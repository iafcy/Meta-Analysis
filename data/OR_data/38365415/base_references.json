            "abstract": "Efforts to reduce the impact of stunting have been largely independent of interventions to reduce the impact of wasting, despite the observation that the conditions can coexist in the same child and increase risk of death. To optimize the management of malnourished children-who can be wasted, stunted, or both-the relationship between stunting and wasting should be elaborated. We aimed to describe the relationship between concurrent weight and height gain during and after rehabilitation from severe wasting. We conducted a secondary analysis of a randomized trial for the outpatient treatment of severe wasting, including 1,542 children who recovered and were followed for 12 weeks. We described the overlap of stunting and severe wasting and the change in stunting over time. We showed the relationship between concurrent weight and height gain using adjusted generalized estimating equations and calculated the mean rate of change in weight-for-height z score (WHZ) and height-for-age z score (HAZ) during and after rehabilitation. At baseline, 79% (n = 1,223/1,542) and 49% (n = 757/1,542) of children were stunted and severely stunted, respectively. Prevalence increased over time among children <24 months. During rehabilitation when weight was not yet fully recovered, we found rapid WHZ gain but limited HAZ gain. Following successful rehabilitation, WHZ gain slowed. The rate of HAZ gain was negative after rehabilitation but increased relative to the period during treatment. The potential relationship between weight and height gain calls for increased coverage of wasting treatment to not only prevent child mortality but also reduce linear growth faltering."

A total of 290 faecal specimen, 170 from mucoid diarrhoea and 120 from watery diarrhoea were examined for faecal leucocyte count under high power field (hpf) from rural children below four years of age during the period from November 1992 to October 1995. Faecal leucocyte count > 10/hpf was noted in 45.9% of mucoid diarrhoea as against 19.2% of watery diarrhoea (p < 0.0001) samples. From faecal samples with > 10 faecal leucocyte count, invasive pathogens could be recovered in 19 (24.5%) to none of 23 patients with watery diarrhoea (p < 0.006 Fisher exact test). This sample test appears to be of value as an indicator of invasiveness in mucoid diarrhoea in the absence of culture facility."

            "abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine age and sex variations in the prevalence of underweight and stunting, and to assess the impact of some socio-economic variables on undernutrition among 6-16 year old school children of Bengalee ethnicity in Chapra, West Bengal, India. The subjects were selected randomly from various schools and madrassas of the Chapra Block. A total of 725 children (342 boys and 383 girls) aged 6-16 years were measured and data on their socio-economic status were collected. Age and sex combined rates of underweight and stunting were 44.40% and 37.20%, respectively. Weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) showed significant association with per-capita income (PCI) among boys (F=5.45) and girls (F=8.14). Height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) has also shown the association with per-capita income among boys (F=4.43) and girls (F=9.69). The WAZ was significantly associated with fathers' educational status (FOS) (t=-2.95) and the number of living rooms (NLR) (t=-2.91) among girls. The HAZ showed significant association with number of siblings (NS) among girls (F=4.25). Linear regression analyses revealed that NLR (t=2.04) and NS (t=1.95) had a significant impact on HAZ among boys. Among girls, PCI (t=3.38), FOS (t=2.87) and NLR (t=2.81) had a significant impact on WAZ and also PCI (t=3.28) and FOS (t=2.90) had a significant impact on HAZ. NLR had significant associations with underweight (χ(2)=3.59) and stunting (χ(2)=4.20) among boys. Among girls, PCI had significant associations with underweight (χ(2)=11.15) and stunting (χ(2)=11.64). FOS also showed significant associations with underweight (χ(2)=8.10) as well as stunting (χ(2)=8.28) among girls. NLR showed a significant association with underweight (χ(2)=7.75). Logistics regression analyses revealed that FOS (Wald=8.00) and NLR (Wald=4.09) were significant predictors of stunting among boys. Among girls, PCI was a significant predictor of underweight (Wald=10.95) as well as stunting (Wald=10.45). FOS, NLR and NS were also significant predictors of stunting (Wald=8.16), underweight (Wald=7.68) and stunting (Wald=6.97) respectively. The present study revealed that the nutritional status of the children was unsatisfactory and it is of paramount importance not only to increase the amount of food supplementation given but also to promote gender equality."

            "abstract": "The health and nutrition of the global adolescent population have been under-researched, in spite of its significant size (1.2 billion). This study investigates the prevalence and associated factors of malnutrition (stunting, thinness and overweight) among adolescents living in South Asia. The sample analysed was 24,053 South Asian schooled adolescents aged 12-15 years that participated in the cross-sectional Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS) between 2009 and 2016. The prevalence of stunting, thinness and overweight was calculated using the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Reference 2007. Associations between the three forms of malnutrition and their possible associated factors were assessed with binary logistic regression analysis using bootstrapping as a resampling method. The overall prevalence of stunting in South Asia was 13%, thinness was 10.8% and overweight was 10.8%. In the logistic regression model of the overall pooled sample, the factors associated with adolescent malnutrition were: age, hygiene behaviours, social support, sedentary behaviour, and tobacco use. A substantial proportion of stunting, thinness and overweight was found among school-going South Asian adolescents, indicating that the double burden of malnutrition is present in this population. Future research should seek to further understand the relationship between all forms of malnutrition and its associated factors in the adolescent population."

In northern coastal Ecuador, the construction of new roads created a remoteness gradient among villages, providing a unique opportunity to examine the impact of roads on child nutritional outcomes 10 years after the road was built. Anthropometric and haemoglobin measurements were collected from 2,350 children <5 years in Esmeraldas, Ecuador, from 2004 to 2013 across 28 villages with differing road access. Logistic generalized estimating equation models assessed the longitudinal association between village remoteness and prevalence of stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight, obesity, and anaemia. We examined the influence of socio-economic characteristics on the pathway between remoteness and nutrition by comparing model results with and without household-level socio-economic covariates. Remoteness was associated with stunting (OR = 0.43, 95% CI [0.30, 0.63]) and anaemia (OR = 0.56, 95% CI [0.44, 0.70]). Over time, the prevalence of stunting was generally decreasing but remained higher in villages closer to the road compared to those farther away. Obesity increased (0.5% to 3%) over time; wasting was high (6%) but stable during the study period. Wealth and education partially explained the better nutritional outcomes in remote vs. road villages more than a decade after some communities gained road access.

Variables found statistically significantly associated with stunting, wasting, or anemia in bivariate analysis were placed in an age-specific logistic regression model for that outcome. Overall, anthropometric indices were available for 9228 children and hemoglobin concentrations were available for 5681 children. Logistic regression found relatively few variables associated with nutrition outcomes in children younger than 6 months. More variables were associated with nutrition outcomes in children aged 6 to 23 months. Such variables measured a wide variety of conditions, including estimated birth size, child health and nutritional status, child caring practices, mother's nutritional and health status, and household water source and sanitation. A similarly broad range of variables was statistically significantly associated with one or more nutrition outcomes in children aged 24 to 59 months. Few of the standard infant and young child feeding indicators were associated with any nutrition outcome.

We followed the World Health Organization child growth reference standards to define anthropometric failures (i.e., height-for-age z score < -2 SD for stunting, weight-for-age z score < -2 SD for underweight, and weight-for-height z score < -2 SD for wasting), and the Indian Council of Medical Research recommended dietary allowance (RDA) to define adequacy in intake of calorie, protein, and fat. We used descriptive and regression-based assessments to test the association between the two indicators of nutritional failure and also computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting was 28.6%, 24.3%, and 12.8%, respectively, whereas 78.2%, 27.4%, and 50.8% of the children had below RDA norms consumption of calorie, protein, and fat, respectively. We found weak-to-null correlation between anthropometric failures and food failures (Pearson correlation ranging from -0.013 to 0.147) and poor discriminatory accuracy (AUC < 0.62), suggesting that in the Indian context, anthropometric failures are not directly associated with food intake. This finding highlights the need for improving adequate intake of macronutrients and draws attention toward adopting a multifactorial approach to improve child nutrition in India. Poor food intake itself merits exclusive policy focus as it is an important nutrition and health concern."

            "abstract": "Rural areas largely lack access to improved drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) facilities in India. This requires documentation of WaSH practices at the local level for better understanding and sustainable development. In this paper, a global positioning system (GPS)-based household survey was carried out in 67 villages of Phagi tehsil using individual questionnaires to evaluate the existing WaSH conditions spatially at the panchayat level. Three sub-indices were used for WaSH risk areas mapping and prediction with the integration of machine learning algorithms. Survey results indicate the improvement in the availability of toilet facilities; however, a gap was found between toilet ownership and its usage by villagers. Data show that only six panchayats have almost zero open defecation practices among the 32 panchayats of Phagi tehsil. The findings highlight that presence of toilets in house, water supply in toilets, and high literacy rate lead to an increase in toilet usage by the population. WaSH index scores indicate that panchayats like Mandawari, Mendwas, Chandma Kalan, and Rotwara have worst conditions and fall in the high-risk category. Moreover, support vector machine regression (SVMR) results reveal that WaSH scores are mainly affected by open defecation (r = 0.94), water supply in toilets (r = 0.92), and female members' participation in sanitation facilities decision-making (r = 0.53), followed by literacy rate (r = 0.33). Findings demonstrate the association between gender inequalities and WaSH conditions, and the potential of the WaSH index as a monitoring tool by local policymakers to shrink the WaSH gaps."

The objective of the evaluation was to examine the extent to which the infrastructure and systems left behind by the project contributed to the improvement of household food security, and health and nutritional outcomes in Maewo island, using Ambae island as a comparator The household food security of 817 households selected by a two stage cluster sampling method was assessed using a modified version of the Radimer-Comell hunger scale and the US National Measure of food security. Anthropometric measurement in children (6-59 months) and mortality data were also obtained. The prevalence of food insecurity without hunger was estimated at 15.3% (95%CI: 12.1% to 19.2%) in Maewo versus 38.2% (95%CI: 33.6% to 43.0%) in Ambae while food insecurity with hunger in children did not vary by location. After controlling for age, gender and household food security status, children aged 6-59 months in Maewo were less likely to be underweight than children of the same age in Ambae (OR: 0.66, 95%CI 0.38 to 0.99). No difference was detected between the two locations in terms of stunting and wasting prevalence. The crude mortality rate (CMR) was lower in Maewo (CTvIIR=0.47/10,000/day, 95%CI: 0.39 to 0.55) than Ambae (CMR= 0.59/10,000/day, 95%CI: 0.51 to 0.67) but no difference existed in mortality in children under five years old. The major causes of death were similar in both locations and the causes frequently reported were malaria, acute respiratory infection and dianheal diseases. The evaluation found that Maewo had better health and nutrition outcomes but the infrastructure left behind by the project and the livelihood system may have been weakened by cyclone Ivy that devastated the region from 25 to 27 February 2004."

Out of 517 water samples, collected from different sources, stored water (washing) showed higher prevalence of fecal coliforms (58%) (p < 0.0001) in comparison with stored (drinking) samples (28%) and tap/tubewell water (8%) respectively. Among different sources, stored water (washing) samples had the highest non-permissible range of physico-chemical parameters. Fecal coliform levels in household water containers (washing) were comparatively high and almost 2/3 of these samples failed to reach the satisfactory level of residual chlorine. Interestingly, 7% stored water (washing) samples were found to be harboring Vibrio cholerae Improper usage of stored water and unsafe/poor sanitation practices such as hand washing etc. are highlighted as contributory factors for sustained diarrheal episodes. Vulnerability of stored water for domestic usage, a hitherto unexplored source, at domiciliary level in an urban slum where enteric infections are endemic, is reported for the first time. This attempt highlights the impact of quality of stored water at domiciliary level for fecal-oral contamination vis-à-vis disease transmission."

            "abstract": "The process of disease transmission is determined by the interaction of host susceptibility and exposure to parasite infectious stages. Host behavior is an important determinant of the likelihood of exposure to infectious stages but is difficult to measure and often assumed to be homogenous in models of disease spread. We evaluated the importance of precisely defining host contact when using networks that estimate exposure and predict infection prevalence in a replicated, empirical system. In particular, we hypothesized that infection patterns would be predicted only by a contact network that is defined according to host behavior and parasite life cycle. Two competing host contact criteria were used to construct networks defined by parasite life cycle and social contacts. First, parasite-defined contacts were based on shared space with a time delay corresponding to the environmental development time of nematode parasites with a direct fecal-oral life cycle. Second, social contacts were defined by shared space in the same time period. To quantify the competing networks of exposure and infection, we sampled natural populations of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and infection of their gastrointestinal helminth community using replicated longitudinal capture-mark-recapture techniques. We predicted that (1) infection with parasites with direct fecal-oral life cycles would be explained by the time delay contact network, but not the social contact network; (2) infection with parasites with trophic life cycles (via a mobile intermediate host; thus, spatially decoupling transmission from host contact) would not be explained by either contact network. The prevalence of fecal-oral life cycle nematode parasites was strongly correlated to the number and strength of network connections from the parasite-defined network (including the time delay), while the prevalence of trophic life cycle parasites was not correlated with any network metrics. We concluded that incorporating the parasite life cycle, relative to the way that exposure is measured, is key to inferring transmission and can be empirically quantified using network techniques. In addition, appropriately defining and measuring contacts according the life history of the parasite and relevant behaviors of the host is a crucial step in applying network analyses to empirical systems."

Of the index children admitted in daily programs (n=51), 80.4% reached target WHZ, which was higher than in weekly programs (72.9%; n=48) by a similar length of stay of about 6 weeks. Weight gain of the children in daily programs was higher (3.1±3.6 g/kg body weight/day) than in weekly programs (2.0±2.1 g/kg body weight/day), and they achieved significantly higher WHZ at discharge. However, the majority of caretakers preferred weekly programs due to lower time constraints. Locally produced RUF in the form of biscuits for treatment of mild wasting among children demonstrated promising results both in daily and weekly community-based intervention programs."

Child wasting exceeded 20% in central and high-conflict regions that bordered Pakistan including east, southeast, and south. Among mothers, dual burden of underweight and overweight or obesity existed in districts of north, northeast, central, and central highlands (prevalence of 15-20%). Linear growth and weight of children were independently associated with household wealth, maternal literacy, maternal anthropometry, child age, food security, geography, and improved hygiene and sanitation conditions. The mother's body-mass index was determined by many of the same factors, in addition to ethnolinguistic status and parity.

Ecuador has an unusually high ratio of male to female infant mortality, but gender norms have been reported to favor boys. This analysis of baseline data from the Lulun Project, a randomized controlled trial conducted in rural Andean communities of Ecuador, investigates the roles of sex and gender in undernutrition among infants 6 to 9 months of age. Twenty-four-hour recall frequencies were used to assess dietary intake. Food outcome models were analyzed as prevalence ratios calculated using a binomial distribution with a log link or robust Poisson regression. Linear regression was used to analyze the continuous growth outcome length-for-age z score. Socioeconomic and health history variables were comparable between male and female infants. Boys were more often fed liquids other than breastmilk within their first 3 days of life (17.1% vs. 5.2%, P = 0.026). Compared with girls, boys were less likely to be fed eggs by 33% (95% CI 0.46, 0.96), cheese, yogurt, or other milk products by 40% (95% CI 0.39, 0.92), yellow fruit by 44% (95% CI 0.33, 0.97), water by 37% (95% CI 0.45, 0.88), thin porridge by 29% (95% CI 0.56, 0.92), and tea without milk by 67% (95% CI 0.11, 0.99).

In combination with pathological findings in clinical oxyuridosis obtained from necropsied animals, our findings call for further, detailed investigations on pathogenesis and immunology of oxyurids in pet reptiles. Coprological analyses for parasite detection should be mandatory before tortoises are transferred to a new owner, animal group, or public and private enclosures such as zoos.

In Ethiopia, the prevalence of childhood undernutrition and food insecurity is highly pronounced. However, whether household food insecurity predicts undernutrition in children was not yet well established. Thus, the aim of the present study was to identify the link between household food access and undernutrition in children aged 6-23 months in West Oromia zones, Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 525 households during June-October 2016. Food access was measured as Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Semistructured interviewer-administered questionnaires were employed to collect data on sociodemographics, child health, child dietary practices, household food security, and anthropometrics. The height and weight of children aged 6-23 months in each household were measured. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between household food insecurity and child nutritional status measured from undernutrition indicators.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, more than two-thirds (69%) of households were classified as food insecure (had insufficient access to adequate food), with a mean (SD) household food access score of 7.9 (7.7). The respective prevalence of mild and moderate food-insecure households was 56.6% and 12.4%. Higher proportions of children in food-insecure households were stunted (41.8% vs. 15.5%), underweight (22.0% vs. 6.1%), and wasted (14.9% vs. 6.1%). Overall, the prevalence of child undernutrition was 21.3% in the target population, with 16.2% stunted, 6.9% underweight, and 6.3% wasted. The present finding shows food-secure households were 54% protective (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.25-0.84) for child undernutrition. Compared to children in food-secure households, children who were reportedly living in moderately food-insecure households were over twice more likely stunted (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.02-4.28) and over 4 times more likely underweight (OR: 4.73, 95% CI: 1.81-12.35). However, household food insecurity was not a correlate for acute malnutrition (wasting) in children.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of household's food insecurity situation is very common and more pronounced among households with undernourished children aged 6-23 months in Ethiopia. The analysis of this work shows that moderately food-insecure households are a salient predictor for composite undernutrition, stunting, and underweight, but not for wasting. Thus, this finding informs the need for multisectoral strategies and policies to combat household's food insecurity and multiple forms of child undernutrition, beyond the socioeconomic wellbeing."

Little is known about how children progress from one manifestation of undernutrition to another as they grow older, nor how intervention strategies need to consider the potential overlap of these manifestations of undernutrition. While much is known about the causes of growth faltering in general, much less is known about which pre-disposing contextual and biological factors cause children to become stunted as opposed to wasted or both. Increasingly, nutrition researchers have tended to focus on one form of malnutrition or the other, lacking an integrated framework for understanding both phenomena. Similarly, some practitioner communities focus on prevention of stunting while others focus on recuperative treatment of wasting. The fragmentation of interests and perspectives on childhood undernutrition has negative consequences for advocacy efforts that aim to bring attention and resources to child nutrition across the globe. It also has serious implications for how children worldwide receive nutrition interventions and services.

Prevalence rates of stunting, underweight, and wasting were 25.7%, 5.9%, and 1.3%, respectively. Even after controlling for confounding, the prevalence rates of underweight and stunting were higher among children in the North region, in low socioeconomic status households, in households with poorer sanitary conditions, with anemic mothers, with low birthweight, and who were hospitalized during the prior 6 months. A protective effect of breastfeeding for underweight was observed for children under 12 months.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The elevated rate of stunting observed in indigenous children approximates that of non-indigenous Brazilians four decades ago, before major health reforms greatly reduced its occurrence nationwide. Prevalence rates of undernutrition were associated with socioeconomic variables including income, household goods, schooling, and access to sanitation services, among other variables. Providing important baseline data for future comparison, these findings further suggest the relevance of social, economic, and environmental factors at different scales (local, regional, and national) for the nutritional status of indigenous peoples."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Intestinal parasitic infection (IPIs) is one of the major health problems in Sub -Saharan Africa where water, sanitation and hygiene practices are inadequate. Taking into account the national level implementation of intensive hand hygiene against COVID-19 pandemic and general protective effect this study assessed its effect on intestinal parasite.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      This study aim to investigate the effect of compliance to hand hygiene practice on the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection (IPIs) and intensity of Soil transmitted helminthes (STH) among patients attending tertiary care hospital in southern Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Observational study was conducted from June to September 2021. Data on socio demographic, hand hygiene practice and intestinal parasite (prevalence and intensity of helminthic infection) was collected from randomly selected and consented patients. Compliance to hand hygiene practice was assessed using pre-tested questionnaire. Fresh stool sample from each participant was examined by direct wet mount, concentration and Ziehl-Neelson (ZN) staining technique to detect intestinal parasite. Intensity of STH measurements was done through direct egg-count per gram using Kato Katz methods. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 25. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval was used to measure association and p-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study population (N = 264) consisted of 139(52.65%) male and 125 (47.34%) female with the mean ages of 36 ±16.12(±SD). The proportion of good compliance to hand hygiene during COVID-19 to was 43.93% (95%CI: 37% to 47) and prevalence of intestinal parasite was 26.14% (95%CI:21.2% to 31.75) comprising 23.48% intestinal protozoa and 6.43% of soil transmitted helminthic infection. Gardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, Ascaris lumbricoides were the common parasite in the study area with prevalence of 15.53%, 6.44%, and 1.52% respectively. Prevalence of intestinal parasite among participants with good compliance to hand hygiene group and poor compliance to hand hygiene were (14.65% vs. 35.13%)(AOR: 0.48,95%CI:0.13 to 0.68) (p = 0.002) implying that good compliance to hand hygiene can reduce the risk of IPIs by 52%. Moreover significantly lower odds of intestinal protozoa among good compliance to hand hygiene group than the control (OR:0.38; (95%CI: 0.20 to 0.71);P = 0.001. However, no significant difference in the odds of intensity of STH infection in good compliance hand hygiene and poor compliance group. The result of this study also confirmed the association between intestinal parasitic infections and younger /adolescent age, education status, habit of eating raw vegetable and figure nail status.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Good hand hygiene compliance during COVID-19 significantly associated with reduction of intestinal parasitic infection. This finding highlights the secondary protective effect of improved hand hygiene against IPIs and suggest it can used in augmenting the existing parasitic control strategies in the study setting."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of prenatal and postnatal malnutrition on the intellectual functioning of early school-aged children. We followed the offspring of women who had participated in a trial of prenatal supplementation with different combinations of micronutrients and who remained resident in the study field. We measured their intellectual functioning using the Wechsler intelligence scale for children (WISC-IV). Height-for-age, weight-for-age, and body mass index (BMI)-for-age were used as anthropometric nutritional status indices. Four of the 5 composite scores derived from the WISC-IV, except for working memory index (WMI), were significantly lower in low birth weight children after adjusting for confounds. All 5 composite scores, including full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), verbal comprehension index (VCI), WMI, perceptual reasoning index (PRI), and processing speed index (PSI) were significant lower in stunted and underweight children. The differences in the means of WISC-IV test scores were greatest between stunted and nonstunted children. The means for FSIQ, VCI, WMI, PRI, and PSI were as follows: 5.88 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.84-8.92), 5.08 (95% CI: 1.12-8.41), 4.71 (95% CI: 1.78-7.66), 6.13 (95% CI: 2.83-9.44), and 5.81 (95% CI: 2.61-9.00). These means were lower in stunted children after adjusting for confounds. Our results suggest the important influences of low birth weight and postnatal malnutrition (stunting, low body weight) on intellectual functioning in early school-aged children."

            "abstract": "A case-control study of environmental and behavioural risk factors for childhood diarrhoea was conducted in Kurunegala district, Sri Lanka. From five hospitals, 2458 children aged less than 5 years and suffering from diarrhoea were recruited as clinic cases, and a further 4140 reporting with complaints other than diarrhoea were recruited as clinic controls. Community-based cross-sectional surveys were also conducted in three of the five areas served by these hospitals, and from these a further 1659 children were recruited as community controls. Children from households where excreta were reported to be disposed of in a latrine were less likely to have diarrhoea than children whose families improperly disposed of excreta. The results obtained from comparisons of cases with clinic controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] : 1.01-1.98), and of cases with community controls (OR 1.35, 95% CI : 0.85-2.13) were in agreement, suggesting that no important selection bias operated on this association. If the observed proportion (91%) of improper excreta disposal among the population could be reduced to 50%, 12% of childhood diarrhoea episodes would be prevented. Although latrine ownership may be a necessary condition for safe excreta disposal behaviour, diarrhoeal morbidity may only be reduced in Sri Lanka if behavioural changes take place concomitant with the construction of sanitation facilities."

Children 23 months or younger, however, have only been partially exposed to these conditions, implying that statistical associations between these conditions and child growth may be substantially smaller in samples that include younger children.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To test the prediction that associations between child anthropometric outcomes and various socioeconomic conditions are systematically different for older and younger children.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed data for 699,421 children aged 0-59 months, drawn from 125 DHS implemented between 1992 and 2014 in 57 countries.

Stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected from diarrhoeal cases over two years and routinely on a monthly basis. Stool samples from children with diarrhoea were compared with stool samples from children without diarrhoea to calculate rates of isolation and pathogenicity of agents. In total, 1750 stool specimens from diarrhoea patients and 5679 stool specimens from children without diarrhoea were tested. An infectious agent was identified in 58% of the stool specimens from diarrhoea patients and 21.6% of the stool specimens from children without diarrhoea. The most commonly-isolated pathogens from all specimens were enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), enteroadherent E. coli, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni, Giardia, and rotavirus. ETEC (ST and LT-ST toxin), enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Shigella, and rotavirus were associated more with disease than with asymptomatic infections. Aetiology-specific infections were associated with acute episodes. The isolated enteropathogens were essentially the same as those found in other tropical rural settings. Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis was also identified as a pathogen. Ongoing vaccine efforts focusing on Shigella, rotavirus, and ETEC would be useful."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The relationship between poor sanitation and the parasitic infection schistosomiasis is well-known, but still rarely investigated directly and quantitatively. In a Brazilian village we correlated the spatial concentration of human fecal contamination of its main river and the prevalence of schistosomiasis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We validated three bacterial markers of contamination in this population by high throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and qPCR of feces from local residents. The qPCR of genetic markers from the 16S rRNA gene of Bacteroides-Prevotella group, Bacteroides HF8 cluster, and Lachnospiraceae Lachno2 cluster as well as sequencing was performed on georeferenced samples of river water. Ninety-six percent of residents were examined for schistosomiasis.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Sequence of 16S rRNA DNA from stool samples validated the relative human specificity of the HF8 and Lachno 2 fecal indicators compared to animals. The concentration of fecal contamination increased markedly along the river as it passed an increasing proportion of the population on its way downstream as did the sequence reads from bacterial families associated with human feces. Lachnospiraceae provided the most robust signal of human fecal contamination. The prevalence of schistosomiasis likewise increased downstream. Using a linear regression model, a significant correlation was demonstrated between the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and local concentration of human fecal contamination based on the Lachnospiraceae Lachno2 cluster (r2 0.53) as compared to the correlation with the general fecal marker E. coli (r2 0.28).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Fecal contamination in rivers has a downstream cumulative effect. The transmission of schistosomiasis correlates with very local factors probably resulting from the distribution of human fecal contamination, the limited movement of snails, and the frequency of water contact near the home. In endemic regions, the combined use of human associated bacterial markers and GIS analysis can quantitatively identify areas with risk for schistosomiasis as well as assess the efficacy of sanitation and environmental interventions for prevention."

            "abstract": "A community-based cross-sectional study was undertaken in the tribal areas of Odisha state, India, covering 1951 preschool children to assess their nutritional status in terms of underweight, stunting, and wasting; its correlates; and seasonal variation in nutritional status. χ(2) Test, one-way analysis of variance, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were used for data analysis. The prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting was 58%, 65%, and 20%, respectively. The risk of underweight and stunting was, respectively, 1.9 and 2.4 times higher among children of illiterate mothers, whereas underweight and wasting was 1.4 times higher among children who had morbidities during the preceding fortnight. The prevalence of undernutrition was significantly (P < .01) higher during monsoon as compared with winter season. Undernutrition is an important public health problem and is associated with literacy of mother, morbidity, and season. Thus, improving socioeconomic condition, literacy, and sanitation along with insuring food security during monsoon season might improve nutritional status."

This study assessed the association between residential district multi-hazard-risk and undernutrition among children aged less than 5 years (under-5) in Bangladesh. Data for 22,055 under-5 children were extracted from the 2019 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of Bangladesh. Multi-hazard risk was categorized as low (score<10), moderate (score 10-20), and high (score>20) using a combined score of four major hazards: tornado, cyclone, earthquake, and flood. We found that children from high multi-hazard risk districts were 19% more likely to be stunted and 23% more likely to be underweight compared to low-risk districts. However, wasting was not associated with multi-hazard risk. Strategies such as agricultural adaptation and coping mechanisms, long-term post-disaster nutritional response, extended periods of relief supports, and enhanced quality maternal and child care services may help to reduce undernutrition burdens in Bangladesh."

More than 150 million children under the age of five years in the developing world are malnourished. Ethiopia is one of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa with the highest rates of malnutrition. In Ethiopia, 44.4% and 9.7% of children under-five years old were stunted and wasted, respectively.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Boiling, disinfecting, and filtering water within the home can improve the microbiological quality of drinking water among the hundreds of millions of people who rely on unsafe water supplies. However, the impact of these interventions on diarrhoea is unclear. Most studies using open trial designs have reported a protective effect on diarrhoea while blinded studies of household water treatment in low-income settings have found no such effect. However, none of those studies were powered to detect an impact among children under five and participants were followed-up over short periods of time. The aim of this study was to measure the effect of in-home water disinfection on diarrhoea among children under five.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a double-blind randomised controlled trial between November 2010 and December 2011. The study included 2,163 households and 2,986 children under five in rural and urban communities of Orissa, India. The intervention consisted of an intensive promotion campaign and free distribution of sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets during bi-monthly households visits. An independent evaluation team visited households monthly for one year to collect health data and water samples. The primary outcome was the longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea (3-day point prevalence) among children aged under five. Weight-for-age was also measured at each visit to assess its potential as a proxy marker for diarrhoea. Adherence was monitored each month through caregiver's reports and the presence of residual free chlorine in the child's drinking water at the time of visit. On 20% of the total household visits, children's drinking water was assayed for thermotolerant coliforms (TTC), an indicator of faecal contamination. The primary analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. Binomial regression with a log link function and robust standard errors was used to compare prevalence of diarrhoea between arms. We used generalised estimating equations to account for clustering at the household level. The impact of the intervention on weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) was analysed using random effect linear regression. Over the follow-up period, 84,391 child-days of observations were recorded, representing 88% of total possible child-days of observation. The longitudinal prevalence of diarrhoea among intervention children was 1.69% compared to 1.74% among controls. After adjusting for clustering within household, the prevalence ratio of the intervention to control was 0.95 (95% CI 0.79-1.13). The mean WAZ was similar among children of the intervention and control groups (-1.586 versus -1.589, respectively). Among intervention households, 51% reported their child's drinking water to be treated with the tablets at the time of visit, though only 32% of water samples tested positive for residual chlorine. Faecal contamination of drinking water was lower among intervention households than controls (geometric mean TTC count of 50 [95% CI 44-57] per 100 ml compared to 122 [95% CI 107-139] per 100 ml among controls [p<0.001] [n = 4,546]).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our study was designed to overcome the shortcomings of previous double-blinded trials of household water treatment in low-income settings. The sample size was larger, the follow-up period longer, both urban and rural populations were included, and adherence and water quality were monitored extensively over time. These results provide no evidence that the intervention was protective against diarrhoea. Low compliance and modest reduction in water contamination may have contributed to the lack of effect. However, our findings are consistent with other blinded studies of similar interventions and raise additional questions about the actual health impact of household water treatment under these conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.govNCT01202383 Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary."

Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration was measured with use of a hemoglobinometer (HemoCue, AB), as per global recommendations. Overall, adjusted anemia prevalence was 12% in non-pregnant women (Hb < 120 g/L), 26% in pregnant women (Hb < 110 g/L), and 42% in children (Hb < 110 g/L), but it varied widely depending on whether or not the controversial factor of ethnicity was adjusted for (range of 6-26%, 22-30%, and 35-68% prevalence, respectively). Thirty-nine percent (n = 133/344) of non-pregnant women and 52% (n = 12/23) of pregnant women were underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2).

Conducted from February to December 2018 in rural Malawi, this before and after trial with a control used diarrhoeal disease as a primary outcome, to measure the impact of a food hygiene intervention (food hygiene + handwashing) relative to a food hygiene and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) intervention (food hygiene + handwashing + faeces management + water management). The 31-week intervention was delivered by community-based coordinators through community events (n = 2), cluster group meetings (n = 17) and household visits (n = 14). Diarrhoeal disease was self-reported and measured through an end line survey, and daily diaries completed by caregivers. Difference-in-differences results show a 13-percentage point reduction in self-reported diarrhoea compared to the control group. There were also significant increases in the presence of proxy measures in each of the treatment groups (e.g., the presence of soap). We conclude that food hygiene interventions (including hand washing with soap) can significantly reduce diarrhoeal disease prevalence in children under five years in a low-income setting. Therefore, the promotion of food hygiene practices using a behaviour-centred approach should be embedded in nutrition and WASH policies and programming."

PSAC and SAC in two Haiyan-stricken provinces were examined using Kato-Katz technique and ELISA Antibody test. Anthropometric and hemoglobin measurements were also obtained. The reported sanitary toilet coverage was validated in a survey. The prevalence of any STH in PSAC and SAC was 50.2% and 41.3%, respectively. Moderate-heavy intensity (MHI) STH prevalence in PSAC and SAC was 20.8% and 5.9%, respectively. The prevalence of any STH, MHI STH, ascariasis, MHI ascariasis, and MHI trichuriasis was significantly higher in PSAC. Stunting, underweight, wasting, overweight/obesity, and anemia prevalence was 38.4%, 24.5%, 4.8%, 2.7%, and 34.7% in PSAC, while the prevalence was 34.3%, 21.6%, 8.7%, 3.0%, and 19.2% in SAC, respectively. Anemia and wasting prevalence were significantly higher in PSAC and SAC, respectively. There were five schistosomiasis cases found (0.8% prevalence), while schistosomiasis seroprevalence was 60.1%. Validated and reported sanitary toilet coverage was significantly different in eight out of 13 barangays. Stunting and anemia were associated with STH. STH and anemia prevalence were significantly higher in non-ZOD barangays. High STH burden in PSAC and SAC persists. A more coordinated response addressing STH, undernutrition, and WASH in disaster-stricken areas will require strengthening local health systems and promoting intersectoral collaboration."

Epidemiological research carried out in different countries has shown that the social and economical situation of the individuals is an important cause in the prevalence of intestinal parasites. Previous studies in Turkey revealed a high prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection. The objectives of the current study were to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in Aydin among 7-14 years old school children and to identify associated socio-demographic and environmental factors, behavioral habits and also related complaints.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Multistage sampling was used in the selection of the study sample. A questionnaire, cellulose adhesive and a stool specimen examination were done.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 456 stool specimens were collected. 145 students (31.8%) were infected with one or more intestinal parasites. 29 (6.4%) of the students were infected more than one parasite, 26 (5.7%) with two parasites and 3 (0.7%) with three parasites. The three most common were E. vermicularis, G. intestinalis and E. coli. Intestinal parasite prevalence was higher in rural area, in children with less than primary school educated mother, in children who use hands for washing anal area after defecation, and in children who use toilet paper sometimes or never. The relation between child health and mother education is well known. Children were traditionally taught to wash anal area by hand. Toiler paper usage was not common and might be due to low income or just a behavioral habit also. Most of the complaints of the study population were not significantly related with the intestinal parasitic infection.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Intestinal parasitic infection is an important public health problem in Aydin, Turkey. Rural residence, mother education less than primary school, sometimes or never usage of toilet paper, and washing anal area by hands after defecation were the significant associations. Interventions including health education on personal hygiene to the students and to the parents, especially to mothers are required. The ratio of uneducated women should be declined with specific programs. A multisectoral approach is needed."

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, community-based intervention trial with 702 children randomly allocated to receive either albendazole or placebo. The two study groups received two doses of albendazole (400 mg) or placebo six months apart. Mean weight increased significantly in the albendazole group compared to the control group at three months, six months and nine months following treatment (P<0.01, P<0.01 and P<0.001 respectively). The albendazole group also experienced fewer episodes of diarrhoea than their control counterparts (relative risk 1.3, 95% CI 1.07-1.53) with a 28% reduction. The health workers administered the correct dosage satisfactorily and there were no adverse effects. Thus, periodic mass deworming with albendazole would seem to be a safe and effective method that could be adopted at the community level or as an integral part of school health services and could be expected to improve growth and reduce the incidence of diarrhoea in children."

Fecal sampling occurs every two weeks in the \"parasite risk group\", every four to six weeks in the so called \"non-risk group\". Risk group-animals repeatedly show increased fecal egg counts, whereas among non-risk group-animals only ascarid eggs in Przewalski-horses and wild boars can become significant. The animals are treated (metaphylactically) only at a high egg production or at a steadily increasing egg production. A resulting slight but constant reinfection allows the build-up of an immunity, leading thereby to a decreased frequency of treatment. During the monitoring period (1984-1990) only four animals out of 80 post-mortem analysed animals had a diagnoses of an endoparasitoses as a cause of death."

Populations of children from sectors A (n = 418), with significatively greater (SG) total coliform most probable number (MPN), and sector B (n = 400), were examined. PAFS test was used for the stool examination of one sample, from each child. The global prevalence of infection by IPH was similar in A (74.8%) and B (72.5%) sectors. From 10 identified IPH, only Entamoeba histolytica and Hymenolepis nana showed prevalences of infection SG in sector A, than in sector B. The contact of the children with the water of the river showed association with SG prevalences for E. histolytica, Entamoeba coli and Endolimax nana in sector B and for E. histolytica in sector A. No sanitary condition for the different BSE contributed to SG prevalences for E. histolytica, Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura in both sectors, and for E. coli in sector B. The contact with the river water and the different BSE contributed to prevalences SG in 5 and 3 IPH in sectors B and A, respectively. The results suggest that a project in study for the development of a treatment plant of wastewater in sector A, could contribute to control infection by IPH. But, this measure must be associated with improvement of the BSE, health education, and application of chemotherapy measures for geohelminthosis in both sectors."

This study, also, reported STHs integrated control intervention aimed at reducing STHs transmission and worm burden among population at county-level. The intervention strategies included mass drug administration (MDA), health education, improved water supply for drinking, improved sanitary facilities and environmental modification in Guixi municipality. The overall infection rate of STHs in Jiangxi province decreased from 77.7% (1989) to 6.3% (2014), while Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm and Trichuris trichiura decreased from 71.1%, 17.6% and 17.0% (1989) to 0.9%, 4.7% and 1.0% (2014), respectively. STHs infection rates in female population were higher than male in the three surveys. Reduction in STHs prevalence was observed in all age groups, but the decline was less in higher age group. STHs prevalence in Guixi intervention region indicated remarkable reduction from 31.8% (2006) to 6.1% (2009) (χ2＝255.22, P＜0.01).

This study examined associations between household sanitation, fecal contamination, and enteric infection in two low-income neighborhoods in Vellore, India. Surveys and spatial analysis assessed the presence and clustering of toilets and fecal sludge management (FSM) practices in 200 households. Fecal contamination was measured in environmental samples from 50 households and household drains. Enteric infection was assessed from stool specimens from children under 5 years of age in these households. The two neighborhoods differed significantly in toilet coverage (78% versus 33%) and spatial clustering. Overall, 49% of toilets discharged directly into open drains (\"poor FSM\"). Children in households with poor FSM had 3.78 times higher prevalence of enteric infection when compared with children in other households, even those without toilets. In the neighborhood with high coverage of household toilets, children in households with poor FSM had 10 times higher prevalence of enteric infection than other children in the neighborhood and drains in poor FSM clusters who had significantly higher concentrations of genogroup II norovirus. Conversely, children in households with a toilet that contained excreta in a tank onsite had 55% lower prevalence of enteric infection compared with the rest of the study area. Notably, households with a toilet in the neighborhood with low toilet coverage had more fecal contamination on floors where children played compared with those without a toilet. Overall, both toilet coverage levels and FSM were associated with environmental fecal contamination and, subsequently, enteric infection prevalence in this urban setting."

We used meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect where appropriate, or described the study results narratively. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-three studies covering more than 222,800 participants met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-two studies were cluster RCTs, four were controlled before-and-after studies (CBA), and 37 were NRS (27 case-control studies (one that included seven study sites), three controlled cohort studies, and seven controlled cross-sectional studies). Most study sites (56/69) were in low- or lower middle-income settings. Among studies using experimental study designs, most interventions included child faeces disposal messages along with other health education messages or other water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) hardware and software components. Among observational studies, the main risk factors relevant to this review were safe disposal of faeces in the latrine or defecation of children under five years of age in a latrine.Education and hygiene promotion interventions, including child faeces disposal messages (no hardware provision)Four RCTs found that diarrhoea incidence was lower, reducing the risk by an estimated 30% in children under six years old (rate ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.86; 2 trials, low-certainty evidence). Diarrhoea prevalence measured in two other RCTs in children under five years of age was lower, but evidence was low-certainty (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.04; low-certainty evidence).Two controlled cohort studies that evaluated such an intervention in Bangladesh did not detect a difference on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.28; very low-certainty evidence). Two controlled cross-sectional studies that evaluated the Health Extension Package in Ethiopia were associated with a lower two-week diarrhoea prevalence in 'model' households than in 'non-model households' (odds ratio (OR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.42; very low-certainty evidence).Programmes to end open defecation by all (termed community-led total sanitation (CLTS) interventions plus adaptations)Four RCTs measured diarrhoea prevalence and did not detect an effect in children under five years of age (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.07; moderate-certainty evidence). The analysis of two trials did not demonstrate an effect of the interventions on STH infection prevalence in children (pooled RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.65; low-certainty evidence).One controlled cross-sectional study compared the prevalence of STH infection in open defecation-free (ODF) villages that had received a CLTS intervention with control villages and reported a higher level of STH infection in the intervention villages (RR 2.51, 95% CI 1.74 to 3.62; very low-certainty evidence).Sanitation hardware and behaviour change interventions, that included child faeces disposal hardware and messagingTwo RCTs had mixed results, with no overall effect on diarrhoea prevalence demonstrated in the pooled analysis (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.26; very low-certainty evidence).WASH hardware and education/behaviour change interventionsOne RCT did not demonstrate an effect on diarrhoea prevalence (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.41; very low-certainty evidence).Two CBAs reported that the intervention reduced diarrhoea incidence by about a quarter in children under five years of age, but evidence was very low-certainty (rate ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84). Another CBA reported that the intervention reduced the prevalence of STH in an intervention village compared to a control village, again with GRADE assessed at very low-certainty (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.73).Case-control studiesPooled results from case-control studies that presented data for child faeces disposal indicated that disposal of faeces in the latrine was associated with lower odds of diarrhoea among all ages (OR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.85; 23 comparisons; very low-certainty evidence). Pooled results from case-control studies that presented data for children defecating in the latrine indicated that children using the latrine was associated with lower odds of diarrhoea in all ages (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.90; 7 studies; very low-certainty evidence).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evidence suggests that the safe disposal of child faeces may be effective in preventing diarrhoea. However, the evidence is limited and of low certainty. The limited research on STH infections provides only low and very-low certainty evidence around effects, which means there is currently no reliable evidence that interventions to improve safe disposal of child faeces are effective in preventing such STH infections.While child faeces may represent a source of exposure to young children, interventions generally only address it as part of a broader sanitation initiative. There is a need for RCTs and other rigorous studies to assess the effectiveness and sustainability of different hardware and software interventions to improve the safe disposal of faeces of children of different age groups."

            "abstract": "Poor drinking water quality is one of the main causes of acute diarrheal disease in developing countries. The study investigated the relationship between fecal contamination of hands, stored drinking water, and source waters in India. We further evaluated the environmental and behavioral factors associated with recontamination of water between collection and consumption. The bacterial contamination, that is, Escherichia coli (log10 most probable number per two hands), found on mothers' hands (mean = 1.11, standard deviation [SD] = 1.2, N = 152) was substantially higher than that on their children younger than 5 years (mean = 0.64, SD = 1.0, and N = 152). We found a low level of E. coli (< 1 per 100 mL) in the source water samples; however, E. coli contamination in stored drinking water was above the recommended guidelines of the World Health Organization. The study also found that E. coli on hands was significantly associated with E. coli in the stored drinking water (P < 0.001). Moreover, E. coli was positively associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (odds ratio 1.42, P < 0.05). In the households with elevated levels (> 100 E. coli/100 mL) of fecal contamination, we found that 43.5% had unimproved sanitation facilities, poor water handling practices, and higher diarrheal incidences. The water quality deterioration from the source to the point of consumption is significant. This necessitates effective interventions in collection, transport, storage, and extraction practices when hand-water contact is likely to occur. These findings support the role of hands in the contamination of stored drinking water and suggest that clean source water does not guarantee safe water at the point of consumption."

            "abstract": "Records at the Endulen Hospital in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), Tanzania, reveal that soil-transmitted helminth infections and protozoa are consistently in the top ten diagnoses for Maasai pastoralists, indicating a significant public health concern. Nevertheless, Maasai pastoralist adaptations to life in close proximity to livestock and to unreliable access to water raise important questions about experiences of, and resiliency to, parasitic infections. Though these infections are particularly prevalent among youth in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), a focus on resiliency highlights local capacity to recover from and prevent illness. For instance, how is human parasitism perceived and experienced among communities displaying behaviours that studies have associated with transmission of diarrhoeal diseases, such as open defecation? Among these communities, how is parasitism seen to impact the health and development of children? And, what resources are available to endure or mitigate this heavy disease burden among affected communities? This study draws on formative research carried out in May 2014 in anticipation of an innovative school-based and youth-driven water, sanitation and hygiene education intervention rolled out in two boarding schools in the NCA in subsequent months. The initiative is grounded in a One Health approach to health promotion, drawing on partnerships in medicine, public health and veterinary medicine to appreciate the unique interactions between humans, animals and the environment that shape well-being among pastoralist communities. Qualitative data generated through group discussions with secondary school youth (n=60), Maasai teachers (n=6) and a women's group (n=8) in the NCA convey existing knowledge of the prevalence, prevention and treatment of human parasitism. An underlying principle of the larger initiative is to engage youth as creative agents of change in developing and sustaining locally relevant health promotion strategies. Findings highlight practical knowledge around certain 'neglected tropical diseases', namely helminths, among pastoralist communities in the NCA, in turn feeding into the development of the science fair and related interventions."

A total of 3,683 children aged 5-12 years attending 27 primary schools in 13 Pacific Island countries were surveyed along with school environmental data. Stool samples were collected from 1996 children (54.2%) and analysed for ova and helminths. Total prevalence of helminthiasis was 32.8%. Anaemia prevalence was 12.4%. Children with helminthiasis and anaemia were found to be 8.7 times more likely to be stunted and 4.3 times more likely to be underweight than non-anaemic and non-infected children. Four significant environmental influences on helminthiasis were identified: (1) an inadequate water supply; (2); availability of a school canteen; (3) regular water/sanitation maintenance regimes; and (4) overcrowded classrooms. Helminthiasis was found to be strongly associated with anaemia, stunting and underweight and environmental influences identified. Although mass anti-helminthic drug administrations (MDA) have been taking place, reinfection is common as drug therapy alone is not enough. Programme effectiveness depends upon upgrading school environments to include an adequate water supply, controlled food preparation/provision, well-maintained water/sanitation facilities and class sizes of 30 students or less."

Few studies explore how diarrhoeal mortality varies subnationally, especially by cause, which is important for targeting investments. Even fewer examine indirect effects of diarrhoeal morbidity on child mortality. We estimated the subnational distribution of mortality, morbidity, and childhood stunting attributable to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and shigella infection in children younger than 5 years from 11 eastern and central African countries.

Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Zimbabwe had the greatest subnational heterogeneity in most ETEC and shigella mortality measures.

However, the experimental literature on WASH interventions identifies inconsistent impacts on child health outcomes, with relatively robust impacts on diarrhea and other symptoms of infection but weak and varying impacts on child nutrition. In contrast, observational research exploiting cross-sectional variation in water and sanitation access is much more sanguine, finding strong associations with diarrhea prevalence, mortality, and stunting. In practice, both literatures suffer from significant methodological limitations. Experimental WASH evaluations are often subject to poor compliance, rural bias, and short duration of exposure, while cross-sectional observational evidence may be highly vulnerable to omitted variables bias. To overcome some of the limitations of both literatures, we construct a panel of 442 subnational regions in 59 countries with multiple Demographic Health Surveys. Using this large subnational panel, we implement difference-in-difference regressions that allow us to examine whether longer-term changes in water and sanitation at the subnational level predict improvements in child morbidity, mortality, and nutrition. We find results that are partially consistent with both literatures. Improved water access is statistically insignificantly associated with most outcomes, although water piped into the home predicts reductions in child stunting. Improvements in sanitation predict large reductions in diarrhea prevalence and child mortality but are not associated with changes in stunting or wasting. We estimate that sanitation improvements can account for just under 10 % of the decline in child mortality from 1990 to 2015."

We conducted a multi-stage, cluster-sample, household survey which produced equal-probability samples for preschool-age children (PSAC; 1-4 years), SAC (5-14 years), and adults (≥ 15 years). Standardized questionnaires were administered, using Android-based smart phones running an Open Data Kit application. Stool samples were collected and testing for STH prevalence and infection intensity used the Kato-Katz technique.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In all, 4318 stool samples were collected from 7164 participants. Estimates of STH prevalence by risk group in three of the four surveyed districts ranged from 3.4 to 5.0%, all with upper, 1-sided 95% confidence limits < 10%. However, STH prevalence estimates in Sirajganj District ranged from 23.4 to 29.1%. Infections in that district were spatially focal; four of the 30 survey clusters had > 50% prevalence in at least one risk group. Among all tested specimens, Ascaris lumbricoides was the most common STH parasite [8.2% (n = 352)], followed by Trichuris trichiura [0.9% (n = 37)], and hookworm [0.6% (n = 27)]. In each district, PC coverage among SAC was above the 75% program target but did not exceed 45% among PSAC in any district. Improved sanitation at home, school, or work was over 90% in all districts.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In the three low-prevalence districts, the MOHFW is considering decreasing the frequency of mass drug administration, per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Also, the MOHFW will focus programmatic resources and supervisory efforts on Sirajganj District. Despite considering WHO guidance, the MOHFW will not expand PC administration to women of reproductive age partly due to the low prevalence of hookworm and T. trichiura, the STH parasites that contribute most to morbidity in that risk group. Data collected from surveys such as ours would help effectively guide future STH control efforts in Bangladesh and elsewhere."

The PCR results were evaluated together with the presence of PMWS typical histopathological lesions and the presence of PCV2 antigen. PCV2 DNA was present in the blood of all 12 infected pigs at the end of the experiment and faecal and tonsillar swabs of 11 of the 12 pigs. The rate of PCR-positive serum and plasma samples was significantly higher in four pigs that showed virological and pathological evidence of PMWS, than in infected pigs without evidence of disease. In conclusion this study confirms that PCR cannot substitute for the traditional methods used for diagnosis of PMWS, however, PCR amplification of PCV2 DNA from serum or plasma could be a useful tool to support an early diagnosis of PMWS in live animals."

We aimed to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and its association with length of stay (LOS) among pediatric surgical patients in Kigali, Rwanda.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a prospective observational cohort study. We enrolled surgical patients between 1 month and 15 years of age. We measured the association of acute malnutrition (wasting) and chronic malnutrition (stunting) with postoperative LOS using log-gamma regression to account for the skewed LOS distribution. Adjustment was made for sex, age, elective versus emergency surgery, household income, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 593 children, 124 children (21.2%) had acute malnutrition (wasting) with 39 (6.6%) severely wasted.

Median (interquartile range [IQR]) LOS after surgery was 2 (1-5) days for children with mild/no wasting, 6 (2.5-12.5) days for children with moderate wasting, and 6 (2-15) days with severe wasting. Median (IQR) LOS after surgery was 2 (1-6) days for children with mild/no stunting, 3 (1-3) days for children with moderate stunting, and 5 (2.3-11.8) days with severe stunting malnutrition. After adjustment for confounders, the moderate wasting was associated with increased LOS, with ratio of means (RoM), 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-2.0; P < .0001. Severe wasting was not associated with increased LOS (RoM, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7; P = .12). Severe, but not moderate, stunting was associated with increased LOS (RoM, 1.9; 1.5-2.4; P < .0001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Malnutrition is prevalent in >20% of children presenting for surgery and associated with increased LOS after surgery, even after accounting for individual and family-level confounders. Although some aspects of malnutrition may relate to the surgical condition, severe malnutrition may represent a modifiable social risk factor that could be targeted to improve postoperative outcomes and resource use. Severely stunted children should be identified as at risk of having delayed recovery after surgery."

In this opinion article we aim to determine the evidence for optimal approaches for STH control. First we explore the evidence for the above interventions. We then appraise two integration strategies: current chemotherapy-oriented integrated neglected tropical disease (NTD) control and expanded 'multicomponent integration', which includes integrated chemotherapy, WASH, and other intervention strategies. While multicomponent integrated control may be an effective approach to sustainably reduce STH transmission, there is a need for evidence to prove the feasibility of this approach."

            "abstract": "A survey was carried out to determine the prevalence and seasonal abundance of the egg and adult stages of nematode parasites of sheep and goats in the semi-arid zone of north-eastern Nigeria between January and December 2002. Faecal samples collected from 102 sheep and 147 goats and examined by the modified McMaster technique using saturated solution of sodium chloride as the floating medium revealed that 44 (43.1%) and 82 (55.8%) of the samples, respectively, contained at least one nematode egg type. Three nematode egg types were recovered with strongyle egg type (22.5% in sheep and 35.4% in goats) being the most prevalent followed, respectively, by Trichuris (5.9% in sheep and 4.1% in goats) and Strongyloides (4.9% in sheep and 4.1% in goats) egg types. Mean faecal egg counts were generally moderate in both sheep (1052+/-922 strongyle, 1000+/-590 Strongyloides and 380+/-110 Trichuris eggs, respectively, per g of faeces) and goats (2092+/-3475 strongyle, 958+/-854 Strongyloides and 683+/-512 Trichuris eggs, respectively, per g of faeces) and showed the same trend irrespective of the age or sex of the animals. The prevalence and counts of strongyle nematode eggs showed a definite seasonal sequence that corresponded with the rainfall pattern in the study area during the period. In both sheep and goats, counts of strongyle egg type increased with the rains and reached peak levels at about the peak of the rainy season in September. The other egg types encountered during the study did not show much variation with the season of the year. Out of the 45 sheep and 75 goats examined at necropsy, 27 (60%) and 39 (52%), respectively, contained adult nematode species. Seven genera of adult nematodes including Strongyloides, Trichostrongylus, Haemonchus, Trichuris, Cooperia, Oesophagostomum and Bunostomum species were encountered during the study. Bunostomum species were recorded only in sheep. Adult worm burdens were generally low and showed seasonal variation that corresponded with the rainfall pattern in the study area during the period. Haemonchus and Trichostrongylus species attained peak counts together in both goats (June) and sheep (August). Strongyloides species were encountered throughout the year in both sheep and goats irrespective of the season. Other genera of nematodes encountered occurred in very low numbers and did not allow any meaningful comparison of seasonal sequence. The results suggest that Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus and Strongyloides species may be the major contributors to small ruminant helminthiasis in the study area."

Quantitative microbiological risk assessment (QMRA) was done to determine health risks associated with use of EcoSan. Pathogens considered included Escherichia coli (E. coli), Salmonella, and soil transmitted helminths (STHs). Exponential and Beta Poisson models were used to estimate the risk from helminthic and bacterial pathogens, respectively. Main exposure pathways were through poor storage of sludge, contamination of foods during drying, walking barefoot on the ground contaminated with sludge, pit emptying without protection, and application of sludge in the fields. Estimated annual risk for Ascaris lumbricoides, Taenia, and hookworms was approximately over 5.6 × 10-1 for both Fossa Alternas (FAs) and Urine Diverting Dry Toilet (UDDTs). Risk from E. coli and Salmonella was 8.9 × 10-2 and above. The risks were higher than WHO acceptable risk for use of faecal sludge in crops of 10-4 infections per year. Promoters and users of EcoSan latrines need to consider advocating for strict guidelines to reduce the risk."

            "abstract": "In household wastewater and biodegradable solid waste, the main proportion of the plant nutrients are found in the toilet water (i.e. in urine and faeces). In order to recover most of these nutrients, with the purpose of decreasing the emission of eutrophicating agents and of increasing their recycling, present waste and wastewater systems have to be changed. If the urine and the faeces are collected, up to 91%, 83%, and 59% for N, P and K, respectively, can be recovered and recycled from the household wastewater. The urine was collected separately in a double flushed urine-diverting toilet and the faeces were separated from the flushwater using two parallel Aquatrons. The Aquatron separates by a combination of a whirlpool effect, gravitation and surface tension. In this study, nitrogen and phosphorus from the faeces were separated to 73% and 58%, respectively, to the dryer fraction. The combination of faecal separation and urine diversion in the house Ekoporten made it possible to collect 60% of N, 46% of P and 43% of K from the wastewater, indicating that this method is an alternative when aiming to recover plant nutrients while still wanting to use water-flushed, urine-diverting toilets, though the potential to collect the nutrients is much higher."

Prevalence of concurrence was highest in the 12- to 24-month age group 4.2%, 95% CI [4.1, 4.3], and was significantly higher among boys 3.54%, 95% CI [3.47, 3.61], compared to girls; 2.46%, 95% CI [2.41, 2.52]. Fragile and conflict-affected states reported significantly higher concurrence 3.6%, 95% CI [3.5, 3.6], than those defined as stable 2.24%, 95% CI [2.18, 2.30]. This analysis represents the first multiple country estimation of the prevalence and burden of children concurrently wasted and stunted. Given the high risk of mortality associated with concurrence, the findings indicate a need to report on this condition as well as investigate whether these children are being reached through existing programmes."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      India faces a high burden of child undernutrition. We evaluated the effects of two community strategies to reduce undernutrition among children under 3 years in rural Jharkhand and Odisha, eastern India: (1) monthly Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) meetings with women's groups followed by home visits; (2) crèches for children aged 6 months to 3 years combined with monthly PLA meetings and home visits.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We tested these strategies in a non-randomised, controlled study with baseline and endline cross-sectional surveys. We purposively selected five blocks of Jharkhand and Odisha, and divided each block into three areas. Area 1 served as control. In Area 2, trained local female workers facilitated PLA meetings and offered counselling to mothers of children under three at home. In Area 3, workers facilitated PLA meetings, did home visits, and crèches with food and growth monitoring were opened for children aged 6 months to 3 years. We did a census across all study areas and randomly sampled 4668 children under three and their mothers for interview and anthropometry at baseline and endline. The evaluation's primary outcome was wasting among children under three in areas 2 and 3 compared with area 1, adjusted for baseline differences between areas. Other outcomes included underweight, stunting, preventive and care-seeking practices for children.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We interviewed 83% (3868/4668) of mothers of children under three sampled at baseline, and 76% (3563/4668) at endline. In area 2 (PLA and home visits), wasting among children under three was reduced by 34% (adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR]: 0.66, 95%: 0.51-0.88) and underweight by 25% (aOR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.95), with no change in stunting (aOR: 1.23, 95% CI: 0.96-1.57).

Two different sanitation concepts were tested. One concept comprised the use of gravity separation toilets, the other used vacuum separation toilets. Results from a life-cycle-assessment investigation show that the new sanitation concepts are more sustainable. A cost analysis for an existing residential area did not prove lower costs for the new sanitation concepts in this special case. The experience from this demonstration project shows that prior to a widespread use of the new sanitation concepts, several improvements have to be made. One important issue is the improvement of separation toilets. Since nutrient recycling, water saving and reuse as well energy reduction become more and more important, further research should be undertaken in this field."

            "abstract": "Malnutrition in children under 5 years of age (U5s) is a serious public health problem in low- and middle-income countries including Bangladesh. Improved maternal education can contribute effectively to reduce child malnutrition. We examined the long-term impact of maternal education on the risk of malnutrition in U5s and quantified the level of education required for the mothers to reduce the risk. We used pooled data from five nationwide demographic and health surveys conducted in 1996-1997, 1999-2000, 2004, 2007 and 2011 in Bangladesh involving 28 941 U5s. A log-binomial regression model was used to examine the association between maternal education (no education, primary, secondary or more) and malnutrition in children, measured by stunting, underweight and wasting controlling for survey time, maternal age, maternal body mass index, maternal working status, parity, paternal education and wealth quintile. An overall improvement in maternal educational attainment was observed between 1996 and 2011. The prevalence of malnutrition although decreasing was consistently high among children of mothers with lower education compared with those of mothers with higher education. In adjusted models incorporating time effects, children of mothers with secondary or higher education were at lower risk of childhood stunting [risk ratio (RR): 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81, 0.89], underweight (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.88) and wasting (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.74, 0.91) compared with children of mothers with no education. We demonstrated the importance of promoting women's education at least up to the secondary level as a means to tackle malnutrition in Bangladesh."

However, some countries show a different trend. Despite continued investment from the government of Ethiopia as well as donors, CGF levels are still high in Ethiopia. This study aimed to assess trends in CGF and associated sociodemographic, economic and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) factors from 2000 to 2016 in Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data were taken from four rounds of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS).

In a cohort study of 12 693 maternal-infant dyads in rural Bangladesh, we examined association and likely explanatory pathways linking HFI, assessed using a validated nine-item perception-based index, to infant size at 6 months. Mothers were assessed early in pregnancy for anthropometric status, dietary diversity and socio-economic status. Infants were assessed for weight, length, and arm, chest and head circumferences and breast and complementary feeding status at birth and 6 months of age. Extent of HFI shared a negative, dose-response association with all measures of infant size at 6 months and odds of wasting and stunting; 57-89 % of variances in the unadjusted models were explained by prenatal factors (maternal nutritional status and dietary diversity), and birth size adjusted for gestational age. Postnatal infant breast and complementary feeding and morbidity exposures explained the remaining fraction of the significant association between HFI and differences in infant arm and chest circumferences and odds of underweight. Contextual (i.e. socio-economic) factors finally brought remaining non-significant fractions of the food insecurity-related mid-infancy growth deficit to practically zero. Improving food security prior to pregnancy and during gestation would likely improve infant growth the most in rural Bangladesh."

In this regard district-representative data were collected in the Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey 2019 for identifying localised disparities. However, district-level estimates of undernutrition indicators - stunting, wasting and underweight - remain largely unexplored. This study aims to estimate district-level prevalence of these indicators as well as to explore their disparities at sub-national (division) and district level spatio-demographic domains cross-classified by children sex, age-groups, and place of residence. Bayesian multilevel models are developed at the sex-age-residence-district level, accounting for cross-sectional, spatial and spatio-demographic variations. The detailed domain-level predictions are aggregated to higher aggregation levels, which results in numerically consistent and reasonable estimates when compared to the design-based direct estimates. Spatio-demographic distributions of undernutrition indicators indicate south-western districts have lower vulnerability to undernutrition than north-eastern districts, and indicate significant inequalities within and between administrative hierarchies, attributable to child age and place of residence. These disparities in undernutrition at both aggregated and disaggregated spatio-demographic domains can aid policymakers in the social inclusion of the most vulnerable to meet the sustainable development goals by 2030."

New approaches are needed to bridge the divide between these communities and to strengthen the overall evidence base for prevention of wasting. To better understand how these different groups perceive and prioritize actions for wasting prevention, key informant interviews (n = 21) were conducted, and an online survey was fielded among nutrition professionals working in low-income countries (n = 107). Additionally, nutrition policy and strategy documents for select global and country institutions (n = 12) were analysed to identify interventions and approaches for addressing different forms of undernutrition. The findings of this study suggest that at both global and country levels, development actors tend to prioritize stunting prevention, and emergency-humanitarian actors tend to prioritize treatment of acute malnutrition. It was less common for wasting prevention to be mentioned as an explicit priority. Many interventions were perceived by respondents to influence both stunting and wasting despite limited published evidence of effectiveness on wasting for water, sanitation and hygiene, growth monitoring and promotion, breastfeeding promotion and micronutrient supplementation. To help unify the nutrition community around prevention of wasting, the discourse about priority interventions should shift from 'stunting versus wasting' and 'prevention versus treatment' to a life-course framing around child survival, growth and development. Respondents identified a need for more programme and research funding that prioritizes both wasting and stunting as outcomes. They also suggest leveraging existing national coordination bodies that bring development and emergency-humanitarian partners together."

            "abstract": "In 2017, diarrheal diseases were responsible for 606 024 deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa. This situation is due to domestic and recreational use of polluted surface waters, deficits in hygiene, access to healthcare and drinking water, and to weak environmental and health monitoring infrastructures. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is an indicator for the enteric pathogens that cause many diarrheal diseases. The links between E. coli, diarrheal diseases and environmental parameters have not received much attention in West Africa, and few studies have assessed health risks by taking into account hazards and socio-health vulnerabilities. This case study, carried out in Burkina Faso (Bagre Reservoir), aims at filling this knowledge gap by analyzing the environmental variables that play a role in the dynamics of E. coli, cases of diarrhea, and by identifying initial vulnerability criteria. A particular focus is given to satellite-derived parameters to assess whether remote sensing can provide a useful tool to assess the health hazard. Samples of surface water were routinely collected to measure E. coli, enterococci and suspended particulate matter (SPM) at a monitoring point (Kapore) during one year. In addition, satellite data were used to estimate precipitation, water level, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and SPM. Monthly epidemiological data for cases of diarrhea from three health centers were also collected and compared with microbiological and environmental data. Finally, semi-structured interviews were carried out to document the use of water resources, contact with elements of the hydrographic network, health behavior and condition, and water and health policy and prevention, in order to identify the initial vulnerability criteria. A positive correlation between E. coli and enterococci in surface waters was found indicating that E. coli is an acceptable indicator of fecal contamination in this region. E. coli and diarrheal diseases were strongly correlated with monsoonal precipitation, in situ SPM, and Near Infra-Red (NIR) band between March and November. Partial least squares regression showed that E. coli concentration was strongly associated with precipitation, Sentinel-2 reflectance in the NIR and SPM, and that the cases of diarrhea were strongly associated with precipitation, NIR, E. coli, SPM, and to a lesser extent with NDVI. Moreover, E. coli dynamics were reproduced using satellite data alone, particularly from February to mid-December (R2 = 0.60) as were cases of diarrhea throughout the year (R2 = 0.76). This implies that satellite data could provide an important contribution to water quality monitoring. Finally, the vulnerability of the population was found to increase during the rainy season due to reduced accessibility to healthcare and drinking water sources and increased use of water of poor quality. During this period, surface water is used because it is close to habitations, easy to use and free from monetary or political constraints. This vulnerability is aggravated by marginality and particularly affects the Fulani, whose concessions are often close to surface water (river, lake) and far from health centers."

A canine zoographic study was conducted, and fresh faecal deposits were collected and analysed for helminth life-cycle stages. The survey indicated that 73% (n = 93) of households in the study area owned one dog or more (mean = 1.4). Resident's attitudes towards canine management suggested that the dog population was, in general, restricted to the residential estate, and most owners claimed to have dewormed their dogs at least as young animals. Of 141 faecal specimens, 58% contained eggs or larvae of one or more of eight helminths: Uncinaria stenocephala (26%), Ancylostoma sp. (23%), Trichuris vulpis (9%), Toxocara canis (8%), Spirocerca lupi (6%), Strongyloides sp. (6%), Apophallus sp. (4%) and taeniids (1%). There was a high level of multiple infection in the host animals, with approximately one fifth of the infected samples containing three or more helminth types. Infection intensity was apparently low, but some dogs harboured heavy worm loads."

            "abstract": "In order to confirm the prevalence of endoparasites fecal samples from 127 hedgehogs living outdoors as well as from 85 in an animal home and from 542 hedgehogs hibernating in private homes were examined. 52.0%-72.3% of the animals from natural surroundings proved to be infested with the lung worm and 72.3%-74.0% with Capillaria species of the intestine, respectively. Capillaria aerophila were found in 15.1%-40.7%, whereas coccidia (1.4%-12.9%) were less frequent. In animal homes and private care hibernating hedgehogs excreted larvae of Crenosoma striatum (23.5% and 21.0%, respectively), eggs of Capillaria species of the intestine (47.1% and 37.1%), and eggs of Capillaria aerophila (7.1% and 19.4%), but oocysts of Isospora rastegaievae were found to be predominant (44.7% and 32.3%). Proglottides of Hymenolepis erinacei and eggs of Brachylaemus erinacei appeared only in the faeces of 3 and 2 hedgehogs, respectively. Helminths of the lung and gut were already found in May, therefore it must be concluded that these parasites are able to survive the winter in the host during the hibernation period. Even young hedgehogs (400-500 g) were infected with Crenosoma and/or Capillaria spp. of the intestine, however, compared with the adults the excretion of eggs and larvae was rather low. The antiparasitic agent Ivermectin (0.3 mg/100 g body-weight) was effective against Crenosoma striatum (efficacy: 95.9%) and Capillaria spp. (100%); therefore it can be recommended as a new, well tolerated anthelmintic against nematodes of the hedgehog."

Additionally, samples were collected from comparable surfaces in the household, and a questionnaire on management and use, combined with a visual inspection of the latrine's design was conducted. In total, 341 latrines were sampled. The MDG classifications \"improved\" vs \"unimproved\" did not describe the observed differences in E. coli concentrations.

Data in the children's files of 31 sub-Saharan African countries were pooled from the Demographic and Health Surveys collected between 2010 and 2019. The outcome variables were three child anthropometrics: stunting (height-for-age z-scores); wasting (weight-for-height z-scores); and underweight (weight-for-age z-scores). The joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on child nutritional status was examined using multilevel regression models. The results were presented as adjusted odds ratios (aORs) at p < 0.05. The percentages of children who were stunted, wasted and underweight in the 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were 31%, 8% and 17%, respectively. On the joint effect of maternal marital status and type of household cooking fuel on stunting, we found that compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel, children born to single mothers who use unclean household cooking fuel, children born to single women who use clean household cooking fuel, and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking were more likely to be stunted. With wasting, children born to single mothers who used unclean household cooking fuel and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking fuel were more likely to be wasted compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel. With underweight, we found that compared to children born to married mothers who used clean household cooking fuel, children born to single mothers who used unclean household cooking fuel, children born to single women who used clean household cooking fuel and children born to married women who used unclean household cooking were more likely to be underweight. It is imperative for the governments of the 31 sub-Saharan African countries to double their efforts to end the use of unclean household cooking fuel. This goal could be achieved by promoting clean household cooking fuel (e.g., electricity, gas, ethanol, solar, etc.) through effective health education, and promotion programmes. The attention of policymakers is drawn to the urgent need for children's nutritional status policies and programmes (e.g., dietary supplementation, increasing dietary diversity, improving agriculture and food security) to be targeted towards at-risk sub-populations (i.e., single mothered households)."

            "abstract": "Adequate nutritional intake for mothers during pregnancy and for children in the first two years of life is known to be crucial for a child's lifelong physical and neurodevelopment. In this regard, the global nutrition community has focused on strategies for improving nutritional intake during the first 1,000 day period. This is largely justified by the observed steep decline in children's height-for-age z scores from birth to 23 months and presumed growth faltering at later ages as a reflection of earlier deprivation that is accumulated and irreversible. Empirical evidence on the age-stratified burden of child undernutrition is needed to re-evaluate the appropriate age for nutrition interventions to target among children. Using data from two successive rounds of National Family Health Surveys conducted in 2006 and 2016, the objective of this paper was to analyze intertemporal changes in the age-stratified burden of child stunting across socioeconomic groups in India. We found that child stunting in India was significantly concentrated among children entering preschool age (24 or above months). Further, the temporal reduction in stunting was relatively higher among children aged 36-47 months compared to younger groups (below 12 and 12-23 months). Greater socioeconomic inequalities persisted in stunting among children from 24 months or above age-groups, and these inequalities have increased over time. Children of preschool age (24 or above months) from economically vulnerable households experienced larger reductions in the prevalence of stunting between 2006 and 2016, suggesting that policy research and strategies beyond the first 1000 days could be critical for accelerating the pace of improvement of child nutrition in India."

The study instrument included determinants of diarrhea such as sociodemographic characteristics, water, sanitation, hygiene practices, gender variables, and behavioral risk factors. Multivariate regression analysis was employed to examine the association between water handling practices and diarrhea. The prevalence of diarrhea is 5%. Female children are more likely to suffer from diarrhea than male children (OR = 2.58; 95% CI: 1.19-5.62).

Female caretakers' behaviors such as daily bathing and seeking medical care at times of illness are protective against diarrhea in children. The findings suggest that diarrhea is a gendered health problem. Female children, who are generally more involved in household activities than male children, are at higher risk of suffering from diarrhea. Female caretakers' personal hygiene, household practices, and perceptions of diarrhea are additional risk factors.

Over 49 million children are wasted; yet globally, there are also 40 million overweight children. Up-to-date data on the magnitude and distribution of micronutrient malnutrition globally and in many countries are lacking. Anemia has been used as a proxy for micronutrient malnutrition; yet anemia, like stunting, has a complex etiology and numerous nonnutritional as well as nutritional causes. Undernutrition, specifically stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiency increasingly coexist with overweight, but accurate data to assess the extent to which these co-exist in countries, households, and individuals and the factors that predict it are scarce. Recent analyses in several countries suggest that there is substantial variability within and among regions in the prevalence and determinants of malnutrition. More and better data that can be used to tailor policies and programs to local contexts are urgently needed if we are to accelerate progress toward addressing malnutrition in all its forms."

            "abstract": "The human coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now a global pandemic. Social distancing, hand hygiene and the use of personal protective equipment dominate the current fight against COVID-19. In developing countries, the need for clean water provision, sanitation and hygiene has only received limited attention. The current perspective examines the latest evidence on the occurrence, persistence and faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent causing COVID-19. Evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 proliferate in the human gastrointestinal system, and is shed via faeces. SARS-CoV-2 can survive and remain viable for up to 6 to 9 days on surfaces. Recent wastewater-based epidemiological studies from several countries also detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewaters. Shell disorder analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 has a rigid outer shell conferring resilience, and a low shell disorder conferring moderate potential for faecal-oral transmission. Taken together, these findings point to potential faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which may partly explain its rapid transmission. Three potential mechanisms may account for SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission: (1) untreated contaminated drinking water, (2) raw and poorly cooked marine and aquatic foods from contaminated sources, (3) raw wastewater-based vegetatble production systems (e.g., salads) and aquaculture, and (4) vector-mediated transmission from faecal sources to foods, particularly those from open markets and street vending. SARS-CoV-2 faecal-oral transmission could be particularly high in developing countries due to several risk factors, including; (1) poor drinking water, wastewater and sanitation infrastructure, (2) poor hygiene and food handling practices, (3) unhygienic and rudimentary funeral practices, including home burials close to drinking water sources, and (4) poor social security and health care systems with low capacity to cope with disease outbreaks. Hence, clean drinking water provision, proper sanitation, food safety and hygiene could be critical in the current fight against COVID-19. Future research directions on COVID-19 faecal-oral transmission are highlighted."

            "abstract": "To assess the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seropositive subjects, fecal samples were collected from 120 HIV-seropositive patients and were analyzed for various intestinal parasites. Thirty-six patients (30%) were found to harbor an intestinal parasite. Cryptosporidium parvum was the most common (10.8%), followed by Giardia lamblia (8.3%). Cyclospora cayetanensis and Blastocystis hominis each were detected in 3.3% of the patients, while Isospora belli and Enterocytozoon bieneusi were each detected in 2.5% of the patients. The other parasites observed were Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar in two cases and hookworm ova in one patient. Of the 36 patients who tested positive for intestinal parasites, 27 (75%) had diarrhea. The most common parasite, which was associated with diarrhea, was C. parvum. The present study highlights the importance of testing for intestinal parasites in patients who are HIV-positive, and emphasizes the necessity of increasing awareness among clinicians regarding the occurrence of these parasites in this population."

Clustering sampling was used to collect data from 8,000 families in Ceará, Northeastern Brazil, for the years 1987 and 2007. Acute undernutrition was calculated as weight/age < -2 standard deviation (SD); stunting as height/age < -2 SD; wasting as weight/height < -2 SD.

Prevalence of wasting changed little in the period. In 1987, socioeconomic and biological characteristics (family income, mother's education, toilet and tap water availability, children's medical consultation and hospitalization, age, sex and birth weight) were significantly associated with undernutrition, stunting and wasting.

The study provides powerful confirmation of the importance of environmental factors on diarrhea: The effects of water quality, household sanitation, and community sanitation are strong, consistent, and statistically significant. The positive impact of improved water quality is greatest for families living under good sanitary conditions, with the effect statistically significant when sanitation is measured at the community level but not significant when sanitation is measured at the household level. Improving drinking water quality would have no effect in neighborhoods with very poor environmental sanitation; however, in areas with better community sanitation, reducing the concentration of fecal coliforms by two orders of magnitude would lead to a 40 percent reduction in diarrhea. Providing private excreta disposal would be expected to reduce diarrhea by 42 percent, while eliminating excreta around the house would lead to a 30 percent reduction in diarrhea. The findings suggest that improvements in both water supply and sanitation are necessary if infant health in developing countries is to be improved. They also imply that it is not epidemiologic but behavioral, institutional, and economic factors that should correctly determine the priority of interventions."

            "abstract": "Child feces represent a particular health risk to children due to increased prevalence of enteric agents and a higher risk of exposure owing to exploratory behaviors of young children. The safe management of such feces presents a significant challenge, not only for the 2.4 billion who lack access to improved sanitation, but also due to unhygienic feces collection and disposal and poor subsequent handwashing practices. We assessed potential sources of fecal exposure by documenting child feces management practices in a cross-sectional study of 851 children < 5 years of age from 694 households in 42 slums in two cities in Odisha, India. No preambulatory children and only 27.4% of ambulatory children defecated directly in the latrine. Children that did not defecate in a latrine mainly defecated on the ground, whether they were preambulatory or ambulatory. Use of diapers (1.2%) or potties (2.8%) was low. If the feces were removed from the ground, the defecation area was usually cleaned, if at all, only with water. Most children's feces were disposed of in surrounding environment, with only 6.5% deposited into any kind of latrine, including unimproved. Handwashing with soap of the caregiver after child feces disposal and child anal cleaning with soap after defecation was also uncommon. While proper disposal of child feces in an improved latrine still represents a major challenge, control of the risks presented requires attention to the full range of exposures associated to the management of child feces, and not simply the place of disposal."

A total of 360 randomly selected children, aged 8-15 years, had complete baseline and end-line survey data. Mixed regression models were used to assess the impact of the interventions, controlling for baseline characteristics. The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections decreased both in intervention and control schools, but the decrease was significantly higher in the intervention schools related to the control schools (odds ratio [OR] of the intervention effect = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-0.5). Indices of undernutrition did not decrease at end-line in intervention schools.

Parameters of water quality remained unchanged. A combination of agricultural, nutritional, and WASH-related interventions embedded in the social-ecological systems and delivered through the school platform improved several child health outcomes, including intestinal parasitic infections and some WASH-related behaviors. Sustained interventions with stronger household and community-based components are, however, needed to improve school children's health in the long-term."

Compared with adult mothers, adolescent mothers were shorter (-1·21 cm, 95% CI -1·78 to -0·65), more likely to be underweight (18 percentage points, 15-21) and anaemic (8 percentage points, 6-11), less likely to access health services (-4 to -15 percentage points), and had poorer complementary feeding practices (-3 to -9 percentage points). Adolescent mothers also had less education (-3·30 years, 95% CI -3·68 to -2·91), less bargaining power (-7 to -15 percentage points), and lived in poorer households (-0·66 SD, 96% CI -0·82 to -0·50) with poorer sanitation (-28 percentage points, -32 to -24). In the path analysis, these intermediate factors predicted child anthropometry, with the strongest links being mother's education (18%), socioeconomic status (13%), and weight (15%).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Children born to adolescent mothers are at risk of being undernourished. Adolescent pregnancy is related to child undernutrition through poor maternal nutritional status, lower education, less health service access, poor complementary feeding practices, and poor living conditions. Policies and programmes to delay pregnancy and promote women's rights could help break the intergenerational cycle of undernutrition through many routes.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through Partnerships and Opportunities to Strengthen and Harmonize Actions for Nutrition in India, led by the International Food Policy Research Institute."

            "abstract": "Biofilms in surface waters primarily consist of allochthonous microorganisms. Under conditions of pollution faecally derived bacteria may interact with these biofilms. Total coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci are used to monitor source water quality, indicating faecal pollution and the possible presence of enteric pathogens. In the present study the occurrence of faecal indicators was investigated in biofilms (epilithic biofilms, sediments) of German rivers. All of the biofilms contained significant concentrations of these bacteria, which were several orders of magnitude lower compared with the total cell number and the number of culturable heterotrophic plate count bacteria indicating that faecal indicator bacteria represented a minor fraction of the whole biofilm communities. The biofilms displayed approximately two orders of magnitude higher concentrations of total coliforms, E. coli and enterococci compared with the overlying water. Identification of coliform and enterococcal isolates from the biofilms revealed the presence of species which are known to be opportunistic pathogens. Overall, the results of the present study show that faecal indicator bacteria can survive in the presence of high cell densities of the authochthonous microflora in epilithic biofilms and sediments, suggesting that these biofilms may act as a reservoir for bacterial pathogens in polluted rivers."

            "abstract": "Nutrition support programs that only focus upon better complementary feeding remain an insufficient means of limiting growth faltering in vulnerable populations of children. To determine if symptoms of acute infections correlate with the incidence of growth faltering in rural Malawian children, the associations between fever, diarrhea, and cough with anthropometric measures of stunting, wasting, and underweight were investigated. Data were analyzed from a trial where 209 children were provided with adequate complementary food and followed fortnightly from 6-18 months of age. Linear mixed model analysis was used to test for associations. Diarrheal disease was inversely associated with changes in height-for-age Z-score (HAZ), mid-upper arm circumference Z-score (MUACZ), and weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ). Fever was also inversely associated with changes in MUACZ and WAZ. These results suggest that initiatives to reduce febrile and diarrheal diseases are needed in conjunction with improved complementary feeding to limit growth faltering in rural Malawi."

This study analyses child undernutrition among urban poor and non-poor and decomposes the contribution of various factors influencing socio-economic inequality. This paper uses data from two recent rounds of National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3&4) conducted during 2005-06 and 2015-16.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The concentration index (CI) and the concentration curve (CC) measure socio-economic inequality in child growth in terms of stunting, wasting, and underweight. Wagstaff decomposition further analyses key contributors in CI by segregating significant covariates into five groups-mother's factor, health-seeking factors, environmental factors, child factors, and socio-economic factors.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of child undernutrition was more pronounced among children from poor socio-economic strata. The concentration index decreased for stunting (- 0.186 to - 0.156), underweight (- 0.213 to - 0.162) and wasting (- 0.116 to - 0.045) from 2005 to 06 to 2015-16 respectively. The steepness in growth was more among urban poor than among urban non-poor in every age interval. Maternal education contributed about 19%, 29%, and 33% to the inequality in stunting, underweight and wasting, respectively during 2005-06. During 2005-06 as well as 2015-16, maternal factors (specifically mother's education) were the highest contributory factors in explaining rich-poor inequality in stunting as well as underweight. More than 85% of the economic inequality in stunting, underweight, and wasting among urban children were explained by maternal factors, environmental factors, and health-seeking factors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      All the nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions in urban areas should be prioritized, focusing on urban poor, who are often clustered in low-income slums. Rich-poor inequality in child growth calls out for integration and convergence of nutrition interventions with policy interventions aimed at poverty reduction. There is also a need to expand the scope of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program to provide mass education regarding nutrition and health by making provisions of home visits of workers primarily focusing on pregnant and lactating mothers."

The study revealed that the level of knowledge about waterborne diseases was relatively high (76.7 ± 1.75%), but knowledge on transmission routes was inadequate. The majority of the respondents had no knowledge when it comes to water-based diseases and their prevention (78.4 ± 1.71%).The attitude and practice on hygiene was also found to be high (91.40 ± 1.16%). Some schools from the urban area had proper handwashing facilities, but there was no soap available. The borehole water quality for rural schools appeared clear, but the microbial quality was unknown. The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate in rural schools, with no handwashing areas and no sanitary bins for girls. Some schools had toilets with broken doors which did not offer privacy. The only water tap, located at the centre of the school premises, was not enough for the whole school community."

Understanding shared and separate correlates may inform interventions. We aimed to assess the spatial codistribution of wasting, stunting and underweight and investigate their shared correlates among children aged 6-59 months in Somalia.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Cross-sectional nutritional assessments surveys were conducted using structured interviews among communities in Somalia biannually from 2007 to 2010.

Access to foods with high protein content and vegetation cover, a proxy of rainfall or drought, were associated with lower risk of wasting and stunting. Age, gender, illness, access to carbohydrates and temperature were correlates of all three indicators. The spatial codistribution was highest between stunting and underweight with relative risk values ranging between 0.15 and 6.20, followed by wasting and underweight (range: 0.18-5.18) and lowest between wasting and stunting (range: 0.26-4.32).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The determinants of wasting and stunting are largely shared, but their correlation is relatively variable in space.

Infants born at the start of the annual wet season (July-October) showed early growth faltering in weight-for-length z score, putting them at increased risk of subsequent stunting. Using time-lagged observations, being wasted was predictive of stunting (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.7, 3.9), even after accounting for current stunting. Boys were more likely to be wasted, stunted, and concurrently wasted and stunted than girls, as well as being more susceptible to seasonally driven growth deficits.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We provide evidence that stunting is in part a biological response to previous episodes of being wasted. This finding suggests that stunting may represent a deleterious form of adaptation to more overt undernutrition (wasting). This is important from a policy perspective as it suggests we are failing to recognize the importance of wasting simply because it tends to be more acute and treatable. These data suggest that stunted children are not just short children but are children who earlier were more seriously malnourished and who are survivors of a composite process."

The WHO standards were used to calculate Z-scores of height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ) and BMI-for-age (BMIZ).\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Fifty counties of thirteen mid-western provinces, China.\n    \n\n\n          Subjects:\n        \n      \n      A total 8041 children aged <5 years were measured during a 2-month period from August to October 2006.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of stunting, underweight and wasting were 30.2 %, 10.2 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The prevalence of overweight and the possible risk of overweight were as high as 4.1 % and 16.8 %. Further analysis among the children with possible risk of overweight found that the percentage of stunting (HAZ < or-2) was 57.6 %, the percentage with -2 <or= HAZ <or= 2 was 41.0 % and the percentage with HAZ > 2 was only 1.4 %. The prevalence of stunting was 21.9 % and of underweight was 12.7 % by the NCHS reference.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Stunting was the most serious problem that was impeding child growth and development. The high rate of 'overweight' was a false impression, the truth being 'stunting overweight', and the way to solve it should be to increase protein and other nutrients in the diet at an early age."

We describe here the epidemiology of infection with Giardia in the first 2 years of life in the Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development Project (MAL-ED), a multisite birth-cohort study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods.:\n        \n      \n      From 2089 children, 34916 stool samples collected during monthly surveillance and episodes of diarrhea were tested for Giardia using an enzyme immunoassay. We quantified the risk of Giardia detection, identified risk factors, and assessed the associations with micronutrients, markers of gut inflammation and permeability, diarrhea, and growth using multivariable linear regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results.:\n        \n      \n      The incidence of at least 1 Giardia detection varied according to site (range, 37.7%-96.4%) and was higher in the second year of life. Exclusive breastfeeding (HR for first Giardia detection in a monthly surveillance stool sample, 0.46 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.75]), higher socioeconomic status (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.97]), and recent metronidazole treatment (risk ratio for any surveillance stool detection, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.84]) were protective. Persistence of Giardia (consecutive detections) in the first 6 months of life was associated with reduced subsequent diarrheal rates in Naushahro Feroze, Pakistan but not at any other site. Giardia detection was also associated with an increased lactulose/mannitol ratio. Persistence of Giardia before 6 months of age was associated with a -0.29 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.05) deficit in weight-for-age z score and -0.29 (95% CI, -0.64 to 0.07) deficit in length-for-age z score at 2 years.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions.:\n        \n      \n      Infection with Giardia occurred across epidemiological contexts, and repeated detections in 40% of the children suggest that persistent infections were common. Early persistent infection with Giardia, independent of diarrhea, might contribute to intestinal permeability and stunted growth."

As mobility increases, this time period also coincides with first exposure to soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in tropical and sub-tropical environments. The association between malnutrition and STH infection, however, has been understudied in this vulnerable age group.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology/principal findings:\n        \n      \n      A nested cross-sectional survey was conducted in 12 and 13-month old children participating in a deworming trial in Iquitos, an STH-endemic area of the Peruvian Amazon. An extensive socio-demo-epi questionnaire was administered to the child's parent. Length and weight were measured, and the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development were administered to measure cognition, language, and fine motor development. Stool specimens were collected to determine the presence of STH. The association between malnutrition (i.e. stunting and underweight) and STH infection, and other child, maternal, and household characteristics, was analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression. A total of 1760 children were recruited between September 2011 and June 2012. Baseline data showed a prevalence of stunting and underweight of 24.2% and 8.6%, respectively. In a subgroup of 880 randomly-allocated children whose specimens were analyzed by the Kato-Katz method, the prevalence of any STH infection was 14.5%. Risk factors for stunting in these 880 children included infection with at least one STH species (aRR = 1.37; 95% CI 1.01, 1.86) and a lower development score (aRR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95, 0.99).

            "abstract": "Although wasting marmoset syndrome (WMS) is one of the biggest problems facing captive marmoset colonies, the mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis remain unclear. In our clinical experience, it is difficult to cure WMS-affected marmosets with severe hypoalbuminemia. Thus, the mechanisms underlying hypoalbuminemia in WMS must be understood. In the present study, we investigated whether intestinal protein loss, a known reason for hypoalbuminemia, occurs in this disease. Fecal α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI, also known as α1-antitrypsin) has been used to diagnose intestinal protein loss in other species. To develop an assay system for this protein, marmoset α1-PI was purified from plasma and antibodies against it were developed using the purified protein. Using the antibodies, a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure marmoset α1-PI was developed, and its detection sensitivity for fecal samples was ∼20-fold higher than that of a commercial kit for human α1-PI. From this ELISA, the reference intervals for serum and feces of healthy marmosets were 0.87-1.85 mg/ml and 0.53-395.58 μg/g, respectively. The average concentrations of α1-PI in serum and feces of seven WMS-affected marmosets were 1.17 mg/ml and 1357.58 μg/g, respectively. Although there were no significant differences in the serum concentrations between healthy and WMS-affected marmosets, the fecal concentrations were significantly higher in WMS-affected marmosets than in healthy individuals, suggesting that intestinal protein loss occurs in WMS. Intestinal protein loss of WMS-affected marmosets was significantly attenuated with treatment, suggesting that it is one of the mechanisms involved in the hypoalbuminemia observed in WMS."

These treatments are being promoted as \"rapid impact interventions\". However, if helminth infections cause underweight, stunting, anaemia, and impaired mental development in children, how will removing worms alone lead to recovery without treating the underlying deficits that have been caused or made worse by helminth disease? Energy, protein, and micronutrients are required by children who are underweight or who have stunted growth; children who are anaemic will require iron and other micronutrients for haemopoiesis; and children who have lost education will need remedial teaching. Treating neglected worm diseases is an essential first step to good health, but anthelmintic drugs need to be integrated with simple and inexpensive nutritional interventions such as micronutrient supplements to promote recovery and have a rapid effect."

The aim of this study was to examine the factors influencing the nutritional status and care practices of children left behind. A sample of 321 children, 6-59 months old of international migrant workers from a cross-sectional nationally represented study were included. Care practices were assessed using ten caregiving behaviours on personal hygiene, feeding, and use of health services. Results revealed the prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight to be 11.6, 18.2 and 24.0 percent, respectively. Father being a migrant worker has a positive effect on childcare practices and birthweight of the child. This study indicates that undernutrition remains a major concern, particularly in the poorest households where the mother is a migrant worker, also each additional 100 g increase in the birthweight of a child in a migrant household, decreases the probability of being wasted, stunted and underweight by 6%, 8% and 23% respectively. In depth study is needed to understand how labour migration affects household level outcomes related to child nutrition and childcare in order to build skills and capacities of migrant families."

There was no difference in weight gain velocity or WHZ by admissions criteria (WHZ and/or MUAC). Underweight and concurrently wasted/stunted children had lower MUAC and WHZ at 8 weeks compared with those who were not underweight or concurrently wasted and stunted. Children with both low MUAC and low WHZ had the worst outcomes. Relying on MUAC alone may miss children who have poor outcomes.

This may be in part due to suboptimal project fidelity or adherence. As part of a matched-control trial of a comprehensive school-based WASH project in Mali, we measured the degree to which schools met four prespecified WASH targets, comprised of 15 criteria, 0-3 years after program implementation. We compared achievement of the targets and criteria between beneficiary and matched control schools, and compared achievement within beneficiary schools at baseline and at follow-up visits. We assessed the \"as-treated\" associations between WASH target achievement and pupil diarrhea, respiratory symptoms, and absence. Between 44% and 81% of beneficiary schools achieved each target. Although adherence was inconsistent across schools, beneficiary schools, on average, met more WASH targets than matched control schools, and beneficiary schools also met more WASH targets at follow-up than at baseline. Very few of the targets were individually associated with health and absenteeism outcomes. Increasing achievement of multiple WASH targets together was associated with a lower odds of pupils having diarrhea (P trend < 0.01) and having respiratory symptoms (P trend < 0.01), but was not associated with roll-call absence (P trend = 0.14) or pupil-reported absence (P trend = 0.41). These results indicate that a comprehensive WASH intervention and a focus on increasing adherence may help maximize the health effects of school WASH programs, but that WASH alone might not be sufficient to decrease pupils' absenteeism."

Piped water access was associated with lower odds of A. lumbricoides (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.39-0.41) and T. trichiura infection (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.72), but not any STH infection (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.28-3.11). Access to sanitation was associated with decreased likelihood of infection with any STH (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.76), T. trichiura (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.74), and A. lumbricoides (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.44-0.88), but not with hookworm infection (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61-1.06). Wearing shoes was associated with reduced odds of hookworm infection (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.18-0.47) and infection with any STH (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.11-0.83). Handwashing, both before eating (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.26-0.55) and after defecating (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.58), was associated with lower odds of A. lumbricoides infection. Soap use or availability was significantly associated with lower infection with any STH (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.98), as was handwashing after defecation (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.24-0.90). Observational evidence constituted the majority of included literature, which limits any attempt to make causal inferences. Due to underlying heterogeneity across observational studies, the meta-analysis results reflect an average of many potentially distinct effects, not an average of one specific exposure-outcome relationship.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      WASH access and practices are generally associated with reduced odds of STH infection. Pooled estimates from all meta-analyses, except for two, indicated at least a 33% reduction in odds of infection associated with individual WASH practices or access. Although most WASH interventions for STH have focused on sanitation, access to water and hygiene also appear to significantly reduce odds of infection. Overall quality of evidence was low due to the preponderance of observational studies, though recent randomized controlled trials have further underscored the benefit of handwashing interventions. Limited use of the Joint Monitoring Program's standardized water and sanitation definitions in the literature restricted efforts to generalize across studies. While further research is warranted to determine the magnitude of benefit from WASH interventions for STH control, these results call for multi-sectoral, integrated intervention packages that are tailored to social-ecological contexts."

A total of 281 children aged 2 - 15 years were studied. The data were collected using structured questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and laboratory analysis for blood and faecal samples. All children were infected either by A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura or hookworm and almost 19%, 26% and 3% of the children had severe infection of ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm infection respectively. The prevalence of giardiasis among them was 24.9%. Overall, 41.5% of the children were anaemic (haemoglobin < 11.0 g/dL). Of these 61.0% of the children had iron deficiency and 36.5% had iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), which accounted for 88.0% of anaemia in this population. Severe trichuriasis had the most significant correlation with anaemia and iron deficiency in this population. It contributed to low concentrations of haemoglobin, serum iron and serum ferritin and high total iron binding capacity (TIBC). Significant underweight and stunting were associated with low concentrations of haemoglobin and serum iron while significant wasting was significantly associated with low concentration of serum ferritin. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that severe trichuriasis was a strong predictor of IDA. It also confirmed that children who were significantly underweight and whose mother was working were independent predictors of IDA in this population."

            "abstract": "Childhood stunting remains a public health burden worldwide. Although many studies have examined early life and in-utero risk factors; most have been observational and have used analytic techniques that make inferences limited to population means, thereby obscuring important within-group variations. This study addressed that important gap. Using data from a birth cohort of Ugandan infants (n = 4528), we applied group-based trajectory modelling to assess diverse patterns of growth among children from birth to 1-year old. A multinomial regression model was conducted to understand the relationship between risk factors and observed patterns across groups. We found that the onset of stunting occurred before birth and followed four distinct growth patterns: chronically stunted (Group 1), recovery (Group 2), borderline stunted (Group 3) and normal (Group 4). The average length-for-age z-score (LAZ) at birth was -2.6, -3.9, -0.6 and 0.5 for Groups 1-4, respectively. Although both Groups 1 and 2 were stunted at birth, stunting persisted in Group 1 while children in Group 2 recovered by the fourth month. Group 3 exhibited mild stunting while Group 4 was normal. Wasting and underweight were observed in all groups, with the highest prevalence of underweight in Group 1. Wasting gradually increased among children born already stunted (Groups 1 and 2). This showed the importance of distinguishing children by their growth patterns rather than aggregating them and only comparing population averages against global growth standards. The design of nutrition interventions should consider the differential factors and potential for growth gains relative to different risks within each group."

Essential FA did not differ between stunted and non-stunted children and was not associated with height-for-age z-score or weight-for-age z-score. Similarly, no relationships between other blood fatty acids and growth parameters were observed in this population.

Together the trials enrolled >19,000 women during pregnancy and measured >15,000 of their children at 18 months (SHINE) or 24 months (WASH Benefits trials) of age. Throughout the 3 trials, the IYCF intervention increased mean length-for-age Z-score by 0.13-0.26. None of the WASH interventions had any effect on linear growth among any of the study populations. This lack of effect is most likely because the household-level elementary WASH interventions employed in the trials were not effective enough in reducing enteropathogen exposure to facilitate linear growth.

Pigs displaying PMWS-like signs and matched healthy cohorts were euthanized during the clinical outbreak. PMWS was diagnosed according to internationally accepted criteria and pigs were classified as: (i) PMWS cases, (ii) wasted non-PMWS cases and (iii) healthy pigs. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) quantitative PCR (qPCR) and serology techniques were applied to analyse longitudinally collected sera and/or nasal and rectal swabs. Results showed that PCV2 load increased in parallel to waning maternal antibody levels, reaching the maximum viral load concurrent with development of clinical signs. PMWS affected pigs had higher PCV2 prevalence and/or viral load than healthy pigs in all collected samples at necropsy (p<0.0001-0.05) and even in sera and nasal swabs at the sampling prior to PMWS outbreak (p<0.01-0.05). Danish farms had a higher PCV2 prevalence in young piglets as well as an earlier PMWS presentation compared to Spanish farms. PMWS diagnoses were confirmed by laboratory tests in only half of pigs clinically suspected to suffer from PMWS. Positive and significant correlations were found among PCV2 viral loads present in sera, nasal swabs, rectal swabs and lymphoid tissues (R=0.289-0.827, p<0.0001-0.01), which indicates that nasal and rectal swabs were suitable indicators of PCV2 excretion. Sensitivity and/or specificity values observed from both tests used separately or combined suggested that qPCR and/or serology tests are not apparently able to substitute histopathology plus detection of PCV2 in tissues for the individual PMWS diagnosis within PMWS affected farms.

Data were extracted from these studies and pooled by meta-analysis to provide summary estimates of the effectiveness of each type of intervention. All of the interventions studied were found to reduce significantly the risks of diarrhoeal illness. Most of the interventions had a similar degree of impact on diarrhoeal illness, with the relative risk estimates from the overall meta-analyses ranging between 0.63 and 0.75. The results generally agree with those from previous reviews, but water quality interventions (point-of-use water treatment) were found to be more effective than previously thought, and multiple interventions (consisting of combined water, sanitation, and hygiene measures) were not more effective than interventions with a single focus.

We addressed different themes, including maternal and newborn characteristics, immunology and endocrinology, evolutionary biology, care practices, and anthropometric indices to explore potential sources of sex differences in child undernutrition. Our review found that the evidence on why sex differences occur is limited but that a complex interaction of social, environmental, and genetic factors likely underlies these differences throughout the life cycle. Despite their bigger size at birth and during infancy, in conditions of food deprivation, boys experience more undernutrition from as early as the foetal period. Differences appear to be more pronounced in more severe presentations of undernutrition and in more socioeconomically deprived contexts. Boys are more vulnerable to infectious disease, and differing immune and endocrine systems appear to explain some of this disadvantage. Limited evidence also suggests that different sociological factors and care practices might exert influence and have the potential to exacerbate or reverse observed differences. Further research is needed to better understand sex differences in undernutrition and the implications of these for child outcomes and prevention and treatment programming."

World Health Organization motor developmental milestones and vowel and consonant counts were assessed. Longitudinal regression models were applied to assess the association of anthropometric, dietary intake, infectious disease morbidity and socio-economic and demographic factors on developmental outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, 9.4% were stunted or length-for-age Z score < -2, and 30.2% were mild-to-moderately stunted or length-for-age Z score < -1. Stunting status was significantly associated with motor and phonetic language acquisition at each time point during infancy. Several nutrition factors significantly predicted earlier achievement of motor and language development outcomes in longitudinal models: child anthropometry; breastfeeding and complementary feeding frequencies; dietary diversity; egg and oil intake; and reduced infectious disease morbidities. Increases in the length-for-age Z score significantly predicted all motor and language outcomes and yielded the best fit models compared to other anthropometric indicators (p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Child development interventions may be enhanced by incorporating nutrition strategies such as improved diet quality, breastfeeding promotion and diarrhoeal disease mitigation."

            "abstract": "A questionnaire and observational study was conducted to determine the problems associated with construction, design and hygiene methods used to maintain pit latrines in a high-density urban township in Malawi. The survey comprised 100 randomly selected households and the person responsible for the latrine maintenance was interviewed. Eighty-seven percent of householders used traditional latrines, 67% with earthen and 20% with concrete (i.e. sanitation platform, also known as San-plats) floors. A variety of makeshift squat-hole covers (e.g. iron sheets, rocks, cardboard) are used by those who cannot afford San-plats to reduce fly and odour problems. Most squat-hole covers were fouled with faecal matter and some presented risk of invasive injury due to sharp edges. Five households used ventilated improved latrines whilst the remaining eight per cent made use of their neighbour's latrine. Ownership of property, poverty and theft in the area significantly influenced the type and structural condition of the latrine. Walls, ceilings and doors of the superstructure comprised a mixture of miscellaneous materials (i.e. cardboard, paper, cloth, brick) making the hygienic upkeep of the latrine difficult. Cloth doors were often used for hand drying. Geographical location, such as rocky terrain with inadequate soil consolidation, and environmental conditions, such as heavy rains and floods, exacerbate structural defects. Coupled with the lack of attention afforded to the disposal of young children's faeces, wash-water and pit surcharging, the potential exists for widespread contamination of the surrounding environment and transmission of faecal-oral disease. More than half of the respondents stressed that they had not received any information regarding health education and hygienic maintenance of the latrine. As such, there is need for a hygiene education programme to promote awareness of appropriate sanitation and behavioural change. Cultural and religious factors were found not to influence latrine use."

Mothers receiving antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) may adopt better IYCF. This study examined the association of ANC or PNC attendance with IYCF and child nutrition status. Methods A cross-sectional study was performed on 400 mother-child pairs in rural Nepal. Mothers were interviewed about their history of ANC and PNC attendance and IYCF; the height and weight of their children were measured. IYCF was measured with infant and child feeding index (ICFI) aggregating scores of dietary diversity, meal frequency, continued breastfeeding, and dietary variety. Lower ICFI scores indicated poorer IYCF practices. Multiple regression and logistic regression examined the association of ANC and PNC attendance with ICFI scores and undernutrition, respectively. Results Absence of ANC (β = -1.01, P = 0.011) and absence of PNC (β = -1.01, P = 0.011) were negatively associated with ICFI scores. Additionally, absence of ANC was positively associated with underweight (AOR 3.37; 95 % CI 1.42-9.92 for children 6-11 months, AOR 3.43; 95 % CI 1.41-8.32 for children 12-23 months) and stunting (AOR 6.51; 95 % CI 2.11-20.10 for children 6-11 months, AOR 3.32; 95 % CI 1.50-7.31 for children 12-23 months).

However, there are no previously published randomized trials to measure the health impacts of large-scale sanitation programs. India's Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) is one such program that seeks to end the practice of open defecation by changing social norms and behaviors, and providing technical support and financial subsidies. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of the TSC implemented with capacity building support from the World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program in Madhya Pradesh on availability of individual household latrines (IHLs), defecation behaviors, and child health (diarrhea, highly credible gastrointestinal illness [HCGI], parasitic infections, anemia, growth).\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled trial in 80 rural villages.

The study enrolled a random sample of 5,209 children <5 years old from 3,039 households that had at least one child <24 months at the beginning of the study. A random subsample of 1,150 children <24 months at enrollment were tested for soil transmitted helminth and protozoan infections in stool.

The intervention increased percentage of households in a village with improved sanitation facilities as defined by the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme by an average of 19% (95% CI for difference: 12%-26%; group means: 22% control versus 41% intervention), decreased open defecation among adults by an average of 10% (95% CI for difference: 4%-15%; group means: 73% intervention versus 84% control). However, the intervention did not improve child health measured in terms of multiple health outcomes (diarrhea, HCGI, helminth infections, anemia, growth). Limitations of the study included a relatively short follow-up period following implementation, evidence for contamination in ten of the 40 control villages, and bias possible in self-reported outcomes for diarrhea, HCGI, and open defecation behaviors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The intervention led to modest increases in availability of IHLs and even more modest reductions in open defecation.

This study assessed human fecal contamination and pathogen exposures in rural India, and the effect of increased sanitation coverage on contamination and exposure rates. In a cross-sectional study of 60 villages of a cluster-randomized controlled sanitation trial in Odisha, India, human and domestic animal fecal contamination was measured in community tubewells and ponds (n = 301) and via exposure pathways in homes (n = 354), using Bacteroidales microbial source tracking fecal markers validated in India. Community water sources were further tested for diarrheal pathogens (rotavirus, adenovirus and Vibrio cholerae by quantitative PCR; pathogenic Escherichia coli by multiplex PCR; Cryptosporidium and Giardia by immunomagnetic separation and direct fluorescent antibody microscopy). Exposure pathways in intervention and control villages were compared and relationships with child diarrhea examined. Human fecal markers were rarely detected in tubewells (2.4%, 95%CI: 0.3-4.5%) and ponds (5.6%, 95%CI: 0.8-10.3%), compared to homes (35.4%, 95%CI: 30.4-40.4%). In tubewells, V. cholerae was the most frequently detected pathogen (19.8%, 95%CI: 14.4-25.2%), followed by Giardia (14.8%, 95%CI: 10.0-19.7%). In ponds, Giardia was most often detected (74.5%, 95%CI: 65.7-83.3%), followed by pathogenic E. coli (48.1%, 95%CI: 34.8-61.5%) and rotavirus (44.4%, 95%CI: 34.2-54.7%). At village-level, prevalence of fecal pathogen detection in community drinking water sources was associated with elevated prevalence of child diarrhea within 6 weeks of testing (RR 2.13, 95%CI: 1.25-3.63) while within homes, higher levels of human and animal fecal marker detection were associated with increased risks of subsequent child diarrhea (P = 0.044 and 0.013, respectively). There was no evidence that the intervention, which increased functional latrine coverage and use by 27 percentage points, reduced human fecal contamination in any tested pathway, nor the prevalence of pathogens in water sources. In conclusion, the study demonstrates that (1) improved sanitation alone may be insufficient and further interventions needed in the domestic domain to reduce widespread human and animal fecal contamination observed in homes, (2) pathogens detected in tubewells indicate these sources are microbiologically unsafe for drinking and were associated with child diarrhea, (3) domestic use of ponds heavily contaminated with multiple pathogens presents an under-recognized health risk, and (4) a 27 percentage point increase in improved sanitation access at village-level did not reduce detectable human fecal and pathogen contamination in this setting."

            "abstract": "In 2014, the Emergency Nutrition Network published a report on the relationship between wasting and stunting. We aim to review evidence generated since that review to better understand the implications for improving child nutrition, health and survival. We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines, registered with PROSPERO. We identified search terms that describe wasting and stunting and the relationship between the two. We included studies related to children under five from low- and middle-income countries that assessed both ponderal growth/wasting and linear growth/stunting and the association between the two. We included 45 studies. The review found the peak incidence of both wasting and stunting is between birth and 3 months. There is a strong association between the two conditions whereby episodes of wasting contribute to stunting and, to a lesser extent, stunting leads to wasting. Children with multiple anthropometric deficits, including concurrent stunting and wasting, have the highest risk of near-term mortality when compared with children with any one deficit alone. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the use of mid-upper-arm circumference combined with weight-for-age Z score might effectively identify children at most risk of near-term mortality. Wasting and stunting, driven by common factors, frequently occur in the same child, either simultaneously or at different moments through their life course. Evidence of a process of accumulation of nutritional deficits and increased risk of mortality over a child's life demonstrates the pressing need for integrated policy, financing and programmatic approaches to the prevention and treatment of child malnutrition."

            "abstract": "We assessed the prevalence of intestinal parasites among 268 2-12-year-old children living in rural areas, small villages, and semi-urban areas of the Chaco region, south-eastern Bolivia. The overall parasitism was 69%. Only protozoa, helminths, or co-infections were observed in 89.2%, 5.9%, or 4.9% of the positive children, respectively. A significant progressive increase in overall parasite prevalence was found when passing from rural areas to small villages and semi-urban areas. The most commonly found species were Entamoeba coli (38.4%), Giardia intestinalis (37.7%), and Blastocystis spp. (16%). Hymenolepis nana was the most prevalent helminth (5.6%), followed by Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworms (1.5% and 0.4%) evidenced only in rural areas and in villages. Molecular diagnostics identified Blastocystis subtypes 9 and 2, and 5 infections by Entamoeba histolytica and 4 by Entamoeba dispar. The dramatic decrease in prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths with respect to that observed about 20 years ago (> 40%) evidences the success of the preventive chemotherapy intervention implemented in 1986. Health education and improved sanitation should be intensified to control protozoan infections."

There has been little attention to within-country trend analyses. This paper presents child undernutrition trend analyses from 1993 to 2008-09, using the 2006 WHO criteria for undernutrition. The analyses are decomposed by child's sex and age, and by maternal education level, household Wealth Index, and province, to reveal any departures from the overall national trends.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study uses the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey data collected from women aged 15-49 years and children aged 0-35 months in 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008-09.

The role of access to WASH facilities on child growth outcomes in Ethiopia is largely unknown. The aim of this study was to determine individual and combined effects of access to WASH facilities on child growth outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data for this analysis was sourced from the recent Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016. A multivariable logistic regression model was applied to identify the separate and combined association of access to WASH facilities with child growth outcomes.

Statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Included in the analyses were data for children 0-59 months of age, which amounted to valid data for 9588 children with a height-for-age z-score (HAZ), 9752 children with a weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) and 9607 children with a weight-for-height z-score (WHZ). Children with access to improved combined sanitation with handwashing facilities had 29% lower odds of linear growth failure (stunting) (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51-0.99) compared with those with unimproved. Children with access to combined improved WASH facilities were 33% less likely to have linear growth failure (AOR = 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45-0.98). Access to improved handwashing alone reduced the odds of being underweight by 17% (AOR = 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.98) compared with unimproved.

Poor maternal dietary diversity during pregnancy has been linked with increased risk of fetal growth failure and adverse birth outcomes but may also influence subsequent infant growth. Our aim is to assess the role of prenatal maternal dietary diversity in infant growth in rural Uganda. Data from 3291 women and infant pairs enrolled in a birth cohort from 2014 to 2016 were analysed (NCT04233944). Maternal diets were assessed using dietary recall in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. Maternal dietary diversity scores (DDS) were calculated using the FAO Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W). Cox regression models were used to evaluate associations of the DDS with the incidence of underweight, stunting and wasting in infants from 3 to 12 months, adjusting for confounding factors. The median DDS for women was low, at 3.0 (interquartile range 3.0-4.0), relative to the threshold of consuming five or more food groups daily. Infants of women in highest quartile of DDS (diverse diets) were less likely to be underweight (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.80) compared with infants of women in Quartile 1 (p for trend <0.001) in models controlling for maternal factors. There was no significant association between DDS and stunting or wasting. Our findings suggest a relationship between higher maternal dietary diversity and lower risk of underweight in infancy. These findings suggest that programmes to improve infant growth could additionally consider strengthening prenatal dietary diversity to improve child outcomes globally."

However, reinfection can occur rapidly in the absence of clean water and sanitation coupled with unhygienic behaviour. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of an integrated package of interventions, consisting of preventive chemotherapy, community-led total sanitation (CLTS) and health education, on the prevalence of helminth and intestinal protozoa infections and on participants' knowledge, attitude, practice and beliefs (KAPB) towards these diseases including water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional survey was carried out in nine communities of south-central Côte d'Ivoire to assess people's infection with helminths and intestinal protozoa and KAPB. Subsequently, interventions were targeted to five communities, while the remaining communities served as control. The intervention encouraged latrine construction and an evaluation was done 6-7 months later to determine open defecation status of the respective communities. Anthelminthic treatment was provided to all community members. A follow-up cross-sectional survey was conducted approximately one year later, using the same procedures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, 810 people had complete baseline and follow-up data and were given anthelminthic treatment.

Two large-scale baseline health surveys, carried out in 2001/2002 in two communities that were affected by the Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project in central Lao PDR, were analysed. For the population to be resettled on the Nakai plateau it was observed that access to clean water and basic sanitation facilities was lacking. Faecal examinations revealed a high infection prevalence for Ascaris lumbricoides (67.7%), but relatively low prevalences for hookworm (9.7%), Taenia spp. (4.8%), Enterobius vermicularis (4.4%), Trichuris trichiura (3.9%), Strongyloides stercoralis (1.4%) and Opisthorchis viverrini (0.9%). For the population in the Xe Bang Fai downstream area, rapid diagnostic tests for malaria carried out in the rainy season found a prevalence below 1%, which might be explained by the complete coverage of households with insecticide-treated nets (99.8%). Anthropometric measurements in both populations suggest that wasting, stunting and underweight in under 5-year-old children were moderate to high; 15.9-17.5%, 40.4-55.7% and 35.8-55.7%, respectively. One out of six individuals aged above 14 years were malnourished, most likely as a result of early childhood wasting. Moderate anaemia, assessed by age- and sex-specific haemoglobin levels, was present in 43.8% (Nakai) and 54.9% of the individuals examined (Xe Bang Fai).

Toxigenic coliforms were equally common in all age groups from both well-to-do and poor families. Enteropathogenic parasites appeared in increasing frequency with age. They were more common in artificially fed children and in children from families of low socio-economic level. The occurrence of multiple infection with mixtures of enteric pathogens increased with increasing age.

For three months fortnightly, histories of diarrhea were taken for all children under six years of age among 1,350 families to estimate age-specific rates of diarrhea in the population. A total of 247 randomly sampled families, termed sentinel families, were visited once during the study for prolonged observations of water-sanitation practices. Behaviors potentially affecting incidence of diarrhea were compared in a case group (n = 45), defined as sentinel families whose children had rates at least 1.7 times the rates expected for similarly aged children, and in a control group (n = 53), defined as sentinel families without any episodes of childhood diarrhea during the period of observation. Three practices differentiated the two groups: more control (82%) than case (53%) mothers who were observed to prepare food washed their hands before beginning the preparation (p less than 0.01); fewer control families (33%) than case families (80%) had ambulatory children who, when observed to defecate, did so in the family's living area (p less than 0.01); and fewer control (30%) than case (47%) families had children who were observed to place garbage or waste products in their mouth (p less than 0.10).

The control population did not receive any interventions, but had access to the usual government and private WSH facilities. After 1987 no external support was provided to maintain these provisions. A cross-sectional follow-up survey, which was carried out in 1992, involved about 500 randomly selected households from the intervention and control areas. In 1992 about 82% of the pumps were still in good functional condition and of these, 94% had been functioning well in 1987. Fewer latrines were functional in 1992 (64%) than at the end of 1987 (93%). In the former intervention area about 84% of the adults were using sanitary latrines in 1992 compared with only 7% in the control area. Knowledge related to disease transmission, however, was poor and similar in both areas. People claimed that they used the WSH facilities to improve the quality of their lives.

Implemented by a non-profit organization, with national (Integrated Child Development Services [ICDS]) and city-level (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai [MCGM]) government partners, the programme screened 7,759 children between May 2014 and April 2015. During this period, the programme admitted 705 moderately wasted and 189 severely wasted children into the treatment group and 6,820 not wasted children into the prevention group. Both prevention and treatment groups received growth monitoring, referrals to public health facilities, and home-based counselling (if <6 months) by community health workers. Treatment groups received additional home-based counselling and access to medical screenings. Severely wasted children also received access to ready-to-use therapeutic food. The study assessed default rates, wasting status, and average weight gain 3 months after admission. Factors associated with growth faltering in the prevention group were explored using logistic regression. Default rates for the severely wasted, moderately wasted, and prevention group were 12.7%, 20.4%, and 22.1%, respectively. Recovery rate was 42.4% for the severely wasted and 61.3% for the moderately wasted. For the moderately wasted, mean weight gain was 2.1 g/kg/day, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.6, 2.6], and 4.5 g/kg/day for the severely wasted, 95% CI [3.1, 5.9]. Among prevention group children, 3.6% faltered into wasting-3.2% into moderate and 0.4% into severe.

Defining the incidence of this disorder, its pathophysiological features, and its contribution to impaired linear and ponderal growth has been hampered by the difficulty in directly sampling the small intestinal mucosa and microbial community (microbiota).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this study, among 110 young children (mean age, 18 months) with linear growth stunting who were living in an urban slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and had not benefited from a nutritional intervention, we performed endoscopy in 80 children who had biopsy-confirmed EED and available plasma and duodenal samples. We quantified the levels of 4077 plasma proteins and 2619 proteins in duodenal biopsy samples obtained from these children. The levels of bacterial strains in microbiota recovered from duodenal aspirate from each child were determined with the use of culture-independent methods. In addition, we obtained 21 plasma samples and 27 fecal samples from age-matched healthy children living in the same area. Young germ-free mice that had been fed a Bangladeshi diet were colonized with bacterial strains cultured from the duodenal aspirates.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the bacterial strains that were obtained from the children, the absolute levels of a shared group of 14 taxa (which are not typically classified as enteropathogens) were negatively correlated with linear growth (length-for-age z score, r = -0.49; P = 0.003) and positively correlated with duodenal proteins involved in immunoinflammatory responses. The representation of these 14 duodenal taxa in fecal microbiota was significantly different from that in samples obtained from healthy children (P<0.001 by permutational multivariate analysis of variance). Enteropathy of the small intestine developed in gnotobiotic mice that had been colonized with cultured duodenal strains obtained from children with EED.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results provide support for a causal relationship between growth stunting and components of the small intestinal microbiota and enteropathy and offer a rationale for developing therapies that target these microbial contributions to EED.

            "abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STHs) and undernutrition are common health problems in developing countries. Several reports showed that STH and undernutrition are often associated. The main aim of this study was to determine the association of STH and undernutrition among schoolchildren in Mettu town, Southwest Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design was employed. To collect socio-demographic data, semi-structured questionnaire and physical observation were used. Kato-Katz technique and Anthropometric measurements were also considered to see STH infection and determine the nutritional statuses of the study participants respectively. Then, the data generated from the study was managed using Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis to determine the association of demographic variables with infections of helminthes and assess the risk factors for nutritional status of the study participants respectively. As a result, among the 392 study schoolchildren, 331 (84.4%) children were positive for different species of STH and undernutrition accounted 32.6%. Ascaris lumbricoides (39.0%), Trichuris trichiura (32.9%) and hookworm (28.1%) are the predominant STH identified from the study participants. Age, maternal educational and occupation status, and fingernail status of children were found significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the risk of getting STH. Bivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, age (AOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.53, 6.59), maternal illiteracy (AOR 0.13, 95% CI 0.91, 0.34) and maternal occupation (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08, 5.91) were major co-founding factors for the prevalence of STH among study participants. In addition, children with T. trichiura infection were more likely (P < 0.01) to suffer from undernutrition (AOR 0.52, 95% CI 0.31, 0.83). Thus, the findings revealed the high prevalence of STH and it has significant association with undernutrition among school age children in the study area. Anti-helminthic mass drug administration and maternal health education should be anticipated to curve the tragedy."

A significant portion of individuals (17.6%) were not offered PC. The predominant reason for not achieving the target coverage of 90% was beneficiary absenteeism during MDA (6.6% ALB, 6.8% PZQ), followed by drug distributors failing to reach all households (4.7% ALB, 4.8% PZQ), and beneficiaries not informed of the program (1.3% ALB, 1.7% PZQ).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Programmatic actions will need to be taken during the next MDA campaign to achieve the targeted Geshiyaro project coverage threshold across data collection and program engagement.

            "abstract": "Diarrhea remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among children in developing countries. Water, sanitation, and hygiene practices (WASH) have demonstrated improved diarrhea-related outcomes but may have limited implementation in certain communities. This study analyzes the adoption and effect of WASH-based practices on diarrhea in children under age five in the rural Busiya chiefdom in northwestern Tanzania. In a cross-sectional analysis spanning July-September 2019, 779 households representing 1338 under-five children were surveyed. Among households, 250 (32.1%) reported at least one child with diarrhea over a two-week interval. Diarrhea prevalence in under-five children was 25.6%. In per-household and per-child analyses, the strongest protective factors against childhood diarrhea included dedicated drinking water storage (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.18−0.36; p < 0.001), improved waste management (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27−0.51; p < 0.001), and separation of drinking water (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.24−0.59; p < 0.001). Improved water sources were associated with decreased risk of childhood diarrhea in per-household analysis (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52−0.99, p = 0.04), but not per-child analysis (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.65−1.05, p = 0.13). Diarrhea was widely treated (87.5%), mostly with antibiotics (44.0%) and oral rehydration solution (27.3%).

The survey is cross-sectional in design with use of standardized tools. The sampling frame used is an updated version of the frame from the 2011 National Population and Housing Census. The participants were children under 5 years of age (n = 2414).

It is essential to design more specific interventions by focusing on the key determinants that may directly or indirectly influence malnutrition in India. Methods: Utilizing data from the National Family and Health Survey-4 (NFHS) (2015-16), we developed a structural equation model to find the direct, indirect, and total effect of various determinants on stunting, wasting, and underweight. We used spatial analysis to identify local occurrences of factors that are critical in controlling malnutrition. A p-value of 0.05 was considered to be significant throughout the study. Analysis was performed using STATA (version 15.1MP) and GeoDa software (version 1.14). Results: A final sample of 90, 842 children of 0-24 months of age was selected for the analysis. The CFI and TLI values of 0.98 and 0.93, respectively, are indicative of a good fit model. Moran's I value of global spatial autocorrelation for the widespread presence of diarrhea, poor drinking water source, exclusive breastfeeding, low birth weight, no prenatal visits, poor toilet facility was observed to be 0.446, 0.638, 0.345, 0.439, 0.620, and 0.727, respectively. Conclusion: A robust direct relation was observed for diarrhea, exclusive breastfeeding, and children born with stunting, underweight, and wasting. The variables associated indirectly with the outcome variables were the education of the mother, residence, and desired pregnancy. The identification of hotspots through spatial analysis would help revive control strategies in the affected area according to geographical needs. It is extensively addressed that interventions related to health and nutrition during the first 1, 000 days of life is crucial to seize the upshoot of growth floundering among children."

Instances of wasting or poor weight gain may precede linear growth retardation. We analyzed longitudinal anthropometric data for 1599 children from 8 cohort studies to determine the effect of wasting [weight-for-length Z-score (WLZ) < -2] and variability in WLZ in the first 17 mo on length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) at 18-24 mo of age. In addition, we considered the effects of change in WLZ during the previous 6-mo period on length at 18 and 24 mo. Wasting at 6-11 or 12-17 mo was associated with decreased LAZ; however, children who experienced wasting only at 0-5 mo did not suffer any long-term growth deficits compared with children with no wasting during any period. Children with greater WLZ variability (≥0.5 SD) in the first 17 mo of life were shorter [LAZ = -0.51 SD (95% CI: -0.67, -0.36 SD)] at 18-24 mo of age than children with WLZ variability <0.5.

Studies were included regardless of design, location, language or publication status. Studies were assessed for methodological quality using the STROBE guidelines. Twenty-two studies conducted in 21 countries met the inclusion criteria. Studies show a pattern of increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with shared sanitation compared to individual household latrines.

However, such evidence is limited, does not adequately address likely confounding, and does not identify potentially important distinctions among types of shared facilities. As reliance on shared sanitation is increasing, further research is necessary to determine the circumstances, if any, under which shared sanitation can offer a safe, appropriate and acceptable alternative to individual household latrines."

            "abstract": "Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have been proposed as an important complement to deworming programs for sustainable control of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. We aimed to determine whether a community-based WASH program had additional benefits in reducing STH infections compared with community deworming alone. We conducted the WASH for WORMS cluster-randomized controlled trial in 18 rural communities in Timor-Leste. Intervention communities received a WASH intervention that provided access to an improved water source, promoted improved household sanitation, and encouraged handwashing with soap. All eligible community members in intervention and control arms received albendazole every 6 months for 2 years. The primary outcomes were infection with each STH, measured using multiplex real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We compared outcomes between study arms using generalized linear mixed models, accounting for clustering at community, household, and individual levels. At study completion, the integrated WASH and deworming intervention did not have an effect on infection with Ascaris spp. (relative risk [RR] 2.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66-12.48, P = 0.159) or Necator americanus (RR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.52-1.89, P = 0.987), compared with deworming alone. At the last follow-up, open defecation was practiced by 66.1% (95% CI: 54.2-80.2) of respondents in the control arm versus 40.2% (95% CI: 25.3-52.6) of respondents in the intervention arm (P = 0.005). We found no evidence that the WASH intervention resulted in additional reductions in STH infections beyond that achieved with deworming alone over the 2-year trial period. The role of WASH on STH infections over a longer period of time and in the absence of deworming remains to be determined."

            "abstract": "Conventional indicators - weight-for-age, height-for-age, weight-for-height and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) reflect different facets of the nutritional status. Weight-for-age is the most commonly used indicator. When used individually or in combination, conventional indices fail to depict the overall magnitude of undernutrition in the population. Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF) is an alternative classification system which attempts to fill this lacuna. Thus, we undertook this study with the objective to compare the prevalence of undernutrition using CIAF and the conventional indices. We included 634 children aged between 2 to 4 years from anganwadis located in three areas of Mumbai. Weight, height and MUAC measurements were taken. Z scores were computed for weight-for-age (WAZ), height-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-height (WHZ) using WHO Anthro software. Children were classified as per the conventional indices and CIAF. The prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting was 35.7%, 33.8% and 18.5% respectively. None of the children had MUAC < 11.5 cm. About 1% of the children were moderately wasted according to MUAC. As per CIAF, 47.8% children were undernourished. According to CIAF, one-third of the undernourished children had single anthropometric failure while half of them had dual failure and 17.1% had multiple failures. When compared with the conventional indices, CIAF could recognize 12.1%, 14.0%, 29.3% and 46.7% more undernourished children than WAZ, HAZ, WHZ and MUAC respectively. In conclusion, CIAF is seen to have many advantages over the conventional indices. CIAF is useful in assessing the overall magnitude of undernutrition and identifying children with multiple anthropometric failures. It also recognizes more undernourished children than all the conventional indices. Therefore, CIAF should be used more widely as a tool for nutritional assessment particularly in developing countries where the burden of undernutrition is high."

            "abstract": "Three of four recent major sanitation intervention trials found no effect on diarrhea. These results conflicted with longstanding beliefs from decades of literature. To understand this discordance, we placed recent trials into the historical context that preceded them in two ways. First, we evaluated the history of published literature reviews on sanitation and diarrhea. Second, we conducted meta-analyses on studies from the most recent systematic review to uncover features that predict effectiveness. We found that 13 literature reviews dating to 1983 consistently estimated a significant protective effect of sanitation against diarrhea. However, these were marred by flawed studies and inappropriately averaged effects across widely heterogeneous interventions and contexts. Our meta-analyses highlight that the overall effect of sanitation on diarrhea was largely driven by sewerage and interventions that improved more than sanitation alone. There is no true overall effect of sanitation because variability between intervention types and implementation contexts is too complex to average. Ultimately, the null effects of recent latrine interventions are not surprising. Instead, the one trial that found a strong relative reduction in diarrhea is the historical outlier. The development of transformative sanitation interventions requires a better understanding of the social and environmental contexts that determine intervention effectiveness."

Monthly variation in growth pattern was examined for 71 boys and girls 0-49 months of age. At the height of the monsoon season, 71% of children were moderately stunted, but none was wasted (mean -2.61 SD height-for-age and -0.91 SD weight-for-height by reference to NCHS z-score values). Measures of stunting deteriorated from moderate to severe after 1 year of age. No differences by sex or ethnicity were detected. Environmental changes from the winter to the monsoon seasons were reflected in significant losses of weight and lower weight-for-height z-scores, especially for 0-35 month-olds, although height for 12-35-month-olds continued to be gained over this period. Growth velocity was significantly related to previous growth status (thinner and shorter children did not show catch-up in height or weight) and to morbidity reported over the period of observation. The prevalence of illnesses rose six-fold from the winter to the monsoon, and children with a high frequency of illnesses experienced a significant shortfall in weight and height increments. A poor diet and recurrent illnesses explain the slow and uneven growth of these children. Despite an increase in women's agricultural workloads in the monsoon season, childcare patterns per se do not seem to adversely affect small children. Small stature through later childhood and in adults is one consequence of the growth pattern seen at these young ages."

Similarly, government effectiveness (AOR = 72.2; p = 0.007), regulatory quality (AOR = 0.0015; p = 0.004) and control of corruption (AOR = 0.0005; p = 0.000) were associated with underweight. None of the governance indicators were associated with wasting. On the other hand, there is no statistically significant association observed between public health spending and urbanization with childhood undernutrition. However, other socio-demographic variables play a significant effect on reducing of child undernutrition.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study indicates that good governance in the country plays a significant role for reducing childhood undernutrition along with other socio-demographic factors. Concerned bodies should focus on improving governance and producing a quality policy and at the same time monitor its implementation and adherence."

            "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to assess the geographic inequalities in access to improved water and sanitation facilities among Nepalese households. We conducted this study based on cross-sectional data obtained from Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys. The quality of water sources and sanitation were defined by World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The geographic categories used in the analyses included developmental region, ecological zone, and urbanicity. Percentages of households having access to improved toilet (5.6% in 1996 vs. 40.5% in 2016) and water (19.3% in 1996 vs. 27% in 2016) facilities has been increasing steadily since 1996 with a great proportion of the households still lacking access to these services. The number of households sharing the same toilet and traveling time to reach water sources have also decreased at the same time. Households in Far Western and Mountains had the lowest odds of having access to improved toilet and water facilities. Noticeable progress has been achieved in improving WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) coverage at national level, however, it is uneven across developmental and ecological zones. Households in the Far Western and Mountain regions appeared to be the most geographically disadvantaged in terms of having access to improved water and sanitation facilities."

            "abstract": "We examine factors associated with the use of basic water supply and sanitation services as part of an integrated community-based nutrition programme which included a drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) intervention and emphasise findings related to health risk perceptions. Data were collected from 2658 households in four regions in Ethiopia with a cross-sectional survey in WaSH intervention areas, as well as in control areas, where the intervention was not implemented. The data were analysed using bivariate and multivariable regression analysis. Awareness of health risk factors related to inadequate WaSH was high in the programme area. The use of basic water and sanitation services was associated with several health risk perceptions: Perceiving water quality as good increased the odds of using basic water services as opposed to believing the water quality was poor (OR 3.94; CI 3.06⁻5.08; p ≤ 0.001). Believing that drinking unsafe water was the main cause for diarrhoea increased the odds of using basic water services (OR 1.48; CI 1.20⁻1.81; p ≤ 0.001). In the WaSH intervention group, the use of basic sanitation was more likely than in the control group. The use of basic sanitation was associated with households who had previously received sanitation training, as opposed to such who had not (OR 1.55; CI 1.22⁻1.97; p ≤ 0.001). Perceiving dirty space as the main cause of diarrhoea (OR 1.81; CI 1.50⁻2.19; p ≤ 0.001), and privacy when using a latrine (OR 2.00; CI 1.67⁻2.40; p ≤ 0.001), were associated with higher odds of using basic sanitation. Households that indicated a disadvantage of owning a latrine was maintenance costs were less likely to use basic sanitation (OR 0.49; CI 0.38⁻0.63; p ≤ 0.001). Risk perceptions were important determinants of use of basic services. The findings point to risk perceptions motivating the application of positive WaSH-related and health-protective ours. This suggests that well-designed health risk communication strategies may be effective for engaging households in healthy WaSH behaviour."

However, this reduction is heterogeneous. In this study, we aimed to determine the factors associated with the 5-year school-level infection prevalence and relative reduction (RR) in prevalence in Kenya following the implementation of the program. Multiple variables related to treatment, water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and environmental factors were assembled and included in mixed-effects linear regression models to identify key determinants of the school location STH and schistosomiasis prevalence and RR. Reduced prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was associated with low (< 1%) baseline prevalence, seven rounds of treatment, high (50-75%) self-reported coverage of household handwashing facility equipped with water and soap, high (20-25°C) land surface temperature, and community population density of 5-10 people per 100 m2. Reduced hookworm prevalence was associated with low (< 1%) baseline prevalence and the presence of a school feeding program. Reduced Trichuris trichiura prevalence was associated with low (< 1%) baseline prevalence. Reduced Schistosoma mansoni prevalence was associated with low (< 1%) baseline prevalence, three treatment rounds, and high (> 75%) reported coverage of a household improved water source. Reduced Schistosoma haematobium was associated with high aridity index. Analysis indicated that a combination of factors, including the number of treatment rounds, multiple related program interventions, community- and school-level WASH, and several environmental factors had a major influence on the school-level infection transmission and reduction."

This study examines the risk factors associated with pediatric diarrhea and carriage of zoonotic enteric pathogens among children living in communities where smallholder livestock production is prevalent. We conducted an observational study of children younger than 5 years that included the analysis of child (n = 306) and animal (n = 480) fecal samples for Campylobacter spp., atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, Salmonella spp., Yersinia spp., Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia lamblia. Among these seven pathogens, Giardia was the most commonly identified pathogen among children and animals in the same household, most of which was found in child-dog pairs. Campylobacter spp. was also relatively common within households, particularly among child-chicken and child-guinea pig pairs. We used multivariable Poisson regression models to assess risk factors associated with a child being positive for at least one zoonotic enteric pathogen or having diarrhea during the last week. Children who interacted with domestic animals-a behavior reported by nearly three-quarters of households owning animals-were at an increased risk of colonization with at least one zoonotic enteric pathogen (prevalence ratio [PR] = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.00-2.42). The risk of diarrhea in the last seven days was elevated but not statistically significant (PR = 2.27, CI: 0.91, 5.67). Interventions that aim to reduce pediatric exposures to enteric pathogens will likely need to be incorporated with approaches that remove animal fecal contamination from the domestic environment and encourage behavior change aimed at reducing children's contact with animal feces through diverse exposure pathways."

Data were pooled across countries, and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between number and sex of siblings and malnutrition outcomes (wasting, stunting, underweight; based on anthropometric data), adjusting for country and key social and maternal-child health indicators in sex stratified analyses. Number of brothers increased the odds for severe wasting [1 vs. 0 brothers adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.31, 95 % CI = 1.11, 1.55; 2 vs. 0 brothers AOR = 1.36, 95 % CI = 1.07, 1.73] for girls but not boys.

For underweight, three or more sisters increased the odds for severe underweight for girls (AOR = 1.27, 95 % CI = 1.04, 1.57) but not boys. Having brothers heightens girl risk for acute malnutrition (wasting), where having multiple sisters increases girl risk for chronic malnutrition (stunting/underweight).

            "abstract": "When using toilets where the urine and faeces are collected separately for reuse as nutrients in agriculture, the collected matter should be disinfected. One way to do this is by thermal composting. Composting of different material mixes was investigated in a laboratory-scale experiment. This showed that the best mixture for dry thermal composting was a mix of faeces, food waste and amendment. The urine was collected separately by use of urine-diverting toilets. A new method was developed to mathematically evaluate and estimate the safety margins of pathogen inactivation during thermal composting. The method is based upon a mathematical calculation of the number of times total inactivation (at least 12log(10) reduction) of the organisms is achieved. In a pilot-scale experiment, the disinfection of a faeces/food waste mix was performed with a calculated safety margin of more than 37 times the total die-off of Enteroviruses and some 550 times that of Ascaris. Thus, well functioning composting seems to be effective for disinfection of faecal matter. To get a high temperature in all of the material, the reactor has to have sufficient insulation. A major disadvantage is the initial need for handling the raw un-disinfected material. The degradation of the organic matter in the compost was almost 75%, resulting in a small final volume that could safely be recycled."

In fact, the most frequently isolated intestinal helminths in dogs are distributed worldwide, and most of them have zoonotic potential (i.e., ascarids and ancylostomatids). The aims of this survey were to evaluate citizen awareness of health risks for animals and humans related to canine faecal pollution and to estimate the presence and prevalence of intestinal helminths in dog faeces collected in green public areas in three municipalities of Italy (Padua, Rome and Teramo). The awareness of citizens about the health risks related to faecal pollution was evaluated using questionnaires submitted to 313 dog owners and 159 non-dog owners in Padua (n = 341) and Rome (n = 131). Most dog owners (85.4%) declared they picked up their dog's faeces every time, and these data were confirmed by operators secretly observing dog owners. Moreover, 84.3% participants were aware of the existence of a municipal regulation concerning the correct management of animals in public areas with no significant differences between dog owners and non-dog owners, whereas Rome citizens were significantly more aware than Padua citizens. Nonetheless, only 10.9% (51/469) of responders knew the health risks related to canine faecal pollution, with no significant differences between dog and non-dog owners. A total of 677 dog stool samples were collected and copromicroscopically analysed. Forty-eight (7.1%) samples were positive for at least one parasite species, with significantly lower prevalence values in Padua (2.2%) than in Rome (11.9%) and Teramo (8.6%). The highest prevalence was detected for Trichuris vulpis (4.4%), followed by Toxocara canis (1.9%); T. vulpis presented significantly lower prevalence in Padua than in the other cities. Other helminths were found with values under 0.5% in the investigated cities. This survey shows that most citizens are unaware of the health risk related to abandoned canine faeces on public soils. Nevertheless, laboratory results suggest a limited risk for dog and human health, but the zoonotic risk due to the high vitality of infective helminths eggs in the soil should always be considered."

The objective of this secondary data analysis was to determine the risk of linear growth faltering and difference in linear growth velocity in LBW infants born to short mothers (<150 cm) compared to those born to mothers with height ≥150 cm during the first year of life. This analysis uses data from a community-based randomized controlled trial of 2,052 hospital-born term infants with birthweight ≤2,500g from urban low-middle socioeconomic neighbourhoods in Delhi, India. Data on maternal height and infant birth length were available from 1,858 (90.5%) of the infants. Infant anthropometry outcomes were measured at birth, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age. We found that infants born to short mothers had around twofold higher odds of stunting and lower attained length-for-age Z scores compared to infants of mothers with height ≥150 cm, at all ages of assessment. Linear growth velocity was significantly lower in infants of short mothers particularly in the first 6 months of life. We conclude that LBW infants born to short mothers are at a higher risk of stunting and have slower postnatal growth velocity resulting in lower attained length-for-age Z scores in infancy. Evidence-based strategies need to be tested to optimize growth velocity in LBW infants especially those born to short mothers."

Being an underweight mother, parents with a lower level of education and poorer households were the key risk factors for stunting and underweight.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings show an evidence-based need for targeted interventions to improve education and household income-generating activities among poor households to reduce inequalities and reduce the burden of child malnutrition in Bangladesh."

            "abstract": "Formative research for hygiene promotion was used to gather data relating to hygiene practices in rural Kyrgyzstan. Some of the hand-washing and faeces disposal practices observed were sub-optimal from a public health perspective. In combination with the poverty, limited medical services and poor water supply infrastructure characteristic of the study area, it is likely that these factors increase the risk of diarrhoeal infections among Kyrgyz children. An association was found between increased rates of hand-washing following latrine use and ownership of a washstand. This offers some empirical support for the idea that promotion of hand-washing technologies can form a useful part of a hygiene promotion intervention. The process followed in conducting the formative research is outlined in some detail along with a discussion of some of its achievements and limitations."

Before intervention, 28.6% of children excreted eggs of at least one parasite, hookworm being the most common (23%), followed by Trichuris trichiura (1.9%), Hymenolepis nana (1.9%), Enterobius vermicularis (0.9%), Ascaris lumbricoides (0.5%), and multiple kinds of helminthes (0.5%). Strongyloides stercoralis was never detected. Poor sanitation and personal hygiene, and walking barefoot were considered the main risk factors for intestinal helminth infections. The success of 400 mg albendazole single dose mass treatment was initially frustrated by the poor quality of the drug formulation used, only containing half of the indicated amount of albendazole. Using another formulation quickly reduced the hookworm infection rate. Praziquantel was used to treat H. nana infections. After three years of intervention, intestinal helminth infections were reduced to 3.3% (p<0.0001). We conclude that interventions combining health education, improvement of sanitation and mass treatment effectively control intestinal helminth infections, but the quality of the drugs used is an important factor."

Wasting, stunting and underweight were defined as <-2.0 z-scores using WHO growth standards. Low MUAC was defined as <12.5 cm. We defined WaSt as concurrent wasting and stunting. Prevalence of WaSt was 4.96% (95% CI [4.64, 5.29]). WaSt was more prevalent in lean than harvest season (5.21% vs. 4.53%; p = .018). About half (53.92%) of WaSt children had low MUAC, and all were underweight. Younger children aged <36 months had more WaSt, particularly males. Males with WaSt had higher median MUAC than females (12.50 vs. 12.10 cm; p < .001). A WAZ <-2.60 threshold detected WaSt with excellent sensitivity (99.02%) and high specificity (90.71%). MUAC threshold <13.20 cm had good sensitivity (81.58%) and moderate specificity (76.15%) to detect WaSt. WaSt prevalence of 5% is a public health concern, given its high mortality risk. All children with WaSt were underweight and half had low MUAC. WAZ and MUAC could be useful tools for detecting WaSt. Prevalence monitoring and prospective studies on WAZ and MUAC cut-offs for WaSt detection are recommended. Future consideration to integrate WAZ into therapeutic feeding programmes is recommended to detect and treat WaSt children."

A contaminated environment is likely to contribute to stunting: frequent faecal-oral transmission possibly causes environmental enteropathy, a chronic inflammatory disorder that may contribute to faltering growth in children.

The provision of other interventions, consisting of preventive chemotherapy at high population level coverage together with water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) and changes in risk behaviour, should enable sustainable control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis and ultimately interrupt transmission.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      Two interventions will be implemented by the project: (i) community-wide biannual albendazole and annual praziquantel treatment with a target of 80-90% treatment coverage (\"expanded MDA\"); and (ii) provision of WaSH with behaviour change communication (BCC), within the Wolaita zone, Ethiopia. The project has three study arms: (i) expanded community-wide MDA, WaSH and BCC; (ii) expanded community-wide MDA only; and (iii) annual school-based MDA (the current National STH/schistosomiasis Control Programme). The impact of these interventions will be evaluated through prevalence mapping at baseline and endline (after four rounds of MDA), combined with annual longitudinal parasitological surveillance in defined cohorts of people to monitor trends in prevalence and reinfection throughout the project. Treatment coverage and individual compliance to treatment will be monitored by employing fingerprint biometric technology and barcoded identification cards at treatment. WaSH utilisation will be evaluated through school and household level observations and annual WaSH assessment survey. Complementary qualitative surveys will explore practices, cultural and social drivers of risk behaviours, uptake of WaSH and treatment, and assessing the impact of the BCC.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The study has the potential to define an 'End Game' for STH and schistosomiasis programmes through provision of multiple interventions. Interrupting transmission of these infections would eliminate the need for long-term repeated MDA, lead to sustained health improvements in children and adults, thereby allowing health systems to focus on other disease control priorities."

            "abstract": "Half the children under the age of 5 years in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are undernourished, more than double the global average with rural areas disproportionately affected. This study examines factors associated with stunting, wasting and underweight in cocoa growers' children (<5 years) in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (ARoB), using data from a comprehensive 2017 cross-sectional livelihoods survey. Sixteen independent predictors for stunting, wasting and underweight were selected based on the UNICEF Conceptual Framework of Determinants of Undernutrition. We used multilevel logistic mixed regression models to measure the association of the explanatory variables with stunting, wasting and underweight. At the household level, the adjusted OR (aOR) of stunting (aOR=1.71,95% CI 1.14 to 2.55) and underweight (aOR=2.11, 95% CI 1.16 to 3.82) increased significantly among children from households with unimproved toilet facilities. The aOR for underweight also increased among children from households without access to clean drinking water (aOR=1.97, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.29). Short maternal stature was significantly associated with child stunting, the odds increased as maternal height decreased (from 150 to <155 cm, aOR=1.52, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.26) (<150 cm, aOR=2.37, 95% CI 1.29 to 4.35). At the individual level, the odds of a child being underweight increased with birth order (second born, aOR=1.92, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.36; third born, aOR=6.77, 95% CI 2.00 to 22.82). Compared with children less than 6 months, children aged 6-23 months and 24-59 months had a higher odds of being stunted (aOR=3.27, 95% CI 1.57 to 6.78 and aOR=2.82, 95% CI 1.40 to 5.67) and underweight (aOR=4.83, 95% CI 1.36 to 17.24 and aOR=4.59, 95% CI 1.29 to 16.26). No variables were found to be significant for wasting. Interventions that simultaneously target key life stages for women and children and the underlying social and environmental determinants are required for sustained improvements to undernutrition."

            "abstract": "The current global strategy for the control of soil-transmitted helminthiasis emphasises periodic administration of anthelminthic drugs to at-risk populations. However, this approach fails to address the root social and ecological causes of soil-transmitted helminthiasis. For sustainable control, it has been suggested that improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene behaviour are required. We designed a 5-year multi-intervention trial in Menghai county, Yunnan province, People's Republic of China. Three different interventions were implemented, each covering a village inhabited by 200-350 people. The interventions consisted of (i) initial health education at study inception and systematic treatment of all individuals aged ≥2 years once every year with a single dose of albendazole; (ii) initial health education and bi-annual albendazole administration; and (iii) bi-annual treatment coupled with latrine construction at family level and regular health education. Interventions were rigorously implemented for 3 years, whilst the follow-up, which included annual albendazole distribution, lasted for 2 more years. Before the third round of treatment, the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was reduced by only 2.8% in the annual treatment arm, whilst bi-annual deworming combined with latrine construction and health education resulted in a prevalence reduction of 53.3% (p<0.001). All three control approaches significantly reduced the prevalence of Trichuris trichiura and hookworm, with the highest reductions achieved when chemotherapy was combined with sanitation and health education. The prevalence of T. trichiura remained at 30% and above regardless of the intervention. Only bi-annual treatment combined with latrine construction and health education significantly impacted on the prevalence of Taenia spp., but none of the interventions significantly reduced the prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis. Our findings support the notion that in high-endemicity areas, sustainable control of soil-transmitted helminth infections necessitates measures to reduce faecal environmental contamination to complement mass drug administration. However, elimination of soil-transmitted helminthiasis will not be achieved in the short run even with a package of interventions, and probably requires improvements in living conditions, changes in hygiene behaviour and more efficacious anthelminthic drugs and treatment regimens."

This study investigated the factors associated with the nutritional status of school children in a rural municipality in Cebu, Philippines. Children aged 6-12 years (n = 327) and their parents were asked to participate. Children's anthropometric measurements were taken in schools, while interviews and measurements of parents were conducted at home. Children's nutritional status was assessed using height-for-age (HAZ) and weight-for-age (WAZ) z scores, while body mass index (BMI) was used for parents. Children's dietary patterns and physical activity, and household characteristics, such as food insecurity, eating practices, water/sanitation/hand washing facilities, and sociodemographic status, were collected. Of 327 school children, 37.3% were stunted, while 35.1% were underweight in this rural community. HAZ and WAZ were negatively associated with household size, and positively associated with household income and parental BMI in multivariate least-squares regression models. Severe food insecurity was negatively associated with WAZ, which suggested that the experiences of severe food insecurity (i.e., not eating for a day) had a significant impact on nutritional status of children."

Cut off point of p-value was taken as 0.05 to test the significance.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Inter-country disparities were revealed, about half of Bengali children in India and two-fifths in Bangladesh being prone to anth-failure. Stunting and underweight were more prevalent in both countries than wasting. Maternal undernutrition, lack of maternal education, and poor wealth index were common factors of anth-failure for both countries. Children in Bangladesh developed anth-failure after the end of breastfeeding period, indicating a lack of nutritious food. Lack of antenatal care was another significant factor in Bangladesh. In India, the first child suffered from anth-failure due to lack of maternal education.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study provides a better understanding of multifactorial impact on child undernutrition. It is proposed that the emphasis should be on initiatives that improve maternal education and nutrition, child food security, boost household wealth index, and enhance mothers' access to health care. The study strongly recommends that the governments of Bangladesh and India invest financially in preventing child malnutrition, which will contribute to achieving the first four SDGs."

We compared markers of environmental enteropathy, parasite burden, and growth in 119 Bangladeshi children (≤ 48 months of age) across rural Bangladesh living in different levels of household environmental cleanliness defined by objective indicators of water quality and sanitary and hand-washing infrastructure. Adjusted for potential confounding characteristics, children from clean households had 0.54 SDs (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.06, 1.01) higher height-for-age z scores (HAZs), 0.32 SDs (95% CI = -0.72, 0.08) lower lactulose:mannitol (L:M) ratios in urine, and 0.24 SDs (95% CI = -0.63, 0.16) lower immunoglobulin G endotoxin core antibody (IgG EndoCAb) titers than children from contaminated households. After adjusting for age and sex, a 1-unit increase in the ln L:M was associated with a 0.33 SDs decrease in HAZ (95% CI = -0.62, -0.05). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that environmental contamination causes growth faltering mediated through environmental enteropathy."

            "abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminths, or parasitic intestinal worms, are among the most prevalent and geographically widespread parasitic infections in the world. Accurate diagnosis and quantification of helminth infection are critical for informing and assessing deworming interventions. The Kato-Katz thick smear technique, the most widely used laboratory method to quantitatively assess infection prevalence and infection intensity of helminths, has often been compared with other methods. Only a few small-scale studies, however, have considered ways to improve its diagnostic sensitivity. This study, conducted among 4,985 school-age children in an area of rural China with moderate prevalence of helminth infection, examines the effect on diagnostic sensitivity of the Kato-Katz technique when two fecal samples collected over consecutive days are examined and compared with a single sample. A secondary aim was to consider cost-effectiveness by calculating an estimate of the marginal costs of obtaining an additional fecal sample. Our findings show that analysis of an additional fecal sample led to increases of 23%, 26%, and 100% for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm prevalence, respectively. The cost of collecting a second fecal sample for our study population was approximately USD4.60 per fecal sample. Overall, the findings suggest that investing 31% more capital in fecal sample collection prevents an underestimation of prevalence by about 21%, and hence improves the diagnostic sensitivity of the Kato-Katz method. Especially in areas with light-intensity infections of soil-transmitted helminths and limited public health resources, more accurate epidemiological surveillance using multiple fecal samples will critically inform decisions regarding infection control and prevention."

In 482 houses in the 4 villages, interviews for the items of the questionnaire were conducted with the owner, housekeeper and children of the same family. In Pancana and Lalolang, 37.7% and 50% respectively of man inhabitants surveyed were fishermen, while in Lompo Riaja and Pattappa, 38.6% and 65.5% respectively were farmers. The highest proportion of official workers was 33.7% in Lompo Riaja. Educational level was low; 88.4% in Pancana, 90.4% in Lalolang, 62.1% in Lompo Riaja and 91.2% in Pattappa had elementary or below elementary school education.

The people without latrines usually defecated in rice fields, seaside or riverside. A total of 654 fecal samples was examined by the modified Kato-Katz thick smear method. Five nematode species, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis and unidentified Rhabditoids of free-living nature were detected. Cestode, Hymenolepis nana infection was confirmed. All the hookworms examined by the modified Harada-Mori culture technic were Necator americanus. Trichuris infection was most common, followed by hookworm and Ascaris infections, both in young (aged 4-14) and older (aged over 15) age groups. The prevalence of hookworm infection was significantly higher in males than in females of older age. Among the older age group, the prevalence of Trichuris infection was significantly lower in Lompo Riaja, while hookworm infection was the highest in Pattappa. Among all the inhabitants examined for parasite infection, 17.4% had 3 kinds of nematode, Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm.

            "abstract": "Research on micro-level assessment of the changes of socio-economic status following health interventions is very scarce. The use of household asset data to determine wealth indices is a common procedure for estimating socio-economic position in resource poor settings. In such settings information about income is usually lacking, and the collection of individual consumption or expenditure data would require in-depth interviews, posing a considerable risk of bias. In this study, we determined the socio-economic status of 213 households in a community population in an island in the north-western Tanzania before and 3 year after implementation of a participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention to control schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections. We constructed a household 'wealth index' based housing construction features (e.g., type of roof, walls, and floor) and durable assets ownership (e.g., bicycle, radio, etc.). We employed principal components analysis and classified households into wealth quintiles. The study revealed that asset variables with positive factor scores were associated with higher socio-economic status, whereas asset variables with negative factor scores were associated with lower socio-economic status. Overall, households which were rated as the poorest and very poor were on the decrease, whereas those rated as poor, less poor, and the least poor were on the increase after PHAST intervention. This decrease/increase was significant. The median shifted from -0.4376677 to 0.5001073, and the mean from -0.2605787 (SD; 2.005688) to 0.2605787 (SD; 1.831199). The difference in socio-economic status of the people between the 2 phases was highly statistically significant (P<0.001). We argue that finding of this study should be treated with caution as there were other interventions to control schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections which were running concurrently on Kome Island apart from PHAST intervention."

Low birth weight has been identified as a risk factor for child morbidity and mortality, especially among children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa. There is, however, a paucity of empirical literature establishing the association between low birth weight and undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the association between birth weight and nutritional status of children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Our analyses were performed on a weighted sample of 110,497 children under five years from 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

Niger had the highest prevalence of wasting (21.5%) and underweight (37.1%), whereas Burundi had the highest prevalence of stunting (51.7%). We found that children with low birth weight were more likely to be stunted [aOR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.58-1.78], underweight [aOR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.70-1.94], and wasted [aOR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.20-1.38] after controlling for covariates.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our study has demonstrated that low birth weight is a key determinant of undernutrition among children under five in sub-Saharan Africa.

To accelerate progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goal 3.2 target of ending preventable deaths of newborns and under-five by 2030, it is imperative for countries in sub-Saharan Africa to intensify interventions aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition.

Published peer reviewed literature was systematically screened during March to June 2018 using the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. There were no publication date restrictions. Thirty-eight peer reviewed papers were identified that met the inclusion criteria. The papers were analysed in groups, based on four categories of reported outcomes: (i) reduction of diarrhoeal disease and other hygiene-related diseases in school students; (ii) improved WASH knowledge, attitudes and hygiene behaviours among students; (iii) reduced disease burden and improved hygiene behaviours in students' households and communities; (iv) improved student enrolment and attendance. The typically unmeasured and unreported 'output' and/or 'exposure' of program fidelity and adherence was also examined. Several studies provide evidence of positive disease-related outcomes among students, yet other assessments did not find statistically significant differences in health or indicated that outcomes are dependent on the nature and context of interventions. Thirteen studies provide evidence of changes in WASH knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, such as hand-washing with soap. Further research is required to understand whether and how school-based WASH interventions might improve hygiene habits and health among wider family and community members. Evidence of the impact of school-based WASH programs in reducing student absence from school was mixed. Ensuring access to safe and sufficient water and sanitation and hygiene promotion in schools has great potential to improve health and education and to contribute to inclusion and equity, yet delivering school-based WASH intervention does not guarantee good outcomes.

Our objective was to assess the effectiveness of a household WASH package on the performance of an Outpatient Therapeutic feeding Program (OTP) for severe acute malnutrition (SAM). We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial embedded in a routine OTP. The study population included 20 health centers (clusters) from Mao and Mondo districts in Chad. Both arms received the OTP. The intervention arm received an additional household WASH package (chlorine, soap, water storage container, and promotion on its use). The primary objective measures were the relapse rates to SAM at 2 and 6 months post-recovery. The secondary objectives included the recovery rate from SAM, the time-to-recovery, the weight gain, and the diarrhea longitudinal prevalence in OTP. The study lasted from April 2015 to May 2016. Among the 1,603 recruited children, 845 were in the intervention arm and 758 in the control arm. No differences in the relapse rates were noticed at 2 (-0.4%; P = 0.911) and 6 (-1.0%; P = 0.532) months.

No statistical differences were noticed for the diarrhea longitudinal prevalence (-1.7%; P = 0.223) and the weight gain velocity (0.4 g/kg/d; P = 0.086).

Weighted prevalence rates for stunting (height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) <-2), wasting (weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) <-2) and underweight (weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ) <-2) were 41·6% (95% CI 38·9, 44·3%), 11·5% (95% CI 9·8, 13·2%) and 30·1% (95% CI 27·5, 32·8%), respectively. Prevalences of stunting, severe stunting (HAZ<-3) and underweight by level of household food insecurity were statistically significant (P<0·001). By multiple linear regression analyses and after adjustment for sociodemographic, child and environmental factors, household food access insecurity score was associated with HAZ (β=-0·02, P=0·01) and WAZ (β=-0·01, P=0·01) but was not associated with WHZ and BMI-for-age Z-score. A 10-point increase in household food access insecurity score was associated with a decrease in HAZ of 0·2 (95% CI 0·05, 0·39) and decrease in WAZ of 0·1 (95% CI 0·03, 0·27).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results from a nationally representative sample confirm the previously reported association of household food insecurity with stunting and underweight. Community nutrition interventions may use household food insecurity scales for identifying those households where children may be at risk of growth faltering."

            "abstract": "The transmission of intestinal schistosomiasis presumes that faecal materials containing viable schistosome eggs reach natural water bodies infested with snail intermediate host. So far there is little knowledge about the contamination dynamics of streams with schistosome eggs. We conducted a pilot study on defecating behaviour and hygienic practices in an Schistosoma mansoni endemic focus in Northern Senegal. Questionnaires were used to obtain quantitative data on hygienic practices and the use of latrines in 59 children. Although the community was well endowed with pit latrines, most of the children declared that they usually defecated somewhere else, in particular near the streams where the vegetation offers hideouts. Observations based on mapping of defecation sites showed that a considerable number of stools were left just a few meters from the riverbank, thus bearing a high risk of being washed off into the water. All these practices can easily lead to contamination of water bodies with schistosomae eggs. In order to improve hygienic practices and reduce fecal pollution of the environment, a health education model respecting local beliefs and customs would be indispensable."

We enrolled adult resident landlords on plots where at least one tenant lived. We allocated landlords 1:1 to intervention and control arms on the basis of a random number sequence. The intervention was developed using the Behaviour Centred Design approach and consisted of a series of group meetings designed to motivate sanitation quality improvement as a way to build wealth and reduce on-plot conflict; no subsidies or materials were provided. The control group received no intervention. The four primary outcomes were having a rotational cleaning system in place (to improve hygiene); having a solid door on the toilet used by tenants with an inside lock (for privacy); having an outside lock (for security); and having a sealed toilet (to reduce smell and contamination). We measured outcomes 1 month before the start of the intervention and 4 months after the end of the intervention. Data collectors measuring outcomes were blinded to group assignment. We analysed outcomes by intention to treat, including all landlords with study-end results. Because the outcomes were assumed to not be independent, we used a family-wise error rate of 0·05 to calculate an adjusted significance level of 0·0253. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03174015.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between June 9 and July 6, 2017, 1085 landlords were enrolled and randomly assigned to the intervention (n=543) or the control group (n=542).

We assessed the impact of CWFs on diarrhea, cryptosporidiosis prevention, and water quality in rural western Kenya. A randomized, controlled intervention trial was conducted in 240 households with infants 4-10 months old. Twenty-six weekly household surveys assessed infant diarrhea and health facility visits. Stool specimens from infants with diarrhea were examined for Cryptosporidium. Source water, filtered water, and filter retentate were tested for Cryptosporidium and/or microbial indicators. To estimate the effect of CWFs on health outcomes, logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were performed; odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Households reported using surface water (36%), public taps (29%), or rainwater (17%) as their primary drinking water sources, with no differences in treatment groups. Intervention households reported less diarrhea (7.6% versus 8.9%; OR: 0.86 [0.64-1.16]) and significantly fewer health facility visits for diarrhea (1.0% versus 1.9%; OR: 0.50 [0.30-0.83]). In total, 15% of intervention and 12% of control stools yielded Cryptosporidium (P = 0.26). Escherichia coli was detected in 93% of source water samples; 71% of filtered water samples met World Health Organization recommendations of < 1 E. coli/100 mL. Cryptosporidium was not detected in source water and was detected in just 2% of filter rinses following passage of large volumes of source water. Water quality was improved among CWF users; however, the short study duration and small sample size limited our ability to observe reductions in cryptosporidiosis."

            "abstract": "Helminths or worm infestations refer to worms that live as parasites in the human body and are a fundamental cause of disease associated with health and nutrition problems beyond gastrointestinal tract disturbances. Globally, over 3.5 billion people are infected with intestinal worms, of which 1.47 billion are with roundworm, 1.3 billion people with hookworm and 1.05 billion with whipworm. School children aged 5 - 15 years suffer the highest infection rate and worm burden that attributes to poor sanitation and hygiene. About 400 million school-age children are infected with roundworm, whipworm and hookworm worldwide, a large proportion of whom are found in the East Asia region (Cambodia, China, Lao PDR, Thailand and Vietnam). These parasites consume nutrients from children they infect, thus retarding their physical development. They destroy tissues and organs, cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea, intestinal obstruction, anaemia, ulcers and other health problems. All of these consequences of infection can slow cognitive development and thus impair learning. De-worming school children by anthelmintic drug treatment is a curative approach for expelling the heavy worm load. However, drug therapy alone is only a short-term measure of reducing worm infection and re-infection is frequent. Control measures through improved sanitation, hygiene and de-worming are needed to prevent infection and re-infection. UNICEF has supported many governments in this (and other) regions to assist in the provision of water supply and sanitary facilities and intensive hygiene education in many schools through the Water, Environment and Sanitation (WES) programme. The UNICEF supported school sanitation and hygiene education (SSHE) programme, and other programmes, could effectively enhance behaviour change in children to break the routes of worm transmission and other waterborne diseases."

            "abstract": "Transmission of Schistosoma mansoni depends on fecal eggs reaching water, but the way this happens is poorly understood. We studied the role of hygienic bathing after defecation in the contamination of water with S. mansoni eggs. Individuals in an endemic community in Northern Senegal (n=991) were examined for S. mansoni infection and a random sample (22%) was interviewed about stool disposal practices and hygienic behavior. We assessed the presence and viability of S. mansoni eggs adhering to the peri-anal region of 13 infected volunteers, by counting the miracidia in the water they had used for hygienic washing; for 10 of them (77%) miracidia were demonstrated. From the population infection distribution, average number of defecations per day, proportion of individuals bathing after defecation, and association between miracidial counts and infection intensity, we calculated a daily population miracidial output of approximately 30,000 through hygienic bathing. For comparison, one complete stool reaching the water was calculated to yield approximately 2500 miracidia. Thus, 12 individuals in this population should defecate into the water every day to produce the same number of miracidia as through hygienic bathing. Our results suggest a major role of hygienic bathing after defecation in the transmission of S. mansoni."

However, the association between etiology-specific diarrhea and growth has not been comprehensively evaluated. We tested diarrheal stools collected from the Performance of Rotavirus and Oral Polio Vaccines in Developing Countries study from 2011 to 2013 in Dhaka, Bangladesh, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction for a broad range of enteropathogens to characterize diarrhea etiology and examine the association between etiology-specific diarrhea and linear growth and systemic inflammation. Pathogen-specific burdens of diarrhea were determined using attributable fractions. Linear regression was used to examine associations of pathogen-specific diarrhea with length-for-age z scores (LAZ) and serum C-reactive protein. There was no relationship between all-cause diarrhea and length at 12 months (change in 12-month LAZ per episode, -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.06, 0.03). However, Cryptosporidium (change in 12-month LAZ per attributable episode, -0.23, 95% CI: -0.50, 0.03), Campylobacter jejuni/coli (change of -0.16, 95% CI: -0.32, -0.01), and Shigella/enteroinvasive Escherichia coli diarrhea (change of -0.12, 95% CI: -0.26, 0.03) were associated with linear growth deficits. Diarrhea attributable to C. jejuni/coli and Shigella/enteroinvasive E. coli were associated with elevated C-reactive protein.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Helminth and protozoan infections affect more than 1 billion children globally. Improving water quality, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition could be more sustainable control strategies for parasite infections than mass drug administration, while providing other quality of life benefits.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      We enrolled geographic clusters of pregnant women in rural western Kenya into a cluster-randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105) that tested 6 interventions: water treatment, improved sanitation, handwashing with soap, combined water treatment, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH), improved nutrition, and combined WSH and nutrition (WSHN). We assessed intervention effects on parasite infections by measuring Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, hookworm, and Giardia duodenalis among children born to the enrolled pregnant women (index children) and their older siblings. After 2 years of intervention exposure, we collected stool specimens from 9,077 total children aged 2 to 15 years in 622 clusters, including 2,346 children in an active control group (received household visits but no interventions), 1,117 in the water treatment arm, 1,160 in the sanitation arm, 1,141 in the handwashing arm, 1,064 in the WSH arm, 1,072 in the nutrition arm, and 1,177 in the WSHN arm. In the control group, 23% of children were infected with A. lumbricoides, 1% with T. trichiura, 2% with hookworm, and 39% with G. duodenalis. The analysis included 4,928 index children (median age in years: 2) and 4,149 older siblings (median age in years: 5); study households had an average of 5 people, <10% had electricity access, and >90% had dirt floors. Compared to the control group, Ascaris infection prevalence was lower in the water treatment arm (prevalence ratio [PR]: 0.82 [95% CI 0.67, 1.00], p = 0.056), the WSH arm (PR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.63, 0.96], p = 0.021), and the WSHN arm (PR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.64, 0.96], p = 0.017). We did not observe differences in Ascaris infection prevalence between the control group and the arms with the individual interventions sanitation (PR: 0.89 [95% CI 0.73, 1.08], p = 0.228), handwashing (PR: 0.89 [95% CI 0.73, 1.09], p = 0.277), or nutrition (PR: 86 [95% CI 0.71, 1.05], p = 0.148). Integrating nutrition with WSH did not provide additional benefit. Trichuris and hookworm were rarely detected, resulting in imprecise effect estimates. No intervention reduced Giardia. Reanalysis of stool samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed the reductions in Ascaris infections measured by microscopy in the WSH and WSHN groups. Trial limitations included imperfect uptake of targeted intervention behaviors, limited power to detect effects on rare parasite infections, and that it was not feasible to blind participants and sample collectors to treatment status. However, lab technicians and data analysts were blinded to treatment status. The trial was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Integration of improved water quality, sanitation, and handwashing could contribute to sustainable control strategies for Ascaris infections, particularly in similar settings with recent or ongoing deworming programs. Combining nutrition with WSH did not provide further benefits, and water treatment alone was similarly effective to integrated WSH. Our findings provide new evidence that drinking water should be given increased attention as a transmission pathway for Ascaris.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01704105."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Diarrhea is one of the leading causes of mortality in young children. Diarrheal pathogens are transmitted via the fecal-oral route, and for children the majority of this transmission is thought to occur within the home. However, very few studies have documented enteric pathogens within households of low-income countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      The presence of molecular markers for three enteric viruses (enterovirus, adenovirus, and rotavirus), seven Escherichia coli virulence genes (ECVG), and human-specific Bacteroidales was assessed in hand rinses and household stored drinking water in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. Using a matched case-control study design, we examined the relationship between contamination of hands and water with these markers and child diarrhea. We found that the presence of ECVG in household stored water was associated with a significant decrease in the odds of a child within the home having diarrhea (OR = 0.51; 95% confidence interval 0.27-0.93). We also evaluated water management and hygiene behaviors. Recent hand contact with water or food was positively associated with detection of enteric pathogen markers on hands, as was relatively lower volumes of water reportedly used for daily hand washing. Enteropathogen markers in stored drinking water were more likely found among households in which the markers were also detected on hands, as well as in households with unimproved water supply and sanitation infrastructure.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of enteric pathogen genes and the human-specific Bacteroidales fecal marker in stored water and on hands suggests extensive environmental contamination within homes both with and without reported child diarrhea. Better stored water quality among households with diarrhea indicates caregivers with sick children may be more likely to ensure safe drinking water in the home. Interventions to increase the quantity of water available for hand washing, and to improve food hygiene, may reduce exposure to enteric pathogens in the domestic environment."

The children's parents are all carpet-making workers who live in an environment with crowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and contaminated water. Anthropometric data, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, were collected over a 9-month period. Morbidity data were gathered from maternal reports, and a subsample of children's stools were examined for gastrointestinal parasites. In a comparison of current growth status and growth velocity for children with and without diarrhea and respiratory infections, it is found that body weight is most affected by infections, particularly for children under 24 months of age. For a subsample of children whose stools were tested for parasites, there is a statistically significant association between stunting (low height-for-age) and the presence of a protozoan gastrointestinal parasite. It is concluded that although growth faltering is associated with diarrhea and respiratory infections, the impact of these infections is of less importance for long-term linear growth retardation than is infection by protozoan gastrointestinal parasites."

The pH of recovery faecal specimens was significantly lower than that in diarrhoeal faecal specimens. There was a parallel between the decrease in number of anaerobes and fluctuation in the amount of SCFA, showing that the drastic reduction of VFA accompanying decrease of anaerobes during the diarrhoeal state, and the rise in pH thought to arise from these facts, result in an increase of water content."

Immunoglobulin (Ig) A mediates host-microbial homeostasis in the intestine, and acutely undernourished children have been shown to have altered IgA recognition of the fecal microbiota. We sought to determine whether chronic undernutrition (stunting) or intestinal inflammation were associated with antibody recognition of the microbiota using two geographically distinct populations from the Afribiota project. Fecal bacteria from 200 children between 2 and 5 years old in Antananarivo, Madagascar, and Bangui, Central African Republic (CAR), were sorted into IgA-positive (IgA+) and IgA-negative (IgA-) populations by flow cytometry and subsequently characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine IgA-bacterial targeting.

The main aim of this paper is to identify the sociodemographic, nutritional, and health-related factors associated with stunting, wasting, and underweight in children under the age of two years in Pakistan. Secondary data analysis was performed based on the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, 2012⁻2013. The analysis was limited to children under the age of two years (n = 984). Analysis was done using bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression. The incidence of stunting, wasting, and underweight in children was 28.3%, 12.1%, and 27.9%, respectively. The odds of stunting, wasting, and underweight increased with the child's age. The odds of stunting and underweight increased with the mother's low body mass index, low access to information, high birth order of child, consanguineous marriages, father's low education, rural settlement, poor toilet facilities, and low vitamin A consumption. The odds of wasting increased in children who were not being breastfed, but no significant relation was seen with stunting and underweight. There is a need to improve child nutritional status in Pakistan by addressing issues such as poverty, low parental education, low micronutrient intake, and targeting provinces where undernutrition was found to be higher."

            "title": "On the compressional rheology of fresh faeces: Evidence for improving community scale sanitation through localised dewatering.",
            "abstract": "Non-sewered sanitation is currently dependant upon pit latrine emptying, the safety of which is compromised by the high costs of faecal sludge transport to centralised treatment facilities. Transport in turn is hindered by the complex rheology of pit latrine sludge. This study therefore characterised the compressional rheology of fresh faeces and modelled the implications for passive (gravity) or mechanical (forced) solid/liquid separation. This informs on the viability of decentralising dewatering for more efficient volume reduction and improving the economics of transportation. The gel point (ϕg) is the solids concentration where the material has a networked structure and signifies the point when mechanical intervention is required for further solid-liquid separation. For fresh faeces, ϕg ranged between 6.3 and 15.6% total solids (TS) concentration. This is significantly higher than the ϕg observed for wastewater sludge at centralised facilities, and it implies that passive gravity driven processes can suffice to improve localised dewatering. The kinetics of passive sedimentation of faecal material were modelled and illustrate thickening from 3 to 10% TS concentration in <0.5 h. This highlights that early intervention to thicken faeces while fresh can improve solid/liquid separation efficiency. Filtration of fresh faeces was characterised by lengthy cake filtration times and comparably short compression times, more similar to mineral slurries than to wastewater sludge. Consequently, fresh faeces presented improved dewatering characteristics, supporting higher final cake solids concentrations and improved dewatering kinetics. By complementing thickening with 300 kPa filtration, a 1.4 cm thick 25% TS product could be achieved in <24 h. Investigation of matrix properties highlighted that increased conductivity (e.g. exposure to urine) negatively influenced dewaterability, an effect which could be mitigated by introducing solid-liquid separation earlier. The thermodynamically favourable compressional rheology of fresh faeces has identified that focussing on localised dewatering could radically improve the economics of faecal sludge management, primarily through reducing transport costs."

            "abstract": "Over half of the almost 1 billion people who practice open defecation live in India. While access to community water sources has improved in rural India, few households have on-site piped water. Although a primary motivation for water, sanitation and hygiene improvements is associated improvements in health, there is mixed evidence of effective interventions, especially in India. We conducted a matched cohort study to evaluate a combined intervention, where household piped water connections were contingent on community-wide household toiletand bathing room construction, implemented in rural Odisha, India. Forty-five intervention villages were randomly selected from a list of those where the program was implemented, and matched to 45 control villages. We conducted surveys and observations, and collected stools and environmental samples (source water, drinking water, and rinses of children’s hands) between June 2015-October 2016 in households with a child under five (N=2398). Health surveillance included diarrhea, acute respiratory infection, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and anthropometry to assess undernutrition.Source water, drinking water, and children’s hands were assayed for fecal indicator bacteria, and select waterborne pathogens. Multilevel regression using generalized linear models was used to assess the effect of theintervention on WaSH coverage, availability and use; fecal environmental contamination; and child health. Compared to controls, intervention villages had substantially higher improved toilet coverage and use. Although the intervention was associated with higher access to piped water on the household premises, both study arms experienced intermittencies in water availability. Most source and drinking waters in both study armswere positive for E. coli, and there was no intervention effect on E. coli. in source water, drinking water, or on children’s hands. However, the intervention substantially reduced the prevalence of S. dysenteria and S. flexneri in source water (aRR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.97). Similarly, there was no intervention effect on child diarrhea or respiratory infection. However, compared to the control, children in intervention villages had lower odds of helminthiasis (aOR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.00) and improved HAZ (+0.17, 95% CI: 0.03-0.31). Future research should focus on the pathways through which these mixed effects on fecal environmental contamination and health outcomes occur."

This paper presents the design and baseline survey results of an ongoing school-based cluster-randomised controlled trial in Kagera region, NW Tanzania. The trial aims to determine whether the effect of routine deworming on the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura infections among school aged children can be sustained when combined with a behaviour change intervention promoting handwashing with water and soap.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      As part of the trial, a total of 16 schools were randomised to receive the intervention (N = 8) or as controls (N = 8).

The impact evaluation involves two cross-sectional surveys conducted at baseline and endline. The objectives of the baseline survey were: (i) to confirm whether the deworming campaign was successful, and identify and treat students still infected about 2 weeks after deworming, (ii) to document any baseline differences in STH prevalence between trial arms, and (iii) to assess handwashing behaviours, and access to water and sanitation at school and home.

Using univariable logistic regression, we examined differences between HIV-positive and HIV-negative households in regard to WASH practices. Among HIV-positive households, we explored the relationship between the length of time knowing their HIV status and GEMS enrollment. No statistically significant differences were apparent in the WASH characteristics among HIV-positive and HIV-negative households. However, we found differences in the WASH characteristics among HIV-positive households who were aware of their HIV status ≥ 30 days before enrollment compared with HIV-positive households who found out their status < 30 days before enrollment or thereafter. Significantly more households aware of their HIV-positive status before enrollment reported treating their drinking water (odds ratio [OR] confidence interval [CI]: 2.34 [1.12, 4.86]) and using effective water treatment methods (OR [CI]: 9.6 [3.09, 29.86]), and had better drinking water storage practices.

Results showed that children had an average of two episodes per year and the incidence rate of diarrheal episodes defined as acute (< 14 d) and persistent (> or = 14 d) varied similarly with age. The peak incidence (episodes/child/year) of acute diarrhea (2.8) and persistent diarrhea (0.8) occurred in the 6-11 months age group. The data showed that an episode tended to be prolonged if the stool was loose/mucoid or bloody at onset. Aggregative adherent Escherichia coli was found significantly more often at onset in persistent than in acute episodes, whereas Shigella, Aeromonas, Giardia and toxigenic E. coli were isolated with less frequency in persistent than acute episodes.

Data-including hemoglobin concentration; anemia rate; and z scores of height for age, weight for age, and weight for height-were extracted and then analyzed using RevMan 5 software. Seventeen studies on YYB intervention, which showed significantly higher hemoglobin concentration (P < .01) and lower anemia rate (P < .01) in the intervention group compared to the control group, were included. In before-after studies, the prevalence of stunting (P < .01), underweight (P < .01), and wasting (P < .01) significantly decreased, whereas the z scores of weight for height increased (P < .01). However, no significant effect was observed on the z scores of height for age and weight for age. The hemoglobin concentration was higher after using YYB, and the prevalence of anemia, stunting, underweight, and wasting of infants and young children decreased in poor rural regions in China.

Further, the analyses show that the prevalence of stunting will decline to 14·3 % and wasting to 8·4 % by 2030.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A remarkable decrease in the prevalence of stunting and underweight has been observed over the last 15 years. Nepal is likely to achieve the nutritional targets for stunting but not for wasting by 2030.

Knowledge gaps still exist, namely, when and which WASH factors are determinants for growth faltering, and when WASH interventions are most effective at improving growth. This study drew cross-sectional data from a longitudinal cohort study and used hierarchical regression analyses to assess associations between WASH factors: water index, sanitation, hygiene index, and growth: height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ) at 1, 6, and 12 months postpartum among infants a priori born healthy in Soweto, Johannesburg. Household access to sanitation facilities that were not safely managed was associated with a decrease in HAZ scores at 1 month (β = -2.24) and 6 months (β = -0.96); a decrease in WAZ at 1 month (β = -1.21), 6 months (β = -1.57), and 12 months (β = -1.92); and finally, with WHZ scores at 12 months (β = -1.94). Counterintuitively, poorer scores on the hygiene index were associated with an increase at 1 month for both HAZ (β = 0.53) and WAZ (β = 0.44). Provision of safely managed sanitation at household and community levels may be required before improvements in growth-related outcomes are obtained."

This follow-up cohort study (Lulun Project II) aimed to test whether the growth effect remained in the egg intervention group compared with the control group after approximately 2 years. Mothers or caregivers from the Lulun Project were recontacted and recruited for this study. Enumerators collected data on socio-economic and demographic factors, 24-hr frequency of dietary intakes, morbidities, and anthropometric measures of height, weight, and head circumference using World Health Organization protocols. Statistical analyses followed the same analytical plan as Lulun Project, applying generalized linear models and regression modelling to test group differences in height-for-age z (HAZ) from LAZ at Lulun Project endline, and structural equation modelling for mediation. One hundred thirty-five mother-child dyads were included in Lulun II, with 11% losses to follow-up from endline Lulun Project. Growth faltering across all children was evident with HAZ -2.07 ± 0.91 and a stunting prevelance of 50%. Regression modelling showed no difference between egg and control groups for the HAZ outcome and other anthropometric outcomes, and significant declines in HAZ from endline Lulun Project in the egg intervention are compared with control groups. Current dietary egg intake, however, was associated with reduced growth faltering in HAZ from Lulun Project endline to Lulun Project II, independent of group assignment and through mediation, explaining 8.8% of the total effect. Findings suggest the need for a longer intervention period and ongoing nutrition support to young children during early childhood."

Efforts have been made to explore the impact of diarrhea on bacterial communities in the human gut, but a thorough understanding has been impeded by inadequate resolution in bacterial identification and the examination of only few etiological agents. Here, by profiling an extended region of the 16S rRNA gene in the fecal microbiome, we aimed to elucidate the nature of gut microbiome perturbations during the early phase of infectious diarrhea caused by various etiological agents in Vietnamese children. Fecal samples from 145 diarrheal cases with a confirmed infectious etiology before antimicrobial therapy and 54 control subjects were analyzed. We found that the diarrheal fecal microbiota could be robustly categorized into 4 microbial configurations that either generally resembled or were highly divergent from a healthy state. Factors such as age, nutritional status, breastfeeding, and the etiology of the infection were significantly associated with these microbial community structures. We observed a consistent elevation of Fusobacterium mortiferum, Escherichia, and oral microorganisms in all diarrheal fecal microbiome configurations, proposing similar mechanistic interactions, even in the absence of global dysbiosis. We additionally found that Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum was significantly depleted during dysenteric diarrhea regardless of the etiological agent, suggesting that further investigations into the use of this species as a dysentery-orientated probiotic therapy are warranted. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the complex influence of infectious diarrhea on gut microbiome and identify new opportunities for therapeutic interventions."

            "abstract": "AbstractIt has recently been hypothesized that exposure to livestock constitutes a significant risk factor for diarrhea and environmental enteric disorder in young children, which may significantly contribute to undernutrition. To date, though, very little research has documented the extent of exposure to animal feces and whether this exposure is associated with child anthropometry in large samples and diverse settings. This study investigates these issues using data from the Alive and Thrive study conducted in rural areas of Ethiopia, Bangladesh, and Vietnam. These surveys used spot-checks to collect data on proxies of hygiene behaviors such as the cleanliness of mothers, young children, and the homestead environment, including the presence of animal feces. Animal feces were visible in 38-42% of household compounds across the three countries and were positively associated with household livestock ownership and negatively associated with maternal and child cleanliness. One-sided tests from multivariate least squares models for children 6-24 months of age indicate that the presence of animal feces is significantly and negatively associated with child height-for-age z scores in Ethiopia (β = -0.22), Bangladesh (β = -0.13), and in a pooled sample (β = -0.11), but not in Vietnam. There is also suggestive evidence that animal feces may be positively associated with diarrhea symptoms in Bangladesh. The results in this article, therefore, contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that animal ownership may pose a significant risk to child nutrition and health outcomes in developing countries."

The nutritional status of each child was evaluated using Z-scores of height/supine length-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ). The effects of sex and side on deciduous dental emergence were not statistically significant. Partial correlation indicates that the number of emerged teeth (T) was more strongly correlated with height than with other anthropometric variables. In most age groups, the stunted boys and girls (HAZ <-2) had fewer emerged teeth than nonstunted age peers (HAZ >-2). The mean T in underweight children was also less than that of the normal children, with a few exceptions. The stunted children have a significantly greater likelihood of delayed emergence of deciduous dentition. Measures of linear growth status are more closely related to dental development than measures of growth in mass. The findings indicate that even moderate undernutrition can delay deciduous tooth emergence."

However, the data of the multiple anthropometric failures combinations of these conventional indicators are scant. This study attempted to estimate the overall burden of undernutrition among children under 5 years old, using the composite index of anthropometric failure (CIAF), and to explore the correlates. The study used secondary data from the Bangladesh demographic and health surveys (BDHS), undertaken in 2014. CIAF provides an overall prevalence of undernutrition, which gives six mutually exclusive anthropometric measurements of height-for- age, height-for-weight, and weight-for-age. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the correlates of CIAF. The overall prevalence of undernutrition using the CIAF was 48.3% (95% CI [47.1%, 49.5%]) among the children under 5 years old. The prevalence of anthropometric failure due to a combination of both stunting and underweight was 18.2%, wasting and underweight was 5.5%, and wasting, underweight, and stunting was 5.7%. The odds of CIAF were higher among young maternal age, having the poorest socio-economic status, living in rural areas, higher order of birth, and received no vaccination compared with other counterparts. In Bangladesh, one out of two children has undernutrition, which is preventing the potential of the millions of children. Mothers who gave birth before age 20 living in the rural areas with belonging to lower socio-economic status and whose children had a higher order of birth and receive no vaccination were observed as the main determinants of undernutrition. Nutrition sensitive interventions along with social protection programmes are crucial to deal the underlying causes of undernutrition."

This study provides the first analysis of risk factors for intensity of STH infection, as determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR), examining a broad range of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and environmental factors, among communities in Manufahi District, Timor-Leste.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A baseline cross-sectional survey of 18 communities was undertaken as part of a cluster randomised controlled trial, with additional identically-collected data from six other communities. qPCR was used to assess STH infection from stool samples, and questionnaires administered to collect WASH, demographic, and socioeconomic data. Environmental information was obtained from open-access sources and linked to infection outcomes. Mixed-effects multinomial logistic regression was undertaken to assess risk factors for intensity of Necator americanus and Ascaris infection.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      2152 participants provided stool and questionnaire information for this analysis. In adjusted models incorporating WASH, demographic and environmental variables, environmental variables were generally associated with infection intensity for both N. americanus and Ascaris spp. Precipitation (in centimetres) was associated with increased risk of moderate-intensity (adjusted relative risk [ARR] 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-19.3) and heavy-intensity (ARR 6.6; 95% CI 3.1-14.1) N. americanus infection, as was sandy-loam soil around households (moderate-intensity ARR 2.1; 95% CI 1.0-4.3; heavy-intensity ARR 2.7; 95% CI 1.6-4.5; compared to no infection). For Ascaris, alkaline soil around the household was associated with reduced risk of moderate-intensity infection (ARR 0.21; 95% CI 0.09-0.51), and heavy-intensity infection (ARR 0.04; 95% CI 0.01-0.25). Few WASH risk factors were significant.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this high-prevalence setting, strong risk associations with environmental factors indicate that anthelmintic treatment alone will be insufficient to interrupt STH transmission, as conditions are favourable for ongoing environmental transmission. Integrated STH control strategies should be explored as a priority."

            "abstract": "Malnutrition is the leading cause of poor child health in Ethiopia, and progress to avert it is unacceptably slow. In addition, little is known about the magnitude and factors associated with concurrent wasting and stunting (WaSt). Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with WaSt, wasting, stunting and underweight among children 6-59 months in Kersa Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Ethiopia. Data from a total of 1091 children and their parents' were analysed from a cross-sectional study. Household questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were used for data collection. Height-for-age, weight-for-height and weight-for-age indices are expressed as standard deviation units from the mean for the reference group. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with WaSt, wasting, stunting and underweight. Statistical significance was declared at p < 0.05. The prevalence of indicators of malnutrition was WaSt (5.8%), wasting (16.8%), stunting (53.9%) and underweight (36.9%). Children aged 6-17 months had a higher odds of wasting (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-2.75) compared with those aged 36-59 months, whereas children aged 18-35 months (aOR 2.4, 95% CI 1.65-3.47) and 36-59 months (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.07-2.37) had higher odds of stunting compared with those aged 6-17 months. Similarly, children aged 18-35 months (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.07-2.37) and 36-59 months (aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.52-3.10) had higher odds of underweight compared with children aged 6-17 months. Households that did not treat drinking water at point of use were at higher odds of WaSt (aOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.16-9.27) and stunting (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.31-2.85) compared with those who did treat drinking water. Boys were more likely to be WaSt, wasted, stunted and underweight. Cough was associated with WaSt, wasting and underweight. Furthermore, maternal education, maternal occupation and maternal age were significantly associated with wasting. Maternal body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5 kg/m2 and maternal BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2 were associated with child stunting. In Kersa, the prevalence of WaSt, wasting, stunting and underweight is very high and requires urgent public health intervention. This study highlights point-of-use water treatment, maternal education, hygiene and sanitation, child health service utilization and maternal BMI as important areas to improve to target child malnutrition. Furthermore, a community-based programmatic and policy direction for early identification and management of WaSt in addition to other indicators of malnutrition is recommended."

            "abstract": "Poultry production in low income countries provides households with nutrient-rich meat and egg products, as well as cash income. However, traditional production systems present potential health and nutrition risks because poultry scavenging around household compounds may increase children's exposure to livestock-related pathogens. Data from a cross-sectional survey were analysed to examine associations between poultry, water, sanitation, and hygiene practices, and anthropometric indicators in children (6-59 months; n = 3,230) in Burkina Faso. Multilevel regression was used to account for the hierarchical nature of the data. The prevalence of stunting and wasting in children 6-24 months was 19% and 17%, respectively, compared with a prevalence of 26% and 6%, respectively, in children 25-60 months. Over 90% of households owned poultry, and chicken faeces were visible in 70% of compounds. Caregivers reported that 3% of children consumed eggs during a 24-hr recall. The presence of poultry faeces was associated with poultry flock size, poultry-husbandry and household hygiene practices. Having an improved water source and a child visibly clean was associated with higher height-for-age z scores (HAZ). The presence of chicken faeces was associated with lower weight-for-height z scores, and no associations were found with HAZ. Low levels of poultry flock size and poultry consumption in Burkina Faso suggest there is scope to expand production and improve diets in children, including increasing chicken and egg consumption. However, to minimize potential child health risks associated with expanding informal poultry production, research is required to understand the mechanisms through which cohabitation with poultry adversely affects child health and design interventions to minimize these risks."

The issue is not about choosing between addressing undernutrition in the poor versus overnutrition in the affluent. We must recognize that the interventions required to address stunting are different from those needed to reduce underweight and wasting. In most developing regions, there is a coexistence between underweight and stunting in infants and children, while in the adult population it may be overweight and stunting. Malnutrition in all its forms refers to both underweight and overweight. Underweight is defined by a low weight-for-age, a child is underweight because of wasting (low weight-for-height) or stunting (low length-for-age). Stunting refers to low height-for-age independent of their weight-for-age, some stunted children may have excess weight for their stature length. Overweight is excess weight-for-length/-height or high-BMI-for-age. The prevention of nutrition-related chronic diseases is a life-long process that starts in fetal life and continues throughout infancy and later stages of life. It requires promoting healthy diets and active living at each stage. The agenda requires that we tackle malnutrition in all its forms."

The ETEC attach to the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and release substances that affect the normal functioning of the tract, thereby resulting in diarrhea, and subsequently millions of deaths everyday, particularly in children. The prevention of the spread of this strain of diarrheagenic E. coli depends on ensuring appropriate sanitary measures; hand-washing and proper preparation of food; chlorination of water supplies; and appropriate sewage treatment and disposal.

We link data from four rounds of the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey to high-resolution climate data to measure exposure to rainfall and temperature in utero and during early life. We then estimate a set of multivariate regression models to understand how weather conditions impact child stunting, an indicator of sustained early life undernutrition. We find that greater rainfall during the rainy seasons in early life is associated with greater height for age. In addition, higher temperatures in utero, particularly during the first and third trimesters, and more rainfall during the third trimester, are positively associated with severe stunting, though stunting decreases with temperature in early life. We find potential evidence for a number of pathways underlying the weather-child nutrition relationship including agricultural livelihoods, heat stress, infectious disease transmission, and women's time use during pregnancy. These findings illuminate the complex pathways through which climate change may influence child health and should motivate additional research focused on identifying the causal mechanisms underlying these links."

Parasitic prevalence and intensity rates amongst groups of urban residents having similar socio-economic status and housing, but different excreta disposal technologies, were compared. In Gaborone, there was no evidence of a difference in intestinal parasitism between those using aqua privies and having access to public taps and those in identical houses enjoying flush toilets, in-house water connections and showers. In Ndola, the group with sewered aqua privies had larger houses, cleaner toilets, better water supplies, longer residence and more people in paid employment than the groups using pit latrines or communal flush toilets. Despite this, the sewered aqua privy users were not found to be different from the other groups with regard to hookworm and protozoal infection but had significantly higher Ascaris infection rates. In Kumasi, despite the differences in toilet type--from squalid communal aqua privies, through often fouled bucket latrines to well-maintained flush toilet systems--and despite also the differences in water provision, no evidence was obtained of any differences in intestinal parasitism between the groups studied. These findings suggest that the provision of superior water and sanitation facilities to a small cluster of houses, or to houses scattered through an area, may not protect those families from infection if the over-all level of faecal contamination of the environment is high.

Data about the children and their mothers, caregivers and family conditions was acquired using unified questionnaire, and the length/height and weight of each child were measured using unified instruments. The prevalence of undernutrition among children was evaluated using the length/height for age, weight for age, weight for length/height, and body mass index for age z scores, which were computed according to the 2006 and 2007 WHO Child Growth Standards.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting among the 5529 children were 4.4% (241), 3.9% (217), and 4.0% (221), respectively. The significant associated factors on higher risks of undernutrition in the children were low birth weight, maternal gestational weight gain <10 kg (stunting); low birth weight, maternal gestational weight gain <10 kg, ethnicity of caregivers being minority, large family size (underweight); low birth weight, ethnicity of caregivers being minority, large family size (wasting).

Epidemiological surveys seeking to evaluate the frequency of the various intestinal helminths are usually intermittent, few in number, and especially difficult to compare because of the different coprological techniques used. However this may be, the respective prevalence of these worms depends on geographical, climatic, economic, and human conditions. Their effect on health is not negligible, especially on children's health and in particular when malnutrition also occurs.

Multivariate regression analysis assessed the association between faecal and nitrate contamination and drinking water sources household drinking water adjusted for wealth, education level, type of water sources and type of sanitation facilities. The survey observed widespread faecal contamination in both sources for drinking water (89.2%, 95%CI: 86.9-91.5%; n=720) and household drinking water (67.1%, 95%CI: 64.1-70.1%; n=917) as measured by Escherichia coli. This was despite widespread improved drinking water source coverage (85.3%) and commonly self-reported boiling practices (82.2%). E.coli concentration levels in household drinking water were associated with wealth, education levels of a household head, and type of water source (i.e. vender water or local sources). Following the proposed SDG definition for Target 6.1 (water) and 6.2 (sanitation), the estimated proportion of households with access to safely managed drinking water and sanitation was 8.5% and 45.5%, respectively in the study areas, indicating substantial difference from improved drinking water (82.2%) and improved sanitation coverage (70.9%) as per the MDGs targets. The greatest contamination and risk factors were found in the poorest households indicating the urgent need for targeted and effective interventions here. There is suggested evidence that sub-surface leaching from on-site sanitation adversely impacts on drinking water sources, which underscores the need for further technical assistance in promoting latrine construction.

There are compelling intrinsic and moral reasons to ensure that children attain their optimal growth potential facilitated via promotion of healthy living conditions. Investments in efforts to ensure that children's growth is not faltered also have substantial instrumental benefits in terms of cognitive and economic development. Using the case of India, we critique three prevailing approaches to reducing undernutrition among children: an over-reliance on macroeconomic growth as a potent policy instrument, a disproportionate focus on interpreting undernutrition as a demand-side problem and an over-reliance on unintegrated single-factorial (one at a time) approaches to policy and research. Using existing evidence, we develop a case for support-led policy approach with a focus on integrated and structural factors to addressing the problem of undernutrition among children in India. Key messages Eliminating child undernutrition is important from an intrinsic perspective and offers considerable instrumental benefits to individual and society. Evidence suggests that an exclusive reliance on a growth-mediated strategy to eliminate stunting needs to be reconsidered, suggesting the need for a substantial support-led strategy. Interpreting and addressing undernutrition as a demand-side problem with proximal single-factorial interventions is futile. There is an urgent need to develop interventions that address the broader structural and upstream causes of child undernutrition."

This study explores the relationship between alternative indicators of poverty and childhood undernutrition in developing countries within the context of a multi-national cohort study (Young Lives). Approximately 2000 children in each of four countries - Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam - had their heights measured and were weighed when they were aged between 6 and 17 months (survey one) and again between 4.5 and 5.5 years (survey two). The anthropometric outcomes of stunted, underweight and wasted were calculated using World Health Organization 2006 reference standards. Maximum-likelihood probit estimation was employed to model the relationship within each country and survey between alternative measures of living standards (principally a wealth index developed using principal components analysis) and each anthropometric outcome. An extensive set of covariates was incorporated into the models to remove as much individual heterogeneity as possible. The fully adjusted models revealed a negative and statistically significant coefficient on wealth for all outcomes in all countries, with the exception of the outcome of wasted in India (Andhra Pradesh) and Vietnam (survey one) and the outcome of underweight in Vietnam (surveys one and two). In survey one, the partial effects of wealth on the probabilities of stunting, being underweight and wasting was to reduce them by between 1.4 and 5.1 percentage points, 1.0 and 6.4 percentage points, and 0.3 and 4.5 percentage points, respectively, with each unit (10%) increase in wealth. The partial effects of wealth on the probabilities of anthropometric outcomes were larger in the survey two models. In both surveys, children residing in the lowest wealth quintile households had significantly increased probabilities of being stunted in all four study countries and of being underweight in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh) and Peru in comparison to children residing in the highest wealth quintile households. Random effects probit models confirmed the statistical significance of increased wealth in reducing the probability of being stunted and underweight across all four study countries.

Most of the water supply systems in urban and rural area of Nepal do not have basic water treatment facilities. This has resulted in frequent reports of fecal contamination in drinking water and outbreaks of waterborne diseases. The purpose of this study was to find out the burden of diarrhoeal diseases at different scenario of water supply system and sanitation status in Nepalese context.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was conducted in four different districts of Nepal analyzing six different scenarios based on availability of water supply and sanitation status. Village Development Committees (VDCs) and community selection was made purposively and 360 households, 60 from each scenario were selected conveniently to achieve the required number. Within the selected household, the head of the household or any member above 18 years of age was interviewed using a structured questionnaire.

However, the roles of health education and sanitation in disease control have been controversial, especially in the wake of recent advances in safe and effective oral drugs. This article has reviewed the various health education and sanitation interventions around the world to determine what roles they have played in the past relative to other intervention strategies and the role they have to play in future control efforts. It appears clear-cut from the review, that while chemotherapy has been and will remain the best option for morbidity control, sanitation has an important role to play not only to sustain the benefits of chemotherapy but also to protect the uninfected. Health education that is effective, simple and low-cost remains the only tool for creating the enabling environment for both chemotherapy and sanitation to thrive."

After completion of the intervention, data were collected from 100 beneficiary schools and 100 matched comparison schools in 5-6 sessions over a 14-month period. Data collection included roll calls to assess absenteeism and interviews with a subset of pupils to assess recent absence and disease symptoms. The odds of pupils being absent at roll call were 23% higher in beneficiary schools than in comparison schools (odds ratio [OR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.06, 1.42). The odds of pupils reporting being absent due to diarrhea (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.94) or having had diarrhea (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.85) or respiratory infection symptoms (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86) in the past week were lower in beneficiary schools compared with comparison schools. We found that a school-based WASH intervention can have a positive effect on reducing rates of illness, as well as absence due to diarrhea. However, we did not find evidence that these health impacts led to a reduction in overall absence. Higher absence rates are less likely attributable to the intervention than the result of an imbalance in unobserved confounders between study groups."

Therefore, the objective of the current study is to evaluate the prevalence of food insecurity in schoolchildren and to identify its social, demographic, and nutritional determinants in Tabriz, Iran. This cross-sectional study was conducted between April and September 2014 among 330 schoolchildren aged 7-11 years comprising 170 boys and 160 girls from ten public schools in Tabriz, Iran. Demographic and socioeconomic factors had been obtained from participants. Food security status was assessed by an eight-item U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Security Module previously validated for use in Iran. Dietary information was obtained by a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). In our findings, the prevalence of food insecurity among children was 30% with 29.1% being low food secure and 0.9% being very low food secure. Mean weight for age Z-score (WAZ) in the food insecure group was significantly lower than in the food secure group. The prevalence of food insecurity was more prevalent in boys (p = .006). Food insecure children had a significantly lower intake of energy, carbohydrate, protein, and meat (p < .001) and higher prevalence of wasting compared with their counterparts in the food secure group (p = .004). These results suggest a proportionally high prevalence of food insecurity in schoolchildren in Tabriz and its significant association with poor nutritional status and dietary habits. Our findings also ensures the necessity of nutritional support programs and nutritional education in Iranian low-income families to improve their overall health."

This paper assesses the effectiveness of SHEWA-B on changing behaviors and reducing diarrhea and respiratory illness among children < 5 years of age. We assessed behaviors at baseline in 2007 and after 6 months and 18 months by conducting structured observation of handwashing behavior in 500 intervention and 500 control households. In addition we conducted spot checks of water and sanitation facilities in 850 intervention and 850 control households. We also collected monthly data on diarrhea and respiratory illness from 500 intervention and 500 control households from October 2007 to September 2009. Participants washed their hands with soap < 3% of the time around food related events in both intervention and control households at baseline and after 18 months. Washing both hands with soap or ash after cleaning a child's anus increased from 22% to 36%, and no access to a latrine decreased from 10% to 6.8% from baseline to 18 months. The prevalence of diarrhea and respiratory illness, among children <5 years of age were similar in intervention and control communities throughout the study. This large scale sanitation, hygiene and water improvement programme resulted in improvements in a few of its targeted behaviors, but these modest behavior changes have not yet resulted in a measurable reduction in childhood diarrhea and respiratory illness."

Intestinal inflammatory response and permeability were assessed using fecal S100A12 and alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT), respectively. The cutoff <-1SD for weight-for-length and length-for-age was used to define wasting and stunting. Multivariable linear regression analysis explored if cumulative enteric parasitic infections explained variability of fecal biomarkers, after adjusting for potential confounders. Eighty infants were included. Giardia duodenalis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) were the most frequent parasites. The median (interquartile range) levels were 2.87 μg/g (2.41-3.92) for S100A12 and 165.1 μg/g (66.0-275.6) for A1AT. Weak evidence of association was found between S100A12 levels and G. duodenalis (p = 0.080) and STH infections (p = 0.089), and between A1AT levels and parasitic infection of any etiology (p = 0.089), at 24-months of age. Significant associations between A1AT levels and wasting (p = 0.006) and stunting (p = 0.044) were found. Previous parasitic infections were not associated with fecal biomarkers at 24 months of age. To summarize, previous asymptomatic parasitic infections showed no association with intestinal barrier dysfunction. Notwithstanding, a tendency toward increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker was observed for current G. duodenalis and STH infections, and increased levels of the permeability biomarker were significantly associated with stunting and wasting."

The prevalence of stunting, wasting and under-weight in children is particularly high in some mountain areas such as Meghalaya state in India, the western mountains and far-western hills of Nepal, Balochistan province in Pakistan, eastern Afghanistan, and Chin state in Myanmar. Food habits in the HKH region are changing. This has led to a deterioration in traditional mountain food systems with a decline in agrobiodiversity.

The present cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the association between anthropometric indices and cognitive performance in 6746 school-aged children (aged 6-12 years) of four Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia; Malaysia; Thailand; Vietnam. Cognitive performance (non-verbal intelligence quotient (IQ)) was measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices test or Test of Non-Verbal Intelligence, third edition (TONI-3). Height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) and BMI-for-age z-scores (BAZ) were used as anthropometric nutritional status indices. Data were weighted using age, sex and urban/rural weight factors to resemble the total primary school-aged population per country. Overall, 21% of the children in the four countries were underweight and 19% were stunted. Children with low WAZ were 3·5 times more likely to have a non-verbal IQ < 89 (OR 3·53 and 95% CI 3·52, 3·54). The chance of having a non-verbal IQ < 89 was also doubled with low BAZ and HAZ. In contrast, except for severe obesity, the relationship between high BAZ and IQ was less clear and differed per country. The odds of having non-verbal IQ levels < 89 also increased with severe obesity. In conclusion, undernourishment and non-verbal IQ are significantly associated in 6-12-year-old children. Effective strategies to improve nutrition in preschoolers and school-aged children can have a pronounced effect on cognition and, in the longer term, help in positively contributing to individual and national development."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 121 adults and 175 children during July 2002. Primary caretakers were interviewed during home visits to assess agricultural and sanitation resources, child feeding practices, and the nutritional status of their children aged 5 years and under. Through anthropometry, the prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting were determined: 30 per cent were underweight, 47 per cent were stunted, and 7 per cent were wasted. Predictors of undernutrition were analysed using logistic regression controlling for age, sex, and SES, and four major findings emerged. First, children in their second year of life were more likely to be underweight and stunted. Second, children who were introduced to foods early had an increased risk of being underweight. Third, up-to-date vaccinations were protective against stunting, while reports of having upper respiratory infections or other illness in the past month predicted underweight. Finally, living with non-biological parents significantly increased risk of stunting. Emphasis should be placed on current immunization, prolonging exclusive breastfeeding, and improving access to nutrient-rich foods among adopted children and their families via community-based nutrition interventions."

            "abstract": "Human hookworm, a soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection caused by either Necator americanus or Anclystoma duodenale, is a major cause of morbidity globally and predominantly affects the world's poorest populations. Transmitted primarily by larval invasion of exposed skin, the adults inhabit the host small intestine, where they consume host blood. The resultant chronic iron deficiency anemia can lead to stunted growth and cognitive deficits in children, reduced work capacity in adults, and a variety of pregnancy complications. Historically, successful STH elimination has only been achieved in regions with concomitant significant economic growth. Since 2001, control of the STHs has been attempted via single-dose mass deworming of at-risk school-aged and preschool-aged children within STH-endemic countries, with the goal of morbidity reduction. Research questioning this strategy has grown in recent years, and current studies are evaluating the effectiveness of novel deworming strategies, including multidrug regimens and expansion of deworming to entire communities. While footwear campaigns may be associated with reduced odds of hookworm infection, the evidence supporting the impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions upon hookworm is mixed. Progress towards a human hookworm vaccine continues, with promising results from recent Phase 1 trials and several others ongoing. Integrated STH control programs, which combine mass deworming with WASH interventions, are relatively unstudied but may be a promising advancement. Whether interruption of STH transmission can be achieved apart from significant economic growth remains unanswered, but likely the implementation of intensive, integrated control programs will be necessary to achieve that goal."

            "title": "Causal inference methods to study nonrandomized, preexisting development interventions.",
            "abstract": "Empirical measurement of interventions to address significant global health and development problems is necessary to ensure that resources are applied appropriately. Such intervention programs are often deployed at the group or community level. The gold standard design to measure the effectiveness of community-level interventions is the community-randomized trial, but the conditions of these trials often make it difficult to assess their external validity and sustainability. The sheer number of community interventions, relative to randomized studies, speaks to a need for rigorous observational methods to measure their impact. In this article, we use the potential outcomes model for causal inference to motivate a matched cohort design to study the impact and sustainability of nonrandomized, preexisting interventions. We illustrate the method using a sanitation mobilization, water supply, and hygiene intervention in rural India. In a matched sample of 25 villages, we enrolled 1,284 children <5 y old and measured outcomes over 12 mo. Although we found a 33 percentage point difference in new toilet construction [95% confidence interval (CI) = 28%, 39%], we found no impacts on height-for-age Z scores (adjusted difference = 0.01, 95% CI = -0.15, 0.19) or diarrhea (adjusted longitudinal prevalence difference = 0.003, 95% CI = -0.001, 0.008) among children <5 y old. This study demonstrates that matched cohort designs can estimate impacts from nonrandomized, preexisting interventions that are used widely in development efforts. Interpreting the impacts as causal, however, requires stronger assumptions than prospective, randomized studies."

            "abstract": "This paper explores the epidemiologic importance of dysentery with use of several community studies that demonstrate its prevalence and incidence as well as its association with pathogens, nutritional status, persistent diarrhea, and death. Results of these studies showed that while watery diarrhea was most prevalent in children aged 6-11 months, the prevalence of dysentery peaked between 18 and 23 months of age. Severely stunted children were found to have significantly prolonged episodes of dysentery. Shigella and persistent diarrhea were more frequent in children with dysentery than in those with nonbloody diarrhea. A striking feature was that watery diarrhea, dysentery, persistent diarrhea, and malnutrition each account for less than 5% of all deaths among children aged less than 5 years. However, persistent diarrhea in association with malnutrition causes 13% of deaths in children aged 0-4 years and 27% of deaths in those aged 1-4 years. These data suggest that a more balanced strategy for diarrheal control is required simply because most diarrheal deaths occur among malnourished children with prolonged diarrhea, which is mainly due to dysentery. Results of the studies also suggest that methods to control dysentery in the community should focus on improved hygiene and antimicrobial treatment with use of appropriate algorithms. Recognition of the synergism between dysentery and persistent diarrhea accompanied by malnutrition is crucial in formulating effective programs for control of diarrhea."

The Southeast Asia region is home to many wasted children, but wasting is not recognized as a public health problem and its epidemiology is yet to be fully examined. This analysis aimed to determine the burden of wasting, its predictors, and the level of wasting and stunting concurrence. Datasets from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in six countries in the region were analyzed. The pooled weighted prevalence for wasting and concurrent wasting and stunting among children 0-59 months in the six countries was 8.9%, 95% CI (8.0-9.9) and 1.6%, 95% CI (1.5-1.8), respectively. This prevalence is approximately 12-fold higher than the 0.7% prevalence of high-income countries; and translated into an absolute number of 1,088,747 children affected by wasting and 272,563 concurrent wasting and stunting. Wasting prevalence was 50 percent higher in the 0-23-month age group. Predictors for wasting included source of drinking water, wealth index, urban residence, child's age and history of illness and mother's body mass index. In conclusion, our analysis showed that wasting is a serious public health problem in the region that should be addressed urgently using both preventive and curative approaches."

In resource-poor settings, barriers such as inadequate budgets, lack of oversight, and competing priorities limit effective and sustained WASH service delivery in schools. We employed a cluster-randomized trial to examine if schools could improve WASH conditions within existing administrative structures. Seventy schools were divided into a control group and three intervention groups. All intervention schools received a budget for purchasing WASH-related items. One group received no further intervention. A second group received additional funding for hiring a WASH attendant and making repairs to WASH infrastructure, and a third group was given guides for student and community monitoring of conditions. Intervention schools made significant improvements in provision of soap and handwashing water, treated drinking water, and clean latrines compared with controls. Teachers reported benefits of monitoring, repairs, and a WASH attendant, but quantitative data of WASH conditions did not determine whether expanded interventions out-performed our budget-only intervention. Providing schools with budgets for WASH operational costs improved access to necessary supplies, but did not ensure consistent service delivery to students. Further work is needed to clarify how schools can provide WASH services daily."

Microbial source tracking (MST) assays may help to identify environmental routes of pathogen transmission although these assays have performed poorly in highly contaminated domestic settings, highlighting the importance of both diagnostic validation and understanding the context-specific ecological, physical, and sociodemographic factors driving the spread of fecal contamination. We assessed fecal contamination of compounds (clusters of 2-10 households that share sanitation facilities) in low-income neighborhoods of urban Maputo, Mozambique, using a set of MST assays that were validated with animal stool and latrine sludge from study compounds. We sampled five environmental compartments involved in fecal microbe transmission and exposure: compound water source, household stored water and food preparation surfaces, and soil from the entrance to the compound latrine and the entrances to each household. Each sample was analyzed by culture for the general fecal indicator Escherichia coli (cEC) and by real-time PCR for the E. coli molecular marker EC23S857, human-associated markers HF183/BacR287 and Mnif, and GFD, an avian-associated marker. We collected 366 samples from 94 households in 58 compounds. At least one microbial target (indicator organism or marker gene) was detected in 96% of samples (353/366), with both E. coli targets present in the majority of samples (78%). Human targets were frequently detected in soils (59%) and occasionally in stored water (17%) but seldom in source water or on food surfaces. The avian target GFD was rarely detected in any sample type but was most common in soils (4%). To identify risk factors of fecal contamination, we estimated associations with sociodemographic, meteorological, and physical sample characteristics for each microbial target and sample type combination using Bayesian censored regression for target concentration responses and Bayesian logistic regression for target detection status. Associations with risk factors were generally weak and often differed in direction between different targets and sample types, though relationships were somewhat more consistent for physical sample characteristics. Wet soils were associated with elevated concentrations of cEC and EC23S857 and odds of detecting HF183. Water storage container characteristics that expose the contents to potential contact with hands and other objects were weakly associated with human target detection. Our results describe a setting impacted by pervasive domestic fecal contamination, including from human sources, that was largely disconnected from the observed variation in socioeconomic and sanitary conditions. This pattern suggests that in such highly contaminated settings, transformational changes to the community environment may be required before meaningful impacts on fecal contamination can be realized."

Small size of the child at birth, childhood diarrhoea and male gender increased the likelihood of undernutrition in at least three of the surveys. Childhood undernutrition occurred concurrently with maternal overnutrition in some households.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The analysis reveals a slow decline of undernutrition among young children in Kenya over the last three decades. However, stunting and underweight still remain of public health significance. There is evidence of an emerging trend of a malnutrition double burden demonstrated by stunted and underweight children whose mothers are overweight."

A recent three-year longitudinal study investigated integrated school health and nutrition approaches in 30 government primary schools in southern Ethiopia. Here, we report on baseline associations between sanitation, hookworm infection, anemia, stunting, and wasting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In each school, the Schistosoma mansoni, S. haematobium, and soil-transmitted helminth infection intensities; blood hemoglobin concentrations; heights; and weights of approximately 125 students were assessed. Of these 125 students, approximately 20 were randomly selected for student WASH surveys. Of these 20, approximately 15 were randomly selected for household sanitation observations. School WASH was also assessed through a combination of observations and questions to the headteacher. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to compare household sanitation with hookworm infection (the other parasites being much less prevalent); and hookworm infection with anemia, stunting, and wasting.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Blood, stool, and urine samples were provided by 3,729 children, and student WASH and household WASH surveys were conducted with 596 and 448 of these students, respectively. Hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and S. mansoni infections had prevalences of 18%, 4.8%, 0.6%, and 0.3%, respectively, and no S. haematobium infections were found. Anemia, stunting, and wasting had prevalences of 23%, 28%, and 14%, respectively. No statistically significant associations were found between latrine absence or evidence of open defecation at home, and hookworm infection (adjusted odds ratio, OR = 1.28, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.476-3.44; and adjusted OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 0.468-3.12; respectively); or between hookworm infection and anemia, stunting, or wasting (adjusted OR = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.988-1.57; adjusted OR = 0.992, 95% CI: 0.789-1.25; and adjusted OR = 0.969, 95% CI: 0.722-1.30; respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this setting, no statistically significant associations were found between sanitation and hookworm; or between hookworm and anemia, stunting, or wasting.

            "abstract": "This cross-sectional study set out to determine the prevalence, pattern and risk factors for undernutrition during early infancy in a setting with substantial non-hospital births against the backdrop of limited evidence on nutritional status in the first three months of life based on an exclusively breast-fed reference population. Undernutrition based on z-scores below -2 for weight-for-age, height/length-for-age and body-mass-index-for-age among infants (0-3 months) attending clinics for routine Bacille de Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunisation in Lagos, Nigeria from July 2005 to March 2008 was determined using current World Health Organisation's Multicentre Growth Reference (WHO-MGR). Maternal and infant factors associated with undernutrition were explored with multivariable logistic regression analyses. Of the 5888 full-term infants enrolled 51% were born outside hospital and 99.4% were exclusively breast-fed. 811 (13.8%) were underweight (weight-for-age), 1802 (30.8%) were stunted (height/length-for-age) and 579 (10.0%) were wasted (body-mass-index-for-age). Altogether, 3635 (61.6%) infants were not undernourished while 192 (3.3%) were undernourished by all three nutritional measures. Intrauterine growth restriction was a significant contributor to undernutrition. Maternal age, multiple pregnancies and gender were associated with all nutritional indices. Additionally, maternal education, ownership/type of residence, parity, antenatal care, place of delivery and hyperbilirubinaemia were predictive of underweight, stunting and wasting. We conclude that undernutrition is prevalent in the first three months of life in this population and can be detected early at routine immunisation clinics shortly after birth. Maternal/perinatal history offers valuable predictors in resource-poor communities where the majority of births occur outside hospital."

            "abstract": "Between March and July, 1987, faecal specimens from 371 diarrhoeal children reporting to four hospitals in the district of Kurunegala, Sri Lanka and from 121 controls with other diseases were investigated for enteric pathogens. All specimens were tested for Shigella spp, Salmonella spp and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). In addition, parasitic pathogens, heat labile enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC LT), Campylobacter and rotavirus were sought among subsamples of the cases and controls. One or more pathogens were detected in the faecal specimens of 53.7% of the diarrhoeal children and 19.6% of the controls (P less than 0.001). Rotavirus was the most frequently identified pathogen. Cases (21.9%) were more likely to be positive for rotavirus than controls (6.5%) (p less than 0.05). Among children with diarrhoea the peak prevalence of rotavirus occurred in the 6-11 months age group. Shigella spp were the second most frequently isolated pathogens and the single most common cause of diarrhoea in children over two years of age. Again, cases (16.4%) were more likely to be infected than controls (1.7%) (p less than 0.001). Salmonella spp were isolated from 7.5% of diarrhoeal children and 3.3% of the controls (p greater than 0.10). Other pathogens had prevalence rates of less than 5%. Vomiting was associated with rotavirus diarrhoea (p less than 0.001), and fever with shigellosis (p = 0.02). In view of the different transmission routes and characteristics of the most important pathogens detected in this study it appears unlikely that a single environmental intervention can solve the public health problem posed by diarrhoeal diseases in Sri Lanka."

Relatively little is known on how weather shocks predict increases in wasting in a population. This study explores whether deviation in rainfall in Ethiopia, a drought prone country, is a sensitive indicator of future increases in wasting. Around 12% of children 0-23 months were wasted, but we found no consistent association between the rainfall shock variables and child weight-for-height Z-scores. The results indicate that monitoring rainfall does not provide a practical early warning to use for scaling up financing and management of preventative measures without additional information to increase precision."

However, no published experimental evidence currently exists that tests the interaction effects between sanitation and handwashing. We present the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania, with the objective of tracing the causal chain from hygiene and sanitation promotion to changes in child health outcomes and specifically testing for potential interaction effects of combining handwashing and sanitation interventions.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study is a factorial cluster-randomized control trial where 181 rural wards from 10 districts in Tanzania were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together or neither (control). Interventions were rolled out from February 2009 to June 2011 and the endline survey was conducted from May to November 2012, approximately one year after program completion. The sample was composed of households with children under 5 years old in the two largest villages in each ward. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but enumerators played no part in the intervention and were blinded to treatment status. The primary outcome of interest was 7-day diarrhea prevalence for children under five. Intermediate outcomes of behavior change including improved latrine construction, levels of open defecation and handwashing with soap were also analyzed. Secondary health outcomes included anemia, height-for-age and weight-for-age of children under 5. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to assess the relationship between the interventions and outcomes of interest.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      One year after the end of the program, ownership of improved latrines increased from 49.7% to 64.8% (95% CI 57.9%-71.7%) and regular open defecation decreased from 23.1% to 11.1% (95% CI 3.5%-18.7%) in sanitation promotion-only wards. Households in handwashing promotion-only wards showed marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation but not at other critical junctures. There were no detectable interaction effects for the combined intervention. The associated cost-per-household gaining access to improved sanitation is estimated to be USD $194.

We investigated the relationship between water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) parameters, microbial and antibiotic resistance (AR) contamination levels in drinking water, and health outcomes using health survey and molecular analysis during June and July of 2014 in two settlement types (agro-pastoralist villages and transhumant pastoralist camps). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine fecal contamination sources, enteric pathogens, and antibiotic resistance genes. Ruminant-associated fecal contamination was widespread in both settlement types (81.2%), with human-associated contamination detected in 21.7% of the samples. Salmonella spp. (59.4%) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (stx1 44.9% and stx2 31.9%) were detected across all samples. Tetracycline resistance was found only in village samples. A significant difference in diarrheal incidence within the past 28 days among young children was found between camps (31.3%) and villages (0.0%). Our findings suggest that water contamination may play an important role in contributing to gastrointestinal illness, supporting the need for future research and public health intervention to reduce gastrointestinal illness in the area."

We evaluated the impact of the Laos Basic Education, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Programme - a comprehensive WinS project implemented by UNICEF Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) in 492 primary schools nationwide between 2013 and 2017 - on pupil education and health.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From 2014-2017, we conducted a cluster-randomized trial among 100 randomly selected primary schools lacking functional WASH facilities in Saravane Province, Lao PDR.

Intervention schools received a school water supply, sanitation facilities, handwashing facilities, drinking water filters, and behavior change education and promotion. Comparison schools received the intervention after research activities ended. At unannounced visits every six to eight weeks, enumerators recorded pupils' roll-call absence, enrollment, attrition, progression to the next grade, and reported illness (diarrhea, respiratory infection, conjunctivitis), and conducted structured observations to measure intervention fidelity and adherence. Stool samples were collected annually prior to de-worming and analyzed for soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infection.

The 24-wk intervention included a lipid-based nutrient supplement, education, promotion of existing clinical services, and social support. We compared growth outcomes among intervention participants (n = 73) at start (wk 0) and end (wk 24) of intervention to a historical control group of HIV-exposed infants seen at the GHESKIO in the year prior to the intervention who would have met the intervention entrance criteria (n = 294). The intervention and historical control groups did not differ significantly at age 6 mo (wk 0). At age 12 mo (wk 24), the intervention group had a lower prevalence of underweight and stunting than the historical control group (weight-for-age Z-score < -2 SD: 6.8 vs. 20.8%, P = 0.007; length-for-age Z-score < -2 SD: 9.6 vs. 21.2%, P = 0.029). Wasting tended to be lower in the intervention group than the historical control (weight-for-length Z-score < -2 SD: 2.9 vs. 8.9%, P = 0.11). Implementation of the intervention was associated with reduced risk of growth faltering in HIV-exposed uninfected children from 6 to 12 mo of age.

We test this hypothesis by re-reviewing a Cochrane-standard systematic review (SR) of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions' impact on child diarrhoea morbidity: can greater understanding of impacts and how they are achieved be gained when the same papers are reviewed jointly from health and development perspectives? Using realist review methods, researchers examined the 27 papers for evidence of other impact pathways operating than assumed in the papers and SR. Evidence relating to four questions was judged on a scale of likelihood. At the 'more than possible' or 'likely' level, 22% of interventions were judged to involve substantially more actions than the SR's label indicated; 37% resulted in substantial additional impacts, beyond reduced diarrhoea morbidity; and unforeseen actions by individuals, households or communities substantially contributed to the impacts in 48% of studies. In 44%, it was judged that these additional impacts and actions would have substantially affected the intervention's effect on diarrhoea morbidity. The prevalence of these impacts and actions might well be found greater in studies not so narrowly selected. We identify six impact pathways suggested by these studies that were not considered by the SR: these are tentative, given the limitations of the literature we reviewed, but may help stimulate wider review and primary evaluation efforts. This re-review offers a fuller understanding of the impacts of these interventions and how they are produced, pointing to several ways in which investments might enhance health and wellbeing. It suggests that some conclusions of the SR and earlier reviews should be reconsidered. Moreover, it contributes important experience to the continuing debate on appropriate methods to evaluate and synthesize evidence on complex interventions."

We also conducted an observational survey to make an assessment of water handling and hygiene. Ninety-two percent (47/51) of samples tested at supply points were adequately chlorinated and bacterial contamination was found in two samples with no residual chlorine. Samples collected from household storage containers showed an increase in contamination in 18/50 houses (36%). Households with contaminated stored samples did not show significant differences in demographics, water handling, hygiene practices, or sanitation.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Between 2006 and 2008, there have been various reports of diarrhea with blood in Ethiopia and also reports of Shigelloses outbreaks in some parts of the country. In March 2010, Addis Ababa University (AAU) Technology Campus reported occurrence of an outbreak of diarrheal illness among students.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The study was conducted to identify the causative agent and the possible source of the diarrhea outbreak that occurred at Technology Campus.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Active case finding and review of medical records were undertaken to characterize the outbreak. The investigation consisted of a case-control study with laboratory testing and environmental assessment. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using Epi-info (v3.3.2).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 104 suspected cases were identified, based on the case definition, with an attack rate of 6.8%. Stool culture confirmed Shigella flexneri species in 5/11 (45%) of specimens tested. Risk factors associated with illness included eating specific foods at specific meal times. Food items served on Friday March 26, at lunch time (OR: 3.59, CI: 1.0- 12.7, p = 0.04) and on Saturday March 27, during dinner (OR: 2.89 CI: 1.0- 8.2, p = 0.04) were significantly associated with increased odds of illness. Water stored in a tank in the cafeteria had evidence of fecal contamination (fecal coliform count > 161 Mpn /100ml) and the hygiene and sanitary conditions in the cafeteria, kitchen, living area were unsatisfactory.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Food-borne transmission and water contamination were suspected as the sources of infection. Regular supervision and inspection of the campus' food handling facilities and practices were recommended to improve food hygiene and sanitation. Improved water storage, correcting periodic water shortages in the latrine facility and promotion of hand washing could reduce potential future outbreaks."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      Undernutrition is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among under-five children, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries. Since women, including mothers, are the primary caregivers of their children, their empowerment status can inherently influence children's nutritional status. Empowerment is, mainly, an intrinsic agency developed as an affective domain trajectory or attitude that guides the skill or behavior. This study aimed to assess the association between women's empowerment and nutritional status of their children.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A cross-sectional study was carried out among 300 mothers having children aged 6-59 month in rural municipalities of Kaski district in Nepal. Face to face interview and various anthropometric measurements were used to collect data. Chi-square test was performed to assess the association between women's empowerment and children's nutritional status, and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the strength of association.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 300 mothers having 6-59 months' children, nearly half (49%) were highly empowered while around 38% children were in poor nutritional status. More than one-fourth (26.7%) children were stunted, 7% were wasted, 17.7% were underweight, and in overall, nearly 38% were in poor nutrition. There was a five-fold increase in odds of wasting, thirty-fold increase in odds of stunting, and twenty-nine-fold increase in odds of underweight among children whose mothers had low empowerment status compared to their counterparts.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Overall, this study exhibited that maternal empowerment strongly affected children's nutritional status, especially stunting and underweight. Thus, intrinsic factor, mainly education and community membership are suggested to empower them for making their own decisions. Interventions aiming to improve nutritional status of children should include women empowerment incorporating dimensions of material resources. Further empirical evidence is required from trials and cohort studies."

This paper explores the scope of implications for future anthropometric research, highlighting foreseeable effects on the choice of research questions, choice of nutritional indices, training of measurers, and issues of internal and external validity of research results. The conclusion drawn is that the introduction of the WHO child growth standards is expected to have wide implications for growth and nutrition research. The full scope of this effect will gradually become clear while researchers, similar to health care workers, make the transition to using the new standards, re-evaluate results of past approaches, and explore the uses and functional validity of the standards, including those for indices that were not previously available."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Shigellosis is the major cause of bloody diarrhoea worldwide and is endemic in most developing countries. In Kenya, bloody diarrhoea is reported weekly as part of priority diseases under Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System (IDSR) in the Ministry of Health.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a case control study with 805 participants (284 cases and 521 controls) between January and December 2012 in Kilifi and Nairobi Counties. Kilifi County is largely a rural population whereas Nairobi County is largely urban. A case was defined as a person of any age who presented to outpatient clinic with acute diarrhoea with visible blood in the stool in six selected health facilities in the two counties within the study period. A control was defined as a healthy person of similar age group and sex with the case and lived in the neighbourhood of the case.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The main presenting clinical features for bloody diarrhoea cases were; abdominal pain (69 %), mucous in stool (61 %), abdominal discomfort (54 %) and anorexia (50 %). Pathogen isolation rate was 40.5 % with bacterial and protozoal pathogens accounting for 28.2 % and 12.3 % respectively. Shigella was the most prevalent bacterial pathogen isolated in 23.6 % of the cases while Entamoeba histolytica was the most prevalent protozoal pathogen isolated in 10.2 % of the cases. On binary logistic regression, three variables were found to be independently and significantly associated with acute bloody diarrhoea at 5 % significance level; storage of drinking water separate from water for other use (OR = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.20-0.87, p = 0.021), washing hands after last defecation (OR = 0.24, 95 % CI 0.08-.076, p = 0.015) and presence of coliforms in main source water (OR = 2.56, CI 1.21-5.4, p = 0.014). Rainfall and temperature had strong positive correlation with bloody diarrhoea.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The main etiologic agents for bloody diarrhoea were Shigella and E. histolytica. Good personal hygiene practices such as washing hands after defecation and storing drinking water separate from water for other use were found to be the key protective factors for the disease while presence of coliform in main water source was found to be a risk factor. Implementation of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions is therefore key in prevention and control of bloody diarrhoea."

            "abstract": "The microbiological contamination of waterways by pathogenic microbes has been, and is still, a persistent public safety concern in the United States and in most countries of the world. As most enteric pathogens are transmitted through the fecal-oral route, fecal pollution is generally regarded as the major contributor of pathogens to waterways. Fecal pollution of waterways can originate from wastewater treatment facilities, septic tanks, domestic- and wild-animal feces, and pets. Because enteric pathogens are derived from human or animal sources, techniques capable of identifying and apportioning fecal sources have been intensively investigated for use in remediation efforts and to satisfy regulatory concerns. Pollution of human origin is of the most concern, since human feces is more likely to contain human-specific enteric pathogens. Fecal indicator bacteria have been used successfully as the primary tool for microbiologically based risk assessment. However measurement of fecal indicator bacteria does not define what pathogens are present, or define the sources of these bacteria. Microbial source tracking (MST) methods that have the ability to differentiate among sources of fecal pollution are currently under development. These methods will ultimately be useful for risk assessment purposes and to aid regulatory agencies in developing strategies to remediate microbiologically impaired waterways."

            "abstract": "After age 6 mo, the combination of breast-feeding and unfortified plant-based complementary feeding provides inadequate zinc (Zn). Additionally, high phytate intakes compromise the bioavailability of zinc. Our principal objective in this randomized controlled, doubly masked trial was to determine the effect of substituting low-phytate maize, a daily 5-mg zinc supplement, or both, in infants between ages 6-12 mo on impaired linear growth velocity, a common feature of zinc deficiency. In the Western Highlands of Guatemala, 412 infants were randomized to receive low-phytate or control maize. Within each maize group, infants were further randomized to receive a zinc supplement or placebo. Length, weight, and head circumference were measured at 6, 9, and 12 mo of age. There were no significant differences between the 2 maize groups or between the Zn supplement and placebo groups and no treatment interaction was observed for length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ) or head circumference Z-scores. Overall mean (+/- SD) Z-scores at 6 mo for combined treatment groups were: LAZ, -2.1 +/- 1.1; WLZ, 0.7 +/- 1.0; and head circumference Z-score, -0.7.0 +/- 1.0. At 12 mo, these had declined further to: LAZ, -2.5 +/- 1.1; WLZ, -0.0 +/- 0.9; and head circumference Z-score, -0.9 +/- 1.1; 83.3% were stunted and 2% were wasted. Low linear growth in older Guatemalan infants was not improved with either low-phytate maize or a daily 5-mg zinc supplement. Low contribution of maize to the complementary food of the infants negated any potential advantage of feeding low-phytate maize."

Between 2000 and 2015, nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight, the core components of child growth failure. Here we show that striking subnational heterogeneity in levels and trends of child growth remains. If current rates of progress are sustained, many areas of Africa will meet the World Health Organization Global Targets 2025 to improve maternal, infant and young child nutrition, but high levels of growth failure will persist across the Sahel. At these rates, much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target-to end malnutrition by 2030. Geospatial estimates of child growth failure provide a baseline for measuring progress as well as a precision public health platform to target interventions to those populations with the greatest need, in order to reduce health disparities and accelerate progress."

HIV-induced immune impairment heightened risk of opportunistic infection and can worsen nutritional status of children. HIV infection often leads to nutritional deficiencies through decreased food intake, mal-absorption and increased utilization and excretion of nutrients, which in turn can hasten death.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the magnitude of underweight, wasting and stunting among HIV positive children in East Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The authors systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed studies that assessed the prevalence of underweight, wasting and stunting among HIV positive children in East Africa from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Gray Literatures using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guideline. The last search date was December 30/2019. The data was extracted in excel sheet considering country, study design, year of publication, prevalence reported. Then the authors transformed the data to STATA 14 for analysis. Heterogeneity across the studies was assessed by the Q and the I2 test. A weighted inverse variance random-effects model was used to estimate the magnitude of underweight, wasting and stunting. The subgroup analysis was done by country, year of publication, and study design. To examine publication bias, a funnel plot and Egger's regression test were used.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For the analysis a total of 22 studies with 22074 patients were used.

The prevalence of under-weight among HIV positive children was found to be 49.67% in Ethiopia followed by 42.00 in Rwanda. It was high among cohort studies (44.87%). Based on the year of publication, the prevalence of under-weight among HIV positive children was found to be 40.88% from studies conducted from January 2008-December 2014, while it was 43.68% from studies conducted from 2015-2019. The prevalence of wasting among HIV positive children was found to be 29.7% in Tanzania followed by 24.94% in Ethiopia. Based on the study design, the prevalence of wasting among HIV positive children was found to be high in cohort studies (31.15%).

STHs interfere with the human host's health status, and their burden of disease is highest among children of school age. Based on the results of a nationwide survey conducted in 2003, which showed an STH prevalence of 47.2%, and with the aim of reducing morbidity among school children, Afghanistan has been conducting nationwide deworming for preschool-age and school-age children since 2004. In 2017, 14 years after the first baseline assessment, a follow-up survey was carried out among schoolchildren aged 8-10 years to provide an update on STH epidemiology and facilitate evidence-informed planning of future deworming campaigns. Stool samples were collected from 2263 pupils aged 8-10 years in five provinces representing the different ecological zones of the country - Kabul, Balkh, Herat, Nangarhar and Kandahar. Microscopic examination was carried out by the Kato-Katz thick smear technique, to assess the presence and the number of parasites and/or their eggs. The survey revealed that 26.6% of the sample was infected with at least one of the STH, a marked decrease from the level registered in 2003. The most prevalent infection was the one with A. lumbricoides (25.7%), followed by T. trichiura (1.0%) and hookworms (0.1%). All positive children were noted to have light-intensity infections, compared to the previous survey where 9.7% of the sample had moderate-to-heavy intensity infections. Only 0.2% of the children had co-infection with two or more parasites. Meanwhile, 6.8% of the students were found infected with the dwarf tapeworm, Hymenolepis nana. The absence of infections of moderate-to-heavy intensity after several yearly rounds of deworming and overall improvements in provision of safe water and sanitation, indicates successful control of morbidity due to STH and, overall, their elimination as a public-health problem from Afghanistan. Nevertheless, current levels of prevalence of infection still show persistence of active transmission of STHs, thus justifying the continued implementation of mass deworming interventions among children. The permanent elimination of STH transmission, however, will be possible only when the country reaches a sanitation level sufficient to impede fecal contamination of the environment with human excreta."

Each day, worldwide, approximately 440 children became newly infected with HIV, and 270 children died from AIDS-related causes in 2018. Poor nutrition has been associated with accelerated disease progression, and sufficient dietary diversity is considered a key to improve children's nutritional status. Therefore, this study aims to 1) examine nutritional status of school-age children living with HIV in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and 2) identify factors associated with their nutritional status, especially taking their dietary diversity into consideration.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2018 within the catchment area of the National Pediatric Hospital, Cambodia. Data from 298 children and their caregivers were included in the analyses. Using semi-structured questionnaires, face-to-face interviews were conducted to collect data regarding sociodemographic characteristics, quality of life, and dietary diversity. To assess children's nutritional status, body weight and height were measured. Viral load and duration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were collected from clinical records.

            "abstract": "We conducted a study in a low-ranking socioeconomic community in Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) to determine the source of household faecal contamination (HFC), devise an index, and associate this index with diarrhoeal incidence in children. Observation was used to collect information on the sources of household faecal contamination (HFC) and a twice-weekly monitoring scheme was employed for determining diarrhoea incidence. A valid household faecal contamination index (HFCI) was developed using three sources of HFC: going about without footwear, indiscriminate defaecation near or under the house, and absence of latrine. The risk of diarrhoea significantly increased from 4.21 to 8.66 per 1000 child-days (P less than 0.001) when HFCI increased from 0 to 3. Although the adjusted rate ratios for the three levels of HFCI were approximately equal to 2.00 (2.16, 1.77, 2.14), they were not statistically significant. Further studies are needed to corroborate the results of what seems to be the first study attempting to associate HFC with diarrhoea incidence."

            "abstract": "Subsistence hunting is the main source of protein for forest reserve dwellers, contributing to the development of spurious infections by Calodium hepaticum, frequently associated with the consumption of the liver from wild mammals. The prevalence of infections by soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) and intestinal protozoa is considered an indicator of the social vulnerability of a country, besides providing information on habits, customs and quality of life of a given population. Intestinal parasites mostly affect poor rural communities with limited access to clean water and adequate sanitation. This study reports the results of a parasitological survey carried out in 2017 and 2019, in two municipalities (Xapuri and Sena Madureira) in Acre State. Stool samples were collected from 276 inhabitants. Upon receipt, each sample was divided into two aliquots. Fresh samples without preservative were processed and examined by the Kato-Katz technique. Samples fixed in 10% formalin were processed by the spontaneous sedimentation and the centrifugal sedimentation techniques. Calodium hepaticum eggs were found in three stool samples. The overall STH prevalence was 44.9%. The hookworm prevalence (19.2%) was higher than that of Ascaris lumbricoides (2.5%) and Trichuris trichiura (0.7%), an unexpected finding for municipalities belonging to the Western Brazilian Amazon. When considering parasites transmitted via the fecal-oral route, Endolimax nana and Entamoeba coli showed the highest positivity rates, of 13% and 10.9%, respectively. This study is the first report of spurious infection by C. hepaticum among forest reserve dwellers that consume undercooked liver of lowland pacas. Additionally, this is the first report of Blastocystis sp. in Acre State."

To address this problem, in 2005 a programme was initiated to install water stations for hand washing and drinking water in 109 health facilities, train health workers on water treatment and hygiene, and motivate clients to adopt these practices. In 2008, we evaluated this intervention's impact by conducting observations at facilities, and interviewing staff and clients about water treatment and hygiene. Of 30 randomly selected facilities, 97% had water stations in use. Chlorine residuals were detectable in at least one container at 59% of facilities.

We illustrated these common pitfalls by building association, prediction, and classification models using birthweight as an exposure and child mortality and child anthropometric failure as outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Nationally representative samples of 188,819 and 164,113 children aged less than 5 years across India were used for our analysis of mortality and anthropometric failure, respectively.

We used adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models to evaluate association strength, univariable and multivariable logistic regression models trained on 80% of the data using 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate predictive power, and classification models across a series of possible misclassification cost scenarios to evaluate classification accuracy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Birthweight was strongly associated with five of six outcomes (P < .001), and associations were robust to covariate adjustment.

Prediction models for anthropometric failure showed substantially better calibration than prediction models for mortality. Depending on the ratio of false positive (FP) cost to false negative (FN) cost, the probability cutoff that minimized total misclassification cost ranged from 0.116 (cost ratio = 7:93) to 0.706 (cost ratio = 4:1), TPR ranged from 0.999 to 0.004, and PPV ranged from 0.355 to 0.867..\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although birthweight is strongly associated with mortality and anthropometric failure, it is a poor predictor of child health outcomes, highlighting that strong associations do not imply predictive power.

Therefore, a critical look at the distribution of malnutrition within its sub-regions is required to identify the worst affected areas. This study provides a meta-analysis of the prevalence of malnutrition indicators (stunting, wasting and underweight) within four sub-regions of sub-Saharan Africa.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Cross-sectional data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (2006-2016) of 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa were used. The countries were grouped into four sub-regions (East Africa, West Africa, Southern Africa and Central Africa), and a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the prevalence of each malnutrition indicator within each of the sub-regions. Significant heterogeneity was detected among the various surveys (I2 >50%), hence a random effect model was used, and sensitivity analysis was performed, to examine the effects of outliers.

Baseline coverage estimates for HCFs have yet to be formed for the SDGs; and there is little evidence describing inequalities in coverage. To address this, we produced the first coverage estimates of environmental conditions and standard precaution items in HCFs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and explored factors associated with low coverage. Data from monitoring reports and peer-reviewed literature were systematically compiled; and information on conditions, service levels, and inequalities tabulated. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with low coverage. Data for 21 indicators of environmental conditions and standard precaution items were compiled from 78 LMICs which were representative of 129,557 HCFs. 50% of HCFs lack piped water, 33% lack improved sanitation, 39% lack handwashing soap, 39% lack adequate infectious waste disposal, 73% lack sterilization equipment, and 59% lack reliable energy services. Using nationally representative data from six countries, 2% of HCFs provide all four of water, sanitation, hygiene, and waste management services. Statistically significant inequalities in coverage exist between HCFs by: urban-rural setting, managing authority, facility type, and sub-national administrative unit. We identified important, previously undocumented inequalities and environmental health challenges faced by HCFs in LMICs.

However, a single slide prepared from a single stool specimen has low sensitivity, particularly in light infections. Therefore, there is a great need for concentration techniques. This study detected an accurate and affordable method for diagnosis of fecal-orally transmitted helminthes and other geohelminthes. The study was carried out on 217 stool samples of different sex and age groups. Stool samples were collected from different urban and rural areas in Sharkia Governorate. Stool samples were examined macroscopically and analyzed by different parasitological techniques: direct wet mount (DWM), Kato-Katz thick smear, spontaneous sedimentation in tube technique (SSTT) and formol ether sedimentation technique (FEC). The results showed that formol ether sedimentation method detected 59 positive samples followed by spontaneous sedimentation in tube technique (48/59 positive samples). FEC showed significant difference when compared to direct wet mount and Kato-Katz thick smear. SSTT also showed significant difference when compared to DWM (P <0.05).The overall prevalence of intestinal helminthes was (29.6%) among studied samples in Sharkia Governorate.

Despite the strong influence of agroecology on agriculture in those countries, limited information exists on whether undernutrition in children under five varies with agro-ecological location.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using Karamoja sub-region of Uganda, one of the most food insecure parts of Eastern Africa as a case area, and applying a multi-stage sampling procedure, and a structured questionnaire, this study examined in a comparative manner, the prevalence and predictors of undernutrition in children under five among the agricultural, pastoral, and agro-pastoral ecological zones. Chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to establish the disparity in prevalence of undernutrition and household contextual characteristics, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of undernutrition in children under five among the three agro-ecological zones. The level of statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of underweight, stunting, and wasting ranged from 36 to 58% but varied with agroecology in terms of the peak age ranging from 6 to 37 months. Child characteristics, feeding practices, household economic factors, sanitation factors, and caregiver characteristics that predict undernutrition among children under five were identified (p ≤ 0.05). Caregiver handwashing after using latrine (p = 0.005) and diarrhoea in a fortnight (p < 0.001) increased the likelihood of stunting in pastoral agroecology only whereas cereal storage in both sacks and granary in agro-pastoral zone was associated with reduced likelihood of both underweight (p < 0.001 and p = 0.014) and stunting (p = 0.011 and p = 0.018), respectively. A male child was more likely to be underweight and stunted in pastoral (p = 0.002 and p = 0.011) and agro-pastoral (p = 0.017 and p = 0.002) agroecology, respectively. Household expenses reduced the likelihood of both underweight and wasting in pastoral (p = 0.013 and p = 0.005) and agricultural (p = 0.011 and p = 0.021) agroecology, respectively. Flour storage duration increased the stunting likelihood in pastoral (p = 0.032) and agro-pastoral (p = 0.006) agroecologies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study has revealed that, in a food insecure developing country setting such as Karamoja sub-region of Uganda, undernutrition among children under five varies with agroecology.

            "abstract": "In South Asia, childhood undernutrition persists while overweight is increasing. Internationally recommended infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices promote healthy nutritional status; however, little is known about IYCF in Bhutan, investigated here using 2015 National Nutrition Survey data. WHO/UNICEF IYCF indicators, anthropometry and household socio-economic status were available for 441 children <24 months. Stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence (<-2Z length-for-age [LAZ], weight-for-age, [WAZ] and weight-for-length [WLZ], respectively) were 15%, 9%, and 5%, respectively, whereas overweight (WLZ >2) prevalence was 6%. In survey-design-adjusted analyses, 52% of mothers of 0- to 5-month olds reported exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), with EBF less common for girls than boys (OR: 0.2 [95% CI: 0.1-0.9]). Although 61% of children were breastfed at 2 years and 75% of children >6 months met a minimum daily meal frequency, only 18% of children 6-23 months met minimum dietary diversity. IYCF was unassociated with risk of stunting, wasting, or underweight, possibly due to relatively low prevalence of anthropometric failure and small sample size. However, currently-breastfed children were less often overweight [OR: ~0.1 (95% upper limit ≤1.0)]. Neither breastfeeding nor most complementary feeding practices differed by socio-economic status, but children in the highest two fifth of a wealth index had 7.8 (1.3-46.9) and 5.3 (1.1-25.2) times greater odds than children in the lowest fifth of meeting minimum dietary diversity criteria. Low rates of EBF, given possible protection of breastfeeding against overweight, and inadequate dietary diversity offer evidence to guide future program interventions to improve nutritional status of young children."

            "abstract": "Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections cause significant morbidity in children and women of reproductive age. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive chemotherapy (PC) of at-risk populations with anthelminthics to control these infections. Historically, STH are very intensively transmitted in Pemba Island (Zanzibar). A survey conducted in 1994 in 12 schools estimated a STH prevalence near to 100%. This extremely high prevalence induced the introduction of PC in the island; initially, however, PC was not regularly administered because of difficulties linked to drug procurement. A second STH survey, conducted in 2011, in 24 schools estimated a prevalence of STH of 89%; after this survey, PC was regularly administered until 2018. We conducted a survey in 2021 using the same method as that used in 2011. The prevalence of STH was evaluated at 80% (95% CI 78.1-81.5) and most of the STH cases were due to Trichuris trichiura. More than 32% (95% CI 30.3-34.0) of the children investigated had infections of moderate or heavy intensity. PC has been conducted for over 25 years in Pemba Island. However, despite its beneficial impact, both the prevalence and the intensity of STH infections remain high, and the intervention has been insufficient in controlling STH morbidity. This is probably due to a combination of irregular PC, climatic conditions favourable to STH transmission, the low sensitivity of T. trichiura to benzimidazoles, high population density and poor sanitation. Improvement of sanitation coverage remains a key measure to permanently reduce the prevalence and intensity of STH. Possible changes to the present PC approaches to better control STH in Pemba would be (i) to assure high coverage in all schools, (ii) to use mebendazole instead of albendazole given its better activity on T. trichiura and (iii) to use a combination of ivermectin and mebendazole to further increase anthelminthic efficacy on T. trichiura."

For causal estimation, we use household- and mother-fixed effects, which allows us to compare outcomes across siblings while controlling for all observed and unobserved confounders that are shared by the siblings, such as household social characteristics and home location. In addition, we control for a wide range of sibling-varying confounders, including sex, age, birth order and mother's age at birth, as well as vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-polio (DPT), as a broad indicator of general likelihood to receive vaccinations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our samples include 347,808 individuals in 132 surveys from 59 countries (for stunting), 430,963 individuals in 190 surveys from 65 countries (for wasting), and 353,520 individuals in 130 surveys from 59 countries (for underweight).

We quantified the fecal indicator Escherichia coli and the enteric pathogens of adenovirus, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella spp./enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), and Vibrio cholerae. At least one enteric pathogens was detected in 13% of household stored water, 47% of hand, 46% of table surface, 26% of plate surface, 75% of floor surface, 96% of soil, 56% of standing water, 77% of drainage ditch, and 100% of stream samples despite all households having access to a toilet or latrine. Our results provide evidence that children may be exposed to enteric pathogens from several exposure points, that domestic hygiene practices related to water treatment and child handwashing were associated with reduced pathogen detection in this setting, but household table and floor cleaning practices were not, that ownership or presence of chickens in the compound was associated with increased detection of C. jejuni inside households and on soil, that there were interactions among different transmission pathways for enteric pathogens, and that there were differential correlations between E. coli and enteric pathogens for different pathogens and environmental sample types. Additionally, V. cholerae was detected at several exposure points during a cholera outbreak. Overall, these results suggest that interventions that can disrupt many transmission pathways may be needed to reduce enteric pathogen exposure in this urban slum setting."

Clusters were randomly allocated to standard of care, IYCF (20 g of small-quantity lipid-based nutrient supplement per day from age 6 to 18 months plus complementary feeding counseling), WASH (ventilated improved pit latrine, handwashing stations, chlorine, liquid soap, and play yard), and WASH + IYCF. Primary outcomes were child length-for-age Z-score and hemoglobin concentration at 18 months of age. Children who completed the 18-month visit and turned 2 years (102-112 weeks) between March 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017, were eligible for the ECD substudy. We prespecified that primary inferences would be drawn from findings of children born to HIV-negative mothers; these results are presented in this paper. A total of 1,655 HIV-unexposed children (64% of those eligible) were recruited into the ECD substudy from 206 clusters and evaluated for ECD at 2 years of age using the Malawi Developmental Assessment Tool (MDAT) to assess gross motor, fine motor, language, and social skills; the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI) to assess vocabulary and grammar; the A-not-B test to assess object permanence; and a self-control task. Outcomes were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population. For all ECD outcomes, there was not a statistical interaction between the IYCF and WASH interventions, so we estimated the effects of the interventions by comparing the 2 IYCF groups with the 2 non-IYCF groups and the 2 WASH groups with the 2 non-WASH groups. The mean (95% CI) total MDAT score was modestly higher in the IYCF groups compared to the non-IYCF groups in unadjusted analysis: 1.35 (0.24, 2.46; p = 0.017); this difference did not persist in adjusted analysis: 0.79 (-0.22, 1.68; p = 0.057). There was no evidence of impact of the IYCF intervention on the CDI, A-not-B, or self-control tests. Among children in the WASH groups compared to those in the non-WASH groups, mean scores were not different for the MDAT, A-not-B, or self-control tests; mean CDI score was not different in unadjusted analysis (0.99 [95% CI -1.18, 3.17]) but was higher in children in the WASH groups in adjusted analysis (1.81 [0.01, 3.61]). The main limitation of the study was the specific time window for substudy recruitment, meaning not all children from the main trial were enrolled.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found little evidence that the IYCF and WASH interventions implemented in SHINE caused clinically important improvements in child development at 2 years of age. Interventions that directly target neurodevelopment (e.g., early stimulation) or that more comprehensively address the multifactorial nature of neurodevelopment may be required to support healthy development of vulnerable children.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01824940."

This study addressed this gap.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A community-based comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among 224 children under five in three randomly selected rural kebeles (the smallest administrative units in Ethiopia) where CLTSH had been implemented and 448 similar children in three other randomly selected rural kebeles where CLTSH had not been implemented during February and March, 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and an on-the-spot observational checklist. Data were analyzed using three different binary logistic regression models with 95% confidence interval (CI): the first model (Model I) was used for CLTSH-implementing kebeles, the second model (Model II) for non-CLTSH-implementing kebeles, and the third model (Model III) for pooled analysis of CLTSH-implementing and non-implementing kebeles. To control confounders, each multivariable logistic regression model was built by retained variables with p < 0.25 from the bi-variable logistic regression analysis. From the adjusted multivariable analysis of each model, variables with p-values < 0.05 were declared factors significantly associated with acute diarrhea.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of acute diarrhea among children under five from households in kebeles that had implemented CLTSH was 10.6% (95% CI:6.6-14.7%) and among those that had not implemented CLTSH 18.3% (95%CI:14.8-22.2%).

The objective of the present study is to assess the current nutritional status of pre-school children and to correlate the prevalence of malnutrition with Household Deprivation Status (HDS) in one of the deprived districts of the Punjab province in Pakistan. Using primary data collected from 384 households through a proportional purposive random sampling technique, this study calculates the z-scores of weight-for-age (WAZ), weight-for-height (WHZ), and height-for-age (HAZ). The study has used a cut-off point which is -2 standard deviations below the median of the WHO/NCHS reference population for each anthropometric indicator. The results indicate that the underweight, stunting, and wasting prevalence rates are 46.1%, 34.83%, and 15.49% respectively in district Rahimyar Khan. Also, the expected tendency of malnutrition is worst for HDS-1 and HDS-2 which are the most deprived segments of the population. As the household shifts from HDS-1 to HDS-2 and further to HDS-3, the rates of stunting (HAZ) and underweight (WAZ) decreases but wasting (WHZ) does not. The study concludes that the high prevalence of malnutrition in the district is correlated with overall socio-economic deprivation."

The relationship between anthropometric status and a range of water, sanitation and hygiene-related exposures was examined. After taking account of socioeconomic and other potential confounding factors, some evidence was found that boiling of water was associated with improved height-for-age. It seems unlikely that boiling of water alone could be responsible for the observed increase in height-for-age. Boiling of water may be acting as a \"marker\" for a range of hygiene and child-care behaviours. No convincing evidence of any other association was found. In particular, water source was not associated with anthropometric status. A concurrent study conducted in the same population found evidence of a substantial reduction in diarrhoea morbidity associated with the use of improved sources. These findings, taken together, lend support to the hypothesis that interventions for the control of diarrhoea may have no detectable impact on anthropometric status."

We hypothesized that low-grade systemic inflammation (defined as elevations in serum C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein) in infancy suppresses the growth hormone⁻insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis and is associated with subsequent stunting. Blood samples of 590 children from periurban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were obtained at 6 weeks and 6 months of age as part of a randomized controlled trial. Primary outcomes were stunting, underweight, and wasting (defined as length-for-age, weight-for-age and weight-for-length z-scores < -2) between randomization and endline (18 months after randomization). Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of time to first stunting, underweight, and wasting as outcomes, with measures of systemic inflammation, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) as exposures, adjusting for numerous demographic and clinical variables.

Synthetic faeces and faecal sludge can provide consistently reproducible substrate and alleviate these challenges. A critical literature review of simulants developed for various wastewater and faecal sludge related research is provided. Most individual studies sought to develop a simulant representative of specific physical, chemical, or thermal properties depending on their research objectives. Based on the review, a suitable simulant can be chosen and used or further developed according to the research needs. As an example, the authors present such a modification for the development of a simulant that can be used for investigating the motion (movement, settling and sedimentation) of faeces and their physical and biological disintegration in sewers and in on-site sanitation systems."

Group A had higher weight gain per day versus group B. Height growth velocity was significantly higher in Group B (7.4±3.6 cm/yr) versus group A (5.7±2.8 cm/yr). Ht-SDS increased significantly in the group of patients who had lower Ht-SDS before NR.

This study explored factors contributing to child stunting and wasting and their regional inequalities among 1,938 Cambodian children aged 6-23.9 months. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study (year 2017) conducted in six districts of two north-eastern provinces and the capital and used as cross-sectional. Socio-demographic and household characteristics, children's feeding practices during the previous 24 hr, and children's length and weight measurements were collected. Gradient boosting models were used to calculate the contribution of determinants to child undernutrition whereas concentration index was used to assess the impact of those determinants on stunting and wasting inequalities among socioeconomic groups. It was found that low-household wealth could predict 21% to 45% of child stunting and 23% to 36% of wasting across regions. After wealth, source and treatment of drinking water were found the second major predictor for stunting (15%) and wasting (21%). Combining child nutrition and household water, sanitation and hygiene indicators predicted around 30% of child undernutrition, either in the form of stunting or wasting. Mothers' education predicted >30% of stunting in the north-eastern region. Results highlight that a complex interplay of factors contributes to child stunting and wasting. An integrated, intersectoral, equity-focused approach that addresses children's dietary quality, household's water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, mother's education, and poverty is likely to yield the highest impact in achieving further gains in nutritional status among Cambodian children."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Safe disposal of children's faeces has always been one of the main challenges to good hygiene in Ghana. Although it has been proven that children's faeces are more likely to spread diseases than adults' faeces, people usually mistake them for harmlessness. This study, therefore, sought to determine the prevalence and factors associated with safe disposal of children's faeces in Ghana.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey was used for the analysis. A sample size of 2228 mother-child pairs were used for the study. The outcome variable was disposal of children stools. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the factors with safe child stool disposal.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of safe child stool disposal in Ghana was 24.5%. Women in the middle [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 4.62; Confidence Interval (CI) = 3.00-7.10], Coastal Zone [AOR = 4.52; CI = 2.82-7.22], mothers whose children were aged 12-17 [AOR = 1.56; CI = 1.15-2.13] and 18-23 months [AOR = 1.75; CI = 1.29-2.39], and mothers whose household had improved type of toilet facility [AOR = 2.04; CI = 1.53-2.73] had higher odds of practicing safe children's faeces disposal. However, women from households with access to improved source of drinking water [AOR = 0.62; CI = 0.45-2.7] had lower odds of practicing safe children's faeces disposal.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Approximately only about 25 out of 100 women practice safe disposal of their children's faeces in Ghana. The age of the child, ecological zone, the type of toilet facilities, and the type of drinking water source are associated with the disposal of child faeces. These findings have proven that only improved sanitation (i.e. drinking water and toilet facilities) are not enough for women to safely dispose of their children's faeces. Therefore, in addition to provision of toilet facilities especially in the northern zone of Ghana, there is also the need to motivate and educate mothers on safe disposal of children's stools especially those with children below 12 months. More so, mothers without access to improved toilet facility should also be educated on the appropriate ways to bury their children's stools safely."

            "abstract": "Reduction in prevalence of underweight children (under five years of age) has been included as an indicator for one of the targets to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (Goal 1) of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The most recent MDG report of 2012 indicates that the target of reducing extreme poverty by half has been reached five years ahead of the 2015 deadline but close to one third of children in Southern Asia were underweight. In India, at the historical rate of decline the proportion of underweight children below 3 years, required to be reduced to 26% by 2015, is expected to come down only to about 33%. With barely 3 years left for achieving MDGs, the level of commitment to reduce child undernutrition needs to be gauged and effectiveness of current strategies and programmes ought to be reviewed. Undernutrition in children is not affected by food intake alone; it is also influenced by access to health services, quality of care for the child and pregnant mother as well as good hygiene practices. Would the scenario be different if child undernutrition was a part of Goal 4 of MDGs? What difference it would have made in terms of strategies and programmes if reduction in undernutrition in children underfive was a target instead of an indicator? It is time for nutrition to be placed higher on the development agenda. A number of simple, cost-effective measures to reduce undernutrition in the critical period from conception to two years after birth are available. There is a need for choosing nutrition strategies relevant in Indian context. Experiences from other countries should lead India toward innovative nutritional strategies to reduce underfive undernutrition in the country- that too on a fast track."

To understand the socio-cultural factors impacting on water safety, we documented knowledge, attitudes and practices of water handling and usage, sanitation and defecation in rural Tamilnadu, India, using questionnaires and focus group discussions, in a village divided into an upper caste Main village and a lower caste Harijan colony. Our survey showed that all households stored drinking water in wide-mouthed containers. The quantity of water supplied was less in the Harijan colony, than in the Main village (P<0.001). Residents did not associate unsafe water with diarrhoea, attributing it to 'heat', spicy food, ingesting hair, mud or mosquitoes. Among 97 households interviewed, 30 (30.9%) had toilets but only 25 (83.3%) used them. Seventy-two (74.2%) of respondents defecated in fields, and there was no stigma associated with this traditional practice. Hand washing with soap after defecation and before meals was common only in children under 15 years (86.4%). After adjusting for other factors, perception of quantity of water received (P<0.001), stated causation of diarrhoea (P=0.02) and low socio-economic status (P<0.001) were significantly different between the Main village and the Harijan colony. Traditional practices may pose a significant challenge to programmes aimed at toilet usage and better sanitation."

            "abstract": "Solar disinfection (SODIS) effectively improves the microbial quality of drinking water for preventing diarrhea; however, the effect of participant motivation has not been studied. This 1-year randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of SODIS of drinking water and motivation on the incidence of dysentery and nondysentery diarrhea among children of age 6 months to 5 years living in periurban communities in South Africa.We compared 383 children in 297 households using SODIS with 335 children in 267 households with no intervention. At baseline 62.4% of the study households had stored water which met World Health Organization guidelines for zero thermotolerant coliforms per 100 mL. Dysentery was recorded using a pictorial diary. Incidence of dysentery was significantly associated with higher motivation, defined as 75% or better completion of diarrhea data. Incidence rates were lower in those drinking solar disinfected water (incidence rate ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 - 1.0, P = 0.071) but not statistically significant. Compared with the control, participants with higher motivation achieved a significant reduction in dysentery (incidence rate ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.16 - 0.81, P = 0.014). However, there was no significant reduction in risk at lower levels of motivation. Solar disinfection was not significantly associated with nondysentery diarrhea risk overall (P = 0.419). A statistically significant reduction in dysentery was achieved only in households with higher motivation, showing that motivation is a significant determinant for measurable health gains. Failure of three-quarters of participants to achieve a significant reduction in dysentery suggests that research into effective implementation is required."

This study analyzed individual and household-level risk factors for the presence of IgG antibodies to Toxocara spp. in urban Amazonian children over a period of 7 years and evaluated the seroconversion rates over a 1-year follow-up. In children < 59 months of age, the overall prevalence rate was 28.08% in 2003 and 23.35% in 2010. The 2010-2011 seroconversion rates were 13.90% for children 6-59 months of age and 12.30% for children 84-143 months of age. Multilevel logistic regression analysis identified child age, previous wheezing, and current infection with hookworm as significant associated factors for Toxocara spp. seropositivity in 2003. In 2010, age, previous helminthiasis, and having a dog were associated with seropositivity, whereas having piped water inside the household was a protective factor.

The ICN2 was a high-level intergovernmental meeting that focused global attention on addressing malnutrition in all its forms: undernutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies, overweight, and obesity. The ICN2 was held to specifically address the persistent and unacceptably high levels of malnutrition. Despite much progress in reducing hunger globally, 795 million people remain undernourished, over 2 billion people suffer from various micronutrient deficiencies, and an estimated 161 million children under 5 years of age are stunted, 99 million underweight, and 51 million wasted. Meanwhile, more than 600 million adults are obese. Global problems require global solutions. The ICN2 brought together national policy-makers from food, agriculture, health, education, social protection and other relevant sectors to address the complex problem of malnutrition through a multi-sectoral approach. Two outcome documents - the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action - were endorsed by participating governments at the Conference, committing world leaders to establishing national policies aimed at eradicating malnutrition in all its forms and transforming food systems to make nutritious diets available to all. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition is a political statement of 10 commitments for more effective and coordinated action to improve nutrition, while the Framework for Action is a voluntary technical guide of 60 recommendations for the implementation of the political commitments. This chapter provides information on the ICN2 and its outcomes as well as follow-up activities. Emphasis is placed on the Rome Declaration on Nutrition and the Framework for Action, with special focus on hidden hunger problems that have to be addressed through different interventions and a multi-sectoral approach."

This research helps policy makers look between urban and rural communities and states to take a population-level approach to addressing the root causes of child malnutrition.

We examined the anthropometric status and risk factors for malnutrition among children aged 0-59 months through the 2015 National Nutrition Survey in Bhutan. We assessed in 1,506 children nutritional status (by z-scores of height-for-age [HAZ], weight-for-height [WHZ], and weight-for-age [WAZ]), estimating prevalence, adjusted for survey design, of stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight (<-2 for HAZ, WHZ, and WAZ and >2 for WHZ). Children were also assessed for pedal oedema. We conducted multivariable linear/logistic regression analysis to identify child, maternal, and household risk factors for childhood undernutrition and overweight, excluding children with oedema (1.7%). Mean (SE) HAZ, WHZ, and WAZ were -0.82 (0.13), 0.10 (0.04), and -0.42 (0.05), respectively. Prevalence of stunting, wasting, underweight, and overweight were 21.2%, 2.6%, 7.4%, and 2.6%, respectively. In multivariable regressions, risk of stunting significantly increased by age: 5.3% at <6 months (reference), 16.8% at 6-23 months (OR = 3.06, 95% CI [0.63, 14.8]), and 25.0% at 24-59 months (OR = 5.07, [1.16, 22.2]). Risk of stunting also decreased in a dose-response manner with improved maternal education. None of the examined variables were significantly associated with wasting or overweight. Despite a WHZ distribution comparable with the World Health Organization reference (with ~2.6% vs. an expected 2.5% of children beyond 2 z in each tail), stunting persists in one fifth of preschool Bhutanese children, suggesting that other nutrient deficits or nonnutritional factors may be constraining linear growth for a substantial proportion of children."

Understanding pathways of child fecal exposure and nutritional deficiencies is critical to informing interventions to reduce stunting. Our aim was to explore determinants of latrine use, disposal of child feces, and perceptions and provisions of a safe and clean child play environment among families with children under two (CU2) years to inform the design of a behavior change intervention to address water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH), and nutrition behaviors. In 2016, we conducted a mixed-methods formative research in western Kenya. We conducted 29 key informant interviews with community leaders, health workers, and project staff; 18 focus group discussions with caregivers of CU2 years; and 24 semi-structured household observations of feeding, hygiene, and sanitation behaviors. We used the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior model as our theoretical framework to map caregiver behavioral determinants. Latrine use barriers were lack of latrines, affordability of lasting materials, and social acceptability of unobserved open defecation. Barriers to safe disposal of child feces were lack of latrines, time associated with safe disposal practices, beliefs that infant feces were not harmful, and not knowing where children had defecated. Primary barriers of clean play environments were associated with creating and maintaining play spaces, and shared human and animal compounds. The immediate cost to practicing behaviors was perceived as greater than the long-term potential benefits. Intervention design must address these barriers and emphasize facilitators to enable optimal WASH behaviors in this context."

Children in low caste (Dalits) had higher prevalence of stunting (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21; 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.01, 1.44), underweight (OR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.24, 1.75), and wasting (OR = 1.53; 95% CI = 1.21, 1.92) than those children in upper caste group. This association was modestly attenuated with adjustment for HAP. Exposure to HAP partly explained the caste-ethnic difference in undernutrition among children in Nepal."

            "abstract": "This study aimed to assess whether weight, length, and conditional growth during the first year are associated with glycemia and insulin resistance among young adults. A non-concurrent longitudinal design was used in the study. This is a population-based cohort study, composed of people aged from 22 to 28 years. We estimated z-scores from birth to the first year and the infants were classified as stunted, underweight, overweight, obese, wasted, and at risk of wasting, using cut-offs proposed by the World Health Organization (Child Growth Standards, 2006). Conditional weight and length gain variables were estimated. Glycemia, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and single point insulin sensitivity estimator (SPISE) were evaluated in adulthood. Multiple linear regressions that includes the variables associated with glycemia and insulin resistance were used. In total, 1,070 subjects were evaluated and glycemia in adulthood was higher among subjects who were wasted or at risk of wasting at 12 months (β coefficient = 2.77; 95%CI: 0.37; 5.21). In relation to normal weight, those subjects who were overweight at 12 months showed the lowest glycemia (β coefficient = -2.39; 95%CI: -4.32; -0.36). Conditional weight gain in the first year was negatively associated with glycemia in adulthood (β coefficient = -0.65; 95%CI: -1.23; -0.08). SPISE was higher among underweight subjects, and negatively associated with conditional relative weight gain and conditional linear growth in the first year. In conclusion, we found that undernutrition and suboptimal growth were associated with higher glycemia."

There was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the prevalence of underweight and stunting over two time periods (1999 and 2008). Logistic regression showed that the risk of underweight was 1.7 times higher among children of illiterate mothers and those suffering from morbidities, while stunting was 1.4 times higher among children belonging to lowest and middle household's wealth indexes. Undernutrition is a public health problem and is associated with literacy of mother, household wealth index and morbidities.

By conducting questionnaires and focus group discussions in two BRAC WASH villages and one control village, this investigation sought to assess the impact of BRAC's programme on knowledge, practices and diarrhoeal burden, to explore the extent to which knowledge determines practices, and to evaluate which factors were most predictive of diarrhoeal incidence. It was found that the programme had a beneficial effect on the subjects' knowledge and practices, and on the diarrhoeal incidence among their children. Furthermore, except for where personal financial expenditure was required, practices tended to follow on from knowledge. However, BRAC's intervention affected neither the frequency of soap use in handwashing by the mother, nor the child's consumption of unclean water outside of the home. These factors, along with the child's consumption of unclean water inside the home, were shown to be those most predictive of diarrhoeal incidence among the under-fives. It is recommended that BRAC continues to emphasize the importance of these points, while also potentially promoting the use of less costly alternatives to soap and cheaper point-of-use treatment materials, to induce positive behaviour change."

One of the key aspects in this regard in the developing world is achieving improved nutrition through economic development. Nonetheless, there is a dearth of literature that empirically verifies the association between economic growth and reduction of childhood undernutrition in low- and middle-income countries. Thus, the aim of the study is to assess the interplay between economic growth and reduction of childhood undernutrition in Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study used pooled data of three rounds (2000, 2005 and 2010) from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) of Ethiopia. A multilevel mixed logistic regression model with robust standard errors was utilized in order to account for the hierarchical nature of the data. The dependent variables were stunting, underweight, and wasting in children in the household. The main independent variable was real per capita income (PCI) that was adjusted for purchasing power parity. This information was obtained from World Bank.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 32,610 children were included in the pooled analysis. Overall, 11,296 (46.7%) [46.0%-47.3%], 8,197(33.8%) [33.2%-34.4%] and 3,175(13.1%) [12.7%-13.5%] were stunted, underweight, and wasted, respectively. We found a strong correlation between prevalence of early childhood undernutrition outcomes and real per capita income (PCI). The proportions of stunting (r = -0.1207, p<0.0001), wasting (r = -0.0338, p<0.0001) and underweight (r = -0.1035, p<0.0001) from the total children in the household were negatively correlated with the PCI. In the final model adjustment with all the covariates, economic growth substantially reduced stunting [β = -0.0016, SE = 0.00013, p<0.0001], underweight [β = -0.0014, SE = 0.0002, p<0.0001] and wasting [β = -0.0008, SE = 0.0002, p<0.0001] in Ethiopia over a decade.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Economic growth reduces child undernutrition in Ethiopia. This verifies the fact that the economic growth of the country accompanied with socio-economic development and improvement of the livelihood of the poor.

Handwashing interventions have proven efficacy for reducing the rate of transmission of common infectious diseases. Few studies have analyzed the delivery of health interventions for children in orphanages in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this gap, we conducted an ecological assessment and piloted a handwashing intervention in an orphanage in rural Malawi, focusing on caregiver knowledge and behaviors, child handwashing behaviors, and disease incidence. A secondary study aim was to demonstrate program feasibility for a future randomized controlled trial. Orphanage caregivers participated in a three-module educational intervention on handwashing based on WHO recommendations and workshops on how to teach the curriculum to children. Seventeen orphanage caregivers and 65 children were monitored for handwashing behavior and child disease incidence. Friedman's tests were conducted to compare changes in caregiver knowledge and behaviors. Child handwashing behaviors and surveillance of child disease incidence were measured pre- and post-intervention. There were significant increases in caregiver hand hygiene knowledge. At six months post-intervention, handwashing with soap increased significantly among caregivers (p < 0.001) and was observed in children. The incidence of acute respiratory infections decreased from 30% to 6% post-intervention, resulting in an 80% decrease. The incidence of diarrhea decreased from 9.2% to 6.2% post-intervention, resulting in a 33% decrease. A brief educational intervention may improve handwashing knowledge and behaviors and help to decrease the incidence of common infectious diseases in an orphanage in rural Malawi. In addition, the caregiver uptake of the intervention demonstrated feasibility for future studies."

            "abstract": "Water, sanitation and hygiene interventions have been the subject of cluster trials of unprecedented size, scale and cost in recent years. However, the question 'what works in water, sanitation, hygiene (WASH)?' remains poorly understood. Evaluations of community interventions to prevent infectious disease typically use lab-confirmed infection as a primary outcome; however, WASH trials mostly use reported diarrhoea. While diarrhoea is a significant source of morbidity, it is subjected to significant misclassification error with respect to enteric infection due to the existence of non-infectious diarrhoea and asymptomatic infection. We show how this may lead to bias of estimated effects of interventions from WASH trials towards no effect. The problem is further compounded by other biases in the measurement process. Alongside testing for infection of the gut, an examination of the causal assumptions underlying WASH interventions present several other reliable alternative and complementary measurements and outcomes. Contemporary guidance on the evaluation of complex interventions requires researchers to take a broad view of the causal effects of an intervention across a system. Reported diarrhoea can fail to even be a reliable measure of changes to gastrointestinal health and so should not be used as a primary outcome if we are to progress our knowledge of what works in WASH."

            "abstract": "Poor nutrition and hand hygiene are risk factors for acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Safe drinking water and sanitation can reduce exposure to pathogens and encourage healthy immune responses, reducing the risk of ARIs. Within a trial assessing impacts of water, sanitation, and handwashing (WASH), and nutritional interventions, we evaluated effects on ARIs. The WASH Benefits cluster-randomized trial enrolled pregnant women from Kenyan villages and evaluated health outcomes in children born to enrolled mothers 1 and 2 years after intervention delivery. Geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomized into a passive control (no promotional visits), a double-sized active control (monthly visits to measure mid-upper arm circumference), and six intervention groups: chlorinated drinking water (W), improved sanitation (S), handwashing with soap (H), combined WSH, improved nutrition (N) through counseling and lipid-based nutrient supplementation (LNS), and combined WSHN. The main outcome was the prevalence of ARI symptoms (cough, panting, wheezing, or difficulty breathing) in children younger than 3 years. Masking participants was not possible. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Between November 2012 and May 2014, 702 clusters were enrolled, including 6,960 (year 1) and 7,088 (year 2) children with ARI data. The cluster-level intra-cluster correlation coefficient for ARIs was 0.026 across both years. Water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions with behavior change messaging did not reduce ARIs. Nutrition counseling and LNS modestly reduced ARI symptoms compared with controls in year 1 [prevalence ratio (PR): 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.99], but no effect in the combined WSHN group weakens this finding."

This study describes two drinking water outbreaks in Finland in 2016 (outbreak I) and 2018 (outbreak II). Both outbreaks caused approximately 450 illness cases and were due to drinking water pipe breakage and subsequent wastewater intrusion into the distribution system. In both outbreaks, the sapovirus was found in patient samples as the main causative agent. In addition, adenoviruses and Dientamoeba fragilis (outbreak I), and noroviruses, astroviruses, enterotoxigenic and enterohemorragic Escherichia coli (ETEC and EHEC, respectively) and Plesiomonas shigelloides (outbreak II) were detected in patient samples. Water samples were analyzed for the selected pathogens largely based on the results of patient samples. In addition, traditional fecal indicator bacteria and host-specific microbial source tracking (MST) markers (GenBac3 and HF183) were analyzed from water. In drinking water, sapovirus and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were found in outbreak II. The MST markers proved useful in the detection of contamination and to ensure the success of contaminant removal from the water distribution system. As mitigation actions, boil water advisory, alternative drinking water sources and chlorination were organized to restrict the outbreaks and to clean the contaminated distribution network. This study highlights the emerging role of sapoviruses as a waterborne pathogen and warrants the need for testing of multiple viruses during outbreak investigation."

A total of 422 fecal samples were examined by using Kato-Katz thick smear, modified Harada-Mori culture and formalin ether concentration techniques. Seven nematode species, ie Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, Strongyloides stercoralis, Enterobius vermicularis and unidentified rhabditoids of free-living nature, were detected. Trematode and cestode infection was not proven. Necator americanus was the predominant species of hookworm. Soil-transmitted nematode infections were highly prevalent. Among the young inhabitants aged less than 15, positive rates of Ascaris, Trichuris and hookworm infections were 32.7, 52.7 and 68.6%, respectively. Among the people aged 15 or more, the positive rate for hookworm (85.9%) was much higher than that for Ascaris and Trichuris (13.5 and 40.5%, respectively). Egg count revealed that more than 90% of inhabitants with Trichuris or hookworm had light infections. The latrines in the surveyed area seemed to have only limited effects on the improvement of the parasitological status because the prevalence of Trichuris infections was much higher in a village where most houses were provided with latrines. These conflicting conditions were considered to have been caused by many factors including the inadequate structure of the latrines."

The evaluation involved two cross-sectional surveys in a representative sample of students, with the end-line survey conducted 12 months after the baseline survey. The primary outcome was the combined prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura infections at the end-line survey.

Behaviour change interventions have been effective at improving practice, but few studies have investigated the effects of multicomponent integrated interventions. We conducted a cluster-randomized controlled trial in rural Bangladesh in which geographic clusters were randomized into seven arms: water treatment (W), sanitation (S), handwashing (H), water, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH), improved nutrition with infant and young child feeding messages and lipid-based nutrient supplementation for 6- to 24-month olds (N), N+WSH, and control. The objective of this paper was to examine the independent and combined effects of interventions on indicators of complementary feeding. Approximately 1 and 2 years after initiation of the intervention, research assistants surveyed mothers about infant feeding practices. Complementary feeding was examined using the World Health Organization indicators of infant and young child feeding practices. We used Poisson regression models to estimate prevalence ratios and linear regression models for prevalence differences with clustered sandwich estimators to adjust for clustering. A total of 4,718 households from 720 clusters were surveyed at year 1 and 4,667 at year 2. The children in the nutrition arms had a higher prevalence of meeting the minimum dietary diversity score compared with controls (year 1: N: 66.4%; N+WSH: 65.0% vs. C:32.4%; year 2: N: 91.5%; N+WSH: 91.6% vs. C:77.7%).

Recent studies have identified the most important etiologies of diarrheal disease are enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic E. coli, Shigella spp., rotavirus, norovirus and Cryptosporidium spp. These etiologies are unsurprisingly characterized by a combination of high shedding, high infectivity, and transmissibility through multiple environmental reservoirs. The relative importance of the transmission routes is likely site-specific. So the impact of interventions, which typically target only one or two environmental reservoirs, is likely also site-specific. The factors influencing the transmission routes most important for diarrheal disease are complex, including - at a minimum - etiology of endemic disease; and water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure and practices. The site-specific nature - and complexity of transmission - helps explain the observed variation in impacts of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions. It may also render efforts to estimate or quantify global means for interventions' impacts irrelevant. The theme of this Perspective is that greater reductions in diarrheal disease transmission in LMICs can be achieved by designing interventions to interrupt the most important environmental transmission pathways. Intervention choice should be informed by site-specific conditions, most notably: diarrheal etiology and existing water, sanitation, and hygiene infrastructure and practices. The theme is discussed through the lens of the characteristics of the most important diarrheal diseases (shedding, infectivity, growth, and persistence) and the general characteristics of environmental reservoirs (exposure pathways and fecal contamination). The discussion highlights when interventions - and combinations of interventions - will be most effective at reducing diarrheal disease burden."

We identified key indicators for poultry feces management and investigated their social determinants using data from a baseline survey of a randomized-controlled trial of a poultry management training program in rural Western Uganda. The baseline survey was conducted in the Masindi and Kiryandongo districts of Uganda in September 2019, and data collected from 609 households were used. We evaluated indicators for poultry feces management behaviors using scale development methods, including descriptive statistics, bivariate correlation analyses, and Factor Analysis of Mixed Data. We also investigated social determinants of key poultry feces management behaviors using logistic and multinomial logistic regression models. A significant increase in odds of having free-roaming poultry was found for each additional poultry owned (OR = 1.18, P < 0.001). The odds of a household having an observed enclosure for poultry increased by 5% with each incremental poultry owned (OR = 1.05, P < 0.001), and by 4% with increasing wealth with each additional point on the poverty probability index score (OR = 1.04, P < 0.001). Our results also suggest enclosures are intermittently used and constructing them without further intervention likely will not be sufficient for effectively managing animal fecal contamination. We recommend that future studies on animal feces management measure indicators for corralling and feces disposal practices and evaluate their relationship to enteric pathogen exposure and health outcomes. Insights from this work can inform the development of robust indicators of poultry feces management behaviors that can be used for monitoring and evaluation purposes."

            "abstract": "Objectives:\n        \n      \n      Little research exists documenting levels of intestinal inflammation among indigenous populations where exposure to macroparasites, like soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), is common. Reduced STH exposure is hypothesized to contribute to increased prevalence of elevated intestinal inflammation in wealthy nations, likely due to coevolutionary histories between STHs and human immune systems that favored anti-inflammatory pathways. Here, we document levels of intestinal inflammation and test associations with STH infection among the Shuar of Ecuador, an indigenous population undergoing socioeconomic/lifestyle changes that influence their hygienic environment. We predict that fecal calprotectin (FC; a measure of intestinal inflammation) will be lower in STH infected individuals and that FC will be negatively associated with infection intensity.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Stool samples to analyze FC levels and STH infection were collected from 69 Shuar participants (ages 5-75 years). Children (<15 years) and adults (15+ years) were analyzed separately to understand the role of exposure in immune system development and the intestinal inflammatory response.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Two species of STH were present: Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura. The relationships between infection and intestinal inflammation were age- and species-specific. While no significant relationships were found among adults, children who were singly infected with T. trichiura had lower FC levels than uninfected children. Infection intensity was not significantly associated with FC in children or adults.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These preliminary results provide limited support for our hypotheses, documenting tentative age- and species-specific associations between FC and infection status.

Population sample is representative of the whole of the island's population excepting the 0-4 years old group whose faeces are difficult to obtain. Faeces are examined through the Kato method, a very simple, quick and remarkably accurate procedure. Trichuriasis and ascariasis, which are transmitted in the area around the house, affect mainly children, but also adults. Women seem to be more often infested than men by Ascaris lumbricoides. Necatoriasis, the farmer's disease, hits primarily young men and elderly women who spend most time in the fields.

            "abstract": "Childhood diarrhea is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children under five in low and middle-income countries, second only to respiratory illness. The mouthing behavior that is common in children exposes them to fecal-orally transmitted pathogens that can result in diarrhea; however, there is a need for further evidence on specific exposure routes. This study describes the frequency and diversity of two important routes of enteric pathogen exposure among infants 3-9 months of age: infant oral contact behavior and caregiver handwashing behavior. Data were collected through structured observations of 25 index infants for the oral contact data and 25 households for the caregiver handwashing data in a peri-urban setting in Kisumu (Obunga), Kenya. Breast was the most common type of oral contact event with an average of 3.00 per observation period and 0.5 events per hour. This was followed by a range of physical objects with an average of 2.49 per observation and 0.4 events per hour. The \"infant's own hands\" was the third most common oral contact, with an average of 2.16 events per hour, and 0.4 oral contact events per hour. Food and liquids were the 4th and 5th most common oral contact events with an average of 1.64 food contacts and 0.52 liquid oral contact events per observation period. Feeding events, including breastfeeding, were the most commonly observed key juncture-71% of total junctures observed were caregivers feeding children. This was followed by child cleaning (23%), caregiver toilet uses at (4%), and lastly food preparation at 2%. HWWS was observed only once before a feeding event (1%), twice after cleaning a child (9%), and twice after caregiver toilet use (40%). The combined implication of data from observing oral contact behavior in children and hand hygiene of caregivers suggests that caregiver hand hygiene prior to feeding events and after cleaning a child are priority interventions."

The majority of the respondents, between 50-99%, could not identify the main causes of the WASH-related diseases. This paper also showed that students lack health knowledge in regard to WASH-related diseases' causes and prevention. Therefore, the provision of water and sanitation infrastructures should go with the provision of health education on how to avoid these diseases and possible ways to improve the well-being of the students both at home and in their various schools."

            "abstract": "Stool disposal practices have been shown to be associated with childhood diarrhoea. However, efforts to promote improved hygiene behaviour are hampered by a lack of understanding of what determines those behaviours. Data from 2793 household interviews with mothers of children from the town of Bobo-Dioulasso in Burkina Faso were analyzed to examine what differentiated mothers who reported using safer stool disposal practices from those who did not. Three 'outcomes' were considered: where the child was reported to defaecate; where the mother reported disposing of the child stools; and whether excreta were observed in the compound. Regression models were developed to identify those factors with the strongest independent associations with the outcomes. There was a consistent association between the source of water and the outcomes. Mothers with access to a tap in the yard reported using safe hygiene practices three times more often than mothers using wells outside the compound and twice as often as mothers who used public standpipes or wells within the yard. The source of water showed a similar pattern of association with observations of faecal matter in the environment. Improved sources of water may contribute to safer stool hygiene by reducing the time spent on water collection or by encouraging mothers to conform to higher standards of hygiene. Other factors which played a role in predicting the hygiene behaviour of mothers were the husbands' occupation, the number of health education sessions that she had attended, her zone of residence and family ownership of certain valuable objects. These factors are likely to be related and to be, to some extent, proxies for the real determinants of her behaviour. A model of the cultural, psycho-social and infrastructural proximate determinants of hygiene behaviour is proposed. Data from focus group discussions suggested that the main purpose of hygienic behaviour is to conform to existing norms of social etiquette. Trials of interventions based on changing such norms are needed to test whether this is an effective means of promoting of safer hygiene practices."

Even if children are exempted from fasting, some mothers do not prepare their food from animal sources as it could contaminate utensils for cooking family foods. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess feeding practices and undernutrition in 6⁻23-months old children whose mothers are Ethiopian Orthodox religion followers during lent fasting and non-fasting periods in rural Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, and to identify associated factors. A community-based longitudinal study was carried out in Ethiopian Orthodox lent fasting and non-fasting periods. Using a multi-stage systematic random sampling technique, 567 and 522 children aged 6⁻23 months old participated in the fasting and non-fasting assessments, respectively. Statistical analyses were done using logistic regression, an independent sample t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank (WSRT) and McNemar's tests. The prevalences of stunting, underweight and wasting were 31.6⁻33.7%, 11.7⁻15.7% and 4.4⁻4.8%, respectively. The weight-for-height (WHZ) and height-for-age (HAZ) values for children of fasting mothers were significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared to those of non-fasting mothers. Likewise, the median weight-for-age (WAZ) and diet diversity score (DDS) of children of fasting mothers were also significantly higher in non-fasting than in fasting periods. A small proportion of children (2.3⁻6.7%) met the minimum acceptable diet (MAD) in the study population, but these measures were significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the children of non-fasting mothers. Mother's fasting during lactation period of the indexed child was amongst the independent factors common in child stunting, underweight and wasting. Nutritional status and feeding practices of 6⁻23-month-old children are affected by maternal fasting during the fasting period. Therefore, without involvement of religious institutions in the existing nutritional activities, reduction of undernutrition would not be successful and sustainable."

H. nana infection was associated with a 2.85g/L decrease in haemoglobin levels (P<0.001) despite already low average haemoglobin levels. The proportions of children with knowledge about intestinal helminths and protective hygiene practices varied significantly between regions (both P<0.001). Mass albendazole administration to school-aged children and women of child-bearing age against intestinal helminths has been conducted in Tajikistan in spring 2012, followed by mass albendazole and praziquantel distribution to school-aged children in autumn 2012. In the longer term, an integrated approach including chemotherapy, provision of safe water and proper sanitation as well as targeted health education will be necessary to achieve sustainable control."

            "abstract": "The main proportion of the plant nutrients in waste from society can be recycled in two unpolluted fractions if the urine and the faeces are collected separately. By using urine-diverting toilets combined with a whirlpool surface tension faecal separator, it is possible to achieve this. If the separator is installed correctly, with a gradual bend to minimise disintegration of the particles, it is possible to collect approximately 92% nitrogen, 86% phosphorus and 76% potassium of the content excreted in the faeces in a small separated fraction that only contains 10% of the flushwater used. The faecal separation is a robust system with no moving parts, which is not significantly affected by the flushwater volume, and almost no water is separated to the separated solids if neither toilet paper nor faeces are flushed."

Most of the subjects had acyanotic heart disease accounting for 87.7%. The overall prevalence of wasting, underweight and stunting were 41.3%, 49.1% and 43% respectively. Children with congenital heart disease and having pulmonary hypertension, were found more likely to develop wasting compared to those without pulmonary hypertension with an odds of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4) and also have greater chance of stunting with an odds of 1.9 (95% CI: 1.0-3.4).

We aimed to assess the effectiveness of a rural sanitation intervention, within the context of the Government of India's Total Sanitation Campaign, to prevent diarrhoea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, and child malnutrition.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial between May 20, 2010, and Dec 22, 2013, in 100 rural villages in Odisha, India. Households within villages were eligible if they had a child younger than 4 years or a pregnant woman. Villages were randomly assigned (1:1), with a computer-generated sequence, to undergo latrine promotion and construction or to receive no intervention (control). Randomisation was stratified by administrative block to ensure an equal number of intervention and control villages in each block. Masking of participants was not possible because of the nature of the intervention. However, households were not told explicitly that the purpose of enrolment was to study the effect of a trial intervention, and the surveillance team was different from the intervention team. The primary endpoint was 7-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years. We did intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01214785.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We randomly assigned 50 villages to the intervention group and 50 villages to the control group. There were 4586 households (24,969 individuals) in intervention villages and 4894 households (25,982 individuals) in control villages. The intervention increased mean village-level latrine coverage from 9% of households to 63%, compared with an increase from 8% to 12% in control villages. Health surveillance data were obtained from 1437 households with children younger than 5 years in the intervention group (1919 children younger than 5 years), and from 1465 households (1916 children younger than 5 years) in the control group. 7-day prevalence of reported diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years was 8·8% in the intervention group and 9·1% in the control group (period prevalence ratio 0·97, 95% CI 0·83-1·12). 162 participants died in the intervention group (11 children younger than 5 years) and 151 died in the control group (13 children younger than 5 years).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Increased latrine coverage is generally believed to be effective for reducing exposure to faecal pathogens and preventing disease; however, our results show that this outcome cannot be assumed.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and associated factors among 404 children under age five attending childcare services with their mothers in selected healthcare facilities of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Anthropometry, socio-demographics and obstetric history were collected. Height-for-age, weight-for-age and body mass index-for-age Z-scores were used to determine stunting, underweight and thinness among children, respectively. Logistic regression analyses were performed to generate the factors associated with malnutrition. Stunting (45.3%) was the prevalent form of malnutrition among children under age five, affecting boys (51.7%) more than girls (38.8%) and children aged 12-23 months (62.4%) more than those <11 months old (40.1%), in addition to the overall prevalence of underweight (29.0%) and thinness (12.6%). Boys had increased odds of stunting (adjusted odds ratio, AOR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.26-3.41, p = 0.004) and underweight (AOR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.32-3.57, p = 0.002) than girls. Children aged 12-23 months were more likely to be stunted (AOR = 4.79, 95% CI: 2.36-9.75, p ≤ 0.0001) than children aged ≤11 months. Delayed introduction of solid foods increased the odds of stunting (AOR = 5.77, 95% CI: 2.63-12.64, p ≤ 0.0001) and underweight (AOR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.08-3.89, p = 0.028). Children with normal birth weight were less likely to be thin (AOR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.19-0.92, p = 0.029) and underweight (AOR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.17-0.68, p = 0.003) than children who had low birth weight. Children whose mothers had obtained secondary school education (AOR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16-0.97, p = 0.044), and Grade 12 or post-Grade 12 education (AOR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.12-0.83, p = 0.020) were less likely to be stunted than were children of mothers who had only primary school education. Suboptimal complementary feeding predisposed children to stunting and underweight.

This study examined the nutritional status of children under 3 years of age using data from the fourth round of Indian National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-2016. Child undernutrition was assessed in a sample of 126,431 under-3 children using the anthropometric indices of stunting, underweight and wasting ('anthropometric failure') across 640 districts, 5489 primary sampling units and 35 states/UTs of India. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the regional pattern of childhood undernutrition. Multilevel logistic regression models were fitted to examine the adjusted effect of social group (tribal vs non-tribal) and economic, demographic and contextual factors on the risks of stunting, underweight and wasting accounting for the hierarchical nature of the data. Interaction effects were estimated to model the joint effects of socioeconomic position (household wealth, maternal education, urban/rural residence and geographical region) and social group (tribal vs non-tribal) with the likelihood of anthropometric failure among children. The burden of childhood undernutrition was found to vary starkly across social, economic, demographic and contextual factors. Interaction effects demonstrated that tribal children from economically poorer households, with less-educated mothers, residing in rural areas and living in the Central region of India had elevated odds of anthropometric deprivation than other tribal children. The one-size-fits-all approach to tackling undernutrition in tribal children may not be efficient and could be counterproductive."

We found poor sanitary conditions, such as presence of feces or soiled diapers around the compound, to be associated with higher risk of protozoan infections. Certain latrine features, including drop-hole covers and latrine walls, and presence of a water tap on the compound grounds were associated with a lower risk of bacterial and protozoan infections. Any breastfeeding was also associated with reduced risk of infection.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found a high prevalence of enteric infections, primarily among children without diarrhea, and weak associations between bacterial and protozoan infections and environmental risk factors including WASH.

Children aged 12-23 mo received 155 kcal/d and thereafter until 35 mo received 200 kcal/d. The primary outcomes were change in length-for-age z score (LAZ) and improvements in a biomarker of EED, the percentage of lactulose (%L) excreted as part of the lactulose:mannitol dual-sugar absorption test. Anthropometric measurements and urinary %L excretion were compared between the 2 intervention groups and the control group separately with the use of linear mixed model analyses for repeated measures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 331 children completed the clinical trial. Compliance with the study interventions was excellent, with >90% of the intervention flour consumed as intended. No significant effects on LAZ, change in LAZ, or weight-for-length z score were observed due to either intervention legume, compared to the control. %L was reduced with common bean consumption (effect estimate was -0.07 percentage points of lactulose, P = 0.0007).

Cross-sectional data from the Myanmar Demographic Health Survey 2015-2016 were used to examine risk factors for stunting, wasting, and underweight among children aged 0-59 months. The prevalence of stunting, wasting, and underweight was 29.0%, 7.3%, and 19.2%, respectively. Accounting for sampling design and weights, multivariable logistic regression was conducted with 35 household, maternal, and child characteristics. Current pregnancy and maternal height <145 cm, home delivery, child's small birth size recalled by mother, and older age (ref: 0-5 months) predicted both stunting and underweight. Larger than average birth size was protective for all stunting, wasting, and underweight. Maternal body mass index <18.5 kg m-2 was a common risk factor for wasting and underweight. Lower wealth quintiles, maternal engagement in nonagricultural occupation, and male child predicted stunting only. Younger child age and not receiving vitamin A supplementation in the previous 6 months were risk factors for wasting only. Regional variation was also seen, with a higher odds of stunting in the West-South Region, North-East States, and West States, compared with the Central Regions. In Myanmar, socio-economic and demographic factors, poor maternal nutritional status, and living in certain geographical locations are affecting children's undernutrition. It is recommended that interventions for growth faltering focus on the first 1,000 days of life; optimum maternal nutrition be ensured during and before pregnancy and at adolescence; societal support be provided for mothers in poverty or engaged in nonagriculture; and region-specific undernutrition pathways be understood."

These communities were previously included in a project to improve agricultural practices. We aimed to estimate the level of maternal and child undernutrition in the two study sites and compare findings to regional/national reports. We also examined associations with gender, household-structure and nutrition/health related variables. Households were selected using simple random sampling based on list of households obtained from local health posts. Mothers were interviewed via questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were taken from mothers-child pairs. Maternal undernutrition (% BMI<18.5) ranged from moderate (14% Zeway) to high (22% Halaba). In the children, stunting and underweight were very high (54% and 42% stunting, 36% and 21% underweight, in Halaba and Zeway, respectively). Up to 95% of Halaba and 85% of Zeway mothers reported \"same as usual\" or \"less than usual\" consumption patterns during their most recent pregnancy compared to periods of non-pregnancy. Mothers reported (61% in Halaba, 18% in Zeway) abstaining from consumption of certain nutritious foods for cultural reasons. Gender and socio-economic-demographic structure of the households, including imbalance of power, control of farm produce, physiological density, household size and dietary habits during pregnancy showed significant associations with maternal and child undernutrition (p<0.05). The levels of child and maternal undernutrition, particularly in children, were unexpected and of concern, given that a national nutrition program has been in place since 2008. The study provides insights for policy makers to improve women's education, reproductive health services for better family planning, and strengthen nutrition/health programs designed to target vulnerable segments of the population in these and other rural communities and districts with similar structure and demographics in Ethiopia."

In 2018, there was cholera outbreak in Ngorongoro district that was fueled by inadequate and unsafe water as well as poor sanitation and hygiene. We used an analytical cross-sectional study first to determine the proportion of households with access to WaSH and second to assess factors associated with coverage of household's access to WaSH. Methods included interviewing heads of the household to assess the availability of safe drinking water, use of unshared toilet/latrine by household members only, and the availability of functional handwashing facility. Eight percent of households had access to WaSH. Access to household's WaSH was positively associated with household's monthly income, education of heads of the household, and water use per person per week. To control water-related morbidities, there is a need to improve access to reliable safe drinking water, expand alternatives of households to earn more incomes, and enhance proper sanitation and hygiene services to rural areas and marginalized groups like the Maasai of Ngorongoro in Tanzania."

To obtain comparable data over time, earlier surveys should be reanalyzed using the WHO standards; however, reanalysis is impossible for older surveys since the raw data are not available. This paper provides algorithms for converting estimates of child malnutrition based on the NCHS reference into estimates based on the WHO standards.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty-eight surveys from the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition were analyzed using the WHO standards to derive estimates of underweight, stunting, wasting and overweight. The prevalences based on the NCHS reference were taken directly from the database. National/regional estimates with a minimum sample size of 400 children were used to develop the algorithms. For each indicator, a simple linear regression model was fitted, using the logit of WHO and NCHS estimates as, respectively, dependent and independent variables. The resulting algorithms were validated using a different set of surveys, on the basis of which the point estimate and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the predicted WHO prevalence were compared to the observed prevalence.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In total, 271 data points were used to develop the algorithms. The correlation coefficients (R2) were all greater than 0.90, indicating that most of the variability of the dependent variable is explained by the fitted model. The average difference between the predicted WHO estimate and the observed value was <0.5% for stunting, wasting and overweight. For underweight, the mean difference was 0.8%. The proportion of the 95% CI of the predicted estimate containing the observed prevalence was above 90% for all four indicators. The algorithms performed equally well for surveys without the entire age coverage 0 to 60 months.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      To obtain comparable data concerning child malnutrition, individual survey data should be analyzed using the WHO standards.

            "abstract": "Stunting is one of the most widespread forms of undernutrition found in Brazilian children. Some studies have revealed an association between this condition and overweight, whereas others report an association with wasting. The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that stunted children who live in the semiarid region of Alagoas (Brazil), one of the poorest areas of the country, tend to exhibit wasting and not overweight. The study followed a transversal design that involved a probability sample (n = 480 children <5 years of age). Anthropometric indexes were compared with the National Center for Health Statistics reference curves. A height-for-age deficit (Z < -2) was found in 9.6% of the children, whereas weight-for-height (WH) deficit was observed in only 0.6% of them. To test the hypothesis presented, the children were categorized according to quartiles (Q) of height-for-age. Shorter children (first Q; n = 121) were compared with the tallest ones (fourth Q; n = 121), taking into account variables of interest. The median WH value for the shorter children group (Z = -0.03) was significantly (P < 0.001) lower than that for children included in the group of taller children (Z = 0.62). The prevalence of risk of wasting (WH Z < -1) in the first Q was higher than that observed in the fourth Q (odds ratio, 3.03, 95% confidence interval, 1.2-8.3). Within the group of children studied, stunting was associated with WH deficit."

We applied a multilevel regression analysis on the Indonesian Demographic and Health Survey to examine the effects of drinking water and sanitation facilities at the household and community level on diarrhoea prevalence among children under five (n = 33,339). The role of the circumstances was explored by studying interactions between the water and sanitation variables and other risk factors. Diarrhoea prevalence was reported by 4820 (14.4%) children, who on average were younger, poorer and were living in a poorer environment. At the household level, piped water was significantly associated with diarrhoea prevalence (OR = 0.797, 95% CI: 0.692-0.918), improved sanitation had no direct effect (OR = 0.992, 95% CI: 0.899-1.096) and water treatment was not related to diarrhoea incidence (OR = 1.106, 95% CI: 0.994-1.232).

Our interaction analysis showed that the protective effects of better sanitation at the community level were increased by better drinking water at the community level. This illustrates the importance of improving both drinking water and sanitation simultaneously."

Verbal messages were administered to two intervention groups, one also received a plastic container with a tap to assist these activities. Indicators of compliance were the direct observation of soaking dishes and the presence of faecal streptococci from fingertip-rinses; the main outcome indicator was Escherichia coli contamination of stored water. The intervention group receiving the container was significantly better than the control for indicators of compliance (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01) and its stored water was significantly less contaminated (P less than 0.001).

            "abstract": "Highly prevalent conditions with multiple and complex underlying etiologies are a challenge to public health. Undernutrition, for example, affects 20% of children in the developing world. The cause and consequence of poor nutrition are multifaceted. Undernutrition has been associated with half of all deaths worldwide in children aged <5 years; in addition, its pernicious long-term effects in early childhood have been associated with cognitive and physical growth deficits across multiple generations and have been thought to suppress immunity to further infections and to reduce the efficacy of childhood vaccines. The Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health (MAL-ED) Study, led by the Fogarty International Center of the National Institutes of Health and the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, has been established at sites in 8 countries with historically high incidence of diarrheal disease and undernutrition. Central to the study is the hypothesis that enteropathogen infection contributes to undernutrition by causing intestinal inflammation and/or by altering intestinal barrier and absorptive function. It is further postulated that this leads to growth faltering and deficits in cognitive development. The effects of repeated enteric infection and undernutrition on the immune response to childhood vaccines is also being examined in the study. MAL-ED uses a prospective longitudinal design that offers a unique opportunity to directly address a complex system of exposures and health outcomes in the community-rather than the relatively rarer circumstances that lead to hospitalization-during the critical period of development of the first 2 years of life. Among the factors being evaluated are enteric infections (with or without diarrhea) and other illness indicators, micronutrient levels, diet, socioeconomic status, gut function, and the environment. MAL-ED aims to describe these factors, their interrelationships, and their overall impact on health outcomes in unprecedented detail, and to make individual, site-specific, and generalized recommendations regarding the nature and timing of possible interventions aimed at improving child health and development in these resource-poor settings."

There is a need for alternative analytic approaches to help identify, characterize and further refine the WASH components that are most important to STH reinfection.

Stunted children were more likely to be exposed to socio-economic risks (54% healthy, 64% wasted and 72% stunted; P = 0.001). Compared with healthy children, wasted and stunted children were more likely to be exposed to infant feeding (25% healthy, 40% wasted and 41% stunted; P = 0.02) and behaviour risks (24% healthy, 49% wasted, and 44% stunted; P = 0.004). Overall, wasted and stunted children were twice as likely to be exposed to more than three risks (23% healthy, 48% wasted, and 50% stunted; P = <0.001). They were also more likely to be exposed to more than three modifiable risks (dietary, handwashing and behaviour risks). Wasting and stunting are associated with exposure to multiple risk factors, many of which are potentially modifiable using targeted advice."

            "abstract": "Children in developing countries have an average length-for-age that is already below the World Health Organization standard at birth and show a further decline in linear growth over the first 24 months of life; however, complementary feeding interventions have only a modest impact on growth. Children living in conditions of poor sanitation and hygiene are frequently exposed to pathogenic microbes through feco-oral transmission. Acute diarrhea represents only the tip of the 'enteric disease iceberg', with a substantial underlying burden of chronic, subclinical enteropathy. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is characterized by disturbance in small intestinal structure and impaired gut barrier function, enabling microbial translocation and chronic systemic inflammation, which may impair growth. Gut damage appears to arise early in infancy and markers of intestinal inflammation, intestinal permeability and systemic immune activation are inversely associated with linear growth. Reducing feco-oral microbial transmission by improving water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) may theoretically prevent or ameliorate EED and improve linear growth; ongoing trials are exploring this hypothesis. Given the complex interplay of factors leading to stunting, multisectoral interventions are likely required. Improving WASH in addition to infant feeding may be one approach to improve the growth and developmental potential of infants in developing countries."

Data were collected using repeated cross-sectional surveys and longitudinal follow-up. The study area was found to have a low level of endemicity of dracunculiasis. While no impact could be demonstrated on overall period or point prevalence rates in the cross-sectional surveys, a prospective longitudinal survey showed a significant reduction in the percentage of person-fortnights positive for dracunculiasis in areas served by the project, while the control areas showed no such change. In the cross-sectional surveys it was found that, in the project villages, those persons drinking only borehole water had significantly lower period prevalence rates one year later than others. Moreover, those living further from the nearest borehole had higher rates of dracunculiasis. An impact of the project on diarrhoea morbidity was found only in limited sub-groups of the population. A greater association with water availability rather than quality was suggested for rates in young children.

We used data from 2018 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey, which is a nationally representative survey. Samples include 3502 and 5463 children under 24 months and between 24 and 59 months old, respectively. Three anthropometry indexes were used to determine child undernutrition: weight-for-height, height-for-age, and weight-for-age, which indicate wasting, stunting, and underweight, respectively. Three domains of maternal autonomy: decision-making, financial-control, and mobility, were operationalized using responses from mothers. Results from logistic regression analysis show that in unadjusted models, maternal decision-making autonomy and mobility were associated with undernutrition in both samples. After adding covariates, only associations between maternal decision-making autonomy and underweight in children 24-59 months old retained statistical significance. Findings show that gendered social inequalities are linked to differences in child nutritional outcomes. Future studies could investigate how feeding practices mediate associations between maternal autonomy and childhood undernutrition."

The prevalence is highest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially Africa and Asia. Food insecurity and associated undernutrition detrimentally affect health and socioeconomic development in the short and long term, for individuals, including children, and societies. Physical and economic access to food is crucial to ensure food security. Community-level interventions could be important to increase access to food in LMICs.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the effects of community-level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at-risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched for relevant studies in 16 electronic databases, including trial registries, from 1980 to September 2019, and updated the searches in six key databases in February 2020.

All population groups, adults and children, living in communities in LMICs exposed to community-level interventions aiming to improve food access were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children). Eligible interventions were broadly categorised into those that improved buying power (e.g. create income-generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); addressed food prices (e.g. vouchers and subsidies); addressed infrastructure and transport that affected physical access to food outlets; addressed the social environment and provided social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government).\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full texts of potentially eligible records, against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third author, if necessary. For each included study, two authors independently extracted data and a third author arbitrated disagreements. However, the outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by a biostatistician. We assessed risk of bias for all studies using the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group. We conducted meta-analyses if there was a minimum of two studies for interventions within the same category, reporting the same outcome measure and these were sufficiently homogeneous. Where we were able to meta-analyse, we used the random-effects model to incorporate any existing heterogeneity. Where we were unable to conduct meta-analyses, we synthesised using vote counting based on effect direction.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low-certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate-certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low-certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate-certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low-certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households. Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate-certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low-certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting. Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low-certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low-certainty evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate-certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low-certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity. None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The body of evidence indicates that UCTs can improve food security. Income generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. CCTs, UCTs, interventions that help generate income, interventions that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development, but not UCTs, which may be due to school attendance, healthcare visits and other conditionalities associated with CCTs."

Wasted children had lower FM, FFM, FMI and FFMI at 6 and 15 months compared with children with weight-for-length z (WLZ) ≥0. Generally, FFM and FFMI deficits increased with age, whereas FM and FMI deficits decreased, reflecting interactions between age and WLZ. For example, the FFM deficits were -0·99 (95 % CI -1·26, -0·72) kg at 6 months and -1·44 (95 % CI -1·69; -1·19) kg at 15 months (interaction, P&lt;0·05), while the FMI deficits were -2·12 (95 % CI -2·53, -1·72) kg/m2 at 6 months and -1·32 (95 % CI -1·77, -0·87) kg/m2 at 15 months (interaction, P&lt;0·05).

Much of the previous research investigating the effect of improved sanitation has been based on observational studies. Recent studies have executed a cluster-randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of improved sanitation. However, none of these recent studies achieved a sufficient level of latrine coverage. Without universal or at least a sufficient level of latrine coverage, a determination of the effect of improved latrines on the prevention of diarrheal disease is difficult. This cluster-randomized trial aims to explore the net effect of improved latrines on diarrheal prevalence and incidence in children under five and to investigate the effect on the diarrheal duration.\n    \n\n\n          Method/design:\n        \n      \n      A phase-in and factorial design will be used for the study.

Water supply and sanitation (WSS) policies are justified because of the usual efficiency criteria, but also major equity concerns. Yet, to date there are few scientific impact evaluations showing that WSS policies are effective in delivering social welfare outcomes. This lack of an evaluation culture is partly because WSS policies are characterized by diverse mechanisms, broad goals and the increasing importance of decentralized delivery, and partly because programme administrators are unaware of appropriate methods. We describe a protocol for a quasi-experimental evaluation of a community-demand-driven programme for water and sanitation in rural India, which addresses several evaluation challenges. After briefly reviewing policy and implementation issues in the sector, we describe key features of our protocol, including control group identification, pre-post measurement, programme theory, sample sufficiency and robust indicators. At its core, our protocol proposes to combine propensity score matching and difference-in-difference estimation. We conclude by briefly summarizing how quasi-experimental impact evaluations can address key issues in WSS policy design and when such evaluations are needed."

A cohort of rural children below 4 years of age was prospectively observed to determine the clinico-epidemiological aspects of mucoid diarrhoea and examine propensity to invasiveness.

Children aged 6-11 months had a higher incidence of mucoid diarrhoea (1.3 episodes/child/year) and the peak season occurred in June and July. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression showed that mucoid diarrhoea and bloody dysentery were closely similar in both clinical and laboratory findings, including raised faecal leucocyte count (> 10/high power microscope field [hpf]). However, abdominal pain occurred more frequently in bloody dysentery than in mucoid diarrhoea. Faecal leucocyte count (> 10/hpf) can therefore be used as an indicator for invasiveness of mucoid diarrhoea at the community level."

            "abstract": "Sanitation improvements have had limited effectiveness in reducing the spread of fecal pathogens into the environment. We conducted environmental measurements within a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh that implemented individual and combined water treatment, sanitation, handwashing (WSH) and nutrition interventions (WASH Benefits, NCT01590095). Following approximately 4 months of intervention, we enrolled households in the trial's control, sanitation and combined WSH arms to assess whether sanitation improvements, alone and coupled with water treatment and handwashing, reduce fecal contamination in the domestic environment. We quantified fecal indicator bacteria in samples of drinking and ambient waters, child hands, food given to young children, courtyard soil and flies. In the WSH arm, Escherichia coli prevalence in stored drinking water was reduced by 62% (prevalence ratio = 0.38 (0.32, 0.44)) and E. coli concentration by 1-log (Δlog10 = -0.88 (-1.01, -0.75)). The interventions did not reduce E. coli along other sampled pathways. Ambient contamination remained high among intervention households. Potential reasons include noncommunity-level sanitation coverage, child open defecation, animal fecal sources, or naturalized E. coli in the environment. Future studies should explore potential threshold effects of different levels of community sanitation coverage on environmental contamination."

            "abstract": "Existing empirical evidence suggests that the prevalence of undernutrition in remote and poor, rural areas is still high among Chinese children. While evidence reveals that undernutrition may detrimentally affect child development, studies focusing on rural Chinese preschoolers are sparse. Using the baseline survey of a preschool's free nutritious lunch pilot program, this study examined the relationship between child undernutrition and developmental outcomes among a preschool-aged sample in poor, rural areas of China. We conducted the baseline survey in Hunan province in south central China in September 2018. A total of 1293 preschoolers living in two (then) nationally designated poverty counties in rural Hunan served as our study sample. Children's nutritional statuses were measured using height-for-age z-score, weight-for-age z-score, and anemia, while their cognitive and socio-emotional skills were assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), respectively. We find that 33% of sample preschoolers were anemic, whereas the incidences of stunting and wasting were 11% and 2%, respectively. About 54% of the sample children had delay in at least one of the developmental domains measured in this study. Our findings provide suggestive evidence supporting that children from certain backgrounds tend to experience worse nutritional and developmental outcomes than their counterparts. After controlling for socioeconomic status, we observed that both anemia and stunting were negatively associated with children's cognitive performance; however, they were not associated with socio-emotional performance. As such, this study suggests that free lunch programs have the potential to change children's developmental trajectory in preschool. We believe that our results will contribute to the debate surrounding whether the nutritious lunch program in China should be expanded to the preschool education level."

            "abstract": "Community-based studies of diarrhea etiology and epidemiology were carried out from July 1982-June 1984 in 153 infants residing in a poor peri-urban community near Lima, Peru. Study infants had nearly 10 episodes of diarrhea in their first year of life. Diarrhea episodes were associated with organisms such as Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium. These organisms appeared to be transmitted to infants in the home through animal feces, through contaminated water and food, and by direct person-to-person contact. A particularly important route of transmission may have been weaning foods, which were often contaminated because of improper preparation and inadequate cleaning of utensils. Improved feeding practices, along with avoidance of animal feces and improved personal and domestic hygiene, should be considered important interventions in reducing the high incidence of diarrhea in infants in developing countries."

Therefore, this study reports the prevalence and intensity of HIs among inhabitants of the Khon Sawan district, Chaiyaphum province, and Kaeng Samnam Nang district, Nakhon Ratchasima province, which are located near the Chi River and Lahanna water reservoir, northeastern Thailand. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between July 31, 2018, and June 30, 2019, among rural villagers from 40 rural villages in 4 subdistricts. The participants were selected from the village enrolment list after proportional allocation of the total sample size. Faecal samples from 691 inhabitants were prepared using solvent-free faecal parasite concentrator, and helminths were then detected using a light microscope. Statistical analysis included the Chi-square test with Yates correction, and multivariable logistic regression was performed. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The prevalence of HIs was 2.03%. The most prevalent helminths were Opisthorchis viverrini (1.31%), followed by Strongyloides stercoralis (0.44%), Ascaris lumbricoides (0.29%), hookworm (0.15%), Teania spp. (0.15%) and one minute intestinal fluke (0.15%). Coinfections were identified in 2 cases for S. stercoralis and hookworm and 1 case for O. viverrini and S. stercoralis infection. All infected participants had a light intensity of HI. There was no significant difference between general characteristics for all HIs. The prevalence of HIs was not significantly associated with general characteristics. This study indicates that the infections result mainly from foodborne helminths and skin-penetrating nematodes. Therefore, interventions should concentrate on the personal hygiene of the population and improving sanitation to reduce HIs in this area."

Faecal samples were examined using direct smear, formalin-ether sedimentation, Kato-Katz, and Harada-Mori methods. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information on the demographic, socioeconomic, personal hygiene, and health status of the participants. Overall, 70.1% (95% CI = 67.4, 72.7) of the participants were infected with at least one of the STH species. The prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm infections was 63.1%, 61.8% and 11.5%, respectively. Moderate-to-heavy STH infections accounted for 61.3% of the total infections. Univariate and logistic regression analyses revealed different sets of risk factors, with age (> 10 years) being the significant risk factor of all three STH species. Moreover, other species-specific risk factors were identified including being a member of the Senoi tribe, family size (≥ 7 members), school size (150-250 pupils), maternal unemployment, unimproved source of drinking water, lacking improved toilet in the house, inadequate WASH facilities at school, not washing hands before eating, and not washing fruits before eating; presence of domestic animals, and not wearing shoes when outside. The high prevalence of STH infections found in the study population exceeds the WHO policy intervention threshold (20% prevalence). Thus, an innovative holistic approach should be adopted to control STH infections among these children as part of the efforts to improve the quality of life of the entire Orang Asli population. ."

Despite substantial progress in most health indicators, undernutrition remains high in Sri Lanka, with recent trends being unclear, owing to methodological differences in national surveys.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This study uses data from the 1987, 1993, 2000 and 2006-07 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the 2009 Nutrition and Food Security Survey (NFSS) to investigate trends and determinants of child undernutrition in Sri Lanka. The prevalence rates of stunting, underweight and wasting were re-estimated using the 2006 WHO growth standards to ensure consistency. Multivariate regression analysis was then undertaken to analyse the determinants of height-forage in children aged 9-23 months, and 24-59 months, and the relative impact of key factors was assessed using prediction models.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Stunting and wasting substantially improved from 1987 to 2000, but rates stagnated from 2000 to 2006/07. Whilst economic inequalities in under nutrition were greater than in most other countries, the multivariate analysis found that maternal height, household wealth, length of breast-feeding and altitude are significant determinants of stunting, but differences in child feeding practices and other factors were not. Of these, maternal height and household wealth had the most influence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results are consistent with the finding that food insecurity is the main driver of undernutrition, but more research is required to validate this. The strong relationship of child height with maternal height suggests that epigenetic factors, proxied by short maternal height, constrain the applicability of the WHO growth standards in Sri Lanka."

            "abstract": "Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) technologies and behaviors can prevent infection by soil-transmitted helminth species independently, but may also interact in complex ways. However, these interactions are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to characterize how school and home WaSH exposures were associated with Ascaris lumbricoides infection and to identify relevant interactions between separate WaSH technologies and behaviors. A study was conducted among 4,404 children attending 51 primary schools in western Kenya. We used multivariable mixed effects logistic regression to characterize how various WaSH exposures were associated with A. lumbricoides infection after annual school-based deworming. Few WaSH behaviors and technologies were independently associated with A. lumbricoides infection. However, by considering relevant interdependencies between variables, important associations were elucidated. The association between handwashing and A. lumbricoides depended largely upon the pupils' access to an improved water source. Among pupils who had access to improved water sources, A. lumbricoides prevalence was lower for those who handwashed both at school and home compared with neither place (odds ratio: 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.83; P = 0.01). This study contributes to a further understanding of the impact of WaSH on A. lumbricoides infection and shows the importance of accounting for interactions between WaSH technologies and behaviors."

This paper describes the findings of a Health Outcome Study, which aimed to assess the two-year effect of the FIT programme on the parasitological, weight, and oral health status of children attending schools implementing the programme in Cambodia, Indonesia and Lao PDR.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was a non-randomized clustered controlled trial with a follow-up period of two years. The intervention group consisted of children attending public elementary schools implementing the FIT programme, including daily group handwashing with soap and toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste, biannual school-based deworming; as well as construction of group handwashing facilities. Control schools implemented the regular government health education curriculum and biannual deworming. Per school, a random selection of six to seven-year-old grade-one students was drawn. Data on parasitological infections, anthropometric measurements, dental caries, odontogenic infections and sociodemographic characteristics were collected at baseline and at follow-up (24 months later).

            "abstract": "Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED) is a virtually ubiquitous, but poorly defined, disorder of the small intestine among people living in conditions of poverty, which begins early in infancy and persists. EED is characterized by altered gut structure and function, leading to reduced absorptive surface area and impaired intestinal barrier function. It is hypothesized that recurrent exposure to fecal pathogens and changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota initiate this process, which leads to a self-perpetuating cycle of pathology. We view EED as a primary gut disorder that drives chronic systemic inflammation, leading to growth hormone resistance and impaired linear growth. There is currently no accepted case definition or gold-standard biomarker of EED, making field studies challenging. The Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy (SHINE) trial in Zimbabwe is evaluating the independent and combined effects of a package of infant feeding and/or water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions on stunting and anemia. SHINE therefore provides an opportunity to longitudinally evaluate EED in a well-characterized cohort of infants, using a panel of biomarkers along the hypothesized causal pathway. Our aims are to describe the evolution of EED during infancy, ascertain its contribution to stunting, and investigate the impact of the randomized interventions on the EED pathway. In this article, we describe current concepts of EED, challenges in defining the condition, and our approach to evaluating EED in the SHINE trial."

The cost analysis did not prove lower costs for the new sanitation concepts in this special case in comparison with the conventional system. Economic benefits are demonstrated for the operation costs. The result will be reinforced by the consideration of an increase of the energy costs.

            "abstract": "Background: Determination of stunting and wasting always uses the WHO growth standard in Indonesia. However, it is believed that Indonesian children are \"below\" the global standard, thus the WHO standard is not reliable to present the actual prevalence. This study aims to compare the prevalence and determinants of stunting and underweight using WHO growth standard and national Indonesian growth reference. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out in Musi sub-district, East Nusa Tenggara province in July 2019. East Nusa Tenggara province had the highest prevalence of stunting and underweight in Indonesia. The study population were children under five, and total sampling method was used for this study. Length/height-for-age and weight-for-age were plotted using WHO standard and national Indonesian reference. Univariate and multivariate binomial logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. Results: The prevalence of stunting and underweight were higher for the WHO standard than the national reference (53.9% vs 10.7% and 29.17% vs 17.7%; all p < 0.001). After adjusted for confounding factors, when the WHO standard was used, determinants of stunting were maternal mid-upper arm circumference below 23.5cm and maternal height below 150cm; determinants of underweight were intrauterine growth restriction, young maternal age during pregnancy, and multiple parities. When the national reference was used, no determinants was found for stunting; the determinants of underweight were intrauterine growth restriction and maternal education. Conclusions: The WHO standard is not suitable for representing child growth in Musi sub-district. Future studies should be done to re-evaluate the prevalence and determinants of stunting and underweight nationwide using the national Indonesian reference."

            "abstract": "Traditional complementary foods (CF) with a low nutrient density have been implicated in growth faltering, stunting, and other adverse outcomes in children. The efficacy of 2 types of locally produced, micronutrient-fortified CF to prevent stunting of infants living in rural Vietnam was evaluated. In a village-randomized controlled study, 426 infants, 5 mo of age, received for 6 mo a fortified CF, either as an instant flour (FF) or a food complement (FC) in village canteens, or traditional CF at home (C). After 6 mo of intervention, weight, length, length-for-age Z-score (LAZ) and weight-for-age Z-score were greater in the 2 intervention groups compared with the C group, with an estimated effect of +0.22 LAZ for the FF group and +0.21 LAZ for the FC group. At the last follow-up, 18 mo after the intervention, there was no significant difference in height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) between the groups, even though the HAZ in the FF group was 0.17 greater than that in the C group (P = 0.18). In contrast, the weight-for-height Z-score and BMI Z-score, indices of ponderal growth, were greater in the FF group (-0.49 and -0.26, respectively) than in the FC group (-0.73 and -0.49, respectively), with Z-scores in the C group intermediate and not significantly different from the others. This study shows that regular provision of locally produced CF fortified with micronutrients partly stopped growth faltering in Vietnamese infants, with differential effects on long-term length and ponderal growth. Providing only micronutrients instead of a complete array of nutrients might result in only short-term length growth benefits."

The results show that Cryptosporidium sp and Isospora belli were found respectively with a prevalence of 7.7% and 3.9%. Only one case of mixed infestation between theses two parasites has been found. Coccidia were the most recurrent parasites found in diarrhoea after flagellates. Parasitism by coccidia was not related to AIDS serological status of the children.

Exposures included mild-moderate malnutrition, household crowding, and low parental literacy. The study population consisted of 106 toddler-aged children (18-25 months) who were free of ALRI for at least 4 weeks before beginning a 1-year follow-up period. Subjects were visited weekly for morbidity information and monthly for anthropometric measurement. Being underweight (weight-for-age < 80 per cent of expected) was positively associated with ALRI, as was stunting (height-for-age < 90 per cent of expected). No association was found for acute wasting (weight-for-height < 90 per cent of expected). Having more than five siblings or parents with low reading skills were also risk factors. These data suggest that improving nutrition and parental literacy may contribute to lowering the incidence of acute lower respiratory infections. Interventions include breastfeeding, full immunization, diets adequate in quality and quantity, and early treatment through parental recognition of serious infections."

Rising cellphone use in low-resource settings represents an opportunity to replace in-person counselling visits with phone calls; however, questions remain on relative effectiveness. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of two options for delivering a World Vision infant and young child feeding (IYCF) counselling programme: (1) traditional Positive Deviance/Hearth (PDH) programme with in-person visits or (2) PDH with Interactive Voice Calling (PDH-IVC) which integrates phone calls to replace 62.5% of face-to-face interaction between caregivers and volunteers, compared to the standard of care (SOC). We conducted a longitudinal cluster-randomised controlled trial in 361 children 6-23 months. We used an adjusted difference-in-difference approach using baseline, midline (3 months) and endline (12 months) surveys to evaluate the impact on child growth among the three groups. At baseline, nearly a third of children were underweight, and over half were food insecure. At midline the PDH group and the PDH-IVC groups had improved weight-for-age z-scores (0.13 DID, p = 0.011; 0.13 DID, p = 0.02, respectively) and weight-for-height z-score (0.16 DID, p = 0.038; 0.24 DID, p = 0.002), relative to SOC. There were no differences in child height-for-age z-scores. At endline, the impact was sustained only in the PDH-IVC group for weight-for-age z-score (0.14 DID, p = 0.049), and the prevalence of underweight declined by 12.8 percentage points (p = 0.036), relative to SOC. Integration of phone-based IYCF counselling is a potentially promising solution to reduce the burden of in-person visits; however, the modest improvements suggest the need to combine it with other strategies to improve child nutrition."

We found that 1,124 of 14,761 children (7.61%) had H. nana infection, a likely underestimate given that only a single stool sample was examined by microscopy for diagnosis. The strongest association with infection was lack of adequate water (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82-2.48) and sanitation infrastructure in the house (aPR 1.94, 95% CI 1.64-2.29). One quarter of those tested did not have a bathroom or latrine at home, which doubled their likelihood of infection. Similarly, one quarter did not have piped public water to the house, which also increased the likelihood of infection.

This article reviews current knowledge of the major water- and excreta-related diseases and the potential impact of improved sanitary facilities on health. Four health indicators are considered--diarrhoeal diseases, soil-transmitted nematode infections, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease) and nutritional status. These constitute some of the major health problems in the developing world. Although there are large variations in morbidity and mortality rates both between and within geographical areas, some global estimates are presented. Children under 5 experience an average of 3.4 episodes of diarrhoea per year and a diarrhoeal mortality rate estimated at 12 per 1,000, leading to 4 million diarrhoea-associated deaths per year. Diarrhoea may also be associated with a sizeable proportion of adult deaths. Approximately 1,000 million people are believed to be infected with Ascaris lumbricoides, 900 million with hookworms and 500 million with Trichuris trichiura. Dracunculiasis, primarily occurring in remote rural areas, is known to be greatly underreported, but estimates suggest that 10 million people are infected each year. Malnutrition is widely prevalent and a common cause or associated cause of child death. The complex issues involved in measuring the health impact of improved sanitary facilities and the mechanisms by which these impacts may occur are discussed. These complexities, plus the differences in sanitary improvements and environmental settings, and the diverse nature of the health indicators considered, all contribute substantial variations in the health impact observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Handwashing practice is difficult to assess but the microbiological analysis of hands shows promise as an indicator of this behaviour. Most methods for isolating bacteria from the hands have been developed for use in hospitals in order to investigate the spread of nosocomial infections. However, reliable and inexpensive methods which need only limited expertise are needed for use in developing countries where diarrhoeal diseases remain a major health risk. Techniques for sampling hands and bacteriological analysis methods are discussed with special emphasis on practical considerations for conducting tests in developing countries. Several studies have used these methods successfully and have investigated hygiene behaviour and how living conditions affect behaviour and the role of hands in diarrhoeal disease transmission.

As a result of their cost-effectiveness, mass school-based deworming programs are becoming routine practice in developing countries. However, experimental and clinical evidence suggests that anthelmintic treatments may increase susceptibility to other gastrointestinal infections caused by bacteria, viruses, or protozoa. Hypothesizing that anthelmintics may increase diarrheal infections in treated children, we aim to evaluate the impact of anthelmintics on the incidence of diarrheal disease caused by viral and bacterial pathogens in school children in southern Vietnam.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effects of albendazole treatment versus placebo on the incidence of viral- and bacterial-induced diarrhea in 350 helminth-infected and 350 helminth-uninfected Vietnamese school children aged 6-15 years. Four hundred milligrams of albendazole, or placebo treatment will be administered once every 3 months for 12 months. At the end of 12 months, all participants will receive albendazole treatment. The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of diarrheal disease assessed by 12 months of weekly active and passive case surveillance.

Physical domestic violence victimization was self-reported by the women. Aspects of nutritional status included in this study were anemia and underweight. Anemia was measured with a blood test for hemoglobin. Underweight was calculated from anthropometric measurements and was determined as body mass index for women, and it included stunting and wasting for children. Results indicate associations of multiple incidents of domestic violence in the previous year with anemia (odds ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.18) and underweight (odds ratio = 1.21, 95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.29) in women and a suggested relation among children. Possible mechanisms for this relation include withholding of food as a form of abuse and stress-mediated influences of domestic violence on nutritional outcomes. These findings indicate that reducing domestic violence is important not only from a moral and intrinsic perspective but also because of the instrumental health benefits likely to accrue."

            "abstract": "Malnourished children in low-income contexts usually suffer from environmental enteric dysfunction, which is damage to the intestines caused by chronic exposure to bacterial pathogens from feces hypothesized to contribute to stunting. Many intervention studies are piloting \"Baby water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)\" to help rural farming families reduce infant and young children's (IYC's) exposure to human and free-range livestock feces. One proposed Baby WASH intervention is a play-yard, which consists of a baby-proofed structure (i.e., playpen) that caregivers can place IYC into while doing chores around the household yard. This article describes the pilot development and assessment of a community-built Baby WASH play-yard and a plastic play-yard intervention with 21 caregivers of 6- to 24-month-old IYC in rural Zambia. A modified Trials of Improved Practices approach was used to conduct three visits in each household: an introductory visit during which play-yard use was explained, a second visit consisting of a semi-structured interview and a session of behavioral counseling, and a final visit which included a 2-hour observation of play-yard use. The second and final visits also included 24-hour recalls, and all three visits included spot observations of play-yard use. Reports from caregivers suggest that the community-built play-yard protected IYC from ingesting soil and livestock feces. Barriers to intervention use included caregivers' WASH beliefs and practices, community reactions, and play-yard maintenance. More work is needed to examine the role of women's time use in their home environment, community reactions to the intervention, and the biological efficacy to reduce microbial ingestion."

Special emphasis was placed on (i) assessing infections by Entamoeba histolytica/E. dispar, Giardia duodenalis and by intestinal worms, (ii) looking for associations between these parasites, and (iii) looking for associations between these parasites and commonly perceived intestinal signs and symptoms. Complete questionnaire results, intestinal helminth infections derived from 4 Kato-Katz thick smears, and intestinal protozoa infections assessed on a single day by a formalin-ether concentration procedure were obtained from 209 children (87%). A logistic regression modelling approach showed that an infection with E. histolytica/E. dispar was significantly associated with an Entamoeba coli infection. However, for G. duodenalis, hookworm and Ascaris lumbricoides, no association was found between any of these parasites and other intestinal parasites. In a multivariate analysis reported diarrhoea was the only symptom positively associated with an E. histolytica/E. dispar infection (P = 0.028). Its diagnostic performance showed a low sensitivity (28%), a high specificity (85%) and moderate positive and negative predictive values (52% and 67%, respectively). Surprisingly, reported 'turning stomach' was less often reported by children infected with G. duodenalis (borderline significance, P = 0.057).

            "title": "Wasting and stunting--similarities and differences: policy and programmatic implications.",
            "abstract": "Wasting and stunting are often presented as two separate forms of malnutrition requiring different interventions for prevention and/or treatment. These two forms of malnutrition, however, are closely related and often occur together in the same populations and often in the same children. Wasting and stunting are both associated with increased mortality, especially when both are present in the same child. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these two different forms of malnutrition is needed to design efficient programs. A greatly reduced muscle mass is characteristic of severe wasting, but there is indirect evidence that it also occurs in stunting. A reduced muscle mass increases the risk of death during infections and also in many other different pathological situations. Reduced muscle mass may represent a common mechanism linking wasting and stunting with increased mortality. This suggests that to decrease malnutrition-related mortality, interventions should aim at preventing both wasting and stunting, which often share common causes. Also, this suggests that treatment interventions should focus on children who are both wasted and stunted and therefore have the greatest deficits in muscle mass, instead of focusing on one or the other form of malnutrition. Interventions should also focus on young infants and children, who have a low muscle mass in relation to body weight to start with. Using mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) to select children in need of treatment may represent a simple way to target young wasted and stunted children efficiently in situations where these two conditions are present. Wasting is also associated with decreased fat mass. A decreased fat mass is frequent but inconsistent in stunting. Fat secretes multiple hormones, including leptin, which may have a stimulating effect on the immune system. Depressed immunity resulting from low fat stores may also contribute to the increased mortality observed in wasting. This may represent another common mechanism linking wasting and stunting with increased mortality in situations where stunting is associated with reduced fat mass. Leptin may also have an effect on bone growth. This may explain why wasted children with low fat stores have reduced linear growth when their weight-for-height remains low. It may also explain the frequent association of stunting with previous episodes of wasting. Stunting, however, can occur in the absence of wasting and even in overweight children. Thus, food supplementation should be used with caution in populations where stunting is not associated with wasting and low fat stores."

This research, therefore, studied the situation, to determine the magnitude and dimensions of the problem aimed at making policy level stakeholders aware of child faeces management systems and so, inform evidence-based implementation of child and health-related programmes in Nigeria.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study utilized an exploratory cross-sectional design and a multi-stage sampling technique to identify 300 respondents from 12 randomly selected streets from 4 wards in Ife central local government area. The study collected data with a pretested questionnaire which included direct observations of child defecation practices and existing toilet facilities. Cleaned data were analyzed by IBM-SPSS version 20 with child faeces management outcomes as the dependent variable.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean age of respondents' and monthly income (mode) were 30.8 ± 7.5 years and ₦10,000.00 ($28.60). Most respondents were mothers to the under five children (84.7%), had a secondary education (72.0%) and were semi-skilled (57.0%). The caregivers had access to improved water sources (93.7%), improved toilets (64.3%), with 64% and 53.7% having above average scores in knowledge and attitudes, respectively. In the study, 19.7% and 69.0% of caregivers practiced safe disposal of faeces passed by the under five child during the day and at night respectively, though most caregivers (94.3%) omitted steps in the safe management of child faeces chain. The under five diarrhoea prevalence rate was 13.7% and unsanitary passage of child faeces is associated with four folds likelihood of having diarrhoea (p = 0.001). The caregivers whose under five children practiced safe sanitation were rich (p = 0.009) and knowledge was significantly associated with ownership of household toilet (P = 0.037), night faeces management chain practice (P < 0.001) and disposal of anal cleaning materials (P = 0.002). Handwashing was significantly associated with household toilet (P < 0.001), wealth (P < 0.001), under five child defecation preferences during the day (P < 0.001) and at night (P = 0.008).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The high knowledge and positive attitudes exhibited by the caregivers were at variance with practice. Where under five children defecate during the day were influenced by the disposal of their anal cleaning materials, distance to the toilet and caregivers' education. The findings highlight the dangers of unsanitary disposal of child faeces and the need to strengthen the related policies that can increase caregivers awareness and practice at all levels and in all livelihood domains."

To examine the magnitude and duration of the association of early childhood enteric infections with growth faltering in later childhood, we investigated associations of early childhood diarrhoea (0-2 years) and intestinal helminthiases with nutritional status from age 2 to 7 years.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twice-weekly diarrhoea surveillance and quarterly anthropometrics were followed from 1989 to 1998 in 119 children born into a Northeast Brazilian shantytown.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Diarrhoea burdens at 0-2 years old were significantly associated with growth faltering at ages 2-7 years, even after controlling for nutritional status in infancy, helminthiases at 0-2 years old, family income, and maternal education by Pearson correlation, multivariate linear regression, and repeat measures analysis. The average 9.1 diarrhoeal episodes before age 2 years was associated with a 3.6 cm (95% CI : 0.6-6.6 cm) growth shortfall at age 7 years. Early childhood helminthiasis was also associated with linear growth faltering and a further 4.6 cm shortfall (95% CI : 0.8-7.9 cm) at age 7 years.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Early childhood diarrhoea and helminthiases independently associate with substantial linear growth shortfalls that continue beyond age 6 years.

Geometric mean increases in colony forming units per two hands ranged from 50 (cleaning dishes) to 6310 (food preparation). Multivariate modelling of hand faecal indicator bacteria as a function of activities recently performed shows that food handling, exiting the household premises and longer time since last handwashing with soap are positively associated with bacterial levels on hands, while bathing is negatively associated. Genetic markers of Bacteroidales, enterovirus and pathogenic E. coli were each detected on a subset of mothers' hands.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Escherichia coli and enterococci on hands can be significantly increased by various household activities, including those involving the use of soap and water. Thus, faecal indicator bacteria should be considered highly variable when used as indicators of handwashing behaviour. This work corroborates hands as important vectors of disease among Tanzanian mothers and highlights the difficulty of good personal hygiene in an environment characterized by the lack of networked sanitation and water supply services."

Similar samples were collected from cows in three other dairy herds experiencing non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the survey period. Coronavirus was the only enteric pathogen identified by immune electron microscopy (IEM) in all six outbreaks, occurring in 26 of 29 (90 per cent) of the affected cows and in one of 11 normal cows from the same herds. Nineteen of 26 affected cows (73 per cent) developed greater than four-fold increases in neutralising antibody titres to the Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus, compared with two of eight normal cows in the same herds. No cows showed greater than four-fold increases in antibody titres to bovine virus diarrhoea virus. None of the cows from the three herds with non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea shed coronavirus in faeces detectable by IEM or developed greater than two-fold rises in coronavirus antibody titres in paired sera. No enteric pathogens were identified in two of the herds. However, two cows in the third herd shed a group B rotavirus detected by IEM. These findings provide additional evidence for a possible role for bovine coronavirus in the aetiology of winter dysentery. Furthermore, this is the first report of a group B rotavirus associated with diarrhoea in adult cattle."

A high proportion of children were stunted (23. 8%), underweight (24.1%), or had low MUAC (21.6%). Although rural living, poor health, the use of unprotected water supplies, lack of charcoal as fuel, lack of milk consumption, and lack of personal hygiene were shown as risk factors for marasmus and underweight, different factors were found to be associated with risk of stunting and low MUAC, despite these three parameters being significantly correlated. For stunting the risk factors were: age of the child, poor health, prolonged breastfeeding (from >18 months to <24 months), low socioeconomic status of the family, poor education of the mother of infants <12 months, lack of paraffin as fuel, consumption of food of low energy density (<350 kcal/100 g dry matter), presence of eye pathology, and consumption of small meals. Risk factors for low MUAC were poor health, lack of meat and cow's milk consumption, low intake of energy from fat, and less well educated and older mothers. Food taboos had no influence on any of the anthropometric measurements. Although 93.1% of the children had been immunized against tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, and measles and showed better general health than children who were not immunized, there was a high prevalence of infection in the week preceding the survey interview, including diarrhea (23.0%), malaria (32.3%), or cough/influenza (72.8%).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This first account of dietary and environmental risk factors involved in the etiology of early childhood malnutrition in Uganda indicates differences in risk factors for marasmus and underweight compared with stunting and low MUAC.

The WASH Benefits Bangladesh trial implemented a multicomponent sanitation intervention that led to a 39% reduction in the prevalence of diarrhea among children and a 25% reduction for ARI, measured 1 to 2 years after intervention implementation. We measured longer-term intervention effects on these outcomes between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation, including periods with differing intensity of behavioral promotion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      WASH Benefits Bangladesh was a cluster-randomized controlled trial of water, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrition interventions (NCT01590095). The sanitation intervention included provision of or upgrades to improved latrines, sani-scoops for feces removal, children's potties, and in-person behavioral promotion. Promotion was intensive up to 2 years after intervention initiation, decreased in intensity between years 2 to 3, and stopped after 3 years. Access to and reported use of latrines was high in both arms, and latrine quality was significantly improved by the intervention, while use of child feces management tools was low. We enrolled a random subset of households from the sanitation and control arms into a longitudinal substudy, which measured child health with quarterly visits between 1 to 3.5 years after intervention implementation. The study period therefore included approximately 1 year of high-intensity promotion, 1 year of low-intensity promotion, and 6 months with no promotion. We assessed intervention effects on diarrhea and ARI prevalence among children <5 years through intention-to-treat analysis using generalized linear models with robust standard errors. Masking was not possible during data collection, but data analysis was masked. We enrolled 720 households (360 per arm) from the parent trial and made 9,800 child observations between June 2014 and December 2016. Over the entire study period, diarrheal prevalence was lower among children in the sanitation arm (11.9%) compared to the control arm (14.5%) (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.81, 95% CI 0.66, 1.00, p = 0.05; prevalence difference [PD] = -0.027, 95% CI -0.053, 0, p = 0.05). ARI prevalence did not differ between sanitation (21.3%) and control (22.7%) arms (PR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.82, 1.05, p = 0.23; PD = -0.016, 95% CI -0.043, 0.010, p = 0.23). There were no significant differences in intervention effects between periods with high-intensity versus low-intensity/no promotion. Study limitations include use of caregiver-reported symptoms to define health outcomes and limited data collected after promotion ceased.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The observed effect of the WASH Benefits Bangladesh sanitation intervention on diarrhea in children appeared to be sustained for at least 3.5 years after implementation, including 1.5 years after heavy promotion ceased. Existing latrine access was high in the study setting, suggesting that improving on-site latrine quality can deliver health benefits when latrine use practices are in place.

Overall, tracheo-bronchial swabs had the higher PCV2 load followed by serum, tonsillar, nasal, faecal and, finally, urinary swabs. PCV2 genome was also detected in different proportions in all three categories of pigs; in all tested sites, viral load means were significantly higher (P<or=0.02) in animals with PMWS (Group A pigs) than in animals without PMWS (Group B and C pigs). Therefore, the more severe the lesions, the higher amounts of viral genome by ISH, and the higher PCV2 load in serum and swab specimens. Except for the tracheo-bronchial swab, no significant differences (p>0.05) were observed among tested specimens when age-groups (pigs younger than 1.5 months, and equal or older than 1.5 months of age) were compared. In summary, PCV2 is presumably excreted through respiratory (nasal and tracheo-bronchial) and oral (tonsillar) secretions, urine and faeces of both PMWS and non-PMWS affected pigs, with higher viral loads being associated with the presence of PMWS lesions."

Therefore, launching community based nutritional education programs, implementing school feeding and strengthening economic level of the communities are essential to reduce the problems."

            "abstract": "The first section of this paper reviews what is known about the roles of specific nutrients in the general linear growth faltering that occurs in developing countries. Those reviewed are energy, protein, zinc, iron, copper, iodine and vitamin A. For none of these nutrients was there clear, consistent evidence that supplementation with the nutrient benefited linear growth. Rather, interventions with each specific nutrient had a positive effect on length gain in some studies, while in others these affected only weight gain or had no effect. Reasons for these conflicting results are suggested, including the strong probability that growth is limited by multiple, simultaneous deficiencies in many populations. This point is illustrated with data from the Nutrition Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) and other reports. Most interventions with single nutrients have been tested on children older than the age when linear growth faltering is most rapid, that is, within a few months of birth. Possible reasons why growth stunting begins so early in life are presented, but these are mostly hypothetical because of the paucity of information on this topic."

This study utilizes two different yet complimentary system-analysis approaches to analyze correlations among environmental and demographic variables, environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), and child height-for-age (stunting metric) in Guatemala. Two descriptive models constructed around applicable environmental and demographic factors on child height-for-age and EED were analyzed using Network Analysis (NA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Data from two populations of children between the age of three months and five years were used. The first population (n = 2103) was drawn from the Food for Peace Baseline Survey conducted by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in 2012, and the second population (n = 372) was drawn from an independent survey conducted by the San Vicente Health Center in 2016. The results from the NA of the height-for-age model confirmed pathogen exposure, nutrition, and prenatal health as important, and the results from the NA of the EED model confirmed water source, water treatment, and type of sanitation as important. The results from the SEM of the height-for-age model confirmed a statistically significant correlation among child height-for-age and child-mother interaction (-0.092, p = 0.076) while the SEM of the EED model confirmed the statistically significant correlation among EED and type of water treatment (-0.115, p = 0.013). Our approach supports important efforts to understand the complex set of factors associated with child stunting among communities sharing similarities with San Vicente."

It was a cross-sectional study, carried out in 17 villages, in 2014. For evaluation of nutritional status we used 2006 growth standards to assign height-for-age (stunting)Z-scores (Z), weight-for-age Z (underweight) and weight-for-height Z (wasting and overweight), using the software WHO-Anthro and WHO-AnthroPlus. Short stature (SS) was defined as values lower 145cm for mothers over the age of 18. The Poisson regression was made in R software. Among children under 60 months the prevalences were: stunting 83.8%; underweight 50%; wasting 5.4%; and overweight 2.7%. In 59.5% of the children there was severe stunting, and 68.1% of the mothers were SS. Prevalence ratio (PR) for severe stunting was higher in age group 36-59 months, in comparison with age group 0.1-23 (PR = 1.3; CI 95%: 1.1-2.3), as did also children of mothers with SS, when compared to the children of mothers without SS (PR = 2.1; CI 95%; 1.2-3.6). The alarming rates of stunting and severe stunting reveal the seriousness of the nutritional situation children. The association of severe stunting in infants and in mothers reflects the intergenerational nature of the problem."

A confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor, serotype Inaba cultured from a stool sample. We reviewed medical records to find cases. We conducted a case-control study to compare exposures among confirmed case-persons and asymptomatic controls, matched by village and age-group. We conducted environmental assessments.

The outbreak occurred in 80 villages and affected all age groups; the highest attack rate occurred in the 5-14 year age group (4.1/10,000). The outbreak started in Bwera Sub-County bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo and spread eastward through sustained community transmission. The first case-persons were involved in cross-border trading. The case-control study, which involved 49 confirmed cases and 201 controls, showed that 94% (46/49) of case-persons compared with 79% (160/201) of control-persons drank water without boiling or treatment (ORM-H=4.8, 95% CI: 1.3-18).

            "abstract": "This review deals with waterborne zoonotic helminths, many of which are opportunistic parasites spreading directly from animals to man or man to animals through water that is either ingested or that contains forms capable of skin penetration. Disease severity ranges from being rapidly fatal to low-grade chronic infections that may be asymptomatic for many years. The most significant zoonotic waterborne helminthic diseases are either snail-mediated, copepod-mediated or transmitted by faecal-contaminated water. Snail-mediated helminthiases described here are caused by digenetic trematodes that undergo complex life cycles involving various species of aquatic snails. These diseases include schistosomiasis, cercarial dermatitis, fascioliasis and fasciolopsiasis. The primary copepod-mediated helminthiases are sparganosis, gnathostomiasis and dracunculiasis, and the major faecal-contaminated water helminthiases are cysticercosis, hydatid disease and larva migrans. Generally, only parasites whose infective stages can be transmitted directly by water are discussed in this article. Although many do not require a water environment in which to complete their life cycle, their infective stages can certainly be distributed and acquired directly through water. Transmission via the external environment is necessary for many helminth parasites, with water and faecal contamination being important considerations. Human behaviour, particularly poor hygiene, is a major factor in the re-emergence, and spread of parasitic infections. Also important in assessing the risk of infection by water transmission are human habits and population density, the prevalence of infection in them and in alternate animal hosts, methods of treating sewage and drinking water, and climate. Disease prevention methods, including disease surveillance, education and improved drinking water treatment are described."

Differences in prevalence of Strongylida, Trichuris and Nematodirus were found between farms with goats on pasture and those where animals were permanently housed indoor. Strongyloides spp. showed higher values of prevalence in goats housed indoor. With regard to the sampling seasons, Strongylida eggs were more prevalent in summer while Nematodirus in winter in goats at pasture. Strongyloides occurred more frequently in autumn in stabled goats."

            "abstract": "The causes of acute malnutrition-or \"wasting\"-are complex, and a better understanding of the underlying drivers is necessary in order to design effective interventions. Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) practices may play a fundamental role in acute malnutrition, but more research is needed to confirm this relationship. We investigated the association between WASH practices and acute malnutrition among children 6 to 59 months of age in rural Ethiopia, making use of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey. Descriptive statistics were used to assess the WASH status of all rural children. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations between nutritional status and WASH. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to adjust for confounders. A total of 7,209 children were included in the analysis, of which 867 (12.0%) were acutely malnourished. Proper toilet facilities (AOR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.46, 0.86]) and a water source close to home (AOR = 0.71, 95% CI [0.61, 0.83]) were associated with a lower prevalence of wasting. A safe water source for drinking (COR = 1.03, 95% CI [0.89, 1.19]) and a safe disposal of the child's stool (AOR = 0.97, 95% CI [0.84, 1.13]) were not significantly associated with acute malnutrition. These results suggest that WASH practices are related to acute malnutrition. Future studies-in particular intervention studies-should investigate whether improving WASH practices is effective in reducing malnutrition in infants and young children."

            "abstract": "Poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) conditions are hypothesized to contribute to environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a subclinical condition that may be associated with chronic undernutrition and impaired linear growth. We evaluated the effect of a combined water and sanitation intervention on biomarkers of EED, and then assessed associations of biomarkers of EED with height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), in children under five. We conducted a sub-study within a matched cohort study of a household-level water and sanitation infrastructure intervention in rural Odisha, India, in which we had observed an effect of the intervention on HAZ. We collected stool samples (N = 471) and anthropometry data (N = 209) for children under age 5. We analyzed stool samples for three biomarkers of EED: myeloperoxidase (MPO), neopterin (NEO), and α1-anti-trypsin (AAT). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between the intervention and each biomarker of EED and between each biomarker and HAZ. The intervention was inversely associated with AAT (-0.25 log μg/ml, p = 0.025), suggesting a protective effect on EED, but was not associated with MPO or NEO. We observed an inverse association between MPO and HAZ (-0.031 per 1000 ng/ml MPO, p = 0.0090) but no association between either NEO or AAT and HAZ. Our results contribute evidence that a transformative WaSH infrastructure intervention may reduce intestinal permeability, but not intestinal inflammation and immune activation, in young children. Our study also adds to observational evidence of associations between intestinal inflammation and nutritional status, as measured by HAZ, in young children.

The study involved 1206 children aged 2-12 years in 21 villages in Myanmar [Burma] starting in August 1984. The intervention and non-intervention villages were comparable regarding almost all the important baseline variables, including prevalences of Ascaris infection (80.8 vs 83.0%) and of malnutrition of grade 2 and above for height-for-age (58.4 vs 55.8%) and for weight-for-age (48.2 vs 47.8%). The intensity of Ascaris infection was related to the degree of malnutrition. A significant increment of height gain was found, starting after the 6th month, and of weight gain after the 24th month, of the study among the treated 2-10 years old children when compared with the non-treated ones. By the end of 24 months, the height and weight gains per child were 0.65 cm and 0.93 kg respectively. Lesser increments in height-for-age and weight-for-age were also observed after successive treatments among the treated children with initially higher mean worm burdens. The findings are discussed in the context of causal relationship between ascariasis and malnutrition in children."

An in-depth analysis of the effect of unfavourable ecologies on maternal and child malnutrition was carried out. Data were from a longitudinal data set comprising a nationally representative data sample collected in 2014 and the Food Security Nutrition Surveillance Project (FSNSP) conducted in 2011 and 2012. Anthropometric indices were used to assess the nutritional status of mothers and under-five children. The key variables of interest were food seasonality and geographical location. Data were analysed using the General Linear Model and multinomial and binary logistic regression analysis. Panel data analysis showed that household income was not equal across agro-ecological zones, indicating that the fragility of the environment affects a household's ability to access food, and thus the nutritional status of mothers and children. Coastal areas of Bangladesh were found to be less dependent on agriculture, particularly cultivation, which had diminished during last few decades. Per capita income has been increasing in coastal areas of Bangladesh, led by remittance (money sent home by migrant workers) growing at 8% per year against 6% in other areas. Regression analysis showed that a household in a coastal zone earned 19% less than one in more favourable zones. Although the income from farm practices was found to be lower in unfavourable areas, the deficiency was compensated by increased non-farm incomes. The results from the FSNSP data showed that overall the rates of stunting and wasting among under-five children were 37% and 11.7%, respectively, and nearly 28% of mothers suffered from undernutrition. A highly significant regional heterogeneity in undernutrition was found, with alarmingly high levels in the Haor Basin and coastal belt areas. There were significantly higher rates of underweight and wasting in the monsoon season compared with the two harvest seasons among children under the age of five. The findings stress the importance of bringing geographical location and seasonality thinking into debates on hunger and nutrition in Bangladesh."

Other species, as camels, cattle, donkey, sheep and goat have been also proposed as reservoirs for human infections. The parasite has a direct life cycle, being transmitted by the faecal-oral route. This type of cycle and the large number of host species imply an important potential for zoonotic transmission of the parasite. Infections are most commonly found in tropical and temperate regions, with prevalence up to 100% in pigs; high prevalence values have been also recorded in some non-human primates and camels. In humans, prevalence is usually under 10% in the population at risk. The main epidemiological factors involved in the transmission of this parasite include close contact with pigs, lack of basic sanitation infrastructures (water supply, wastewater disposal) and hygiene. Individual health status, intestinal microbiota and diet are also important for the onset of the infection. Outbreaks caused by this parasite are rare; those reported to date were related to poor hygienic conditions or to catastrophic natural disasters. Balantioides coli infections can be asymptomatic and symptomatic, which can be chronic (with intermittent diarrhoea), or acute (a dysenteric form which can be life-threatening). Efective treatments include tetracycline, iodoquinol and 5-nitroimidazole compounds (metronidazole, secnidazole). The main effective individual preventive measure is the use of disinfected water for drinking and other uses. Adequate water supply infrastructures, proper disposal of wastewater and animal faeces, and regular monitoring programs on farms will help limit transmission."

Furthermore, many common WASH interventions are not specifically designed to protect babies in the first 3 years of life, when gut health and linear growth are established. We review evidence linking WASH, anemia, and child growth, and highlight pathways through which WASH may affect early child development, primarily through inflammation, stunting, and anemia. Environmental enteropathy, a prevalent subclinical condition of the gut, may be a key mediating pathway linking poor hygiene to developmental deficits. Current early child development research and programs lack evidence-based interventions to provide a clean play and infant feeding environment in addition to established priorities of nutrition, stimulation, and child protection. Solutions to this problem will require appropriate behavior change and technologies that are adapted to the social and physical context and conducive to infant play and socialization.

Overall, only 7.3% of participants were infected with intestinal protozoa, among which prevalence of Blastocystis hominis, Entamoeba spp. and Trichomonas hominis were 6.0%, 1.1% and 0.3%, respectively; 7.0% were infected with intestinal helminths, among which prevalence of hookworm, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and Clonorchis sinensis were 4.3%, 1.9%, 0.5% and 0.3%, respectively; and 0.5% were simultaneously infected with intestinal protozoa and helminths. Among patients with PTB, body mass index (BMI)≤18 (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.44-7.54) and raised poultry or livestock (e.g., chicken, duck, pig) (OR=3.96, 95% CI=1.32-11.89) were significantly associated with harboring intestinal protozoan infection, while BMI≤18 (OR=3.32, 95% CI=1.39-7.91), anemia (OR=3.40, 95% CI=1.44-8.02) and laboring barefoot in farmlands (OR=4.54, 95% CI=1.88-10.92) were significantly associated with having intestinal helminth infection. Additionally, there was no significant relationship between duration of anti-MTB treatment and infection rates of intestinal parasites including protozoa and helminths. Therefore, preventing malnutrition, avoiding unprotected contact with reservoirs of protozoa, and improving health education for good hygiene habits, particularly wearing shoes while outdoors, are beneficial in the prevention of intestinal protozoan and helminth infection among patients with PTB."

            "abstract": "Background: Undernutrition is a significant public health problem and the leading risk factor for India's disease burden. Aim: To understand the determinants of nutritional status among under-five children receiving Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) in India. Methods: The study used the National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) data. The analysis was carried out for under-five children who have availed of any ICDS services in the 12 months preceding the survey (n = 1,27,813). Stunting, wasting, and underweight were estimated following the World Health Organization guideline and used as the outcome variables. The binary logistic regression was conducted to examine the association of ICDS utilization and socioeconomic-demographic predictors with under-five children's nutritional status. STATA (V 13) was used for statistical analyses. Results: A sizable proportion of under-five children receiving any ICDS services suffer from undernutrition. The undernutrition prevalence varied considerably by socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Logistic regression found an insignificant association of ICDS utilization with the nutritional status of under-five children. Children not immunized in ICDS centers were less likely to be stunted (OR: 0.93; P < 0.01), wasted (OR: 0.93; P < 0.01), and underweight (OR: 0.90; P < 0.01) than their counterparts. The child's age and gender, maternal education and nutrition status, wealth index, social group, region, residence, and region were significant determinants of undernutrition among ICDS beneficiaries. Conclusion: The study suggests the need to ensure all available services to children enrolled in the Anganwadi Center (AWC). The program should also emphasize feeding practices and educate parents about improving child health and nutrition."

            "abstract": "Socioeconomic inequality in child malnutrition is well-evident in Bangladesh. However, little is known about whether this inequality differs by regional contexts. We used pooled data from the 2011 and 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey to examine regional differences in socioeconomic inequalities in stunting and underweight among children under five. The analysis included 14,602 children aged 0-59 months. We used logistic regression models and the Concentration index to assess and quantify wealth- and education-related inequalities in child malnutrition. We found stunting and underweight to be more concentrated among children from poorer households and born to less-educated mothers. Although the poverty level was low in the eastern regions, socioeconomic inequalities were greater in these regions compared to the western regions. The extent of socioeconomic inequality was the highest in Sylhet and Chittagong for stunting and underweight, respectively, while it was the lowest in Khulna. Regression results demonstrated the protective effects of socioeconomic status (SES) on child malnutrition. The regional differences in the effects of SES tend to diverge at the lower levels of SES, while they converge or attenuate at the highest levels. Our findings have policy implications for developing programs and interventions targeted to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in child malnutrition in subnational regions of Bangladesh."

This study was conducted to determine 1) the prevalence of anemia in preschool children and 2) risk factors associated with anemia. A total of 138 children aged from 6 to 72 months were recruited through cluster sampling from six villages in Kokang. Hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, blood trace elements, and anthropometric indicators were measured. Feces samples were collected to examine for the presence of ascarid eggs. The overall prevalence of anemia in children was 61.6%, including 10.9% with severe anemia. Meanwhile, high prevalence of stunting (40.0%), underweight (22.4%), wasting (6.3%), and small head circumference (6.7%) was found. Children with anemia were more prone to stunting. Children with severe anemia and moderate anemia had significantly lower blood iron and zinc levels than children without anemia (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007). The prevalence of ascarid infection was 64.9%; however, it was not associated with anemia. Drinking spring water was positively associated with anemia (odds ratio [OR] = 6.368). This study demonstrated that anemia is an important public health problem among children from the Kokang area. Iron deficiency and drinking spring water may be the important causes of anemia among children."

We conducted this study to estimate the prevalence of parasitic infection and nutritional status, and to evaluate the extent to which the two are associated among schoolchildren in rural Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a cross sectional study of 664 students aged from 6 to 19 years old from Angolela, Ethiopia. Socio-demographic information was collected using a structured questionnaire. Anthropometric measurements were taken at the time of interview. Examinations of fecal samples for helminthic and protozoan parasitic infections were performed. Logistic regression procedures were employed to evaluate the association between stunting, underweightedness, and wasting with parasitic infections. RESULTS. One-third of the participants were found to have a protozoan infection, while 7.1% were found to have a helminthic infection. Approximately 11% of the students were stunted, 19.6% were wasted, and 20.8% were underweight. Severely underweight boys were 3.88-times as likely as boys of adequate weight (odds ratio OR = 3.88, 95% confidence interval CI: 1.12-13.52) to be diagnosed with protozoan infections. Among girls, those who were severely stunted were approximately 12 times (OR = 11.84, 95%CI: 1.72-81.62) as likely to be infected with a helminthic parasite, than those who were not. Overall, there was a deficit in normal growth patterns as indicated by lower than average anthropometric measures. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. There is a high prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections. Stunting, wasting, and underweightedness were also prevalent, and showed patterns of associations with intestinal parasitic infections. Efforts should be made to strengthen and expand school and community-based programs that promote inexpensive, though effective, practices to prevent the spread of parasitic diseases. Initiatives aimed at improving the nutritional status of school children are also needed."

Twelve months (Year 1) and 24 months (Year 2) after interventions began, enumerators surveyed mothers to ascertain IYCF practices. We made pairwise comparisons of each intervention arm versus the active control arm using log binomial models. In total, 3,652 caretakers were surveyed at Year 1 and 4,987 caretakers at Year 2. Compared with the active control, there were no differences in any of the arms in MDD, MMF, or MAD, aside from an increase in MDD at Year 1 in the nutrition only arm but not in the combined WSH + N arm (N: 68%; WSH + N: 61%; C: 61%; N arm prevalence ratio: 1.13 95% CI [1.01, 1.25]).

Rotavirus diarrhea incidence rates (episodes per person-year) were 0.13 for infants aged <6 months, 0.61 for those aged 6-11 months, 0.17 for those aged 12-23 months, and 0.15 for those aged 24-35 months. Fifty-six percent of children with rotavirus diarrhea had clinical dehydration; 90% of rotavirus diarrheal episodes occurred between July and November. In infants under 1 year of age, receipt of breast milk was associated with a lower incidence of rotavirus diarrhea. No other sociodemographic or environmental factor was found to be significantly associated with rotavirus diarrhea.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Poor water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in health care facilities increases hospital-associated infections, and the resulting greater use of second-line antibiotics drives antimicrobial resistance. Recognising the existing gaps, the World Health Organisations' Water and Sanitation for Health Facility Improvement Tool (WASH-FIT) was designed for self-assessment. The tool was designed for small primary care facilities mainly providing outpatient and limited inpatient care and was not designed to compare hospital performance. Together with technical experts, we worked to adapt the tool for use in larger facilities with multiple inpatient units (wards), allowing for comparison between facilities and prompt action at different levels of the health system.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We adapted the existing facility improvement tool (WASH-FIT) to create a simple numeric scoring approach. This is to illustrate the variation across hospitals and to facilitate monitoring of progress over time and to group indicators that can be used to identify this variation. Working with stakeholders, we identified those responsible for action to improve WASH at different levels of the health system and used piloting, analysis of interview data to establish the feasibility and potential value of the WASH Facility Survey Tool (WASH-FAST) to demonstrate such variability.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We present an aggregate percentage score based on 65 indicators at the facility level to summarise hospitals' overall WASH status and how this varies. Thirty-four of the 65 indicators spanning four WASH domains can be assessed at ward level enabling within hospital variations to be highlighted. Three levels of responsibility for WASH service monitoring and improvement were identified with stakeholders: the county/regional level, senior hospital management and hospital infection prevention and control committees.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We propose WASH-FAST can be used as a survey tool to assess, measure and monitor the progress of WASH in hospitals in resource-limited settings, providing useful data for decision making and tracking improvements over time."

            "abstract": "A case-control study of children attending a diarrhoea treatment unit (DTU) in Calabar, Nigeria was undertaken to evaluate the association between failure to breastfeed on one hand, and dysentery, persistent diarrhoea and malnutrition on the other. The prevalence of dysentery, persistent diarrhoea and underweight were 6.3%, 1.2% and 36.4% respectively among a total of 1133 children with diarrhoea. The proportion of the children with persistent diarrhoea or underweight was significantly lower among currently breastfeeding children than the age-matched, non-breastfeeding counterparts (p < 0.05). Dysentery was also less frequent among breastfeeding children (5.8%) than the non-breastfeeding ones (7.4%), but this did not reach statistical significance. The findings lend support to the enormous benefit of breastfeeding as a child survival strategy. Global efforts geared towards the support of breastfeeding should be intensified especially the less developed countries where diarrhoea-related morbidity and mortality constitute a major public health problem."

            "abstract": "Undernutrition among children is a major public health concern worldwide, more prevalent in Asia and Africa. It manifests itself in various forms such as wasting or stunting or underweight and retards physical and mental development, increases susceptibility to infection, and reduces educational attainment and productivity. The present study was undertaken to assess the level of wasting, stunting, and underweight and determine its associates among slum children of 3-9 years of age, residing in Bhubaneswar city, India. After obtaining informed consent, a total of 249 children from 249 households were studied and their parents/guardians were interviewed to collect all relevant information. 23.3%, 57.4%, and 45.4% of children were found to have wasting, stunting, and underweight, respectively. Variables like birth order of child, period of initiation of breastfeeding and mother's education were found to be strong predictors of wasting, whereas toilet facility in household and practice of drinking water storage were significantly associated with stunting among slum children as revealed in multiple regression analysis. Thus, a multipronged approach is needed such as giving priority to improve education for slum community especially for women, creating awareness regarding benefits of early initiation of breastfeeding, small family size, and proper storage of drinking water, and providing toilet facility in slum households which could improve the nutritional status of slum children."

            "abstract": "National data for diarrhoeal disease in children can only be used as a very rough guide to morbidity and mortality, since they are based on incomplete reporting. Furthermore, when only one diagnosis per attendance, admission or cause of death is recorded, the true importance of diarrhoea as a cause of morbidity and mortality may be obscured. This may in part explain discrepancies between figures recorded in national and hospital statistics and those recorded in detailed studies of diarrhoeal admissions. While there appear to be quite marked differences in the relative importance of diarrhoea in different parts of the country, and while diarrhoeal disease is less of a scourge than in some other parts of the world, it is nevertheless a major cause of attendance at health facilities, the second or third most common cause of admission to many of the hospitals in the country, and a significant and often preventable cause of death. Limited studies of diarrhoeal aetiology indicate the major importance of rotavirus, Shigella and enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. The control of diarrhoeal diseases in children is based not only on early and appropriate treatment, but also on preventive strategies. These include breastfeeding (which has saved the lives of many thousands of Papua New Guinean children and which is once again under threat), ensuring good host defence by good nutrition, immunization and early treatment of childhood illness, and ensuring satisfactory sanitation and hygiene. Increasing fluid intake to prevent dehydration remains the most important part of the early management of acute diarrhoeal disease. In the management of children with dehydration, UNICEF glucose-based oral rehydration therapy is widely available but not used as well as it should be. There are significant advantages in cereal-based oral rehydration solutions, and the use of such solutions, locally prepared, should be encouraged. Breastfeeding should be continued during episodes of diarrhoea, unless there is the specific contraindication of lactose intolerance. In all events the child's nutritional intake should be maintained and if possible increased during episodes of diarrhoea. There are specific indications for the use of antibiotics in the management of children with diarrhoea. They should not be used, and may be harmful, in the absence of these indications. Persistent diarrhoea--lasting more than 14 days--is associated with a high mortality and severe malnutrition. It is therefore important that children whose diarrhoea is prolonged for more than 7 days are managed appropriately, using the standard guidelines."

Compared to the Chinese references, the subject children were judged to be retarded in growth at the population level. Comparisons among tertiles classified by the extents of change in weight-for-age Z score from the first to the last survey revealed significant effects of dietary intakes and parasite infections. In particular, there were two observations for the high-tertile boys and girls, whose Z scores of height-for-age, weight-for-age and BMI-for-age in higher ages were similar to, or higher than, the Chinese references. First, their energy intakes were larger than those of mid- and low-tertile boys and girls but were only 80-88% of the recommended dietary allowances for Chinese. Second, they were characterized by high prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum at the first survey but nil from the second survey. In conclusion, there is a high possibility that the children, who are recognized as undernourished at the population level, are able to attain the Chinese standards by increase of energy intake to the level of 10% lower than the recommended allowance for Chinese and eradication of S. japonicum."

Preschool-age children are especially vulnerable due to their high growth requirements. To target interventions for preschool-age children in a community of extreme poverty in Peru, we conducted a household survey between October 2005 and January 2006 to determine the prevalence of malnutrition and its risk factors. Of 252 children < 5 years old, the prevalence of wasting, underweight and stunting was 26.6, 28.6 and 32.1 %, respectively, based on the new WHO Child Growth Standards. Risk factors for wasting were: (1) moderate-high intensity Trichuris infection (OR 2.50; 95 % CI 1.06, 5.93); (2) hookworm infection (OR 6.67; 95 % CI 1.08, 41.05); (3) age (OR6-month 1.27; 95 % CI 1.11, 1.46); (4) maternal education (secondary incomplete) (OR 5.77; 95 % CI 2.38, 13.99); and (5) decreasing maternal BMI (OR1 kg/m2 1.12; 95 % CI 1.02, 1.23).

Unsafe disposal of children's stool makes children susceptible to many diseases that transmit through faecal-oral route.

The urban-rural gap in the unsafe disposal of children's stool was wide. Mother's illiteracy and lack of exposure to media, the age of the child, religion and caste/tribe of the household head, wealth index, access to toilet facility and urban-rural residence were statistically associated with unsafe disposal of stool. The odds of diarrhea in children whose stools were disposed of unsafely was estimated to be 11% higher (95% CI: 1.01-1.21) than that of children whose stools were disposed of safely. An increase in the unsafe disposal of children's stool in the community also increased the risk of diarrhea in children.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We found significant statistical association between children's stool disposal and diarrhea.

Nigeria has the second-highest burden of stunting globally and a higher-than-average child wasting prevalence. Moreover, there is substantial spatial variation in the prevalence of stunting and wasting in Nigeria.

Socioeconomic inequalities in stunting and wasting were measured using the concentration curve and Erreygers' corrected concentration index. A pro-poor concentration index is negative, meaning that the poor bear a disproportionately higher burden of stunting or wasting than the wealthy. A positive or pro-rich index is the opposite. Standard methodologies were applied to decompose the concentration index (C) while the Oaxaca-Blinder approach was used to decompose changes in the concentration indices (ΔC).\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The socioeconomic inequalities in child stunting and wasting were pro-poor in 2013 and 2018.

The changes in the socioeconomic inequalities in stunting and wasting varied by geopolitical zones. Significant determinants of these changes for both stunting and wasting were changes in inequalities in wealth, maternal education and religion. Under-five dependency, access to improved toilet facilities and geopolitical zone significantly explained changes in only stunting inequality, while access to improved water facilities only significantly determined the change in inequality in wasting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Addressing the socio-economic, spatial and demographic determinants of the changes in the socioeconomic inequalities in child stunting and wasting, especially wealth, maternal education and access to sanitation is critical for improving child stunting and wasting in Nigeria."

            "abstract": "Child stunting is associated with poor water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), partly due to the effect of infection on intestinal nutrient absorption. WASH interventions, however, show little effect on growth. A hypothesis is that bacterial contamination of hands and floors from domestic animals and their faeces, and subsequent ingestion via infant hand-to-mouth behaviours, may explain this. This formative study used microbial testing and survey and observational data from 20 households in Ethiopia to characterise principle bacterial transmission pathways to infants, considering WASH facilities and practices, infant behaviours and animal exposure. Microbial swabbing showed the contamination of hands and floor surfaces from thermotolerant coliform bacteria. Animal husbandry practices, such as keeping animals inside, contributed significantly (all p < 0.005). There was no evidence that latrine facilities mitigated contamination across infant (p = 0.76) or maternal (p = 0.86) hands or floor surfaces (p = 0.36). This small study contributes to the evidence that animal faeces are an important source of domestic bacterial contamination. The results imply that interventions aiming to reduce pathogen transmission to infants should think beyond improving WASH and also consider the need to separate infants and animals in the home. Intervention studies will be required to determine whether this reduces infant infection and improves linear growth."

            "abstract": "Stunting (length-for-age z score < -2) before 2 years of age has shown associations with poor child developmental indicators, but information at the population level is scarce in South Asia, the region with the highest burden of stunting. We examined associations between z scores (i.e., height for age [HAZ], weight for age [WAZ], and weight for height [WHZ]) and undernutrition (i.e., stunting [HAZ < -2], wasting [WHZ < -2], and underweight [WAZ < -2]) with learning/cognition and social-emotional development among children 36-59 months of age. Data from Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in Bangladesh (n = 8,659), Bhutan (n = 2,038), Nepal (n = 2,253), and Pakistan (Punjab n = 11,369 and Sindh n = 6,718) were used. Children were considered developmentally \"on-track\" in learning/cognition or social-emotional domains if they met specific early child development criteria. Meta-analysis was conducted to examine regional associations, adjusting for socio-economic status, early childhood education, and quality of care. In a pooled sample, on-track learning/cognition development was positively associated with HAZ (OR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.07, 1.27]) and WAZ (OR = 1.18, 95% CI [1.07, 1.31]) and negatively associated with stunting (OR = 0.72, 95% CI [0.60, 0.86]) and underweight (OR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.66, 0.86]) but not associated with WHZ or wasting. On-track development of social-emotional domain was not associated with any z scores or undernutrition indicators. Across several countries of South Asia, stunted children were less likely to be developmentally \"on track\" for learning/cognition. It is likely that interventions that prevent stunting may benefit child development, leading to significant individual and societal gains given the large burden of child stunting in regions like South Asia."

            "abstract": "While preventive chemotherapy remains to be a major strategy for the prevention and control of soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH), improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) comprise the long-term strategy to achieve sustained control of STH. This study examined the parasitological and nutritional status of school-age and preschool-age children in four villages in Southern Leyte, Philippines where two of the villages attained Open-Defecation-Free (ODF) status after introduction of Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS). A total of 341 children (89.0% of the total eligible population) submitted stool samples which were examined using the Kato-Katz technique. Results showed that 27.9% of the total stool samples examined had at least one type of STH (cumulative prevalence), while 7.9% had moderate-heavy intensity infections. Between the two villages where CLTS was introduced, Buenavista had a significantly higher cumulative prevalence of STH at 67.4% (p<0.001) and prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity STH at 23.5% (p=0.000), while Caubang had a significantly lower cumulative prevalence at 4.9% and prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity at 1.8%. On the other hand, the non-CLTS villages of Bitoon and Saub had similar rates for cumulative prevalence (16.7% and 16.8%, respectively; p=0.984) and prevalence of moderate-heavy intensity STH (2.0% and 3.1%, respectively; p=1.000). The findings may be explained by factors that include possible reversion to open defecation, non-utilization of sanitary facilities, and mass drug administration (MDA) coverage, although further studies that can accurately assess the impact of CLTS are recommended. While this study was descriptive, the data indicate no clear pattern among the parasitological and nutritional parameters, as well as the presence of CLTS in the village, suggesting the need to monitor the ODF status of villages on a regular basis even after the end of CLTS activities to ensure the sustainability of the CLTS approach. In order to achieve effective control of STH, deeper collaboration between the WASH and STH sectors are recommended where partners can work together in the area of monitoring and evaluation that may include improved parasitological and nutritional status in high-risk groups, as well as sustainable behavior change as outcome indicators."

Sanitation is one way to reduce the spread of enteric pathogens in the environment; however, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of sanitation in rural LMICs in reducing pathogens in the environment. In this study, we measured the impact of a sanitation intervention (dual-pit latrines, sani-scoops, child potties delivered as part of a randomized control trial, WASH Benefits) in rural Bangladeshi household compounds by assessing prevalence ratios, differences, and changes in the concentration of pathogen genes and host-specific fecal markers. We found no difference in the prevalence of pathogenic Escherichia coli, norovirus, or Giardia genes in the domestic environment in the sanitation and control arms. The prevalence of the human fecal marker was lower on child hands and the concentration of animal fecal marker was lower on mother hands in the sanitation arm in adjusted models, but these associations were not significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. In the subset of households with ≥10 individuals per compound, the prevalence of enterotoxigenic E. coli genes on child hands was lower in the sanitation arm. Incomplete removal of child and animal feces or the compound (versus community-wide) scale of intervention could explain the limited impacts of improved sanitation."

A door-to-door census was undertaken for all households in all communities. Infants aged 1-11 months were weighed for weight-based dosing in the trial and their weights were used to calculate weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ). Underweight was defined as WAZ ≤ 2. We evaluated the age patterns in WAZ and underweight by demographic, seasonal, and geographic characteristics. Of 7,109 infants, 6,077 had accurate weight and global positioning system (GPS) coordinate data (85.5%). Infants were a median of 6 months old (interquartile range [IQR] 3-8) and 48.4% were female.

Any STH presence was significantly associated with father's occupation, father's education level, type of house and the flooring of the house in which students reported to live. No significant associations were observed between water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) variables measured and presence of any STH infection. The prevalence of STH was found to be very low with primarily light intensity in this study. Nonetheless, it was also found that the sanitation situation is not ideal in the country, with several students reporting constant or partial open defecation leading to environmental contamination. Based on this prevalence and in line with the WHO guideline, it is recommended that deworming be reduced to once a year in combination with concerted health education on proper hygiene and sanitation practice."

The aim was to study the growth and nutritional status of children under 5 years of age and the effect of socioeconomic factors on child development. Anthropometric indices (weight-for-age, height-for-age and weight-for-height) differed in the two regions. The prevalence of stunting was significantly higher among children from mainly rural Al Jabel Al Garby (6.1%) than those from urban Tripoli (2.5%). The z-scores that correlated strongly with under-nutrition included: mother's education, child's age and sex, and region. Stunting was significantly related to age and region and to maternal education level and family size. Wasting was highly correlated with maternal education."

Discrete-time logistic models (with community fixed effects) were used to examine mortality and malnutrition outcomes: infant, child, and under-5 mortality; stunting, wasting, and being underweight. Analysis was conducted at the national, urban/rural, and regional levels, separately for boys and girls. The results indicate that the relationship between household wealth and under-5 mortality weakened over time but this result was dominated by infant mortality. The relationship between wealth and child mortality stayed strong for girls. The relationship between household wealth and malnutrition became stronger over time for boys and particularly for girls, in urban and (especially) rural areas."

            "abstract": "The recent research findings concerning syndromes of muscle wasting, malnutrition, and inflammation in individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) have led to a need for new terminology. To address this need, the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) convened an expert panel to review and develop standard terminologies and definitions related to wasting, cachexia, malnutrition, and inflammation in CKD and AKI. The ISRNM expert panel recommends the term 'protein-energy wasting' for loss of body protein mass and fuel reserves. 'Kidney disease wasting' refers to the occurrence of protein-energy wasting in CKD or AKI regardless of the cause. Cachexia is a severe form of protein-energy wasting that occurs infrequently in kidney disease. Protein-energy wasting is diagnosed if three characteristics are present (low serum levels of albumin, transthyretin, or cholesterol), reduced body mass (low or reduced body or fat mass or weight loss with reduced intake of protein and energy), and reduced muscle mass (muscle wasting or sarcopenia, reduced mid-arm muscle circumference). The kidney disease wasting is divided into two main categories of CKD- and AKI-associated protein-energy wasting. Measures of chronic inflammation or other developing tests can be useful clues for the existence of protein-energy wasting but do not define protein-energy wasting. Clinical staging and potential treatment strategies for protein-energy wasting are to be developed in the future."

In this study, we examined the contribution of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium and Giardia found in groundwater sources used for drinking to the total burden of diarrheal disease among children < 5 in rural India.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology/principal findings:\n        \n      \n      We studied a population of 3,385 children < 5 years of age in 100 communities of Puri District, Odisha, India. We developed a coupled quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) population model based on observed levels of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in improved groundwater sources used for drinking and compared the QMRA-SIR estimates with independently measured all-cause (i.e., all fecal-oral enteric pathogens and exposure pathways) child diarrhea prevalence rates observed in the study population during two monsoon seasons (2012 and 2013). We used site specific and regional studies to inform assumptions about the human pathogenicity of the Cryptosporidium and Giardia species present in local groundwater. In all three human pathogenicity scenarios evaluated, the mean daily risk of Cryptosporidium or Giardia infection (0.06-1.53%), far exceeded the tolerable daily risk of infection from drinking water in the US (< 0.0001%). Depending on which protozoa species were present, median estimates of daily child diarrhea prevalence due to either Cryptosporidium or Giardia infection from drinking water was as high as 6.5% or as low as < 1% and accounted for at least 2.9% and as much as 65.8% of the all-cause diarrhea disease burden measured in children < 5 during the study period. Cryptosporidium tended to account for a greater share of estimated waterborne protozoa infections causing diarrhea than did Giardia. Diarrhea prevalence estimates for waterborne Cryptosporidium infection appeared to be most sensitive to assumptions about the probability of infection from ingesting a single parasite (i.e. the rate parameter in dose-response model), while Giardia infection was most sensitive to assumptions about the viability of parasites detected in groundwater samples.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions/significance:\n        \n      \n      Protozoa in groundwater drinking sources in rural India, even at low concentrations, especially for Cryptosporidium, may account for a significant portion of child diarrhea morbidity in settings were tubewells are used for drinking water and should be more systematically monitored.

Despite substantial reduction over the last decade and a half, child undernutrition is still high; with 48 percent of children either stunted, underweight or wasted, undernutrition remains an important child health challenge. The existing literature highlights that targeting of efforts to reduce undernutrition in Ethiopia is inefficient, in part due to lack of data and updated information. This paper remedies some of this shortfall by estimating levels of stunting and underweight in each woreda for 2014. The estimates are small area estimations based on the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey and the latest population census. It is shown that small area estimations are powerful predictors of undernutrition, even compared to household characteristics, such as wealth and education, and hence a valuable targeting metric. The results show large variations in share of children undernourished within each region, more than between regions. The results also show that the locations with larger challenges depend on the chosen undernutrition statistic, as the share, number and concentration of undernourished children point to vastly different locations. There is also limited correlation between share of children underweight and stunted across woredas, indicating that different locations face different challenges."

To achieve this, we systematically searched and evaluated existing nutrition interventions carried out in conflict settings that assessed their impact on children's nutrition status. To evaluate the impact of nutrition interventions on children's nutrition and growth status, we identified published literature through EMBASE, PubMed, and Global Health by using a combination of relevant text words and Medical Subject Heading terms. Studies for this review must have included children (aged ≤18 y), been conducted in conflict or postconflict settings, and assessed a nutrition intervention that measured ≥1 outcome for nutrition status (i.e., stunting, wasting, or underweight). Eleven studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this review. Five different nutrition interventions were identified and showed modest results in decreasing the prevalence of stunting, wasting, underweight, reduction in severe or moderate acute malnutrition or both, mortality, anemia, and diarrhea. Overall, nutrition interventions in conflict settings were associated with improved children's nutrition or growth status. Emergency nutrition programs should continue to follow recent recommendations to expand coverage and access (beyond refugee camps to rural areas) and ensure that aid and nutrition interventions are distributed equitably in all conflict-affected populations."

We found that the intervention reduced fly counts at latrine entrances by 69% (aRR = 0.31, [0.13, 0.75]) but not at food preparation areas (aRR = 0.92, [0.33, 2.6]).

            "abstract": "Wasting in children under-five is a form of acute malnutrition, a predictor of under-five child mortality and of increased risk of future episodes of stunting and/or wasting. In India, national estimates of wasting are high compared to international standards with one in five children found to be wasted. National surveys are complex logistical operations and most often not planned or implemented in a manner to control for seasonality. Collection of survey data across differing months across states introduces seasonal bias. Cross-sectional surveys are not designed to collect data on seasonality, thus special methods are needed to analyse the effect of data collection by month. We developed regression models to estimate the mean weight for height (WHZ), prevalence of wasting for every month of the year for an average year and an overall weighted survey estimates controlling for the socio-demographic variation of data collection across states and populations over time. National level analyses show the mean WHZ starts at its highest in January, falls to the lowest in June/August and returns towards peak at year end. The prevalence of wasting is lowest in January and doubles by June/August. After accounting for seasonal patterns in data collection across surveys, the trends are significantly different and indicate a stagnant period followed by a decline in wasting. To avoid biased estimates, direct comparisons of acute malnutrition across surveys should not be made unless seasonality bias is appropriately addressed in planning, implementation or analysis. Eliminating the seasonal variation in wasting would reduce the prevalence by half and provide guidance towards further reduction in acute malnutrition."

Because the risk of PEM is related to the degree of illness, the causal connections between malnutrition and a poorer prognosis are complex. It cannot automatically be inferred that nutritional support will improve the clinical course of patients with wasting disorders. We reviewed studies of the treatment of PEM in cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, stroke, dementia, rehabilitation after hip fracture, chronic renal failure, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple disorders in the elderly. Several methodologic problems are associated with nutrition treatment studies in chronically ill patients. These problems include no generally accepted definition of PEM, uncertain patient compliance with supplementation, and a wide range of outcome variables. Avail-able treatment studies indicate that dietary supplements, either alone or in combination with hormonal treatment, may have positive effects when given to patients with manifest PEM or to patients at risk of developing PEM. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nutritional treatment may improve respiratory function. Nutritional therapy of elderly women after hip fractures may speed up the rehabilitation process. When administered to elderly patients with multiple disorders, diet therapy may improve functional capacity. The data regarding nutritional treatment of the conditions mentioned above is still inconclusive. There is still a great need for randomized controlled long-term studies of the effects of defined nutritional intervention programs in chronically ill and frail elderly with a focus on determining clinically relevant outcomes."

Previous studies have shown that diarrheal diseases during early life are associated with subsequent malnutrition. This prospective cohort study of 576 children under 5 years was conducted in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh, to investigate the association between diarrhea prevalence, child growth, and child cognitive developmental outcomes. Height and weight were measured at baseline and a 12-month follow-up. Diarrhea prevalence was assessed through monthly surveillance visits. Developmental outcomes were assessed by communication, fine motor, gross motor, personal social, problem-solving, and combined developmental scores measured by the Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (EASQ) at the 12-month follow-up visit. To assess the association between diarrhea prevalence, child growth, and child cognitive developmental outcomes, linear regression models were fit using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering at the household level and to approximate 95% CIs. Diarrhea prevalence was negatively associated with change in height-for-age (HAZ) Z-scores from baseline to the 12-month follow-up (coefficient -0.85 [95% CI: -1.42, -0.28]). Diarrhea prevalence was a significant predictor of combined EASQ Z-scores with and without baseline stunting included in the model (-0.89 [95% CI: -1.67, -0.09] [baseline stunting included]) and (-0.88 [95% CI: -1.69, -0.07]). Change in HAZ from baseline to the 12-month follow-up was positively associated with follow-up combined EASQ Z-scores (0.28 [95% CI: 0.15, 0.42]). High diarrhea prevalence and linear growth faltering were associated with negative cognitive developmental outcomes among children residing in urban Dhaka, Bangladesh. Furthermore, high diarrhea prevalence was associated with negative child cognitive developmental outcomes with stunting included in the model, suggesting an effect of diarrhea on cognition independent of stunting."

Nested within a birth cohort study, this study investigates relationships among water quality, EED, and growth in 385 children living in southwestern Uganda. Water quality was assessed using a portable water quality test when children were 6 months, and safe water was defined as lacking Escherichia coli contamination. Environmental enteric dysfunction was assessed using the lactulose:mannitol (L:M) test at 12-16 months. Anthropometry and covariate data were extracted from the cohort study, and associations were assessed using linear and logistic regression models. Less than half of the households (43.8%) had safe water, and safe versus unsafe water did not correlate with improved versus unimproved water source. In adjusted linear regression models, children from households with safe water had significantly lower log-transformed (ln) L:M ratios (β: -0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.44, -0.00) and significantly higher length-for-age (β: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.58) and weight-for-age (β: 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.34) Z-scores at 12-16 months.

Food insecurity and associated undernutrition detrimentally affect health and socioeconomic development in the short and long term, for individuals, including children, and societies. Physical and economic access to food is crucial to ensure food security. Community-level interventions could be important to increase access to food in LMICs.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the effects of community-level interventions that aim to improve access to nutritious food in LMICs, for both the whole community and for disadvantaged or at-risk individuals or groups within a community, such as infants, children and women; elderly, poor or unemployed people; or minority groups.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched for relevant studies in 16 electronic databases, including trial registries, from 1980 to September 2019, and updated the searches in six key databases in February 2020.

All population groups, adults and children, living in communities in LMICs exposed to community-level interventions aiming to improve food access were eligible for inclusion. We excluded studies that only included participants with specific diseases or conditions (e.g. severely malnourished children). Eligible interventions were broadly categorised into those that improved buying power (e.g. create income-generation opportunities, cash transfer schemes); addressed food prices (e.g. vouchers and subsidies); addressed infrastructure and transport that affected physical access to food outlets; addressed the social environment and provided social support (e.g. social support from family, neighbours or government).\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full texts of potentially eligible records, against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or arbitration by a third author, if necessary. For each included study, two authors independently extracted data and a third author arbitrated disagreements. However, the outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by a biostatistician. We assessed risk of bias for all studies using the Effective Practice and Organization of Care (EPOC) risk of bias tool for studies with a separate control group. We conducted meta-analyses if there was a minimum of two studies for interventions within the same category, reporting the same outcome measure and these were sufficiently homogeneous. Where we were able to meta-analyse, we used the random-effects model to incorporate any existing heterogeneity. Where we were unable to conduct meta-analyses, we synthesised using vote counting based on effect direction.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 59 studies, including 214 to 169,485 participants, and 300 to 124, 644 households, mostly from Africa and Latin America, addressing the following six intervention types (three studies assessed two different types of interventions). Interventions that improved buying power: Unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) (16 cRCTs, two RCTs, three PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that UCTs improve food security and make little or no difference to cognitive function and development and low-certainty evidence that UCTs may increase dietary diversity and may reduce stunting. The evidence was very uncertain about the effects of UCTs on the proportion of household expenditure on food, and on wasting. Regarding adverse outcomes, evidence from one trial indicates that UCTs reduce the proportion of infants who are overweight. Conditional cash transfers (CCTs) (nine cRCTs, five PCSs): we found high-certainty evidence that CCTs result in little to no difference in the proportion of household expenditure on food and that they slightly improve cognitive function in children; moderate-certainty evidence that CCTs probably slightly improve dietary diversity and low-certainty evidence that they may make little to no difference to stunting or wasting. Evidence on adverse outcomes (two PCSs) shows that CCTs make no difference to the proportion of overweight children. Income generation interventions (six cRCTs, 11 PCSs): we found moderate-certainty evidence that income generation interventions probably make little or no difference to stunting or wasting; and low-certainty evidence that they may result in little to no difference to food security or that they may improve dietary diversity in children, but not for households. Interventions that addressed food prices: Food vouchers (three cRCTs, one RCT): we found moderate-certainty evidence that food vouchers probably reduce stunting; and low-certainty evidence that that they may improve dietary diversity slightly, and may result in little to no difference in wasting. Food and nutrition subsidies (one cRCT, three PCSs): we found low-certainty evidence that food and nutrition subsidies may improve dietary diversity among school children. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects on household expenditure on healthy foods as a proportion of total expenditure on food (very low-certainty evidence). Interventions that addressed the social environment: Social support interventions (one cRCT, one PCS): we found moderate-certainty evidence that community grants probably make little or no difference to wasting; low-certainty evidence that they may make little or no difference to stunting. The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of village savings and loans on food security and dietary diversity. None of the included studies addressed the intervention category of infrastructure changes. In addition, none of the studies reported on one of the primary outcomes of this review, namely prevalence of undernourishment.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The body of evidence indicates that UCTs can improve food security. Income generation interventions do not seem to make a difference for food security, but the evidence is unclear for the other interventions. CCTs, UCTs, interventions that help generate income, interventions that help minimise impact of food prices through food vouchers and subsidies can potentially improve dietary diversity. UCTs and food vouchers may have a potential impact on reducing stunting, but CCTs, income generation interventions or social environment interventions do not seem to make a difference on wasting or stunting. CCTs seem to positively impact cognitive function and development, but not UCTs, which may be due to school attendance, healthcare visits and other conditionalities associated with CCTs."

In the present paper we examine--through one pilot and one final trial--whether prevention of these two syndromes can be achieved in the field by immunomodulation of the pig e.g., by improving its non-specific immunological response. In both trials two groups of early weaned piglets were submitted to the treatments. In the pilot trial the first group received no treatment and served as controls and the animals of the second group were injected twice with an inactivated Parapoxvirus based immunomodulator (Baypamun, Bayer, Germany). In the final trial the first group of piglets received no treatment and served as a control group. The animals of the second group were injected twice with a freeze-dried immunomodulator (Baypamun). Piglets were compared with regard to the severity of PWS, mortality, growth performance parameters, and for the presence of pathogens in their faeces. The results have shown that Baypamun treated piglets performed significantly better than negative control piglets in all the parameters examined.

No S. mekongi infection was detected, although a high level of intense human water contacts was reported. Helminth infection such as Ascaris lumbricoides (27.7%) and hookworms (29.7%) were common. Trichuris trichiura 4.4%), Hymenolepis nana (6.2%), Giardia lamblia (4.2%), and Entamoeba spp (14.4%) were also recorded. Strongyloides stercoralis was frequently diagnosed (20.2%). It was concluded that it is unlikely that S. mekongi is transmitted in Tonle Sap Lake. However, other intestinal parasitic infections are widespread. In particular, S. stercoralis should be considered an important etiologic agent in children and adolescents with abdominal complaints."

We undertook 4 phases of formative research, comprising in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, behavior trials, and a combination of observations and microbiological sampling methods. The resulting WASH intervention comprises material inputs and behavior change communication to promote stool disposal, handwashing with soap, water treatment, protected exploratory play, and hygienic infant feeding. Nurture and disgust were found to be key motivators, and are used as emotional triggers. The concept of a safe play space for young children was particularly novel, and families were eager to implement this after learning about the risks of unprotected exploratory play. An iterative process of formative research was essential to create a sequenced and integrated longitudinal intervention for a SHINE household as it expects (during pregnancy) and then cares for a new child."

We thus go on to explore describe the common clinical 'syndromes' of child undernutrition: wasting, stunting and failure to thrive (weight faltering) and how we have used data from two population-based cohort studies, this paper to explore how much these different 'syndromes' overlap and the extent to which they reflect true undernutrition. This analysis revealed that when more than one definition is applied to the same children, a majority are below the lower threshold for only one measure. However, those with both weight faltering and low BMI in infancy, go on in later childhood to show growth and body composition patterns suggestive of previous undernutrition. In older children there is even less overlap and most children with either wasting or low fat seem to be simply growing at one extreme of the normal range. We conclude that in affluent societies the diagnosis of undernutrition is only robust when it relies on a combination of both, that is decline in weight or BMI centile and wasting."

The aetiology of stunting is complex and still largely unknown. Helminths can cause significant mortality and morbidity and have often been cited as major causative agents for stunting, although their actual role in childhood stunting remains unclear. Our aim was to systematically review the current evidence to help support or refute the hypothesis that helminths cause physical stunting in children.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Inclusion criteria were as follows: infected with (and/or exposed to) helminths (soil-transmitted helminths, schistosomes or food-borne trematodes), children, pregnant or breastfeeding women as study participants (children included infants 0-1 year old, preschool-age children 1-5 years and school-age children > 5 years old), anthelmintic treatment intervention, stunting-related variables reported (e.g. height, height-for-age z-score, birth weight), helminth infection reported in relation to stunting, any geographic location, any date, peer-reviewed literature only. Exclusion criteria were: non-primary research, study protocols, studies with no new data, non-English language papers and animal (non-human) helminth studies. Seven databases were searched on 28 May 2021.

            "abstract": "In 2017, an estimated 1 in every 4 (23%) children aged < 5 years were stunted worldwide. With slow progress in stunting reduction in many regions and the realization that a large proportion of stunting is not due to insufficient diet or diarrhea alone, it remains that other factors must explain continued growth faltering. Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), a subclinical state of intestinal inflammation, can occur in infants across the developing world and is proposed as an immediate causal factor connecting poor sanitation and stunting. A result of chronic pathogen exposure, EED presents multiple causal pathways, and as such the scope and sensitivity of traditional water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions have possibly been unsubstantial. Although the definite pathogenesis of EED and the mechanism by which stunting occurs are yet to be defined, this paper reviews the existing literature surrounding the proposed pathology and transmission of EED in infants and considerations for nutrition and WASH interventions to improve linear growth worldwide."

This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 among a representative sample of under-five children. A total of 350 children and their proxy were selected from all Gaza strip governorates, using a cluster random sampling method. The Radimer/Cornell food-security scale was used. A 24-h dietary recall was employed for dietary intakes assessment. Nutrition-related KAP for feeding under-five children, anthropometric measurements, and demographic-socioeconomic characteristics were obtained with an interview-based questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. The children from food-insecure households had a high prevalence of moderate underweight (30.4%), stunting (32.8%), wasting (9.6%), and acute undernutrition (30.4%). Between food-insecure and food-secure groups there were significant differences in weight, height/length, mid-upper arm circumference, weight-for-age and mid-upper arm circumference z-scores, underweight, acute undernutrition, intakes of protein, fat, vitamin D, zinc, continued breastfeeding, having nutrition-related adequate knowledge, having nutrition-related positive attitudes, and achieved minimum dietary diversity score (P < 0.05 for all). Additionally, about (56.0%) food-insecure households have inadequate nutrition-related knowledge, (77.6%) have nutrition-related negative attitudes, and (95.2%) did not achieve a minimum dietary diversity score. In conclusion, the children from food-insecure households had a high prevalence of moderate underweight, stunting, wasting, and acute undernutrition. Moreover, low economic status, poor dietary intakes, low levels of nutrition-related KAP, and lack of dietary diversity could contribute to the high levels of food insecurity among under-five children."

Normal growth is dependent on adequate nutrition and encompasses major transformations from birth to adulthood. Nutrition is a focal point for health and well being; and has special significance in countries with disadvantages in socioeconomic and hygienic standards. Objective The objective of the present study was to assess the nutritional status in terms of prevalence of underweight, stunting and thinness among rural school going children. Method The present study was cross-sectional study, conducted on 438 rural school going children (169 male and 259 female) with the age group 4-16 years, during the period from April 2014 to July 2014. Age was recorded in year; height and weight were measured in centimeter and kilogram respectively. BMI was calculated by using standard equation. Result The present study concluded that the nutritional status in terms of prevalence of underweight, stunting and thinness were found to be 30.85%, 24.54% and 10.05% respectively among rural school going children of Kavre district. It was revealed that 37.87% was underweight, 29.59% was stunted and 11.25% was thinness among male children whereas in female children, 26.27% was underweight, 21.24% was stunted and 9.27% was thinness. Hence, high prevalence of underweight, stunting and thinness were observed in male than in female children. Conclusion The present study has successfully documented the nutritional status in terms of prevalence of underweight, stunting and thinness among the rural school going children of Kavre district.

Despite billions of dollars and decades of effort, we still lack a sound understanding of which kinds of WASH interventions are most effective in improving public health outcomes, and an important corollary-whether the right things are being measured. The World Health Organization (WHO) has made a concerted effort to compile comprehensive data on drinking water quality and sanitation in the developing world. A recent 2014 report provides information on three phenotypes (responses): Unsafe Water Deaths, Unsafe Sanitation Deaths, Unsafe Hygiene Deaths; two grouped phenotypes: Unsafe Water and Sanitation Deaths and Unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Deaths; and six explanatory variables (predictors): Improved Sanitation, Unimproved Water Source, Piped Water To Premises, Other Improved Water Source, Filtered and Bottled Water in the Household and Handwashing.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and findings:\n        \n      \n      Regression analyses were performed to identify statistically significant associations between these mortality responses and predictors. Good fitted-model performance required: (1) the use of population-normalized death fractions as opposed to number of deaths; (2) transformed response (logit or power); and (3) square-root predictor transformation. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the relationships and countries being studied, these models exhibited remarkable performance and explained, for example, about 85% of the observed variance in population-normalized Unsafe Sanitation Death fraction, with a high F-statistic and highly statistically significant predictor p-values. Similar performance was found for all other responses, which was an unexpected result (the expected associations between responses and predictors-i.e., water-related with water-related, etc. did not occur). The set of statistically significant predictors remains the same across all responses. That is, Unsafe Water Source (UWS), Improved Sanitation (IS) and Filtered and Bottled Water in the Household (FBH) were the only statistically significant predictors whether the response was Unsafe Sanitation Death Fraction, Unsafe Hygiene Death Fraction or Unsafe Water Death Fraction. Moreover, the fraction of variance explained for all fitted models remained relatively high (adjusted R2 ranges from 0.7605 to 0.8533). We find that two of the statistically significant predictors-Improved Sanitation and Unimproved Water Sources-are particularly influential. We also find that some predictors (Piped Water to Premises, Other Improved Water Sources) have very little explanatory power for predicting mortality and one (Other Improved Water Sources) has a counterintuitive effect on response (Unsafe Sanitary Death Fraction increases with increases in OIWS) and one predictor (Hand Washing) to have essentially no explanatory usefulness.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results suggest that a higher priority may need to be given to improved sanitation than has been the case. Nevertheless, while our focus in this paper is mortality, morbidity is a staggering consequence of inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene, and lower impact on mortality may not mean a similarly low impact on morbidity. More specifically, those predictors that we found uninfluential for predicting mortality-related responses may indeed be important when morbidity is the response."

            "abstract": "Breastfeeding has an important role in the prevention of different forms of childhood malnutrition, including wasting, stunting, over- and underweight and micronutrient deficiencies. This chapter reviews research that demonstrates how improved breastfeeding rates have the potential to improve childhood nutrition, with associated impacts on infectious and noninfectious disease prevention. The unique composition of breastmilk, the importance of breastfeeding in infectious disease prevention, the iron status of breastfed infants, and breastfeeding's protective effect on overweight and obesity are discussed based on currently available research. Early and tailored dietary counseling is needed to improve maternal diets, which can affect the nutritional status of breastmilk. Promotion and support of breastfeeding are important to prevent childhood morbidity and mortality. A review of the literature reveals key factors shown to be effective in improving breastfeeding rates, especially including legislation to control the marketing of breastmilk substitutes. In conclusion, breastfeeding is shown to be the best natural resource to improve childhood nutrition throughout the world."

            "abstract": "The World Health Organisation has called for global action to reduce child stunting by 40% by 2025. One third of the world's stunted children live in India, and children belonging to rural indigenous communities are the worst affected. We sought to identify the strongest determinants of stunting among indigenous children in rural Jharkhand and Odisha, India, to highlight key areas for intervention. We analysed data from 1227 children aged 6-23.99 months and their mothers, collected in 2010 from 18 clusters of villages with a high proportion of people from indigenous groups in three districts. We measured height and weight of mothers and children, and captured data on various basic, underlying and immediate determinants of undernutrition. We used Generalised Estimating Equations to identify individual determinants associated with children's height-for-age z-score (HAZ; p < 0.10); we included these in a multivariable model to identify the strongest HAZ determinants using backwards stepwise methods. In the adjusted model, the strongest protective factors for linear growth included cooking outdoors rather than indoors (HAZ +0.66), birth spacing ≥24 months (HAZ +0.40), and handwashing with a cleansing agent (HAZ +0.32). The strongest risk factors were later birth order (HAZ -0.38) and repeated diarrhoeal infection (HAZ -0.23). Our results suggest multiple risk factors for linear growth faltering in indigenous communities in Jharkhand and Odisha. Interventions that could improve children's growth include reducing exposure to indoor air pollution, increasing access to family planning, reducing diarrhoeal infections, improving handwashing practices, increasing access to income and strengthening health and sanitation infrastructure."

Since there is a paucity of information on the prevalence and associated factors of this problem among primary school children in Dessie City in Ethiopia, this study was designed to address these gaps.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 407 stratified-sampled primary school children in five primary schools at Dessie City from April to June 2018. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire, an observation checklist and laboratory analysis of stool samples. Stool specimen from each study participant was collected using clean, properly labeled and leak-proof stool cup. A portion of stool from each study participant collected sample was processed using saline wet mount technique and examined by microscope. The remaining specimens were preserved with 10% formalin and transported to Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital laboratory to be processed by using formol-ether concentration technique. Then, slide smears were prepared from each processed stool specimen and finally, it was microscopically examined with 10x as well as 40x objectives for the presence or absence of intestinal parasites. Factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitosis were determined using binary logistic regression model at 95% CI (confidence interval). Thus, bivariate (COR [crude odds ratio]) and multivariable (AOR [adjusted odds ratio]) logistic regression analyses were carried out. From the multivariable analysis, variables having a p-value of less than 0.05 were declared as factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitosis among primary school children.\n    \n\n\n          Main findings:\n        \n      \n      The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was found to be 16.0% (95% CI: 12.5-19.4%), of these, 50.8% were positive for protozoa, 32.2% for helminth infections and 16.9% for double co-infections. Entamoeba histolytica was the most prevalent parasite (29.2%), followed by Giardia lamblia (21.5%), Ascaris lumbricoides (18.5%), Hymenolepis nana (9.2%) and Enterobius vermicularis (4.6%). Prevalence rates were similar among government (16.3%) and private (15.7%) school children. Water consumption was less than 5 liters per capita per day in 4 of the 5 schools. Thirty-eight (9.3%) of primary school students reported that they practiced open defecation. About two-thirds (285, 70.0%) said they always washed their hands after defecation. Mother's education (illiterate) (AOR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.20-9.37), father's education (illiterate) (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.40-10.82), fathers who could read and write (AOR = 3.3; 95% CI: 1.25-7.86), handwashing before meal (sometimes) (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.11-4.17) and poor knowledge of WASH (AOR = 9.3; 95% CI: 2.17-16.70) were statistically associated with presence of intestinal parasitic infections.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      We concluded that the prevalence of intestinal parasitosis in the study area among Grades 4-8 primary school children had public health significance. Factors significantly associated with intestinal parasitosis among primary school children's were illiterate mothers and fathers, irregular handwashing of children before meals, and poor knowledge of WASH. Health education to improve students' WASH knowledge and mass deworming for parasites are recommended as preventive measures; and improvements to the quality of WASH facilities in primary schools are strongly recommended to support these measures."

During 1992-2016, the prevalence of underweight among children had declined from 53% to 36%, stunting had declined from 52% to 38% while that of wasting had increased from 17% to 21% in India. The national average in the level of malnutrition conceals large variation across districts of India. Using data from the recent round of National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16 this paper examined the spatial heterogeneity and meso-scale correlates of child malnutrition across 640 districts of India.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Moran's I statistics and bivariate LISA maps were used to understand spatial dependence and clustering of child malnutrition. Multiple regression, spatial lag and error models were used to examine the correlates of malnutrition. Poverty, body mass index (BMI) of mother, breastfeeding practices, full immunization, institutional births, improved sanitation and electrification in the household were used as meso scale correlates of malnutrition.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The univariate Moran's I statistics was 0.65, 0.51 and 0.74 for stunting, wasting and underweight respectively suggesting spatial heterogeneity of malnutrition in India.

The pattern was similar with respect to wasting and underweight suggesting spatial clustering of malnutrition against the meso scale correlates in the geographical hotspots of India. Results of spatial error model suggested that the coefficient of BMI of mother and poverty of household were strong and significant predictors of stunting, wasting and underweight. The coefficient of BMI in spatial error model was largest found for underweight (β = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.29-0.48) followed by stunting (β = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.14-0.33) and wasting (β = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01-0.22).

This study was aimed at identifying the prevalence of malnutrition among 256 children of rural areas of Karnataka in South India, who attended the aanganwadis. The value of using various field-based formulae and of various anthropometric indicators used for classification of malnutrition was also studied. The children, aged 12-60 months, came from villages located at the outskirts of Bangalore city. The prevalence of wasting, stunting, and wasting and stunting was 31.2%, 9.4%, and 29.2% respectively. Wasting was more predominant among the younger age groups (p<0.01). To detect wasting (acute malnutrition), the best indicator was a comparison with the reference weight calculated using Weech's formula. However, the age of child had to be rounded off to the nearest quarter of a year. Results of the study showed that indicators, such as mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), needed to be used with caution since they are not sensitive enough to detect all cases of malnutrition. However, the MUAC-for-height (quac stick) method could be used since it was more sensitive. For detection of stunting, if reference tables are not available, Weech's formula can be used for calculation of expected height taking care to account for age to the nearest quarter, although the sensitivity of this indicator is not very high."

When episodes are prolonged or frequent, acute malnutrition is also associated with poor growth and development, which contributes to stunting Nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive strategies to prevent undernutrition during the first 1,000 days from conception to 24 months of age can reduce the risks of wasting, stunting, and micronutrient deficiencies. Under circumstances that exacerbate the underlying causes of undernutrition and increase the incidence of wasting, such as food insecurity related to lean seasons or emergencies, or increased incidence of illness, such as diarrhea or measles, additional efforts are required to prevent and treat wasting. Special nutritious foods directly meet the increased nutrient requirements of children at risk for wasting; assistance to vulnerable households, in the form of cash or food, enables households to better meet the food, health, and other needs of household members and may increase resilience; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and health interventions help prevent and address illness and hence reduce wasting risk. The contributions of specific interventions to reducing the incidence of wasting are difficult to assess under emergency conditions, due to ethical constraints and to the fact that multiple strategies are implemented at the same time. However, pragmatic studies under real-life circumstances, using different designs, e.g., including a group receiving \"best possible\" treatment, can provide evidence about what works, to what extent, at what cost, and under which circumstances.

Stool samples of children aged 2-14 years and their mothers were analyzed through direct smear analysis, Kato-Katz, spontaneous sedimentation in tube, Baermann's method, and agar plate culture. A questionnaire was administered to collect epidemiological information of interest. Among 124 children, 25.8% had one or more STH. Individual prevalence rates were as follows: Ascaris lumbricoides, 16.1%; Strongyloides stercoralis, 10.5%; hookworm, 1.6%; and Trichuris trichiura, (1.6%). The prevalence of common STH (A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm) was higher among children aged 2-5 years than older children (31.6% versus 12.8%; P = 0.01). In terms of sanitation deficits, walking barefoot was significantly associated with STH infection (OR = 3.28; CI 95% = 1.11-12.07). Furthermore, STH-infected children more frequently had a mother who was concomitantly infected by STH than the non-STH-infected counterpart (36.4% versus 14.1%, P = 0.02). In conclusion, STH infection is highly prevalent in children from this Amazonian community despite routine deworming. Institutional health policies may include hygiene and sanitation improvements and screening/deworming of mothers to limit the dissemination of STH. Further studies are needed to address the social and epidemiological mechanics perpetuating these infections."

Similarly, children aged 0 to 23 months who were not breastfed within the first hour post-partum, those who were provided prelacteal feeds, and those aged 0 to 5 months who were not exclusively breastfed, were more likely to be wasted (P < 0.05 for all three feeding practices). In India, not achieving minimum diet diversity and minimum adequate diet were significantly associated with the co-occurrence of stunting and wasting. In other words, many key domains of concern to development agents who seek to address stunting are also of direct concern to those focused on wasting. The co-occurrence of wasting and stunting requires more integrated interventions. That is, programmes aimed at preventing LBW and poor IYCF to avert stunting should be linked more effectively with actions aimed at the management of wasting."

            "abstract": "Background: At present, whether to use the World Health Organization's (WHO) growth standards or native growth standards to assess the nutritional status in a given population is unclear. This study aimed to compare the differences between the WHO's growth standards and China's growth standards in assessing the nutritional status of children aged 0~36 months. Methods: We used z-scores to evaluate the nutritional status of children. The weight-for-age z-scores (WAZs), length/height-for-age z-scores (LAZ/HAZs), and weight-for-length/height z-scores (WLZ/WHZs) were calculated using the WHO's growth standards and China's growth standards. MeNemar's test was used to compare the nutritional status of children. Results: The results in this study showed that there were differences between the WHO's standards and China's standards in assessing children's nutritional status except for stunting and obesity. The prevalence of underweight assessed using China's standards was higher than when using the WHO's standards (except when 3 and 36 months old). The prevalence of wasting was significantly higher when assessed using China's standards than when using the WHO's standards from 12 to 36 months. The prevalence of overweight was higher when assessed using the WHO's standards from 3 to 8 months. Conclusions: Both the WHO's and China's growth standards are useful measures in assessing children's nutritional status but with key significant differences. Therefore, caution should be taken in selecting appropriate measures in a given population."

In 2017, mortality in the wealthiest region was 12.6‰, whereas the most disadvantaged region it was three times as high, at 36‰.

The direct effect of SES on U5MR is at 2.16 through the underweight pathway, which is 5 times higher than the effect of underweight on U5MR. Through the stunting channel, this direct impact is 1.43, nearly twice as high as the impact of the stunting rate. SES also has an indirect effect on U5MR through these undernutrition pathways. In total, we estimate that an increase in SES index will make the U5MR increase by 2.73‰. Among the three indicators of SES, poverty conveys the strongest signal of a considerable change in SES, thus to a subsequent change in U5MR. Among two types of undernutrition, the effect of stunting on U5MR is dominant, more than 3 times as high as that of underweight.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings have important implications for socio-economic and health interventions: those that strongly focus on the reduction of regional poverty and stunting rates would be effective in bridging the regional gap in the U5MR in Vietnam."

Arriving at the inception of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, and the bold new target of safely managed water, sanitation and hygiene for all by 2030, these results warrant the attention of researchers, policy-makers and practitioners.\n    \n\n\n          Main body:\n        \n      \n      Here we report the conclusions of an expert meeting convened by the World Health Organization and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to discuss these findings, and present five key consensus messages as a basis for wider discussion and debate in the WASH and nutrition sectors. We judge these trials to have high internal validity, constituting good evidence that these specific interventions had no effect on childhood linear growth, and mixed effects on childhood diarrhea. These results suggest that, in settings such as these, more comprehensive or ambitious WASH interventions may be needed to achieve a major impact on child health.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These results are important because such basic interventions are often deployed in low-income rural settings with the expectation of improving child health, although this is rarely the sole justification. Our view is that these three new trials do not show that WASH in general cannot influence child linear growth, but they do demonstrate that these specific interventions had no influence in settings where stunting remains an important public health challenge. We support a call for transformative WASH, in so much as it encapsulates the guiding principle that - in any context - a comprehensive package of WASH interventions is needed that is tailored to address the local exposure landscape and enteric disease burden."

To alleviate this problem, we adopted a multifaceted single index known as the composite index for anthropometric failure (CIAF). Using this undernutrition index, we investigated the disparities of Ethiopian under-five children's undernutrition status in space and time.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data for analysis were extracted from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHSs). The space-time dynamics models were formulated to explore the effects of different covariates on undernutrition among children under five in 72 administrative zones in Ethiopia.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The general nested spatial-temporal dynamic model with spatial and temporal lags autoregressive components was found to be the most adequate (AIC = -409.33, R2 = 96.01) model. According to the model results, the increase in the percentage of breastfeeding mothers in the zone decreases the CIAF rates of children in the zone. Similarly, the increase in the percentages of parental education, and mothers' nutritional status in the zones decreases the CIAF rate in the zone. On the hand, increased percentages of households with unimproved water access, unimproved sanitation facilities, deprivation of women's autonomy, unemployment of women, and lower wealth index contributed to the increased CIAF rate in the zone.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The CIAF risk factors are spatially and temporally correlated across 72 administrative zones in Ethiopia. There exist geographical differences in CIAF among the zones, which are influenced by spatial neighborhoods of the zone and temporal lags within the zone. Hence these findings emphasize the need to take the spatial neighborhood and historical/temporal contexts into account when planning CIAF prevention."

We evaluated the effect of a randomized sanitation program (providing households with an improved dual-pit latrine, tools for child/animal feces management, and behavioral messaging) on reducing the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in soil from household courtyards. We collected soil samples from 1405 households enrolled in the sanitation intervention (n = 419) and control (n = 914) groups of a cluster-randomized controlled trial (WASH Benefits) in rural Bangladesh approximately 2 years after the initiation of the interventions. We analyzed samples for Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm eggs by microscopy. We estimated prevalence ratios (PR) and egg count ratio (ECR) to compare the prevalence of STH eggs and arithmetic and geometric mean egg counts for STH eggs per gram of soil in the sanitation and control arms. Among intervention households, latrines achieved high and sustained user uptake by adults while child open defecation remained common and most households did not dispose of child feces hygienically. In courtyard soil from control households, the prevalence of any STH eggs was 75.7% and the prevalence of any larvated STH eggs was 67.3%. A. lumbricoides was detected in 63.0% of control samples and T. trichiura in 55.7% of control samples; hookworm was not detected in any sample. In the control arm, the arithmetic mean egg count for any STH was 3.96 eggs/dry gram, while the geometric mean was 1.58 eggs/dry gram. There was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the prevalence of any STH eggs (PR = 0.98 (95% CI: 0.91, 1.05)) or mean egg counts (ECR = 0.08 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.26) for geometric mean and 0.07 (95% CI: -0.22, 0.37) for arithmetic mean). Adjusted models gave similar results. A compound-level sanitation intervention that provided improved latrines and tools for disposal of child and animal feces did not have an impact on STH eggs in soil. In order to effectively reduce the prevalence and concentration of STH eggs in the environment, sustained, widespread use of sanitation strategies to isolate and hygienically dispose of child and animal feces may need to complement traditional strategies for containment of adult human feces.

The objective of this review is to evaluate the nutritional status and dietary intakes of children (0-12 years) in selected EMR countries, namely, Jordan, Lebanon, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), and the United Arab Emirates. MedLine, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles published between 1990 and 2016; international organizations and governmental websites were also searched. Stunting in the region was estimated at 7.3% to 9.3%, wasting at 1.1% to 11.8%, and underweight at 1.6% to 5.3%. In contrast, overweight and obesity affected 19% to 21% of school-aged children from Lebanon and KSA. Available biochemical data showed that pediatric anemia, vitamin A, and vitamin D deficiencies remain a challenge in the region. Dietary intake studies have identified inadequate intakes of iron, calcium, zinc, folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin D, concurrently with high intakes of fat, saturated fat, and sugar. This review provides valuable insight into the nutrition situation of children in 2 major areas of the EMR, the Levant and the Gulf, and identified several gaps and challenges in existing nutritional assessment studies. Key issues include the triple burden of malnutrition in this age group (underweight, nutrient inadequacies, and overweight/obesity), while calling for integrated action to improve the nutritional status of children in countries of the region. Opportunities for future research include nationwide nutritional and dietary surveys in countries where the largest data gaps remain such as the United Arab Emirates and KSA."

Given the challenge of blinding most water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions, diarrheal disease outcome measures in WASH intervention trials are subject to potential bias and misclassification. Using the platform of a cluster-randomized controlled trial of a household-based drinking water filter in western province, Rwanda, we assessed the impact of the drinking water filter on enteric seroconversion in young children as a health outcome and examined the association between serologic responses and caregiver-reported diarrhea. Among the 2,179 children enrolled in the trial, 189 children 6-12 months of age were enrolled in a nested serology study. These children had their blood drawn at baseline and 6-12 months after the intervention was distributed. Multiplex serologic assays for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica, norovirus, Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae were performed. Despite imperfect uptake, receipt of the water filter was associated with a significant decrease in seroprevalence of IgG directed against Cryptosporidium parvum Cp17 and Cp23 (relative risk [RR]: 0.62, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44-0.89). Serologic responses were positively associated with reported diarrhea in the previous 7 days for both Giardia intestinalis (RR: 1.94, 95% CI: 1.04-3.63) and C. parvum (RR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.09-4.50). Serologic responses for all antigens generally increased in the follow-up round, rising sharply after 12 months of age. The water filter is associated with reduced serologic responses against C. parvum, a proxy for exposure and infection; therefore, serologic responses against protozoa may be a suitable health outcome measure for WASH trials among children with diarrhea."

The evaluation employed a randomized control trial (RCT) design. Baseline knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) relating to STH were obtained using a questionnaire from 372 pupils across six schools in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Schools were randomly assigned into intervention and control group, with the former and latter receiving Worms and Ladders and the common Snake and Ladder board game respectively. Fresh stool samples were also collected at baseline for STH diagnosis before administering 400mg single dose albendazole. Follow-up assessments of STH burden and KAP were conducted three and six months' post-intervention. Data generated from the study were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 software, with confidence interval set at 95%. Prevalence of STH dropped from 25.0% to 10.4% in the intervention group and 49.4% to 33.3% in the control group at three months' post-intervention. The prevalence further dropped to 5.6% in the intervention group at six months' post-intervention. However, it increased to 37.2% in the control group at six months' post-intervention. There was a significant difference (p<0.05) in prevalence after intervention among the groups.

These were household index cases seen in general practice in a London borough during the years 1953-68. An annual average of about 2 per cent of households in the area were affected, but there was considerable fluctuation with year and season. Half the patients were children although only one-fifth of the population at risk was under 15 years of age. The greatest incidence of diarrhoea was among children under 5 years old. Male children, but female adults predominated. Specimens were sent for laboratory diagnosis at the discretion of the general practitioner. The laboratory found some abnormality in nearly a third and there were indications that transmissible infection was involved in about one-fifth of patients. The most common diagnosis was Sonne dysentery (9 per cent) which came in epidemic waves and made its greatest impact among young school children. Microscopy was useful, and giardiasis was diagnosed in 1-4 per cent of index patients. Other parasites were less commonly found. Fatty globules characteristic of an infectious condition we have called 'fatty diarrhoea' were frequently observed by microscopy in stools from young children and occasionally from older persons. Blood or pus cells were seen in less than half the shigella and salmonella infections and in a much smaller proportion of the remainder. A test for occult blood performed on specimens from all patients of 40 years or older was positive, in the absence of visible red cells, in a tenth of these cases. Other studies on the bacteriology of diarrhoea in general practice are referred to and some epidemiological comparisons made.

We believe that these two disease groups share common risk factors, namely inadequate household water management, poor sanitation and solid waste management. Where water provision is inadequate, water storage is essential. Aedes mosquitoes commonly breed in household water storage containers, which can hold water contaminated with enteric disease-causing organisms. Microbiological contamination of water between source and point-of-use is a major cause of reduced drinking-water quality. Inadequate sanitation and solid waste management increase not only risk of water contamination, but also the availability of mosquito larval habitats. In this article we discuss integrated interventions that interrupt mosquito breeding while also providing sanitary environments and clean water. Specific interventions include improving storage container design, placement and maintenance and scaling up access to piped water. Vector control can be integrated into sanitation projects that target sewers and drains to avoid accumulation of stagnant water. Better management of garbage and solid waste can reduce the availability of mosquito habitats while improving human living conditions. Our proposed integration of disease interventions is consistent with strategies promoted in several global health frameworks, such as the sustainable development goals, the global vector control response, behavioural change, and water, sanitation and hygiene initiatives. Future research should address how interventions targeting water, sanitation, hygiene and community waste disposal also benefit Aedes-borne disease control. The projected effects of climate change mean that integrated management and control strategies will become increasingly important."

We studied whether a water quality intervention could improve child growth in a rural Indian setting with higher levels of circulating pathogens than the original trial sites.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We analysed a cross-sectional dataset including a microbiological measure of household water quality. All households accessed water from an improved source. We applied propensity score methods to emulate a randomised trial investigating the hypothesis that receipt of drinking water meeting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.1 quality standards for absence of faecal contamination leads to improved growth. Growth outcomes (stunting, underweight, wasting, and their corresponding Z-scores) were assessed in children 12-23 months of age. For each outcome, we estimated the mean and 95% confidence interval of the absolute risk difference between treatment groups.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Of 1088 households, 442 (40.62%) received drinking water meeting SDG 6.1 standards. The adjusted risk of child underweight was 7.4% (1.3% to 13.4%) lower among those drinking water satisfying SDG 6.1 norms than among controls. Evidence concerning the relationship of drinking water meeting SDG 6.1 norms to length-for-age and weight-for-age was inconclusive, and there was no apparent relationship with stunting or wasting.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In contexts characterised by high pathogen transmission, water quality improvements have the potential to reduce the proportion of underweight children, but are unlikely to impact stunting or wasting. Further research is required to assess how these modelled benefits can best be achieved in real world settings."

Policies and programmatic efforts increasingly address health and non-health determinants of undernutrition. In Nepal, one large-scale integrated nutrition program, Suaahara, aimed to reduce undernutrition among women and children in the 1,000-day period, while simultaneously addressing inequities. In this study, we use household-level process evaluation data (N = 480) to assess levels of exposure to program inputs and levels of knowledge and practices related to health, nutrition, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). We also assess Suaahara's effect on the differences between disadvantaged (DAG) and non-disadvantaged households in exposure, knowledge, and practice indicators. All regression models were adjusted for potential confounders at the child-, maternal-, and household levels, as well as clustering. We found a higher prevalence of almost all exposure and knowledge indicators and some practice indicators in Suaahara areas versus comparison areas. A higher proportion of DAG households in Suaahara areas reported exposure, were knowledgeable, and practiced optimal behaviors related to nearly all maternal and child health, nutrition, and WASH indicators than DAG households in non-Suaahara areas and sometimes even than non-DAG households in Suaahara areas. Moreover, differences in some of these indicators between DAG and non-DAG households were significantly smaller in Suaahara areas than in comparison areas. These results indicate that large-scale integrated interventions can influence nutrition-related knowledge and practices, while simultaneously reducing inequities."

Biannual mass de-worming targeting children aged 3-18 years started in 1994 and was continued until 2005.

Multivariate analysis was carried out using logistic regression, to identify risk factors for infection. Faecal samples were obtained from 1890 children. In 4/5 districts, >20% were infected with one or more helminth species. Overall combined prevalence was 29.0%; 11.6% had infections of moderate-heavy intensity. The commonest infection was Ascaris lumbricoides, present in all five districts, as was Trichuris trichiura. Hookworm was not detected in two districts. Multivariate analysis identified low altitude and maternal under-education as risk factors for all three infections.

We identify routes of contamination by animal feces, control measures to reduce human exposure, and propose research priorities for further inquiry. Exposure to animal feces has been associated with diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth infection, trachoma, environmental enteric dysfunction, and growth faltering. Few studies have evaluated control measures, but interventions include reducing cohabitation with animals, provision of animal feces scoops, controlling animal movement, creating safe child spaces, improving veterinary care, and hygiene promotion. Future research should evaluate: behaviors related to points of contact with animal feces; animal fecal contamination of food; cultural behaviors of animal fecal management; acute and chronic health risks associated with exposure to animal feces; and factors influencing concentrations and shedding rates of pathogens originating from animal feces."

In addition to direct health impacts of these infections, including anaemia and nutritional deficiencies in children, these infections also significantly impact economic development, as a result of delays in early childhood cognitive development and future income earning potential. The current World Health Organization strategy for STH is focused on morbidity control through the application of mass drug administration to all pre-school-aged and school-aged children. In India, the control of STH-related morbidity requires mobilization of significant human and financial resources, placing additional burdens on limited public resources. Infected adults and untreated children in the community act as a reservoir of infection by which treated children get rapidly reinfected. As a result, deworming programmes will need to be sustained indefinitely in the absence of other strategies to reduce reinfection, including water, hygiene and sanitation interventions (WASH). However, WASH interventions require sustained effort by the government or other agencies to build infrastructure and to promote healthy behavioural modifications, and their effectiveness is often limited by deeply entrenched cultural norms and behaviours. Novel strategies must be explored to provide a lasting solution to the problem of STH infections in India other than the indefinite provision of deworming for morbidity control."

Conversely, BMI-for-age z-score (BAZ) increases by 0.13 sd/year in early adolescence vs 0.02 sd/year in late adolescence, and underweight decreases by 12.8 pp vs 3.2 pp. Adolescent girls in all socioeconomic groups show a similar pattern of HAZ and BAZ dynamics, but the curve for the richest quintile stays above that of the poorest across all ages.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Trends and levels of stunting and underweight among adolescent girls in Bangladesh are worrisome, suggesting substantial linear growth faltering in early adolescence, with improving weight-for-age occurring only as linear growth slows and stops. Given the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Bangladesh and emerging evidence of the link between stunting and later chronic diseases, greater attention to adolescent growth and development is needed.

In low-income countries, weaning is a period of dietary transition from milk to plant-based foods and a high-risk period for malnutrition. We explored how diet and malnutrition impact hair δ15N and δ13C in young children by an observational, cross-sectional study in Cox's Bazar District, Bangladesh [255 children, 6-59 months with 19.6% wasted (7.1% severely) and 36% stunted (9.8% severely)]. Hair δ15N and δ13C exhibited exponential decreases with age, with the loss of one trophic level (3.3‰ and 0.8‰, respectively) from 6 to 48 months, which we associate with the shift from exclusive breastfeeding to complete weaning. After adjustment for age and breastfeeding status, hair isotopic values were unaffected by wasting but lower in severe stunting (-0.45‰ to -0.6‰, P < 0.01). In this population of young children, whose isotopic values in hair primarily depended on age, we failed to observe any effect of wasting, likely due to opposite, compensating effects between dietary and metabolic changes involved. In contrast, we evidenced low δ15N and δ13C values in severely stunted children that likely indicate chronic exposure to diets low in animal products."

Therefore, this is an attempt at recognising the concept of level sensitivity while verifying the association between prevalence of diarrhoea in under-five children in a district and its corresponding coverage of improved water supply and sanitation and hygiene. Information obtained in the DLHS-4 including 275 districts from 19 states and 2 union territories of India forms the database for this analysis. Universal access to safe drinking water, improving coverage of sanitation in a district beyond 71 percent across the country and beyond 78 percent among the non-south DLHS districts, has the potential to realise reductions in the prevalence of diarrhoea in under-five children in a district. The effect of improved sanitation seems to work synergistically with these indicators only at better levels of prevalence of diarrhoea in under-five children in a district. This offers lessons for the Clean India Mission in terms of universalising access to safe water and coverage up to three-fourths of households with sanitation in a district for the positive externalities to manifest in reduced prevalence of diarrhoea in under-five children."

We conducted a policy review to examine the presence and associations of nutrition policies and governance with the children's nutrition statuses in LAMICs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We reviewed nutrition policies, nutrition governance, and the trends of nutrition status from LAMICs. We retrieved data on the policies from the global database on the implementation of nutrition actions (GINA). We also retrieved data on the trends of nutrition status and nutrition governance from the nutrition landscape information system (NLiS), and on LAMICs from the World Bank database. We then analyzed the data both descriptively and by using a mixed effects model with random-intercept by country.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 139 LAMICs reviewed, only 39.6% had policies to address both undernutrition and overweight/obesity. A higher proportion of low-income countries (LICs) had policies to address undernutrition compared to that of middle-income countries (MICs) (86.1% vs. 63.1%, p = 0.002), and a low proportion of both had policy to address overweight. Having a nutrition policy that addresses undernutrition was not associated with better nutrition status outcomes. Strong nutrition governance in LAMICS was associated with low magnitudes of stunting (beta = -4.958, p = 0.015); wasting (beta = -5.418, p = 0.003); and underweight (beta = -6.452, p = 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Despite high magnitudes of undernutrition and overweight/obesity in LAMICs, only about one third of them had nutrition policies to address such nutrition transition.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Multiple specialized nutritious food options are programmed for supplementation in humanitarian and development settings. However, comparative cost-effectiveness evidence is lacking, let alone incorporation of perspectives from uncompensated stakeholders. A Burkina Faso trial evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Corn Soy Blend Plus w/ oil (CSB+ w/oil, reference arm), Corn Soy Whey Blend w/oil (CSWB w/oil), Super Cereal Plus (SC+), and Ready-to-Use Supplementary Food (RUSF) in reducing stunting and wasting among children 6-23 months old. This paper presents cost-effectiveness findings from multiple stakeholders' perspectives, including caregivers and program volunteers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An activity-based costing with ingredients approach was used to summarize cost of the 18-month-long blanket supplementary feeding for each enrolled child (in 2018 USD). Time data were collected using self-reported and observational instruments. Cost-effectiveness relative to CSB+ w/oil assessed incremental cost per enrolled child against incremental outcomes: prevalence of stunting at 23 months of age and number of months of wasting. Two combined perspectives were compared: program (donor, implementer, and volunteer) versus program and caregiver (adding caregiver).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 6112 children were enrolled. While similar effectiveness was found in three arms (CSWB w/oil was less effective), costs differed. Product cost and caregiver time to prepare study foods were major drivers of cross-arm cost differences from the respective combined perspective. The two major drivers were used to construct uncertainty ranges of cost per enrolled child from program and caregiver perspective: $317 ($279- $355) in CSB+ w/oil, $350 ($327- $373) in CSWB w/oil, $387 ($371- $403) in RUSF, and $434 ($365- $503) in SC+. Cost from program and caregiver perspective was a substantial increase from program perspective. CSB+ w/oil was most cost-effective in reducing stunting and wasting, and this main finding was robust to changing perspectives and all corresponding sensitivity analyses when uncompensated time was valued at minimum wage ($0.36/h). The break-even point for uncompensated time valuation is >$0.84/h, where RUSF became the most cost-effective from the program and caregiver perspective. Relative cost-effectiveness rankings among the other three arms depended on choice of perspectives, and were sensitive to values assigned to product cost, international freight cost, opportunity cost of time, and outcomes of a hypothetical control. Volunteer opportunity cost did not affect arm comparisons, but lack of compensation resulted in negative financial consequences for caregivers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Evaluating cost-effectiveness by incorporating uncompensated stakeholders provided crucial implementation insights around nutrition products and programming.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Trial registration number: NCT02071563.

            "abstract": "If interventions promoting improved hygiene behaviour to prevent childhood diarrhoea are to be implemented and evaluated, valid methods for measuring this behaviour will be required. This paper presents findings from a study to investigate the use of structured observations to measure hygiene behaviour in Burkina Faso. Two hundred mothers with young children (2-36 months) were observed on several occasions, with particular attention focused on events/behaviour surrounding defaecation. Child defaecation occurred most often in a potty (67% of occasions). Stools were most often disposed of into a latrine (79%). Following defaecation the child's bottom was usually rinsed using water alone with a bare hand (76%). Subsequent hand washing by the mother/caretaker was much rarer (29%). None of these behaviours appeared \"reactive\" to the presence of the observer. Less common behaviors showed some evidence of reactivity. The frequency of child defaecation in the yard increased over the course of three observations (5% to 16%; P = 0.01) and the proportion of occasions on which the child was observed to be cleaned after defaecation declined (95% to 85%; P = 0.01). Mothers usually took with them to the latrine a water recipient (91%). Hand washing after leaving the latrine was observed on 30% of occasions. This proportion declined from 36% to 22% over three observations (P = 0.05). Defaecation by older siblings (aged 3-5 years) was usually into a potty (48%) or directly in a latrine (30%). There was no evidence that this behaviour was reactive. The repeatability of behaviours at the individual level was generally low. The site of index child defaecation (kappa = 0.27), how the child's bottom was cleaned (kappa = -0.01) and whether the caretaker washed her hands afterwards (kappa = 0.26) all showed low repeatability. The method of stool disposal was more repeatable (kappa = 0.73). Hand washing by mothers after using the latrine showed moderate repeatability (kappa = 0.40). Older sibling's defaecation behavior had excellent repeatability (kappa = 0.90). Our findings suggest that, in studies which aim to measure behaviour at the population level, structured observations may provide a useful tool. Studies which investigate links between hygiene behaviour and diarrhoea incidence at the individual level will require repeated observations of mothers and children since measuring behaviour during a single observation will lead to misclassification of exposure status, resulting in bias which could mask any underlying association. This is likely to be very costly."

The objectives of this paper were to (1) determine the prevalence of helminth infections among women; (2) investigate interactions among intestinal helminth species in individuals and (3) identify risk factors that contribute to intestinal helminth infections. In a nationwide survey conducted in 1995, 9550 households in 53 provinces were covered using a stratified two-stage cluster survey. Stool specimens were examined by Kato-Katz technique. Of 5,127 women, 76% were infected with one or more helminth species, 36% with hookworm, 59% with Ascaris lumbricoides and 28% with Trichuris trichiura. A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura were more likely to be concurrent than expected by chance. There was significant interaction between prevalence and intensity of infection in all three species. All three helminth species were more common in certain ecologic zones than others. Hookworm infection was associated with farming [Odd ratio (OR) = 2.1] and lack of a closed latrine (OR = 2.0), A. lumbricoides with use of untreated feces as fertilizer (OR = 1.2) and coinfection with T. trichiura (OR = 2.1) and T trichiura with A. lumbricoides co-infection (OR = 2.1). Our findings suggest that reproductive-age women, especially rural farmers, should be included among the high priority groups for helminth control programs through mass chemotherapy and improving sanitation."

            "abstract": "There are few data available on the incidence of endemic waterborne disease in the developed world. This study aims to determine if there was a measurable decline in gastroenteritis related faecal specimens following the introduction of water treatment. The rate of faecal specimens for gastroenteritis was obtained for 17 communities one year before and after the introduction of water treatment in two states of Australia between 1992 and 1996. Of these 17 systems, 10 had filtration added to existing disinfection, while seven had both disinfection and filtration or disinfection alone added to no existing treatment. The rate of faecal sampling varied from a reduction of 55% to an increase of 198%. Large changes in water quality parameters occurred following treatment but there was no significant correlation between these changes and changes in the rate of faecal specimens. In this study there was no consistent change in gastrointestinal related faecal specimens despite marked changes in water quality. This suggests that the reduction in endemic gastrointestinal disease as a result of the introduction of water treatment was small as a percentage of all gastroenteritis. However, water treatment remains essential to protecting public health."

            "abstract": "Intestinal parasitic infections are among the most common infections of humans in developing countries, but the resources available for their control are severely limited. Careful evaluation of control measures is essential to ensure that they are cost-effective. The evaluation of the effects of control on intestinal helminths and intestinal protozoa requires an understanding of the different epidemiological patterns of these two groups of parasites. The transmission dynamics and morbidity associated with the major helminth infections (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms) are dependent on the size of the worm burdens. Thus the important parameter for evaluating the impact of control on morbidity and transmission is the intensity of infection, which can be assessed by determining the mean density of parasite eggs in faecal specimens. Estimation of intensity is subject to systematic errors, however, due to the complex pattern of worm burden distributions. The frequency distribution of burdens is highly overdispersed, and individuals exhibit predisposition to particular levels of infection. Furthermore, mean intensity is age-dependent, in a species-specific manner, and is clustered spatially and within families. These complex patterns imply that the estimation of intensity is exceptionally sensitive to the size and demographic structure of the population sample selected for assessment. They also have the effect that prevalence estimates, the most commonly used measures of infection in communities, can seriously mislead. Paradoxically, prevalence is least useful where infection is most common because the relationship between prevalence and intensity is most markedly non-linear when the prevalence is high. Thus in areas where control is most needed, evaluation using prevalence might suggest that control had failed while evaluation by intensity would, correctly, show the measure of success. With the major protozoan infections (Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium parvum) an estimate of intensity is of little value and the central parameter for evaluation is prevalence. Prevalence does exhibit age and spatial heterogeneity, which may be species-specific, so there remains a need to ensure a consistent sample structure, although this is less critical than for the helminths. The major constraint on evaluating the control of protozoan infections is the need to identify pathogenic species and, in some cases, pathogenic strains. Harmless commensal protozoans are ubiquitous and often morphologically very similar to pathogens, but their control is both unnecessary and impracticable. Species such a E. histolytica appear to exist as strains with differing pathogenicity, thus control will be cost-effective only if the focus is on pathogenic strains. Effective diagnosis is therefore central to the evaluation of the control of protozoan infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

The sample sizes in the three waves were 33,816, 30,383, and 28,876 children, respectively. After excluding observations missing on the child anthropometric measures and the independent variables included in the study, the analytic sample size was 28,066, 26,121, and 23,139, respectively, with a pooled sample size of 77,326 children.

We estimated fixed and random effects logistic models that accounted for the clustering of the data. In models that did not account for survey-period effects, there appeared to be an inverse association between state economic growth and risk of undernutrition among children. However, in models accounting for data structure related to repeated cross-sectional design through survey period effects, state economic growth was not associated with the risk of underweight (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98, 1.04), stunting (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.99, 1.05), and wasting (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.96, 1.02).

Morbidity was associated with specific helminth species infection (e.g. S. mekongi with hepatomegaly; adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 9.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.07-43.51) and multiparasitism (e.g. two or more helminth species with abdominal pain; aOR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.46-3.93). Anaemia was associated with hookworm infection (aOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.16-2.34) and multiparasitism (aOR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.18-2.29). Low BMI was associated with O. viverrini infection (aOR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.14-2.49) and multiparasitism (aOR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.01-2.00). The multiple strong associations reported here between helminth infections (single or multiple species) and intestinal morbidity among children in rural parts of southern Lao PDR call for concerted efforts to control helminth infections, which in turn might improve children's health and development."

            "abstract": "The proper management of fecal sludge (FS), to block the transmission pathways of pathogens, is rarely enforced in many parts of the world. Health risks associated with different disposal practices of FS in peri-urban settings of a large metropolis in Thailand were assessed; Tha Klong sub-district with indiscriminate FS dumping, and Klong Luang sub-district which has an FS treatment system. The study showed that indiscriminate FS dumping from along the canal banks and discharge of market waste were likely the major sources of E. coli and Salmonella spp. in contamination of the canal water. The increased microbial pathogen concentrations near the FS treatment facility also indicated contamination risks from poorly designed treatment facilities. Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) indicated very high water-related infection risk levels compared to the actual locally recorded disease occurrences. These results indicated that the QMRA model needs to be modified to take account of immunological differences between populations in developed countries, where the model was developed, and developing countries. In addition, further sensitivity factors are needed to reflect different societal behavior patterns, and therefore contact with potentially contaminated water, in different sub-populations of many less developed communities."

            "title": "Growth faltering in low-income countries.",
            "abstract": "Meta-analysis of growth data from over 50 low and low-middle income countries shows a consistent pattern of stunting and poor weight gain from about 3 months of age and persisting until at least 5 years. Children tend not to be wasted because their short stature offsets their underweight, leading to a rather adequately proportioned appearance. This frequently conceals the true levels of malnutrition in communities. At the macro-environmental level such growth faltering is due to the combined effects of poverty, food insecurity, low-dietary diversity, a highly infectious environment, poor washing facilities and poor understanding of the principles of nutrition and hygiene. These tend to be ameliorated as communities pass through the demographic transition with improved incomes and education. Because such changes will take generations to achieve, the global health community continues to search for effective interim solutions. Disappointingly, apart from intensive feeding programmes aimed at rehabilitating severely malnourished children, there are few examples of very successful nutrition interventions. This emphasizes the need for a better understanding of the etiology of growth failure. This paper uses anthropometric data collected over 6 decades in subsistence-farming communities from rural Gambia to illustrate the typical key features of growth faltering. Arising from this analysis, and from gaps in the published literature, the following issues are highlighted as still requiring a better resolution: (1) the pre-natal and inter-generational influences on growth failure; (2) the ontogeny of the infant immune system; (3) the exact nature of the precipitating insults that initiate gastroenteropathy; (4) the effects of both enteric and systemic infections on the hormonal regulation of growth; (5) interactions between macro- and micro-nutrient deficiencies and infections in causing growth failure, and (6) the role of the microbiome in modulating dietary influences on health and growth."

In all three agroclimatic situations, the largest percentage of children fell in the HAZ SD1 (stunted) category (15.3% in the high hills, 7.3% in the middle hills, and 9.5% in the low hills). There is a significant effect of area (rural vs. urban) on stunting and wasting among children. The child's sex affects stunting only.

Design/methodology/approach In total, 19 hospitals (15 public and four private) were selected. The WSH services were assessed in hospitals using the WSH in health facilities assessment tool developed for this purpose. Findings All hospitals (100 percent) had a safe water source and most (84.2 percent) had functional water sources to provide enough water for users' needs. All hospitals had appropriate and sufficient gender separated toilets in the wards and 84.2 percent had the same in outpatient settings. Overall, 84.2 percent had sufficient and functioning handwashing basins with soap and water, and 79.0 percent had sufficient showers. Healthcare waste management was appropriately practiced in all hospitals. Practical implications Jordan hospital managers achieved major achievements providing access to drinking water and improved sanitation. However, there are still areas that need improvements, such as providing toilets for patients with special needs, establishing handwashing basins with water and soap near toilets, toilet maintenance and providing sufficient trolleys for collecting hazardous waste. Efforts are needed to integrate WSH service policies with existing national policies on environmental health in health facilities, establish national standards and targets for the various healthcare facilities to increase access and improve services. Originality/value There are limited WSH data on healthcare facilities and targets for basic coverage in healthcare facilities are also lacking. A new assessment tool was developed to generate core WSH indicators and to assess WSH services in Jordan's healthcare facilities. This tool can be used by a non-WSH specialist to quickly assess healthcare facility-related WSH services and sanitary hazards in other countries. This tool identified some areas that need improvements."

We searched grey literature databases, conference proceedings and websites, reviewed reference lists and contacted experts and authors.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised (including cluster-randomised), quasi-randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, controlled cohort or cross-sectional studies and historically controlled studies, comparing WASH interventions among children aged under 18 years.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently sought and extracted data on childhood anthropometry, biochemical measures of micronutrient status, and adherence, attrition and costs either from published reports or through contact with study investigators. We calculated mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted study-level and individual-level meta-analyses to estimate pooled measures of effect for randomised controlled trials only.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Fourteen studies (five cluster-randomised controlled trials and nine non-randomised studies with comparison groups) from 10 low- and middle-income countries including 22,241 children at baseline and nutrition outcome data for 9,469 children provided relevant information. Study duration ranged from 6 to 60 months and all studies included children under five years of age at the time of the intervention. Studies included WASH interventions either singly or in combination. Measures of child anthropometry were collected in all 14 studies, and nine studies reported at least one of the following anthropometric indices: weight-for-height, weight-for-age or height-for-age. None of the included studies were of high methodological quality as none of the studies masked the nature of the intervention from participants.Weight-for-age, weight-for-height and height-for-age z-scores were available for five cluster-randomised controlled trials with a duration of between 9 and 12 months. Meta-analysis including 4,627 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight-for-age z-score (MD 0.05; 95% CI -0.01 to 0.12). Meta-analysis including 4,622 children identified no evidence of an effect of WASH interventions on weight-for-height z-score (MD 0.02; 95% CI -0.07 to 0.11). Meta-analysis including 4,627 children identified a borderline statistically significant effect of WASH interventions on height-for-age z-score (MD 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). These findings were supported by individual participant data analysis including information on 5,375 to 5,386 children from five cluster-randomised controlled trials.No study reported adverse events. Adherence to study interventions was reported in only two studies (both cluster-randomised controlled trials) and ranged from low (< 35%) to high (> 90%). Study attrition was reported in seven studies and ranged from 4% to 16.5%. Intervention cost was reported in one study in which the total cost of the WASH interventions was USD 15/inhabitant. None of the studies reported differential impacts relevant to equity issues such as gender, socioeconomic status and religion.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The available evidence from meta-analysis of data from cluster-randomised controlled trials with an intervention period of 9-12 months is suggestive of a small benefit of WASH interventions (specifically solar disinfection of water, provision of soap, and improvement of water quality) on length growth in children under five years of age. The duration of the intervention studies was relatively short and none of the included studies is of high methodological quality. Very few studies provided information on intervention adherence, attrition and costs. There are several ongoing trials in low-income country settings that may provide robust evidence to inform these findings."

Shifting dietary pattern and rapid increase in overweight/obesity among adults with persistent child undernutrition indicate that India is experiencing nutrition transition and double burden of malnutrition. Hence, the study explores the presence of and the factors associated with mother-child dyads of over- and undernutrition in India.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and materials:\n        \n      \n      The study uses National Family Health Survey 2015-16 data. The analytic sample consists of 28,817 weighted mother-child pairs where an overweight/obese mother is paired with an undernourished child. The nutritional status of children is defined according to WHO 2006 child growth standards as underweight (i.e., low weight-for-age), stunting (i.e., low height-for-age) and wasting (i.e., low weight-for-height). Maternal overweight/obesity (i.e., BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) is defined using adult BMI criterion.

            "abstract": "Vitamin A, a fat-soluble, heat-stable nutrient (retinol) derived from animal sources and certain fruits and vegetables, forms the basic component of retinal pigments and plays a vital role in optimal health, growth, and development. Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) (serum retinol < or = 20 microg/dL [< or = 0.7 micromol/L] for subclinical VAD) can substantially increase the risk for childhood mortality from infectious and noninfectious causes. VAD impairs the mobilization and transport of iron and is usually associated with anemia and reduced growth. VAD is a major public health problem in parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Western Pacific. In Chuuk and Pohnpei, two of the four Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) (2000 population: 107,008), nutrition surveys during the early 1990s documented VAD prevalences among the highest in the world (CDC, unpublished data, 1991; U.S. Public Health Service, unpublished data, 1994). In response to these findings, FSM health authorities, with support of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), began distributing vitamin A supplements in 1993 and 1998 in Chuuk and Pohnpei, respectively. In November 1999, FSM requested assistance from CDC in VAD assessment surveys of children in Kosrae and Yap, the other two FSM states. This report summarizes levels of serum retinol and prevalence of VAD and other indicators of nutritional status among children aged 24-59 months in Kosrae and Yap. The findings indicated low serum retinol levels and high VAD prevalences but no substantial stunting or wasting. A comprehensive, long-term national strategy is needed in FSM to promote sustained improvement in vitamin A status."

            "abstract": "Herd immunity arises when a communicable disease is less able to propagate because a substantial portion of the population is immune. Nonimmunizing interventions, such as insecticide-treated bednets and deworming drugs, have shown similar herd-protective effects. Less is known about the herd protection from drinking water, sanitation, and hand hygiene (WASH) interventions. We first constructed a transmission model to illustrate mechanisms through which different WASH interventions may provide herd protection. We then conducted an extensive review of the literature to assess the validity of the model results and identify current gaps in research. The model suggests that herd protection accounts for a substantial portion of the total protection provided by WASH interventions. However, both the literature and the model suggest that sanitation interventions in particular are the most likely to provide herd protection, since they reduce environmental contamination. Many studies fail to account for these indirect effects and thus underestimate the total impact an intervention may have. Although cluster-randomized trials of WASH interventions have reported the total or overall efficacy of WASH interventions, they have not quantified the role of herd protection. Just as it does in immunization policy, understanding the role of herd protection from WASH interventions can help inform coverage targets and strategies that indirectly protect those that are unable to be reached by WASH campaigns. Toward this end, studies are needed to confirm the differential role that herd protection plays across the WASH interventions suggested by our transmission model."

            "abstract": "An educational intervention was designed to improve three water-sanitation behaviors empirically shown to be associated with high rates of childhood diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh: lack of handwashing before preparing food, open defecation by children in the family compound, and inattention to proper disposal of garbage and feces, increasing the opportunity for young children to place waste products in their mouth. Fifty-one communities, each comprising 38 families, were randomized either to receive (n = 25) or not to receive (n = 26) the intervention. During the six months after the intervention, the rate of diarrhea (per 100 person-weeks) in children under six years of age was 4.3 in the intervention communities and 5.8 in the control communities (26% protective efficacy; p less than 0.0001). A corresponding improvement in handwashing practices before preparing food was noted, although no improvement was observed for defecation and waste disposal practices. These data suggest that educational interventions for water-sanitation practices can have an important beneficial effect upon childhood diarrhea in developing countries, particularly when the interventions are designed in a simple way to promote naturally occurring salutory behaviors that are empirically associated with lower rates of childhood diarrhea."

Pupil appreciation of hygiene issues was reasonable; however, the high percentage presence of E. coli on hands (71%) and the evidence of large-scale open defaecation in school grounds revealed that apparent knowledge was not put into practice. The standard of facilities for sanitation and hygiene did not significantly impact on the level of knowledge or percentage of school children's hands harbouring faecal bacteria. Evidence from pupils and teachers indicated a poor understanding of principles of disease transmission. Latrines and hand-washing facilities constructed were not child friendly.

There is increasing interest in obtaining more direct data on body composition to assess the effects of undernutrition on fat-free mass (FFM) and its constituents, such as muscle and organs, and on fat mass (FM) and its regional distribution.\n    \n\n\n          Main text:\n        \n      \n      Recent studies show that severe-acute undernutrition, categorised as 'wasting', is associated with major deficits in both FFM and FM that may persist in the long-term. Fat distribution appears more central, but this is more associated with the loss of peripheral fat than with the elevation of central fat. Chronic undernutrition, categorised as 'stunting', is associated with deficits in FFM and in specific components, such as organ size. However, the magnitude of these deficits is reduced, or - in some cases - disappears, after adjustment for height. This suggests that FFM is largely reduced in proportion to linear growth. Stunted children vary in their FM - in some cases remaining thin throughout childhood, but in other cases developing higher levels of FM. The causes of this heterogeneity remain unclear. Several different pathways may underlie longitudinal associations between early stunting and later body composition. Importantly, recent studies suggest that short children are not at risk of excess fat deposition in the short term when given nutritional supplementation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The short- and long-term functional significance of FFM and FM for survival, physical capacity and non-communicable disease risk means that both tissues merit further attention in research on child undernutrition."

Data from a cohort of HIV-negative pregnant women-infant pairs were collected prospectively in Tanzania. Small for gestational age [SGA, birthweight (BW) <10th percentile] was used as proxy for IUGR. Anthropometry was measured monthly until 18 months. Length-for-age (LAZ), weight-for-length (WLZ), and weight-for-age (WAZ) z-scores were calculated using the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards. Stunting, wasting and underweight were defined as binary outcomes using a cut-off of <-2 SD of the respective z-scores. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the associations between preterm and SGA to time to stunting, wasting and underweight. The study included 6664 singletons. Preterm and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants had slightly better nutritional status than term-SGA infants and despite some catch-up growth, preterm-SGA infants had the poorest nutritional status. The gap in LAZ and WAZ z-scores among the groups remained similar throughout the follow-up. Compared with term-AGA babies, relative risk (RR) of stunting among preterm-AGA babies was 2.13 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.93-2.36), RR among term-SGA was 2.21 (95% CI 2.02-2.41) and the highest risk was among the babies who were both preterm and SGA (RR = 7.58, 95% CI 5.41-10.64). Similar magnitude of RR of underweight was observed among the three groups. Preterm and SGA infants should be closely monitored for growth failure.

We evaluated the effect of providing households with a pit latrine with a plastic slab and drophole cover, child feces management tools, and associated behavioral messaging on reducing STH eggs in household soil. We collected soil samples from 2107 households (898 control and 1209 improved sanitation intervention households) that were enrolled in the WASH Benefits cluster randomized controlled trial in rural Kenya and performed a post-intervention analysis after two years of intervention exposure. Following a pre-specified analysis plan, we combined all households that received the sanitation intervention into one group for comparison to control households. The prevalence of STH eggs in soil was 18.9% in control households and 17.0% in intervention households. The unadjusted prevalence ratio of total STH eggs in the intervention groups compared to the control group was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.78-1.13). The geometric mean concentration was 0.05 eggs/g dry soil in control households and intervention households. Unadjusted and adjusted models gave similar results. We found use of a shared latrine, presence of a roof over the sampling area, and the number of dogs owned at baseline was associated with an increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil; the presence of a latrine that was at least 2 years old and a latrine with a covered drophole was associated with a reduction in the prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Soil moisture content was also associated with an increased prevalence of STH eggs in soil. Our results indicate that an intervention designed to increase access to improved latrines and child feces management tools may not be enough to impact environmental occurrence of STH in endemic areas where latrine coverage is already high."

These counts fell to 0 cfu 100 ml(-1) after treatment with the mixture. The count of artificially introduced Vibrio cholerae was also reduced to 0 cfu 100 ml(-1) after treatment. Treatment of raw water altered the pH from 6.90 to 6.87, turbidity from 21.61 to 3.55 nephelometric turbidity units (NTU), residual chlorine from 0 to 0.09 mg litre(-1), conductivity from 124.03 to 229.96 µS cm(-1), and total dissolved solids from 59.40 to 199.25 mg litre(-1).

We quantified associations between home-, school-, and community-level WASH characteristics and hookworm infection-both prevalence and eggs per gram of stool (intensity)-among Togolese school children in the context of community-based chemotherapy treatments administered in the country from 2010 through 2014.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology/principal findings:\n        \n      \n      We analyzed data from two surveys conducted by the Togo Ministry of Health: a school-based survey of students aged 6-9 years across Togo conducted in 2009 and a follow-up survey in 2015, after four to five years of preventive chemotherapy. Data were available for 16,473 students attending 1,129 schools in 2009 and for 16,890 students from 1,126 schools in 2015. Between surveys, children in study schools received 0 to 8 rounds of deworming chemotherapy treatments. Few WASH conditions (only unimproved drinking water) were found to be significantly associated with the presence or absence of hookworms in an individual; however, quantitative eggs per gram of feces was associated with availability of unimproved drinking water, availability of improved drinking water either on or off school grounds, having a handwashing station with water available, and access to a sex-separate non-private or private latrine. The association between school WASH conditions and hookworm infection or burden often depended on the 2009 prevalence of infection, as more WASH characteristics were found to be significant predictors of infection among schools with high underlying endemicity of hookworm.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions/significance:\n        \n      \n      Our findings emphasize the complex and often inconsistent or unpredictable relationship between WASH and hookworm.

Boiled water was more frequently contaminated when served in a drinking cup than when stored (P < 0.01). Post-source contamination increased successively through the steps of usage from source water to the point of consumption. Boiling failed to ensure safe drinking water at the point of consumption because of easily contaminated containers and poor domestic hygiene.

We aimed to identify strategies for reducing infants and young children's (IYC) exposure to human and animal feces in rural farming families by conducting direct observation of 30 caregiver-infant dyads for 143 hours and recording water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related behaviors to identify possible pathways of fecal-oral transmission of bacteria among IYC in rural Zambia. In addition to mouthing visibly dirty hands, toys, sibling's body parts, and food, 14 IYC actively ingested 6.1 ± 2.5 (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) pieces of soil and stones and one ingested animal feces 6.0 ± 0 times in the span of 5 hours. Ninety-three percent (21 of 30) of mothers reported observing the index-child eating soil and 17% (5 of 30) of mothers reported observing the index-child eating chicken feces. Adult and child handwashing was uncommon, and even though 70% (28 of 30) of households had access to a latrine, human feces were found in 67% of homestead yards. Most animals present in the household were un-corralled, and the highest observable counts of feces came from chickens, pigs, and cattle. To protect IYC in low-income communities from the exploratory ingestion of feces and soil, Baby WASH interventions will need to interrupt fecal-oral microbial transmission vectors specific to IYC with a focus on feasibility, caregiver practices, and local perceptions of risk."

            "abstract": "The archaeological evidence for parasites in the Roman era is presented in order to demonstrate the species present at that time, and highlight the health consequences for people living under Roman rule. Despite their large multi-seat public latrines with washing facilities, sewer systems, sanitation legislation, fountains and piped drinking water from aqueducts, we see the widespread presence of whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) and Entamoeba histolytica that causes dysentery. This would suggest that the public sanitation measures were insufficient to protect the population from parasites spread by fecal contamination. Ectoparasites such as fleas, head lice, body lice, pubic lice and bed bugs were also present, and delousing combs have been found. The evidence fails to demonstrate that the Roman culture of regular bathing in the public baths reduced the prevalence of these parasites. Fish tapeworm was noted to be widely present, and was more common than in Bronze and Iron Age Europe. It is possible that the Roman enthusiasm for fermented, uncooked fish sauce (garum) may have facilitated the spread of this helminth. Roman medical practitioners such as Galen were aware of intestinal worms, explaining their existence and planning treatment using the humoural theory of the period."

We investigated whether (a) subclinical mastitis (SCM), an asymptomatic inflammation of the breast, (b) maternal intestinal nematode and protozoan infections, indicators of faecal-oral contamination, or (c) poor breastfeeding practices increased the odds of stunting (length-for-age z-score < -2SD), underweight (weight-for-age z-score < -2SD), or low head circumference (head circumference-for-age z-score < -2SD) in breastfed infants in rural indigenous communities in Guatemala. Mother-infant dyads (n = 105) were subdivided into those with and without SCM (milk Na:K ratio > 0.6). Maternal and infant anthropometry were measured at the time of breast milk collection. Maternal stool samples were examined for the presence of intestinal nematodes and protozoa. Questionnaires were used to characterize breastfeeding practices (exclusivity and frequency) and support, hygiene (latrine use and household faucet), and infant diarrhoea. SCM occurred in 14% of women and was associated with increased odds of infant stunting (odds ratio [OR] = 4.3; confidence interval [CI] [1.1, 15.8]), underweight (OR = 9.2; CI [1.8, 48.0]), and low head circumference (OR = 15.9; CI [2.6, 96.9]).

Poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions are the primary routes of exposure and infection. Sanitation and hygiene interventions are estimated to generate a 36% and 48% reduction in diarrheal risk in young children, respectively. Little is known about whether the number of households sharing a sanitation facility affects a child's risk of diarrhea. The objective of this study was to describe sanitation and hygiene access across the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) sites in Africa and South Asia and to assess sanitation and hygiene exposures, including shared sanitation access, as risk factors for moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children less than 5 y of age.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/findings:\n        \n      \n      The GEMS matched case-control study was conducted between December 1, 2007, and March 3, 2011, at seven sites in Basse, The Gambia; Nyanza Province, Kenya; Bamako, Mali; Manhiça, Mozambique; Mirzapur, Bangladesh; Kolkata, India; and Karachi, Pakistan. Data was collected for 8,592 case children aged <5 y old experiencing MSD and for 12,390 asymptomatic age, gender, and neighborhood-matched controls. An MSD case was defined as a child with a diarrheal illness <7 d duration comprising ≥3 loose stools in 24 h and ≥1 of the following: sunken eyes, skin tenting, dysentery, intravenous (IV) rehydration, or hospitalization. Site-specific conditional logistic regression models were used to explore the association between sanitation and hygiene exposures and MSD. Most households at six sites (>93%) had access to a sanitation facility, while 70% of households in rural Kenya had access to a facility. Practicing open defecation was a risk factor for MSD in children <5 y old in Kenya. Sharing sanitation facilities with 1-2 or ≥3 other households was a statistically significant risk factor for MSD in Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, and Pakistan. Among those with a designated handwashing area near the home, soap or ash were more frequently observed at control households and were significantly protective against MSD in Mozambique and India.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study suggests that sharing a sanitation facility with just one to two other households can increase the risk of MSD in young children, compared to using a private facility. Interventions aimed at increasing access to private household sanitation facilities may reduce the burden of MSD in children.

One strategy for improving sanitation access is community-led total sanitation (CLTS), in which participants are guided into self-realization of the importance of sanitation through activities called \"triggering.\" This qualitative study explored community members' and stakeholders' sanitation, knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors during early CLTS implementation in Zambia. We conducted 67 in-depth interviews and 24 focus group discussions in six districts in Zambia 12-18 months after CLTS implementation. Triggering activities elicited strong emotions, including shame, disgust, and peer pressure, which persuaded individuals and families to build and use latrines and handwashing stations. New sanitation behaviors were also encouraged by the hierarchical influences of traditional leaders and sanitation action groups and by children's opinions. Poor soil conditions were identified as barriers to latrine construction. Taboos, including prohibition of different generations of family members, in-laws, and opposite genders from using the same toilet, were barriers for using sanitation facilities. CLTS, through community empowerment and ownership, produced powerful responses that encouraged construction and use of latrines and handwashing practices. These qualitative data suggest that CLTS is effective for improving sanitation beliefs and behaviors in Zambia."

This review analyzes the nutrition situation in Jordan by exploring specific nutrition indicators, namely infant and young child feeding, low birthweight, micronutrient deficiencies, anthropometric indicators, and food consumption patterns. Results showed that although most children were ever breastfed and early initiation of breastfeeding had a two-fold increasing trend, rates of exclusive breastfeeding below 6 months of age and continued breastfeeding until two years of age were low. Complementary feeding indicators, particularly minimum diet diversity and minimum acceptable diet standards, were suboptimal. An overall low burden of stunting, wasting, and underweight among children under 5 years and remarkable progress in optimizing iodine status among school-aged children were reported. Conversely, the burden of low birthweight and overweight/obesity exacerbated, coexisting with anemia, vitamin A deficiency, and vitamin D deficiency. Overall, fruit and vegetable consumption were inadequate. The consumption of soft drinks and salt on the other hand was higher than recommended. This review acknowledges the double burden of malnutrition in Jordan and recommends the prioritization and evaluation of interventions towards improving the population's nutritional status and achieving nutrition targets."

Eligible studies quantified (1) household-level faecal indicator bacteria concentrations along common faecal-oral transmission pathways of drinking water, soil, or food, on children's hands or fomites, or fly densities in food preparation areas; and (2) individual-level diarrhoea or linear growth measures for children younger than 5 years in low-income and middle-income countries. For the diarrhoea analysis, all definitions of diarrhoea were eligible but studies were excluded if they used a recall period longer than 7 days. For the linear growth analysis (using height-for-age Z scores [HAZ]), cross-sectional studies were excluded, because of the absence of longitudinal environmental contamination data measured before the growth outcomes. We used multilevel generalised mixed-effects models to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for diarrhoea and the difference in HAZ scores for individual studies associated with a 1-log10 higher measure of faecal contamination. Estimates from each study were combined under a random-effects meta-analysis framework.

A stratified random sample of households and resident children <2 y old from villages exposed to the program were enrolled in the study. Main outcome measures included principal determinants of undernutrition and childhood stunting, which was defined as a height-for-age z score less than -2. National trends in stunting were generated from demographic and health surveys.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Three years after the start of the program in 2005-2006, consistent improvements were observed in household food security and diet diversity, whereas coverage with child care and disease-control interventions improved for most outcomes. The prevalence of stunting in children <2 y old at year 3 of the program (2008-2009) was 43% lower (adjusted OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.83) than at baseline. The average national stunting prevalence for the countries included in the study had remained largely unchanged over the past 2 decades.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings provide encouraging evidence that a package of multisector interventions has the potential to produce reductions in childhood stunting."

            "abstract": "Low Birth Weight (LBW) is considered as a major public health issue and leading cause of neonatal death. Almost one in four newborns are reported as underweight in Pakistan. Children born with low birth weight are highly vulnerable to develop diseases and death and/or remain undernourished (i.e., stunted and wasted). This study determines the LBW newborns are more prone to develop stunting and wasting in province of Sindh, Pakistan. Moreover, regression-based estimation of the impact of LBW on the child health outcomes of under five years of age, may be prone to selection bias because of the nature of non-experimental data set, thus, propensity score matching methods are used in this study. Data for this study was used from Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS-2014). MICS is a two-stage, stratified cluster sampling household level data covering urban and rural areas and consists of 19,500 households from five administrative divisions and 28 districts of Sindh province of Pakistan. The total sample size of children less than five years of age after cleaning the data are 7781, of which 2095 are LBW having birth weight categorized as \"smaller than average and very small\" and 5686 are normal birth weight (NBW) having birth weight very large, larger than average, and average. This study employed propensity score matching (PSM) regression methods to understand whether the children born as low birth weight are more prone to stunting and wasting and/or both. In province of Sindh, moderate wasting children under five years were 21%, severe wasting 6% and both wasting and stunting 10%. The propensity score results are shown significant in all groups. Specifically, all four types of PSM methods confirm a significant difference in the potential outcome variables-meaning that a child born with LBW has a significant adverse effect on the potential child health outcome variables (stunting, wasting and both). Thus, the propensity score matching findings confirm a significant and adverse effect of LBW on potential health outcomes of under five children. Similarly, low birth weight children are significantly more likely to be moderately wasted (OR = 1.5, CI = 1.3-1.6) and severely wasted (OR = 1.6, CI = 1.3-2.0) and both (stunted and wasted, OR = 2.0, CI = 1.7-2.3) as compared to children with normal birth weight. Male children, if born with low birth weight, are significantly more likely to be moderately wasted (OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1-1.5) and both (wasted and stunted, OR = 1.3, CI = 1.1-1.5) than girls. This large data analysis finding proved that the LBW newborns are on higher risk to develop wasting and stunting in Pakistan."

This study aimed to evaluate the association of NTS infection with growth faltering among children under the age of five. We analyzed data from 378 fecal NTS positive children with both moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) and asymptomatic infection from the seven countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa during enrolment and on day 60 follow up in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) for the period of December 2007 to March 2011. Children not associated with fecal NTS (n = 1134) were randomly selected from the same dataset (1:3 ratio) as a comparison group. The association between an explanatory variable and the outcome variable was longitudinally tested using generalized estimating equations (GEE), where the dependent variables were height-for-age (HAZ), weight-for-age (WAZ), and weight-for-height (WHZ) z-score, and the independent variable was the presence of fecal NTS. The GEE multivariable model identified a negative association between fecal NTS and WAZ (coefficient: -0.19; 95% CI (confidence interval): -0.33, -0.04, and p value = 0.010), WHZ (coef: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.34, -0.05, and p value = 0.007), and HAZ (coef: -0.13; 95% CI: -0.27, -0.01, and p value = 0.073) after adjusting for age, gender, diarrhea, breastfeeding status, mothers' education, number of children under the age of five, household size by the number of people regularly sleep at the home, handwashing practice, source of drinking water, wealth index, presence of co-pathogens, comorbidity, and study sites. In the GEMS, where children were followed during 50-90 days of enrolment, the presence of fecal NTS harmed the child's anthropometric outcomes. Minimizing potential exposure to NTS is needed to curb worsening child undernutrition."

Few WinS evaluations rigorously report on output and outcome measures that allow for comparisons of effectiveness between interventions to be made, or for an understanding of why programs succeed. The Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene for Health and Education in Laotian Primary Schools (WASH HELPS) study was a randomized controlled trial designed to measure the impact of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Laos WinS project on child health and education. We also measured the sustainability of intervention outputs and outcomes, and analyzed the effectiveness of group hygiene activities on behavior change and habit formation. Here, we present the design and intermediate results from this study. We found the WinS project improved the WASH environment in intervention schools; 87.8% of schools received the intervention per design. School-level adherence to outputs was lower; on average, schools met 61.4% of adherence-related criteria. The WinS project produced positive changes in pupils' school WASH behaviors, specifically increasing toilet use and daily group handwashing. Daily group hygiene activities are effective strategies to improve school WASH behaviors, but a complementary strategy needs to be concurrently promoted for effective and sustained individual handwashing practice at critical times."

However, there remains complexity in their association. This study evaluates the association between stunting, underweight, wasting, and malaria among under-five Nigerian children while assessing the effects of sociodemographic factors. Cross-sectional data from the 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey were used, which included a study population of 12,996 children aged 0-59 months. Stunting (HAZ<-2.0 SD), underweight (WAZ<-2.0 SD), wasting (WHZ<-2.0 SD), malaria test results, and sociodemographic factors were obtained and examined. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the associations between undernutrition, malaria, and sociodemographic factors. The prevalence of stunting was 37.0%, with 22.0% underweight, 6.9% wasting, and 22.6% tested positive for malaria. Stunting was frequent among 24-35 months old, 12-23 months old were mostly underweight and wasted, and 48-59 months old frequently suffered from malaria. Undernutrition and malaria frequently occurred among males, residents of rural areas, the poorest wealth quintile, and children of mothers with no formal education. The odds of having malaria was 89% higher among under-five stunted children (AOR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.00,1.40; p-value = <0.0001). However, underweight (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.91,1.36; p-value = 0.2982) and wasting (AOR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.67,1.19; p-value = 0.4519) were not significantly associated with malaria. The development of appropriate strategies, especially in rural areas and for less-educated mothers are critical to combat undernutrition and malaria."

We evaluated the benefits of a behavior change communication method to motivate water treatment practices in urban low income communities in Dhaka, Bangladesh. To motivate people to chlorinate their water we used a device called the 'Disgust Box'. This box provides a vivid demonstration of how piped water is contaminated with feces. Most of the respondents were able to recall the Disgust Box demonstration at both 4-month and 1-year follow-up qualitative assessments. At 4 months, the majority of participants stated that they still felt disgusted by the demonstration and mentioned it as a motivator for water chlorination. However, after one year, despite being able to recall the demonstration, disgust was no longer mentioned as a motivator to chlorinate water. The Disgust Box has the potential to be an effective communication method and is more likely to work if it is part of an intervention that includes repeated presentations and a more attractive water treatment option."

Studies linking water, sanitation, and hygiene, nutrition, and child growth and development have emphasised the optimisation of linear growth as a key metric for the evaluation of intervention efficacy. Life history characteristics pertaining to human growth and phenotypic plasticity, suggest that different developmental outcomes in early childhood may be responsive to different stimuli at different ages. Energy utilisation by the human brain, from birth through childhood, accounts for a disproportionate percentage of the resting metabolic rate. Undernutrition in early life, and its relative resultant energy deficiency, may trigger adaptive physiological mechanisms prioritising brain growth at the expense of body growth. Emphasis placed on linear growth may have impeded the significance of WASH due to excluding aspects of child development beyond height/weight. We propose that incorporating evolutionary public health and life history theory perspectives, allows for the identification of age-appropriate biological outcomes and WASH indicators, while anticipating the timing and life-course suitability of the interventions being operationalised. Finally, integrating reflections regarding context allows for the development of transformative WASH interventions."

Mother-child pairs from 310 households in four villages of Monduli and Longido were involved. Weight and height of children were measured using weighing scale and length/height board, respectively. Children's age was recorded using clinic cards. Hemoglobin level of each child was tested using Hemo Cue® Hb 201 + photometer (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden) machine. Structured questionnaire was used to gather information on WASH, child morbidity, demographic, and sociocultural characteristics. Prevalence of stunted, underweight, wasted, anemia, and diarrhea were 31.6%, 15.5%, 4.5% 61.2%, and 15.5%, respectively. Children with diarrhea 2 weeks preceding the survey (P = 0.004), children using surface water for domestic purposes (P < 0.001), and those with uneducated mothers (P = 0.001) had increased risk of being stunted and underweight.

The HR for mortality in WaSt was 9.5 (95% CI, 5.9-15), but 60% of WaSt-associated mortality occurred at 3-6 months. Wasting or WaSt was associated with 10-23% of deaths beyond 6 months, but in the second year over half of deaths occurred in stunted, nonwasted children. Stunting persisted in 82% of children and wasting persisted in 44%. Wasted children were more likely than nonwasted, nonstunted children to become stunted (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.7-2.2), but 94% of children who progressed to stunting had not been wasted in the prior period.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      WaSt greatly increased the risk of death, particularly in very young infants, but more deaths overall were associated with stunting. Most stunting appeared to be either intrauterine in origin or arose in children without prior wasting. Either stunting and wasting represent alternative responses to restricted nutrition, or stunting also has other, nonnutritional causes."

            "abstract": "Infectious diseases and especially diarrheal diseases have been noted to have an adverse effect on the growth of underprivileged children in developing countries. Diarrheal diseases have been estimated to account for 10-80% of growth retardation in the first few years of life, with the magnitude of effect possibly modified by other factors, such as the adequacy and source of dietary intake, treatment and feeding practices during and following illness and the opportunity for catch-up growth after illness. In the only study in which infectious diseases and routine dietary intake have been evaluated simultaneously, inadequate dietary intake rather than infectious diseases, was found to have the predominant role in growth faltering. Although reduction in infectious diseases is desirable for many reasons, the relative feasibility and cost of this approach to improve nutritional status must be compared with more direct nutrition interventions."

Each child with diarrhoea was given oral rehydration or, in the severe cases, intravenous rehydration. Each subject was checked for enteropathogens and his or her weight, height and weight-for-height, weight-for-age and height-for-age Z-scores were evaluated immediately after any clinical dehydration had been corrected and 30 days later. In the infants aged <6 months, a diet that included foods other than breast milk (odds ratio=9.41), including one in which breast milk was supplemented with other foods (odds ratio=4.69), was found to be statistically associated with diarrhoea. The enteropathogens found most commonly in the children with diarrhoea were rotavirus (36.9%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (11.6%) and Shigella (11.6%). Just four (5.2%) of the 77 cases with adequate follow-up showed persistent diarrhoea. At presentation or as soon as any clinical dehydration had been corrected, the infants with diarrhoea had significantly lower weights and weight-for-height and weight-for-age Z-scores than the controls. Thirty days later, however, the weight-for-height and weight-for-age Z-scores of the cases had increased significantly, to the point when they were not significantly different from the baseline values for the controls. The negative consequences of diarrhoea on weight-for-height and weight-for-age Z-scores and the recovery of these parameters after 30 days with rehydration reflect the acute but reversible influence of diarrhoea on infant nutritional status."

We assessed motor milestone (MM) achievement using the World Health Organization's windows of achievement for gross motor milestones. We performed secondary analysis of baseline data of 158 Vietnamese children aged 5-18 months from a randomized community intervention trial. Median age of motor milestone achievement was compared to WHO reported medians. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify socioeconomic, anthropometric and dietary factors associated with motor milestone achievement during the windows of achievement. Thirty four per cent of the children were stunted. Median age of MM achievement of Vietnamese children lagged by 2.4-3.7 months, compared to the WHO median for all MMs. Greater length-for-age increased the odds for walking with assistance, standing alone and walking alone by more than 3 times. Greater weight-for-age increased the odds by 3.6 for hand-and-knees crawling. Likewise, frequency of daily complementary feeding raised the odds by 3.6 for standing with assistance. In this first application of WHO windows of achievement in Viet Nam, pre-schoolers achieved motor milestones later than WHO reported median age. High prevalence of stunting and association of length-for-age with motor milestone achievement underscore the importance of addressing chronic malnutrition to optimize children's growth and development."

We formulate and analyse a deterministic compartmental model using nonlinear differential equations. The basic reproduction number is obtained and both disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are shown to be asymptotically stable under given threshold conditions. The model may exhibit backward bifurcation for some parameter values, and the sensitivity indices of the basic reproduction number with respect to the parameters are determined. We extend the model to include control measures for eradication of the infection from the community. Pontryagian's maximum principle is used to formulate the optimal control problem using three control strategies, namely, health education through provision of educational materials, educational messages to improve the awareness of the susceptible population, and treatment by mass drug administration that target the entire population(preschool- and school-aged children) and sanitation through provision of clean water and personal hygiene. Numerical simulations were done using MATLAB and graphical results are displayed. The cost effectiveness of the control measures were done using incremental cost-effective ratio, and results reveal that the combination of health education and sanitation is the best strategy to combat the helminth infection. Therefore, in order to completely eradicate soil-transmitted helminths, we advise investment efforts on health education and sanitation controls."

For similar analyses, no significant associations were found for child stunting, and more moderate effects were observed in the case of child underweight.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Particularly in low-resource or subsistence-farming rural settings, long-lasting nutritional response in the aftermath of floods should be seriously considered to counteract the long-term nutritional effects on children, particularly infants, and include their mothers on whom they are dependent. The systematic monitoring of nutritional status in these groups might help to tailor efficient responses in each particular context."

            "abstract": "District-representative data are rarely collected in the surveys for identifying localised disparities in Bangladesh, and so district-level estimates of undernutrition indicators - stunting, wasting and underweight - have remained largely unexplored. This study aims to estimate district-level prevalence of these indicators by employing a multivariate Fay-Herriot (MFH) model which accounts for the underlying correlation among the undernutrition indicators. Direct estimates (DIR) of the target indicators and their variance-covariance matrices calculated from the 2019 Bangladesh Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey microdata have been used as input for developing univariate Fay-Herriot (UFH), bivariate Fay-Herriot (BFH) and MFH models. The comparison of the various model-based estimates and their relative standard errors with the corresponding direct estimates reveals that the MFH estimator provides unbiased estimates with more accuracy than the DIR, UFH and BFH estimators. The MFH model-based district level estimates of stunting, wasting and underweight range between 16 and 43%, 15 and 36%, and 6 and 13% respectively. District level bivariate maps of undernutrition indicators show that districts in north-eastern and south-eastern parts are highly exposed to either form of undernutrition, than the districts in south-western and central parts of the country. In terms of the number of undernourished children, millions of children affected by either form of undernutrition are living in densely populated districts like the capital district Dhaka, though undernutrition indicators (as a proportion) are comparatively lower. These findings can be used to target districts with a concurrence of multiple forms of undernutrition, and in the design of urgent intervention programs to reduce the inequality in child undernutrition at the localised district level."

            "abstract": "We analyse data from the 2012 Comprehensive Nutrition Survey in the State of Maharashtra, India, which surveyed 2,630 households. This is a unique dataset because in addition to nutritional status of mothers and children, it has information on diets of women and children and household food security. This rich dataset allows us to address three issues: whether household food security predicts higher diet diversity in children aged 6-23 months; whether household food security predicts lower risk of undernutrition; and whether the lower risk of undernutrition in children who live in food secure households is mediated by improved diet diversity for children. We find that children from moderately food insecure and severely food insecure households are more likely to have lower diet diversity scores. We find that the odds of a child being severely stunted, severely underweight, or severely wasted are higher in severely food insecure households. After controlling for children's diet diversity, and other child, maternal and household characteristics, we find that household food security is no longer statistically associated with stunting, wasting, or underweight. However, diet diversity of children is statistically significantly associated with whether a child is stunted or underweight. Our results although not causal provide evidence for understanding the extent to which household food insecurity affects children's diet diversity and how both these factors affect nutrition outcomes in children. Our analysis informs Government of Maharashtra's and India's National Nutrition Mission in their efforts for formulating appropriate policies and programmes to address child undernutrition."

A study on perceptions and practices related to schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections was undertaken among a community population of Kome Island in Sengerema District, north-western Tanzania, where intestinal schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections are endemic. Schistosomiasis and intestinal worm-related perceptions and practices were assessed before and 3 years after implementation of a participatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) intervention as a control measure. Data were obtained from baseline and post-intervention knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) questionnaire surveys conducted twice in 2009 and 2012 among 82 individuals aged ≥15 years. We found significant increases in respondents' knowledge of the cause, transmission, symptoms, health consequences, and prevention of schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections after PHAST intervention. The increase in respondents' knowledge on almost all aspects of the said infections was translated into actions to control schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections. This has not been achieved by chance, but due to well-designed and locally-adapted PHAST intervention. We conclude that despite criticisms, PHAST approach is still useful in empowering communities to control water, sanitation, and hygiene related infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis and intestinal worm infections."

We implemented an integrated home-environmental intervention package (IHIP), comprising a kitchen sink, hygiene education and a certified improved biomass cookstove, and an early child development (ECD) programme to improve children´s health and developmental outcomes in the rural high-altitude Andes of Peru.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a one-year cluster-randomised controlled trial among 317 children < 36 months divided into 4 arms (IHIP + ECD, IHIP, ECD, and Control) and 40 clusters (10 clusters per arm). ECD status (socio-emotional, fine and gross motor, communication, cognitive skills, and an overall performance) measured with the Peruvian Infant Development Scale and the occurrence of self-reported child diarrhoea from caretakers were primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the occurrence of acute respiratory infections and the presence of thermo-tolerant faecal bacteria in drinking water. The trial was powered to compare each intervention against its control arm but it did not allow pairwise comparisons among the four arms. Primary analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle.

However, there is growing evidence of the harmful health effects of proximity of animals to infants and young children, especially through exposure to zoonotic pathogens. Poultry ownership is almost universal in rural Burkina Faso. Poultry feces are a significant risk factor for enteric diseases that are associated with child undernutrition. To investigate the extent of exposure to livestock feces among young children and caregivers, we conducted direct observations of 20 caregiver-child dyads for a total of 80 hours (4 hours per dyad) and recorded water quality, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH)-related behaviors. We also undertook in-depth interviews with these caregivers and focus group discussions with separate groups of men and women who were poultry farmers. Poultry and other livestock feces were visible in all 20 and 19 households, respectively, in both kitchen areas and in the household courtyards where children frequently sit or crawl. Direct soil ingestion by young children was observed in almost half of the households (45%). Poor handwashing practices were also common among caregivers and children. Although latrines were available in almost all households, child feces disposal practices were inadequate. This body of research suggests an urgent need to adapt conventional WASH and livestock interventions to reduce the exposure of infants and young children to livestock feces."

Current control methods use preventative chemotherapy but reinfection is common and an inter-sectoral approach is required if elimination is to be achieved. Household and community scale water treatment can be used to provide a safe alternative water supply for contact activities, reducing exposure to WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) -related helminths. With the introduction of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-C LEDs), ultraviolet (UV) disinfection could be a realistic option for water treatment in low-income regions in the near future, to provide safe alternative water supplies for drinking and contact activities such as handwashing, bathing, and laundry, but currently there is no guidance for the use of UV or solar disinfection against helminths.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative systematic review of existing literature was carried out to establish which WASH-related helminths are more susceptible to UV disinfection and identify gaps in research to inform future studies.

Poor infant and young child feeding practices have been identified as the main causes for undernutrition. As dietary diversity is a major requirement if children are to get all essential nutrients, it can thus be used as one of the core indicators when assessing feeding practices and nutrition of children. Therefore, adequate information on the association between dietary diversity and undernutrition to identify potential strategies for the prevention of undernutrition is critical. Here we examined to what extent dietary diversity is associated with undernutrition among children of 6 to 23 months in Tanzania.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using existing data from the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey of 2015-2016, we carried out secondary data analysis.

A composite dietary diversity score was created by summing the number of food groups eaten the previous day as reported for each child by the mother ranging from 0 to 7. Then, minimum dietary diversity (MDD) of 4 food groups out of seven was used to assess the diversity of the diet given to children.

Mortality and short-term morbidity cause substantial burden of disease but probably underestimate the true effect of diarrhoea on population health. This underestimation is because diarrhoeal diseases can negatively affect early childhood growth, probably through enteric dysfunction and impaired uptake of macronutrients and micronutrients. We attempt to quantify the long-term sequelae associated with childhood growth impairment due to diarrhoea.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study framework and leveraged existing estimates of diarrhoea incidence, childhood undernutrition, and infectious disease burden to estimate the effect of diarrhoeal diseases on physical growth, including weight and height, and subsequent disease among children younger than 5 years. The burden of diarrhoea was measured in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), a composite metric of mortality and morbidity. We hypothesised that diarrhoea is negatively associated with three common markers of growth: weight-for-age, weight-for-height, and height-for-age Z-scores. On the basis of these undernutrition exposures, we applied a counterfactual approach to quantify the relative risk of infectious disease (subsequent diarrhoea, lower respiratory infection, and measles) and protein energy malnutrition morbidity and mortality per day of diarrhoea and quantified the burden of diarrhoeal disease due to these outcomes caused by undernutrition.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Diarrhoea episodes are significantly associated with childhood growth faltering. We found that each day of diarrhoea was associated with height-for-age Z-score (-0·0033 [95% CI -0·0024 to -0·0041]; p=4·43 × 10-14), weight-for-age Z-score (-0·0077 [-0·0058 to -0·0097]; p=3·19 × 10-15), and weight-for-height Z-score (-0·0096 [-0·0067 to -0·0125]; p=7·78 × 10-11). After addition of the DALYs due to the long-term sequelae as a consequence of undernutrition, the burden of diarrhoeal diseases increased by 39·0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 33·0-46·6) and was responsible for 55 778 000 DALYs (95% UI 49 125 400-62 396 200) among children younger than 5 years in 2016. Among the 15 652 300 DALYs (95% UI 12 951 300-18 806 100) associated with undernutrition due to diarrhoeal episodes, more than 84·7% are due to increased risk of infectious disease, whereas the remaining 15·3% of long-term DALYs are due to increased prevalence of protein energy malnutrition. The burden of diarrhoea has decreased substantially since 1990, but progress has been greater in long-term (78·7% reduction [95% UI 69·3-85·5]) than in acute (70·4% reduction [95% UI 61·7-76·5]) DALYs.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Diarrhoea represents an even larger burden of disease than was estimated in the Global Burden of Disease Study.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Hand hygiene in refugee camp settlements remains an important measure against diarrhoeal infections. Refugee settings are characterised by overcrowding and inadequate access to water and hygiene facilities which favour proliferation of faecal-oral diseases. Handwashing with soap and water is therefore an effective way of preventing such diseases. Despite this knowledge, there is limited information about access to functional handwashing facilities in these settings and associated factors in Uganda.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Quantitative data were collected from 312 refugee households in Rhino Camp Settlement, Northwestern Uganda, using a semistructured interviewer-administered questionnaire. A modified Poisson regression was used to obtain prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the determinants of access to a functional handwashing facility among refugee households. All analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 statistical software.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 312 households, 123 (39.4%) had access to a handwashing facility, but only 72 (23.1%) of households had handwashing facilities that were functional. Duration of stay in the camp exceeding 3 years (adjusted PR = 2.63; 95% CI (1.73-4.00)) and history of receiving home-based education on hand hygiene (adjusted PR = 9.44; 95% CI (1.40-63.86)) were independent predictors of access to a functional handwashing facility.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Access to functional handwashing facilities among the refugee households was low. Our findings highlight the need for more and continued handwashing promotional programs, most especially among newly arrived refugees in the camp."

The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors associated with intestinal parasitic infections, anaemia, and malnutrition in school children, living in urban and rural areas of northern Ethiopia. Six hundred school children, aged 6-15 years, were randomly selected in a cross-sectional survey from 12 primary schools. Sociodemographic and anthropometric data were collected. Faecal samples were examined using direct, concentration, and the Kato-Katz methods. Urine specimens were analysed for Schistosoma haematobium ova. Haemoglobin was measured using a HemoCue spectrometer. The overall prevalence of intestinal parasitosis was 72% (95% confidence interval (CI): 66-76%). The prevalence of anaemia, stunting, and thinness were 11% (95% CI: 8-13%), 35% (95% CI: 31-38%), and 34% (95% CI: 30-38%), respectively. Poor personal hygiene habits were generally associated with anaemia and nutritional deficiency (low body mass index). Multivariate logistic regression models related Schistosoma mansoni infection with boys. Boys were also more likely to be malnourished. Hookworm infection was associated with anaemia and unhygienic finger nails. Access to clean water and latrines, with some hygiene and sanitation communication activities, could improve health of children in Ethiopia. The use of smartphone technology in demographic data collection proved to be successful. The potential advantage offered by this technology for parasitological field surveys merits further investigation."

We examined the relationship between weight-for-height and linear growth in 127 stunted Jamaican children aged 9-24 months. The children were measured every 6 months over a 2-year period. The initial weight-for-height status was positively associated with linear growth in the following 6-month interval. The change in weight-for-height in the preceding interval was a better predictor of linear growth in the next interval than attained weight-for-height at the beginning of the interval. The results suggest that variations in weight-for-height may influence the rate of linear growth."

            "abstract": "The management of wasting in Ethiopia is heavily reliant on the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programme that has been implemented in more than 18,000 service delivery points scattered across the country. Despite the full-scale implementation of the CMAM, the number of child death averted, and the cost per child death averted remains unknown. This study aimed to estimate the cost and the number of child death averted by the CMAM programme between 2008 and 2020. Using data from routine monitoring of the CMAM programme, we estimated the excess mortality averted by the programme and estimated the cost per averted child death based on supply and labour. Over the past 13 years between 2008 and 2020, 3.6 million children under 5 years were admitted to the Ethiopian CMAM programme. The yearly average admission of 317,228 was achieved since 2011. On average, ~34,000 child deaths were averted yearly. The CMAM programme was estimated to have saved 437,654 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 320,161; 469,932) child deaths between 2008 and 2020, approximately 12% of the admitted cases. The average cost of the programme per adverted death was estimated at US$762/child death averted (95% CI = 639; 1001). The CMAM programme in Ethiopia is cost-effective and has continued to avert a significant number of child death. Given the high short- and long-term economic and health consequences of child wasting, concerted multi-sectoral efforts are needed to accelerate progress not only in its treatment but also in its prevention."

Nevertheless, over the past 20 years, Nepal sustained one of the most rapid reductions in the prevalence of stunting worldwide. First, our study analysed the trends in height-for-age z-score (HAZ), stunting prevalence, and available nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific determinants of linear growth faltering in under-three children across Nepal's Family Health Survey 1996 and Nepal's Demographic and Health Surveys 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016. Second, we constructed pooled multivariable linear regression models and decomposed the contributions of our time-variant determinants on the predicted changes in HAZ and stunting over the past two decades. Our findings indicate substantial improvements in HAZ (38.5%) and reductions in stunting (-42.6%) and severe stunting prevalence (-63.9%) in Nepalese children aged 0-35 months. We also report that the increment in HAZ, across the 1996-2016 period, was significantly associated (confounder-adjusted p < .05) with household asset index, maternal and paternal years of education, maternal body mass index and height, basic child vaccinations, preceding birth interval, childbirth in a medical facility, and prenatal doctor visits. Furthermore, our quantitative decomposition of HAZ identified advances in utilisation of health care and related services (31.7% of predicted change), household wealth accumulation (25%), parental education (21.7%), and maternal nutrition (8.3%) as key drivers of the long-term and sustained progress against child linear growth deficits. Our research reiterates the multifactorial nature of chronic child undernutrition and the need for coherent multisectoral nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific strategies at national scale to further improve linear growth in Nepal.

We evaluated the association between the risk of drinking water and bacterial carrier status in children younger than 5 years in a cross-sectional study conducted in 199 households from three Peruvian rural communities. Fecal samples from children were screened for pathogenic Aeromonas, Campylobacter, and Vibrio species, as well as for Enterobacteriaceae, including pathogenic Escherichia coli. The drinking water risk was determined using E. coli as an indicator of contamination. Nineteen (9.5%) children were colonized with pathogens and classified as carriers, all without diarrhea symptoms. Of 199 drinking water samples, 38 (19.1%) were classified as very high risk because of high fecal contamination (> 100 E. coli/100 mL). Shared-use water sources, daily washing of containers, and washing using only water were associated with higher prevalence of bacterial carriage, whereas there was no association between households reporting boiling and chlorination of water and carrier status. The prevalence of carriage in children exposed to very high-risk water was 2.82 (95% CI: 1.21-6.59) times the prevalence of those who consumed less contaminated water, adjusted by the water source and daily washing. Our results suggest that household drinking water plays an important role in the generation of carriers with diarrheal pathogens. Our findings also highlight the importance of interventions to ensure the safety of drinking water. Further studies are needed to validate the observed association and determine its significance with respect to diarrhea in the community."

Children were considered underweight, stunting and wasting following the NCHS standards. Overall the prevalence of underweight, stunting and wasting was 33.9%, 26.1% and 19.4 %, respectively. Of these, 9.1%, 9.7% and 3.6% children were found to be severely underweight, stunted and wasted. Moreover, the prevalence of underweight and stunting was significantly higher in pre-school children compared to school going children. There is an urgent need for appropriate steps to be taken to improve nutritional status of children in this ethnic group."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Systematically collected and comparable data on drinking water safety at city-scale is currently unavailable, despite the stated importance of water safety monitoring at scale under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We developed a rapid drinking water quality assessment methodology intended to be replicable across all cities and useful for monitoring towards achieving SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We collected drinking water samples at the point-of-consumption for basic microbial, physical and chemical water quality analysis and conducted household surveys on drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene access from 80 households in the city of Cochabamba over 1 week. We categorized the household's water service level according to the SDG 6 framework.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We estimated an average time requirement of 6.4 person-hours and a consumable cost of US $51 per household (n = 80). In this cross-sectional study, 71% of drinking water samples met World Health Organization (WHO) microbiological safety criteria, 96% met WHO chemical quality criteria, and all met WHO aesthetic quality criteria. However, only 18% of the households were categorized as having safely managed drinking water services. None met the criteria for having safely managed sanitation services; nonetheless, 81% had basic sanitation services and 78% had basic hygiene facilities.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This method can generate basic water safety data for a city at a relatively low cost in terms of person-time and materials, yielding useful information for inter-city analyses. Because 29% of samples did not meet microbiological safety criteria, 22% of the households did not have access to handwashing facilities and none had safe sanitation services, we concluded that Cochabamba did not meet normative SDG 6 targets when surveyed. Our study further suggests that water quality at point-of-use more accurately characterizes drinking water safety than infrastructure type."

Both biological and socioeconomic factors contribute to undernutrition, and the literature reports an association between women's empowerment and lower rates of child undernutrition in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the relationship between women's decision-making power and child undernutrition is less understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between women's decision-making power and stunting/wasting in their children under age five in the DRC. This study used cross-sectional data from the 2013-2014 DRC Demographic and Health Survey, from which a sample of 3,721 woman-child pairs were identified. Women were classified as having decision-making power in five decision-making dimensions if they participated in the decision either alone or jointly with their husband or partner or someone else. Child height-for-age and weight-for-height Z-scores were used to determine stunting and wasting, respectively, according to the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards. Multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that none of the five dimensions of decision-making power were associated with stunting or wasting in children. Further research that evaluates women's decision-making power with more detailed, relevant and context-specific measures is warranted to more accurately investigate women's decision-making power and undernutrition in children."

We assessed the performance of the filters by conducting a five-month randomized controlled trial among all 60 households in the pilot community. Water filters eliminated thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms from almost all intervention households and significantly reduced turbidity, thereby improving water aesthetics. Most importantly, the filters were associated with a 45.3% reduction in prevalence of diarrhoea among the study population (p = 0.02). After adjustment for household clustering and repeated episodes in individuals and controlling for age and baseline diarrhoea, prevalence of diarrhoea among the intervention group was 51% lower than controls, though the protective effect was only borderline significant (OR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.24, 1.01; p = 0.05). A follow-up survey conducted approximately 9 months after deployment of the filters found 67% being used regularly, 13% being used intermittently, and 21% not in use.

A clinic-based case-control design was used to investigate the impact of improved sanitation on diarrhoea morbidity in young children. The results indicate that under-5-year-olds from households with a latrine may experience 24% fewer episodes of diarrhoea than such children from households without a latrine (odds ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.01). The impact of latrines on diarrhoea was greater in those households that used more water, practised better personal hygiene, and where the mothers had a higher level of education or worked outside the home. In common with studies conducted in Malawi, Philippines, and Sri Lanka, little evidence was found that the relationship between latrine ownership and diarrhoea was confounded by socioeconomic status or environmental variables. For a sample of cases and controls, data on exposure status (presence or absence of a latrine) that were collected by interview at the clinics agreed closely with those obtained by observation during a home visit."

The World Health Organization South-East Asia Region has made considerable progress in WASH provision during the past two decades. However, compared with increases in coverage of improved drinking water, in some parts of the region, access to adequate sanitation remains low, with continued prevalence of open defecation. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have set ambitious targets for WASH services to be achieved by 2030. Examples of major health outcomes that would benefit from meeting these targets are diarrhoea and nutrition status. Although the total number of deaths attributable to diarrhoea declined substantially between 1990 and 2012, inadequate WASH still accounts for more than 1000 child deaths each day worldwide. And, despite the reductions in mortality, diarrhoea morbidity attributable to diarrhoea remains unchanged at around 1.7 billion cases per year. It has been known for decades that repeated episodes of diarrhoea increase a child's risk of long-term undernutrition, reduced growth and impaired cognitive development. Nutritional effects of inadequate WASH also include environmental enteropathy, leading to chronic intestinal inflammation, malnutrition and developmental deficits in young children. Inadequate WASH also contributes to iron deficiency anaemia resulting from infestation with soil-transmitted helminths. The cross-sectoral emphasis of the SDGs should act as a stimulus for intersectoral collaboration on research and interventions to reduce all inequities that result from inadequate WASH."

The nutritional status of women was examined through Body-Mass Index (Underweight, normal, overweight, & obese), and that of children was examined through stunting (severe and moderate), wasting (severe, moderate, overweight), and underweight (severe, moderate, overweight). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis have been used along with multinomial logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A higher proportion of children in rural areas were severely stunted (19.6% vs. 12.5%), severe wasted (2.4% vs. 2.2%), and severe underweight (9.4% vs. 6%) than their urban counterparts. A higher proportion of rural women (9.5% vs. 5.5%) were underweight than urban women, whereas a higher proportion of urban women were obese (24.3% vs. 19.0%) than rural women. The odds of severe stunting (OR = 0.24; C.I. = 0.15-0.37), severe underweight (OR = 0.11; C.I. = 0.05-0.22) were lower among children from the richest wealth quintile than their poorest counterparts.

The main risk factors for a child's poor nutritional status include low household wealth, urban residence, and mother's educational status. Similarly, the main risk factors for women's poor nutritional status include increasing the women's age, educational status, rural residence, and household wealth.

Although Bangladesh has made rapid progress over the last decade in the field of health and nutrition, there has been very slow progress in improving the state of child nutrition. Studies aiming at determination of interrelationship between child undernutrition and maternal undernutrition are to be scientifically established if appropriate intervention policy is to be introduced. This study was undertaken to see whether this assumption has a statistically proven basis that maternal undernutrition influences child undernutrition. The objective of this cross sectional analytical study was to evaluate the association between child undernutrition and their maternal undernutrition in child-mother pair in a tertiary care hospital and was conducted from July 2017 to April 2018 in the department of General Paediatrics, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka, Bangladesh. The study subjects were 196 children between the ages of six months to five years who were admitted in BSMMU and their accompanying mothers. Children who had any known chronic diseases or clinically obvious syndrome were excluded. Before enrollment, parents of all the patients were informed about the study & its objectives. Anthropometric measurements of children and mothers were done by standard procedure. Demographic profile and relevant maternal information were collected by interviewing the mothers.

We aimed to provide up-to-date estimates on the burden of disease attributable to WASH and on the effects of different types of WASH interventions on childhood diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated previous reviews following their search strategy by searching MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and BIOSIS Citation Index for studies of basic WASH interventions and of WASH interventions providing a high level of service, published between Jan 1, 2016, and May 25, 2021. We included randomised and non-randomised controlled trials conducted at household or community level that matched exposure categories of the so-called service ladder approach of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for WASH. Two reviewers independently extracted study-level data and assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and certainty of evidence using a modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We analysed extracted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs using random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42016043164.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      19 837 records were identified from the search, of which 124 studies were included, providing 83 water (62 616 children), 20 sanitation (40 799 children), and 41 hygiene (98 416 children) comparisons. Compared with untreated water from an unimproved source, risk of diarrhoea was reduced by up to 50% with water treated at point of use (POU): filtration (n=23 studies; RR 0·50 [95% CI 0·41-0·60]), solar treatment (n=13; 0·63 [0·50-0·80]), and chlorination (n=25; 0·66 [0·56-0·77]). Compared with an unimproved source, provision of an improved drinking water supply on premises with higher water quality reduced diarrhoea risk by 52% (n=2; 0·48 [0·26-0·87]). Overall, sanitation interventions reduced diarrhoea risk by 24% (0·76 [0·61-0·94]). Compared with unimproved sanitation, providing sewer connection reduced diarrhoea risk by 47% (n=5; 0·53 [0·30-0·93]). Promotion of handwashing with soap reduced diarrhoea risk by 30% (0·70 [0·64-0·76]).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      WASH interventions reduced risk of diarrhoea in children in LMICs. Interventions supplying either water filtered at POU, higher water quality from an improved source on premises, or basic sanitation services with sewer connection were associated with increased reductions. Our results support higher service levels called for under SDG 6. Notably, no studies evaluated interventions that delivered access to safely managed WASH services, the level of service to which universal coverage by 2030 is committed under the SDG.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      WHO, Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences."

            "title": "Somewhere to go: assessing the impact of public restroom interventions on reports of open defecation in San Francisco, California from 2014 to 2020.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Open defecation due to a lack of access to sanitation facilities remains a public health issue in the United States. People experiencing homelessness face barriers to accessing sanitation facilities, and are often forced to practice open defecation on streets and sidewalks. Exposed feces may contain harmful pathogens posing a significant threat to public health, especially among unhoused persons living near open defecation sites. The City of San Francisco's Department of Public Works implemented the Pit Stop Program to provide the unhoused and the general public with improved access to sanitation with the goal of reducing fecal contamination on streets and sidewalks. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of these public restroom interventions on reports of exposed feces in San Francisco, California.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We evaluated the impact of various public restroom interventions implemented from January 1, 2014 to January 1, 2020 on reports of exposed feces, captured through a 311 municipal service. Publicly available 311 reports of exposed feces were spatially and temporally matched to 31 Pit Stop restroom interventions at 27 locations across 10 San Francisco neighborhoods. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to compare pre- versus post-intervention rates of feces reports near the restrooms.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Feces reports declined by 12.47 reports per week after the installation of 13 Pit Stop restrooms (p-value = 0.0002). In the same restrooms, the rate of reports per week declined from the six-month pre-intervention period to the post-intervention period (slope change = -0.024 [95% CI = -0.033, -0.014]). In a subset of restrooms, where new installations were made (Mission and Golden Gate Park), and in another subset of restrooms where restroom attendants were provided (Mission, Castro/Upper Market, and Financial District/South Beach), feces reports also declined.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Increased access to public toilets reduced feces reports in San Francisco, especially in neighborhoods with people experiencing homelessness. The addition of restroom attendants also appeared to have reduced feces reports in some neighborhoods with PEH. These interventions should be audited for implementation quality, observed utilization data, and user experience at the neighborhood level in order to tailor sanitation interventions to neighborhood-specific needs."

            "title": "Effect of wealth, social inequality, Mother's BMI, and education level on child malnutrition in India.",
            "abstract": "Background and aims:\n        \n      \n      The differences in prevalence of malnutrition are mostly on account of social factors. However, we did not find any published study that provided an estimate of proportion of stunting and underweight among under-5 children due to household economic conditions, social inequalities, mother's BMI and education level. Hence, study has taken to study the effect of household economic status, social inequality, mother's BMI and education on stunting and underweight among children under-5 years and its determinants.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study used Kids file of NFHS-4 (2015-16), which comprised 259,627 children aged less than five years. This data was analysed by bivariate and Forward Logistic Regression techniques using M.S. Excel and IBM SPSS-22 version.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The prevalence of stunting and underweight children was significantly higher among those born to underweight mothers, poor households, working women, and women had a home delivery. It was also high among children of 4th or higher birth order, those from scheduled castes and tribes, born to illiterate women and those residing in rural. The odds of stunting (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 2.54-2.81) and underweight (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 2.60-2.88) were more than two times higher among children living in poor households than among those from rich households. Poor households account for about 40% of stunted and underweight children. Fifteen percent of stunted children and 26.9% of underweight were born to underweight mothers. Overall, 60% of stunted and 56.6% of underweight children had illiterate mothers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      children of illiterate and underweight mothers, socially deprived and economically poor groups are at a higher risk of being stunted and underweight. Hence, necessary health programmes are needed for improving nutritional status by giving special attention to illiterate, underweight mothers, socially deprived and economically poor groups."
