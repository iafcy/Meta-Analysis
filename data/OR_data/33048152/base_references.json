            "abstract": "Under Australian casemix funding arrangements that use Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs) the average price is policy based, not benchmarked. Cost weights are too low for State-wide chronic disease services. Risk-adjusted Capitation Funding Models (RACFM) are feasible alternatives. A RACFM was developed for public patients with cystic fibrosis treated by an Australian Health Maintenance Organization (AHMO). Adverse selection is of limited concern since patients pay solidarity contributions via Medicare levy with no premium contributions to the AHMO. Sponsors paying premium subsidies are the State of Victoria and the Federal Government. Cost per patient is the dependent variable in the multiple regression. Data on DRG 173 (cystic fibrosis) patients were assessed for heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, structural stability and functional form. Stepwise linear regression excluded non-significant variables. Significant variables were 'emergency' (1276.9), 'outlier' (6377.1), 'complexity' (3043.5), 'procedures' (317.4) and the constant (4492.7) (R(2)=0.21, SE=3598.3, F=14.39, Prob<0.0001. Regression coefficients represent the additional per patient costs summed to the base payment (constant). The model explained 21% of the variance in cost per patient. The payment rate is adjusted by a best practice annual admission rate per patient. The model is a blended RACFM for in-patient, out-patient, Hospital In The Home, Fee-For-Service Federal payments for drugs and medical services; lump sum lung transplant payments and risk sharing through cost (loss) outlier payments. State and Federally funded home and palliative services are 'carved out'. The model, which has national application via Coordinated Care Trials and by Australian States for RACFMs may be instructive for Germany, which plans to use Australian DRGs for casemix funding. The capitation alternative for chronic disease can improve equity, allocative efficiency and distributional justice. The use of Diagnostic Cost Groups (DCGs) is a promising alternative classification system for capitation arrangements."

The purpose of this case report is to describe the 14-month longitudinal rehabilitation management and outcomes from the intensive care unit, inpatient rehabilitation unit and outpatient care of a patient after cerebellar stroke. A goal of this case report is to provide rehabilitation clinicians with a long-term perspective and understanding of the course of recovery for a patient after cerebellar cerebrovascular accident or related injury. A 51-year-old healthy athletic female experienced acute bilateral cerebellar infarcts with subsequent craniotomy to remove infarcted areas. The patient had postoperative hemorrhages and hydrocephalus and was deemed to have a poor prognosis. Multimodal sensory stimulation and early mobility was performed until conventional neuromuscular reeducation interventions could be tolerated. Primary deficits included decreased proximal strength, whole body ataxia, vertical diplopia, dysphagia, difficulty communicating, and emotional lability. Fourteen months after the initial infarcts, the patient was able to reside in her own home with her husband, ambulate, and stand with assistance and perform most activities of daily living with standby or set-up assistance. This patient made significant progress toward safety and mobility and was able to return home despite the early discussion about a poor prognosis and a palliative care consultation. The complex, intensive course of rehabilitation elicited slow, steady, consistent gains. The patient's motivation and family involvement likely facilitated optimum outcomes."

However, data on their impact on routine clinical care remains scarce. Methods: Using a prospective observational registry, we assessed: (1) the clinical and radiological characteristics of all consecutive patients treated with thrombectomy; (2) the outcome of all patients with M1 occlusion (treated with thrombectomy or IVT alone). Two periods were compared: before (2013-2014) and after (2015-2016) the publication of RT. Results: Endovascular procedures significantly increased between the two periods (N = 82 vs. 314, p < 0.0001). In 2015-2016, patients were older (median [IQR]: 69 [57-80]; vs. 66 [53-74]; p = 0.008), had shorter door-to-clot times (69 [47-95]; vs. 110 [83-155]; p < 0.0001) resulting in a trend toward shorter delay from symptom onset to reperfusion (232 [185-300]; vs. 250 [200-339]; p = 0.1), with higher rates of reperfusion (71 vs. 48%; p = 0.0001). Conversely, no significant differences in baseline NIHSS scores, ASPECTS, delay to IVT or intracranial hemorrhage were found. In 2015-2016, patients with M1 occlusion were treated with thrombectomy more often than in 2013-2014 (87 vs. 32%, respectively; p < 0.0001), with a significant improvement in clinical outcome (shift analysis, lower modified Rankin scale scores: OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 1.10-2.57; p = 0.017). Conclusion: Following the publication of RT, thrombectomy was rapidly implemented with significant improvements in intrahospital delay and reperfusion rates. Treatment with thrombectomy increased with better clinical outcomes in patients with M1 occlusion."

            "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), first described by Jean-Martin Charcot in the 1870s, is an age-related disorder that leads to degeneration of motor neurons. The disease begins focally in the central nervous system and then spreads relentlessly. The clinical diagnosis, defined by progressive signs and symptoms of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction, is confirmed by electromyography. Additional testing excludes other conditions. The disease is heterogeneous, but most patients die of respiratory muscle weakness less than 3 years from symptom-onset. Like other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, ALS has genetic and environmental triggers. Of the five to 10% of cases that are inherited, mutations have been discovered for a high proportion. In addition to genetic factors, age, tobacco use, and athleticism may contribute to sporadic ALS, but important etiologies are unidentified for most patients. Complex pathophysiological processes, including mitochondrial dysfunction, aggregation of misfolded protein, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, inflammation and apoptosis, involve both motor neurons and surrounding glial cells. There is clinical and pathological overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases, particularly frontotemporal dementia. The mechanisms leading to disease propagation in the brain are a current focus of research. To date, one medication, riluzole, licensed in 1996, has been proved to prolong survival in ALS. Numerous clinical trials have so far been unable to identify another neuroprotective agent. Researchers now aim to slow disease progression by targeting known pathophysiological pathways or genetic defects. Current approaches are directed at muscle proteins such as Nogo, energetic balance, cell replacement, and abnormal gene products resulting from mutations. Until better understanding of the causes and mechanisms underlying progression lead to more robust neuroprotective agents, symptomatic therapies can extend life and improve quality of life. Palliative care programs such as hospice give emotional and physical support to patients and families throughout much of the disease course."

            "abstract": "The damage to cellular components by reactive oxygen species, termed oxidative stress, both increases with age and likely contributes to age-related diseases including Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cataract formation. In the setting of oxidative stress, hydroxyl radicals can oxidize the benzyl ring of the amino acid phenylalanine, which then produces the abnormal tyrosine isomers meta-tyrosine or ortho-tyrosine. While elevations in m-tyrosine and o-tyrosine concentrations have been used as a biological marker of oxidative stress, there is emerging evidence from bacterial, plant, and mammalian studies demonstrating that these isomers, particularly m-tyrosine, directly produce adverse effects to cells and tissues. These new findings suggest that the abnormal tyrosine isomers could in fact represent mediators of the effects of oxidative stress. Consequently the accumulation of m- and o-tyrosine may disrupt cellular homeostasis and contribute to disease pathogenesis, and as result, effective defenses against oxidative stress can encompass not only the elimination of reactive oxygen species but also the metabolism and ultimately the removal of the abnormal tyrosine isomers from the cellular amino acid pool. Future research in this area is needed to clarify the biologic mechanisms by which the tyrosine isomers damage cells and disrupt the function of tissues and organs and to identify the metabolic pathways involved in removing the accumulated isomers after exposure to oxidative stress."

            "abstract": "Homonymous Visual Field Defects (HVFD) are common following stroke and can be highly debilitating for visual perception and higher level cognitive functions such as exploring visual scene or reading a text. Rehabilitation using oculomotor compensatory methods with automatic training over a short duration (~15 days) have been shown as efficient as longer voluntary training methods (>1 month). Here, we propose to evaluate and compare the effect of an original HVFD rehabilitation method based on a single 15 min voluntary anti-saccades task (AS) toward the blind hemifield, with automatic sensorimotor adaptation to increase AS amplitude. In order to distinguish between adaptation and training effect, 14 left- or right-HVFD patients were exposed, 1 month apart, to three trainings, two isolated AS task (Delayed-shift and No-shift paradigm), and one combined with AS adaptation (Adaptation paradigm). A quality of life questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25) and functional measurements (reading speed, visual exploration time in pop-out and serial tasks) as well as oculomotor measurements were assessed before and after each training. We could not demonstrate significant adaptation at the group level, but we identified a group of nine adapted patients. While AS training itself proved to demonstrate significant functional improvements in the overall patient group, we could also demonstrate in the sub-group of adapted patients and specifically following the adaptation training, an increase of saccade amplitude during the reading task (left-HVFD patients) and the Serial exploration task, and improvement of the visual quality of life. We conclude that short-lasting AS training combined with adaptation could be implemented in rehabilitation methods of cognitive dysfunctions following HVFD. Indeed, both voluntary and automatic processes have shown interesting effects on the control of visually guided saccades in different cognitive tasks."

            "abstract": "Background: The \"smoking paradox\" indicates that patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who smoke at the time of their stroke may have a better prognosis after intravenous thrombolysis than non-smokers. However, findings are inconsistent and data analyzing the effect of smoking on treatment efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis are scarce. Methods: We performed a pre-specified post-hoc subgroup analysis of the Efficacy and Safety of MRI-Based Thrombolysis in Wake-Up Stroke (WAKE-UP) trial that randomized AIS patients with unknown time of symptom onset who had diffusion-weighted imaging-fluid attenuation inversion recovery (DWI-FLAIR) mismatch to either alteplase or placebo. Patients were categorized as current smokers or non-smokers (including former smokers and never-smokers). Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as clinical and imaging follow-up data were analyzed according to smoking status. Results: Four hundred and eighty six patients were included in the analysis. Current smokers (133, 27.4%) were younger (60.1 ± 13.0 vs. 67.2 ± 10.3 years; p < 0.001) and less often had arterial hypertension (45.0% vs. 56.8%; p = 0.02) or atrial fibrillation (3.8% vs. 15.3%; p < 0.001). The acute stroke presentation was more often due to large vessel occlusion among current smokers (27.1 vs. 16.2%; p = 0.01), and smokers had a trend towards more severe strokes (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score>10 in 27.1% vs. 19.5%; p = 0.08). The treatment effect of alteplase, quantified as odds ratio for a favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score at 90 days of 0 or 1), did not differ between current smokers and non-smokers (p-value for interaction: 0.59). After adjustment for age and stroke severity, neither the proportion of patients with favorable outcome, nor the median mRS score at 90 days differed between current smokers and non-smokers. When additional potential confounders were included in the model, the median mRS score was higher in current smokers than in non-smokers (cOR of better outcome for current smokers vs. non-smokers: 0.664 [0.451-0.978], p = 0.04). Conclusions: In patients with mild to moderate MRI-proven AIS and unknown time of symptom onset with DWI-FLAIR mismatch, current smokers had worse functional outcome as compared to non-smokers. Current smoking did not modify the treatment effect of alteplase. Clinical Trial registration: Main trial (WAKE-UP): ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01525290; and EudraCT, 2011-005906-32.

The treatment is challenging and nowadays a comprehensive approach based not only in pharmacological strategies is necessary. Identification and control of comorbidities, non-pharmacological treatment, prevention and management of exacerbations as well as other areas of care (social, psychological) are fundamental for a holistic management of IPF. Gastroesophageal reflux, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, combined with emphysema, lung cancer and cardiovascular involvement are the main comorbidities associated with IPF. Non-pharmacological treatment includes the use of oxygen in patients with rest or nocturnal hypoxemia and other support therapies such as non-invasive ventilation or even a high-flow nasal cannula to improve dyspnea. In some patients, lung transplant should be considered as this enhances survival. Pulmonary rehabilitation can add benefits in outcomes such control of dyspnea, exercise capacity distance and, overall, improve the quality of life; therefore it should be considered in patients with IPF. Also, multidisciplinary palliative care programs could help with symptom control and psychological support, with the aim of maintaining quality of life during the whole process of the disease.

The origin of the other 90% of removed phosphate is unknown. This study tested the hypothesis that the main source of phosphate removed during hemodialysis is the intracellular compartment. Six binephrectomized pigs each underwent one 3-hour hemodialysis session, during which the extracorporeal circulation blood flow was maintained between 100 and 150 ml/min. To determine in vivo phosphate metabolism, we performed phosphorous ((31)P) magnetic resonance spectroscopy using a 1.5-Tesla system and a surface coil placed over the gluteal muscle region. (31)P magnetic resonance spectra (repetition time =10 s; echo time =0.35 ms) were acquired every 160 seconds before, during, and after dialysis. During the dialysis sessions, plasma phosphate concentrations decreased rapidly (-30.4 %; P=0.003) and then, plateaued before increasing approximately 30 minutes before the end of the sessions; 16 mmol phosphate was removed in each session. When extracellular phosphate levels plateaued, intracellular Pi content increased significantly (11%; P<0.001). Moreover, βATP decreased significantly (P<0.001); however, calcium levels remained balanced. Results of this study show that intracellular Pi is the source of Pi removed during dialysis. The intracellular Pi increase may reflect cellular stress induced by hemodialysis and/or strong intracellular phosphate regulation."

Certain therapies for neuropathic pain have better evidence for their use; however, it is apparent that although some therapies provide relief for only a minority of patients, the relief may be significant. Without a trial of therapy, there is no way to know if that relief is achievable. Our treatment experiences have shown that occasionally unexpected benefit is obtained through a thorough investigation of all options, even in the setting of failure of those with the most compelling evidence or indication. Chronic neuropathic pain is generally best treated with regularly dosed medications, balancing efficacy and tolerability. Evidence supports first-line trials of anticonvulsants, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, alone or in certain combinations. While opioid medications, particularly methadone, can be effective in treating neuropathic pain, they are best used only in refractory cases and by experienced clinicians, due to concerns for both short- and long-term safety. Some therapies have a long history of successful use for certain syndromes (e.g., carbamazepine for trigeminal neuralgia pain), but these should not be considered to the exclusion of other more recent, less-supported therapies (e.g., botulinum toxin A for the same), particularly in refractory cases. We find the principles of palliative care highly applicable in the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain, including managing expectations, mutually agreed-upon meaningful outcomes, and a carefully cultivated therapeutic relationship."

Frailty is a state that puts an individual at a higher risk for poor health outcomes and death. Understanding whether a person is frail is important because treatment and health care choices for someone living with frailty may be different from someone who is not (i.e., who is fit). In this review, we discuss strategies and hurdles for engaging older adults living with frailty across three settings: research, health and social care, and policy. We developed this review using published literature, expert opinion, and stakeholder input (including citizens). Engaging frail older individuals will be challenging because of their vulnerable health state - but it can be done. Points of consideration specific to engaging this vulnerable population include:In any setting, family caregivers (defined to include family, friends, and other social support systems) play an important role in engaging and empowering older adults living with frailtyEngagement opportunities need to be flexible (e.g., location, time, type)Incentivizing engagement for researchers and citizens (financial and otherwise) may be necessaryThe education and training of citizens, health and social care providers, and researchers on engagement practicesPatient-centered care approaches should consider the specific needs of individuals living with frailty including end-of-life care and advanced care planningInfluencing policy can occur in many ways including participating at institutional, regional, provincial or national committees that relate to health and social care.\n    \n\n\n          Abstract:\n        \n      \n      Older adults are the fastest growing segment of Canada's population resulting in an increased number of individuals living with frailty. Although aging and frailty are not synonymous the proportion of those who are frail increases with age. Frailty is not defined by a single condition, but rather a health state characterized by an increased risk of physical, mental, or social decline, deterioration of health status, and death. Recognizing frailty is important because earlier detection allows for program implementation focused on prevention and management to reduce future hospitalization, improve outcomes, and enhance vitality and quality of life. Even though older adults living with frailty are significant users of health care resources, their input is under-represented in research, health care decision making, and health policy formulation. As such, engaging older adults living with frailty and their family caregivers is not only an ethical imperative, but their input is particularly important as health and social care systems evolve from single-illness focused to those that account for the complex and chronic needs that accompany frailty. In this review, we summarize existing literature on engaging older adults living with frailty and their family caregivers across three settings: research, health and social care, and policy. We discuss strategies and barriers to engagement, and ethical and cultural factors and implications. Although this review is mainly focused on Canada it is likely to be broadly applicable to many of the health systems in the developed world where aging and frailty pose important challenges."

            "abstract": "Pressure ulcers are regions of localized damage to the skin and underlying tissues that usually develop over bony prominences. They occur as a result of uninterrupted pressure exerted on the skin, soft tissues, muscle, and bone leading to the development of localized ischemia, followed by a cascade of processes resulting in necrosis. Areas of the body commonly predisposed to pressure ulcers include heels, hip, elbows, shoulders, back of the head, knees, thighs, and toes. Ulcer severity is assessed in a variety of ways, but the US National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) staging system is the most commonly used. The NPUAP system includes a four-stage categorization, representing progressive severity from intact skin with non-blanchable redness of localized area in Stage I, to full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone in Stage IV.\n    \n\n      \n      People with impaired mobility (e.g., stroke or spinal cord injury patients) are most vulnerable to pressure ulcers. Conditions such as poor nutrition, poor sensation, urinary and fecal incontinence, and poor overall physical and mental health are predisposing factors to pressure ulcer formation. The incidence of pressure ulcers vary according to settings, with a range of 2.2 to 23.9 percent in long-term nursing facilities. Prevalence of pressure ulcers is used as an indicator of quality for long-term care facilities, and progression of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients is often considered an avoidable complication representing failure of inpatient management. Higher prevalence is reported for the elderly, the acutely ill, and those who have sustained spinal cord injuries. In Canada, pressure ulcer prevalence is reported to range between 5.0% in the hospital setting and up to 30% for spinal cord injured patients in the community.\n    \n\n      \n      Three fundamental approaches that may be employed sequentially in pressure ulcer wound care are reduction or elimination of underlying contributing conditions such as modifying support surfaces and providing nutritional support; provision of local wound care, including but not limited to wound dressing and topical applications to promote healing; and surgical repair of the ulcer, where appropriate. Pressure ulcer wound care modalities are influenced by clinical practice guidelines and local practice patterns, patient-related issues such as comorbidities and nutritional status, and the stage and features of the wound. Though complete healing with the restoration of functional integrity of skin to highest extent possible is the goal of therapy in most cases, the goal of therapy may be palliative for certain patients such as the terminally ill, focusing on reducing discomfort and/or deterioration of the pressure ulcer.\n    \n\n      \n      In a systematic review involving 14,000 patients from 45 health care institutions to determine the prevalence of pressure ulcers in health care settings across Canada, the median prevalence of pressure ulcers in Canada, regardless of health care settings, is reported to be 26%. A study in Ontario, Canada showed that pressure ulcers increase the risk of mortality among geriatric patients by as much as 400%, increase the frequency and duration of hospitalization, and decrease the quality of life of affected patients. It is a source of significant economic burden, estimated to cost approximately $9,000 (Cdn) per patient per month in the community setting. In the United States, it is estimated that total annual cost of treatment of pressure ulcers is $11 billion with treatment cost per case ranging between $37,800 and $70,000.\n    \n\n      \n      Dressings are an integral part of proper pressure ulcer wound care. They protect ulcers from trauma and contamination, and promote healing by absorbing exudate to prevent maceration while providing moisture balance to prevent desiccation which can hinder epithelial cell migration. A wide variety of dressings are available; including many with various combinations of properties such as wound bed preparation (debridement), antimicrobial activity, and moisture control. The purpose of this review is to provide information on comparative effectiveness of currently used dressing products to help inform management policy on stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcer."

The physical examination did not reveal pathological changes except for skin paleness. The biochemical tests showed iron deficiency anemia and elevated Ca 125 (54.5 U/ml) (normal range: 0.00-35.00). Other markers were normal. An abdominal CT revealed a bifocal infiltration of the small intestine. Due to the increasing obstruction symptoms, the patient was operated on. A bifocal small bowel tumor was found intra-surgically. A partial resection of the jejunum and distal ileum was made. The intestines were joined end to end. The histopathological diagnosis corresponded to metastases of malignant melanoma. The postoperative course was uncomplicated. She received two cycles of dacarbazine 1000 mg/day. Due to drug intolerance, the chemotherapy was discontinued. Now, she is receiving hospice care."

            "abstract": "Advanced heart failure has been traditionally treated via either heart transplantation, continuous inotropes, consideration for hospice and more recently via left ventricular assist devices (LVAD). Heart transplantation has been limited by organ availability and the futility of other options has thrust LVAD therapy into the mainstream of therapy for end stage heart failure. Improvements in technology and survival combined with improvements in the quality of life have made LVADs a viable option for many patients suffering from heart failure. The question of when to implant these devices in those patients with advanced, yet still ambulatory heart failure remains a controversial topic. We discuss the current state of LVAD therapy and the risk vs benefit of these devices in the treatment of heart failure."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive cognitive decline associated with global brain damage. Initially, intracellular paired helical filaments composed by hyperphosphorylated tau and extracellular deposits of amyloid-β (Aβ) were postulated as the causing factors of the synaptic dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal death, detected in AD patients. Therefore, the vast majority of clinical trials were focused on targeting Aβ and tau directly, but no effective treatment has been reported so far. Consequently, only palliative treatments are currently available for AD patients. Over recent years, several studies have suggested the involvement of the purinergic receptor P2X7 (P2X7R), a plasma membrane ionotropic ATP-gated receptor, in the AD brain pathology. In this line, altered expression levels and function of P2X7R were found both in AD patients and AD mouse models. Consequently, genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition of P2X7R ameliorated the hallmarks and symptoms of different AD mouse models. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge about the role of the P2X7R in AD."

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a cascade of changes in cognitive, behavioral, and social activities. Several areas of the brain are involved in the regulation of memory. Of most importance are the amygdala and hippocampus. Antioxidant therapy is used for the palliative treatment of different degenerative diseases like diabetes, cirrhosis, and Parkinson's, etc. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of exogenous antioxidants, in particular, β carotene (1.02 and 2.05 mg/kg) against intracerebroventricular injected streptozotocin-induced memory impairment in mice. Streptozotocin (3 mg/kg, i.c.v) was administered in two separate doses (on 1st and 3rd days of treatment) for neurodegeneration. Fifty Albino mice (male) were selected in the protocol, and they were classified into five groups (Group I-control, Group II-disease, Group III-standard, Group IV-V-β-carotene-treated) to investigate the cognitive enhancement effect of selected antioxidants. The cognitive performance was observed following the elevated plus-maze, passive avoidance, and open field paradigms. Acetylcholine esterase, β-amyloid protein, and biochemical markers of oxidative stress such as glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase were analyzed in brain homogenates. In silico activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was determined by the molecular modeling of β-carotene. β-carotene at a dose of 2.05 mg/kg was found to attenuate the deleterious effects of streptozotocin-induced behavioral and biochemical impairments, including the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity. The in silico studies confirmed the binding capacity of β-carotene with the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The administration of β-carotene attenuated streptozotocin-induced cognitive deficit via its anti-oxidative effects, inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, and the reduction of amyloid β-protein fragments. These results suggest that β-carotene could be useful for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease."

            "abstract": "Pain is common in advanced and progressive disease. Up to two-thirds of people with cancer experience pain that needs a strong opioid. This proportion is similar or higher in many other advanced and progressive conditions.\n    \n\n      \n      Despite the increased availability of strong opioids, published evidence suggests that pain which results from advanced disease, especially cancer, remains under-treated.\n    \n\n      \n      Each year 300,000 people are diagnosed with cancer in the UK and it is estimated that there are 900,000 people living with heart failure. Others live with chronic illness such as kidney, liver and respiratory disease, and with neurodegenerative conditions. Many people with these conditions will develop pain for which a strong opioid may be needed.\n    \n\n      \n      The 2008 World Cancer Declaration included a target to make effective pain control more accessible. Several key documents highlight the importance of effective pain control, including ‘Improving supportive and palliative care for adults with cancer’ (NICE cancer service guidance 2004), ‘Control of pain in adults with cancer’ (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline 106), ‘A strategic direction for palliative care services in Wales’ (Welsh Assembly Government 2005) and ‘End of life care strategy’ (Department of Health 2008).\n    \n\n      \n      Strong opioids, especially morphine, are the principal treatments for pain related to advanced and progressive disease, and their use has increased significantly in the primary care setting. However, the pharmacokinetics of the various opioids are very different and there are marked differences in bioavailability, metabolism and response among patients. A suitable opioid must be selected for each patient and, because drug doses cannot be estimated or calculated in advance, the dose must be individually titrated. Effective and safe titration of opioids has a major impact on patient comfort. The World Health Organization has produced a pain ladder for the relief of cancer pain; strong opioids are represented on the third level of the three-step ladder.\n    \n\n      \n      The guideline will address first-line treatment with strong opioids for patients who have been assessed as requiring pain relief at the third level of the WHO pain ladder. It will not cover second-line treatment with strong opioids where a change in strong opioid treatment is required because of inadequate pain control or significant toxicity.\n    \n\n      \n      A number of strong opioids are licensed in the UK. However for pain relief in palliative care a relatively small number are commonly used. This guideline has therefore looked at the following drugs: buprenorphine, diamorphine, fentanyl, morphine and oxycodone. Misinterpretations and misunderstanding have surrounded the use of strong opioids for decades, and these are only slowly being resolved. Until recently, prescribing advice has been varied and sometimes conflicting. These factors, along with the wide range of formulations and preparations, have resulted in errors causing underdosing and avoidable pain, or overdosing and distressing adverse effects. Despite repeated warnings from regulatory agencies, these problems have led on occasion to patient deaths, and resulted in doctors facing the General Medical Council or court proceedings. Additional guidance, including advice on reducing dosing errors with opioid medicines, patient safety incidents arising from medication errors involving opioids and safer use of injectable medicines, is available from the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA).\n    \n\n      \n      This guideline will clarify the clinical pathway and help to improve pain management and patient safety. This guideline will not cover care during the last days of life.\n    \n\n\n          Drug recommendations:\n        \n      \n      The guideline assumes that prescribers will use a drug’s summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients.\n    \n\n\n          Who this guideline is for:\n        \n      \n      The target audience is non-specialist healthcare professionals initiating strong opioids for pain in adults with advanced and progressive disease.

LC-CR was situational and inductive, with experienced patients as co-educators supplemented with two individual interviews. Group-based training and education hours were the same in both arms. Outcomes were time to death or readmission, length of stay and absolute number of deaths or readmissions. No between-arm differences were found in time to death, first readmission, or length of stay. Within 30 days after completion of CR, the absolute number of all-cause readmissions was 117 in the LC arm and 146 in the control arm, adjusted odds ratio 78 (95% CI: 0.61-1.01), P = 0.06. This trend diminished over time. Adding LC strategies to standard CR showed a short term but no significant long-term effect on mortality or readmissions. However, the study was not powered to detect differences in mortality and morbidity. Thus, a risk of overseeing a true effect was present."

            "abstract": "Background: Weekend admission has been found to be associated with higher hospital mortality and longer hospital stay among patients with acute cardiovascular conditions. Whether those admitted on Fridays face similar risk as those admitted on Sundays and Saturdays remain uncertain. Methods: This study used 2012-2013 data from hospital records for nonfatal patients with ischemic stroke in the state of South Carolina. The database contained the records of all hospitalizations in South Carolina except military and federal institutions. Multilevel logistic, negative binomial, and log-linear regression models were performed to explore the temporal pattern by hospital admission on specific day of a week for three outcomes: discharge to hospice care (vs. other alive discharges), length of stay, and total charge, respectively. Each model controlled for the patient age, gender, race/ethnicity, year of hospital admission, season of admission, payer, and Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results: A total of 19,346 nonfatal ischemic stroke hospitalizations were identified. Multilevel logistic regression shows that patients admitted on non-Friday weekdays had a significantly lower odds of being discharged to hospice care as compared with those admitted on Fridays [odds ratio = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-0.99] where there was no significant difference between Friday admissions and weekend admissions. The length of hospital stay for admission on non-Friday weekdays was significantly shorter than that of Friday admissions [incident rate ratio (IRR) = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.84-0.90], whereas longer length of hospital stay was found on weekend admission (IRR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.11). Friday admissions were not associated with higher charges as compared with non-Friday weekday admissions. Conclusions: Some hospitalization outcomes admitted on Fridays seemed to have the \"weekend effects\" too. Further studies are warranted to investigate underlying mechanism for such a difference in outcomes between Friday and other weekdays. Interventions to close the weekend-weekday gap of patient outcomes need to consider the elevated risk on Friday admission."

Microhepatia, abdominal effusion, and multiple anomalous venous anastomoses were the major findings of diagnostic imaging. Hepatic histopathologic changes were consistent with idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension and were indistinguishable from those of dogs with surgically created portocaval anastomosis.

The objectives of our work were to understand physicians' expected use of these new treatments in the US and Europe, and to estimate their potential. To achieve this goal, we conducted surveys amongst US and European Union (EU) pulmonologists caring for patients with IPF. There was a significant difference between EU and US physicians in the treatment of patients with mild disease with pirfenidone; the EU physicians anticipated using pirfenidone for 57% of their patients with mild disease, whereas the US pulmonologists anticipated using it for 34% of their patients (p = 0.01). Regarding patients with severe disease, the US pulmonologists anticipated treating 74% with either pirfenidone (46%) or nintedanib (28%), whereas the EU pulmonologists treated 28% with pirfenidone and anticipated treating 20% with nintedanib. These findings suggest treatment with pirfenidone and nintedanib based on disease severity may vary between US and EU physicians, which may affect patient outcomes."

They occur in about two million people a year worldwide. While ICH continues to be a focus of research in the medical community, there is little data on the differences in outcomes by gender. We aimed to further investigate these differences in our study. Methods This analysis involves a de-identified dataset of all adult patients who presented to one of our hospital system's emergency departments with ICHs as one of the top three discharge diagnoses. This study was considered exempt by our medical school's Institutional Review Board (IRB). Our hospital system comprises over 176 hospitals in the United States with over 8.6 million emergency department visits annually. Logistic regression analyses were performed using JMP 14.1. Outcome variables included the length of stay, mortality, and disposition. Results The cohort (n = 8069) comprised 68% Caucasians, 17% Blacks, 5% Asians, and 1% Hispanic. Forty-eight percent of patients were females with a median age of 71 years. Fifty-two percent of patients were males with a median age of 65 years. One-fifth of the cohort (20%) died while another fifth (21%) were discharged home. Thirteen percent joined hospice. Women were significantly more likely to die or join hospice (p <0.0001, OR 1.304, 95% CI: 1.183-1.440) even after controlling for age. Women also had a significantly shorter length of stay even when controlled for age (P = 0.0002, 95% CI: -1.58 to -0.489, R 2 = 1.5%) with a median of four days for men and three days for women. Conclusion The median age for women with nontraumatic ICH is older than men, which could explain their increased rates of mortality and discharge to hospice. However, even after controlling for age, women were significantly more likely to die or be discharged to hospice. Conversely, men and younger patients had a longer hospital stay and a higher likelihood of being discharged home."

Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effect of an ACP intervention on communication among NH staff, patient, and family. We further investigated whether the intervention affected nursing staff distress. Methods: The ACP intervention was a part of the 4-month cluster randomized controlled COSMOS trial with a 9-month follow-up. Norwegian NH units (n = 72), with 765 patients were invited, and eligible units were cluster randomized to usual care or the intervention group. The ACP intervention consisted of an education program targeting all NH staff (nurses and physicians) and managers. Implementation was supported by a train-the-trainer approach, with regular phone calls from the researchers. The effect of the intervention was assessed by a data collection form and questionnaires. Nursing staff distress was assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory -Nursing Home version. Results: Five hundred and forty five patients from 67 NH units were included and randomized to the intervention (N = 297; 36 units) and control group (N = 248; 31 units). Organized meetings between the family, patient, and nurses were conducted more frequently in the intervention compared to the control group at month 4 (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.6 to 9.4, p = 0.002). Monthly contact between family and nurses was also more frequent in the intervention group (OR = 6.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 3.5, p = 0.010).

Although not exclusive, the organisation of rehabilitation can be multidisciplinary. Fewer than half of the intervention studies measure the impact on activities of daily living and quality of life. Future guidelines must take into account the weak evidence regarding these aspects."

Further training was needed in managing liver-related symptoms, symptom control and end of life issues. All HCP groups wished to increase community provision of palliative care support, but many general practitioners felt unable to manage advanced cirrhosis in the community. There were differences in the optimal trigger for SPC referral with liver HCPs less likely to refer at symptom deterioration. Prognostication, symptom management and service configuration were key areas identified for future research.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      All who responded acknowledged the role of SPC in caring for those dying with cirrhosis and need for further training to improve confidence and enable joint working between SPC, general practice and liver teams.

Our secondary aim was to create a simple identification method for patients with increased need for palliative care by studying the relationship between modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL and symptoms. We sent a self-rating HRQoL questionnaire (RAND-36) and modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) to 300 IPF patients; 84% of the patients responded to these questionnaires. The most prevalent (>80%) symptoms were tiredness, breathlessness, cough and pain in movement. An increasing mMRC score showed a linear relationship (p<0.001) to impaired HRQoL in all dimensions of RAND-36 and the severity of all symptoms in ESAS. Dimensions of RAND-36 fell below general population reference values in patients with mMRC score ≥2. The intensity of pain in movement (p<0.001) and at rest (p=0.041), and the prevalence of chest pain (p<0.001) had a positive linear relationship to increased mMRC score. An increasing mMRC score reflects impaired HRQoL and a high symptom burden. In clinical practice, the mMRC scale could be used for screening and identification of IPF patients with increased need for palliative care."

We describe patient characteristics, including medical and psychiatric conditions, and use a Venn diagram and case study to illustrate the frequency and reality of co-occurring conditions that contribute to the complexity of patients’ health and health care needs. The mean age at admission was 48.9 years (SD = 10.5). Eighty percent were male. Patients experienced a mean of 5.8 medical comorbidities (SD = 2.3) and 1.9 psychiatric disorders (lifetime axis I diagnoses). Forty-one patients (47%) experienced cognitive impairment including HIV-associated dementia. Patients were on a mean of 11.8 (SD = 5.3) medications at admission; 74% were on antiretroviral medications with 55% reporting full adherence. Current alcohol and drug use was common with 54% reporting active use at admission. Our Venn diagram illustrates the breadth of complexity in the clients with 9% of clients living in unstable housing with three or more medical comorbidites and two or more psychiatric diagnoses. Comprehensive HIV program planning should include interventions that can flexibly adapt to meet the multidimensional and complex needs of this segment of patients. Researchers, policymakers and clinicians need to have greater awareness of overlapping medical, psychiatric and psychosocial comorbidities. Inclusion of the needs of these most vulnerable patients in the development of evidence based guidelines is an important step for effectively treating, preventing and planning for the future of HIV/AIDS care."

            "abstract": "Rationale & aim: Various types of cell therapies are currently under investigation for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. To bridge the gap between cell administration and therapeutic outcome, there is a need for non-invasive monitoring of these innovative therapeutic approaches. Spectral photon counting computed tomography (SPCCT) is a new imaging modality that may be suitable for cell tracking. SPCCT is the next generation of clinical CT that allows the selective visualization and quantification of multiple contrast agents. The aims of this study are: (i) to demonstrate the feasibility of using SPCCT to longitudinally monitor and quantify therapeutic cells, i.e. bone marrow-derived M2-polarized macrophages transplanted in rats with brain damage; and (ii) to evaluate the potential of this approach to discriminate M2-polarized macrophages from their encapsulating scaffold. Methods: Twenty one rats received an intralesional transplantation of bone marrow-derived M2-polarized macrophages. In the first set of experiments, cells were labeled with gold nanoparticles and tracked for up to two weeks post-injection in a monocolor study via gold K-edge imaging. In the second set of experiments, the same protocol was repeated for a bicolor study, in which the labeled cells are embedded in iodine nanoparticle-labeled scaffold. The amount of gold in the brain was longitudinally quantified using gold K-edge images reconstructed from SPCCT acquisition. Animals were sacrificed at different time points post-injection, and ICP-OES was used to validate the accuracy of gold quantification from SPCCT imaging. Results: The feasibility of therapeutic cell tracking was successfully demonstrated in brain-damaged rats with SPCCT imaging. The imaging modality enabled cell monitoring for up to 2 weeks post-injection, in a specific and quantitative manner. Differentiation of labeled cells and their embedding scaffold was also feasible with SPCCT imaging, with a detection limit as low as 5,000 cells in a voxel of 250 × 250 × 250 µm in dimension in vivo. Conclusion: Multicolor SPCCT is an innovative translational imaging tool that allows monitoring and quantification of therapeutic cells and their encapsulating scaffold transplanted in the damaged rat brain."

Neurological dysphagia is among the most frequent causes of this condition in the elderly but should be considered a terminal event in Alzheimer-type dementias. Tube feeding is an important resource for facilitating metabolic recovery in cachectic patients and is particularly successful in \"bridging\" and stabilizing therapies prior to major treatment able to cure the patient. Clinical management of tube feeding in \"incurable\" conditions is complex and becomes part of the palliative care and comfort provided in the terminal stages of illness. Non-specialized physicians are often unfamiliar with the theory and practice of end-of-life interventions, and the resulting decisions are in many cases actually contrary to patient comfort. These problems deserve to be more carefully addressed when the patient is unable to cooperate or express his/her preferences and needs. The success of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy has led to increasingly frequent referrals for placement in critically ill elderly patients.

            "abstract": "We examined the feasibility of recruiting US adults ≥45 years old with Fabry disease (FD) for telephone assessments of cognitive functioning. A case-control design matched each FD participant on age, sex, race, and education to four participants from a population-based study. Fifty-four participants with FD age 46-72 years were matched to 216 controls. Standardized cognitive assessments, quality of life (QOL), and medical histories were obtained by phone, supplemented by objective indices of comorbidities. Normalized scores on six cognitive tasks were calculated. On the individual tasks, scores on list recall and semantic fluency were significantly lower among FD participants (p-values < 0.05), while scores on the other four tasks did not differ. After averaging each participant's normalized scores to form a cognitive composite, we examined group differences in composite scores, before and after adjusting for multiple covariates using generalized estimating equations. The composite scores of FD cases were marginally lower than controls before covariate adjustments (p = 0.08). QOL and mental health variables substantially attenuated this finding (p = 0.75), highlighting the influence of these factors on cognition in FD. Additional adjustment for cardiovascular comorbidities, kidney function, and stroke had negligible impact, despite higher prevalence in the FD sample. Telephone-based cognitive assessment methods are feasible among adults with FD, affording access to a geographically dispersed sample. Although decrements in discrete cognitive domains were observed, the overall cognitive function of older adults with FD was equivalent to that of well-matched controls before and after accounting for multiple confounding variables."

            "abstract": "The NHS England Mandate (2013–15) sets an ambition for the NHS to deliver a ‘globally recognised’ standard of end of life care. This is supported by an assessment of global end of life care performance in which our end of life care was rated the best in the world. However, people are still experiencing barriers to accessing good quality end of life care, or in some cases not accessing end of life care at all.\n    \n\n      \n      In 2017 Hospice UK (e-hospice 3rd July Hospice UK analysis ‘One in four UK families who need end of life care miss out on crucial support’) estimated that one in four people, approximately 118,000, who require end of life care and their families are not able to access the expert care they need at the end of life, including hospice care or other support that they need. This is particularly true for people with conditions other than cancer and their analysis also showed that people from economically and socially deprived areas, BAME communities and LGBT people can experience barriers to accessing end of life care services.\n    \n\n      \n      Barriers that prevent people in their last year of life accessing End of Life care can vary but poor communication and coordination of services is an ever-present theme. One of the biggest barriers is for professionals to recognise when someone has entered the last year of life and having the skills to discuss this with openness and sensitivity. This can be compounded by institutional culture, limited resource, restrictive internal policies and lack of training and education all contributing to people experiencing barriers to care during this period. Macmillan Cancer Support (Time to Choose – making choices at end of life 2013) also found similar barriers.\n    \n\n      \n      Lack of information about the out-of-hours services, a reticence of some health care professionals to have ‘difficult conversations’ with patients and carers and poor inter-professional communication can all have an impact on care.\n    \n\n      \n      It is said that nearly three quarters of people with cancer would prefer to die at home and yet less than a third are able to do so. (Macmillan – A Time to Choose, 2013).. While it is true that some will change their mind as their symptoms change, none-the-less there is a large gap between what people want and what they experience.\n    \n\n      \n      In addition to the general barriers, there are other others specific to different communities and groups, for instance a 2014 Marie Curie and Alzheimer’s Society report highlights that ‘dementia is often not recognised as a terminal diagnosis, which can lead to poor access to care, inconsistent quality of care d’..\n    \n\n      \n      The ability of all health and care professionals to recognise when someone is entering the last year of life and the ability to be able to discuss end of life openly, honestly and sensitively are essential gateways to appropriate end of life care. This chapter reviews the themes found in qualitative work about the barriers to accessing end of life care."

Three randomized controlled trials and four single-arm trials were included. The involved participants with NAFLD or NASH (330 patients) were analyzed for clinical outcomes including alteration in hepatic histological variables and biomarkers of liver function. Improvements were observed in levels of alanine aminotransferase [standard mean difference (SMD)=-1.41; P=0.01], aspartate aminotransferase (SMD=-2.06; P=0.0005), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (SMD=-1.91; P=0.05), glucose [mean difference (MD)=-0.51; P=0.01], triglycerides (MD=-0.93; P=0.01), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index (MD=-1.05; P=0.04) and body mass index (MD=-1.97; P=0.02), but not in liver fibrosis score (SMD=-0.14; P=0.71). On sub-analyses of the different patient groups, no significant differences were observed in patients with NASH. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that orlistat could serve as a therapeutic drug to improve biochemical indicators of liver damage, but not as first-choice drug for the management of NAFLD or NASH; thus suggesting a novel palliative drug only for the treatment of NAFLD."

Methods: In this exploratory post-hoc secondary analysis we compared clinical and imaging data, as well as treatment effects and safety of intravenous thrombolysis between patients with infra- vs. supratentorial stroke. Results: Forty-eight out of 503 randomized patients (9.5%) presented with a stroke involving the cerebellum or brainstem. Patients with infratentorial stroke were younger compared to patients with supratentorial stroke (mean age 60 vs. 66 years), more frequently male (85 vs. 62%), and less severely affected (median NIHSS 4.5 vs. 6.0). There was no heterogeneity for treatment effect between supratentorial (OR 1.67 95% CI 1.11-2.51) and infratentorial (OR 1.31 95% CI 0.41-4.22) sub-groups (test for interaction p = 0.70). In patients with infratentorial stroke, favorable outcome [a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 90 days] was observed in 12/22 patients (54.5%) in the alteplase group and in 13/25 patients (52.0%) in the placebo group (p = 0.59). The primary safety endpoint (death or mRS 4-6 at day 90) occurred in three patients of the alteplase group (13.6%) and three patients in the placebo group (12.0%); p = 0.74. Discussion: WAKE-UP was underpowered for demonstrating treatment effect in subgroup analyses however, based on our current results, there is no evidence to recommend withholding MRI-guided thrombolysis in patients with unknown onset stroke of infratentorial localization."

            "abstract": "Dementia and Parkinson's disease are incurable neurological conditions. Patients often experience specific, complex, and varying needs along their disease trajectory. Current management typically employs a multidisciplinary team approach. Recognition is growing that this team approach should also address palliative care issues to optimize quality of life for patient and family caregivers, but it remains unclear how palliative care is best delivered. To inspire future service development and research, we compare the trajectories and conceptualization of palliative care between dementia and Parkinson's disease. Both Parkinson's disease and dementia are characterized by a protracted course, with progressive but fairly insidious development of disability. However, patients with Parkinson's disease may experience relatively stable periods initially but with time, a wide range of debilitating symptoms develops, many of which do not respond well to treatment. Eventually, dementia develops in most Parkinson patients, while motor disability develops in many dementia patients. In both diseases, symptoms such as pain, apathy, sleeping problems, falls, and a high caregiver burden are prevalent. Advance care planning has benefits in terms of being prepared before the disease progresses into a stage with communication problems or severe cognitive impairment. However, for both conditions, the protracted disease trajectories complicate conceptualization of palliative care through different stages of the disease, with pertinent questions such as when to offer what interventions pro-actively. Given the similarities and differences, we should develop palliative approaches that are partially generic and partially disease-specific. These should be integrated seamlessly with disease-specific care. Substantial research is already being performed on dementia palliative care. This may also inform the further development of palliative care for Parkinson's disease, including an evaluation of palliative interventions and services."

To maintain her quality of life, palliative involved-field radiotherapy was performed. The symptoms and tumor markers significantly improved, and computed tomography and endoscopy indicated the disappearance of the primary gastric tumor. Two months after radiotherapy and her return home, she died of pneumonia. Autopsy showed neither lymphoma cells nor stenosis of gastric lesion.

It has not previously been validated for self-assessment. Our aim was to determine whether self-assessment (EC1) can give comparable results to an evaluation performed by professionals (EC2), for older people living at home. The study included community-dwelling individuals (aged at least 60 years, n = 100; 67 females) without dementia (abbreviated mental test score [AMTS] above 6). It comprised two assessments (self and professional), including summarising indexes: Independence score [IS], Risk of breakdown in care [RBC], Risk of falls [RF], performed within a period between 1 and 2 weeks. Additionally, during EC1, reference tests of physical and mental function (Barthel Index: 96.3 ± 6.5, Lawton scale: 6.7 ± 2.0, geriatric depression scale: 3.0 ± 2.7, AMTS: 10.2 ± 1.0) were applied to test for concurrent validity. Cohen's kappa values (self-assessment vs. professional assessment) across all EASYCare domains were high (0.89-0.95). Results of all summarising indexes derived from self-assessment correlated strongly with reference tests. No differences were found in IS and RBC between EC1 and EC2 (8.6 ± 12.0 vs. 9.0 ± 12.7 and 1.0 ± 1.1 vs. 1.2 ± 1.4). Results of RF were higher in EC2 (1.0 ± 1.1 vs. 1.1 ± 1.4; p = 0.005), due to a different response to the item \"Do you feel safe outside your home?\" We conclude that self-assessment with EASYCare Standard in older people without severe functional impairment living at home can deliver valid results, similar to those obtained through professional assessment, thus providing an efficient system for assessment of relatively independent individuals."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Clinicians hesitate to engage with advance care planning (ACP) in heart failure. We aimed to identify the disease-specific barriers and facilitators for clinicians to engage with ACP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, the British Nursing Index, the Cochrane Library, the EPOC register, ERIC, PsycINFO, the Science Citation Index and the Grey Literature from inception to July 2018. We conducted the review according to Enhancing Transparency in Reporting the Synthesis of Qualitative Research (ENTREQ) guidelines. Two reviewers independently assessed original and empirical studies according to Critical Appraisal Skills Programme criteria. The SURE framework and thematic analysis were used to identify barriers and facilitators.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 2308 articles screened, we reviewed the full text of 42 studies. Seventeen studies were included. The main barriers were lack of disease-specific knowledge about palliative care in heart failure, high emotional impact on clinicians when undertaking ACP and lack of multidisciplinary collaboration between healthcare professionals to reach consensus on when ACP is indicated. The main facilitators were being competent to provide holistic care when using ACP in heart failure, a patient taking the initiative of having an ACP conversation, and having the resources to deliver ACP at a time and place appropriate for the patient.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Training healthcare professionals in the delivery of ACP in heart failure might be as important as enabling patients to start an ACP conversation. This twofold approach may mitigate against the high emotional impact of ACP. Complex interventions are needed to support clinicians as well as patients to engage with ACP."

            "abstract": "Heart failure (HF), a complex clinical syndrome due to structural or functional disorder of the heart, is a major global health issue, with a prevalence of over 5.8 million in the USA alone, and over 23 million worldwide. As a leading cause of hospitalizations among patients aged 65 years or older, HF is a major consumer of healthcare resources, creating a substantial strain on the healthcare system. This paper discusses the epidemiology of HF, financial impact, and multifaceted predicaments in end-stage HF care. A search was conducted on the U.S. National Library of Medicine website (www.pubmed.gov) using keywords such as end-stage heart failure, palliative care, ethical dilemmas. Despite the poor prognosis of HF (worse than that for many cancers), many HF patients, caregivers, and clinicians are unaware of the poor prognosis. In addition, the unpredictable clinical trajectory of HF complicates the planning of end-of-life care, such as palliative care and hospice, leading to underutilization of such resources. In conclusion, ethical dilemmas in end-stage HF are numerous, embroiling not only the patient, but also the caregiver, healthcare team, and society."

            "abstract": "To improve the adherence to and knowledge about pharmacotherapy in outpatients and to maximize the efficacy and minimize the adverse drug events, the first pharmacist-managed clinic (PMC) in Japan was established for anticoagulation therapy at Nagoya University Hospital in 2000. Since then, various PMCs such as for asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer's disease, hypercholesterolemia, chronic hepatitis C, cancer chemotherapy, palliative care, chronic kidney disease, and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis have been established and expanded to many hospitals in Japan. Accumulating evidences suggest that PMCs have some beneficial effects on patients' adherence to and knowledge about their pharmacotherapy as well as the clinical outcome, besides being cost-effective. Notably, PMCs for cancer chemotherapy have been approved as a new medical service in hospitals in 2014, which is covered by the universal health coverage in Japan. In this review article, the current status of PMCs for patient education and counseling in Japan and their impact on pharmaceutical care and management are critically reviewed. Furthermore, future perspectives on PMCs are discussed."

            "abstract": "Background: Recent reimbursement cuts for hospitals with higher 30-day heart failure (HF)-related readmission rates call for means of reducing those readmissions. Objective: To determine if pharmacist-initiated education increases HF knowledge and assess if an increase in HF knowledge decreases HF readmission. Methods: This was a prospective interventional study. Participants were ≥18 years old admitted through the emergency department of a 322-bed community hospital with a diagnosis and/or past medical history of HF. Terminal/palliative care patients, patients residing in an assisted-living environment, or patients with a mental illness that deemed them incapable of participating were excluded. Forty-eight patients received pharmacist-initiated HF education on HF pathophysiology and its pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment. Medication assistance and ancillary services were consulted when necessary. Patients' knowledge of HF was assessed using the same questionnaire prior to education and through a follow-up phone call within 7 days postdischarge. Results: Posteducation HF knowledge scores were 13.7 points higher than preeducation scores (P < .05). Twenty-five patients (52%) had HF as a primary discharge diagnosis. Of those patients, 9 (36%) were readmitted within 30 days for any cause. Only 3 patients (12%) had a HF-related diagnosis at readmission. There was a statistical difference in the level of knowledge but that was not translated into a statistical difference in readmission rates. Conclusion: Patients' HF knowledge scores increased after pharmacist education. Improvements in HF knowledge could not be correlated with readmission rates. However, the majority of HF patients in this study did not have a HF-related diagnosis at the time of readmission."

            "abstract": "OPINION STATEMENT: There is no specific treatment for Huntington's disease (HD). Its many symptoms of motor, psychiatric, and cognitive deterioration are managed with symptomatic relief, rehabilitation, and support. The only drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HD is an antichoreic agent, tetrabenazine, but this drug is used sparingly because of uneasiness regarding its propensity to cause depression and suicidality in this population, which is already at risk for these complications. Neuroleptics are still first-line treatments for chorea accompanied by comorbid depression and/or behavioral or psychotic symptoms, as is often the case. Psychiatric features, which have a significant impact on a patient's professional and personal life, often become the major focus of management. In addition to neuroleptics, commonly used medications include antidepressants, mood stabilizers, anxiolytics, and psychostimulants. In contrast, few treatment options are available for cognitive impairment in HD; this remains an important and largely unmet therapeutic need. HD patients typically lack insight into their disease manifestations, failing to recognize their need for treatment, and possibly even arguing against it. Multipurpose medications are employed advantageously to simplify the medication regimen, so as to facilitate compliance and not overwhelm the patient. For example, haloperidol can be prescribed for a patient with chorea, agitation, and anorexia, rather than targeting each symptom with a different drug. This approach also limits the potential for adverse effects, which can be difficult to distinguish from the features of the disease itself. With HD's complexity, it is best managed with a multidisciplinary approach that includes a movement disorders specialist, a genetic counselor, a mental health professional, a physical therapist, and a social worker for support and coordination of services. As the disease progresses, there may be need for other specialists, such as a speech and occupational therapist, a nutritionist for weight loss, and ultimately, a palliative care specialist."

However, when both the HF patient and their long-term partner suffer from chronic illness, they may equally suffer from diminished quality of life and poor health outcomes. With the focus on this specific couple group as a dimension of the HF health care team, we explored this neglected component of supportive care.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      From a large-scale Canadian multisite study, we analyzed the interview data of 13 HF patient-partner couples (26 participants).

Humidified High Flow Nasal Oxygen is a relatively new intervention for respiratory failure, but it has not been researched greatly in a palliative care setting. One device with the capacity to deliver high flow humidified oxygen to spontaneously breathing patients is the myAIRVO2 humidifier.1 The myAIRVO2 is a humidifier with an integrated flow generator that delivers warmed and humidified respiratory gases to a spontaneously breathing patient.1 The following case report describes how the technology was used at home for symptom control in a 76 year old patient with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with associated pulmonary hypertension. The patient was successfully discharged from hospital and managed at home using high-flow nasal oxygen for approximately one month up until his death. In this last month of life, he reported that he was more comfortable on high-flow nasal oxygen than on traditionally-administered oxygen. Humidified High Flow Nasal Oxygen is potentially beneficial to aid in symptom control for palliative care patients in an inpatient and community setting."

This study identified types of care for and co-morbidities of persons dying of breast cancer compared to persons dying from all cancers and from non-cancer causes. Methods: Linked administrative data from population-based registries were used to examine 121,458 deaths in Nova Scotia from 1995 to 2009. Results: Breast cancer decedents' mean age was similar to that of all cancer decedents (72.0 versus 72.1 years), but their age spread was greater (20-59 years: 23.1% versus 16.7%; 90+ years: 11.2% versus 6.5%). Among women dying of breast cancer, 15.6% were enrolled in the diabetes registry and 15.1% in the cardiovascular registry, indicating that they had these non-cancer conditions prior to their death. Compared to all cancer decedents, breast cancer decedents were twice as likely to have dementia as a cause of death, and were less likely to die in hospital but more likely to die in a nursing home. Breast cancer decedents had place of death rates more similar to non-cancer than cancer decedents. Conclusions: Rates of dementia and diabetes among the breast cancer decedents were particularly note-worthy in this novel study given that these comorbidities have not received much attention in the breast cancer research literature. Further collaboration with non-cancer disease programs is advised.

We sought to describe the epidemiologic, clinical, treatment, and prognostic aspects of the disease in adult patients who required admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 36 adults admitted to a total of 64 ICUs throughout France for complications of measles from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2011. All cases of measles were confirmed by serologic testing and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.The cohort consisted of 21 male and 15 female patients, with a median age of 29.2 years (25th-75th interquartile range [IQR], 27.2-34.2 yr) and a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS II) of 13 (IQR, 9-18). Among the 26 patients whose measles vaccination status was documented, none had received 2 injections. One patient had developed measles during childhood. Underlying comorbid conditions included chronic respiratory disease in 9 patients, immunosuppression in 7 patients, and obesity in 3 patients, while measles affected 5 pregnant women.Respiratory complications induced by measles infection led to ICU admission in 32 cases, and measles-related neurologic complications led to ICU admission in 2 cases. Two patients were admitted due to concurrent respiratory and neurologic complications.Bacterial superinfection of measles-related airway infection was suspected in 28 patients and was documented in 8. Four cases of community-acquired pneumonia, 6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, 1 case of tracheobronchitis, and 2 cases of sinusitis were microbiologically substantiated.Of 11 patients who required mechanical ventilation, 9 developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among the patients with ARDS, extraalveolar air leak complications occurred in 4 cases. Five patients died, all of whom were severely immunocompromised.On follow-up, 1 patient had severe chronic respiratory failure related to lung fibrosis, and 2 patients had mild lower limb paraparesis along with bladder dysfunction, both of which were ascribable to measles-induced encephalitis and myelitis. Among the 5 pregnant patients, the course of measles infection was uneventful, albeit 1 patient underwent emergent cesarean delivery because of fetal growth restriction.Measles is a disease with protean and potentially deceptive clinical manifestations, especially in the immunocompromised patient. Measles-associated pneumonitis and its complications, and less commonly postinfectious encephalomyelitis, are the main source of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the usually benign course of the disease in immunocompetent patients, measles occurring in immunocompromised patients gives rise to lethal complications including ARDS, with or without bacterial superinfection. Other patients potentially at high risk for severe measles are young adults and pregnant women. Measles pneumonitis may predispose to air leak disease in patients using mechanical ventilation. To date, vaccination remains the most potent tool to control measles infection."

The palliative care needs of these patients are often unmet. There are calls for new models of care, whereby the patient's usual respiratory clinician remains central to the integration of palliative care principles and practices into their patient's management, but the optimal model of service delivery has yet to be determined.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We developed a novel, collaborative, multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting between our palliative care, psychology and ILD teams with the principal aim of integrating specialist care to ensure the needs of persons with ILD, and their caregivers were identified and met by referral to the appropriate service.

In long-term care settings the achievement of quality palliative care will require attention to all levels of the health and social care system, in both its formal and informal manifestations. We suggest that long-term care facilities will become the hospices of the future, caring for older people with chronic conditions with a long trajectory to death, the most common being dementia. We see this progression as inevitable and appropriate if the right support is provided. We discuss the impact that transferability and sustainability has had on the present provision of palliative care for older people and how that may affect the future. Four forces which are important factors in public policy; leadership, a culture that supports learning throughout the care process, an emphasis on effective team development and the use of information technologies for quality activities are used as a framework for our vision of social planning. We then go on to discuss the impact of costs, workforce, service planning and public awareness as vital areas where progress needs to be carefully tackled. We suggest some likely poor outcomes if this planning does not occur, but indicate that if planning and implementation is effective then services can provide the kind of care the baby boomer generation seeks."

            "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is the leading cause of hospitalization for those over the age of 65 and represents a significant clinical and economic burden. About half of hospital re-admissions are related to co-morbidities, polypharmacy and disabilities associated with CHF. Moreover, CHF also has an enormous cost in terms of poor prognosis with an average one year mortality of 33%-35%. While more than half of patients with CHF are over 75 years, most clinical trials have included younger patients with a mean age of 61 years. Inadequate data makes treatment decisions challenging for the providers. Older CHF patients are more often female, have less cardiovascular diseases and associated risk factors, but higher rates of non-cardiovascular conditions and diastolic dysfunction. The prevalence of CHF with reduced ejection fraction, ischemic heart disease, and its risk factors declines with age, whereas the prevalence of non-cardiac co-morbidities, such as chronic renal failure, dementia, anemia and malignancy increases with age. Diabetes and hypertension are among the strongest risk factors as predictors of CHF particularly among women with coronary heart disease. This review paper will focus on the specific consideration for CHF assessment in the older population. Management strategies will be reviewed, including non-pharmacologic, pharmacologic, quality care indicators, quality improvement in care transition and lastly, end-of-life issues. Palliative care should be an integral part of an interdisciplinary team approach for a comprehensive care plan over the whole disease trajectory. In addition, frailty contributes valuable prognostic insight incremental to existing risk models and assists clinicians in defining optimal care pathways for their patients."

Because of worsening clinical symptoms, high rates of re-hospitalization and mortality, AdHF represents an unstable condition where standard treatments are inadequate and additional interventions must be applied. A heart transplant is considered the optimal therapy for AdHF, but the great problem linked to the scarcity of organs and long waiting lists have led to the use of mechanical circulatory support with ventricular-assist device (VAD) as a destination therapy. VAD placement improves the prognosis, functional status, and quality of life of AdHF patients, with high rates of survival at 1 year, similar to transplant. However, the key element is to select the right patient at the right moment. The complete assessment must include a careful clinical evaluation, but also take into account psychosocial factors that are of crucial importance in the out-of-hospital management. It is important to distinguish between AdHF and end-stage HF, for which advanced therapy interventions would be unreasonable due to severe and irreversible organ damage and, instead, palliative care should be preferred to improve quality of life and relief of suffering.

            "abstract": "Cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. Significant complications include variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and infection. When these complications are severe, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is often required for organ support and management. Intensive care therapy can also serve as a bridge to liver transplantation. Along with decompensation of cirrhosis, the concept of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) has emerged. This involves an acute precipitating event, such as the development of infection in a patient with cirrhosis, which leads to acute deterioration of hepatic function and extrahepatic organ failure. Extrahepatic complications often include renal, cardiovascular, and respiratory failures. Patients with significant extrahepatic and hepatic failures need ICU admission for organ support. Again, in patients who are deemed suitable liver transplant candidates, intensive care management may allow bridging to liver transplantation. However, patients with a Chronic Liver Failure Consortium ACLF score greater than 70 at 48 to 72 hours post-ICU admission do not seem to benefit from ongoing intensive support and a palliative approach may be more appropriate."

Data from all participants were included regardless of level of participation, using an intent-to-treat approach.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive the Collaborative Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness (CASA) intervention or usual care. The CASA intervention included collaborative symptom care provided by a nurse and psychosocial care provided by a social worker, both of whom worked with the patients' primary care clinicians and were supervised by a study primary care clinician, cardiologist, and palliative care physician.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was patient-reported heart failure-specific health status, measured by difference in change scores on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (range, 0-100) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included depression (measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (measured by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire), overall symptom distress (measured by the General Symptom Distress Scale), specific symptoms (pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath), number of hospitalizations, and mortality.\n## RESULTS\nOf 314 patients randomized (157 to intervention arm and 157 to control arm), there were 67 women and 247 men, mean (SD) age was 65.5 (11.4) years, and 178 (56.7%) had reduced ejection fraction. At 6 months, the mean Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score improved 5.5 points in the intervention arm and 2.9 points in the control arm (difference, 2.6; 95% CI, -1.3 to 6.6; P = .19). Among secondary outcomes, depressive symptoms and fatigue improved at 6 months with CASA (effect size of -0.29 [95% CI, -0.53 to -0.04] for depressive symptoms and -0.30 [95% CI, -0.55 to -0.06] for fatigue; P = .02 for both). There were no significant changes in overall symptom distress, pain, shortness of breath, or number of hospitalizations.

We assessed whether an intervention using patient-specific feedback about preferences for discussing end-of-life care would improve the occurrence and quality of communication between patients with COPD and their clinicians.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a cluster-randomized trial of clinicians and patients from the outpatient clinics at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Using self-reported questionnaires, we assessed patients' preferences for communication, life-sustaining therapy, and experiences at the end of life. The intervention clinicians and patients received a one-page patient-specific feedback form, based on questionnaire responses, to stimulate conversations. The control group completed questionnaires but did not receive feedback. Patient-reported occurrence and quality of end-of-life communication (QOC) were assessed within 2 weeks of a targeted visit. Intention-to-treat regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering of patients within clinicians.\n## RESULTS\nNinety-two clinicians contributed 376 patients. Patients in the intervention arm reported nearly a threefold higher rate of discussions about end-of-life care (unadjusted, 30% vs 11%; P < .001). Baseline end-of-life communication was poor (intervention group QOC score, 23.3; 95% CI, 19.9-26.8; control QOC score, 19.2; 95% CI, 15.9-22.4). Patients in the intervention arm reported higher-quality end-of-life communication that was statistically significant, although the overall improvement was small (Cohen effect size, 0.21).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA one-page patient-specific feedback form about preferences for end-of-life care and communication improved the occurrence and quality of communication from patients' perspectives.\n## TRIAL REGISTRY\nClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00106080; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n"

Fortunately, this syndrome of challenging treatment is not that frequent. It involves a spectrum of obstructions to the blood flow within the left heart and is characterized by an inappropriate size of the left ventricle associated with a wide variety of valvular dysfunctions. Treatment ranges from heart transplantation to palliative surgical procedures.

Up to half of these patients may be approaching the end of their life, and many also have repeated hospital admissions. We therefore undertook a quality improvement project to help us identify the prevalence of frail older inpatients approaching end of life and to better identify these patients in advance. We also developed and evaluated a pro forma to assist in initiating an advance care planning conversation with the patient and/or family. Fifty percent of our frail older inpatients were assessed as approaching end of life. Factors identifying older inpatients as more likely to die during the hospital admission included residence in a care home, two or more hospital admissions over the preceding 12 months, and a diagnosis of some form of dementia for more than 3 years. A novel goals and priorities of care (GPOC) document was found to support and guide palliative care conversations. Acute hospital care could be organised more effectively to recognise the potential need for palliative care in frail older patients. Identifying those at higher risk and using structured interviews and documentation is helpful, ultimately resulting in more appropriate care. Well-developed communication skills are needed for these complex care planning conversations."

However, the clinical relevance is uncertain. We explored whether the extent of FHVs is associated with outcome and how FHVs modify treatment effect of thrombolysis in a subgroup of patients with confirmed unilateral vessel occlusion from the randomized controlled WAKE-UP trial. Methods: One hundred sixty-five patients were analyzed. Two blinded raters independently assessed the presence and extent of FHVs (defined as the number of slices with visible FHV multiplied by FLAIR slice thickness). Patients were then separated into two groups to distinguish between few and extensive FHVs (dichotomization at the median <30 or ≥30). Results: Here, 85% of all patients (n = 140) and 95% of middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion patients (n = 127) showed FHVs at baseline. Between MCA occlusion patients with few and extensive FHVs, no differences were identified in relative lesion growth (p = 0.971) and short-term [follow-up National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score; p = 0.342] or long-term functional recovery [modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <2 at 90 days poststroke; p = 0.607]. In linear regression analysis, baseline extent of FHV (defined as a continuous variable) was highly associated with volume of hypoperfused tissue (β = 2.161; 95% CI 0.96-3.36; p = 0.001). In multivariable regression analysis adjusted for treatment group, stroke severity, lesion volume, occlusion site, and recanalization, FHV did not modify functional recovery. However, in patients with few FHVs, the odds for good functional outcome (mRS) were increased in recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) patients compared to those who received placebo [odds ratio (OR) = 5.3; 95% CI 1.2-24.0], whereas no apparent benefit was observed in patients with extensive FHVs (OR = 1.1; 95% CI 0.3-3.8), p-value for interaction was 0.11. Conclusion: While the extent of FHVs on baseline did not alter the evolution of stroke in terms of lesion progression or functional recovery, it may modify treatment effect and should therefore be considered relevant additional information in those patients who are eligible for intravenous thrombolysis.

HT can show a wide range from petechiae to parenchymal hematoma with mass effect with varying clinical impact. We studied clinical and imaging characteristics of patients with HT and evaluated whether different types of HT are associated with functional outcome. Methods: We performed a post-hoc analysis of WAKE-UP, a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of MRI-guided intravenous alteplase in unknown onset stroke. HT was assessed on follow-up MRI or CT and diagnosed as hemorrhagic infarction type 1 and type 2 (HI1 and HI2, combined as HI), and parenchymal hemorrhage type 1 and type 2 (PH1 and PH2, combined as PH). Severity of stroke symptoms was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at baseline. Stroke lesion volume was measured on baseline diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Primary endpoint was a favorable outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score 0-1 at 90 days. Results: Of 483 patients included in the analysis, 95 (19.7%) showed HI and 21 (4.4%) had PH. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified treatment with alteplase (OR, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.28-3.40]), baseline NIHSS score (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.05-1.17]), DWI lesion volume (OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]), baseline glucose levels (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00-1.01]) and atrial fibrillation (OR, 3.02 [95% CI, 1.57-5.80]) as predictors of any HT. The same parameters predicted HI. Predictors of PH were baseline NIHSS score (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.01-1.22]) and as a trend treatment with alteplase (OR, 2.40 [95% CI, 0.93-6.96]). PH was associated with lower odds of favorable outcome (OR 0.25, 95% [CI 0.05-0.86]), while HI was not. Conclusion: Our results indicate that HI is associated with stroke severity, cardiovascular risk factors and thrombolysis. PH is a rare complication, more frequent in severe stroke and with thrombolysis. In contrast to HI, PH is associated with worse functional outcome. The impact of HT after MRI-guided intravenous alteplase for unknown onset stroke on clinical outcome is similar as in the trials of stroke thrombolysis within a known early time-window."

By retrospective chart review, we evaluated: (i) rate of usage of narcotic analgesics and (ii) survival time from onset of coma (Glasgow Coma Scale less than 8). Time between coma and death was significantly shorter in the liver disease patients (cirrhosis and/or HCC: 7.0 h) than in lung cancer (44.0 h, p = 0.045). Total bilirubin was higher in HCC compared with cirrhosis (p<0.01). Rate of usage of narcotic analgesics was higher in lung cancer (20/33: 60.6%) than in liver disease (17/83: 20.5%, p<0.01); analgesics were used more frequently in HCC than in liver cirrhosis (p<0.01).

Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a relatively novel procedure for treating recurrent and metastatic tumors. It is used for debulking tumors and as adjuvant therapy for palliative care apart from its role as a pain management tool. Its use in the third world countries is limited by various factors such as cost and expertise. In the remotest parts of India, where economic development has been slow, abject poverty with poor health care facilities advanced malignancies present a challenge to health care providers. We undertook this study to assess the safety of the percutaneous RFA tumor ablation as a therapeutic or palliative measure in patients where surgery was not possible.

Conventional Treatment has been defined as surgical resection, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy, although the patient eligibility for each treatment may vary.\n    \n\n\n          Exclusion criteria:\n        \n      \n      Patients with the following were excluded: (1) Severe coagulopathy, (2) heart, renal, or liver failure, (3) lesions within 1 cm of gall bladder, hilum, bowel wall, and major blood vessels, (4) patient with any metal implant, (5) patients in sepsis, and (6) tumor adjacent to structures at risk (main bile ducts, pericardium, stomach, or bowel).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The duration of procedure as well as ablation of tumor free margin was significantly related to the size of the tumor. As the size of tumor increased, duration of procedure increased significantly. A good tumor-free margin also needs to be ablated for optimum results as it prevents residual tumors and recurrences in the future. We observed that tumors sized <3.1 cm were optimal in this regard. Most common adverse event in postprocedure period was pain in and around ablation site. Post-RFA syndrome is also a common and benign self-limiting side effect. Patient counseling and proper selection of patients in the early stages of malignancy can enhance the efficacy of the procedure and patient satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Percutaneous image-guided RFA is an option in patients where most other tumor management modalities have been exhausted or rejected. RFA may not be free from side effects such as postablation syndrome, pain, and there may be other serious complications such as bleeding, but based on our observations, percutaneous image-guided RFA of tumors is a safe palliative and therapeutic treatment option."

The interviews were analyzed by a qualitative descriptive approach. The main categories derived from the patient interviews were: understanding of illness and prognosis, health care services and social life. The patients expressed the need for better information and communication regarding illness and prognosis, and the desire for more respectful treatment by health care providers. Heart failure was not recognized as a potentially life-limiting disease, and the patients had no experience with palliative care services.

            "abstract": "Extrahepatic bile duct cancer (EBDC) is a rare malignancy that involves neoplastic changes extending from both hepatic ducts to the common bile duct. The treatment of choice is surgical resection, but the predominant pattern of initial treatment failure is locoregional recurrence. Accordingly, adjuvant radiotherapy has been administered after surgical resection based on these rationales. At this time, there is minimal evidence supporting adjuvant radiotherapy, because there have been no phase III trials evaluating its benefit. Relatively small retrospective studies have tried to compare outcomes associated with EBDC treated with or without radiotherapy. We aimed to review studies investigating adjuvant radiotherapy for resected EBDC. Because less than one-third of EBDC cases are amenable to curative resection at diagnosis, other locoregional treatment modalities need to be considered, including radiotherapy. The next aim of this review was to summarize reports of definitive radiotherapy for unresectable EBDC. Patients with advanced EBDC often experience biliary obstruction, which can lead to jaundice and progress to death. Biliary stent insertion is an important palliative procedure, but stents are prone to occlusion after subsequent ingrowth of the EBDC. Radiotherapy can be effective for maintaining the patency of inserted stents. We also reviewed the benefit of palliative radiotherapy combined with the biliary stent insertion. Lastly, we discuss the existing gaps in the evidence supporting radiotherapy in the management of EBDC."

This study compared effects of facilitated case conferencing (FCC) with usual care (UC) on end-of-life care.\n## METHODS\nA two arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted. The sample included people with advanced dementia from 20 Australian nursing homes and their families and professional caregivers. In each intervention nursing home (n = 10), Palliative Care Planning Coordinators (PCPCs) facilitated family case conferences and trained staff in person-centred palliative care for 16 hours per week over 18 months. The primary outcome was family-rated quality of end-of-life care (End-of-Life Dementia [EOLD] Scales). Secondary outcomes included nurse-rated EOLD scales, resident quality of life (Quality of Life in Late-stage Dementia [QUALID]) and quality of care over the last month of life (pharmacological/non-pharmacological palliative strategies, hospitalization or inappropriate interventions).\n## RESULTS\nTwo-hundred-eighty-six people with advanced dementia took part but only 131 died (64 in UC and 67 in FCC which was fewer than anticipated), rendering the primary analysis under-powered with no group effect seen in EOLD scales. Significant differences in pharmacological (P < 0.01) and non-pharmacological (P < 0.05) palliative management in last month of life were seen. Intercurrent illness was associated with lower family-rated EOLD Satisfaction with Care (coefficient 2.97, P < 0.05) and lower staff-rated EOLD Comfort Assessment with Dying (coefficient 4.37, P < 0.01).

We sought to identify and remove key barriers to rapid administration of PCC at our centre. We describe a single UK comprehensive stroke centre cohort study with mixed retrospective (1/1/2008 to 1/12/2010) and prospective (1/12/2010 to 31/7/2014) participant identification and a survey of UK stroke physicians. Seven hundred and thirteen ICH patients were admitted during the study period. Sixty nine of these patients were VKA-ICH. Patients not admitted on the acute stroke pathway (n=8) or who had palliative care commenced immediately on admission (n=6) were excluded, leaving 55 patients in the final analysis. During 2011/12 we identified and implemented service changes to reduce delays in PCC administration. The primary outcome was the time interval between diagnostic brain scan and commencement of PCC treatment (scan-to-needle time). Secondary outcomes were the time interval between admission and commencement of PCC (door-to-needle time) and symptom onset and commencement of PCC (onset-to-needle time). Three key barriers were identified to rapid administration of PCC, including haematology consultation, collection of PCC from the transfusion laboratory, and obtaining the laboratory INR result. Our survey indicated that these barriers existed at most UK centres. We implemented point-of-care INR testing, moved PCC to the emergency department, and agreed a protocol to administer PCC autonomously. Our scan-to-needle time more than halved, from a median of 127 min (interquartile range (IQR), 111 to 208 min) prior to service changes to 58 min (IQR 50 to 91 min; p<0.001) afterwards. We have substantially reduced delays in delivering PCC to VKA-ICH patients at our centre and our simple changes could be easily implemented at centres facing similar barriers."

Patients with chronic non-malignant lung disease often have limited access to palliative care. The symptom burden and the QoL of these patients resembles patients with cancer and the general palliative approach is similar. However, the disease trajectory is often slow and unpredictable, and the palliative effort must be built on accessibility, continuity and professional competences. The Danish Health Authority as well as the WHO recommends that there is access to palliative care for all patients with life-threatening diseases regardless of diagnosis. In 2011, the Danish Health Authority requested that the national medical societies would to formulate guidelines for palliation. Methods: In 2015, a group of members of the Danish Respiratory Society (DRS) was appointed for this purpose. It was composed of experienced ILD and COPD researchers as well as clinicians from different parts of Denmark. A literature review was made, a draft was prepared, and all recommendations were agreed upon unanimously.

The aim of our review was to identify possible methods for risk assessment and prehabilitation in order to improve recovery and postoperative outcome. The literature search was performed via PubMed, Embase, OvidSP, and the Cochrane Library. We collected papers published in peer-reviewed journals between 2001 and 2018. The selection criterion was the relationship between vascular surgery, frailty and postoperative outcome or mortality. A total number of 52 publications were included. Frailty increases the risk of non-home discharge independently of presence or absence of postoperative complications and it is related to a higher 30-day mortality and major morbidity. The modified Frailty Index showed significant association with elevated risk for post-interventional stroke, myocardial infarction, prolonged in-hospital stays and higher readmission rates. When adjusted for comorbidity and surgery type, frailty seems to impact medium-term survival (within 2 years). Preoperative physical exercising, avoidance of hypalbuminemia, psychological and cognitive training, maintenance of muscle strength, adequate perioperative nutrition, and management of smoking behaviours are leading to a reduced length of stay and a decreased incidence of readmission rate, thus improving the effectiveness of early rehabilitation. Pre-frailty is a dynamically changing state of the patient, capable of deteriorating or improving over time. With goal-directed preoperative interventions, the decline can be prevented."

The patient subsequently received nivolumab and was considered have disease progression based on conventional diagnostic imaging after two cycles of treatment. He underwent a debulking surgical resection and pathological diagnosis was recurrent disease. During the surgery, tumor tissues were also collected from the enhancing and non-enhancing areas for a scRNAseq analysis to investigate the tumor microenvironment of these radiographically divergent areas. The scRNAseq analysis reveals a plethora of immune cells, suggesting that the increased mass observed on MRI may be partially a result of immune cell infiltration. The patient continued to receive immunotherapy after a short course of palliative radiation and remained free of disease progression for at least 12 months after the last surgery, suggesting a sustained response to immunotherapy. The scRNAseq analysis indicated that the radiological progression was in large part due to immune cell infiltrate and continued immunotherapy led to a positive clinical outcome in a patient who would have otherwise been admitted to hospice care with halting of immunotherapy. Our study demonstrates the potential of scRNAseq analyses in understanding the tumor microenvironment, which may assist the clinical decision-making process for challenging glioma cases following immunotherapy."

The Guy's and St Thomas's NHS Foundation Trust (GSTT) @home service 'Bringing hospital care to your home' was commissioned by Lambeth and Southwark CCG in 2014 to provide acute care in the patients' place of residence by facilitating rapid discharge from hospital. The service is designed for 260-280 referrals each month from local hospitals, London Ambulance Service, GPs, district nurses and palliative care services. The GSTT@home provides intensive care for a short episode through multidisciplinary team work with the aim of returning the patient to their prior health status following an acute episode of ill health. The main criteria for referrals are adults, living within Lambeth or Southwark with an acute onset of illness often with acute exacerbations of chronic conditions. Care is delivered using 25 clinical pathways using integrated care teams, including those for respiratory disease, heart failure and palliative care services. Recently, the service extended to include overnight palliative care. As care shifts from hospital to the community, it is envisaged that these types of programmes will become an essential component of care provision. This paper describes the service and presents initial service evaluation data."

Palliative care is applicable for people with dementia, however they are less likely to have access to palliative care. This narrative review summarizes specifics of palliative care in advanced dementia. Most people with advanced dementia live and die in institutional care and they suffer a range of burdensome symptoms and complications. Shortly before dying people with advanced dementia suffer symptoms as pain, eating problems, breathlessness, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and complications as respiratory or urinary infections and frequently experience burdensome transitions. Pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions may reduce symptom burden. Sensitive observation and appropriate assessment tools enable health professionals to assess symptoms and needs and to evaluate interventions. Due to lack of decisional capacity, proxy decision making is often necessary. Advanced care planning is an opportunity establishing values and preferences and is associated with comfort and decrease of burdensome interventions. Family carers are important for people with advanced dementia they also experience distress and are in need for support. Recommendations refer to early integration of palliative care, recognizing signs of approaching death, symptom assessment and management, advanced care planning, person-centered care, continuity of care, and collaboration of health care providers."

There are only few case reports of isolated penile Fournier's gangrene in literature. Its rare occurrence, associated with complex and serious comorbidity, poses a major challenge to the attending medical personnel. A 53-year-old Caucasian patient with poorly controlled diabetes, progressive renal insufficiency, and multiple vascular complications presented with progressive necrosis of the penis (localized Fournier's gangrene). Discussion. Fournier's gangrene or necrotizing fasciitis refers to any synergistic necrotizing infection of the external genitalia or perineum and is a hallmark of severe systemic vascular disease. Fournier's gangrene is an absolute emergency because the time interval between diagnosis and treatment significantly influences morbidity and mortality. Despite aggressive management, the estimated mortality rates range from 57 to 71%. Conclusions. Improved integration of palliative care services into the care of such patients is important to improve end-of-life care even though they do not have a malignant disease.

Studies documenting high stress levels on oncology services and the prevalence among physicians of alcoholism, cirrhosis, suicide, and marital discord lend urgency to the need to examine etiologic factors, clinical manifestations, and strategies for the management of job-related stress. Significant etiologic factors include death as an existential fact emphasizing our finite nature, the cumulative grief associated with repeated unresolved losses, the pressure of a health care system fueled by the medical information explosion, the inability to achieve the idealistic goals embraced by holistic medical care, stresses inherent in working as a \"team,\" and an undermined context of meaning as an outcome of treatment failures. Clinical manifestations of stress are reviewed as an aid to early diagnosis. Strategies useful in the prevention and management of stress include the encouragement of increased awareness of stress in self and colleagues, the clarification of appropriate goals and priorities, encouragement of appropriate limit setting, the mobilization of collaborative input, the clarification of team roles and organizational patterns, the establishment of team support meetings and favorable working conditions, exercise, and the clarification and working through of previously unresolved personal psychodynamic issues.

While evidence is limited, there is growing recognition that care of patients with advanced disease needs to improve. Many factors limit widespread provision of good palliative care to these patients, including the unpredictable trajectory of chronic liver disease, the misconception that palliative care and end-of-life care are synonymous, lack of confidence in prescribing and lack of time and resources. Healthcare professionals managing these patients need to develop the skills to ensure effective delivery of core palliative care, with referral to specialist palliative care services reserved for those with complex needs. Core palliative care is best delivered by the hepatology team in parallel with active disease management. This includes ensuring that discussions about disease trajectory and advance care planning occur alongside active management of disease complications. Liver disease is strongly associated with significant social, psychological and financial hardships for patients and their carers; strategies that involve the wider multidisciplinary team at an early stage in the disease trajectory help ensure proactive management of such issues. This review summarises the evidence supporting palliative care for patients with advanced chronic liver disease, presents examples of current best practice and provides pragmatic suggestions for how palliative and disease-modifying care can be run in parallel, such that patients do not miss opportunities for interventions that improve their quality of life."

As patients develop progressive hypotension and side effects from medicines, I often will discontinue these medicines after careful communication. For patients with refractory heart failure, I consider cardiac transplantation for those who are candidates and left ventricular assist device as destination therapy for those who are not transplant candidates, both of which require multidisciplinary input from psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, and cardiac surgeons. If patients are not candidates for these advanced therapies, I try to delineate their goals for living and discuss strategies to maximize their survival (however limited) and increase my focus on their quality of life by minimizing unnecessary testing. For the select patient, I use continuous inotrope support only if this improves their quality of life and possibility of having a meaningful existence outside of the hospital. Palliative care consultants are often involved at this stage. For the patient who is clearly at the end of life, I refer to hospice and focus on comfort. Return ambulatory visits and extent of the care received are guided by the preferences of the patient and their family.

            "abstract": "Chronic pain is highly prevalent and more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) than people of similar age/sex in the general population. This systematic review aimed to describe how frequently and in which contexts pain is considered in the clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the broad management of COPD. Databases (Medline, Scopus, CiNAHL, EMbase, and clinical guideline) and websites were searched to identify current versions of COPD CPGs published in any language since 2006. Data on the frequency, context, and specific recommendations or strategies for the assessment or management of pain were extracted, collated, and reported descriptively. Of the 41 CPGs (English n = 20) reviewed, 16 (39%) did not mention pain. Within the remaining 25 CPGs, pain was mentioned 67 times (ranging from 1 to 10 mentions in a single CPG). The most frequent contexts for mentioning pain were as a potential side effect of specific pharmacotherapies (22 mentions in 13 CPGs), as part of differential diagnosis (14 mentions in 10 CPGs), and end of life or palliative care management (7 mentions in 6 CPGs). In people with COPD, chronic pain is common; adversely impacts quality of life, mood, breathlessness, and participation in activities of daily living; and warrants consideration within CPGs for COPD."

However published guidance focuses primarily on the end of life, and there is a gap in the evidence about how the palliative care needs of acute stroke patients and families should be addressed. Synthesising data across a programme of related studies, this paper presents an explanatory framework for the integration of palliative and acute stroke care.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from a survey (n=191) of patient-reported palliative care needs and interviews (n=53) exploring experiences with patients and family members were explored in group interviews with 29 staff from 3 United Kingdom stroke services.

The Special Report discusses the future challenges of meeting care demands for the growing number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States with a particular emphasis on primary care. By mid-century, the number of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia may grow to 13.8 million. This represents a steep increase from the estimated 5.8 million Americans age 65 and older who have Alzheimer's dementia today. Official death certificates recorded 122,019 deaths from AD in 2018, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2018, deaths resulting from stroke, HIV and heart disease decreased, whereas reported deaths from Alzheimer's increased 146.2%. In 2019, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.6 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at nearly $244 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2020 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be $305 billion. As the population of Americans living with Alzheimer's dementia increases, the burden of caring for that population also increases. These challenges are exacerbated by a shortage of dementia care specialists, which places an increasing burden on primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide care for people living with dementia. Many PCPs feel underprepared and inadequately trained to handle dementia care responsibilities effectively. This report includes recommendations for maximizing quality care in the face of the shortage of specialists and training challenges in primary care."

Participants in the meeting should use any existing advance care planning information, as appropriate, to develop 'best interests advice' (which can be referred to at a later date when a best interests decision needs to be made for the patient). Any future medical care plan should be reviewed for applicability and validity if the person's condition changes (improves or deteriorates), if the patient or those close to the patient request it, or 6-12 months after the initial plan is made. Education, training and support must be provided to ensure acceptance and understanding of the PEACE (PErsonalised Advisory CarE) process and general end of life care in the community.

            "abstract": "With dramatically increasing proportions of older people, global ageing has remarkably influenced healthcare services and policy making worldwide. Older people represent the majority of patients with cancer, leading to the increasing demand of healthcare due to more comorbidities and inherent frailty. The preference of older people with cancer are often ignored, and they are considered incapable of making choices for themselves, particularly medical decisions. This might impede the provision of their preferred care and lead to poor healthcare outcomes. Advance care planning (ACP) is considered an effective intervention to assist older people to think ahead and make a choice in accordance with their wishes when they possess capacity to do so. The implementation of ACP can potentially lead to positive impact for patients and families. However, the assessment of mental capacity among older adults with cancer might be a crucial concern when implementing ACP, as loss of mental capacity occurs frequently during disease deterioration and functional decline. This article aims to answer the following questions by exploring the existing evidence. How does ACP develop for older people with cancer? How can we measure mental capacity and what kind of principles for assessment we should apply? What are the facilitators and barriers when implementing an ACP in this population? Furthermore, a discussion about cultural adaptation and relevant legislation in Asia is elucidated for better understanding about its cultural appropriateness and the implications. Finally, recommendations in relation to early intervention with routine monitoring and examination of capacity assessment in clinical practice when delivering ACP, reconciling patient autonomy and family values by applying the concept of relational autonomy, and a corresponding legislation and public education should be in place in Asia. More research on ACP and capacity assessment in different cultural contexts and policy frameworks is highlighted as crucial factors for successful implementation of ACP."

This is partly because of the challenging nature of dementia itself, and partly because of system failings that are particularly salient in primary care and community services. There is a need to systematize palliative care for people with dementia, to clarify where changes in practice could be made.To develop a model of palliative care for people with dementia that captures commonalities and differences across Europe, a technology development approach was adopted, using mixed methods including 1) critical synthesis of the research literature and policy documents, 2) interviews with national experts in policy, service organisation, service delivery, patient and carer interests, and research in palliative care, and 3) nominal groups of researchers tasked with synthesising data and modelling palliative care.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      A generic model of palliative care, into which quality indicators can be embedded.

Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are equivalent regarding clinical outcomes, but peritoneal dialysis is much less costly to provide. Peritoneal dialysis is most often done in the home by the patient or a support person and carries a self-care burden on patients and families.

Randomization was stratified by country and median number of beds in each country in a 1:1 ratio.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nThe PACE Steps to Success Program is a multicomponent intervention to integrate basic nonspecialist palliative care in nursing homes. Using a train-the-trainer approach, an external trainer supports staff in nursing homes to introduce a palliative care approach over the course of 1 year following a 6-steps program. The steps are (1) advance care planning with residents and family, (2) assessment, care planning, and review of needs and problems, (3) coordination of care via monthly multidisciplinary review meetings, (4) delivery of high-quality care focusing on pain and depression, (5) care in the last days of life, and (6) care after death.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary resident outcome was comfort in the last week of life measured after death by staff using the End-of-Life in Dementia Scale Comfort Assessment While Dying (EOLD-CAD; range, 14-42). The primary staff outcome was knowledge of palliative care reported by staff using the Palliative Care Survey (PCS; range, 0-1).\n## RESULTS\nConcerning deceased residents, we collected 551 of 610 questionnaires from staff at baseline and 984 of 1178 postintervention in 37 intervention and 36 control homes. Mean (SD) age at time of death ranged between 85.22 (9.13) and 85.91 (8.57) years, and between 60.6% (160/264) and 70.6% (190/269) of residents were women across the different groups. Residents' comfort in the last week of life did not differ between intervention and control groups (baseline-adjusted mean difference, -0.55; 95% CI, -1.71 to 0.61; P = .35). Concerning staff, we collected 2680 of 3638 questionnaires at baseline and 2437 of 3510 postintervention in 37 intervention and 38 control homes. Mean (SD) age of staff ranged between 42.3 (12.1) and 44.1 (11.7) years, and between 87.2% (1092/1253) and 89% (1224/1375) of staff were women across the different groups. Staff in the intervention group had statistically significantly better knowledge of palliative care than staff in the control group, but the clinical difference was minimal (baseline-adjusted mean difference, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.02-0.05; P < .001). Data analyses began on April 20, 2018.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nResidents' comfort in the last week of life did not improve after introducing the PACE Steps to Success Program. Improvements in staff knowledge of palliative care were clinically not important.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nISRCTN Identifier: ISRCTN14741671.\n"

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by synaptic loss and cognitive impairments. Although AD is the most prevalent aging-related neurodegenerative disease, therapeutic strategies remain palliative. Recent studies have shown that probucol presents neuroprotective effects in experimental models of neurodegenerative disease. The present study aimed to investigate the potential protective effects of probucol against streptozotocin (STZ)-induced cognitive impairment and hippocampal biochemical changes (oxidative stress-related parameters, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, cholesterol levels and β-secretase (BACE) protein levels) in mice. Adult Swiss mice received STZ [150 μg/bilateral, i.c.v.], and treated daily with probucol (≅10 mg/kg/day, in drinking water, for 5 weeks,). Twenty-one days after i.c.v. administrations, STZ-infused animals displayed significant deficits in cognition (evaluated in the displaced and new object recognition tasks), which were paralleled by a significant increase in hippocampal AChE activity. Moreover, STZ-infused mice showed increased levels of BACE and decreased glutathione reductase (GR) activity in the hippocampus compared with the control group. Probucol treatment significantly protected against the behavioral and hippocampal biochemical changes induced by STZ. However, it was unable to prevent STZ-induced increase of hippocampal BACE levels and did not change hippocampal cholesterol levels. It is noteworthy that probucol treatment increased the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity per se independent of STZ injection. The present findings are the first to show that i.c.v. STZ infusions are able to increase hippocampal BACE expression. Moreover, the results also show that probucol can counteract STZ-induced cognitive impairments and biochemical parameters independently of potential modulator effects toward BACE levels. The study is the first to report the protective effects of probucol against STZ-induced biochemical hippocampal changes and behavioral impairments, rendering this compound a promising molecule for further pharmacological studies on the search for therapeutic strategies to treat or prevent AD."

            "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease with a median survival of 3-4 years from time of initial diagnosis, similar to the time course of many malignancies. A hallmark of IPF is its unpredictable disease course, ranging from long periods of clinical stability to acute exacerbations with rapid decompensation. As the disease progresses, patients with chronic cough and progressive exertional dyspnea become oxygen dependent. They may experience significant distress due to concurrent depression, anxiety, and fatigue, which often lead to increased symptom burden and decreased quality of life. Despite these complications, palliative care is an underutilized, and often underappreciated, resource before end-of-life care in this population. While there is growing recognition about early palliative care in IPF, current data suggest referral patterns vary widely based on institutional practices. In addition to focusing on symptom management, there is emphasis on supplemental oxygen use, pulmonary rehabilitation, quality of life, and end-of-life care. Importantly, increased use of support groups and national foundation forums have served as venues for further disease education, communication, and advanced care planning outside of the hospital settings. The purpose of this review article is to discuss the clinical features of IPF, the role of palliative care in chronic disease management, current data supporting benefits of palliative care in IPF, its role in symptom management, and practices to help patients and their caregivers achieve their best quality of life."

[Results] At the end of inpatient rehabilitation, significant improvement was observed in reduction the TUG time, physical function, and handgrip strength, as well as in subjective parameters such as self-reported pain intensity, well-being, and functional status. [Conclusion] Our results show the high efficacy of inpatient rehabilitation as a means of improving functional independence. Hospital rehabilitation should be recommended for elderly people, not only in cases of absolute indications for hospital admission, but also periodically for patients at risk of physical disability."

            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common life-limiting illness with significant burden for patient and carer. Despite this, access to supportive and specialist palliative care is inconsistent and implementation of published good practice recommendations may be challenging within current resources. The aim of this service development was to improve local service provision in Barnsley, within the currently available resources, for patients with very severe COPD, to improve patient identification and symptom management, increase advance care planning and the numbers of patients dying in their preferred place, and increase patient and carer support and satisfaction. To do this a working group was formed, the service problems identified and baseline data collected to identify the needs of people with very severe COPD. A multidisciplinary team meeting was piloted and assessed by community matron feedback, patient case studies and an after death analysis. These indicated a high level of satisfaction, with improvements in advance care planning, co-ordination of management and support for patients' preferred place of care at the end of life. In conclusion this is the first reported very severe COPD service development established in this way and within current resources. Preliminary data indicates the development of the multidisciplinary team meeting has been positive. The appointment of a coordinator will aid this development. Further evaluations particularly seeking patient views and estimations of cost savings will be performed."

            "abstract": "Beyond respiratory impairment, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often suffer from comorbidities which are associated with worse health status, higher health care costs and worse prognosis. Reported prevalences of comorbidities largely differ between studies which might be explained by different assessment methods (objective assessment, self-reported assessment, or assessment by medical records), heterogeneous study populations, inappropriate control groups, incomparable methodologies, etc. This narrative review demonstrates and further evaluates the variability in prevalence of several comorbidities in patients with COPD and control individuals and discusses several shortcomings and pitfalls which need to be considered when interpreting comorbidity data. Like in other chronic organ diseases, the accurate diagnosis and integrated management of comorbidities is a key for outcome in COPD. This review highlights that there is a need to move from the starting point of an established index disease towards the concept of the development of multimorbidity in the elderly including COPD as an important and highly prevalent pulmonary component."

This was a randomized pilot study (n=40 intervention [IG], n=40 usual care) involving new enrollees into PASSPORT who were >60 years old. This was an in-home interdisciplinary chronic illness care management intervention by PASSPORT care managers collaborating with a hospital-based geriatrics/palliative care specialist team and the consumer's primary care physician. This pilot was not powered to test hypotheses; instead, it was hypothesis generating. Primary outcomes measured symptom control, mood, decision making, spirituality, and quality of life. Little difference was seen in primary outcomes; however, utilization favored the IG. At 12 months, the IG had fewer hospital visits (50% vs. 55%, P=0.65) and fewer nursing facility admissions (22.5% vs. 32.5%, P=0.32). Using hospital-based specialists interfacing with a community agency to provide a team-based approach to care of consumers with chronic illnesses was found to be feasible. Lack of change in symptom control or quality of life outcome measures may be related to the tools used, as these were validated in populations closer to the end of life.

In this post-hoc analysis, we investigated the impact of anesthesia type on clinical outcomes in patients included in SWIFT PRIME trial. Methods: Ninety-seven patients treated with MT were included. Patients treated in centers with general anesthesia (GA) policy (n = 32) were compared with those treated in centers with conscious sedation (CS) policy (n = 65). Primary outcomes studied included times to treatment initiation (TTI), rates of successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3), and functional independence (mRS 0-2 at 90 days). Secondary outcomes were adverse events, lowest systolic and diastolic blood pressures (LSBP and LDBP) during MT. Univariate analysis and multivariate regression logistic modeling were conducted. Results: The GA-policy and CS-policy groups presented comparable TTI (94 ± 36 min vs. 102 ± 48 min; p = 0.44), rates of TICI 2b/3 recanalization (22/32 [68.8%] vs. 51/65 [78.5%]; p = 0.32). CS-policy was associated to higher rate of functional independence than GA-policy, but the difference was not significant (43/65 [66.2%] vs. 16/32 [50.0%]; p = 0.18). GA-policy patients had a higher rate of postoperative pneumonia (11/32 [34.4%] vs. 8/65 [12.3%]; p = 0.02) and lower LSBP (110 [30,160] mmHg vs. 119 [77,170] mmHg; p = 0.03) and LDBP (55 (15,75) mmHg vs. 67 [40,121]; p < 0.001). When corrected for differences in baseline characteristics, GA-policy was associated with lower rate of functional independence (OR 0.32; p = 0.05). A 10-point increase in perprocedural LDBP was associated with an increased likelihood of favorable outcome (OR 1.51; p = 0.01). Conclusions: GA-policy for MT presented comparable TTI and rates of successful revascularization to CS-policy. However, GA-policy was associated with lower rates of functional independence and with higher incidence of perprocedural hypotension and postoperative pneumonia.

Presenting clinical phenotypes include corticobasal syndrome (CBS), frontal behavioral spatial syndrome, aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome (PSPS), and a predominantly cognitive phenotype often mistaken for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Treatment of CBD is symptomatic, particularly given recently negative neuroprotective studies. Given the relentless progression in CBD, all interested patients should be offered the opportunity to enroll in clinical neuroprotective trials as they arise. For symptomatic therapy, treatment options are necessarily based on evidence from other disorders given the lack of studies in CBD. In patients with CBS and PSPS, parkinsonism is treated with levodopa/carbidopa. This generally has modest and transient benefits at best and often results in no improvement. Botulinum toxin injections are the treatment of choice for limb dystonia. Clonazepam and levetiracetam are commonly used for myoclonus. Physical therapy is an important part of motor treatment, particularly for fall prevention strategies and assist device assessment. Whether medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine have any role in CBD is unclear given the various responses described in related phenotypes and diseases. Treating the behavioral symptoms associated with CBD is critical in an attempt to treat symptoms for which we have good pharmacologic interventions and to hopefully improve quality of life. General supportive care is important, including assessing for sores related to dystonia or immobility, monitoring dysphagia, and identifying needs for support services. Finally, as with other relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative diseases, it is critical to provide family and caregiver support and to assess for when palliative care services will serve the patient best."

We report a case of PCP in a 59-year-old man with a past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease treated with formoterol and a moderate daily dose of inhaled budesonide. He had also advanced stage non-small lung cancer treated with concurrent chemo-radiation with a cisplatin-etoposide containing regimen. The diagnosis of PCP was suspected based on the context of rapidly increasing dyspnea, lymphopenia and the imaging findings. Polymerase chain reaction testing on an induced sputum specimen was positive for Pneumocystis jirovecii. The patient was treated with oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and systemic corticotherapy and had showed clinical and radiological improvement. Six months after the PCP diagnosis, he developed a malignant pleural effusion and expired on hospice care. Through this case, we remind the importance of screening for PCP in lung cancer patients under chemotherapeutic regimens and with increasing dyspnea. In addition, we alert to the fact that long-term inhaled corticosteroids may be a risk factor for PCP in patients with lung cancer. Despite intensive treatment, the mortality of PCP remains high, hence the importance of chemoprophylaxis should be considered."

We investigated the incidence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes of AKI caused by palliative chemotherapy in lung cancer patients. Materials and Methods: Between January 2005 and November 2014, 207 lung cancer patients who had been treated with first-line palliative chemotherapy were enrolled. Renal function was assessed during every cycle of chemotherapy. AKI was defined based on changes in serum creatinine levels as described in the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines. Clinical outcomes were evaluated depending on AKI occurrence during the first-line chemotherapy. Results: Of the 207 patients, 36 (17.4%) experienced AKI. Among the 36 patients who developed AKI during chemotherapy, 33 (91.8%) had AKI stage I. Although 19 patients (52.7%) with AKI during chemotherapy progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD), no patients were reported to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The number of chemotherapy cycles was independently associated with chemotherapy-induced AKI in multivariate analysis (OR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.29-2.26, p < 0.001).

For all drugs, the positive benefit/risk ratio is decreasing/inverted in correlation to very old age, comorbidity, dementia, frailty and limited life-expectancy (VOCODFLEX). Main obstacles to routine deprescribing are emotional/psychological myths; patient-doctor interactions are expected to be transformed into prescription; doctors are perceived as expert prescribers who wisely choose the right medication/s to treat all diseases. Although most 'guidelines' were not proven in older people, particularly VOCODFLEX, doctors are afraid of lawsuits and of the patient/family reaction if they do not follow all experts' recommendations. Doctors are frustrated facing uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of strategies to reduce polypharmacy and the lack of EBM indicating when to de-prescribe. When explicit criteria and 'drugs to avoid' are used alone, we may disregard undiagnosed harms imposed by the remaining drug groups and interactions. The best approaches are implicit tools that take into consideration EBM data, clinical circumstances and medical judgement.

Patients with MF develop splenomegaly (due to extramedullary hematopoiesis), hypercatabolic symptoms (due to overexpression of inflammatory cytokines), and anemia (due to bone marrow failure and splenic sequestration). MF remains curable only with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), a therapy that few MF patients are deemed fit to undergo. The goals of treatment are thus often palliative. The approval of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib has done much to address the burden of splenomegaly and constitutional symptoms of patients with MF; however, therapy-related anemia is often an anticipated downside. Anemia thus remains a challenge in the management of MF and represents a major unmet need. Intractable anemia depresses quality of life, portends poor outcomes, and can act to restrict access to palliative JAK inhibition in some patients. While therapies for MF-related anemia do exist, they are limited in their efficacy, durability, and tolerability. Therapies currently in development promise improved anemia-specific outcomes; however, are still early in the pathway to regulatory approval and regular clinical use. In this review, we will discuss established and emerging treatments for MF-related anemia. We will give particular attention to developmental therapies which herald significant progress in the understanding and management of MF-related anemia."

            "abstract": "Memantine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist utilized as a palliative cure for Alzheimer's disease. This is the second study examining the memantine concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. The previously published study enrolled six patients, and three of them were theoretically in a steady state. In our study, we enrolled 22 patients who regularly used a standard therapeutic dose of memantine (20 mg/day, oral administration) before the sample collection. Patients were divided into four groups, according to the time of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid collection: 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after memantine administration. The cerebrospinal fluid samples were also assessed for selected oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine, glutathione, non-protein thiols, and non-protein disulfides). The plasma/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ratio for all time intervals were within the range of 45.89% (6 h) to 55.60% (18 h), which corresponds with previously published findings in most patients. The other aim of our study was to deduce whether the achieved \"real\" memantine concentration in the central compartment was sufficient to block NMDA receptors. The IC50 value of memantine as an NMDA antagonist is in micromolar range; the lowest limit is 112 ng/ml (GluN2C), and this value was achieved only in three cases. The memantine cerebrospinal fluid concentration did not reach one quarter of the IC50 value in five cases (one patient was excluded for noncompliance); therefore, the potency of memantine as a therapeutic effect in patients may be questionable. However, it appears that memantine therapy positively affected the levels of some oxidative stress parameters, especially non-protein thiols and 3-nitrotyrosine."

Death of personality, of memory, and of physical skills wears away the fabric of relationships, leaving little hope of any return to normalcy. To some, this reflection exhibits how faith sustains hope and comforts those afflicted, despite the odds of inevitable loss. To others it reflects upon the poignant complexities associated with palliative care and the demand for individualized attention to the beliefs, norms, and values of each situation, no matter the culture, religion, age, or race. No two cases are ever the same in the face of death, yet for those who experience it, all must appreciate how difficult, unique, personal, and memorable such moments can be."

We assessed the effectiveness of early palliative care integrated with respiratory services for patients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness.\n## METHODS\nIn this single-blind randomised trial, we enrolled consecutive adults with refractory breathlessness and advanced disease from three large teaching hospitals and via general practitioners in South London. We randomly allocated (1:1) patients to receive either a breathlessness support service or usual care. Randomisation was computer generated centrally by the independent Clinical Trials Unit in a 1:1 ratio, by minimisation to balance four potential confounders: cancer versus non-cancer, breathlessness severity, presence of an informal caregiver, and ethnicity. The breathlessness support service was a short-term, single point of access service integrating palliative care, respiratory medicine, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. Research interviewers were masked as to which patients were in the treatment group. Our primary outcome was patient-reported breathlessness mastery, a quality of life domain in the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, at 6 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat. Survival was a safety endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01165034.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Oct 22, 2010 and Sept 28, 2012, 105 consenting patients were randomly assigned (53 to breathlessness support service and 52 to usual care). 83 of 105 (78%) patients completed the assessment at week 6. Mastery in the breathlessness support service group improved compared with the control (mean difference 0·58, 95% CI 0·01-1·15, p=0·048; effect size 0·44). Sensitivity analysis found similar results. Survival rate from randomisation to 6 months was better in the breathlessness support service group than in the control group (50 of 53 [94%] vs 39 of 52 [75%]) and in overall survival (generalised Wilcoxon 3·90, p=0·048). Survival differences were significant for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease but not cancer.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe breathlessness support service improved breathlessness mastery. Our findings provide robust evidence to support the early integration of palliative care for patients with diseases other than cancer and breathlessness as well as those with cancer. The improvement in survival requires further investigation.\n## FUNDING\nUK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Cicely Saunders International.\n"

            "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic respiratory illness with a myriad of disabling symptoms and a decline in the functional parameters that affect the quality of life. The mortality and morbidity associated with severe COPD is high and the patients are mostly housebound and in need of continuous care and support. The uncertain nature of its prognosis makes the commencement of palliative care and discussion of end-of-life issues difficult even in the advanced stage of the disease. This is often compounded by inadequate communication and counseling with patients and their relatives. The areas that may improve the quality of care include the management of dyspnea, oxygen therapy, nutritional support, antianxiety, and antidepressant treatment, and advance care planning. Hence, it is necessary to pursue a holistic care approach for palliative care services along with disease-specific medical management in all such patients to improve the quality of life in end-stage COPD."

The rising incidence, genetic heterogeneity, multiple etiologies, and concurrent chronic liver diseases make diagnosis, staging, and selection of treatment options challenging in patients with HCC. The best approach to optimize the management of HCC is one that utilizes a core multidisciplinary liver tumor board, consisting of hepatologists, pathologists, interventional radiologists, oncologists, hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, nurses, and general practitioners. In most cases, HCC is diagnosed by abdominal imaging studies, preferably with a triphasic computed tomography scan of the abdomen or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. Histopathological diagnosis using a guided liver biopsy may be needed in noncirrhotic patients or when radiological diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled in the setting of cirrhosis. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system facilitates a standardized therapeutic strategy based on the tumor burden, extent of metastasis, severity of hepatic decompensation, comorbid medical illnesses, functional status of patient, HCC-related symptoms, and preference of the patient. Treatment options include curative surgery (hepatic resection and liver transplantation) and palliative measures (radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and chemotherapy with sorafenib). The role of the multidisciplinary team is crucial in promptly reconfirming the diagnosis, staging the HCC, and formulating an individualized treatment plan. In potential liver transplant candidates, timely liver transplant evaluation and coordinating bridging/downsizing treatment modalities, such as radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization, can be time-consuming. In summary, a multidisciplinary team approach provides a timely, individualized treatment plan, which can vary from curative surgery in patients with early-stage HCC to palliative/hospice care in patients with metastatic HCC. In most tertiary care centers in the US, a multidisciplinary liver tumor board has become the standard of care and a key component of best practice protocol for patients with HCC."

Common urinary disorders that are seen in older dogs include chronic renal failure, urinary incontinence, bladder tumors, and prostate problems. Therapy for chronic renal failure is aimed at both slowing the progression of the disease and ameliorating the signs of uremia. Therapeutic recommendations for the conservative medical management of chronic renal failure include reducing dietary protein, moderately reducing salt intake, maintaining normal serum phosphorus levels, providing free access to water, avoiding stress, supplementing water soluble vitamins, using anabolic steroids to treat the anemia of chronic renal failure, treating acidosis, and controlling hypocalcemia. Urinary incontinence can often be controlled or eliminated. The appropriate approach to management of this disorder is to identify and remove specific causes. Common causes of urinary incontinence are urethral incompetence, urinary tract infection, and polyuria and polydypsia. Bladder tumors are, fortunately, not a common tumor of dogs, but are more common in geriatric dogs than in the young. The most common bladder tumor is the transitional cell carcinoma. Therapy for this tumor is usually palliative because of its malignant nature and because it is usually located in the neck of the bladder. Its location in the bladder often makes it impossible to resect the tumor completely without removing the entire bladder and diverting the ureters. New chemotherapeutic modalities are being evaluated that may increase life expectancy after diagnosis and, therefore, improve prognosis. Prostate disease is also seen in older dogs. Types of prostate abnormalities seen in dogs include prostatic hyperplasia, cysts, abscesses, acute and chronic infection, and neoplasia. The institution of proper therapy requires an accurate diagnosis; neutering is often recommended as a part of therapy regardless of the type of prostatic disease present."

A palliative approach; that is an approach to care which seeks to ease burdensome symptoms without attempting curative treatment, has been suggested as the most appropriate framework for addressing the needs of these people.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The overall objective was to establish best practice in relation to palliative care for people with advanced dementia in terms of effectiveness and appropriateness.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished English language studies, published between 1997 and 2009. A three-step search strategy was utilised in each component of this review.\n    \n\n\n          Critical appraisal:\n        \n      \n      Quantitative, qualitative and discursive text articles were included in this review. Articles were assessed for congruence to the review criteria and then critically appraised for quality using the appropriate JBI tool.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Data were extracted using the appropriate JBI data extraction tool for each methodology. No quantitative meta-analysis was possible due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. Qualitative synthesis was performed with the JBI QARI tool. Discursive textual synthesis was performed with the JBI NOTARI tool.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Quantitative studies recommended the use of do not resuscitate, do not hospitalise orders and other forms of advance directives to prevent interventions unwanted by the patient and/or their family. Feeding tubes and the use of intravenous antibiotics were not found to be an effective intervention. Interventions designed to treat the burdensome symptoms of advanced dementia (such as pain and agitation) were found to be of the most benefit to patients.Qualitative analysis found it distressing for families to discuss or plan for, a poor quality of life for their loved one during the process of dying. Decisions concerned with palliative treatment for the person with advanced dementia were found to be complicated by knowledge differences, lack of understanding of the disease trajectory of dementia, the unpredictable nature of dementia itself and religious and socio-economical issues. Textual analysis found that a palliative approach to end of life care in advanced dementia is both appropriate and effective in terms of benefit to patients and their significant others.Despite the large volume of data retrieved and analysed for this review, no studies examining the role of case-conferencing for managing the introduction of palliative care or managing a palliative approach met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review.\n    \n\n\n          Implications for practice:\n        \n      \n      IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH: There is a need for further studies in the area of palliation and advanced dementia, particularly high quality studies investigating palliative care case conferencing and other methods of arranging and planning end of life care for people with dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There is some evidence to suggest that a palliative approach is both effective and appropriate for use with people who have advanced dementia. There is no evidence for or against the use of case-conferencing as a method of arranging care for people with advanced dementia."

We aimed to design and evaluate a prognostic screening tool to routinely identify inpatients with decompensated cirrhosis at high risk of dying over the coming year, alongside the development of a supportive care intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Clinical notes from consecutive patients admitted as an emergency to University Hospitals Bristol with a diagnosis of cirrhosis over two distinct 90-day periods were scrutinised retrospectively for the presence or absence of five evidence-based factors associated with poor prognosis. These were analysed against their ability to predict mortality at 1 year. 'Plan-Do-Study-Act' (PDSA) methodology was used to incorporate poor-prognosis screening into the routine assessment of patients admitted with cirrhosis, and develop a supportive care intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      73 admissions were scrutinised (79.5% male, 63% alcohol-related liver disease, median age 54).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Typically, dementia involves progressive cognitive and functional deterioration, leading to death. A palliative approach recognizes the inevitable health decline, focusing on quality of life. The approach is holistic, proactive, supports the client and the family, and can be provided by the client's usual care team.In the last months of life, distressing symptoms, support needs, and care transitions may escalate. This project trialed a strategy intended to support a consistent, high quality, palliative approach for people with dementia drawing close to death. The strategy was to implement two communities of practice, drawn primarily from service provider organizations across care sectors, supporting them to address practice change. Communities comprised practitioners and other health professionals with a passionate commitment to dementia palliative care and the capacity to drive practice enhancement within partnering organizations.Project aims were to document: (i) changes driven by the communities of practice; (ii) changes in staff/practitioner characteristics during the study (knowledge of a palliative approach and dementia; confidence delivering palliative care; views on death and dying, palliative care, and a palliative approach for dementia); (iii) outcomes from perspectives of family carers, care providers, and community of practice members; (iv) the extent to which changes enhanced practice and care continuity; and (v) barriers to and facilitators of successful community of practice implementation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This action research project was implemented over 14 months in 2010/11 in metropolitan Perth, Western Australia and regional Launceston, Tasmania. Each state based community of practice worked with the researchers to scope existing practice and its outcomes. The research team compiled a report of existing practice recommendations and resources. Findings of these two steps informed community of practice action plans and development of additional resources. Change implementation was recorded and explored in interviews, comparisons being made with practice recommendations. Changes in staff/practitioner characteristics were evaluated using survey data. Findings from semi structured interviews and survey administration established outcomes from perspectives of family carers, care providers, and community of practice members. Consideration of processes and outcomes, across the two state based settings, informed identification of barriers and facilitators. Community of practice reflections also informed study recommendations."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nLittle is known about the use of palliative care for outpatients who continue to pursue treatment of their underlying disease or whether outpatient palliative medicine consultation teams improve clinical outcomes.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a year-long controlled trial involving 50 intervention patients and 40 control patients in a general medicine outpatient clinic. Primary care physicians referred patients with advanced congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer who had a prognosis ranging from 1 to 5 years. In the intervention group, the primary care physicians received multiple palliative care team consultations, and patients received advance care planning, psychosocial support, and family caregiver training. Clinical and health care utilization outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months.\n## RESULTS\nGroups were similar at baseline. Similar numbers of patients died during the study year (P =.63). After the intervention, intervention group patients had less dyspnea (P =.01) and anxiety (P =.05) and improved sleep quality (P =.05) and spiritual well-being (P =.007), but no change in pain (P =.41), depression (P =.28), quality of life (P =.43), or satisfaction with care (P =.26). Few patients received recommended analgesic or antidepressant medications. Intervention patients had decreased primary care (P =.03) and urgent care visits (P =.04) without an increase in emergency department visits, specialty clinic visits, hospitalizations, or number of days in the hospital. There were no differences in charges (P =.80).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nConsultation by a palliative medicine team led to improved patient outcomes in dyspnea, anxiety, and spiritual well-being, but failed to improve pain or depression. Palliative care for seriously ill outpatients can be effective, but barriers to implementation must be explored.\n"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Advance care planning (ACP) enables patients to consider, discuss and, if they wish, document their wishes and preferences for future care, including decisions to refuse treatment, in the event that they lose capacity to make decisions for themselves. ACP is a key component of UK health policy to improve the experience of death and dying for patients and their families. There is limited evidence about how patients and health professionals understand ACP, or when and how this is initiated. It is evident that many people find discussion of and planning for end of life care difficult, and tend to avoid the topic.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To investigate how patients, their relatives and health professionals initiate and experience discussion of ACP and the outcomes of advance discussions in shaping care at the end of life.\n    \n\n\n          Design and data collection:\n        \n      \n      Qualitative study with two workstreams: (1) interviews with 37 health professionals (general practitioners, specialist nurses and community nurses) about their experiences of ACP; and (2) longitudinal case studies of 21 patients with 6-month follow-up. Cases included a patient and, where possible, a nominated key relative and/or health professional as well as a review of medical records. Complete case triads were obtained for 11 patients. Four cases comprised the patient alone, where respondents were unable or unwilling to nominate either a family member or a professional carer they wished to include in the study. Patients were identified as likely to be within the last 6 months of life. Ninety-seven interviews were completed in total.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      General practices and community care settings in the East Midlands of England.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The study found ACP to be uncommon and focused primarily on specific documented tasks involving decisions about preferred place of death and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, supporting earlier research. There was no evidence of ACP in nearly half (9 of 21) of patient cases. Professionals reported ACP discussions to be challenging. It was difficult to recognise when patients had entered the last year of life, or to identify their readiness to consider future planning. Patients often did not wish to do so before they had become gravely ill. Consequently, ACP discussions tended to be reactive, rather than pre-emptive, occurring in response to critical events or evidence of marked deterioration. ACP discussions intersected two parallel strands of planning: professional organisation and co-ordination of care; and the practical and emotional preparatory work that patients and families undertook to prepare themselves for death. Reference to ACP as a means of guiding decisions for patients who had lost capacity was rare.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Advance care planning remains uncommon, is often limited to documentation of a few key decisions, is reported to be challenging by many health professionals, is not welcomed by a substantial number of patients and tends to be postponed until death is clearly imminent. Current implementation largely ignores the purpose of ACP as a means of extending personal autonomy in the event of lost capacity.\n    \n\n\n          Future work:\n        \n      \n      Attention should be paid to public attitudes to death and dying (including those of culturally diverse and ethnic minority groups), place of death, resuscitation and the value of anticipatory planning. In addition the experiences and needs of two under-researched groups should be explored: the frail elderly, including those who manage complex comorbid conditions, unrecognised as vulnerable cases; and those patients affected by stigmatised conditions, such as substance abuse or serious mental illness who fail to engage constructively with services and are not recognised as suitable referrals for palliative and end of life care.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme."

Our final dataset comprised 92 interviews (23 conducted with patient and informal carer together). Severe symptoms that caused major disruption to normal life were described, often in terms implying acceptance of the situation as a \"way of life\" rather than an \"illness.\" Patients and their informal carers adapted to and accepted the debilitating symptoms of a lifelong condition. Professional carers' familiarity with the patients' condition, typically over many years, and prognostic uncertainty contributed to the difficulty of recognising and actively managing end stage disease. Overall, patients told a \"chaos narrative\" of their illness that was indistinguishable from their life story, with no clear beginning and an unanticipated end described in terms comparable with attitudes to death in a normal elderly population.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings challenge current assumptions underpinning provision of end of life care for people with COPD. The policy focus on identifying a time point for transition to palliative care has little resonance for people with COPD or their clinicians and is counter productive if it distracts from early phased introduction of supportive care. Careful assessment of possible supportive and palliative care needs should be triggered at key disease milestones along a lifetime journey with COPD, in particular after hospital admission for an exacerbation."

However, more rarely, hemophilia can be acquired. Our paper focuses on acquired hemophilia A (AHA), which is caused by the development of an autoantibody (an inhibitor) to factor VIII. A 61-year-old man with a past medical history of type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and obstructive sleep apnea presented to the emergency department with severe right lower extremity pain and swelling of 2-day duration. He was found to have compartment syndrome and underwent emergent fasciotomy of his right leg. After surgery he still had significant bleeding, despite transfusions and administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) by the surgical team. He was later diagnosed with AHA, but was not adequately responsive to factor VII, factor VIII, steroids nor rituxan and unfortunately had his right lower extremity amputated. He had a prolonged hospital course, which included Streptococcus bovis bacteremia and a code stroke for which head computed tomography (CT) showed probable metastasis. It was acknowledged he had probable metastatic colon cancer, which was not confirmed as the patient transitioned to hospice care. Rather than hemarthrosis, patients with AHA tend to have bleeding in soft tissue or the gastrointestinal tract. AHA can have underlying causes, such as malignancy. AHA associated with malignancy is associated with poorer outcomes and tends to improve with treatment of the underlying malignancy. Therefore, it is important to quickly identify these patients and screen them for underlying etiologies."

            "abstract": "Maintaining adequate quality of life (QoL) is an important therapeutic objective for patients with advanced heart failure and, for some patients, may take precedence over prolonging life. Achieving good QoL in this context may involve aspects of patient care that lie outside the familiar limits of heart failure treatment. The inodilator levosimendan may be advantageous in this setting, not least because of its sustained duration of action, ascribed to a long-acting metabolite designated OR-1896. The possibility of using this drug in an outpatient setting is a notable practical advantage that avoids the need for patients to attend a clinic appointment. Intermittent therapy can be integrated into a wider system of outreach and patient monitoring. Practical considerations in the use of levosimendan as part of a palliative or end-of-life regimen focused on preserving QoL include the importance of starting therapy at low doses and avoiding bolus administration unless immediate effects are required and patients have adequate baseline arterial blood pressure."

These patients and their families can benefit from the psychosocial and decision-making support of a palliative care consultation. Objective: We aim to investigate the characteristics and impact of palliative care consultation for patients under the management of neurosurgical and critical care services with a devastating brain injury in a neurological intensive care unit (ICU) at a large tertiary-care hospital. Design: Data were collected by retrospective review of the electronic medical record and metrics collected by the palliative care service. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess effect of timing of palliative care consultation. Results: Fifty-five patients admitted to the neurological ICU under the management of the neurosurgical service received a palliative care consultation for the following: hemorrhagic stroke (49%), metastatic cancer (22%), and traumatic brain injury (18%). Of these, 73% had at least one neurosurgical intervention. Palliative care was most frequently consulted for assistance in defining a patient's goals of care (88%). When compared with late consultation, early palliative care consultation was significantly associated with shorter mean length of stay (LOS) and positively correlated in linear regression analysis without an effect on mortality. Conclusions: When compared with a late consultation, early palliative care consultation corresponded to shorter LOS without increasing mortality. One reason for this effect may be that palliative care can help to clarify and document goals of care earlier and more concretely."

The mainstay of treatment is drug therapy, complemented by comprehensive rehabilitation, invasive procedures, palliative treatment and monitoring. While sufficient health economic evidence exists on the cost-effectiveness of certain standard drugs, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers, little or no information exists on the cost effectivty of diuretics or aldosterone antagonists. Recently, introduced treatment strategies such as ventricular assistance devices or telemonitoring have yet to be evaluated for their cost-effectiveness in terms of risk of hospitalization, life expectancy and quality of life. With respect to the aging population and the drastically increasing costs of healthcare for heart failure patients, the goal is a more conscious and cost-effective resource allocation. This can help reduce the incidence of over and under treatment, diminish side effects and consequently improve symptoms, quality of life and life expectancy in the affected population. Further clinical trials and health economic analyses are necessary to optimize recommendations for healthcare of patients with chronic heart failure."

These patients tend to have multiple co-morbidities such as end stage renal disease and are considered high-risk for surgery. In patients with severe coronary artery disease, severe aortic stenosis, and heart failure with depressed left ventricular systolic function, the options are limited as they are not usually offered surgery, but palliative percutaneous high-risk procedures might be a viable alternative.Though long term results after balloon aortic valvuolpasty are not promising, there is a role for these procedures in high-risk inoperable patients for either palliation or as a bridge to surgery. Unprotected left main percutaneous interventions are also feasible with low complication rates. This review provides mounting evidence that it is reasonable to perform combined palliative balloon aortic valvuolpasty and high-risk coronary artery stenting in certain inoperable patients. An illustrative case is presented that extends the findings of the current literature and demonstrates that combined balloon aortic valvuolpasty and left main stenting could be a safe and effective alternative in the setting of heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and end stage renal disease."

Neurologists are often viewed as consulting physicians; however, patients living with chronic neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis, dementia, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or sequelae of stroke often consider their neurologist as one of their primary physicians. Therefore, neurologists are positioned in both the outpatient and inpatient care settings not only to address symptoms referable to the disease but also to improve overall quality of life for patients and caregivers and to facilitate end-of-life care."

As anxiety is itself emerging as a risk factor for cognitive decline and dementia, the primary question of the present study is whether an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention can significantly reduce anxiety symptoms in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The secondary questions pertain to whether such changes extend to other domains of psychological, social, and biological functioning (including cognition, self-regulation, lifestyle, well-being and quality of life, sleep, and selected blood-based biomarkers) associated with mental health, older age, and risk for dementia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      SCD-Well is a multicenter, observer-blinded, randomized, controlled, superiority trial, which is part of the Horizon 2020 European Union-funded \"Medit-Ageing\" project. SCD-Well compares an 8-week mindfulness- and compassion-based intervention specifically adapted for older adults with SCD with a validated 8-week health education program. Participants were recruited from memory clinics in four European sites (Cologne, Germany; London, United Kingdom; Barcelona, Spain; and Lyon, France) and randomized with a 1:1 allocation, stratified by site.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcome, change in anxiety symptoms, and secondary outcomes reflecting psychological, cognitive, social, and biological functioning are assessed at baseline, postintervention, and 4 months after the end of the intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The study will provide evidence on whether a mindfulness-based intervention can effect changes in anxiety and other risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia in older adults with SCD and will inform the establishment of intervention strategies targeted at improving mental health in older adults."

            "abstract": "This feature article for the thematic series on congestive heart failure (CHF) readmissions aims to outline important gaps in guidelines for patients with multiple comorbidities and the elderly. Congestive heart failure diagnosis manifests as a 3-phase journey between the hospital and community, during acute, chronic stable, and end-of-life (palliative) phases. This journey requires in variable intensities a combination of multidisciplinary care within tertiary hospital or ambulatory care from hospital outpatients or primary health services, within the general community. Management goals are uniform, ie, to achieve the lowest New York Heart Association class possible, with improvement in ejection fraction, by delivering gold standard therapies within a CHF program. Comorbidities are an important common denominator that influences outcomes. Comorbidities include diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airways disease, chronic renal impairment, hypertension, obesity, sleep apnea, and advancing age. Geriatric care includes the latter as well as syndromes such as frailty, falls, incontinence, and confusion. Many systems still fail to comprehensively achieve all aspects of such programs.

            "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by progressive loss of cognitive function, dementia and altered behavior. Over 30 million people worldwide suffer from AD and available therapies are still palliative rather than curative. Recently, Memoquin (MQ), a quinone-bearing polyamine compound, has emerged as a promising anti-AD lead candidate, mainly thanks to its multi-target profile. MQ acts as an acetylcholinesterase and β-secretase-1 inhibitor, and also possesses anti-amyloid and anti-oxidant properties. Despite this potential interest, in vivo behavioral studies with MQ have been limited. Here, we report on in vivo studies with MQ (acute and sub-chronic treatments; 7-15 mg/kg per os) carried out using two different mouse models: i) scopolamine- and ii) beta-amyloid peptide- (Aβ-) induced amnesia. Several aspects related to memory were examined using the T-maze, the Morris water maze, the novel object recognition, and the passive avoidance tasks. At the dose of 15 mg/kg, MQ was able to rescue all tested aspects of cognitive impairment including spatial, episodic, aversive, short and long-term memory in both scopolamine- and Aβ-induced amnesia models. Furthermore, when tested in primary cortical neurons, MQ was able to fully prevent the Aβ-induced neurotoxicity mediated by oxidative stress. The results support the effectiveness of MQ as a cognitive enhancer, and highlight the value of a multi-target strategy to address the complex nature of cognitive dysfunction in AD."

Recently, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been reported to be effective in relieving the pain of thalamic pain; however, the effect of SCS on gait performance in patients is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the gait performance before and after SCS in a case with thalamic pain. A 73-year-old male with thalamic pain participated in this study. We evaluated the gait of the patient two times: before SCS insertion and after 6 days of SCS. At the second evaluation, we measured the gait in three conditions: stimulation off, comfortable stimulation, and strong stimulation. SCS succeeded in improving the pain from 7 to 2 on an 11-point numerical rating scale. Step frequency and the velocity of gait tended to increase between pre- and poststimulation periods. There were no apparent differences in gait among the three stimulation conditions (off, comfortable, and strong) at the poststimulation period.

Presenting symptoms include dyspnoea (20), chest pain/tightness (7), oedema (5), constitutional symptoms (5), cough (3) and haemoptysis (3). Twelve patients were in group III/IV of the NYHA functional classification of symptoms. Initial CT scans were suggestive of thromboembolism in seven patients. Histological findings were of intimal sarcoma (13) and high grade sarcoma NOS (6). Median overall survival (OS) was 17 months. Fourteen patients underwent PEA to relieve vascular obstruction, while six had inoperable and/or metastatic disease. There were three peri-operative deaths. Although there was no difference in median OS between patients who had PEA and those who did not (20 vs 17 months, P = 0.2488), surgery provided significant symptomatic improvement and some with long-term survival. Five patients received post-surgical chemotherapy (anthracycline +/- ifosfamide), and after completion four also had radiotherapy. Patients who received post-operative chemo- and radio-therapy showed a trend towards better survival compared to those who had surgery alone (24 vs 8 months, P = 0.3417). For palliative chemotherapy, partial responses were observed with the VID regimen and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Stable disease was achieved in a patient with intimal sarcoma with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation on third-line cisplatin and topotecan.

No longer considered just for patients at end-of-life, palliative care is now being incorporated early in the disease trajectory. Despite professional guidelines supporting early palliative care, there are few models that have been created that can be translated into practice cross-culturally. In the United States, the Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before, Life Ends (ENABLE) early palliative care telehealth model has demonstrated effectiveness in improving quality of life, mood, symptom relief, and survival for patients with cancer and is now being tested in patients with heart failure. Family caregivers of patients who have received ENABLE concurrent with their care recipients have also demonstrated positive outcomes in quality of life and caregiver burden. Internationally, a number of investigators are culturally adapting ENABLE for patients and family caregivers. While some elements of ENABLE, such as symptom management and self-care, and the caregiving role are relevant cross-culturally, others have been built on Western principles of self-determination or represent concepts such as advance care planning which will require more cultural adaptation. In addition, ENABLE was initially an in-person approach that was converted to telehealth to accommodate a rural population-it will be important to understand cultural norms related to receiving care by phone or if an in-person approach will be more culturally acceptable. This paper describes efforts in Turkey and Singapore to culturally adapt the ENABLE early palliative care principles for their countries."

A partnership between nephrology and palliative care/hospice healthcare teams would seem likely in the care of ESRD patients, yet this is often not the case. In anticipation of increasing participation by palliative care/hospice teams in the care of such patients, this article reviews the decision-making process of withdrawal and the medical care of the patient who withdraws. While withdrawal can be an acceptable choice from a medical, legal, psychiatric, and ethical point of view, it can nonetheless be complex. Profound decisions are often characterized by the need for time to process, and by ambivalence among patient, family and healthcare providers. In addition to caring for the patient and family, the palliative care/hospice team will want to consider the needs of the referring nephrology team as well. A \"uremic death\" is characterized as painless; however, other symptoms related to the accumulation of toxins and fluid can be anticipated and managed. Pharmacological intervention of uremic symptoms, as well as the pain attendant to other, nonrenal comorbid disease is accomplished with awareness of the impact of renal failure on the excretion of various drugs and their metabolites."

Here, we present two contrasting cases to highlight the importance of early and ongoing involvement of palliative care in patients with ESKD. In the first case, a high quality of life was preserved before the patient died with dignity, with early interdisciplinary palliative care involvement. In the second case there was a long protracted period of poor quality of life prior to death. This was associated with resistance to the involvement of palliative care, mainly from the family.

Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is important in the mechanisms of hypoxia and intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis. As a well-established hypoxia-mimetic agent, CoCl2 stabilizes and increases the expression of hypoxia inducible factor‑1α (HIF-1α), which regulates several genes involved in pH balance, including NHE1. However, it is not fully understood whether NHE1 is activated in astrocytes under CoCl2 treatment. In the current study, pHi and NHE activity were analyzed using the pHi‑sensitive dye BCECF‑AM. Using cariporide (an NHE1‑specific inhibitor) and EIPA (an NHE nonspecific inhibitor), the current study demonstrated that it was NHE1, not the other NHE isoforms, that was important in regulating pHi homeostasis in astrocytes during CoCl2 treatment. Additionally, the present study observed that, during the early period of CoCl2 treatment (the first 2 h), NHE1 activity and pHi dropped immediately, and NHE1 mRNA expression was reduced compared with control levels, whereas expression levels of the NHE1 protein had not yet changed. In the later period of CoCl2 treatment, NHE1 activity and pHi significantly increased compared with the control levels, as did the mRNA and protein expression levels of NHE1. Furthermore, the cell viability and injury of astrocytes was not changed during the initial 8 h of CoCl2 treatment; their deterioration was associated with the higher levels of pHi and NHE1 activity. The current study concluded that NHE1 activity and pHi homeostasis are regulated by CoCl2 treatment in a time-dependent manner in astrocytes, and may be responsible for the changes in cell viability and injury observed under hypoxia-mimetic conditions induced by CoCl2 treatment."

Ninety-five percent practiced clinical nephrology (54/57). Of these, 51 completed the survey (55% completion rate), and their responses were analyzed. Sixty-four percent were in practice >10 years; 65% resided in the Southern USA. Ninety-two percent felt comfortable discussing EOL care, with no significant difference between those with ≤10 versus >10 years of practice experience (P = 0.28). Thirty-one percent reported referring patients to EOL care 'somewhat' or 'much less often' than indicated. The most frequent referral barriers were: time-consuming nature of EOL discussions (27%); difficulty in accurately determining prognosis for <6-month survival (35%); patient (63%) and family (71%) unwillingness; and patient (69%) and family (73%) misconceptions. Fifty-seven percent would refer more patients if dialysis or ultrafiltration could be performed in hospice.

Family physicians do not systematically assess non-acute care needs, and patients do not mention them or try to mask them from the family physician. This is embedded within a predominant perception among patients, nurses, and family physicians of the family physician as the person to appeal to in acute and standard follow-up situations rather than for palliative care needs.

CLINICAL FINDINGS Physical examination revealed a grade 5/6 right apical systolic heart murmur. Findings on thoracic radiography were consistent with moderate right and left ventricular enlargement, left atrial enlargement, and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries and veins; an interstitial pulmonary pattern was also evident. Echocardiography revealed a perimembranous VSD with left-to-right shunting combined with trace mitral valve regurgitation. The cat later developed a dry cough, the intensity of the heart murmur increased to grade 6/6, and signs of left-sided congestive heart failure developed. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME Medical treatment included enalapril maleate and furosemide. When the cat's condition worsened despite medical treatment, palliative pulmonary artery banding was performed. During surgery, blood pressure in the pulmonary artery was measured with a pulmonary artery catheter, and pulmonary artery banding was successfully achieved with a polytetrafluoroethylene band and hemoclips. The pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio was reduced from 3 to 1.5, and signs of congestive heart failure resolved within 2 weeks after surgery. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Findings suggested that cats with a VSD and pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio > 3 or with congestive heart failure attributable to a VSD could be considered candidates for palliative pulmonary artery banding to alleviate clinical signs. However, further investigation into long-term prognosis with objective outcome measurements and with multiple cases is needed. (J Am Vet Med Assoc 2019;254:723-727)."

            "abstract": "Hypoxia has been implicated in the pathology of the central nervous system during stroke. It also has a significant effect on the regulation of glucose transporters (GLUTs), and homeostasis between glucose uptake and consumption. CoCl2 is a hypoxia‑mimetic agent, and thus stabilizes the hypoxia‑inducible factor 1α (HIF‑1α) subunit and regulates GLUT genes. GLUT‑1 and GLUT‑3 are the most common isoforms of the GLUT family present in the brain, with the former primarily expressed in astrocytes and the latter in neurons under physiological conditions. However, it remains controversial whether GLUT‑3 is expressed in astrocytes. Additionally, it is unclear whether the regulation of GLUT‑1 and GLUT‑3, and glucose homeostasis, are affected by CoCl2 treatment in a time‑dependent manner. In the present study, mRNA and protein levels of GLUT‑1, GLUT‑3 and HIF‑1α in astrocytes were examined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis, respectively. The intracellular glucose concentration, glycogen storage, ATP content, pyruvate concentration, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release activity and cell viability in astrocytes were also investigated. The observations of the current study confirmed that both protein and mRNA levels of GLUT‑1 and GLUT‑3 were elevated in a time‑dependent manner induced by CoCl2 treatment, followed by accumulation of HIF‑1α. Furthermore, in the early period of CoCl2 treatment (≤8 h at 100 µM), LDH release, ATP content, glycogen storage and cell viability remained unchanged, whereas intracellular pyruvate concentration increased and glucose concentration was reduced. However, in the later period of CoCl2 treatment (>8 h at 100 µM), LDH release and intracellular pyruvate concentration increased, while intracellular glucose concentration, ATP content and glycogen storage were reduced. This may be due to disruption of homeostasis and reduced cell viability. In conclusion, alteration in the expression levels of GLUT‑1 and GLUT‑3, and the homeostasis between glucose uptake and consumption were affected by CoCl2 treatment, in a time‑dependent manner, and may result in reduced energy production and cell viability in astrocytes."

We included patients 65 years or older with heart failure, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cirrhosis, who were able to give informed consent and who spoke English This study was a randomized, prospective, clinical trial. The intervention group received a PMC on enrollment and every weekday during hospitalization. Four physicians shared PMC duties. The PMC physician saw intervention patients daily, routinely assessed symptoms and psychosocial and spiritual needs, discussed treatment preferences, and consulted a pharmacist and chaplain as needed. The PMC physician communicated findings and recommendations to the patient's team via a medical chart note and by telephone. The usual care group received a brief visit from the PMC physician who gave them a packet of information on diet and exercise. On admission, we used the Activities of Daily Living (ADL)7 and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales8 to categorize each subject as dependent or independent. Participants reporting the need for assistance with any 1 of 13 tasks were categorized as dependent. We used the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) to assess depression.9 Responses were scored 1 = “no” and “don't know” and 0 = “yes” and summed. Total scores of 6 or higher indicated the patient may be depressed. Pain, dyspnea, and anxiety were assessed daily by a research assistant who was blinded to group assignment and asked patients to rate each symptom at its worst level in the past 24 hours from 0 (“none”) to 10 (“the worst you can imagine”). Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. All patients completed a telephone survey 2 weeks after discharge to reassess symptoms, rate physician and nursing care, and recall discussions of preferences. We reviewed medical records to determine patients' primary diagnosis on admission. This study was undertaken between January 2002 and December 2003 and approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research. All participants gave written informed consent. Frequencies, means, and standard deviations were used to examine the distribution of measures. We used χ2 analysis to test for bivariate associations between categorical variables. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the impact of the intervention on symptom severity over different assessment periods. We used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Mac (version 17; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois; March 11, 2009). \n## Results\nWe enrolled 107 patients (intervention, n = 54; usual care, n = 53); 81 patients (76%; intervention, n = 41; usual care, n = 40) completed follow-up surveys. Most patients were male (62%) and white (71%) and had some college education (56%). The mean (SD) age was 76 (7.5) years, and 45% were married or partnered. The primary diagnoses were heart failure (51%; mean ejection fraction, 23%); cancer (22%; type: prostate, 22%; lung, 18%; and bladder, 13%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20%; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.5 L); and cirrhosis (6%; mean Model for Endstage Liver Disease score, 16). The mean (SD) hospital length of stay was 5.5 (5.8) days. Most participants were dependant in 1 or more ADL (71%), and 21% had a GDS-IS score of 6 or higher. The groups differed in mean age (77 and 74 years in the intervention and usual care groups, respectively; P = .007) but not in other characteristics. Symptom scores for all subjects improved from baseline to follow-up for pain (4.2 vs 2.3; P <.001), dyspnea (3.8 vs 2.0; P  <.001), and anxiety (4.8 vs 2.4; P <.001). There was no additional improvement in pain (P = .30), dyspnea (P = .50), or anxiety (P = .08) for patients assigned to the intervention at any assessment period (Figure). At follow-up, most patients believed that the staff understood what they were going through and that physicians and nurses listened to their hopes, fears, and beliefs (Table). However, a minority of patients reported that the physician discussed their preferences for care (43%), their chance of surviving hospitalization (42%), or their religious beliefs (31%).

            "abstract": "Today, more than two thirds of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are adults. Cardiac surgery plays an essential role in restoring and maintaining cardiac function, aside from evolving medical treatment and catheter-based interventions. The aim of the present publication was to describe the spectrum of operations performed on adults with CHD (ACHD) by reviewing current literature. Currently, surgery for ACHD is predominantly valve surgery, since valvular pathologies are often either a part of the basic heart defect or develop as sequelae of corrective or palliative surgery. Surgical techniques for valve repair, established in patients with acquired heart disease (non-ACHD), can often be transferred to ACHD. New valve substitutes may help to reduce the number of redo operations. Most of valve operations yield good results in terms of survival and quality of life, with the precondition that the ventricular function is preserved. Heart failure due to end-stage CHD is the most frequent cause of mortality in ACHD. However, surgical treatment by means of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is still uncommon and the mortality exceeds the one following other operations in ACHD. Currently, different devices are used and new technical developments are in progress. However, there still is no ideal assist device available. Therefore, heart transplantation remains the only valid option for end-stage CHD. Despite higher early mortality following heart transplantation in ACHD compared to non-ACHD, the long-term survival compares favorably to non-ACHD. There is room for improvement by refining the indications, the time of listing, and the perioperative care of ACHD transplant patients. Sudden death is the second most frequent cause of mortality in ACHD. Ventricular tachycardia is the most frequent cause of sudden death followed by coronary artery anomaly. Due to the increasing awareness of physicians and the improved imaging techniques, coronary artery anomalies are coming more into the focus of cardiac surgeons. However, the reported experience is limited and it is currently difficult to provide a standardized and generally applicable recommendation for the indication and the adequate surgical technique. With the increasing age and complexity of ACHD, treatment of rhythm disturbances by surgical ablation, pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation and resynchronisation gains importance. A risk score specifically designed for surgery in ACHD is among the newest developments in predicting the outcome of surgical treatment of ACHD. This evidence-based score, derived from and validated with data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database, enables comparison of risk-adjusted performance of the whole spectrum of procedures performed in ACHD and helps in understanding the differences in surgical outcomes. The score is thus a powerful tool for quality control and quality improvement. In conclusion, new developments in surgery for ACHD are currently made with regard to valve surgery, which comprises more than half of all operations in ACHD and in treatment of end-stage CHD, which still yields high mortality and morbidity."

Despite polypharmacy, participants said that morphine would be acceptable if it was monitored by a trusted healthcare professional. Many patients had experienced morphine before, often in life-threatening situations such as myocardial infarction, when it had helped greatly. Opioids were not strongly associated exclusively with death and dying (in contrast to patient reports in the cancer literature).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although some concerns about morphine were expressed, these did not appear to override a willingness to consider its use if recommended by a trusted clinician. However, some participants perceived that their doctor was concerned about its use, holding it as a last reserve. Morphine appears to be an acceptable breathlessness treatment option to these people with CHF. Prescribers may need education and reassurance if these medicines are to be used to their full potential and views may be different in other communities."

            "abstract": "The Royal College of Physicians and its Future Hospitals Commission has a renewed focus on general internal medicine. But in 2015, most is in effect either acute medicine or geriatric medicine. Acute physicians and 'organ specialists' looking after inpatients on specialty wards or at the acute hospital 'front door' will need sufficient skills in geriatric medicine, rehabilitation, discharge planning and palliative care, as frailty, dementia and complex comorbidities may complicate the care of older patients with predominant speciality-defining complaints. In an era where we are urged to focus on patient-centred care, patients' preference for continuity and 'whole-stay', consultants must be recognised and respected. Ideally, this will require increasing numbers of geriatricians and acute physicians, more age attuned training for all; a shift in values and status. This should be backed by adequate capacity and rapid access to social and intermediate care services outside hospital, as well as adequate multidisciplinary staff and skills within the acute hospital to ensure that older patients' needs beyond the immediate complaints are not neglected. Meanwhile, geriatric medicine itself has diversified into specialised, community and interface roles, aligned with the integration agenda, and continues to contribute substantially to acute, general and stroke medicine. These developments are described here."

The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize these responders. Demographics, lung function, anxiety (anxiety subscale of the 90-item symptom checklist (SCL-90-A)), depression (Beck depression inventory for primary care (BDI-PC)), exercise tolerance (six-minute walking distance test (6MWD)), and health status (Nijmegen clinical screening instrument (NCSI)) were assessed before and after a 12-week PR programme. Fatigue was assessed using the checklist individual strength (CIS)-Fatigue. Patients with a decline ≥ 10 points (minimally clinically important difference, MCID) on the CIS-Fatigue were defined as responders. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (n = 446, 61 ± 9 years, 53% male, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 43% ± 18% predicted, 75% severe fatigue) were included. Mean change in fatigue after PR was 10 ± 12 points (p < 0.01) and exceeded the MCID. In total, 56% were identified as fatigue responders. Baseline CIS-Fatigue (45 ± 7 vs. 38 ± 9 points, respectively, p < 0.001) and health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL; p < 0.001) were different between responders and non-responders. No differences were found in demographics, baseline anxiety, depression, lung function, 6MWD, and dyspnoea (p-values > 0.01). Responders on fatigue reported a greater improvement in anxiety, depression, 6MWD, dyspnoea (all p-values < 0.001), and most health status parameters. PR reduces fatigue in COPD. Responders on fatigue have worse fatigue and HRQoL scores at baseline, and are also likely to be responders on other outcomes of PR."

There is no evidence of how the experience of breathlessness differs across conditions. This paper compares the experience of breathlessness in cancer, COPD, heart failure and MND, four conditions sharing heavy symptom burdens, poor prognoses, high breathlessness rates and palliative care needs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For this qualitative study a purposive sample of 48 patients was included with a diagnosis of cancer (10), COPD (18), heart failure (10) or MND (10) and experiencing daily problems of breathlessness. Patients were recruited from the respective clinics at the hospital; specialist nurses' ward rounds and consultations, and \"Breathe Easy\" service users meetings in the community. Data were collected through semi-structured, in-depth interviews and participant observation. Breathlessness was compared according to six components derived from explanatory models and symptom schemata, first within groups and then across groups.

However there were differences between the four conditions, in the specific constraints of the illness and patients' experiences with the health care context and social environment. In cancer, breathlessness signalled the (possible) presence of cancer, and functioned as a reminder of patients' mortality despite the hopes they put in surgery, therapies and new drugs. For COPD patients, breathlessness was perceived as a self-inflicted symptom. Its insidious nature and response from services disaffirmed their experience and gradually led to greater disability in the course of illness. Patients with heart failure perceived breathlessness as a contributing factor to the negative effects of other symptoms. In MND breathlessness meant that the illness was a dangerous threat to patients' lives.

Analyses were conducted by intention to treat.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nKey components of the social worker-led intervention included a structured evaluation of prognostic understanding, end-of-life preferences, symptom burden, and quality of life with routine review by a palliative care physician; communication of this information to treating clinicians; and longitudinal follow-up in the ambulatory setting.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nPercentage of patients with physician-level documentation of advanced care preferences and the degree of alignment between patient and cardiologist expectations of prognosis at 6 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe study population (N = 50) had a mean (SD) age of 72 (11) years and had a mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.33 (13). Of 50 patients, 41 (82%) had been hospitalized more than once for HF management within 12 months of enrollment. At enrollment, treating physicians anticipated death within a year for 32 patients (64%), but 42 patients (84%) predicted their life expectancy to be longer than 5 years. At 6 months, more patients in the intervention group than in the control group had physician-level documentation of advanced care preferences in the electronic health record (17 [65%] vs 8 [33%]; χ2 = 5.1; P = .02). Surviving patients allocated to intervention were also more likely to revise their baseline prognostic assessment in a direction consistent with the physician's assessment (15 [94%] vs 4 [26%]; χ2 = 14.7; P < .001). Among the 31 survivors at 6 months, there was no measured difference between groups in depression, anxiety, or quality-of-life scores.\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nPatients at high risk for mortality from HF frequently overestimate their life expectancy. Without an adverse impact on quality of life, prognostic understanding and patient-physician communication regarding goals of care may be enhanced by a focused, social worker-led palliative care intervention that begins in the hospital and continues in the outpatient setting.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02805712.\n"

            "abstract": "Background. Single-disease-focused treatment and hospital-centric care are poorly suited to meet complex needs in an era of multimorbidity. Understanding variation in palliative care's association with treatment choices is essential to optimizing interdisciplinary decision making in care of complex patients. Aim. To estimate the association between palliative care and hospital costs by primary diagnosis and multimorbidity for adults with one of six life-limiting conditions: heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver failure, kidney failure, neurodegenerative conditions including dementia, and HIV/AIDS. Methods. Data from four studies (2002-2015) were pooled to provide an analytic dataset of 73,304 participants with mean costs $10,483, of whom 5,348 (7%) received palliative care. We estimated average effect of palliative care on direct hospital costs among the treated, using propensity scores to control for observed confounding. Results. Palliative care was associated with a statistically significant reduction in total direct costs for heart failure (estimated treatment effect: -$2666; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -$3440 to -$1892), neurodegenerative conditions (-$3523; -$4394 to -$2651), COPD (-$1613; -$2217 to -$1009), kidney failure (-$3589; -$5132 to -$2045), and liver failure (-$7574; -$9232 to -$5916). The association for liver failure patients was statistically significantly larger than for any other disease group. Cost-saving associations were also statistically larger for patients with multimorbidity than single disease for two of the six groups: neurodegenerative and liver failure. Conclusions. Heterogeneity in treatment effect estimates was observable in assessing association between palliative care and hospital costs for adults with serious life-limiting illnesses other than cancer. The results illustrate the importance of careful definition of palliative care populations in research and practice, and raise further questions about the role of interdisciplinary decision making in treatment of complex medical illness."

Pregnancy in these patients carries a high risk of maternal and fetal mortality. With advancing gestational age, these women may develop cardiac failure due to increased cardiorespiratory requirements. When medical therapy proves insufficient, cardiac surgery becomes mandatory to save the patient's life. Balloon valvuloplasty is only palliative treatment, the duration of benefit being only 6 months. Valve replacement is thus recommended. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery with valve replacement has been reported to carry a lower risk of maternal mortality (1.5-13%) but a very high fetal risk (16-40%). This paper reports the case of a 30-year-old primigravida with severe AS with bicuspid aortic valve and pulmonary congestion clinically uncontrolled, in whom CPB surgery and aortic valve replacement was performed as an emergency procedure, along with a lower segment Caesarian section.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The outcome of unrelieved severe symptomatic AS in pregnancy is poor.

A specifically trained nurse had multiple contacts with the patient, family, physician, and hospital staff to elicit preferences, improve understanding of outcomes, encourage attention to pain control, and facilitate advance care planning and patient-physician communication.\n## RESULTS\nThe phase I observation documented shortcomings in communication, frequency of aggressive treatment, and the characteristics of hospital death: only 47% of physicians knew when their patients preferred to avoid CPR: 46% of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were written within 2 days of death; 38% of patients who died spent at least 10 days in an intensive care unit (ICU); and for 50% of conscious patients who died in the hospital, family members reported moderate to severe pain at least half the time. During the phase II intervention, patients experienced no improvement in patient-physician communication (eg, 37% of control patients and 40% of intervention patients discussed CPR preferences) or in the five targeted outcomes, ie, incidence or timing of written DNR orders (adjusted ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.15), physicians' knowledge of their patients' preferences not to be resuscitated (adjusted ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.49), number of days spent in an ICU, receiving mechanical ventilation, or comatose before death (adjusted ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.07), or level of reported pain (adjusted ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.33). The intervention also did not reduce use of hospital resources (adjusted ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.12).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe phase I observation of SUPPORT confirmed substantial shortcomings in care for seriously ill hospitalized adults. The phase II intervention failed to improve care or patient outcomes. Enhancing opportunities for more patient-physician communication, although advocated as the major method for improving patient outcomes, may be inadequate to change established practices. To improve the experience of seriously ill and dying patients, greater individual and societal commitment and more proactive and forceful measured may be needed.\n"

            "abstract": "Palliative care is indicated in patients with heart failure since the early phases of the disease, as suggested by international guidelines. However, patients are referred to palliative care very late. Many barriers could explain the gap between the guidelines' indications and clinical practice. The term palliative is perceived as a stigma by doctors, patients, and family members because it is charged with negative meanings, a poor prognosis, and no hope for improvement. Many authors prefer the term supportive care, which could facilitate a discussion between doctors, patients, and caregivers. There is substantial variation and overlap in the meanings assigned to these two terms in the literature. Prognosis, as the main indication to palliative care, delays its implementation. It is necessary to modify this paradigm, moving from prognosis to patients' needs. The lack of access to palliative care programs is often due to a lack of palliative care specialists and this shortage will be greater in the near future. In this study, a new model is proposed to integrate early over the course of the disease the palliative care (PC) specialist in the heart failure team, allowing to overcome the barriers and to achieve truly simultaneous care in the treatment of heart failure (HF) patients."

The use of most pharmacological treatment options are based on experience in other disorders or from non-randomized historical controls, case series, or expert opinion. Levodopa may provide some improvement in symptoms of Parkinsonism (specifically bradykinesia and rigidity) in PSP and CBD; however, evidence is conflicting and where present, benefits are often negligible and short lived. In fact, \"poor\" response to levodopa forms part of the NINDS-SPSP criteria for the diagnosis of PSP and consensus criteria for the diagnosis of CBD (Lang Mov Disord. 20 Suppl 1:S83-91, 2005; Litvan et al. Neurology. 48:119-25, 1997; Armstrong et al. Neurology. 80(5):496-503, 2013). There is some evidence that intrasalivery gland botulinum toxin is useful in managing problematic sialorrhea and that intramuscular botulinum toxin and baclofen are helpful in reducing dystonia, including blepharospasm. Benzodiazepines may also be useful in managing dystonia. Myoclonus may be managed using levetiracetam and benzodiazepines. Pharmacological agents licensed for Alzheimer's disease (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists) have been used off-label in PSP, CBD, and other tauopathies with the aim of improving cognition; however, there is limited evidence that they are effective and risk of adverse effects may outweigh benefits. The use of atypical antipsychotics for behavioural symptoms is not recommended in the elderly or those with demetia associated conditions and most antipsychotics will worsen Parkinsonism. Antidepressants may be useful for behavioral symptoms and depression but are often poorly tolerated due to adverse effects. In the absence of an effective drug treatment to target the underlying cause of CBD and PSP, management should focus on optimizing quality of life, relieving symptoms and assisting patients with their activities of daily living (ADL). Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of neurologists, physiotherapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), speech and language therapists (SALT), dieticians, ophthalmologists, psychologists, and palliative care specialists."

The patient, a male, received bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMMC) at age 16 and again at age 17 with significant improvement of his biochemical liver function tests, ascites build-up, asthenia, splenomegaly and quality of life. Furthermore, liver biopsies showed clear reduction of the inflammation and fibrosis from Ishak score dropped from 3 to 1 paralleling the symptomatic improvement of the patient."

Adequate end of life care for people with non-malignant disease requires acknowledgement of their limited prognosis and appropriate care planning. Case conferences between specialist palliative care services and GPs improve outcomes in cancer-based populations. We report a pilot study of case conferences between the patient's GP and specialist staff to facilitate care planning for people with end stage heart failure or non-malignant lung disease in a regional health service in Queensland Australia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Single face to face case conferences about patients with a primary diagnosis of advanced heart failure or respiratory failure from non-malignant disease were conducted between a palliative care consultant, a case management nurse and the patient's GP. Annualised rates of service utilisation (emergency department [ED] presentations, ED discharges back to home, hospital admissions, and admission length of stay) before and after case conference were calculated. Content and counts of case conference recommendations, and the rate of adherence to recommendations were also assessed. A process evaluation of case conferences was undertaken.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-three case conferences involving 21 GPs were conducted between November 2011 and November 2012.

Those patients have high incidence of chronic conditions along with high mortality rates and for some of them a decline in functional status within the first 12 months of dialysis therapy. Nevertheless, the elderly dialysis patients represent a very heterogeneous group where prognostic tools may help the decision-making process together with family members, medical staff and the patients. Despite the fact that there are many validated prognostic tools in elderly population, no score has the aim to guide the decision to withhold or withdrawn the dialysis procedure; therefore, in many cases, a time-limited trial is supported. After the failure of improvement in life quality and certitude of the poor prognosis, the withdrawing from renal replacement therapy can be done. Medical literature, from developed countries, brings robust evidence that the process of withdrawing the dialysis procedure, after a fail in the so-called \"time-limited trial\", along with good quality palliative care in this scenario is related to a good quality of death. We, on the other hand, believe that the withdrawing process in countries where hospice and good palliative care is not a reality may be associated with bad outcomes. Therefore, this review discusses a way to improve end-of-life symptoms in countries where palliative care facilities are not a reality, the so-called \"palliative dialysis\"."

It impacts patients and their families in various ways, including physical, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects. As stroke is potentially lethal and causes severe symptom burden, a palliative care (PC) approach is indicated in accordance with the definition of PC published by the WHO in 2002. Stroke patients can benefit from a structured approach to palliative care needs (PCN) and the amelioration of symptom burden. Stroke outcome is uncertain and outlook may change rapidly. Regarding these challenges, core competencies of PC include the critical appraisal of various treatment options, and openly and respectfully discussing therapeutic goals with patients, families, and caregivers. Nevertheless, PC in stroke has to date mainly been restricted to short care periods for dying patients after life-limiting complications. There is currently no integrated concept for PC in stroke care addressing the appropriate moment to initiate PC for stroke patients, and the question of how to screen for symptoms remains unanswered. Therefore, PC for stroke patients is often perceived as a stopgap in cases of unfavorable prognosis and very short survival times. In contrast, PC can provide much more for stroke patients and support a holistic approach, improve quality of life and ensure treatment according to the patient's wishes and values. In this short review we identify key aspects of PC in stroke care and current barriers to implementation. Additionally, we provide insights into our approach to PC in stroke care."

This study used the Hospice Use Model to examine community, care recipient, and caregiver characteristics associated with hospice use before death among 145 community-dwelling care recipients with Alzheimer disease and their caregivers. Secondary analysis using logistic regression modeling indicated that older age, male gender, black race, and better functional health of care recipients with Alzheimer disease were associated with a decreased likelihood of using hospice (model χ25 = 23.5, P = .0003). Moreover, care recipients recruited from an Alzheimer clinic were more likely to use hospice than those recruited from adult day-care centers. Caregiver factors were not independent predictors of hospice use. However, there was a significant interaction between hours of care provided each week and recruitment site. Among care recipients from the Alzheimer clinic, the probability of hospice use increased as caregiving intensity increased. This relationship was reversed in care recipients from day-care centers. Results suggest that adult day-care centers need to partner with hospice programs in the community.

The Breathlessness Intervention Service (BIS) is a multi-disciplinary complex intervention, theoretically underpinned by a palliative care approach, utilising evidence-based non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to support patients with advanced disease in managing their breathlessness. Having published the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of BIS for patients with advanced cancer and their carers, we sought to establish its effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, in advanced non-malignant conditions.\n## METHODS\nThis was a single-centre Phase III fast-track single-blind mixed method RCT of BIS versus standard care for breathless patients with non-malignant conditions and their carers. Randomisation was to one of two groups (randomly permuted blocks). Eighty-seven patients referred to BIS were randomised (intervention arm n = 44; control arm n = 43 received BIS after four-week wait); 79 (91 %) completed to key outcome measurement. The primary outcome measure was 0-10 numeric rating scale for patient distress due to breathlessness at four weeks. Secondary outcome measures were Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Client Service Receipt Inventory, EQ-5D and topic-guided interviews.\n## RESULTS\nQualitative analyses showed the positive impact of BIS on patients with non-malignant conditions and their carers; quantitative analyses showed a non-significant greater reduction in the primary outcome ('distress due to breathlessness'), when compared to standard care, of -0.24 (95 % CI: -1.30, 0.82). BIS resulted in extra mean costs of £799, reducing to £100 when outliers were excluded; neither difference was statistically significant. The quantitative findings contrasted with those previously reported for patients with cancer and their carers, which showed BIS to be both clinically and cost effective. For patients with non-malignant conditions there was a notable trend of improvement over both trial arms to the key measurement point; participants may have experienced a therapeutic effect from the research interviews, diluting the intervention's impact.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBIS had a statistically non-significant effect for patients with non-malignant conditions, and slightly increased service costs, but had a qualitatively positive impact consistent with findings for advanced cancer. Trials of palliative care interventions should consider multiple, mixed method, primary outcomes and ensure that protocols limit potential contaminating therapeutic effects in study designs.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN04119516 (December 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00678405 (May 2008).\n"

            "abstract": "This paper examines the provision of integrated advanced dementia care within seven European countries and critically reviews the potential contribution of the Prudent Healthcare perspective as a starting point for reform. Progressive efforts to innovate, promote quality and integrate care are tempered with the reality of resource constraints. Some policy makers in Europe and North America have turned their attention to the principles of Prudent Healthcare as a potential mechanism to maximise benefits for patients within available resources. As dementia progresses, living well requires increasing levels of support and care, people living with advanced dementia have complex health and social care needs, are highly dependent on others but are not yet at the terminal end stage of the condition. People with advanced dementia can benefit from a dementia specific palliative approach to care (Palliare), that helps them to live the best life possible for the months and often years they live with advanced dementia. It is also highly desirable to align policy innovations with integrated palliative care practice models and the education of the dementia workforce to accelerate informed improvements in advanced dementia care. There may be some coherence, at least superficially between Prudent Healthcare and integrated palliative care models such as Palliare. It is argued that for successful implementation, both require practitioners to be equipped with knowledge and skills and be empowered to deliver high quality care often within impoverished care environments. Adoption of the prudent perspective will however require development of a repertoire of approaches to hear the voice or proxy voice of people living with advanced dementia and to commit to the development and implementation of new evidence for advanced dementia practice. Evidence informing this policy debate draws upon contemporary literature and policy and the findings from research activities undertaken by the Palliare project supported through the Erasmus+ K2 Strategic Partnerships funding programme."

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nTo examine the effects of home-based transitional palliative care for patients with end-stage heart failure (ESHF) after hospital discharge.\n## METHODS\nThis was a randomised controlled trial conducted in three hospitals in Hong Kong. The recruited subjects were patients with ESHF who had been discharged home from hospitals and referred for palliative service, and who met the specified inclusion criteria. The interventions consisted of weekly home visits/telephone calls in the first 4 weeks then monthly follow-up, provided by a nurse case manager supported by a multidisciplinary team. The primary outcome measures were any readmission and count of readmissions within 4 and 12 weeks after index discharge, compared using χ(2) tests and Poisson regression, respectively. Secondarily, change in symptoms over time between control and intervention groups were evaluated using generalised estimating equation analyses of data collected using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS).\n## RESULTS\nThe intervention group (n=43) had a significantly lower readmission rate than the control group (n=41) at 12 weeks (intervention 33.6% vs control 61.0% χ(2)=6.8, p=0.009). The mean number (SE) of readmissions for the intervention and control groups was, respectively, 0.42 (0.10) and 1.10 (0.16) and the difference was significant (p=0.001). The relative risk (CI) for 12-week readmissions for the intervention group was 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88). There was no significant difference in readmissions between groups at 4 weeks. However, when compared with the control group, the intervention group experienced significantly higher clinical improvement in depression (45.9% vs 16.1%, p<0.05), dyspnoea (62.2% vs 29.0%, p<0.05) and total ESAS score (73.0% vs 41.4%, p<0.05) at 4 weeks. There were significant differences between groups in changes over time in quality of life (QOL) measured by McGill QOL (p<0.05) and chronic HF (p<0.01) questionnaires.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis study provides evidence of the effectiveness of a postdischarge transitional care palliative programme in reducing readmissions and improving symptom control among patients with ESHF.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER\nHKCTR-1562; Results.\n"

We used data collected between September 1, 2013, and August 31, 2015, from a community hospital in Maryland (United States) for patients with a primary diagnosis of heart failure.

Risk factors include hepatitis B and C, hepatic cirrhosis, including alcohol related hepatitis, metabolic and nutritional hepatic damage. The main modality of diffusion is intrahepatic in the natural course of the disease. There are two leading types of treatment: local and systemic. Surgical resection and liver transplantation constitute the most appropriate local treatments and are considered the only real possibility for recovery. Other local approaches include: radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol ablation, hepatic endoarterial chemoembolization and intrahepatic radiotherapy (SIRT: selective internal radiation therapy). These last treatments are used to control the disease when surgery or transplantation is not achievable; in some cases they are able to prolong survival while they constitute mainly a palliative treatment. Systemic treatments include: chemotherapy, immunological and hormonal therapies and, more recently, the introduction of new specific molecular target drugs. At the moment, in this group, the only drug that has given positive results during phase III trials (SHARP study) is Sorafenib. Sorafenib represents the only primary systemic therapy that has demonstrated, unlike the other treatments previously described, an increase in survival rate in patients affected with advanced HCC. Currently, other studies are taking place that are further developing the potential of this drug. These studies, including phase III trials, are directed in order to test the activity and safety of new emerging drugs with targeted activity. Examples of these new agents are: Sunitinib, Gefitinib, Cetuximab, Bevacizumab and Erlotinib."

Excisional biopsy of the resected mass was associated with an infiltrative cellular parathyroid neoplasm with solid and nested architectural growth pattern admixed with hemorrhage and focal calcifications. The tumor showed lymphovascular and perineural invasion. At the time of workup and despite the absence of a positive SPEP/UPEP, a bone marrow biopsy was requested to rule out multiple myeloma.

Patient- and family-related barriers to having end-of-life discussions included: difficulty accepting prognosis, limitations and complications, and lack of capacity. For providers, the most important barriers were: lack of training, uncertainty about prognosis, and lack of time.

Our results indicate that PST led to greater reduction in depressive symptoms of late-life major depression than supportive therapy (ST) and reminiscence therapy. PST resulted in reductions in depression comparable with those of paroxetine and placebo in patients with minor depression and dysthymia, although paroxetine led to greater reductions than placebo. In home health care, PST was more effective than usual care in reducing symptoms of depression in undiagnosed patients. PST reduced disability more than ST in patients with major depression and executive dysfunction. Preliminary data suggest that a home-delivered adaptation of PST that includes environmental adaptations and caregiver involvement is efficacious in reducing disability in depressed patients with advanced cognitive impairment or early dementia. In patients with macular degeneration, PST led to improvement in vision-related disability comparable to that of ST, but PST led to greater improvement in measures of vision-related quality of life. Among stroke patients, PST participants were less likely to develop a major or minor depressive episode than those receiving placebo treatment, although the results were not sustained in a more conservative statistical analysis. Among patients with macular degeneration, PST participants had significantly lower 2-month incidence rates of major depression than usual care participants and were less likely to suffer persistent depression at 6 months. Finally, among stroke patients, PST participants were less likely to develop apathy than those receiving placebo treatment. PST also has been delivered via phone, Internet, and videophone, and there is evidence of feasibility and acceptability. Further, preliminary data indicate that PST delivered through the Internet resulted in a reduction in depression comparable with that of in-person PST in home-care patients. PST delivered via videophone results in an improvement in hospice caregivers' quality of life and a reduction in anxiety comparable to those of in-person PST. PST-treated patients with cognitive impairment may require additional compensatory strategies, such as written notes, memory devices, environmental adaptations, and caregiver involvement."

            "abstract": "A 64-year-old woman with recurrent mitral valve stenosis was hospitalized 30 years after open commissurotomy. Severe right cerebral embolism occurred at age 58, with left hemiparesis. She was debilitated with cardiac cachexia. Based on symptomatic valvular disease findings, surgery was considered, but deemed too high risk due to the combined insufficiencies. She refused this surgical operation and requested conservative therapy. Optimized medication and cardiac rehabilitation improved her general condition allowing transfer to another hospital. We explained the short life expectancy both to her and to her family. They decided to transfer to a hospice at a chronic care hospital and she was given best supportive care. Eventually, her urine output decreased and respiration deteriorated. She and her family refused resuscitation in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest, requesting only suffering reduction. Thus, continuous intravenous infusion of morphine was started. The optimized doses for pain alleviation were determined in consultation with palliative care specialists and maximized her consciousness level for the last four days. \"Heart-failure hospice\" is potentially a place to die for end-of-life patients, attended by their families and healthcare providers. They need prognostic information and options for end-stage. Our experience confirms results about palliative care from previous studies conducted overseas demonstrating the effectiveness of opioids relieving end-stage symptoms. <Learning objective: Perform an appropriate end-of-life assessment for patients with irreversible severe heart failure. Formulate appropriate plans for further evaluation and management, including referral and consultation to palliative care specialists when necessary. Develop an appropriate regional cooperation, with consideration given to the less common optional treatment for cardiac dysfunction, \"heart-failure hospice.\">."

Now with amyloid-positron emission tomography (amyloid-PET) neuroimaging, this AD hallmark can be detected antemortem. Practitioners and patients need to better understand potential diagnostic benefits and limitations of amyloid-PET and the complex practical, ethical, and social implications surrounding this new technology. To complement the practical considerations, Eli Lilly and Company sponsored a Bioethics Advisory Board to discuss ethical issues that might arise from clinical use of amyloid-PET neuroimaging with patients being evaluated for causes of cognitive decline. To best address the multifaceted issues associated with amyloid-PET neuroimaging, we recommend this technology be used only by experienced imaging and treating physicians in appropriately selected patients and only in the context of a comprehensive clinical evaluation with adequate explanations before and after the scan."

However, these interventions are historically underutilized, particularly by African Americans.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe performed a prospective randomized intervention trial in patients with advanced HF who were hospitalized for acute decompensation at 3 urban hospitals, comparing the effect of palliative care consultation (PCC) with that of usual care. The primary end point was the proportion choosing comfort-oriented care (hospice and/or \"do not resuscitate\" [DNR] order) 3-6 months after randomization. A total of 85 patients (mean age 68 years, 91.8% African American) were enrolled over a 2-year period. Four of the 43 patients (9.3%) randomized to the PCC group chose comfort-oriented care versus 0 of the 42 control group members (risk difference = 9.3%; 95% confidence interval = -11.8% to 30.0%).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this predominantly African-American cohort of hospitalized patients with advanced HF, PCC did not lead to a greater likelihood of comfort care election compared with usual care.

            "abstract": "Acute Heart Failure (AHF) is a \" multi-event disease\" and hospitalisation is a critical event in the clinical course of HF. Despite relatively rapid relief of symptoms, hospitalisation for AHF is followed by an increased risk of death and re-hospitalisation. In AHF, risk stratification from clinically available data is increasingly important in evaluating long-term prognosis. From the perspective of patients, information on the risk of mortality and re-hospitalisation would be helpful in providing patients with insight into their disease. From the perspective of care providers, it may facilitate management decisions, such as who needs to be admitted and to what level of care (i.e. floor, step-down, ICU). Furthermore, risk-stratification may help identify patients who need to be evaluated for advanced HF therapies (i.e. left-ventricle assistance device or transplant or palliative care), and patients who need early a post-discharge follow-up plan. Finally, risk stratification will allow for more robust efforts to identify among risk markers the true targets for therapies that may direct treatment strategies to selected high-risk patients. Further clinical research will be needed to evaluate if appropriate risk stratification of patients could improve clinical outcome and resources allocation."

A comprehensive search of all major healthcare-related databases and websites was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were quality assessed, employing widely used quality-assessment tools, with only papers scoring moderate-to-high quality included. All relevant data were extracted. A narrative synthesis was used to analyse, process and present the final data. The findings indicated that the frequency and quality of palliative care conversations is generally poor. Patients and physicians identified many barriers and important topics were not discussed. Patients and clinicians reported tension between remaining hopeful and the reality of the patients' condition. When discussions did happen, they often occurred at an advanced stage of illness and in respiratory wards and intensive care units.

Of these, 134 patients readmitted within 30 days were identified as cases; 1,418 other patients, with no readmissions were identified as controls. Patients readmitted for hospice or elective surgery were excluded. An additional 248 patients deceased on index admission were included for only a comparison of mortality rates. Factors explored included socio-demographic characteristics, clinical comorbidities, stroke characteristics, and length of stay. Chi-square test of proportions and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify independent predictors of 30-day stroke readmissions. Mortality rates were compared for index admission and readmission and among readmission diagnoses.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among the 1,544 patients in the main analysis, 67% of index stroke admissions were ischemic, 22% hemorrhagic, and 11% TIA. The 30-day readmission rate was 8.7%. The most common etiologies for readmission were infection (30%), recurrent stroke and TIA (20%), and cardiac complications (14%). Significantly higher proportion of those readmitted for recurrent strokes and TIAs presented within the first week (p = 0.039) and had a shorter index admission length of stay (p = 0.027). Risk factors for 30-day readmission included age >75 (p = 0.02), living in a facility prior to index stroke (p = 0.01), history of prior stroke (p = 0.03), diabetes (p = 0.03), chronic heart failure (p ≤ 0.001), atrial fibrillation (p = 0.03), index admission to non-neurology service (p < 0.01), and discharge to other than home (p < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, index admission to a non-neurology service was an independent predictor of 30-day readmission (p ≤ 0.01). The mortality after a within 30-day readmission after stroke was higher than index admission (36.6 vs. 13.8% p ≤ 0.001) (OR 3.6 95% CI 2.5-5.3). Among those readmitted, mortality was significantly higher for those admitted for a recurrent stroke (p = 0.006).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Approximately one-third of 30-day readmissions were infection related and one-fifth returned with recurrent stroke or TIA. Index admission to non-neurology service was an independent risk factor of 30-day readmissions. The mortality rate for 30-day readmission after stroke is more than 2.5 times greater than index admissions and highest among those readmitted for recurrent stroke. Identifying high-risk patients for readmission, ensuring appropriate level of service, and early outpatient follow-up may help reduce 30-day readmission and the high associated risk of mortality."

Improving hospital-to-home transition for this population is a logical step in responding to current practice guidelines' recommendations for coordination and education. Positive outcomes have been reported from trials evaluating multiple interventions, enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up through the addition of a case management role. The question remains if similar gains could be achieved working with usual hospital and community nurses.\n## METHODS\nA 12-week, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted of the effect of transitional care on health-related quality of life (disease-specific and generic measures), rates of readmission, and emergency room use. The nurse-led intervention focused on the transition from hospital-to-home and supportive care for self-management 2 weeks after hospital discharge.\n## RESULTS\nAt 6 weeks after hospital discharge, the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better among the Transitional Care patients (27.2 +/- 19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care patients (37.5 +/- 20.3 SD; P = 0.002).

            "abstract": "Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are one of the most common causes of emergency hospital admission and place great burden upon healthcare systems. Furthermore, AECOPD represent an important life event for patients, and are associated with significant reductions in physical activity, skeletal muscle function, exercise tolerance and health-related quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation, an intervention comprising supervised exercise-training and education, may counteract these negative consequences and target modifiable risk factors for hospital readmission. A recent Cochrane systematic review included 20 randomized controlled trials comparing pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbation of COPD versus conventional care. Overall, the evidence supports moderate to large effects on health-related quality of life and exercise capacity. However, there is substantial heterogeneity across studies, and more recent studies have been more equivocal, including around hospital readmissions, particularly when rehabilitation is started in the inpatient setting. In this narrative review, we examine the rationale for pulmonary rehabilitation following AECOPD with a particular focus on skeletal muscle function, review the current evidence for pulmonary rehabilitation in the AECOPD setting, and identify areas that require future research, including the structure and nature of the intervention, improving uptake and adherence, and the role of alternative rehabilitation strategies for patients with AECOPD."

            "abstract": "## IMPORTANCE\nFew health systems have adopted effective dementia care management programs. The Care Ecosystem is a model for delivering care from centralized hubs across broad geographic areas to caregivers and persons with dementia (PWDs) independently of their health system affiliations.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether the Care Ecosystem is effective in improving outcomes important to PWDs, their caregivers, and payers beyond those achieved with usual care.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nA single-blind, randomized clinical trial with a pragmatic design was conducted among PWDs and their caregivers. Each PWD-caregiver dyad was enrolled for 12 months between March 20, 2015, and February 28, 2017. Data were collected until March 5, 2018. Study interventions and assessments were administered over the telephone and internet by clinical and research teams in San Francisco, California, and Omaha, Nebraska. Of 2585 referred or volunteer PWD-caregiver dyads in California, Iowa, or Nebraska, 780 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled. A total of 512 PWD-caregiver dyads were randomized to receive care through the Care Ecosystem and 268 dyads to receive usual care. All eligible PWDs had a dementia diagnosis; were enrolled or eligible for enrollment in Medicare or Medicaid; and spoke English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Analyses were intention-to-treat.\n## INTERVENTION\nTelephone-based collaborative dementia care was delivered by a trained care team navigator, who provided education, support and care coordination with a team of dementia specialists (advanced practice nurse, social worker, and pharmacist).\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nPrimary outcome measure: Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease based on caregiver's rating of 13 aspects of PWD's well-being (including physical health, energy level, mood, living situation, memory, relationships, and finances) on a 4-point scale (poor to excellent). Secondary outcomes: frequencies of PWDs' use of emergency department, hospitalization, and ambulance services; caregiver depression (score on 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire; higher scores indicate more severe depression); and caregiver burden (score on 12-Item Zarit Burden Interview; higher scores indicate more severe caregiver burden).\n## RESULTS\nThe 780 PWDs (56.3% female; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [9.9] years) and 780 caregivers (70.9% female; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [12.0] years) lived in California (n = 452), Nebraska (n = 284), or Iowa (n = 44). Of 780 dyads, 655 were still active at 12 months, and 571 completed the 12-month survey. Compared with usual care, the Care Ecosystem improved PWD quality of life (B, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.30; P = .04), reduced emergency department visits (B, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.01; P = .04), and decreased caregiver depression (B, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.15 to -0.13; P = .03) and caregiver burden (B, -1.90; 95% CI, -3.89 to -0.08; P = .046).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nEffective care management for dementia can be delivered from centralized hubs to supplement usual care and mitigate the growing societal and economic burdens of dementia.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02213458.\n"

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) has been identified by the Gold Standards Framework as a clinical indicator of advancing disease. We hypothesised the ADO index (for 'Age, Dyspnoea and airflow Obstruction'), which predicts mortality, could be applied to our LTOT population to help identify patients with poor prognosis. We aimed to compare this to the Medical Research Council dyspnoea scale, body mass index, forced expiratory volume in 1 s and gas transfer.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a retrospective study on 136 patients with COPD started on LTOT, June 2003 to August 2010. Data were collected from LTOT databases and medical records. Patients' length of survival was calculated from initiation of LTOT. Patients were grouped by individual parameters. Survival rates at 6 months, 1 year and 4 years were calculated.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The end of life may be a time of high service utilisation for older adults. Transitions between care settings occur frequently, but may produce little improvement in symptom control or quality of life for patients. Ensuring that patients experience co-ordinated care, and moves occur because of individual needs rather than system imperatives, is crucial to patients’ well-being and to containing health-care costs.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to understand the experiences, influences and consequences of transitions between settings for older adults at the end of life. Three conditions were the focus of study, chosen to represent differing disease trajectories.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      England.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      Thirty patients aged over 75 years, in their last year of life, diagnosed with heart failure, lung cancer and stroke; 118 caregivers of decedents aged 66–98 years, who had died with heart failure, lung cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or selected other cancers; and 43 providers and commissioners of services in primary care, hospital, hospice, social care and ambulance services.\n    \n\n\n          Design and methods:\n        \n      \n      This was a mixed-methods study, composed of four parts: (1) in-depth interviews with older adults; (2) qualitative interviews and structured questionnaire with bereaved carers of older adult decedents; (3) telephone interviews with care commissioners and providers using case scenarios derived from the interviews with carers; and (4) analysis of linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and mortality data relating to hospital admissions for heart failure and lung cancer in England 2001–10.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Transitions between care settings in the last year of life were a common component of end-of-life care across all the data sets that made up this study, and many moves were made shortly before death. Patients’ and carers’ experiences of transitions were of a disjointed system in which organisational processes were prioritised over individual needs. In many cases, the family carer was the co-ordinator and provider of care at home, excluded from participation in institutional care but lacking the information and support to extend their role with confidence. The general practitioner (GP) was a valued, central figure in end-of-life care across settings, though other disciplines were critical of GPs’ expertise and adherence to guidelines. Out-of-hours services and care homes were identified by many as contributors to unnecessary transitions. Good relationships and communication between professionals in different settings and sectors was recognised by families as one of the most important influences on transitions but this was rarely acknowledged by staff.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Development of a shared understanding of professional and carer roles in end-of-life transitions may be one of the most effective ways of improving patients’ experiences. Patients and carers manage many aspects of end-of-life care for themselves. Identifying ways to extend their skills and strengthen their voices, particularly in hospital settings, would be welcomed and may reduce unnecessary end-of-life transitions. Why the experiences of carers appear to have changed little, despite the implementation of a range of relevant policies, is an important question that has not been answered. Recommendations for future research include the relationship between policy interventions and the experiences of end-of-life carers; identification of ways to harmonise understanding of the carers’ role and strengthen their voice, particularly in hospital settings; identification of ways to reduce the influence of interprofessional tensions in end-of-life care; and development of interventions to enhance patients’ experiences across transitions.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme."

In preparation for the introduction of ACP in Norway, we wanted to explore the views of Norwegian pulmonary patients on ACP. We conducted four focus group interviews in a Norwegian teaching hospital, with a sample of 13 patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer or lung fibrosis. Analysis was by systematic text condensation. Participants' primary need facing end-of-life communication was \"the comforting safety\", implying support, information and transparency, with four underlying themes: 1) provide good team players; 2) offer conversations with basic information; 3) seize the turning point; and 4) balance transparency. Good team players were skilled communicators knowledgeable about treatment and the last phase of life. Patients preferred dialogues at the time of diagnosis and at different \"turning points\" in the disease trajectory and being asked carefully about their needs for communication and planning. Transparency was important, but difficult to balance. ACP for patients with life-threatening pulmonary disease should rest upon an established patient-doctor/nurse relationship and awareness of turning points in the patient's disease progression. Individually requested and tailored information can support and empower patients and their relatives."

Upon autopsy, the bladder was found to contain polyps of invasive squamous cell carcinoma, similar in morphology to the tumor mass in the heart. Her lungs contained multiple tumor emboli at different stages, which was likely the final cause of her death. Squamous cell carcinoma metastases to the endocardium are extremely rare and without defined treatment. Surgery can improve prognosis in those with primary tumors that are benign or without metastases. In those with symptomatic metastatic tumors, palliative debulking can done although generally will not improve prognosis. It is currently unknown whether radiation improves survival.

New palliative therapies are being reconsidered for the effective management of disease because of setbacks in the development of disease-modifying therapies.

SUVN-502 is a novel 5-HT6 receptor antagonist (Ki=2.04 nmol/l) with high receptor affinity and high degree of selectivity. SUVN-502 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) demonstrated procognitive effects in various behavioral animal models (object recognition task, water maze, and radial arm maze), and it acts on three phases of cognition, viz., acquisition, consolidation, and retention (object recognition task). SUVN-502 (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) modulated glutamate levels when administered alone (microdialysis). At doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o., SUVN-502 potentiated the effects of donepezil (microdialysis). SUVN-502 [1 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.)] also potentiated pharmacological effects of memantine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) and/or donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) (θ modulation). The beneficial effects of SUVN-502 on learning and memory might be mediated through the modulation of cholinergic and/or glutamatergic neurotransmission in relevant brain regions. In summary, behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological outcomes indicate that SUVN-502 may augment the beneficial effects of donepezil and memantine combination."

However, the pathogenesis of AD includes several factors such as cholinergic hypothesis, amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation, and oxidative stress. For this reason, the design of compounds that target the genesis and progression of AD could offer a therapeutic benefit. We have designed a set of compounds (M-1 to M-5) with pharmacophore moieties to inhibit the release, aggregation, or toxicity of Aβ, act as AChEIs and have antioxidant properties. Once the compounds were designed, we analyzed their physicochemical parameters and performed docking studies to determine their affinity values for AChE, β-site amyloid-protein precursor cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and the Aβ monomer. The best ligands, M-1 and M-4, were then synthesized, chemically characterized, and evaluated in vitro. The in vitro studies showed that these compounds inhibit AChE (M-1 Ki = 0.12 and M-4 Ki = 0.17 μM) and BACE1 (M-1 IC50 = 15.1 and M-4 IC50 = 15.4 nM). They also inhibit Aβ oligomerization and exhibit antioxidant activity. In addition, these compounds showed low cytotoxicity in microglial cells. For these reasons, they are promising for future use as drugs in AD mice transgenic models."

            "abstract": "In the last few years, important changes have occurred in the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients that were admitted to cardiac intensive care units (CICU). Care has shifted from acute coronary syndrome patients towards elderly patients, with a high prevalence of non-ischemic cardiovascular diseases and a high burden of non-cardiovascular comorbid conditions: both increase the susceptibility of patients to developing life-threatening critical conditions. These conditions are associated with a significant symptom burden and mortality rate and an increased length of stay. In this context, palliative care programs, including withholding/withdrawing life support treatments or the deactivation of implanted cardiac devices, are frequently needed, according to the specific guidelines of scientific societies. However, the implementation of these recommendations in clinical practice is still inconsistent. In this review, we analyze the reasons for this gap and the main cultural changes that are required to improve the care of patients with advanced illness."

            "abstract": "Illness staging is widely utilized in several medical disciplines to help predict course or prognosis, and optimize treatment. Staging models in psychiatry in general, and bipolar disorder in particular, depend on the premise that psychopathology moves along a predictable path: an at-risk or latency stage, a prodrome progressing to a first clinical threshold episode, and one or more recurrences with the potential to revert or progress to late or end-stage manifestations. The utility and validity of a staging model for bipolar disorder depend on its linking to clinical outcome, treatment response and neurobiological measures. These include progressive biochemical, neuroimaging and cognitive changes, and potentially stage-specific differences in response to pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Mechanistically, staging models imply the presence of an active disease process that, if not remediated, can lead to neuroprogression, a more malignant disease course and functional deterioration. Biological elements thought to be operative in bipolar disorder include a genetic diathesis, physical and psychic trauma, epigenetic changes, altered neurogenesis and apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Many available agents, such as lithium, have effects on these targets. Staging models also suggest the utility of stage-specific treatment approaches that may not only target symptom reduction, but also impede illness neuroprogression. These treatment approaches range from prevention for at-risk individuals, to early intervention strategies for prodromal and newly diagnosed individuals, complex combination therapy for rapidly recurrent illness, and palliative-type approaches for those at chronic, late stages of illness. There is hope that prompt initiation of potentially disease modifying therapies may preclude or attenuate the cognitive and structural changes seen in the later stages of bipolar disorder. The aims of this paper are to: a) explore the current level of evidence supporting the descriptive staging of the syndromal pattern of bipolar disorder; b) describe preliminary attempts at validation; c) make recommendations for the direction of further studies; and d) provide a distillation of the potential clinical implications of staging in bipolar disorder within a broader transdiagnostic framework."

            "abstract": "Most people die when they are old, but predicting exactly when this will occur is unavoidably uncertain. The health of older people is challenged by multimorbidity, disability and frailty. Frailty is the tendency to crises or episodes of rapid deterioration. These are often functional or non-specific in nature, such as falls or delirium, and recovery is usually expected. Health-related problems can be defined in terms of distress and disability. Distress is as often mental as physical, especially for people with delirium and dementia. Problems can be addressed using the principles of supportive and palliative care, but there is rarely a simple solution. Most problems do not have a palliative drug treatment, and the propensity to adverse effects means that drugs must be used with caution. Geriatricians use a model called comprehensive geriatric assessment, including medical, functional, mental health, social and environmental dimensions, but also use a variety of other models, such as the acute medical model, person-centred care, rehabilitation, alongside palliative care. Features such as communication, family engagement and advance planning are common to them all. These approaches are often consistent with each other, but their commonalities are not always recognised. The emphasis should be on making the right decision at a given point in time, taking account of what treatment is likely to deliver benefit, treatment burden and what is wanted. Choices are often limited by what is available and feasible. Palliative care should be integrated with all medical care for frail older people."

Though individuals living with dementia have complex care needs and would benefit from a palliative approach to care, they have traditionally not been recipients of such care. An important aspect of determining quality in end-of-life care is the identification of expert practices, processes or behaviors that may help achieve this care. However, for those living with dementia in nursing homes, we have a limited understanding of how to best support expert end of life care. To redress this gap in knowledge, the purpose of this study was to examine and describe expert care of the individual with dementia approaching death from the perspective of nurses and health care aides (HCAs) identified by their peers as having special expertise in caring for this population.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A qualitative research design known as Interpretative Description was used to conduct the study.

The six critical behaviors in caring for residents dying with dementia included: 1) recognizing and responding to changes in a resident's pattern of behavior; 2) attending to the person; 3) working with the family; 4) engaging with others; 5) responding after the death has occurred; and 6) having a positive attitude toward care of the dying.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The critical behaviors described by nurses and HCAs in this study provides emerging evidence of best practices in care of those with dementia and their families, particularly near the end of life within the nursing home setting."

            "abstract": "Among the various risky complications of liver cirrhosis, refractory ascites is associated with poor survival of cirrhotics and persistently worsens their quality of life (QOL). Major clinical guidelines worldwide define refractory ascites as ascites that cannot be managed by medical therapy either because of a lack of response to maximum doses of diuretics or because patients develop complications related to diuretic therapy that preclude the use of an effective dose of diuretics. Due to the difficulty in receiving a liver transplantation (LT), the ultimate solution for refractory ascites, most cirrhotic patients have selected the palliative therapy such as repeated serial paracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, or peritoneovenous shunt to improve their QOL. During the past several decades, new interventions and methodologies, such as indwelling peritoneal catheter, peritoneal-urinary drainage, and cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy, have been introduced. In addition, new medical treatments with vasoconstrictors or vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists have been proposed. Both the benefits and risks of these old and new modalities have been extensively studied in relation to the pathophysiological changes in ascites formation. Although the best solution for refractory ascites is to eliminate hepatic failure either by LT or by causal treatment, the selection of the best palliative therapy for individual patients is of utmost importance, aiming at achieving the longest possible, comfortable life. This review briefly summarizes the changing landscape of variable treatment modalities for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites, aiming at clarifying their possibilities and limitations. Evolving issues with regard to the impact of gut-derived systemic and local infection on the clinical course of cirrhotic patients have paved the way for the development of a new gut microbiome-based therapeutics. Thus, it should be further investigated whether the early therapeutic approach to gut dysbiosis provides a better solution for the management of cirrhotic ascites."

            "abstract": "Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common comorbidity in patients with lung and head- and neck cancer. Patients with lung cancer who also suffer from COPD have a worse prognosis than patients with lung cancer and no COPD. It has previously been shown that diagnosis and treatment of concomitant COPD in patients with newly diagnosed lung- or head and neck cancer need optimization. In this randomized, controlled trial we aimed to assess if intervention directed at improving treatment for COPD in these patients improved health-related quality of life (QoL). Methods: During 2014, we randomized 114 patients referred for oncological treatment at a large university hospital in the Capital Region of Denmark, to either usual care or intervention regarding concomitant COPD. The intervention consisted of two visits in an out-patient clinic established at the oncological department and staffed with a pulmonary physician. At baseline, week 13 and week 25, all patients filled out the cancer- and COPD-specific QoL questionnaires CAT and EORTC, respectively. The primary outcome was change in CAT-score between control- and intervention group. The secondary outcome was change in EORTC. Results: There was no change in CAT-score by week 13 or 25 between the groups. For the EORTC there was a statistically significant improvement only in the fatigue domain at week 13 (p = 0.03), but not at week 25. There was a trend towards less dyspnea in the intervention group at week 13, measured by EORTC (p = 0.07). Mortality by week 25 was similar in both groups. Conclusion: In this population of severely ill cancer patients, we did not find that this intervention, focusing on inhaled COPD medication, for the management of COPD had any convincing positive impact on the patients' perceived quality of life compared with usual care. Further studies are needed."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate MT4C-In Care for feasibility, acceptability, ease of use, and satisfaction, along with its potential to help decrease carer's feelings of grief and improve their hope, general self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The study was a mixed-methods single-arm repeated measures feasibility study. Participants accessed MT4C-In Care over a 2-month period. Data were collected at baseline and 1 and 2 months. Using a checklist, participants evaluated MT4C-In Care for ease of use, feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction. Measures were also used to assess the effectiveness of the MT4C-In Care in improving hope (Herth Hope Index), general self-efficacy (GSES), loss and grief (NDRGEI), and health-related quality of life (SF12v2) of participants. Qualitative data were collected at 2 months and informed quantitative findings.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The majority of the 37 participants were female (65%; 24/37), married (73%; 27/37), and had a mean age of 63.24 years (SD = 11.68). Participants reported that MT4C-In Care was easy to use, feasible, and acceptable. Repeated measures ANOVA identified a statistically significant increase over time in participants hope scores (p = 0.03) and a significant decrease in grief (< 0.001). Although significant differences in mental health were not detected, hope (r = 0.43, p = 0.03) and grief (r = - 0.66, p < 0.001) were significantly related to mental health quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      MT4C-In Care is feasible, acceptable, and easy to use and shows promise to help carers of family members with ADRD residing in LTC increase their hope and decrease their grief. This study provides the foundation for a future pragmatic trial to determine the efficacy of MT4C-In Care.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03571165.

            "abstract": "Palliative treatment for people with heart disease or dementia may be hindered by lack of awareness of the proximity of death. Of those who died in hospital, 55 per cent of caregivers felt that symptom control was good but 14 per cent thought pain had not been controlled and 45 per cent reported uncontrolled dyspnoea. A further problem was that, despite being known to the hospital, dying patients were admitted to hospital through the emergency department. Here they had to wait in an unsuitable environment although the need was for comfort and spiritual support. The authors suggest that all patients should be cared for according to the principles of palliative care when organ failure is progressive, and that the formation of a palliative care team for terminal non-cancer patients would improve care."

There is yet to be consensus on the most appropriate way to categorise raw accelerometer data into behaviourally relevant metrics such as intensity, especially in chronic disease populations. Therefore the aim of this study was to estimate acceleration values corresponding to inactivity and MVPA during daily living activities of patients with heart failure (HF), via calibration with oxygen consumption (VO2) and to compare these values to previously published, commonly applied PA intensity thresholds which are based on healthy adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-two adults with HF (mean age 71 ± 14 years) undertook a range of daily living activities (including laying down, sitting, standing and walking) whilst measuring PA via wrist- and hip-worn accelerometers and VO2 via indirect calorimetry. Raw accelerometer output was used to compute PA in units of milligravity (mg). Energy expenditure across each of the activities was converted into measured METs (VO2/resting metabolic rate) and standard METs (VO2/3.5 ml/kg/min). PA energy costs were also compared with predicted METs in the compendium of physical activities. Location specific activity intensity thresholds were established via multilevel mixed effects linear regression and receiver operator characteristic curve analysis. A leave-one-out method was used to cross-validate the thresholds.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Accelerometer values corresponding with intensity thresholds for inactivity (< 1.5METs) and MVPA (≥3.0METs) were > 50% lower than previously published intensity thresholds for both wrists and waist accelerometers (inactivity: 16.7 to 18.6 mg versus 45.8 mg; MVPA: 43.1 to 49.0 mg versus 93.2 to 100 mg).

The core elements of the approach are participation, action and reflection. Approximately 40 staff (almost exclusively women) in 18 community pharmacies actively participates in the project, i.e. needs assessment, interactive workshops, practice projects and evaluation.

Moreover, a high frequency of contact with people living with dementia and their caregivers was reported by the majority of staff. Professional competencies related to dementia care are a key issue, and community pharmacy personnel viewed their practice with a critical eye: Communicating with disoriented persons poses some challenges, as does communicating with caregivers.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In the still ongoing project the raised issues are being dealt with in practice projects that are performed by the pharmacies with the support of the project staff.

            "abstract": "Potential benefits from earlier referral to palliative care have been described, at least for people with metastatic cancer, and include better symptom management and longer survival. However, the specification of supportive and palliative care services varies widely, and the elements of care provided to intervention and control groups in studies are not described. The definition of early or late referral also varies. Some people are referred whilst still receiving disease-modifying treatment, others when a decision has been taken to discontinue such treatment. The time period for people to be referred may be between the last 6 months to a year of life, to only a few weeks.\n    \n\n      \n      For diseases or conditions with trajectories that are hard to predict, for example heart failure and COPD, or conditions where recovery from treatment is unlikely but still possible, it is difficult to define the criteria for early or late referral and to compare the effect of one timing against the other. Some conditions, such as some neurological diseases including dementia, may deprive a person of the ability to express their wishes regarding palliative care and, for them, it may be prudent to initiate discussions earlier after diagnosis."

            "abstract": "In the United Kingdom, approximately a third of people with dementia live in long-term care facilities for adults, the majority of whom are in the last years of life. Working arrangements between health services and care homes in England are largely ad hoc and often inequitable, yet quality end-of-life care for people with dementia in these settings requires a partnership approach to care that builds on existing practice. This paper reports on the qualitative component of a mixed method study aimed at evaluating an organisational intervention shaped by Appreciative Inquiry to promote integrated working between visiting health care practitioners (i.e. General Practitioners and District Nurses) and care home staff. The evaluation uses a social identity approach to elucidate the mechanisms of action that underlie the intervention, and understand how organisational change can be achieved. We uncovered evidence of both (i) identity mobilisation and (ii) context change, defined in theory as mechanisms to overcome divisions in healthcare. Specifically, the intervention supported integrated working across health and social care settings by (i) the development of a common group identity built on shared views and goals, but also recognition of knowledge and expertise specific to each service group which served common goals in the delivery of end-of-life care, and (ii) development of context specific practice innovations and the introduction of existing end-of-life care tools and frameworks, which could consequently be implemented as part of a meaningful bottom-up rather than top-down process. Interventions structured around a Social Identity Approach can be used to gauge the congruence of values and goals between service groups without which efforts to achieve greater integration between different health services may prove ineffectual. The strength of the approach is its ability to accommodate the diversity of service groups involved in a given area of care, by valuing their respective contributions and building on existing ways of working within which practice changes can be meaningfully integrated."

Timely referrals are beneficial to both patient and caregivers as a way to offer improved care and support at end of life; when multiple, complicated, co-morbid states affect care. This is especially true when a patient's psychosocial background would otherwise make it difficult to ensure proper comfort and quality of life. In this report, we present an 86 year old man with a history of right-sided breast cancer, bipolar disorder and dementia. Patient is 20 years status-post a total mastectomy. He declined adjuvant radiation, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and did not pursue any further medical follow-up. Patient now presented with a rapidly enlarging, ulcerating right anterior chest wall tumor. Surgical biopsy revealed recurrent infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast. Patient was started on tamoxifen and palliative radiation. An oncology evaluation determined that he is not a candidate for curative treatment. Patient's primary caregiver (wife) concurrently suffers from dementia, one son is Bipolar, and the second son is out of state. A full geriatric assessment concluded that based on the patient's medical and socioeconomic history, he is an ideal candidate for hospice. With the family's consent, he was enrolled in one of our local hospice organizations. Currently, he is in a skilled nursing facility with hospice."

We also report relevant in-press results from the Trans MetLife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals (TMLS) on end-of-life and later-life trans-aging. To obtain relevant literature, we employed the search engines Google Scholar, Stanford Highwire, and PubMed/Medline. Databases searched included Web of Science, Cinhal, PsyINFO, Gender Studies Database, Sociological Abstracts, and Social Services Abstracts. Keyword searches included \"transgender\" and \"transsexual.\" Key phrases included \"transgender aging,\" \"transsexual aging,\" and \"LGBT aging.\" Years searched were from January 1, 2011, through April 26, 2013. We found two types of articles: LGBT aging-related (or lumped aging) articles and articles that focused specifically on transgender aging, or trans-aging. We found that the articles spoke of concerns and fears regarding discrimination, potential abuse at the hands of caregivers, inability to live out their lives in their true identities, risk of becoming homeless, loss of independence, and dementia, among other concerns. We note that the elder trans-identified population is significantly ill-prepared for the major legal issues that arise and events that occur in the later-life to end-of-life time periods. Despite these difficulties, a few articles spoke of resilience and successful aging in the population. Some TMLS respondents indicated that they were considering either \"detransitioning,\" that is, changing social presentation to the pretransition gender identity, or suicide (which some referred to as euthanasia) as means of managing the severe problems they expected to encounter later in the aging process. A number of potentially modifiable risk factors exist within this population. Modification strategies include increasing the population awareness of the need for end-of-life legal preparations for members of the trans-identified community as well as those who serve it. There is a continued need to reduce stigma and to include gender identity/gender presentation in nondiscrimination and hate crime statutes. Despite these difficulties, there is a resilience and robustness that can be found in many individuals within the community of transgender older adults. There is a need to investigate this further."

            "title": "Screening and Initiating Supportive Care in Patients With Heart Failure.",
            "abstract": "Background: Patients with heart failure (HF) experience a major symptom burden and an overall reduction of quality of life. However, supportive care (SC) remains an under-utilized resource for these patients. Among the many existing barriers to integrating SC into routine care, identifying patients with SC needs remains challenging. The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is an important predictor of SC needs in patients with HF. Methods and Results: We used the shortened version KCCQ-12 as a screening tool for SC need in our ambulatory HF patient population using a KCCQ-12 summary score of <29 as the cut-off. Of the 456 patients who completed the KCCQ-12, 41 (9%) were predicted to have SC needs. Demographics, medical history, biochemical parameters, echocardiographic assessment and medical treatment were similar between the two groups of patients. However, patients with KCCQ-12 <29 were more symptomatic based on both New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and American Heart Association (AHA) staging with a higher prevalence of depression. We established a multidisciplinary SC clinic and the profile and outcomes of patients with SC needs that were referred and followed at our SC clinic were also evaluated. Twenty-three patients were referred to our SC clinic: 2 died before being seen, 1 refused SC and 20 received SC. Of these 20 patients, 11 died and 9 are currently being followed. Median survival after starting the SC clinic is 3 months. In the original SC cohort of 23, 17 patients had available KCCQ-12 summary scores. However, only 6 out of 17 (35%) had KCCQ-12 scores <29, indicating the need for additional assessment tools in this patient population. Conclusions: The magnitude of unmet supportive care needs in patients with HF is significant. While the KCCQ-12 questionnaire is a useful tool to identify patients with SC, serial clinical evaluation, establishment of a SC clinic and prompt referral are essential for patients needing supportive care."

            "title": "Musculoskeletal pain reported by mobile patients with chronic kidney disease.",
            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Musculoskeletal pain has been reported as a clinical problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The purpose of this study was to compare the frequency of musculoskeletal pain in patients with CKD and no mobility problems with a general population and to investigate the impact of pain on quality of life (QOL), physical activity and physical function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with CKD Stages 4 and 5 with or without a dialysis treatment and no mobility problems were included. Musculoskeletal pain in the shoulder/neck, back/low back and limbs and level of physical activity were measured using the Danish Health and Morbidity Survey and coded into dichotomous answers. QOL and physical function were measured using the kidney disease QOL questionnaire and the 30-s chair stand test, respectively. Data for the general population were collected in national registers and adjusted for age, gender and region.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The patients (n = 539) had a mean age of 66 [95% confidence interval (CI) 65-67] years, 62% were men and they were treated with haemodialysis (HD) (n = 281), peritoneal dialysis (n = 62) or without dialysis (n = 196). The frequency of reported musculoskeletal pain in the patients did not exceed pain reported by the general population [e.g. pain in the limbs in patients undergoing HD versus a matched general population, 61% versus 63% (P = 0.533), respectively]. Pain in all measured body sites was associated with reduced QOL [e.g. pain in the limbs associated with a physical component scale β of -8.2 (95% CI -10.3 to -6.0), P < 0.001]. Pain in the limbs was associated with a reduced number of repetitions in the 30-s chair stand test [mean -1.7 (95% CI -3.0 to -0.4), P = 0.009]. Pain in the shoulder/neck was associated with reduced odds of being physically active [odds ratio 0.6 (95% CI 0.4 to 0.9); P = 0.022].\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Musculoskeletal pain was not more frequently reported by patients with CKD and no mobility problems compared with the general population. However, as musculoskeletal pain was reported by up to two-thirds of the patient sample, healthcare professionals should remember to focus on this issue. The patients' pain was associated with negative impacts on QOL, level of physical activity and physical function."

            "abstract": "This article presents an overview of end-of-life care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their family caregivers. We define end-stage AD, and review neuropsychological and behavioral characteristics along with concomitant issues in therapeutic assessment. We then review the literature regarding programs and treatments for end-stage AD, the need for advance care planning and family participation in medical decision-making, familial caregiving stress, and issues associated with palliative care and bereavement outcomes. Methodological issues in the extant research literature are addressed, including issues of treatment implementation, validity, and clinical significance. Translational research and demonstration projects are encouraged."
