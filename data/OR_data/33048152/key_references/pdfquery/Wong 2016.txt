ABSTRACT 
Objective To examine the effects of home-based 
transitional palliative care for patients with end-stage 
heart failure (ESHF) after hospital discharge. 
Methods This was a randomised controlled trial 
conducted in three hospitals in Hong Kong. The 
recruited subjects were patients with ESHF who had 
been discharged home from hospitals and referred for 
palliative service, and who met the speciﬁed inclusion 
criteria. The interventions consisted of weekly home 
visits/telephone calls in the ﬁrst 4 weeks then monthly 
follow-up, provided by a nurse case manager supported 
by a multidisciplinary team. The primary outcome 
measures were any readmission and count of 
readmissions within 4 and 12 weeks after index 
discharge, compared using χ2 tests and Poisson 
regression, respectively. Secondarily, change in symptoms 
over time between control and intervention groups were 
evaluated using generalised estimating equation analyses 
of data collected using the Edmonton Symptom 
Assessment Scale (ESAS). 
Results The intervention group (n=43) had a 
signiﬁcantly lower readmission rate than the control 
group (n=41) at 12 weeks (intervention 33.6% vs 
control 61.0% χ2=6.8, p=0.009). The mean number 
(SE) of readmissions for the intervention and control 
groups was, respectively, 0.42 (0.10) and 1.10 (0.16) 
and the difference was signiﬁcant ( p=0.001). The 
relative risk (CI) for 12-week readmissions for the 
intervention group was 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88). There was 
no signiﬁcant difference in readmissions between groups 
at 4 weeks. However, when compared with the control 
group, the intervention group experienced signiﬁcantly 
higher clinical improvement in depression (45.9% vs 
16.1%, p<0.05), dyspnoea (62.2% vs 29.0%, p<0.05) 
and total ESAS score (73.0% vs 41.4%, p<0.05) at 
4 weeks. There were signiﬁcant differences between 
groups in changes over time in quality of life (QOL) 
measured by McGill QOL ( p<0.05) and chronic HF 
( p<0.01) questionnaires. 
Conclusions This study provides evidence of the 
effectiveness of a postdischarge transitional care 
palliative programme in reducing readmissions and 
improving symptom control among patients with ESHF.

INTRODUCTION 
Heart failure (HF) is a worldwide health issue1 2 
resulting in high mortality rates of 40% and 75%, 
respectively, within the ﬁrst year3 and at 5 years4 
after diagnosis. The treatment of chronic HF has 
improved in the last decade, with updated national 
guidelines for diagnosis and disease management. 
Palliative care (PC) can be initiated when end-stage 
HF (ESHF) is diagnosed,1 2 with the ratio of PC to 
life-prolonging care gradually increasing when 
patients are refractory to treatment.1 5 
Patients with advanced HF experience marked 
reductions in health-related quality of life (QOL). 
The three most prevalent physical 
symptoms 
reported by these patients are fatigue, dyspnoea 
and swelling of arms and legs.3 Psychologically, 
patients with HF experience feelings of uncertainty 
and fear since their conditions can change rapidly 
and the feeling of death is imminent.6 Socially, 
isolated and lonely,6 and 
patients with HF feel 
regard themselves as a burden to their carers since 
they often require assistance in daily living.7 These 
in refractory 
patients, with complicated issues 
and difﬁcult 
symptoms, psychological distress 
decision-making involving families, would beneﬁt 
from a specialist PC team trained in these skills.8 
However, PC is reported to be underused among 
patients with HF.9 10 
The reasons for low use of PC among patients 
with ESHF are multifactorial, disease-related, 
person-related and system-related.4 The unpredict- 
able disease trajectories in HF make the prognosti- 
life span difﬁcult.11 Care providers, 
cation of 
including cardiologists and primary care physicians, 
lack appreciation of the palliative concept and fail 
to recognise specialist PC as a tangible service.12 
Patients are often unaware of PC as a treatment 
choice.2 At the system level, there is a lack of care 
coordination in the specialties of HF and PC,4 
which may be attributed to suboptimal trust and 
rapport between providers.12 There need to be 
clearer guidelines of how and when specialist PC 
should 
advanced HF 
management.12 




PC has a long history among patients with 
cancer. In the last decade, studies have emerged 
using non-cancer and cancer patients as a study 
population when testing the effects of PC models. 
studies was conducted by 
One of 
Brumley et al, who tested an in-home PC multidis- 
ciplinary intervention programme among patients 
with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD) and chronic heart failure (CHF), ﬁnding 
signiﬁcant reductions in emergency room visits, 
hospital days and costs compared with a usual care 



group.11 A systematic review that examined studies involving 
both cancer and non-cancer patients also showed that multidis- 
ciplinary PC support can signiﬁcantly reduce readmissions, with 
particularly strong evidence among the HF group.13 
The models for current provision of PC for patients with HF 
vary, with some hospital-based and others community-based.14 
A current review showed that home-based PC interventions 
among community HF subjects could reduce hospital admis- 
sions and enhance symptom management.15 Another study, 
testing the effects of clinic-based consultations, found that the 
ability of patients with HF in symptom management was better 
with more frequent clinic consultations.16 There is a lack of 
studies exploring the effects of transitional care support for 
patients with ESHF. Transitional care involves deliberately 
designed programmes to provide proactive and continuous 
support to patients returning home after hospital discharge with 
the intensity and duration of activity events planned with evi- 
dence support. Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of 
transitional care programmes among medical patients in redu- 
cing hospital readmissions.17 18 There is no previous transitional 
programme designed for patients with ESHF and thus no empir- 
ical results reporting its effects. The objective of this study was 
to examine the effects of home-based transitional PC for 
patients with ESHF after hospital discharge. 
METHODS 
Study design 
This was a multiple-site randomised controlled trial involving 
two arms. The intervention group received home visits/tele- 
phone calls every week for the ﬁrst month and less frequently 
during the subsequent months for a total of 12 months. This 
study will report results of readmissions up to 12 weeks and 
other outcomes up to 4 weeks, the initial endpoint after delivery 
of the intensive intervention. Both groups received usual care, 
which consisted of PC medical clinic consultation, discharge 
advice on symptom management and medication and referrals if 
appropriate (eg, home visits). 
Setting and subjects 
The study took place in three hospitals within the Hospital 
Authority (HA), Hong Kong between May 2013 and December 
2014. The HA is government funded and employs corporate 
governance which aligns practice within the system. These three 
hospitals were selected because there were established referral 
systems between the medical/cardiac and PC teams. Subjects 
who fulﬁlled the following criteria were recruited: (a) met two 
of the following indicators identiﬁed as ESHF by the Prognostic 
Indicator Guidance:19 (i) CHF New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) stage III or IV, (ii) patient thought to be in the last year 
of life by clinicians, (iii) repeated hospital admissions (three 
within 1 year) with symptoms of HF and (iv) existence of phys- 
ical/psychological symptoms despite optimal tolerated therapy; 
(b) Cantonese-speaking; (c) living within the service area; (d) 
contactable by phone and (e) referral accepted by PC team. The 
exclusion criteria were: (a) discharged to institutions, (b) inabil- 
ity to communicate, (c) diagnosed with severe psychiatric disor- 
ders and (d) recruited to other programmes. An advanced 
practice nurse (APN) helped to screen cases for eligibility (see 
online supplementary material) and conﬁrmed the recruitment 
with the physician. The patients were approached, and consent- 
ing subjects signed a consent form. The responsible APN then 
called the site investigator for a random assignment generated 
by the computer software Research Randomizer. The investiga- 
tor, who had no knowledge of the subject’s identity, provided 


the 
(‘1’=control; ‘2’=study). 

We assumed the effect of our study to be similar to that of a 
previous study that used home-based palliative follow-up for 
patients with end-stage organ failure.20 In that 
the 
average number of 30-day readmissions was reduced from 2.23 
to 1.25. By Lehr’s equation,21 a sample size of 29 per group 
(=4/(2.230.5−1.250.5)2) is adequate to achieve 80% power with 
a signiﬁcance level of 0.05. Taking into account a 20% dropout 
rate, 35 subjects were needed per group. 



Intervention 
The 
Palliative-ESHF 
design 
(TCP-ESHF) programme was based on two main conceptual 
guides: the recommended principles of PC for patients with HF 
and the 4Cs for transitional care model. For the principles of 
PC, 
the team referenced composite guidelines drawn from 
Scotland, Europe and Canada,5 22 which could be summarised 
into the following six principles: (i) case management with peri- 
odic review; (ii) discussion of end-of-life issues; (iii) multidiscip- 
for communication, 
linary approach; 
cardiovascular and PC; (v) discussion of treatment preferences 
and (vi) integrated model of care. The transitional care frame- 
work was the 4Cs model tested and used by Wong et al with 
general medical patients.17 18 The 4Cs are comprehensiveness, 
continuity, coordination and collaboration in alignment with the 
PC principles mentioned above in providing continuous and 
coordinated care with multidisciplinary support. Previous 
studies17 18 have shown that a 4-week intervention with weekly 
structured events provided a strong enough dose to bring about 
effects. 

The TCP-ESHF was delivered by nurse case managers 
(NCMs) who were qualiﬁed PC home nurses with experience of 
caring for patients with HF. The NCMs were supported by the 
PC physician in service delivery. Before a patient’s discharge, 
the nurse met the patient/patient’s family to conduct a predis- 
charge assessment. After discharge, the patient was followed up 
in the ﬁrst 4 weeks as below: 
Week 1—the NCM and trained volunteers (TVs) conducted a 
home visit together. 
Week 2—the NCM provided a telephone follow-up. 
Week 3—the TVs conducted a home visit in pairs. 
Week 4—the NCM provided a telephone follow-up. 
After the ﬁrst 4 weeks, the subjects in the intervention group 
received monthly home visits and telephone follow-up until the 
end of 12 weeks. Based on the Omaha framework,17 the NCM 
assessed patients’ needs in the environmental, psychosocial, 
physiological and health-related behaviour domains and inter- 
vened accordingly. The Omaha system was ﬁrst developed in the 
USA and has been tested and used locally.17 18 At each of the 
encounters, the NCM would set goals and develop a mutually 
agreed care plan with the patients. The home visits, telephone 
calls and referrals were governed by protocols to ensure a con- 
sistent approach to care delivery. The NCM was assisted by TVs 
who were nursing students 
trained in providing patient 
support.17 18 The NCMs and TVs received 18 and 9 h of train- 
ing, respectively (see online supplementary material). 
Placebo calls for the control group 
The control group received two attention control 
social 
calls17 18 from an assistant, consisting of light conversation 
topics unrelated to clinical issues. 


Data collection and measures 
Data were collected at discharge (O1), at the primary endpoint 
at 4 weeks postdischarge (O2) and at the secondary endpoint at 
12 weeks for readmission data. The clinical and readmission 
data were extracted from the hospital information system. The 
demographic and secondary data were collected by research 
assistants who were trained and blind to the grouping. The 
inter-rater reliability reached 0.90. 
Baseline demographic and clinical data 
The demographic data included age, gender, marital status, educa- 
tion, employment, accommodation and economic status. The clin- 
surgical 
ical data included aetiology, 
intervention received, comorbidity, medications and length of stay. 

Primary data 
The primary data were readmissions within 4 and 12 weeks 
after the index hospital discharge. 
Secondary data 
Symptom intensity was measured by the Edmonton Symptom 
Assessment Scale (ESAS), which assesses eight symptoms: pain, 
tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sense 
of well-being and dyspnoea using a 0–100 mm visual analogue 
scale with established validity and Cronbach’s α reliability of 0.8.23 
Functional status was measured by the Palliative Performance 
Scale (PPS), speciﬁcally designed for palliative patients11 to

reﬂect ﬁve physical aspects of palliative patients: ambulation, 
activities, self-care, intake and consciousness level. It has a rating 
scale from 100 (normal) to 0 (death) measured in 10% decre- 
ments with an internal consistency Cronbach’s α of 0.83.11 




QOL was measured by a palliative-speciﬁc scale, the McGill 
quality of life questionnaire-Hong Kong (MQOL-HK) version 
and 
failure 
questionnaire-Chinese (CHQ) version. The MQOL-HK mea- 
sures four domains ( physical, psychological, existential and 
support) on a numerical scale from 0 to 10, validated for local 
use with a Cronbach’s α of 0.83.24 The CHQ is a Canadian 
HF-speciﬁc QOL tool measuring 20 items on a 7-point Likert 
scale representing four domains: dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional 
status and mastery. It was translated into Chinese and validated 
with a Cronbach’s α of 0.95.25 



Data analysis 
Statistical analysis 
Descriptive statistics were presented to describe the demo- 
graphic and clinical variables. Poisson regression was used to 
examine the mean difference in 28-day and 84-day readmission 
between groups, and the relative risks for the intervention 
group were examined. The between-group rates were compared 
using the χ2 test. The generalised estimating equation (GEE) was 
used to examine the group, time and interaction effects on the

secondary outcome variables. GEE was used because it treats 
observations of longitudinal data as correlated, using robust SE 
estimates to get valid inference.26 The proportion of patients 
with improvement/deterioration/no change in symptoms (ESAS) 
was calculated based on the minimal clinically important differ- 
ence (MCID) cut-off reported in studies by Hui et al,27 28 and 
differences across groups were examined using χ2 tests. Both 
readmissions and MCID were computed based on actual data. 
The principle of intention to treat was employed and all statis- 
tical analyses were conducted using SPSS V.22.0 for Windows. 
RESULTS 
A total of 389 subjects were screened, with 305 excluded. The 
remaining 84 eligible subjects were randomised. A total of 16 
subjects were lost to follow-up (see ﬁgure 1). Table 1 displays 
the demographic and clinical baseline data. The mean age of the 
subjects was 78.3, with males (52.4%) slightly outnumbering 
females. The demographic background of the two groups was 
equivalent. There was no signiﬁcant between-group difference 
in clinical parameters, including HF aetiology, mean left ven-

medications received, except for the NYHA Class ( p=0.03). 
The perceived health status (PPS and ESAS) at baseline were 
equivalent in the two groups, and there was no signiﬁcant dif- 
ference in their length of hospital stay. 
The intervention group had a lower 4-week readmission rate 
(intervention 20.9% vs control 29.3% χ2=4.41, p=0.79) and 
mean number of readmissions (intervention 0.21 (SE 0.07) vs 
control 0.41 (SE 0.10) p=0.097), but the difference was not sig- 
niﬁcant. At 12 weeks, the readmission rate (intervention 33.6% 
vs control 61.0% χ2=6.8, p=0.009) and mean number of read- 
missions (intervention 0.42 (SE 0.10) vs control 1.10 (SE 0.16), 
p=0.001) became signiﬁcantly lower for the intervention group 
(see table 2). The relative risks (CI) for 4-week and 12-week 
readmissions for the intervention group were, respectively, 0.81 
(0.51 to 1.27) and 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88). 

the symptom intensity was examined. 
Compared with the control group, 
the intervention group 
experienced signiﬁcantly higher clinical improvement in depres- 
sion (45.9% vs 16.1%, p<0.05), dyspnoea (62.2% vs 29.0%, 
p<0.05) and total score (73.0% vs 41.4%, p<0.05) (table 3). 
Table 4 displays the results of the secondary outcome compar- 
ing the baseline and week 4. There was no difference in func- 
tional status (PPS) within or between groups over time. There 
was some improvement in the symptom intensity of depression 
and anxiety as measured by ESAS over time in the intervention 
group, but there was no difference in improvement between 
groups. Both measures of QOL, the Chronic heart-failure ques-

( p<0.05), showed a signiﬁcant difference in the change over 
time between groups. When individual items were examined, all 
achieved statistically signiﬁcant difference with group-time 
effect, except for ‘fatigue’ in CHQC and ‘physical’ and ‘existen- 
tial’ in McGill. The intervention group had signiﬁcantly higher 
satisfaction with care than the control group ( p<0.001). 


DISCUSSION 
This study adds to the evidence that an intensive 4-week transi- 
tional home-based programme sustained by monthly follow-up 
is effective in reducing readmissions, controlling symptoms and 
enhancing QOL among patients with ESHF on returning home 
after hospital discharge. 

The design of the TCP-ESHF programme in this study con- 
tained evidence-based elements identiﬁed by a current systematic 
review that were found to be effective in reducing hospital read- 
missions. They were the use of multicomponents in interven- 
tions involving a multidisciplinary team in care delivery and 
supporting clients to optimise capacity for self-care.29 Few tran- 
sitional care studies have been conducted among patients with 
ESHF. Brumley et al tested a palliative programme among non- 
cancer patients, including HF and COPD subjects, ﬁnding that 
an in-home PC group had higher satisfaction and fewer hospita- 
lisations than a usual care group.11 This study obtained the 
same results and was also consistent with other trials in demon- 
strating that a home-based PC programme could enhance 
QOL.1 12 As in other studies,1 9 dyspnoea and fatigue were two 
common symptoms reported by subjects in this study. The 
NCMs in this study were able to empower their patients in 
symptom management, make adjustments to medications and 
if appropriate.11 18 Previous studies that 
offer early referral 
examined the effects of palliative home-based support focused 
on patients in the community who were referred for home 
care.11 20 This study shows that transitional care support after 
an episode of hospitalisation enabled patients to reduce hospital 
use and stay well in the community. Similar transitional care 
programmes, led by professionals and supported by volunteers, 
have proved cost-effective among general medical patients.30 
Patients with ESHF have typical PC needs that 
include 
symptom control and psychosocial support.31 The use of PC 
among patients with HF is low,9 as reﬂected by the low statistics 
that ranged from only 5% for non-cancer10 to 12% for HF32 
users of hospice services. One of the challenges in referring 
patients with HF to PC services is the unpredictable illness tra- 
jectory of HF, which makes accurate prognostication difﬁcult.33 
Advocacy of the PC approach in HF treatment guidelines helps 
remind clinicians to adopt this approach when appropriate and 
in the best interests of patients.32 The triggering of the palliative 
approach needs the collaboration of both PC and medical spe- 
cialists.9 This study beneﬁted from explicit referral guidelines 
developed in the study sites, supported by the medical/cardiac 
team and hospital management.

hospital to home.32 Having an innovative infrastructure design 
is important in helping to integrate the PC approach into the 
continuum of HF care.4 The design of the TCP-ESHF achieved 
the delivery of services that were comprehensive and coordi- 
nated in collaboration with a team comprising professionals and 
volunteers supporting patients with continuity. When the bio- 
medical curative approach of adding years to life is no longer 
possible, the holistic approach of PC to control symptoms and 
address patients’ needs is a preferred alternative.4 
This study has a number of limitations. The loss of follow-up 
was high, which is not uncommon among palliative patients. 
The rate was 24.4% and 14.0%, respectively, for the control 
and intervention groups, the main reasons being death and 
deterioration. The sample size was relatively small and there was 
a signiﬁcantly higher NYHA class in the control compared with 
the intervention group. The study was conducted in Hong 
Kong, whose healthcare system differs from those in other 
countries. Repeated studies should be conducted both within 
and outside Hong Kong with larger sample sizes to conﬁrm the 
internal and external validity of the ﬁndings. This study has 
focused on administrative outcomes, namely hospital readmis- 
sions. No existing studies have reported MCID for QOL, which 
is an important outcome measure for palliative patients. This 
study used symptom measures to calculate MCID, which fails to 
reﬂect the clinically important overall well-being of the patients. 
CONCLUSIONS 
This study has provided evidence of the effects of a post- 
discharge home-based palliative programme in reducing read- 
missions and enhancing QOL among patients with ESHF. The 
shifting of the focus from treatment to symptom control in the 
continuum of care requires the support of both cardiologists 
and PC physicians in building a referral mechanism and service 
model in the delivery of care. Home care nurses who are experi- 
enced in PC as well as HF symptom management are instrumen- 
tal in providing continuity of care for patients immediately after 
hospital discharge. The nurse’s access to both physician and 
multidisciplinary team is essential in providing early interven- 
tion when problems are detected.

What might this study add? 
▸ Specialist palliative care is beneﬁcial to non-cancer patients 

▸ Transitional care support, led by professionals supported by 
volunteers, can reduce hospital readmissions, enhance 
quality of life and achieve signiﬁcantly higher clinical 
improvement in symptom control among patients with 
end-stage heart failure. 
How might this impact on clinical practice? 
▸ Patients with heart failure at an advanced stage and 
refractory to medical therapy would beneﬁt from specialist 
palliative care. 

patients with end-stage heart failure requires organisational 
support to develop clear referral guidelines between medical 
and palliative care physicians, and mobilising resources to
