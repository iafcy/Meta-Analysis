BACKGROUND. The growing number of pa- 
tients with congestive heart failure has in- 
creased both the pressure on hospital resources 
and the need for community management of 
Improving hospital-to-home 
the condition. 
transition for this population is a logical step 
in responding to current practice guidelines’ 
recommendations for coordination and educa- 
tion. Positive outcomes have been reported 
from trials evaluating multiple interventions, 
enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up 
through the addition of a case management 
role. The question remains if similar gains 
could be achieved working with usual hospital 
and community nurses. 
METHODS. A 12-week, prospective, random- 
ized controlled trial was conducted of the ef- 
fect of transitional care on health-related qual- 
and generic 
(disease-specific 
ity of 
measures), rates of readmission, and emer- 
gency room use. The nurse-led intervention 
focused on the transition from hospital-to- 
self- 
home 







management 2 weeks after hospital discharge. 
RESULTS. At 6 weeks after hospital discharge, 
the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Fail- 
ure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better 
patients 
among 
(27.2 (cid:1) 19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care 
patients (37.5 (cid:1) 20.3 SD; P (cid:2) 0.002). Similar 
results were found at 12 weeks postdischarge 
for the overall MLHFQ and at 6- and 12- 
weeks postdischarge for the MLHFQ’s Phys- 
ical Dimension and Emotional Dimension 
subscales. Differences in generic quality life, 
as assessed by the SF-36 Physical component, 
Mental Component, and General Health sub- 
scales, were not significantly different be- 
tween the Transition and Usual Care groups. 
At 12 weeks postdischarge, 31% of the Usual 
Care patients had been readmitted compared 
with 23% of the Transitional Care patients 
(P (cid:2) 0.26), and 46% of the Usual Care group 
visited the emergency department compared 
with 29% in the Transitional Care group 
((cid:3)2 (cid:2) 4.86, df 1, P (cid:2) 0.03).

rect care activities (coordination, case managing and 
communication). Both hospital-based7,10,12 and 
community-based approaches11,13,14 have shown 
that an enhanced discharge process and follow-up, 
with the addition of a clinical nurse specialist, case 
manager, or cardiac nurse, produces positive patient 
benefit, reduces hospital readmission and health 
services utilization, or both. Characteristic themes are 
innovative delivery strategies, multiple interventions 
that add a component of comprehensive patient 
education and counseling, proactive nurse follow- 
up, and increased access to providers. However, 
these studies are limited by small sample size,11 
interventions requiring addition of new provid- 
ers,7,10 –12 and primary outcomes focusing exclusively 
on system-related endpoints eg, readmission and 
emergency visits.7,10 –12,14 In summary, the trials are 
evaluating health services designed to ‘case manage’ 
a population with CHF by maintaining provider 
contact with patients through intensive assessment 
and education techniques to prevent disease exacer- 
bation.15 However, Ferguson and Weinberger15 
found equivocal results in their review of case man- 
agement studies about the benefits in the health care 
system compared with the putative advantages. 
Thus, the question remains as to what can be done 
to stave off CHF exacerbations within the normal 
organization of services with the usual nurse provid- 
ers, who are typically generalists. Cook et al16 argue 
that complex systems can have gaps between peo- 
ple, stages, and processes. A key aspect for improve- 
ments is through the reinforcement of a practitio- 
ner’s normal ability to bridge these gaps. In the case 
of heart failure, our premise was that adding a new 
provider might not be the most effective, feasible, or 
efficient solution. Could the gap be bridged another 
way? Rather, by focusing on the activities of usual 
providers, and the structure and process of transition 
from hospital-to-home, could continuity with sup- 
port for self-management be enhanced to improve 
patient outcomes 
and reduce health service 
utilization? 
We conducted a prospective, randomized trial 
to evaluate whether the use of usual providers, 
and a reorganization of discharge planning and 
transition care with improved intersector linkages 
between nurses, could improve quality of life and 

im- 
provements in health-related quality of life 
(HRQL) associated with Transitional Care and 
Individuals with congestive heart failure (CHF) 
are one of the fastest growing and challenging 
complex health populations requiring care in both 
the hospital and community sectors. The incidence 
of CHF increases dramatically with age, and there 
is a 50% mortality after 5 years.1,2 CHF is reported 
to be the only cardiovascular condition that is 
increasing in incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and 
mortality.2–5 Heart failure may be an even greater 
public health problem than the statistics reveal. 
Estimates rely on ICD codes for primary and 
secondary diagnosis, and these have been re- 
ported to exclude one third of patients with clinical 
evidence of acute CHF.6 
For individuals and families dealing with heart 
failure, the condition poses significant challenges 
in terms of day-to-day living and the burden of 
care. Frequent hospital admissions are common.7,8 
There is a fragile balance between coping with this 
long-term condition at home and the exacerba- 
tions, often life-threatening, which require hospi- 
talization. Considering the illness trajectory of 
individuals with heart failure and the therapeutic 
limits of drug therapies, the effectiveness of non- 
pharmaceutical, adjunctive interventions has be- 
come a clinical and research priority. These inter- 
ventions include enhancing self-management and 
symptom control through knowledge, diet, rest 
and exercise, and proactive symptom monitoring. 
The former Agency for Health Care Policy and 
Research (AHCPR) guidelines4 for CHF, for exam- 
ple, make eight specific recommendations related 
to hospital discharge and counseling, and self- 
management. Professional bodies agree that effec- 
tive management of this condition requires collab- 
orative, proactive vigilance of medical therapies by 
health care providers and active support for self- 
management before and after hospitalizations.4,9 
Recommendations about incorporating a compre- 
hensive approach across sectors of care (hospital, 
ambulatory, and home care) have followed closely 
on the international efforts with clinical practice 
guidelines about heart failure.9 Recent randomized 
trials7,10 –12 have begun to rigorously evaluate the 
effectiveness of delivery models emphasizing sup- 
portive care for self-management (telephone out- 
reach, patient education and information), and indi- 



of home nurse visits were scheduled to match 
those received by Transitional Care group. The 
similar number of home visiting and provider 
contacts during the intervention period (2 weeks 
after hospital discharge) controlled for the effect of 
attention alone. 
On admission to hospital, the research coordi- 
nator flagged the patient’s chart as a signal to the 
patient’s primary nurse to follow a checklist of 
activities for Transitional Care. The protocol was 
implemented from admission to 2 weeks after 
hospital discharge, after which the patient received 
usual care by community nurses while on home 
care. During the pilot study for this trial, the 10 to 
14 days after hospital discharge was identified as 
the critical ‘settling in’ period after hospitalization. 
It was also a typical length of stay for home care 
follow-up after hospitalization. Eleven individuals 
were readmitted to hospital within 2 weeks of 
discharge (the intervention period). Timing for 
outcome measures then began on the second 
discharge and followed for 3 months. 
Usual Care and the Transitional Care 
Intervention 
Usual care for hospital-to-home transfer in- 
volves completion of medical history, nursing as- 
sessment form, and, in ideal circumstances within 
24 hours of hospital admission, a multidisciplinary 
discharge plan. Weekly discharge planning meet- 
ings further identify patient needs. A regional 
home care co-coordinator consults with the hos- 
pital team as required and may meet directly with 
patients and families. Immediately before dis- 
charge, a physician completes a referral for home 
care, and necessary services and supplies are com- 
municated to the home nursing agency. Usual 
home nursing care for CHF patients includes 
assessment and monitoring, health teaching, pro- 
vision of direct care, eg, administration of medica- 
tions, and managing equipment and treatments. 
Patients in the Transitional Care (TC) arm re- 
ceived the standard discharge planning and care, 
plus a comprehensive program, adding supports 
to improve the transfer from hospital to home. To 
develop this program, hospital and community 
nurses met to focus on the ‘outreach’ from the 
hospital and ‘in-reach’from the community during 
the transition. An intersectoral continuity of care 
framework19 guided their efforts in identifying 
gaps to specifically address 3 major aspects of a 

health services utilization for individuals admitted 
to hospital with heart failure. It was hypothesized 
that the enhanced transition process would im- 
prove quality of life and reduce emergency room 
visits and hospital admissions for individuals dis- 
charged from hospital with heart failure. 


All individuals admitted to two general medical 
units of a large urban teaching hospital in Ottawa, 
Ontario, Canada, with a diagnosis of congestive 
heart failure, were screened for the study. The two 
units were similar in size (35–37 beds), occupancy 
rates (90 –94%) and RN staffing (49 –51% full time, 
29 –33% permanent part-time). A centralized de- 
partment admitted patients to either unit, based 
solely on bed availability. Study inclusion criteria 
included: residing in the regional home care radius 
(60 km); expected to be discharged with home 
nursing care; English or French speaking; admit- 
ted for more than 24 hours to the nursing units; 
and, not cognitively impaired (score (cid:1)8 on Short 
Portable Mental Status Exam).17,18 The study re- 
ceived approval from the institutional Ethics Re- 
view Board of the Ottawa Civic Hospital and Loeb 
Health Research Institute. 

Using a computer-generated schedule, consent- 
ing patients were randomized by the research 
coordinator, within 24 hours of hospital admis- 
sion, to receive either Usual Care or Transitional 
Care. Prepackaged, 
consecutively numbered, 
sealed, opaque envelopes containing the group 
allocation were prepared for each nursing unit and 
administered from the research office. Neither the 
patients, nor the members of the study team, were 
aware of treatment assignment until after ran- 
domization. During hospitalization, the staff phy- 
sicians established the medical regimen. Other 
usual providers included hospital and community 
primary nurses and the home care coordinators. 
Usual discharge procedures are described and 
compared with Transitional Care in Table 1. With 
respect to usual discharge planning and postdis- 
charge care, patients in the control group received 
optimal usual care in that the timing and number

hospital-to-home transition: (1) supportive care 
for self-management; (2) linkages between hospi- 
tal and home nurses and patients; and (3) the 
balance of care between the patient and family 
and professional providers. The defining charac- 
teristics of TC were the use of a structured, com- 
prehensive, evidenced-based protocol for counsel- 
ing 
self- 
and planned 
management, plus 
linkages to support individuals in taking charge of 
aspects of their care. An evidence-based interven- 
tion is defined as care based by current research or, 
in the absence of strong empirical findings, on 
expert consensus. This may involve the use of 
professional practice standards and practice guide- 
lines, if available. 


The education-counseling protocol entitled, 
Partners in Care for Congestive Heart Failure 
(PCCHF), was developed in response to AHCPR 
guideline recommendations.4 PCCHF has two 
clinical components: (1) the patient workbook, 
and (2) an education map that provided the overall 
education plan, and serving as a patient-held 
documentation tool.20 –22 The workbook, a com- 
prehensive resource for self-management, pro- 
vides a structured approach for patient education, 
yet allows for tailoring to individual needs.20,21 It 
covers the basics of heart function and self-mon- 
itoring—what CHF means, management of med- 
ications, diet, exercise, stress, support systems, and 
community resources. There is a pocket for insert- 











ing patient-specific information (eg, medication, 
dietary handouts). Linkages, additional to usual 
practice, were created among providers and the 
patients including: a nursing transfer letter to the 
home care nurse detailing clinical status and self- 
management needs; a telephone outreach from 
the hospital nurse within 24 hours of discharge; 
notification to home care as to whom hospital 
primary nurse was for follow-up consult if neces- 
sary; and a patient-held documentation tool. 

The primary outcome was health-related qual- 
ity of life, symptom distress and function at 6- and 
12-weeks postdischarge, as measured by the Min- 
nesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire 
(MLHFQ), a condition specific instrument.23–25 
Secondary outcome measures included: quality of 
life measured with a generic measure, the Medical 
Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36),26 –29 and the 
number of all-cause emergency room visits and 
hospital readmissions. 
Hospital and home care clinical nursing staff 
delivered care to both the Usual Care and the TC 
groups. Two nurse research coordinators, reporting 
through the Clinical Epidemiology Unit, managed 
this trial. They were not connected in any way to 
either the hospital or home care departments, and 
wore research ID badges to avoid being mistaken 


The primary analysis tested the mean difference 
in the condition-specific quality of life outcome 
(MLHFQ) between baseline and 6 and 12 weeks 
postdischarge with the 2 study groups. Mean 
differences were compared using the independent 
t test with either the pooled or separate variance 
estimate as appropriate. To assess trends over 
time, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
compared each outcome across two factors: the 
cohort (usual care or TC) and time (baseline and 
after hospital discharge repeated measures). The 
importance was assessed using a mini- 
clinical 
mally clinical importance difference (MCID). The 
MCID was defined as a 5-point or greater change 
in the total MLHFQ score and 5% change in the 
physical and emotional dimension scores (2 points 
on the physical dimension score, 1.25 points on 
the emotional dimension score). The scores are 
calculated in whole numbers on a 5-point scale; 
therefore, the MCID for the emotional dimension 
was rounded upward to 2 points. Thus, a change of 
(cid:4) 2 points was classified as ‘no change’. This had 
the conservative effect of requiring a 12% deteri- 
oration in score to be in the ‘worse’ category. 



In the 18 months of study 
(June 1996 - January 1998), 483 patients with heart 
failure were admitted to the two study units. Once 
screened, 212 of these admissions were deemed 
eligible, and 200 individuals consented to partici- 
pate (5.6% refusal). Reasons for patient ineligibil- 
ity included: coming from or being discharged to a 
long-term care facility (n (cid:5) 104, 38%); living out- 
side the catchment area for home care (n (cid:5) 63, 
23%); too ill, or deceased, shortly after admission 
(n (cid:5) 40, 15%); first language other than French or 
English (n (cid:5) 33, 12%); being discharged (cid:1)24 
hours (n (cid:5) 16, 6%); diagnosis changed (n (cid:5) 8, 
3%); other (n (cid:5) 7, 3%). After hospital admission 
and baseline assessment, 8 of 200 consenting 
participants (5 Transitional Care, 3 Usual Care) did 
not subsequently enter the study after being ran- 
domized (4 because of death/becoming too ill, 2 
refusing home care, 1 change in diagnosis, 1 
discharge to long-term care). The ‘too ill’ category 
included being on life support, in palliative care or 
in intensive care. Of the 192 remaining patients, 
100 were randomly allocated to Usual Care and 92 


for 
coordinators 
screened and recruited the participants and col- 
lected baseline data. On admission, profile infor- 
mation was collected through chart audit using 
standardized forms for demographic and circum- 
stance of living data and clinical data, including 
previous admissions, comorbidities, and severity of 
medical problems from admitting notes and his- 
tory. Outcome data were collected within 24 hours 
of discharge (T1) and at two (T2), six (T3), and 12 
weeks (T4) after hospital discharge. Appointments 
in the home were made independent of scheduled 
home care visits. Patients had the option to com- 
plete the forms themselves or partake in a struc- 
tured interview with the research staff. The major- 
ity ((cid:2)90%) preferred the structured interview. 

The sample size was based on detecting a 
clinically important difference in the Minnesota 
Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. From 
changes in function and well-being experienced 
by patients in placebo controlled angiotensin con- 
verting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) trials, the devel- 
opers of the scale determined that 5 points (4.8%) 
was the minimally clinically important difference 
(MCID) in score.23,25,30,31 With the probability of a 
type I error set at 0.05 and power of 80%, 50 
patients per group were required to detect a 
5-point difference in the MLHFQ score, assuming 
a SD of 9 for the change scores (personal commu- 
nication, Thomas Rector, May 1996). Allowing for 
30% withdrawal because of death or study drop- 
out, and an additional 20% for sufficient statistical 
power to perform physical and emotional dimen- 
sion subscale analysis, 75 participants per group 
were required. 
Descriptive statistics (means, SD, proportions) 
were used to determine the characteristics of those 
completing the trial and the study dropouts. The 
success of randomization was determined by com- 
paring the intervention group with the Usual Care 
group profile on demographic and clinical vari- 
ables at baseline (T1) using (cid:3)2 test for categorical 
variables or the Student t test for continuous 
variables. 
Participants in the study were followed for 12 
weeks after hospital discharge. All those complet- 
ing outcome measures, whether they received the 
intervention, were included in the analyses to 
conduct an intention-to-treat/completer analysis. 


to the TC group. Before the 12-week study com- 
pletion, 20 people (11 Usual Care, 9 TC) died or 
became too ill before the 12 weeks of study 
completion, 8 withdrew (7 Usual Care, 1 TC), and 
7 were a loss to follow-up (5 Usual Care, 2 TC). 
Most of those randomized (81%, n (cid:5) 157) com- 
pleted the study. The ‘intent to treat/completer’ 
analysis was conducted on 157 participants who 
completed the outcome measures, whether they 
received treatment. 
The baseline profile (T1) of the study population 
after randomization (n (cid:5) 192) was one of a fairly 
elderly group. Less than 7% were under 60 years 
of age and the mean age was 76 years (median 77 
years, range 33–93 years). Most participants (91%) 
were retired or on disability pension, and nearly 
half lived alone. Most (76%) had at least some 
high school education. Nearly 80% had NYHA 
Functional Class4 III or IV as assessed by the nurse 
research coordinator on admission. On average, 
individuals took six prescription medications daily 
(Table 2). 
Comparability of Experimental and Control 
Participants. 
Profiles of those completing the study to 12 
weeks (n (cid:5) 157) and those who did not com- 
plete (n (cid:5) 35) were similar, with no statistically 
the demo- 
significant differences on any of 
graphic or clinical variables. A comparison of the 
clinical, social and demographic characteristics 
of 
the Usual Care and TC groups revealed 
well-balanced groups with no statistically sig- 
nificant differences in the baseline characteris- 
tics between the experimental and control par- 
ticipants (Table 2). A further comparison was 
made with these characteristics and the 157 
participants who completed the study, and 
again, no differences were found. 

With the primary outcome measure, the ML- 
HFQ, a lower score indicates less disability from 
symptoms (range 0 –105). The trend over time 
with the total MLHFQ score is one of continued 
improvement for the TC group (Fig. 1). The effect 
of hospitalization and the intervention are inter- 
twined at 2 weeks (T2). As expected, quality of life 
for participants in both groups improved at the 

2-week point (T2) as a hospital admission indi- 
cates a pressing need for medical 
intervention. 
Alleviation of the exacerbation precipitating the 
hospitalization would be expected to result in 
improvements, regardless of the group assign- 
ment. While those receiving usual care showed no 
further improvement at 6 and 12 weeks, the TC 
group showed both clinical and statistically signif- 
icant 
reported health- 
related quality of life (HRQL) (Table 3). The pat- 
tern was similar with the MLHFQ physical 
dimension score (Table 3). With the emotional 
dimension of the MLHFQ, TC group the scores 
improved significantly at T3 compared with base- 
line and were sustained at 12 weeks, compared 
with Usual Care participants who had no im- 
provement in this score at 6 or 12 weeks. 

Clinical Importance of the Quality of Life 
Improvements 
Relative changes in score between baseline and 
T4 (T1-T4, divided by T1) provide an indication of 
the clinical importance of the change in MLHFQ 
scores (Table 3). For instance, in the total MLHFQ 
scores at 12 weeks, the improvement from base- 
line for the TC group was 43% compared with 
14% for Usual Care group. With the physical 
dimension, the TC group improved 42% from 
baseline compared with 9% for Usual Care partic- 
ipants. Although having only borderline statistical 
significance, the relative change in score was 
greatest with the MLHFQ emotional dimension 
where improvement was 36% for the TC group, 
compared with less than 1% with Usual Care. 
To further understand the clinical importance of 
the differences in MLHFQ scores, the proportion 
of individuals in each group with a predefined 
MCID score at 6 and 12 weeks were tabulated. 
Classifying scores into ‘worse,’ ‘same,’ or ‘better’ 
revealed that, at 6 weeks, greater than 5 times the 
number of Usual Care patients had deteriorated 
(total MLHFQ) compared with the TC partici- 
pants. At 12 weeks, statistically significant differ- 
ences were seen in status, with TC improving in 
both the total MLHFQ and the physical and 
emotional dimensions (Table 4). 
The SF-36, the secondary quality of life out- 
come, included physical and mental component 
scales and a general health subscale (five items). A 
higher score indicates a better status with the 
SF-36 scales. Table 5 illustrates the scores at base-

the Usual Care group compared with 29% in the 
TC group ((cid:3)2 (cid:5) 4.86, df 1, P (cid:5) 0.03). Of those 
accessing the emergency room multiple times 
(range 1–5 visits), 50% of the Usual Care partici- 
pants had more than one visit, compared with 
32% of the TC group. 
During the 12-week trial there were fewer TC 
participants admitted to hospital (23%), compared 
with 31% of the Usual Care group ((cid:3)2 (cid:5) 0.28, df 1, 
P (cid:5) 0.26). The sample size was inadequate to 
detect this administratively and economically im- 
portant reduction in hospital readmission associ- 
ated with TC. 

Transitional Care resulted in improved CHF- 
specific quality of life for individuals hospitalized 
with heart failure and fewer subsequent visits to 
emergency rooms. This study demonstrated that 
with modest reorganization of discharge pro- 
cesses, and the provision of an evidence-based 
structure for patients and nurse providers to use 
for counseling and education,20 –22 significant 
gains can result. At 12-weeks after hospital dis- 
charge, compared with baseline TC participants 
were 13 points more improved in HRQL than 
Usual Care participants, ie, a 68% greater im- 
provement. Given the severity of illness of the 
participants, this is a clinically important gain for 
those receiving TC. Readmissions to hospitals 
were showing a trend to lower rates but the study 
was not powered to detect significant reductions 
in this area. Not only was TC effective, but these 
gains were achieved with no additional providers. 
Other trials7,10 –12,14 have reported positive find- 
ings from innovative, interdisciplinary, nurse-led 
approaches for discharge with the CHF population 
but, in these studies, a case management role was 
added. 
This trial is unique in that it was designed and 
powered using a HRQL measure as the primary 



outcome. Previous studies have focused on health 
service utilization as the primary outcome.7,10 –12,14 
Feeling better, as assessed by a specific HRQL 
measure (MLHFQ), was associated with signifi- 
cant changes in the use of emergency services. 
This highlights the importance of evaluating 
health services use in the context of self-reported 
well-being. The impact of “emotional symptoms” 
of individuals hospitalized with CHF is beginning 
to be recognized.13 This factor may be one of the 
most important in understanding and intercepting 
emergency room and hospital use by those with 
heart failure. 
Clinical practice guidelines offer one strategy to 
provide continuous, evidence-based care. Using a 
guideline across various health sectors provides a 
common script. With the CHF population, coordina- 
tion and supportive assistance for self-management 
with education are key recommendations,4 and im- 
proving hospital-to-home transition for patients 
with heart failure is a logical step in responding to 
current practice guidelines.4,9,13,32 This trial has dem- 
onstrated that with an aid, namely a patient booklet 
and education map, usual providers can deliver 
evidenced-based education and counseling across 
sectors of care. 
The experience in this study indicates the need 
for both a generic and specific HRQL outcome 
measure, an issue of continuing debate34 –37 The 
condition-specific HRQL measure (MLHFQ) was 
more sensitive to changes in this study than the 
generic measure (SF-36). A possible explanation is 
the difficulty for individuals to separate the con- 
tribution of particular co-morbidities to perceived 
deficits. For instance, is the lack of mobility or 
ability to assume normal social roles caused by 
CHF or to arthritis? This trial was focused on an 
intervention specific to CHF care; thus, alleviation 
of symptoms would be more evident with a 
condition-specific measure.33 Theoretically, be- 
cause of the nature of complex health populations 
having more than one prolonged condition, the 
use of a generic instrument is helpful in determin- 
im- 
ing overall HRQL. However, the potential 
provements on general quality of life with a CHF 
intervention in an elderly group, having more than 
three comorbidities, may have been diminished by 
the severity of their other conditions. More work 
on the application of condition-specific and ge- 
neric HRQL instruments with complex health 
populations is required. However, having a generic 
measure aids in the comparison of those with CHF 
to other complex populations receiving supportive 

interventions. Using both instruments in this trial 
did not present an undue burden of administra- 
tion with a fairly ill study population. 
Limitations of this trial relate to conducting the 
study in a naturalistic manner in the usual setting 
of care with usual providers. Hospital nurses pro- 
vided both experimental and control 
interven- 
tions. This was unavoidable and the only feasible 
means to conduct such a trial 
in the clinical 
setting, and not unduly disrupt service organiza- 
tion. There is a possibility of contamination with 
the hospital nurses providing Usual Care (control 
group) for, if the nurses were doing more than 
Usual Care, it would bias the results by decreasing 
the observed difference with TC. To assess the 
possible impact of this limitation, verification that 
the intervention happened and that the number of 
events in the TC differed from Usual Care was 
undertaken. Usual Care was likely made better by 
the study protocol, eg, early after hospital admis- 
sion, the process of assessment and home care 
notification was rigorously adhered to in both 
groups. Two home visits within the first 2 weeks 
after hospital discharge were ordered and pro- 
vided in both groups to account for attention 
effect. Consequently, Usual Care clients may have 
received extra care than may have been normally 
provided. Nevertheless, the effect from these ac- 
knowledged limitations would tend to minimize 
the difference in groups. Thus, any difference 
would be a true and underestimated difference 
attributable to the experimental maneuver. Blind- 
ing was not 100% assured. Patients may have 
inadvertently alerted the research coordinators of 
their assignment to Usual Care or Transitional 
Care either verbally or through the conspicuous 
presence of the PCCHF patient booklet. However, 
because the standardized outcome assessment 
(MLHFQ, SF-36) were standardized self-reports, 
we were reasonably confident that, even if assign- 
ment was exposed, there was little chance for 
impact on outcome results. Lastly, with multiple 
interventions it is not easy to assess the relative 
contribution of each component, nor the synergis- 
tic effect of the sum of the parts. With TC, the 
linkage aspects and supportive care for self- 
management were inextricably intertwined. 
A note on generalizability of the study is perti- 
nent. This trial was conducted in an urban center 
after discharge from a teaching hospital. The gen- 
eral medical units served a wide range of heart 
failure admissions including the elderly. The inter- 
vention was acceptable to most whom the pro-

gram applied (94%), and 81% completed the 
protocol. The length of follow-up (3 months) was 
comparable to other trials. The patients in the trial 
were ill with 77% having Stage III or IV NYHA 
class, and most being elderly (median 77 years). It 
is not known if similar results would be found with 
a younger, less advanced CHF population. 
Further research is needed. From a health services 
perspective, guideline-driven interventions are an 
important strategy to provide evidence-based care 
and improve continuity. As seen in this study, the 
impact of such an intervention had no effect on 
general HRQL, yet demonstrated dramatic results on 
condition-specific HRQL. The next step will be in 
evaluating ways to tailor standard approaches to 
patients by considering their full range of comorbid 
conditions and social circumstances. Secondly, future 
trials of CHF hospital transition interventions should 
address the long-term care sector. Nearly 40% of 
those not eligible for this trial were from long-term 
care settings. Implications about outcome measure- 
ment in health service trials of reorganization of 
supportive care fall into two areas: (1) greater use of 
self-reported measure versus measures previously 
considered more objective, ones such as clinical 
endpoints or health services utilization; and (2) use 
of both a condition-specific and generic HRQL 
instrument. Ultimately, the examination of economic 
data in the context of self-reported, well-being data 
will greatly enhance our understanding of health 
service utilization. Lastly, components of the TC 
intervention, particularly the PCCHF educational- 
counseling approach, should be evaluated in settings 
other than a teaching facility eg, primary care, com- 
munity programs, and with individuals at earlier 
stages of heart failure. 

In conclusion, Transitional Care has an impor- 
tant role to play in altering the course of patients 
hospitalized with heart failure. Our results suggest 
that with modest adjustments to usual discharge 
and transition from hospital-to-home, patients 
with CHF can experience improved quality of life, 
and decreased use of emergency rooms, for 3 
months after hospitalization. This approach will 
provide the needed adjunct to current manage- 
ment of heart failure. It may also have application 
in the management of other complex medical 
populations associated with frequent hospital use.
