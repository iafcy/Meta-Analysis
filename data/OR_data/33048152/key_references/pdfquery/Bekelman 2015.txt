IMPORTANCE Heart failure (HF) has a major effect on patients’ health status, including their 
symptom burden, functional status, and health-related quality of life. 
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of a collaborative care patient-centered disease 
management (PCDM) intervention to improve the health status of patients with HF. 
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Patient-Centered Disease Management (PCDM) 
trial was a multisite randomized clinical trial comparing a collaborative care PCDM 
intervention with usual care in patients with HF. A population-based sample of 392 patients 
with an HF diagnosis from 4 Veterans Affairs centers who had a Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire (KCCQ) overall summary score of less than 60 (heavy symptom burden and 
impaired functional status and quality of life) were enrolled between May 2009 and June 2011. 
INTERVENTIONS The PCDM intervention included collaborative care by a multidisciplinary 
care team consisting of a nurse coordinator, cardiologist, psychiatrist, and primary care 
physician; home telemonitoring and patient self-management support; and screening and 
treatment for comorbid depression. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in the KCCQ overall 
summary score at 1 year (a 5-point change is clinically significant). Mortality, hospitalization, 
and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9) were secondary outcomes. 
RESULTS There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between patients 
randomized to the PCDM intervention (n = 187) vs usual care (n = 197); baseline mean KCCQ 
overall summary scores were 37.9 vs 36.9 (P = .48). There was significant improvement in the 
KCCQ overall summary scores in both groups after 1 year (mean change, 13.5 points in each 
group), with no significant difference between groups (P = .97). The intervention was not 
associated with greater improvement in the KCCQ overall summary scores when the effect 
over time was estimated using 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month data (P = .74). Among 
secondary outcomes, there were significantly fewer deaths at 1 year in the intervention arm 
(8 of 187 [4.3%]) than in the usual care arm (19 of 197 [9.6%]) (P = .04). Among those who 
screened positive for depression, there was a greater improvement in the Patient Health 
Questionnaire 9 scores after 1 year in the intervention arm than in the usual care arm (2.1 
points lower, P = .01). There was no significant difference in 1-year hospitalization rates 
between the intervention arm and the usual care arm (29.4% vs 29.9%, P = .87). 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This multisite randomized trial of a multifaceted HF PCDM 
intervention did not demonstrate improved patient health status compared with usual care. 





hospitalization, and death in the Veterans Affairs (VA) 
system and the United States as a whole.1,2 It has a ma- 
jor effect on patients’ health status, defined as their symp- 
tom burden, functional status, and health-related quality of 
life. To date, few HF interventions have specifically targeted 
these critical patient-centered outcomes.2-4 
Disease management, variously defined,5 has been pro- 
moted as a strategy to improve outcomes of patients with HF. 
It usually refers to multidisciplinary efforts to improve the qual- 
ity and cost-effectiveness of care for selected patients with 
chronic conditions. These programs involve interventions de- 
signed to improve adherence to scientific guidelines and treat- 
ment plans.6 However, the association between HF disease 
management and outcomes is inconsistent.4,7-12 Heart failure 
disease management interventions have often relied solely on 
nurse case management. 
We developed the Patient-Centered Disease Manage- 
ment (PCDM) intervention to address these shortcomings by 
combining multidisciplinary collaborative care, home telem- 
onitoring, and depression management. Multidisciplinary col- 
laborative care has been shown to be effective in diabetes melli- 
tus, hypertension, lipid level, and depression management.13,14 
Home telemonitoring in isolation has not improved outcomes.15 
However, integrating home telemonitoring with multidisci- 
plinary collaborative care team management may improve out- 
comes through the provision of actionable, guideline-based 
treatment recommendations tailored to individual patients. To 
date, no studies have targeted improving patient health sta- 
tus as a primary outcome or addressed key barriers such as co- 
morbid depression. It is important to assess and manage de- 
pression in HF because depression is associated with poor 
treatment adherence, health status, and other outcomes.4,16,17 
Finally, to our knowledge, the effectiveness of disease man- 
agement for HF has not previously been evaluated in the De- 
partment of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated health care 
system in the United States. 
The multisite PCDM trial evaluated the combination of 
multidisciplinary collaborative care, telemonitoring, and joint 
HF and depression management. The primary aim was to de- 
termine whether the intervention resulted in better patient 
health status (ie, symptom burden, functional status, and qual- 
ity of life) than usual care. The secondary aims were to deter- 
mine whether the disease management intervention re- 
sulted in reduced hospitalizations, depressive symptoms, or 
mortality. 

Setting and Population 
The methods of the PCDM trial have been previously 
described.18 The study was conducted at the VA medical cen- 
ters in Denver, Colorado, Palo Alto, California, Richmond, Vir- 
ginia, and Seattle, Washington, as well as at their affiliated com- 
munity-based outpatient clinics. All patients with an assigned 
VA primary care physician and at least 1 primary care visit dur- 
ing the prior 12 months with a HF diagnosis code in the VA elec- 
tronic health record were screened for eligibility to partici- 
pate. Following previously described case finding methods,19 
the study was designed to target all patients with a diagnosis 
of HF, irrespective of the type of HF (eg, including those with 
and without preserved left ventricular systolic function). There- 
fore, the diagnosis of HF was defined as meeting any 1 of the 
following 5 criteria: (1) a primary inpatient hospital discharge 
diagnosis of HF (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision [ICD-9] code 428.XX); (2) at least 2 secondary inpa- 
tient hospital discharge diagnoses of HF (ICD-9 codes 428.XX) 
and a primary inpatient hospital discharge diagnosis related 
to heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410.XX, 412.XX, 413.XX, and 
414.XX); (3) at least 3 secondary inpatient hospital discharge 
diagnosis codes related to HF; (4) at least 2 outpatient visit di- 
agnoses of HF, excluding emergency department visits; and 
(5) at least 2 secondary inpatient hospital discharge diagno- 
ses of HF and at least 1 outpatient HF diagnosis.19 
Potentially eligible patients were screened with the Kan- 
sas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) to identify pa- 
tients with a diagnosis of HF and reduced health status. Indi- 
viduals scoring less than 60 on the KCCQ overall summary score 
(indicating significant HF symptoms, limited functional sta- 
tus, and poor quality of life) were invited to an enrollment visit 
if they did not have any exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria 
were (1) severe cognitive or psychiatric impairment; (2) cur- 
rent residence in a nursing home; (3) irreversible, noncardiac 
medical conditions likely to affect 6-month survival or ability 
to execute the study protocol (eg, metastatic cancer); (4) prior 
heart transplantation; and (5) alcohol abuse as indicated by the 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test20 score of at least 7. 
At enrollment, eligible patients provided written in- 
formed consent, completed baseline survey measures, and 
were then randomized to the PCDM intervention or to usual 
care. The study database was used to create the randomiza- 
tion sequence using block randomization, with stratification 
by study site and 1:1 randomization of patients to the inter- 
vention and to usual care. The randomization sequence was 
concealed from the study personnel. Randomization oc- 
curred after baseline survey information was entered into the 
database. The study was approved by the institutional re- 
view boards at each of the study sites. The full study protocol 
can be found in the trial protocol in the Supplement. 
PCDM Intervention 
The intervention included 3 components. These were multi- 
disciplinary collaborative care HF disease management, screen- 
ing for and treatment of depression, and telemonitoring with 
patient self-care support. 
Collaborative Care 
Each site had a collaborative care team consisting of a nurse 
coordinator (registered nurse), a primary care physician, a 
cardiologist, and a psychiatrist. For each intervention patient, 
the team reviewed the electronic health record and baseline 
depression scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 
(PHQ-9). The team recommended care changes for a given 
patient in accord with the American College of Cardiology 
and American Heart Association Guidelines for the Diagnosis

and Management of Heart Failure in Adults21 and the collab- 
orative depression care intervention as described herein. In 
addition, the team met weekly to recommend care changes 
based on review of telemonitoring data and the follow-up 
PHQ-9 scores. Collaborative care team recommendations 
were entered into a progress note and written as unsigned 
orders in the electronic medical record for review and signa- 
ture by the patient’s primary care physician. This method 
was successfully used in a prior VA intervention study22 for 
angina, with a high rate of acceptance of the recommenda- 
tions by VA primary care physicians. 
Screening and Treatment of Depression 
Intervention patients who screened positive for depression 
(PHQ-9 score, ≥10) received the depression care component 
of the intervention, adapted from a successful collaborative 
depression care intervention.23 This included (1) up to 11 ses- 
sions of behavioral activation and antidepressant manage- 
ment, provided by the nurse coordinator and supervised by 
the team psychiatrist; (2) a depression educational video; 
and (3) depression assessment and self-management educa- 
tion via telemonitoring. Before enrollment began, the nurse 
coordinator from each site participated in a 2-day training on 
depression and behavioral activation by the lead study psy- 
chiatrist (M.D.S.) and 4 weekly follow-up calls with the lead 
study psychiatrist. Thereafter, the nurse was supervised by 
the site psychiatrist via as-needed calls with the lead psy- 
chiatrist and Dr Bekelman. The depression care component 
of the nurse intervention was standardized in a treatment 
manual that described detailed procedures for what to dis- 
cuss with patients. 
Telehealth Telemonitoring and Patient Self-care Support 
Intervention patients received daily telemonitoring using 
home-based equipment that tracked signs and symptoms of 
HF and depression. The system collected daily measures of 
blood pressure, pulse, weight, and self-reported symptoms (eg, 
shortness of breath and edema). Patients with depression were 
asked questions about their mood and behavior. The telem- 
onitoring system assigned a risk to each response on the sys- 
tem. The nurse reviewed medium risk indicators and de- 
cided whether an action needed to be taken (eg, for patients 
unable to understand a low sodium diet, the nurse provided 
counseling). The nurse acted on all of the high risk indicators 
by contacting the patient for assessment and then, if neces- 
sary, contacted the care team for any changes in medications 
or tests to be written in the electronic medical record. For ex- 
ample, the collaborative care team could set and change an in- 
dividual patient’s dry weight and recommend a diuretic dos- 
ing guideline to primary care physicians. 
The self-care programs included medication reminders to 
promote adherence, education about HF and depression, medi- 
cation monitoring, and dietary advice. Patients were taught the 
importance of daily self-weighing, adherence to a low so- 
dium diet and medication regimens, and recognition of early 
signs and symptoms of HF decompensation. Adherence of 
nurses and the collaborative care team to the study protocol 
was not formally measured. 
Usual Care 
Patients randomized to the usual care arm continued to re- 
ceive care from their regular health care professionals and regu- 
lar telehealth nurses (if enrolled in telemonitoring), with no 
involvement of the study collaborative care team. Care was 
fully at the discretion of the patient’s regular health care pro- 
fessionals and may or may not have included cardiology or 
mental health clinic care in addition to primary care. Usual care 
patients were given information sheets at the enrollment visit 
that described self-care for HF and were provided with a weigh- 
ing scale if needed. Primary care physicians were notified if 
usual care patients screened positive for depressive symp- 
toms based on the initial study surveys. From then on, pa- 
tients’ primary care physicians assumed responsibility for de- 
pression care. 
Outcome Measures 
The primary outcome, patient-reported HF-specific health sta- 
tus, was measured using the KCCQ. This questionnaire is valid, 
reliable, and sensitive to clinical change and predicts hospital- 
ization and mortality.24-26 For the secondary measures, depres- 
sion was measured using the PHQ-9. This questionnaire is a valid 
and reliable instrument that provides a continuous measure of 
depressive symptoms.27 Baseline survey measures were col- 
lected in person. A research assistant (who was blinded to the 
randomization arm) collected 3-month and 6-month follow-up 
study outcome measures by phone or in person. The nurse co- 
ordinator collected measures at 12 months by phone or in per- 
son. Mortality and hospitalizations were assessed through VA 
databases, supplemented by patient self-report. Vital status was 
also ascertained via the VA Vital Status File, which has a sen- 
sitivity of 98.3% and a specificity of 99.8% compared with the 
National Death Index.28 
Sample Size and Enrollment Targets 
The primary hypothesis of this study was that patients with 
HF receiving the PCDM intervention would have greater im- 
provement in health status over a 12-month follow-up period 
compared with those receiving usual care. The minimal clini- 
cally meaningful difference in the KCCQ overall summary 
scores is 5 points,26 and the SD of change in the KCCQ overall 
summary scores was estimated to be 15 to 20 points based on 
previous work.25,26 With an estimated attrition rate of 30%, we 
originally estimated that enrollment of 600 patients would 
yield greater than 80% power to detect a difference in the KCCQ 
overall summary scores of at least 5 points, assuming an SD of 
18. A lower than expected enrollment was partially offset by a 
greater than expected retention rate (attrition, <20%). The 
KCCQ SD was 15 points. Hence, the study recruitment con- 
cluded with enrollment of 392 patients, with an estimated 
greater than 80% power to detect a 5-point difference in the 
KCCQ overall summary scores between groups. 
Statistical Analysis 
All primary and secondary analyses were conducted using an 
intent-to-treat approach. Baseline characteristics of patients 
were assessed by study group using t tests for continuous vari- 
ables and χ2 tests for categorical variables. For the primary out-

come, change in the KCCQ overall summary scores from base- 
line to 1 year between the intervention and usual care groups 
among patients who had both baseline and 1-year KCCQ over- 
all summary scores was compared using a paired t test. In ad- 
dition, a likelihood-based random-effects model was per- 
formed to compare change in the KCCQ overall summary scores 
over time between arms to account for missing data and lon- 
gitudinal trends.29 The magnitude and patterns of missing data 
were analyzed to confirm the validity of model assumptions. 
Model parameters were estimated using the MIXED proce- 
dure (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc). Changes in depres- 
sive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores) were analyzed among patients 
who screened positive for depression (PHQ-9 score, ≥10) using 
the same mixed modeling approach. The numbers of all- 
cause hospitalizations and deaths at 12 months were com- 
In total, 392 patients were randomized between May 2009 and 
June 2011 (Figure 1). The study population was mostly male 
(96.6%) and of white race/ethnicity (81.8%), with a mean age 
of 68 years, typical of the US veteran population (Table 1). Par- 
ticipants had comorbidities common in HF, including diabe- 
tes mellitus (50.0%), prior myocardial infarction (40.6%), 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (30.2%), and obstruc- 
tive sleep apnea (43.8%). Thirty-eight percent had ejection frac- 
tion of less than 40%. At baseline, the mean KCCQ overall sum- 
mary scores were 37.9 in the intervention group and 36.9 in the 
usual care group (P = .48), indicating high symptom burden 
and poor functional status and quality of life. Follow-up rates 
were good, with primary outcome assessments completed in 
89.8% (352 of 392) of participants at month 3, in 84.4% (331 of 
392) of participants at month 6, and in 86.0% (337 of 392) of 
participants at month 12. 
The individual patient KCCQ overall summary score tra- 
jectories for patients in the intervention and usual care arms 
over the study period are shown in Figure 2. After 1 year, the 
mean KCCQ overall summary score had increased by 13.5 
points for both the intervention and control groups (P = .97). 
The intervention was not associated with greater improve- 
ment in the KCCQ overall summary scores when the effect 
over time was estimated using the 3-month, 6-month, and 
12-month data (P = .74). Model-estimated KCCQ overall sum- 
mary scores in the intervention and usual care arms, respec- 
tively, were 43.8 (95% CI, 42.3-45.4) and 43.7 (95% CI, 42.1- 
45.2) at 90 days, 47.2 (95% CI, 45.5-48.9) and 46.9 (95% CI, 
45.2-48.6) at 180 days, and 54.2 (95% CI, 51.7-56.6) and 53.6 
(95% CI, 51.1-56.0) at 365 days. There were no harmful 
adverse events attributed to the intervention. 
Among secondary outcomes, there were significantly fewer 
deaths at 1 year in the intervention arm (8 of 187 [4.3%]) than 
in the usual care arm (19 of 197 [9.6%]) (P = .04); the number 
needed to treat was 20 (95% CI, 10-307). Fewer patients died 
in the intervention arm over time (P = .04, log-rank test). There 
was no significant difference in 1-year hospitalization rates be- 
tween the intervention arm and the usual care arm (29.4% vs 
29.9%, P = .87) or in time to hospitalization between groups. 
Among those who screened positive for depression, there was 
greater improvement in the PHQ-9 score after 1 year in the in- 
tervention arm than in the usual care arm (2.1; 95% CI, 0.43- 
3.78 points lower; P = .01). Of the recommendations made by 
the collaborative care teams, 75.7% were accepted by pri- 
mary care physicians (Table 2). 

In this multisite randomized clinical trial of 392 patients with 
HF and poor health status, we found that the multifaceted 
PCDM intervention did not significantly improve the primary

outcome of patient-reported health status in HF compared with 
usual care. Patient health status significantly improved over 
time in both the intervention and usual care cohorts. Among 
secondary outcomes, there were fewer deaths among the in- 
tervention group and reduced depressive symptoms among 
those who screened positive for depression. With the PCDM 
intervention, no differences were observed in hospitaliza- 
tion rates. 
The PCDM intervention was unique among disease man- 
agement interventions because of its primary outcome focus 
on patient health status and because it added depression care 
to other typical disease management components and used 
multidisciplinary collaborative care combined with telemoni- 
toring. Prior studies30-41 evaluating the effect of HF disease 
management programs on health status or quality of life have 
yielded mixed results, and health status was often a second- 
ary outcome. While we cannot determine why the PCDM in- 
tervention was unsuccessful in improving patient health sta- 
tus compared with usual care, several reasons are possible. 
First, the intervention may simply not be effective against the 
background of current usual, or standard, HF care in the VA 
system. Second, while the intervention was structured and 
fully specified for implementation, it was not possible to guar- 
antee strict implementation of all components. For example, 
we did not audio record and review the nurse counseling ses- 
sions for fidelity to the intervention. While many of the col-

the original studies were small, single-center trials.42,43 Dis- 
ease management interventions are heterogeneous and 
complex, and it can be difficult to distinguish the effect of 
intervention components from the effect of the skilled and 
motivated staff who conduct the intervention. Telemonitor- 
ing, a key component of many HF disease management 
interventions, was shown in a 2010 study15 to be ineffective, 
contradicting the findings of a prior meta-analysis. It may be 
that different disease management components are needed 
for different outcomes (eg, health status, hospitalization, 
and mortality). 
The reduction in mortality associated with the intervention 
has been found in other studies of disease management 
interventions.43 However, because mortality was a secondary 
outcome herein, we believe that it would be inappropriate to 
infer that the PCDM intervention led to reduced mortality. 
Rather, we view this finding as hypothesis generating, imply- 
ing the need for future studies adequately powered to detect 
a difference in mortality as a primary outcome. 
The improvement in health status in both arms of the 
trial has some implications. First, this finding shows the 
importance of examining the efficacy of disease management 
interventions using a randomized study design. Evaluating 
this intervention using a pre-post study design would have 
found an improvement in health status more than twice the 
minimal clinically meaningful change, the same improve- 
ment observed in the usual care arm. Second, it underscores 
challenges in studying a population with poor health status 
because some of the improvement in health status in both 
arms may have been due to natural variance or regression to 
the mean. 
There are several limitations to this study. We were un- 
able to blind participants to the intervention. Because the study 
was conducted among the population of US veterans, the re- 
sults may not be generalizable to other health systems and 
populations. Additional data on aspects of implementation of 
the intervention may have informed why the intervention did 
not improve health status compared with usual care. 

In conclusion, the multifaceted PCDM intervention for 
patients with HF did not improve HF health status compared 
with usual care. This study adds to the existing literature by

laborative care team recommendations were accepted, some 
were not, and this may have limited the effectiveness of the 
intervention. Third, because several recommendations were 
for consultations and diagnostic testing, it may take longer than 
the 1-year study period to see changes in health status. Fourth, 
while the depression intervention resulted in an improve- 
ment in depressive symptoms, the improvement may have 
been too small to improve the health status. An improvement 
of 2.1 points in the PHQ-9 score is below the minimally impor- 
tant difference of 5 points. Future studies of disease manage- 
ment interventions could consider additional implementa- 
tion process data to capture aspects of implementation such 
as the number and quality of contacts with the care coordina- 
tor, physiological monitoring, medication adherence, or self- 
management. 
This study raises questions about the effectiveness and 
cost-effectiveness of disease management interventions 
in the current health care environment. While systematic 
reviews and meta-analyses have shown reduced hospitaliza- 
tions and occasionally reduced mortality from disease man- 
agement, there is heterogeneity in the results, and many of

leaving open questions about the effectiveness and cost- 
effectiveness of disease management and telemonitoring 
interventions for patients with HF. Fewer deaths were 
observed in the intervention arm of this trial, and this find- 
ing may merit further study in another investigation. While 
there is significant enthusiasm for disease management pro- 
grams in HF, rigorous evaluation of these programs contin- 
ues to be necessary.
