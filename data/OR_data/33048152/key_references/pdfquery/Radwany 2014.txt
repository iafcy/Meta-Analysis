The speciﬁc aim of the PEACE pilot study was to determine the feasibility of a fully powered study to test the 
effectiveness of an in-home geriatrics/palliative care interdisciplinary care management intervention for im- 
proving measures of utilization, quality of care, and quality of life in enrollees of Ohio’s community-based long- 
term care Medicaid waiver program, PASSPORT. This was a randomized pilot study (n = 40 intervention [IG], 
n = 40 usual care) involving new enrollees into PASSPORT who were > 60 years old. This was an in-home 
interdisciplinary chronic illness care management intervention by PASSPORT care managers collaborating with a 
hospital-based geriatrics/palliative care specialist team and the consumer’s primary care physician. This pilot was 
not powered to test hypotheses; instead, it was hypothesis generating. Primary outcomes measured symptom 
control, mood, decision making, spirituality, and quality of life. Little difference was seen in primary outcomes; 
however, utilization favored the IG. At 12 months, the IG had fewer hospital visits (50% vs. 55%, P = 0.65) and 
fewer nursing facility admissions (22.5% vs. 32.5%, P = 0.32). Using hospital-based specialists interfacing with a 
community agency to provide a team-based approach to care of consumers with chronic illnesses was found to be 
feasible. Lack of change in symptom control or quality of life outcome measures may be related to the tools used, 
as these were validated in populations closer to the end of life. Data from this pilot study will be used to calculate 
the sample size needed for a fully powered trial. (Population Health Management 2014;17:106–111) 


Medicaid spending.1 As the population ages, the per- 
centage of the population with chronic illnesses is going to 
increase.2 The US health care system, as currently structured, 
is not able to accommodate the needs of vast numbers of 
chronically ill patients, nor is it able to sustain the current level 
of spending.3 For too long, the emphasis in chronic illness care 
has been on acute episodic care rather than a more balanced 
approach that includes prevention, symptom control, self- 
management support, care coordination, and collaborative 
community integration, with the consumer’s goals driving 
care decisions. We now know that the lack of care coordina- 
tion and poor communication of advance care wishes that 
characterize the current system lead to avoidable health care 
utilization and diminished quality of life.4,5 Numerous dem- 
onstration projects and research studies have attempted to 
improve care coordination; however, they have produced 
mixed results.6 
This article reports the outcomes of the Promoting Effec- 
tive Advance Care for Elders (PEACE) randomized pilot 
study.7 PEACE was an in-home, interdisciplinary, evidence- 
based care management 
intervention delivered by Area 
Agency on Aging (AAA) care managers, who coordinate 
consumers’ care with a health system-based geriatrics/pal- 
liative care interdisciplinary team and the consumer’s pri- 
mary care physician (PCP). PEACE targeted new dual 
eligible enrollees in Ohio’s community-based, long-term care 
Medicaid waiver program, PASSPORT. The term dual eli- 
gible refers to those consumers who are eligible for both 
Medicare and Medicaid beneﬁts. This intervention differs 
from the previous care management literature in that (1) the 
interventions are delivered in the home by community-based

long-term care providers who are already familiar with the 
consumers, (2) the interventions are informed by recom- 
mendations from a combined geriatrics/palliative care in- 
terdisciplinary team from a neighboring acute care hospital 
that is part of an integrated health system, and (3) the inter- 
ventions are carried out in collaboration with the consumer’s 
PCP. An emphasis on symptom management, medication 
reconciliation, consumer activation for self-management, goal 
setting, and coaching for completion of advance care plan- 
ning characterize the PEACE intervention. 


The theoretical framework for the PEACE study has been 
published previously.7 Brieﬂy, Wagner et al8 theorize that 
optimal care for patients with chronic illness is not possible 
in a traditional health care system that focuses on acute ill- 
ness care, because primary care providers have limited time 
to provide the necessary systematic assessments, preventive 
interventions, patient education, and psychosocial follow- 
up.9–12 Furthermore, when patients transition from one care 
setting to another (eg, from the acute care hospital to am- 
bulatory care), there is little or no communication between 
providers, creating confusion about the appropriate plan of 
care, as well as little emphasis on patient activation for self- 
care and consumer-directed goal setting. According to 
Wagner’s model, improvement in the care of patients with 
chronic conditions can be brought about only when speciﬁc 
changes occur in the health care delivery system, including 
changes in organizational structure, establishing community 
linkages/partnerships, providing effective self-management 
support and activation, delivery system redesign, evidence- 
based decision support, and improved information systems. 
The PEACE study incorporates the elements of Wagner’s 
model with a palliative care focus and application of geriatric 
medicine principles into a community-based, chronic illness 
management model. 


The study included all new PASSPORT enrollees > 60 
years old who passed a mental status screening (the Mental 
Status Questionnaire28) and had one of the following: con- 
gestive heart failure and being actively treated (American 
Heart Association stage C); chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease and on home oxygen; diabetes with renal disease, 
neuropathy, visual problems, or coronary artery disease; 
end-stage liver disease or cirrhosis; cancer (active, not history 
of ) except skin cancer; renal disease and actively receiving 
dialysis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with history of aspi- 
ration; Parkinson’s disease stages 3 and 4; or pulmonary 
hypertension. These criteria were established by expert 
consensus and were chosen so that the intervention was 
targeted at those whose illness severity made it more likely 
that they would beneﬁt from this geriatrics/palliative care 
those who drink > 2 
intervention. Active alcoholics (ie, 
drinks per day on average) and illegal substance users were 
excluded, as well as clients who have schizophrenia or are 
psychotic. These consumers were excluded because the au- 
thors’ previous care management trials have shown that 
these other conditions tend to dominate the person’s life and 
detract from their ability to participate in self-management 
activities. Consumers who could not pass the Mental Status 
Questionnaire were excluded because the intervention relies 
heavily on chronic illness self-management and the ability of 
an individual to make decisions about advance care wishes. 
Consumers who were already enrolled in hospice also were 
excluded. 

This study was approved by the Summa Health System 
Institutional Review Board. A more detailed description of 
the intervention was published previously.7 Brieﬂy, con- 
sumers were randomly assigned to specially trained PASS- 
PORT care managers or to usual PASSPORT care. Within 3 
weeks of enrollment into PASSPORT, consumers in the in- 
tervention group received the ﬁrst of 2 in-home geriatric/ 
palliative care biopsychosocial needs assessments. The PCP 
was informed by letter that his or her patient was in the 
study and asked whether the patient had few or many 
treatment options and whether the health care team was 
aware of the patient’s wishes. This helped the team get a 
more realistic picture of the patient’s medical status from the 
start. The second visit occurred within approximately 2 
weeks of the ﬁrst and concentrated on consumer goal setting. 
Within approximately 2 weeks of the second home visit, 
there was an interdisciplinary team meeting to review the 
ﬁndings of the care manager’s assessment. The core team in- 
cluded a hospice and palliative medicine specialist, a geria- 
trician, the PASSPORT care manager, a palliative care nurse 
specialist, a social worker, a spiritual advisor, and a pharma- 
cist. Extended team members, who were consulted as needed, 
included physical and occupational therapists, a dietitian, a 
geriatric advanced practice nurse, and a psychologist. The 
team developed individualized, evidence-based care plans 
based on standardized protocols that were developed for this 
study and derived from an extensive literature review13 that 
included the Assessing Care for Vulnerable Elders guide- 
lines,14 the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative 
Care,15 and the International Association of Hospice and Pal- 
liative Care Manual of Palliative Care.16 A copy of this care 
plan was sent to the consumer’s PCP. 
The PASSPORT care manager discussed the care plan 
with the consumer and family, when available, to ensure it 
accurately reﬂected the consumer’s goals. Once the con- 
sumer and family were in agreement, the PASSPORT care 
manager accompanied the consumer to a PCP visit solely 
intended to review the plan with the PCP, gain his or her 
buy-in, and provide ‘‘academic detailing.’’17 PCPs were re- 
imbursed as an incentive to participate with their patient in 
the trial. 
Once the care plan was agreed upon by all, the PASSPORT 
care manager made another home visit to implement the plan 
and to teach, activate, and coach the consumer and/or care- 
giver. This visit included teaching disease and symptom 
management, identifying symptom management needs, de- 
veloping an emergency response plan, addressing functional 
needs, teaching caregivers about disease/symptom manage- 
ment, assisting with access to community resources, referring 
to a counselor as needed for psychological support, assessing/ 
assisting with spiritual needs, addressing unmet medical 
needs, reviewing medications, facilitating client/PCP/family 
communication and completing legal documents recognized 


by the State of Ohio (ie, state Do Not Resuscitate and living will 
forms). The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment 
(POLST) also was completed, although it is not legally binding 
in Ohio. The decision was made to include it, in a slightly 
modiﬁed form, because of its superior information content and 
value in guiding advance care planning discussions. It was 
included in the information consumers were asked to com- 
municate to all health care providers. Consumers were pro- 
vided with written self-management materials. Caregiver 
needs also were assessed, when appropriate, using informal, 
open-ended questions, and community supports were mobi- 
lized to meet identiﬁed needs. Consumers had access to either 
the care manager or a hospital-based team member 24 hours/ 
day because acute exacerbations might otherwise prompt 
consumers to seek help in the emergency department.18 
The PASSPORT care manager followed up with the con- 
sumer by phone as needed, but at least monthly, for 12 
months to determine whether the goals of care had changed. 
If the consumer was re-hospitalized or if there was another 
inﬂection point in the trajectory of their chronic illness, the 
team assessment was updated and the goals of care were 
reevaluated. 

Consumers randomized to usual care received usual 
PASSPORT care, which follows more of a psychosocial ra- 
ther than a biopsychosocial model. A letter was sent to the 
PCP informing him or her that the consumer was enrolled in 
the study. Consumers also received mailed palliative care 
educational information every month in an attempt to mask 
group assignment.

ence between groups in activities of daily living or instru- 
mental activities of daily living at baseline. 
Over the course of the year, there were 7 deaths in the 
intervention group and 7 deaths in the usual care group. The 
number of days from enrollment to death was slightly longer 
in the intervention group (189 days) compared to usual care 
(150 days) but the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. 
Mean differences and 95% conﬁdence intervals for the pri- 
mary outcomes at 6 and 12 months are shown in Table 3. As 
would be expected in a feasibility study, all conﬁdence in- 
tervals included zero, 
indicating no signiﬁcant difference 
between groups. 
Table 4 shows the results of health care utilization at 12 
months. There were fewer consumers with hospital visits 
and nursing facility placements in the intervention group. 


Outcomes recommended by the Outcomes Workgroup of 
the US Cancer Pain Relief Committee19 were used for this 
pilot to promote ease of interpretation and aid in comparison 
of outcomes between studies. The intervention was expected 
to have a positive effect on these primary outcomes: 


2) Quality of life (measured with the QUAL-E)21,22 
3) Mood (measured with the Hospital Anxiety and De- 




Health care utilization data also were collected from the 
AAA database. Outcomes were measured by a research 
nurse blinded to group assignment. 

Forty consumers were randomized to the intervention 
group and 40 to usual care. Baseline characteristics of the 
PEACE population are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Chi-square 
was used to compare proportions and Student t test was 
used to compare means. No signiﬁcant difference was found 
in baseline demographics (Table 1). The difference in com- 
pletion of durable power of attorney approached signiﬁcance 
in favor of the intervention group. Table 2 shows no differ-

interagency care management intervention to improve ad- 
vance illness care in low-income, community-dwelling con- 
sumers with chronic illnesses who meet the criteria for 
nursing home placement and are enrolled in a community- 
based, long-term care Medicaid waiver program. Although 
this pilot was not powered to detect statistically signiﬁcant 
differences between groups, preliminary ﬁndings indicate a 
beneﬁt of the intervention regarding acute hospitalizations 
and long-term nursing facility placement at 12 months. 
This study has demonstrated the feasibility of the PEACE 
intervention with respect to the optimal stafﬁng conﬁgura- 
tion, ability of care managers to implement the intervention, 
functionality of the team, the optimal timing and frequency 
of contacts with consumers, willingness of PCPs to partici- 
pate and the ability to recruit, retain, and measure outcomes 
for these consumers. The appropriateness of the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria was conﬁrmed as well as the expected 
mortality rate. Most important, the study established the 
ability of acute care and community-based providers to 
collaborate successfully. 
Nonetheless, several issues were identiﬁed that will re- 
quire revision in a larger randomized trial. For example, this 
pilot study used outcome measures from the domains re- 
commended by the Outcomes Workgroup of the US Pain 
Relief Committee.26 The authors felt that the use of reliable 
and valid palliative care measures was important to maxi- 
mize the generalizability of the ﬁndings and to aid in com- 
parison with other studies.27 Furthermore, the authors felt 
that the comprehensive nature of the intervention required 
consideration of a broad range of outcomes (eg, quality of 
life, symptom control) in addition to more common mea- 
sures (eg, anxiety). Thus, the Memorial Symptom Assess-

ment Scale, QUAL-E, Meaning in Life Scale, Palliative 
Outcome Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale were measured. Feedback from care managers, pa- 
tients, and families revealed that most of these tools were 
more appropriate for hospital-based practice and evaluation 
of palliative care and not for an earlier, home-based geriat- 
ric/palliative care intervention. As a result, the authors rec- 
ommend that 
future studies focus on outcomes more 
reﬂective of the Triple Aim to achieve better care, better 
health, and lower cost 
(ie, medication appropriateness, 
health care utilization, patient activation, activities of daily 
living, and instrumental activities of daily living, hospice 
enrollment/place of death, consumer satisfaction, comple- 
tion of the modiﬁed POLST, spirituality, anxiety, depression, 
and quality of life). 
At the beginning of the study, when the AAA and mem- 
bers of the acute hospital team began meeting, there was fear 
that the added work of the study would overburden the care 
managers. Indeed, the care managers were supposed to have 
had their caseloads lightened during the study to accom- 
modate the extra work. Unfortunately, this did not happen. 
Nonetheless, the care managers carried out their study re- 
sponsibilities, though they had some difﬁculty in undertak- 
ing advance care planning discussions with the limited 
training they were provided. The authors believe that a 
better model would be to hire a single trained palliative care 
specialist care manager who could more easily assure that 
comprehensive assessments, consumer goal setting, and ad- 
vance care planning all take place. A better model also 
would ensure that care managers are trained through a for- 
mal training model such as the Respecting Choices29 certiﬁ- 
cation course. 
A formal cost-effectiveness analysis could not be under- 
taken because of the lack of access to the Medicare and 
Medicaid databases. Nonetheless, estimates of the ﬁnancial 
costs versus beneﬁts of the PEACE trial intervention can be 
derived from available data. The authors have proposed to 
build a better model for delivery of this intervention by 
hiring specially trained geriatrics/palliative care case man- 
agers. Each case manager could deliver the PEACE inter- 
ventions for an estimated 100 consumers per year, or 
approximately $75,000 in salary per 100 consumers ($750/ 
year/consumer or $62.50/month/consumer). In addition, all 
interdisciplinary team members participated in semiweekly 
team meetings that lasted 2 hours. Calculating the approxi- 
mate costs for all team members for 2 meetings per month 


totals $1600 per month ($19,200/year) for 100 consumers 
($192/year/consumer or $16/month/consumer). Thus, the 
total cost per consumer would be approximately $942/year 
or $78.50/month. Because investigators were not able to 
accurately record emergency department visits, days in the 
hospital, or days within a nursing facility (other than by 
reports from care managers), the estimates of health care 
costs must be based on these limited data. However, a 5% 
decrease in hospitalization and a 10% drop in nursing facility 
placements at 1 year were reported. An estimate of cost 
savings based on average cost data obtained from Summa 
Health System’s database can be derived from these num- 
bers. Speciﬁcally, if the average cost of a single hospital stay 
is $10,300, assuming only 1 hospital stay per year per 
consumer, then hospital costs for each consumer would be 
expected to be $10,300 per year. If the intervention reduces 
the number of hospitalizations by 5%, there would be a 
savings of $51,500 per year in the intervention group (n = 100; 
$515/consumer/year or $42.92/consumer/month). Like- 
wise, for costs of $5500 per month to care for a consumer in a 
nursing facility ($66,000/year), the 10% decrease seen in 
nursing facility placement in the intervention group would 
have resulted in a savings of $55,000/month or $660,000/ 
year ($550/consumer/month for 1 month in a nursing fa- 
cility to $6600/consumer/year for an entire year in a nursing 
facility). Thus, the overall cost of the intervention is esti- 
mated to be $942/consumer/year or $78.50/consumer/ 
month and the overall savings are estimated to range from 
$1065/consumer/year on average for 1 hospitalization and 
1 month in a nursing facility to $7115/consumer/year on 
average for 1 hospitalization and a 1-year stay in a nursing 
facility; there would be a difference in favor of the inter- 
vention ranging from $123/consumer/year 
to $6173/ 
consumer/year. 
A limitation of this study is the reliance on the AAA da- 
tabase for hospital admission and nursing facility admission 
data. The authors acknowledge that there may have been 
underreporting of hospital admissions because care manag- 
ers relied on consumers’ self-reports. However, the nursing 
facility admission data are completely accurate because 
nursing facility admission prompts initiation of discharge 
proceedings from the PASSPORT program. 
Study changes suggested by this pilot will be incorporated 
into the authors’ proposal for funding of a fully powered 
trial.
