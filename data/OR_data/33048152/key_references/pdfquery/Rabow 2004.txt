Background: Little is known about the use of pallia- 
tive care for outpatients who continue to pursue treat- 
ment of their underlying disease or whether outpatient 
palliative medicine consultation teams improve clinical 
outcomes. 
Methods: We conducted a year-long controlled trial in- 
volving 50 intervention patients and 40 control patients 
in a general medicine outpatient clinic. Primary care phy- 
sicians referred patients with advanced congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer 
who had a prognosis ranging from 1 to 5 years. In the in- 
tervention group, the primary care physicians received mul- 
tiple palliative care team consultations, and patients re- 
ceived advance care planning, psychosocial support, and 
family caregiver training. Clinical and health care utiliza- 
tion outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months. 
ter the intervention, intervention group patients had less 
dyspnea (P=.01) and anxiety (P=.05) and improved sleep 
quality (P=.05) and spiritual well-being (P=.007), but 
no change in pain (P=.41), depression (P=.28), quality 
of life (P=.43), or satisfaction with care (P=.26). Few pa- 
tients received recommended analgesic or antidepres- 
sant medications. Intervention patients had decreased pri- 
mary care (P=.03) and urgent care visits (P=.04) without 
an increase in emergency department visits, specialty clinic 
visits, hospitalizations, or number of days in the hospi- 
tal. There were no differences in charges (P=.80). 
Conclusions: Consultation by a palliative medicine team 
led to improved patient outcomes in dyspnea, anxiety, 
and spiritual well-being, but failed to improve pain or 
depression. Palliative care for seriously ill outpatients can 
be effective, but barriers to implementation must be ex- 
plored. 
Results: Groups were similar at baseline. Similar num- 
bers of patients died during the study year (P= .63). Af-

tives to improve pallia- 
care for patients at the end 
of life are well docu- 
mented, prompting initia- 
tive medicine for diverse patient populations 
across a wide variety of settings.1-4 Quality 
end-of-life care requires attention to the do- 
mains of physical, psychological, social, and 
spiritual well-being; advance care plan- 
ning; and preparation for death.5-7 Al- 
though hospice provides comprehensive 
end-of-life care, only one quarter of dying 
Americans use it.8 Hospice follows a tran- 
sition model of palliation, in which cura- 
tive attempts are abandoned in favor of com- 
fort care, largely by patients with diseases 
that have a relatively predictable clinical 
course, such as metastatic cancer. 
Most Americans, however, die of 
chronic illnesses without predictable prog- 
noses, such as chronic obstructive pul- 
monary disease (COPD) and congestive 
heart failure (CHF),9,10 often after suffer- 
ing with significant symptoms.11,12 The 
transition model of hospice care does not 
serve these patients well, as most do not 
want to choose between curative treat- 
ment and symptom relief.5,11,13-15 A broader 
model of palliative medicine would offer 
aggressive symptom management and 
comprehensive care to the large percent- 
age of outpatients with advanced illness 
who are still pursuing aggressive manage- 
ment or cure of their disease.16,17 Such out- 
patient palliative medicine has received 
little rigorous evaluation but may be- 
come increasingly relevant as the num- 
ber of elderly people living with serious 
chronic illness increases.18-23 
We conducted a controlled trial of an 
intervention in which an interdiscipli- 
nary team offered palliative medicine con-

sultation and direct services to outpatients, their fami- 
lies, and their primary care physicians (PCPs), in addition 
to usual primary care. In general, these patients were en- 
gaged in aggressive attempts to cure or manage disease 
and not necessarily considered to be at the end of life. 

We compared physical, psychological, social, and spiritual out- 
comes between an intervention group of patients receiving a 
multifaceted, outpatient, palliative medicine consultation in- 
tervention plus usual primary care and a control group receiv- 
ing only usual primary care.24 

The study was performed within the 70-physician general medi- 
cine practice of a tertiary care, university medical center lo- 
cated in a large urban setting and serving an ethnically diverse 
population. Patients are cared for by academic faculty and house 
staff, and generally are insured via Medicare or managed care 
organizations, with a minority of Medicaid or self-pay pa- 
tients. For administrative purposes, patients and physicians of 
the general medical practice are divided into 2 equivalent mod- 
ules (GMA and GMB) housed in the same building, but with 
separate waiting areas and nursing and clerical staff. 
On the basis of a coin flip, patients in one clinic module 
(GMA) were assigned to be the intervention group and pa- 
tients in the second module (GMB) were assigned to the con- 
trol group. Although individual patients were not randomized 
to the intervention, each patient’s initial assignment to the prac- 
tice modules was based only on appointment and space avail- 
ability at the time of enrollment, with no other differences in 
composition. Similarly, physicians are initially assigned to 1 of 
the 2 practice modules solely on the basis of space availability 
in the practice at the time of hiring. Physicians and patients 
assigned to one module did not cross over to the other; phy- 
sicians in the control module did not care for any patients in 
the intervention group and thus received no education or sup- 
port from the intervention team. 

We invited physicians in both practice modules to refer adult 
patients with diagnoses of cancer, advanced COPD, or ad- 
vanced CHF, whom they believed had a life expectancy of 1 to 5 
years and who were not yet ready for hospice care. To assist PCP 
recall of potentially eligible patients, we provided physicians with 
lists of all patients they had seen in the previous 3 months, as 
well as patients identified by computerized medical record or bill- 
ing data as having one of the relevant diagnoses. We invited all 
eligible patients referred by their PCP to participate. We ex- 
cluded patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers, dementia, or 
psychosis; those enrolled in hospice care; and those unable to 
complete a written survey in English or Spanish. The PCPs and 
patients were informed that GMA was assigned to the interven- 
tion arm and GMB to the control arm. Because they received no 
direct benefit from the study, control patients received partici- 
pation incentives with grocery store gift certificates. 

We provided all intervention patients with a newly developed 
1-year program delivered by an interdisciplinary palliative medi- 
cine team called the Comprehensive Care Team (CCT).24 The 
CCT was composed of a social worker, nurse, chaplain, phar- 
macist, psychologist, art therapist, volunteer coordinator, and 
3 physicians who addressed physical, emotional, and spiritual 
issues. All team members, except the volunteer coordinator, 
had expertise in palliative care. The program integrated PCP 
consultation, case management, volunteer and group support, 
chaplaincy consultation, and artistic expression.25-34 
The CCT intervention included 7 main components. First, 
consultation with PCPs was based on in-depth and follow-up 
patient assessments conducted by the social worker. Assess- 
ments were presented to the entire CCT at regularly sched- 
uled team meetings directed by one of the CCT physicians. The 
PCPs did not attend these CCT meetings but often had infor- 
mal discussions with the CCT social worker and physicians. 
At 3 points (study entry, midway, and study completion), the 
CCT developed recommendations that were offered to the pa- 
tient’s PCP via a written letter and e-mail. Recommendations 
were offered in the following 5 domains: physical symptoms, 
psychological well-being, social support, spiritual well-being, 
and advance care planning. The CCT physicians based their 
suggestions on information from validated patient surveys and 
the social worker assessment, but rarely directly interviewed 
or examined the patient. 
Second, the social worker provided case management and 
offered psychological support in person and by telephone. The 
social worker also encouraged patients to address issues of ad- 
vance care planning, including surrogate decision makers, prog- 
nosis, funeral arrangements, and wills. 


Fourth, a pharmacist performed a medical chart review of 
patient medications, looking in particular for drug-drug inter- 
actions and unnecessarily complex medication regimens. 


Sixth, patients and their families were invited to monthly 
support groups that included discussions about symptom man- 
agement and advance care planning, as well as art projects called 
“art experientials” (available at: http://dgim.ucsf.edu/cct 
/what_art_exp.htm) designed to explore emotions relating to 
illness and relationships. 
Seventh, medical and pharmacy students provided volun- 
teer patient support and advocacy through weekly telephone 
contacts with patients, monthly visits, and regular communi- 
cation with the CCT about patient needs.35 

After obtaining study approval from the University of Califor- 
nia, San Francisco Committee on Human Research and writ- 
ten informed consent from participating patients, we col- 
lected data from written patient surveys, retrospective review 
of the medical center’s computerized medical and billing 
records, and exit interviews with intervention patients. 

At study enrollment (time 1), 6 months (time 2), and 12 months 
(time 3), we collected data via a written questionnaire on func- 
tional status and multiple study outcomes (dyspnea, pain, sleep, 
anxiety, depression, spiritual well-being, quality of life, health 
care satisfaction, and advance care planning). A member of the 
CCT clinical team (for intervention patients) or research staff 
(for controls) brought the survey to the study subject at home 
or during a clinic visit and supervised its completion. The sur- 
vey was a compilation of previously validated instruments, as 
detailed below. 
Physical Functioning and Symptoms. The Rapid Disability Rat- 
ing Scale-236 provided a measure of patient functional status, 
with 18 items using a 4-point Likert scale. Scores can range from 





18 (no disability) to 72 (maximal disability). Dyspnea was mea- 
sured using the University of California, San Diego Shortness 
of Breath Questionnaire.37 This instrument, consisting of 2 sub- 
scales scored on a 5-point Likert scale, was developed for pa- 
tients with moderate-to-severe lung disease, and assesses dys- 
pnea during an average day during the past week. The first 21- 
item subscale measures the degree to which dyspnea interferes 
with various daily activities. The second 3-item subscale as- 
sesses the degree to which dyspnea limits daily life. Pain was 
assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory,38 which evaluates worst, 
least, average, and current pain during the last 24 hours, using 
a scale of 0 to 10. We also asked respondents to list current 
pain medications and treatments. Sleep quantity and quality 
were assessed using 6 sleep items from the Medical Outcomes 
Study.39 Sleep was assessed during the preceding 4 weeks and 
was scored on a 6-point Likert scale, with a higher score indi- 
cating better sleep. 
Psychosocial and Spiritual Well-being. Anxiety was assessed 
using the 6-item anxiety scale from the well-validated, 5-point 
Likert scale Profile of Mood States.40 Depressive symptoms were 
evaluated using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Stud- 
ies Depression Scale.41 Higher overall scores indicate greater 
depressive symptoms, with a cutoff score of 16 or greater iden- 
tifying cases of depression. Spiritual well-being was evaluated 
using the 20-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale,42 which includes 
an existential and a religious subscale. Quality of life was as- 
sessed using the Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale– 
Cancer Version,43 a 17-item, sex-specific instrument with an 
11-point Likert scale. Health care satisfaction was assessed with 
25 relevant items from the Group Health Association of America 
Consumer Satisfaction Survey.44 This instrument uses a 5-point 
Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction. 
Advance Care Planning. The questionnaire also asked pa- 
tients whether they had completed or considered a durable power 
of attorney for health care, funeral plans, and plans for dispo- 
sition of possessions after death. Patients responded with yes 
or no answers. 
We pretested the questionnaire with patients meeting in- 
clusion criteria in a different general medicine practice. The ques- 
tionnaire was then translated into Spanish and back- 
translated to ensure lexical equivalency by a professional 
bilingual medical researcher. High standardized (cid:1) coefficients 
(range, 0.75-0.98) provided evidence of good reliability of the 
individual survey instruments in this study population. Pa- 
tients could elect to complete the questionnaire in English or 
Spanish only; 1 patient chose the Spanish instrument. The ques- 
tionnaire required approximately 1 hour to complete. 
puterized billing system. At study completion, a trained re- 
search assistant reviewed the computerized billing record and 
identified all charges for office visits, emergency department 
visits, and hospital stays for all study participants during the 
study period. Medication, out-of-pocket, and outside hospital- 
ization charges were not obtained. 

Intervention patients completing the 1-year intervention par- 
ticipated in a semistructured exit interview with the CCT so- 
cial worker. Patients were asked about the timing of their in- 
troduction to the CCT, their level of satisfaction with the various 
elements of the CCT intervention, and the effect of the CCT 
on their relationships with their family, their PCP, and the medi- 
cal center. Patients were asked to provide yes or no responses 
and then, if they wished, to answer in greater detail. Finally, 
we obtained information about the location and setting of a pa- 
tient’s death from their PCP. 

We analyzed data from patients who completed all 3 surveys. 
All data were double entered and analyzed using the CRUNCH 
statistical program.45 
We addressed 2 questions for each clinical outcome us- 
ing the analysis of covariance statistic. We first determined 
whether there were significant group differences in mean out- 
come scores over time. Then, to account for the possibility that 
similar group means might be found only because outcomes 
improved over time for one group while worsening for the other, 
we conducted analyses of group(cid:2)time interactions. To con- 
trol for baseline group differences, we controlled for the time 
1 values by entering them as covariates in the analysis of co- 
variance equation. The adjusted means presented herein ac- 
count for the influence of the time 1 values. All medical center 
charges for each patient during the study period were summed, 
and intervention and control group means were calculated. For 
advance care planning, utilization, and charge data, we used 
the t test statistic to compare group means. A cutoff of P(cid:3).05 
determined statistical significance. From the exit interviews, 
we tabulated the discrete responses. 

A power calculation based on baseline pain scores among all 
study participants indicated a greater than 90% power ((cid:1)=.05) 
to detect a 10% change in average pain score on a 0- to 10- 
point scale for a sample size of 50 in each group. 


The medical center’s computerized medical record identifies 
all office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitaliza- 
tions. This electronic record lists medical problems and medi- 
cations prescribed, as entered in the written medical record by 
treating physicians. At study completion, a trained research as- 
sistant, masked to patients’ intervention versus control group 
assignment, reviewed the computerized medical records of all 
study subjects during the study period. Visits to the general medi- 
cine clinic, specialty clinics, urgent care clinic, and emergency 
department were tabulated. In addition, the numbers of hos- 
pitalizations and days hospitalized were calculated. Finally, we 
recorded the analgesic and antidepressant medications docu- 
mented on the computerized medication list at study entry or 
added during the study period. 
Although analysis of cost data is preferable, we were able 
only to acquire data on charges using the medical center’s com- 
The GMA and GMB physicians referred a similar num- 
ber of patients (164 and 166, respectively), and a simi- 
lar number of these patients met eligibility criteria (118 
in the GMA and 113 in the GMB). Fifty intervention pa- 
tients and 40 control patients were enrolled. Among eli- 
gible patients, 57.6% of referred intervention patients and 
64.6% of referred control patients refused to enroll in the 
study. Being too ill was the most frequently given expla- 
nation for refusal to participate by patients in both groups. 
The mean age of study participants (N=90) was 68.6 
years. Most were women (64%), white (53%), US citi- 
zens (69%), living with someone (57%), unmarried (73%), 
and retired (62%). Mean education level was 13.5 years 
(Table 1). Patients in the control (n=40) and interven-

tion (n=50) groups were similar with regard to all of these 
sociodemographic characteristics, except that there were 
more women in the intervention group (P=.05). There 
was no significant group difference (P =.15) in baseline 
mean functional status on the Rapid Disability Rating Scale 
(27.5 [SD, 6.2] for the intervention group; 25.1 [SD, 7.8] 
for the control group). Mean baseline forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second for patients with COPD was 1.29 (SD, 
0.32), and the mean baseline ejection fraction for those 
with CHF was 46.9% (SD, 13.0), with no significant dif- 
ference between groups (P=.85 and P=.40, respectively). 
Fifteen intervention patients (30%) and 9 controls 
(23%) did not complete the intervention, including 10 in- 
tervention patients (20%) and 5 controls (13%) who died 
(Table 1). There were no significant group differences be- 
tween the number of patients who died (P=.63) or who 
failed to complete the study for any other reason (loss of 
cognitive capacity, loss to follow-up, or refusal to participate). 
Only a single intervention patient refused to continue to

participate, owing to a move outside the region. Patients 
who died and those who did not complete the study for 
other reasons did not differ significantly from patients who 
completed the study with regard to age (P=.80 and P=.34, 
respectively), sex (P(cid:4).99 and P=.71, respectively), or un- 
derlying disease (P=.17 and P=.59, respectively). 

There were no significant baseline group differences in 
physical symptoms, psychological well-being, spiritual 
well-being, satisfaction, or advance care planning mea- 
sures (Table 2). 

Among intervention patients who completed the study, 
24 patients (69%) would have liked to receive CCT ser- 
vices earlier in the course of their illness. No patient re- 
ported a wish to defer receiving CCT services until later 
in their illness. 
In addition to the 3 formal assessments, the social 
worker provided each intervention patient an average of 
3.8 in-person and 13.0 telephone contacts during the year. 
The social worker contacted each patient’s PCP an av- 
erage of 1.6 times and contacted each patient’s family care- 
givers an average of 2.8 times. As a result of CCT case 
management, 37 patients (74%) received new durable 
medical equipment or social services to which they were 
entitled through existing public or commercial pro-

Of the 10 hospitalizations of CCT patients, the CCT 
was aware of 9. Hospitalized patients received at least 1 
hospital visit from a team member, with a mean number 
of visits of 2.2 per patient. In all cases, the CCT pro- 
vided information to the inpatient physicians about clini- 
cal issues or previous advance care planning decisions. 
Family members of 16 (62%) of the 26 intervention 
patients with identified family caregivers attended at least 
1 caregiver training session. Participating family mem- 
bers received an average of 3.6 contacts with the CCT fam- 
ily support nurse. The CCT chaplain contacted all inter- 
vention patients at least once. Twenty-one patients (42%) 
requested and received additional formal consultations with 
the chaplain or other religious advisors. All 50 interven- 
tion patients received at least 1 medication chart review 
by the CCT pharmacist. Forty-one patients (82%) re- 
ceived additional pharmacist consultation or education ser- 
vices in clinic or at home. Seventeen intervention pa- 
tients (34%) attended at least 1 support group or art 
experiential session, and family members of 4 patients (8%) 
also participated in the art experiential sessions. Forty- 
three intervention patients (86%) received the services of 
a pair of volunteer medical or pharmacy student patient 
advocates. No volunteer was available for 7 patients. On 
average, advocates made 6.5 contacts per patient, includ- 
ing telephone calls, home visits, and hospital visits. 


After controlling for the presence of dyspnea at base- 
line, the odds of a patient reporting any dyspnea at time 
3 were significantly less for the intervention group (odds 
ratio, 6.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-35.56). Inter- 
vention patients reported significantly less dyspnea in- 
terfering with daily activities (F=7.06; P=.01) (Table 3). 
There was a significant group(cid:2)time interaction with de- 
creased limitation of activity due to dyspnea for the in- 
tervention patients but increased limitation over time for 
control patients (F =6.83; P=.01). 
After controlling for pain at baseline, there were no 
statistically significant differences between groups or 
group(cid:2)time interactions for any of the pain items (Table 
3). The CCT made opioid and nonopioid pain manage- 
ment recommendations to PCPs in 23 cases (46%). How- 
ever, in 21 of these cases (91%), no documentation that 
the PCP followed the recommendation could be found 
in the computerized medical record. The PCPs initiated 
a recommended opioid for only 1 (8%) of 13 patients. 
Although the electronic record generally does not docu- 
ment physician recommendations that are refused by pa- 
tients, nonadherence with opioid recommendations was 
rare (reported by only 1 [8%] of 12 patients to whom opi- 
oids were newly prescribed). 
After controlling for baseline differences, there was 
a statistically significant improvement in sleep quality in 
the intervention group (F=4.05; P=.05) (Table 3). No 
statistically significant differences in sleep quantity or 
group(cid:2) time interactions emerged. 

After controlling for anxiety at baseline, there was no sta- 
tistically significant group difference in mean anxiety 
(P=.68) (Table 4). However, anxiety scores for the in- 
tervention patients improved from times 2 to 3 (mean 
scores, 6.8 to 5.3), whereas those for the control patients 
worsened (mean scores, 5.5 to 5.9). This group(cid:2)time in- 
teraction was statistically significant (P=.05). 
After controlling for baseline depression scores, there 
were no significant differences between groups or sig-

nificant group(cid:2)time interactions (Table 4). For the 23 
intervention patients with Center for Epidemiological 
Studies Depression Scale scores of at least 16 (46%), the 
CCT recommended antidepressant prescriptions (18 pa- 
tients) or an increase in the dosage of a current antide- 
pressant prescription (5 patients). The computerized 
medical record documented that an antidepressant was 
newly prescribed during the study period for only 3 (17%) 
of the 18 patients. Two patients with high Center for Epi- 
demiological Studies Depression Scale scores refused to 
consider treatment with antidepressants; however, only 
2 (11%) of 18 intervention patients with existing pre- 
scriptions reported nonadherence. 
After controlling for baseline spiritual well-being, 
intervention group patients reported higher overall spiri- 
tual well-being than controls (F=8.21; P=.007) (Table 
4). From times 2 to 3, the intervention group reported 
improved spiritual well-being (mean scores, 98.0 to 
105.5), whereas the control group was unchanged 
(mean scores, 91.2 to 92.4). This group(cid:2)time interac- 
tion was statistically significant (F = 4.24; P = .05). 
Patients in the intervention group also scored higher on 
the religious subscale (F = 14.01; P = .001). However, 
there were no group differences in scores or any signifi- 
cant group (cid:2) time interactions on the existential sub- 
scale. 
After controlling for baseline values, there were no 
significant quality-of-life score differences over time be- 
tween groups and no statistically significant group(cid:2)time 
interactions (Table 4). 
After controlling for baseline values, there were no 
significant group differences or group (cid:2) time interac- 
tions in health care satisfaction scores (Table 4). How- 
ever, during exit interviews, intervention patients re- 
ported that the CCT improved their level of connection 
and satisfaction with family (30 respondents [86%]), PCPs 
(28 respondents [80%]), and the medical center (23 re- 
spondents [66%]). 

For the 22 intervention patients and 18 controls who had 
not already completed a durable power of attorney for 
health care at baseline, 12 intervention patients (55%) 
and 5 controls (28%) had completed one by time 3 
(P=.12). For the 23 intervention patients and 19 con- 
trols who had not completed funeral arrangements at base- 
line, 8 intervention patients (35%) and 1 control (5%) 
had completed their arrangements by time 3, a statisti- 
cally significant difference (P=.03). For the 20 interven- 
tion patients and 11 controls who had not completed plans 
for disposition of their possessions at baseline, 16 inter- 
vention patients (80%) and 5 controls (46%) had made 
plans by time 3 (P=.11). In exit interviews, 23 interven- 
tion patients (66%) expressed appreciation for the op- 
portunity to discuss these and other elements of ad- 
vance care planning with the CCT. 

On average during the study period, intervention pa- 
tients made fewer visits to their PCP (mean, 7.5 vs 10.6; 
P=.03) and fewer urgent care clinic visits (mean, 0.3 vs 
0.6; P=.03) (Table 5). There were no statistically sig- 
nificant group differences with regard to specialty clinic 
visits (mean, 4.9 vs 7.0; P=.25), emergency department 
visits (mean, 1.6 vs 1.7; P=.81), number of hospitaliza- 
tions (mean, 1.2 vs 0.8; P=.21), or number of days hos- 
pitalized (mean, 6.3 vs 4.3; P=.38). 
Among the 10 intervention patients who died dur- 
ing the study period, 5 died at home or in a nursing home, 
2 died in the hospital, and 3 died in hospice care (home,

hospital, or institutional). Among the 5 control patients 
who died, 2 died at home or in a nursing home and 3 
died in hospice care. There were no significant group dif- 
ferences with regard to location of death (P=.40). 
The mean charge per patient for all medical center 
services during the study period was $47 211 (SD, 
$73 009) for intervention patients and $43 338 (SD, 
$69647) for controls (Table 5). This difference was not 
statistically significant (P=.80). There were no signifi- 
cant group differences in urgent care, emergency depart- 
ment, or inpatient charges. 

Our findings corroborate that patients with cancer, 
advanced CHF, or advanced COPD suffer significant 
symptoms as they near the end of life.11,12,46 The CCT 
improved some, although not all, of the outcomes we 
examined. We found improvements in the physical 
(dyspnea and sleep), psychological (anxiety), spiritual 
(spiritual well-being), and advance care planning (fu- 
neral planning) domains. In addition, patients with 
access to CCT services made fewer primary care and 
urgent care visits, without an associated increase in spe- 
cialty clinic visits, emergency department visits, number 
of hospitalizations, or number of days hospitalized. 
There were no significant group differences in medical 
center charges. 
Study results indicate that CCT patients did not have 
improvements in pain, depression, or quality of life. A 
likely and unfortunate explanation for this finding is that 
the CCT’s pain and depression recommendations were 
rarely implemented. Without appropriate treatment to 
relieve pain and depression, improving quality of life may 
be impossible.47,48 Our research methods could not de- 
tect instances in which PCPs may have made medica- 
tion recommendations that were refused by patients. How- 
ever, exit interviews with intervention patients revealed 
that only 2 refused antidepressant medication and none 
refused pain medications. These findings suggest that 
PCPs ignored important advice and are consistent with 
previous studies documenting PCP reluctance to treat pain 
and depression as a barrier to good care.11,46,49-53 It is also 
possible that PCPs did not follow CCT recommenda- 
tions because patients underwent assessment by a social 
worker with physician review, rather than direct exami- 
nation by a physician. However, the CCT consultation 
letter to PCPs was written and signed by a physician. 
Overall, the CCT was most effective in improving 
outcomes that the team could influence directly, via pro- 
vision of services, education, and support. Although 
supplemental oxygen therapy was frequently recom- 
mended, even dyspnea may have improved because of 
CCT attention to patients’ anxiety and fear about short- 
ness of breath.54,55 The CCT had little effect on out- 
comes that required action by PCPs, reflecting a limita- 
tion of consultation services in general.1,56 Outpatient 
palliative medicine teams might have greater efficacy if 
they are able to directly implement recommendations 
within clearly defined limits agreed to by the PCP. 
There was no significant difference in mortality or 
location of death between the groups, or any evidence 
that intervention patients enrolled in hospice care more 
frequently. In general, these outpatients with advanced 
illness received palliation of symptoms while pursuing 
aggressive treatment of their disease. 
Our findings have several limitations. First, partici- 
pants were not individually randomized. However, nearly 
all baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were similar. 
Rather than randomize patients within a single practice, 
2 similar but separate subpopulations of patients and phy- 
sicians were randomly assigned to the intervention and 
control arms (ie, those in 2 discrete practice modules). 
We chose this design to eliminate the contamination that 
would have occurred if physicians had cared for both in- 
tervention and control patients. Because physicians of pa- 
tients in the intervention group did not simultaneously 
care for control patients, we decreased the risk for con-

tamination whereby control group patients might indi- 
rectly receive the influence of CCT consultations and phy- 
sician education. 
Second, although well matched at baseline along 
most sociodemographic, functional, disease severity, and 
outcome measurements, the intervention group had more 
women. It is not clear, however, that improvement in dys- 
pnea, anxiety, or spiritual well-being is more likely in 
women than men, so this difference is unlikely to con- 
found our results, particularly since we controlled for base- 
line outcome values. 
Third, exit interviews may have been limited by ac- 
quiescence bias. Patients may have inflated positive feed- 
back about the CCT because of their relationship with 
the interviewing social worker. However, the fact that only 
some outcomes were improved argues against more than 
a minor contribution of this bias to our results. In addi- 
tion, exit interviews were conducted only with patients 
completing the intervention. It is possible that patients 
who failed to complete the study might have felt differ- 
ently about their CCT experience. However, available in- 
formation suggests that those who did not complete the 
study were similar to those who did. 
Fourth, the sample studied here was small, allow- 
ing for the possibility of type II errors. However, our a 
priori power calculation showed that our sample size was 
sufficient to detect a clinically meaningful difference in 
pain scores. In addition, despite statistically significant 
differences in survey scores, some findings (such as sleep 
quality differences) may not be clinically meaningful or 
have only a small effect size. However, in the cases of anxi- 
ety and dyspnea, not only were the differences clinically 
meaningful, but the intervention group improved while 
the control group worsened. We also consider the spiri- 
tual well-being and advance care planning differences ob- 
served to be clinically significant. 
Fifth, our study collected basic charge data only and 
did not include a formal cost-benefit analysis. De- 
creased primary care and urgent care visits were not ac- 
companied by increased utilization of other medical cen- 
ter services, but this decrease in clinic visits was not large 
enough to result in a statistically significant difference 
in overall charges between groups. Data on medication, 
out-of-pocket, and outside hospitalization charges were 
not collected; however, little care was received outside 
the medical center by these patients. Precise interven- 
tion costs were impossible to extract for a formal cost- 
benefit analysis, as research and clinical intervention costs 
were enmeshed in this study. However, we estimate the 
cost of the intervention to be modest, consisting primar- 
ily of part-time social worker effort.24 Now that we have 
some evidence of intervention efficacy, future research 
should assess the real costs of the intervention. Such an 
assessment would need to include careful accounting of 
the costs of all personnel time and activities (including 
patient care, chart review, team meeting, PCP commu- 
nication, and administrative time), medications, inter- 
vention administration, medical equipment and sup- 
plies, and patient out-of-pocket expenses. 
Finally, even for the benefits shown, the results may 
not be generalizable to patients with diseases other than 
CHF, COPD, or cancer, or to patients in different clini- 
cal settings, although our patients seem typical of those 
with chronic medical conditions. Also, because of the rela- 
tively large number of eligible patients refusing to en- 
roll, the results may not apply to the population of pa- 
tients with these diseases who are unable to participate 
or uninterested in participating in such an intervention. 
However, the study refusal rate was similar in the inter- 
vention and control groups, and both groups offered simi- 
lar reasons for refusing to participate. 
Nonetheless, our results justify a larger, random- 
ized controlled trial, including methods to increase PCP 
adherence to recommendations, or perhaps a comanage- 
ment model in which the CCT physicians can prescribe 
medications for patients, as is the case for other subspe- 
cialty consultations. Future studies should determine (1) 
which specific elements of the service actually led to the 
identified improvements, (2) the cost-effectiveness of such 
interventions, and (3) whether even earlier palliative medi- 
cine intervention would offer similar benefits. 
The CCT trial demonstrated that a palliative medi- 
cine consultation service for outpatients can improve pa- 
tient outcomes in the domains where it has a direct im- 
pact on patient care. Greater benefits could be achieved 
if consultants assumed earlier and more direct manage- 
ment of palliative care issues, including prescribing ap- 
propriate medications. Ultimately, we must attend to the 
needs of our aging population in which an increasing 
number of people are living fully even as they near the 
end of life. Patients with advanced chronic illness clearly 
desire palliative care, even as they pursue treatment of 
disease. However, since one fifth of the study patients died 
during the intervention year, physicians may have less 
time than they think to provide it.
