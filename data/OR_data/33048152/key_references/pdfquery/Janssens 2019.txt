Abstract 
Background: Despite their poor prognosis, patients with se- 
vere chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have lit- 
tle access to palliative care and tend to have a high rate of 
hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions during their 
last year of life. Objectives: To determine the feasibility of a 
home palliative care intervention during 1 year versus usual 
care, and the possible impact of this intervention on emer- 
gency, hospital and ICU admissions, survival, mood, and 
health-related quality of life (HRQL). Methods: Prospective 
controlled study of patients with severe COPD (GOLD stage 
III or IV) and long-term oxygen therapy and/or home nonin- 
vasive ventilation and/or one or more hospital admissions in 
the previous year for acute exacerbation, randomized to 
usual care versus usual care with add-on monthly interven- 
tion by palliative care specialists at home for 12 months. Re- 
sults: Of 315 patients screened, 49 (15.5%) were randomized 
(26 to early palliative care; 23 to the control group); aged 
(mean ± SD) 71 ± 8 years; FEV1 was 37 ± 14% predicted; 88% 
with a COPD assessment test score > 10; 69% on long-term 
oxygen therapy or home noninvasive ventilation. The pa- 
tients accepted the intervention and completed the assess- 
ment scales. After 1 year, there was no difference between 
groups in symptoms, HRQL and mood, and there was a non- 
significant trend for higher admission rates to hospital and 
emergency wards in the intervention group. Conclusion: Al- 
though this pilot study was underpowered to formally ex-

clude a benefit from palliative care in severe COPD, it raises 
several questions as to patient selection, reluctance to pal- 
liative care in this group, and modalities of future trials. 


Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a 
progressive lung disorder leading to chronic respiratory 
failure, respiratory distress, and recurrent hospitaliza- 
tions for acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Mortality rates 
of 30–50% have been reported within 2 years following 
hospital admission for acute exacerbations [1–4]. An es- 
timated 30% of COPD patients hospitalized for the first 
time are re-admitted within 3 months. While medical 
treatment may partially relieve symptoms and noninva- 
sive ventilation (NIV) and oxygen therapy may prolong 
life [5], for patients with severe COPD, both quality of life 
and survival are poor [6–8]. In spite of this, COPD pa- 
tients are much less likely to receive palliative care than 
patients with lung cancer [9–14]. In fact, COPD patients 
have limited access to specialists in palliative care [15, 16] 
and very few palliative care intervention studies are avail- 
able for this population [17, 18]. 
The “SUPPORT” study demonstrated that COPD pa- 
tients, when compared to patients with lung cancer, were 
much more likely to die in the intensive care unit (ICU), 
on mechanical ventilation and with dyspnea [19, 20]. 
These differences occurred although most patients with 
COPD preferred treatment focused on comfort rather 
than on prolonging life. In fact, “SUPPORT” found that 
patients with lung cancer and COPD were equally likely 
to prefer not being intubated, and not receiving cardio- 
pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), yet patients with COPD 
were much more likely to receive these therapies. 
Because of these observations, advance care planning 
(ACP) should be especially appropriate among patients 
with COPD: their unpredictable trajectory of illness and 
exacerbations may make these patients suddenly critical- 
ly ill. However, only a minority of patients with moder- 
ate-to-severe COPD have discussed treatment preferenc- 
es and end-of-life care issues with their physicians [21, 
22]. In fact, most COPD patients believe that their physi- 
cians do not know their preferences for end-of-life care. 
Severe COPD also represents a substantial and prolonged 
burden in terms of care, with often a poor control of 
symptoms and emotional disorders. 
The aim of this pilot prospective randomized study 
was to evaluate the feasibility and possible impact of an 
early palliative care intervention at home in severe and 
very severe COPD patients over a 1-year period. Because 
admissions to emergency wards, hospitalizations and ad- 
missions to ICUs are distressing experiences for these pa- 
tients, and represent a substantial financial burden, we 
defined these items as major endpoints of our interven- 
tion. We added a detailed evaluation of symptoms, health- 
related quality of life (HRQL), and mood disturbances as 
secondary endpoints. Our hypotheses were that patients 
would accept and benefit from a palliative care interven- 
tion and that, through improved understanding of their 
disease and symptom management, and promotion of 
ACP, requirements for in-hospital acute care would de- 
crease. 

Patients were recruited among subjects followed by Geneva 
University Hospitals on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and/or 
home NIV, and subjects hospitalized for AECOPD in our general 
internal medicine and geriatric wards. 
Details of the study protocol have previously been published 
[23]. Briefly, inclusion criteria were: COPD defined according to 
GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Diseases; www. 
goldcopd.org) criteria (FEV1/FVC < 70%) stage III or IV (FEV1 
< 50% predicted) and LTOT and/or home NIV and/or one or more 
hospital admissions in the previous year for an acute exacerbation. 
Exclusion criteria were: moderate or severe cognitive impairment 
(Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score < 23) and cancer. 
After providing written informed consent and filling in base- 
line measurements, patients were randomly assigned to the early 
palliative care group (EPC) or the standard care group (SC) in a 
1: 1 ratio without stratification and with randomized block sizes 
ranging from 4 to 6, using sealed envelopes prepared with a com- 
puter program by F.R.H., a co-investigator not involved in the in- 
clusion of the patients. 
Intervention 
Patients assigned to the EPC group met our community ambu- 
latory palliative care team as soon as possible after inclusion and 
monthly thereafter for 12 months. Home visits by nurses from the 
palliative care consultation lasted approximately 90 min and fo- 
cused on: 
 − Symptom assessment and management using the Edmonton 
Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) [22, 23]. If intensity of 
pain, dyspnea, mood, anxiety, and appetite were > 4/10 and the 
patient agreed, a consultation with a palliative care physician 
(or other specialist) was suggested 
 − Nutrition (Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale) [24] 
 − Understanding of illness and coping: information about COPD 
was provided through patient education, and use of brochures 
on activities of daily living [25]; management of acute and 
chronic dyspnea were discussed as well as use of morphine 
 − Anticipation, decision-making: completion of ACP was system- 











 − Coordination between different health providers 
 − Alternative approaches such as relaxation, reflexology, mas- 
sages 
All cases were discussed with a physician specialized in pallia- 
tive care, whom the patient could consult whenever appropriate. 
The palliative care team could be reached between visits if request- 
ed. 
Control Group 
Patients randomized to the SC group had no contact with the 
palliative care team. Both groups received standard care through- 
out the study period. For all patients under LTOT and/or home 
NIV, specialized nurses provided regular home visits to check on 
all aspects related to respiratory support. Treatments prescribed by 
a primary care physician or pulmonologist (chest therapy, physio- 
therapy, other aspects of home care) were not modified. Health 
care workers following the control group were not informed of the 
content of the “palliative care” intervention. Because the palliative 
care team was distinct from those providing standard care, the risk 
of “contamination” of the control group by the early palliative care 
intervention was minimal. 
For both groups, a research nurse (independent from the pal- 
liative care team) performed a standardized evaluation including: 
 − At inclusion: basic sociodemographic data, MMSE, spirome- 
try, use of oxygen or NIV, history of recent exacerbations (< 3 
months), prior admissions to the emergency ward, hospital, 
ICU, medication, network of health care workers and informal 
support (family), ACP 
 − Every month: data related to primary outcomes (hospital, 
emergency ward and ICU admissions) recorded through hos- 
pital files, contact with the patient and his/her GP 
 − Every 3 months: data related to primary outcomes; COPD as- 
sessment test (CAT) [26]; Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
scale (HAD) [27]; SF-36 HRQL scale [28] 
This agenda was followed for 12 months. A final questionnaire 
(focused on satisfaction with and acceptability of the intervention) 
was submitted to all patients 6 months after the end of the inter- 
vention. 
All data were anonymized and recorded on Secutrial software, 
and, at the end of data collection, transferred to our statistician 
(F.R.H.) for analysis. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
(NCT02223780).

Statistical Analysis 
Group comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney 
U test, Student’s t test, the Fisher exact or χ2 tests, as appropriate. 
Survival data and a composite variable (i.e., any admission to hos- 
pital for cardiac or respiratory causes or death) were compared 
between groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. 
Scores which were filled in repeatedly (HAD, SF-36 scores and 
subscores) were analyzed using mixed linear regression with visit, 
group and visit × group interaction as predictors, while taking into 
account the exact date of the visit. Number of hospitalizations and 
admissions were analyzed using incidence rate ratios computed 
with Stata’s “iri” command. The Benjamini and Hochberg correc- 
tion for multiple testing was applied for Table 3. 



Among 315 patients screened over an 18-month pe- 
riod, 137 (43%) refused to participate; 28 patients (9%) 
did not fulfill MMSE inclusion criteria (MMSE score 
> 23); 63 (20%) had either cancer or another comorbidity 
limiting their short-term prognosis; 11 (3.4%) were in- 

cluded in another protocol; and 6 died rapidly during the 
inclusion process (Fig. 1, flowchart). None of the patients 
from the geriatric ward (n = 45) fulfilled MMSE inclusion 
criteria. Fifty-one patients were finally included. Of these, 
1 (EPC group) died before the first home visit by the pal- 
liative care nurse. Another patient declined pursuing the 
study just after randomization when he learned that he 
was allocated to the control group. Thus, 49 patients were 
analyzed (26 in the EPC group and 23 in the SC group); 
36 (73%) had been hospitalized during the previous year; 
all were GOLD stage III or IV, group D. Eight (16%) pa- 
tients had died at the end of the study (1 in the ICU, 2 at 
home, and 5 in hospital wards). 
Sociodemographic and functional data at inclusion are 
summarized in Tables 1 and 2, and in the online supple- 
ment (see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000495312 for 
all online suppl. material). For all items provided, the ran- 
domization process performed well, and there were no 
significant differences between groups for sociodemo- 
graphic, anthropometric, functional and subjective vari- 
ables. This was also the case for hospital, emergency ward 
and ICU admissions during the year prior to inclusion

(Table 3). Pulmonary function tests confirm the severe/ 
very severe obstructive syndrome related to COPD 
(GOLD stage III or IV, group D criteria). Approximately 
70% of all patients were either on LTOT, home NIV, or 
both; 73.5% had been hospitalized within the year prior 
to inclusion in our study for AECOPD. One third of pa- 
tients were on antidepressant or anxiolytic medication, 
and 16% were on opiates. 
Admissions to Emergency Wards, ICU, and 
Hospitalizations 
As shown in Table 3, patients in the EPC group were 
hospitalized for respiratory failure (IRR 1.87, 95% CI 
1.04–3.48, p = 0.026) and admitted to the emergency ward 
(IRR 2.05, 95% CI 1.11–3.94, p = 0.014) twice as often 
during follow-up than the control group. However, after 
the Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple test- 
ing, none of these differences was significant. Further- 
more, when the same data are expressed as number of 
events by patient, median values are identical in both 
groups (hospitalization: median [IQR]: 0.0 [1; 2] vs. 1.5 
[1; 4], p = 0.219; admissions to emergency wards: 1–0 [0; 
3] vs. 1.0 [0; 4], p = 0.484). Figure 2 shows a Kaplan-Mei- 
er curve for a composite variable (admission to hospital 
or death) for both groups. The log-rank test did not show 
any significant difference between groups. 
The use of antibiotics (for exacerbations not leading to 
hospital admission) did not differ between groups during 
the observation period (p = 0.819). 
Health-Related Quality of Life (SF-36) 
Average values at inclusion are provided in Table 2; 
online supplementary Figures 3S–10S show longitudinal 
follow-up of all subscores of the SF-36. Each figure shows 
expected values for a normal Swiss population matched 
for age and gender [29]. None of the items differed sig- 
nificantly between groups at inclusion or during follow- 
up. The most severely affected scores at inclusion were

clusion, 26.5% had abnormal values for anxiety and 26.5% 
had borderline values. Scores for depression were abnor- 
mal in 16.3% and borderline in 12.2%. There was no sig- 
nificant difference between groups at inclusion, and val- 
ues remained stable without any difference between 
groups during longitudinal follow-up (Table 2, online 
suppl. Fig. 1S and 2S). 
COPD Assessment Test 
Average values were very high for both groups at in- 
clusion (Table 2) reflecting severe impairment without 
any difference between groups at T0 or during follow-up. 
Globally, 88% had a CAT value > 10. 
Symptom Scores: Edmonton Symptom Assessment 
Scale 
ESAS scores were performed only in the EPC group 
[30], being considered as inherent to the palliative symp- 
tom assessment. Values at T0 are provided in Table 4. 
Online supplementary Figure 11S shows individual items 
at inclusion and during follow-up. Highest values (i.e., 
worse) were recorded for the items “breathlessness,” “fa- 
tigue,” and “well-being.” Symptom scores above 4 were 
recorded in 37.6% (67 of 178) of home visits but led to a 
specific medical intervention in 12 occurrences only 
(most suggestions of medical intervention being refused 
by patients). 
Advance Care Planning 
At inclusion, 3 patients in each group had completed 
their ACP directives (p = 1.000). At the end of the study, 
9 patients (35%) of the EPC group versus 3 (13%) of the 
control group had completed ACP directives (p = 0.194).

“vitality,” “general health,” “physical functioning,” “role

improvement during the first 2 home visits, score values 
remained stable during follow-up.

Values are on a scale from 0 to 10. A threshold of 4 was used to 
propose a medical intervention by a specialist in palliative care, a 
primary care physician or a specialist. 
There was therefore a significant difference in the num- 
ber of patients who wrote their ACP directives in favor of 
the EPC group (p = 0.023). 
Survival 
During the follow-up (454 days [1.24 years; 95% CI: 
382–525] in the EPC group vs. 425 days [1.16 years; 95% 
CI: 339–509] in the SC group; p = 0.592), 8 deaths oc- 
curred, 4 in each group. Survival did not differ between 
groups (log-rank test, p = 0.913). 
Appreciation of Intervention Questionnaire 
Six months after the end of the intervention, patients 
of the EPC group were asked if they had appreciated the 
home visits of the specialized nurse (18 responses, 17 ap- 
proved), and whether the monthly visits of the specialized 
nurse had impacted on their quality of life (9, i.e. 50% ap- 
proved, 6 did not know, 3 disagreed). 

To our knowledge, this pilot study is the first prospec- 
tive randomized study of an early palliative care interven- 
tion at home, over a 1-year period, in severe COPD pa- 
tients, most of whom were on LTOT, home NIV, or both. 
Patients were very symptomatic, with high CAT scores, 
markedly impaired HRQL (SF-36), and high levels of 
anxiety and depression. Palliative intervention was based 
on monthly interventions at home with a holistic ap- 
proach. The study showed that recruitment in the tar- 
geted population was a major problem. As a result of this, 
data presented are underpowered to exclude any effect of 
the palliative care intervention. The intervention was fea- 
sible, as well as the evaluations performed of the use of 
health resources, HRQL, and emotional disorders. Data 
show a trend for a higher rate of hospital and ICU admis- 
sions for respiratory causes in the intervention group, 
which loses statistical significance when expressed as 
number of events per patient. Mood, HRQL, and CAT 
scores did not differ significantly between groups initial- 
ly or during follow-up. However, more patients complet- 
ed ACP directives in the intervention group. 
Defining “early” intervention for palliative care is ar- 
bitrary [31]. We chose patients with LTOT and/or NIV 
and or hospitalized within the preceding year. Patients 
hospitalized for AECOPD are at high risk of subsequent 
readmission or post-discharge mortality; those under 
LTOT and/or home NIV also have a limited survival, jus- 
tifying the chosen criteria. Other items such as FEV1 
< 30% predicted, oxygen dependence, AECOPD in the 
previous year, comorbidities, decreased functional status 
are also helpful to identify high-risk subjects and should 
trigger discussions on ACP and end-of-life care [31]. 
However, the interindividual variability of the clinical 
course of COPD is a problem: even indices such as the 
BODE or ADO are poor predictors of mortality for a giv- 
en individual [32, 33]. Tools such as the ProPal-COPD 
require further validation but seem promising for select- 
ing patients at high risk of 1-year mortality [34]. 
Recruiting patients for this study proved to be very dif- 
ficult: although screening was prolonged, extended to an- 
other hospital and to all pulmonary physicians in our 
area, we did not reach the target number of cases and only 
15% of the targeted population was finally included. Sev- 
eral factors explain these difficulties. First, we realized 
that palliative care was perceived as frightening for many 
patients and negatively associated with end-of-life care. 
Although the study was presented as focusing on improv- 
ing symptom control, we were transparent as to the nurs- 
es’ training, and did not dissimulate their identity as pal- 
liative care specialists. There is clearly a negative connota- 
tion to “palliative care,” which had an unfavorable impact 
on study acceptance, despite the detailed explanations 
provided. To avoid this, integrating palliative care into 
usual care and developing a palliative care culture and 
competence among the respiratory care team is an inter- 
esting option. Secondly, cognitive impairment was a 
problem: none of the patients from the geriatric ward 
could be included because of their low MMSE scores; a 
nonquantified number of subjects with probable cogni- 




tive limitation were not included in the screening process; 
in those formally screened, close to 10% had an MMSE 
score < 23. Excluding subjects with cognitive disorders 
was mandatory for the reliability of questionnaires and 
symptom scores included in the study protocol. Cogni- 
tive impairment is an underestimated and important 
problem in this group of patients: a recent study showed 
that less than 50% of severe COPD patients discussing 
end-of-life options retained full comprehension of the 
options after 24 h [35]. Several other groups have docu- 
mented cognitive impairment in COPD under LTOT 
[36–41]. Thirdly, comorbidities (cancer, severe cardiac 
failure), and end-of-life were also limiting factors for in- 
clusion. Finally, there was a high reluctance to participate 
in our study based on concepts such as “fear of being a 
guinea pig,” “uselessness of the study for their care,” or 
refusal of randomization, even in patients followed by our 
team. Further studies on this topic must anticipate these 
difficulties. 
The expected impact of the ECP group on hospital, 
ICU and emergency ward admissions was not confirmed. 
In fact, despite a similar rate of hospital admissions in 
both groups during the year preceding this trial, there 
were more admissions to both ICU and the emergency 
wards in the ECP group during the observation period. 
This trend was not significant when results are expressed 
as number of events per patients. There is no obvious ex- 
planation for this finding. As mentioned, these findings 
must take into account the limited number of subjects. It 
shows, however, the need for quantifying the use of health 
resources in future larger studies on this topic. 
A positive finding was the increased number of ACP 
in the EPC group. One of the goals of the intervention was 
indeed to have patients understand the prognosis of their 
disorder and the possible futility of aggressive end-of-life 
managements. Very little data are available on ACP in 
COPD; and available data show that ACP is surprisingly 
uncommon in this population [42–45]. Paradoxically, 
ACP obtained most often expressed the desire of CPR and 
maximal treatment, patients failing to acknowledge their 
prognosis and the natural history of their disease [46]. 
In previous studies of advanced COPD, and symptom- 
based interventions, dyspnea has been a major focus [18]. 
Among medications prescribed for symptom control, in 
spite of its documented efficacy, we noted a high reluc- 
tance expressed by patients to use oral morphine: only 4 
patients in each group (16%) accepted opiates for im- 
proving control of dyspnea. Prescription of morphine did 
not increase during the study period in spite of repeated 
encouragement by the intervention group. Reluctance to 
use morphine by physicians and patients is well described 
in this setting [47]. 
Our results did not show any impact of early palliative 
care on mood disturbances or HRQL. These results must 
be put in perspective. (1) The number of subjects finally 
included was under the level established to avoid a type II 
error and thus the study was underpowered for a definite 
conclusion. However, detailed analysis of mood (HAD), 
HRQL (SF-36), and symptoms (CAT) (see online suppl. 
Fig. 1S–11S) shows a remarkable similarity of results be- 
tween both groups without the smallest trend favoring 
the intervention. (2) The tools used to evaluate secondary 
endpoints of the intervention may have been less respon- 
sive than disease-specific HRQL tools. We considered 
that adding a disease-specific HRQL questionnaire would 
be too time-consuming for study patients, who were al- 
ready burdened by a very thorough assessment. (3) Mo- 
dalities of the intervention could be questioned. Howev- 
er, the nurses implicated all had several years of experi- 
ence in palliative care. Their interventions were directly 
supervised by a palliative care physician, who discussed 
all cases with the specialized nurses and defined medical 
strategies whenever symptom scores were abnormal 
(ESAS items > 4). The intervention was comprehensive, 
including regular symptom assessment and control, pa- 
tient education, psychological support to patients and 
caregivers, and alternative approaches such as relaxation, 
reflexology, and massages. We therefore believe that the 
intervention was appropriately designed. (4) Modalities 
of usual care in these patients may have “diluted” the im- 
pact of the palliative care intervention: all patients under 
LTOT and/or NIV in our area receive regular home visits 
be specialized nurses; 37% of patients had home physio- 
therapy; 31% had home nurses for nonrespiratory treat- 
ments. One may therefore surmise that the implication of 
several different health care workers may have limited the 
benefit of the intervention. Indeed, among patients refus- 
ing to participate in the study, one of the reasons provid- 
ed was the fear of too many health care workers invading 
their privacy. (5) Finally, patient recruitment may have 
influenced our results: the 15.6% of subjects included, 
with a normal MMSE score, without significant comor- 
bidities, accepting the idea of a clinical study, may have a 
different resilience regarding their illness and may not 
require the type of support provided. 
Acknowledging these limitations, it is also possible 
that this type of intervention is not in phase with the ex- 
pectations of severe COPD patients. It is common knowl- 
edge that cancer has a poor prognosis, but prognosis of 
COPD is unclear for patients, and information provided 





by physicians is probably insufficient. Based on their un- 
derstanding of their illness, ACP limiting access to ICU 
or CPR for instance may not make sense for these pa- 
tients. Severe COPD often have unreasonable expecta- 
tions and tend to ignore or deny their prognosis. It is also 
possible that EPC must target specific subgroups of severe 
COPD: these patients have many different phenotypes 
with different impacts on symptoms. Larger studies are 
required to explore this possibility. 
In summary, in this pilot study of patients with severe 
COPD, most of whom were under LTOT and/or home 
NIV, quality of life was markedly impaired, with consid- 
erable mood disturbance, and functional limitation. Re- 
cruitment proved to be a major barrier, with several pos- 
sible explanations, many of which are related to the un- 
derlying pathology. A monthly home palliative care 
intervention by specialized nurses for 1 year, completing 
usual care, was feasible. The present study was underpow- 
ered to exclude a benefit from palliative care. Advance 
directives were provided more often in the intervention 
group. Because of the major impact of severe COPD on 
HRQL, and on the use of health resources, further studies 
are necessary and must be designed to take into account 
the recruitment problems encountered, the frequency of 
cognitive impairment and of comorbidities in this popu- 
lation, and possibly specific phenotypes for whom ECP 
should be privileged. 

This study was financed by the Swiss National Foundation for 
Research, within a program (PRN 67 grant, https://www.mysnf.

Geneva, both non-profit organizations devoted to supporting 
health care and research.
