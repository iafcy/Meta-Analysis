Swedish Register of Palliative Care between patients with heart 
disease and those with cancer.4 For example, patients with heart 
disease experience more shortness of breath and have fewer 
drugs prescribed on demand against the usual symptoms, com- 
pared with patients with cancer.4 In addition, patients with CHF 
often require frequent hospitalizations and readmissions, suggest- 
ing insufficient management of these patients, which may be due 
to the frequency of concomitant chronic diseases. The European 
that selected 
Society of Cardiology (ESC) has pointed out 

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a serious condition with a prognosis 
worse than many forms of cancer.1 Patients with CHF have symp- 
toms as severe and distressing as those of cancer patients, but they 
do not have equal access to palliative care.2 The course of CHF is 
unpredictable, making it difficult to identify a specific time point to 
introduce palliative care to heart failure management.3 Recently, 
we found large differences in the quality of end-of-life care in the

We evaluated the outcome of person-centred and integrated Palliative advanced home caRE and heart FailurE caRe 
(PREFER) with regard to patient symptoms, health-related quality of life (HQRL), and hospitalizations compared with 
usual care.

Methods 
From January 2011 to October 2012, 36 (26 males, 10 females, mean age 81.9 years) patients with chronic heart 
and results 
failure (NYHA class III–IV) were randomized to PREFER and 36 (25 males, 11 females, mean age 76.6 years) 
to the control group at a single centre. Prospective assessments were made at 1, 3, and 6 months using the 
Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, Euro Qol, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and rehospitalizations. 
Between-group analysis revealed that patients receiving PREFER had improved HRQL compared with controls 
(57.6 ± 19.2 vs. 48.5 ± 24.4, age-adjusted P-value = 0.05). Within-group analysis revealed a 26% improvement in the 
PREFER group for HRQL (P = 0.046) compared with 3% (P = 0.82) in the control group. Nausea was improved in the 
PREFER group (2.4 ± 2.7 vs. 1.7 ± 1.7, P = 0.02), and total symptom burden, self-efficacy, and quality of life improved 
by 18% (P = 0.035), 17% (P = 0.041), and 24% (P = 0.047), respectively. NYHA class improved in 11 of the 28 (39%) 
PREFER patients compared with 3 of the 29 (10%) control patients (P = 0.015). Fifteen rehospitalizations (103 days) 
occurred in the PREFER group, compared with 53 (305 days) in the control group.

Conclusion 
Person-centred care combined with active heart failure and palliative care at home has the potential to improve 
quality of life and morbidity substantially in patients with severe chronic heart failure.

Methods 
Study design and setting 
This was a prospective randomized study with an open non-blinded 
design. Patients were randomized with envelopes in blocks of 20 to 
the PREFER intervention group (n = 36) or to usual care (n = 36). 
Usual care was provided mainly by general practitioners or doctors 
and/or the nurse-led heart failure clinic at the Medicine-Geriatrics 
department. After 6 months (±2 weeks) the patients were trans- 
ferred to the original care provider following the establishment 
of an individual care plan. The research context was an advanced 
home care unit providing services Monday–Friday during the day 
and based in a county hospital located in northern Sweden. The 
home visits and the phone calls varied substantially from several 
times per day to every other week. Diuretic administration also 
varied substantially between patients due to the severity of heart 
failure, from none to several times per day. Diuretics were admin- 
istered s.c. or i.v. at home on demand for worsening symptoms 
when oral therapy was insufficient. Blood sampling, e.g. for deter- 
mination of electrolytes, creatinine, and BNP, and transmission of 
the ECG to the hospital, were performed in the patient’s home. 
No i.v. inotrope was administered at home.

patients require palliative care services in addition to the heart 
failure management programme.3 Guidelines5 have concluded that 
a great need exists for new models of integrated care, such as 
active heart failure and palliative care, in order to facilitate care 
equality for dying patients regardless of diagnosis. This idea is 
also in line with the World Health Organization’s description 
of palliative care.6 We found some information in the literature 
concerning the advantages and effects of an in-hospital specialist 
heart failure- and home-based palliative care for patients with 
severe CHF.7 A Cochrane review showed that home palliative care 
reduces symptom burden, particularly for patients with cancer, 
but more research is needed on valid outcomes in populations 
with non-malignant conditions and powered studies are required 
to compare different models of home palliative care.8 
Here, we report the clinical outcome of a new model that 
integrates Palliative advanced home caRE and heart FailurE caRe 
(PREFER) for patients with severe CHF (Figure 1) as described 
previously.9 Our hypothesis was that the combination of key 
components for delivering heart failure care and palliative care 
contained in PREFER should reduce the total symptom burden, 
increase health-related quality of life (HRQL) and functional capac- 
ity, and reduce morbidity. 
Our primary aim was to evaluate the effects of the PREFER inter- 
vention on symptom burden, quality of life (QoL), and functional 
classes compared with usual care. The secondary aim was to study 
the effect of the PREFER model on the number of hospitalizations 
and days spent in hospital. 








registry study.10 We identified 517 patients eligible for the study, 
of whom 72 were finally randomized (Figure 2). 
Randomization and intervention 
Patients (n = 72) were randomized into either the PREFER inter- 
vention (n = 36) or the control group (n = 36). Patients in the inter- 
vention group were offered a multidisciplinary approach involving 
collaboration between specialists in palliative and heart failure care, 
i.e. specialized nurses, palliative care nurses, cardiologist, pallia- 
tive care physician, physiotherapist, and occupational therapist. The 
patients were also offered structured, person-centred care (PCC) 
at home.11 PCC is one of the key components and cornerstones 
in the PREFER model. PCC is described as a partnership between 
patients/carers and professional caregivers, and includes initiating, 
working on, and documenting the partnership. The starting point 
is the patient’s narrative, which is recorded in a structured man- 
ner and from which a mutual care plan is created that incorporates 
goals and strategies for implementation and follow-up.11 
The intervention was carried out as follows: (i) after identifying 
a patient who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had no exclusion 
criteria earlier described in the design paper,12 a responsible physi- 
cian and nurse were identified for each patient; (ii) the patient was 
then called for a thorough medical examination by the responsible 
physician with identification of co-morbidities and assessment of 
physiological, social, and spiritual needs; followed by (iii) meeting 
inhabitants who had their primary healthcare centre within 30 km 
of the hospital. 
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF1 and cared for 
at the Department of Medicine-Geriatrics or primary healthcare 
centres and who met the criteria of the ESC5 were asked to 
participate in the study. Inclusion criteria comprised CHF with 
NYHA functional classes III − IV symptoms and at least one of 
the following: at least one hospitalized episode of worsening heart 
failure that resolved with the injection/infusion of diuretics or 
the addition of other heart failure treatment in the preceding 6 
months and regarded as being ‘optimally treated’ according to the 
responsible physician; need for frequent or continual i.v. support; 
chronically poor QoL based on a visual analogue scale (VAS) 
score <50; signs of cardiac cachexia, defined as an involuntary 
non-oedematous weight loss ≥6% of total body weight within the 
preceding 6–12 months; and life expectancy of <1 year. Exclusion 
criteria were patients who did not want to participate in the 
study; had severe communication problems; had severe dementia 
or other serious diseases in which heart failure was of secondary 
importance; with other life-threatening illnesses as their primary 
diagnosis and an expected short survival time; whose primary care 
centre responsible for their care was located >30 km from the 
hospital; and who were already participating in another clinical trial. 
We estimated a prevalence of CHF of 2% (1500), and ∼32% (480) 
of these would be in NYHA class III–IV according to a Swedish .

5-point scale EQ-5D 5 L:20 no problem, slight problems, moderate 
problems, severe problems, and impossible or extremely difficult 
problems. A VAS was also used.14 
The QoL was also measured using the disease-specific instru- 
ment, the KCCQ, which measures physical limitation, symptoms 
(frequency, severity, and recent change over time), QoL, social 
interference, and self-efficacy. The KCCQ is a valid and reliable 
instrument in a Swedish CHF population.16 Scores are transformed 
to a range of 0–100, in which higher scores reflect better health 
status. 

Patients with CHF (NYHA class III–IV) were considered to have 
a mean total symptom burden corresponding to 50 points out 
of 100 according to the ESAS scale and compared with findings 
by Follwell et al.17 for patients with cancer. The patients in that 
study had a mean ESAS Distress Score (EDS) of 39.5 at baseline, 
and a mean improvement in the EDS of 8.8 points. The PREFER 
model was created to improve the mean symptom burden by at 
least 25% compared with the control group. With a power of 80%, 
significance level of P < 0.05, and an estimated drop-out rate of 
15%, 31 patients were needed in each arm (total 62 patients). Due 
to patients dropping out, mainly due to deaths (12 patients), the 
number of participants was increased to 36 in each arm. 
Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) 
or frequencies expressed as percentages. Comparisons between 
the intervention and control groups were made using the 2 
test for proportions and Student’s t-test for normally distributed 
continuous variables. The Shapiro–Wilk statistic was used to test 
normality. If the distributions were not normal or ordinal, the 
Mann–Whitney U-test or 2 with Fisher’s exact test for categorical 
variables was used. For within-group analysis of non-normally 
distributed data, the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was 
used. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds 
ratio and 95% confidence interval 
for different variables after 
adjusting for age differences between the groups. All analyses 
were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A P-value <0.05 
was considered significant. The data were analysed using PASW 
Statistics 18. 
Ethics 
Oral and written informed consent was obtained from all 
participants. The investigation conforms to the principles out- 
lined in the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964. The Regional Ethics 
Committee for Human Research at Umeå University (reference 
number 2010-294-31 M) approved the study, which was registered 
at www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration number NCT01304381).

including 
co-morbidities. Assessments of symptoms, QoL, and risks of decu- 
bitus, falling, and malnutrition were continually performed in a 
structured way with validated questionnaires or in the national 
quality of care registry by the Swedish Association of Local Author- 
ities and Regions (SALAR). Further registrations in the national 
palliative registry and heart failure registry were performed. The 
Swedish Palliative Registry is a nationwide quality registry aimed 
at improving end-of-life care. The goal of the registry is to list and 
report quality indicators related to care during the last week of 
life in the case of all expected deaths in Sweden. This was fulfilled 
by each profession and documented independently, but also in the 
team in order to support the patient and attain the goals. The struc- 
ture of care was also based on goals and steps in the process of 
providing palliative care for patients with CHF as recommended by 
the ESC1,5,9 and developed within the PREFER model as described 
previously.12 
One of the researchers (M.B.) was not involved in the treatment 
and care of the patients; the other researcher (K.B.) shared respon- 
sibility for cardiac treatment together with a general practitioner 
specialized in palliative medicine. 
Assessments and outcomes 
Prospective assessments were made at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 
months of follow-up using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment 
Scale (ESAS), Euro Qol (EQ-5D), and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy 
Questionnaire (KCCQ). Socio-demographic and clinical character- 
istics were measured at baseline using a pre-specified protocol. If a 
categorical variable was denoted as unknown it was registered as 
a no answer. The questionnaires (Qs) were filled in by the patients 
themselves, baseline. At and the final 6 month Qs were filled in at 
the research unit. At the 1 and 3 month visits, Qs were filled in at 
home and returned in an envelope. The response rate was 100% 
at baseline and 1 month. At 2 months, four Qs were missing and 
at 6 months six Qs were missing (one due to dementia). 
The ESAS, a valid and reliable tool,13 was used to measure symp- 
tom burden: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsi- 
ness, appetite, well-being, and shortness of breath. The severity 
of each symptom at the time of assessment is rated on a 10-item 
numerical scale.13 The item ‘other’ was not included in the analysis 
due to very few answers. 
The HRQL was measured using EQ-5D, a generic, single index 
that defines health in the five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.14,15 For each 
dimension, the health of the patient is rated by the patient on a. 


shown) and 6 months. However, in the PREFER group, we noted 
an increase in 19 summary scores and a decrease in one. The 
increase was statistically significant for total symptom burden (18%, 
P = 0.035), self-efficacy (17%, P = 0.041), and QoL (24%, P = 0.047; 
Table 2). 
In the control group, we found no significant difference in 
any dimension (data not shown). Increases were observed in 11 
dimensions and decreases in 9. 
Functional classes 
Functional classes improved in the PREFER group compared with 
controls, including a significant difference in mean NYHA class at 
6 months (2.9 ± 0.65 vs. 3.3 ± 0.58, P = 0.012, baseline 3.2 vs. 3.1; 
Table 3). In the PREFER group, improvement was seen in 11 out 
of 28 (39%) vs. 3 out of 32 (9%) in the control group (P = 0.015). 
Worsening NYHA functional class was found in 2 out of 28 (7%) 
vs. 5 out of 32 (16%) patients in the PREFER and control groups, 
respectively. 
Hospitalizations 
The mean number of hospitalizations was significantly lower in 
the PREFER group than in the control group (0.42 ± 0.60 vs. 
1.47 ± 1.81, P = 0.009; Table 4). The total number of hospitaliza- 
tions was 15 in the PREFER group and 53 in the control group. The 
total number of days spent in hospital was 408, range 1–46 days, 
being 103 (range 1–45 days) in the PREFER group and 305 (range 
2–46 days) in the control group. The mean number of days was 
significantly (2.9 ± 8.3 vs. 8.5 ± 12.4, P = 0.011) lower in the PRE- 
FER group compared with the control group. The number of days 
spent in hospital was also significantly lower in the PREFER group 
at the Departments of Medicine-Geriatrics (100, range 1–45 vs. 
242, range 2–46 days) and Surgery (0 vs. 56, range 2–21 days) 
(Table 3). Days in other departments did not differ significantly (3, 
range 1–2 vs. 7, range 1–6 days). 


Resource utilization 
There were significant differences in the utilization of visits and 
phone calls or prescriptions of physicians and nurses between 
the PREFER and usual care group at the outpatient clinic of the 
hospitals and the primary healthcare centres (Table 4). Additionally, 
within the PREFER team there were 158 additional physician visits 
and 1031 nurse visits at the patient’s home, and 36 phone call 
and/or drug prescriptions by the physician and 225 phone calls 
and/or prescriptions by the nurses. Summarizing all this, the most 
striking difference was found between nurse visits in the PREFER 
group and the usual care group (1075 vs. 230; P = 0.000). On the 
other hand, phone calls and prescriptions by doctors were more 
common in the usual care group (108 vs. 231), while physician’s 
visits were somewhat similar (194 vs. 201). 
two groups were balanced with respect to baseline character- 
istics except for mean age (PREFER 81.9 ± 7.2 years vs. control 
76.6 ± 10.2 years, P = 0.012; Table 1). 
All patients were regarded as optimally treated by their physi- 
cians, and pharmacological treatment was characterized by a 
relatively high number of evidence-based therapies with regard 
to inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system, beta-blockers, and 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (Table 1). There were a 
number of serious co-morbidities but there was no statistically 
significant difference between the two groups (Table 1). Twelve 
patients died during the study; the remaining 60 patients completed 
the study. 
Euro Qol-5D: health-related quality of life 
No difference was found between the two treatment groups 
at baseline for HRQL assessed with the EQ-5D. At 6 months, 
the PREFER group had an increased HRQL, from 47.7 ± 19.4 to 
60.4 ± 20.6, compared with 48.2 ± 23.1 vs. 52.3 ± 23.2 for controls 
(age-adjusted P-value = 0.10). The between-group analysis of the 
age-adjusted delta-value of HRQL from baseline to 6 months was 
significantly (P = 0.02) better for patients in the PREFER group than 
for controls. 
If the last measurement at 1, 3, or 6 months was analysed, 
the delta-difference of HRQL, after adjusting for age, was still 
significantly better (P = 0.04) in the PREFER group. 
For the five dimensions of the EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), no significant 
differences were found between the groups (data not shown). 
In a paired within-group analysis of the PREFER group, HRQL 
increased 28% from baseline to 6 months (from 46.9 ± 21.3 to 
60.4 ± 20.6, P = 0.013). If all measurements of HRQL (1, 3, and 6 
months) were included, the increase was 20% (from 48.2 ± 19.8 to 
57.6 ± 19.2, P = 0.026). Corresponding values for the control group 
were 3% (from 50.7 ± 24.2 to 52.3 ± 23.2, P = 0.61) and 1.0% (from 
48.7 ± 24.0 to 49.6 ± 23.8, P = 0.74), respectively. For the other 
dimensions, no significant differences were found. 
The Edmonton Symptom Assessment 
Scale 
No significant differences were found between the PREFER and 
control groups in regard to any item of the ESAS scale or after 
adjusting for age difference (data not shown). Nausea was signif- 
icantly improved (2.3 ± 2.7 vs. 1.2 ± 1.7, P = 0.02) in the PREFER 
group, but not in the control group. Numerical improvements were 
observed in eight out of nine items in the PREFER group compared 
with four out of nine in the control group. The item ‘other’ was 
not included due to very few answers,

Relapses and rehospitalizations are very common in patients 
with CHF. This condition has the highest rate of rehospitalization 
at departments of medicine21 and is very costly and resource 
demanding.22 County councils expend much effort, with limited 
success, to reduce both the length of stay and rehospitalization for 
these patients. In line with Kossovsky et al.,23 Clarke,24 and Ekman 
et al.,20 we also support the idea that relapses and length of stay and 
rehospitalization can be reduced by improving the quality of care, 
and that common practice should be rethought and re-evaluated 
with regard to shortening of the length of hospitalizations through 
rapid discharge after symptom relief. Another type of structure of 
CHF care also seems to be needed.9 The management of patients 
with CHF and their co-morbidities is very complex and a challenge 
to all of the healthcare personnel and systems involved. While CHF 
is largely managed in primary care in mild to moderate stages, 
the problems arise in more advanced situations, especially when 
the syndrome of CHF is accompanied by co-morbidities. This is 
not easily handled by primary healthcare physicians.25 A bridge 
between acute care of CHF at hospitals and primary healthcare 
has been successfully fulfilled by heart failure clinics,26 which focus 
primarily on the management of heart failure. The strategy of 
PREFER goes beyond traditional heart failure management in clinics 
by including specialized palliative care as practised for cancer 
patients. One of the main differences from standard heart failure 
management is that PREFER also takes more comprehensive care 
of accompanying co-morbidities. The team is responsible for the 
total care of the patient. Assessment of symptoms, QoL, and risks 
of decubitus, falling, and malnutrition is continual. This does not 
mean that responsibility is removed from the patient’s general 
practitioner or other specialists, but rather that they are included 
care plan; required organization of services; symptom manage- 
ment; identifying end-stage heart failure; breaking bad news to the 
patient and family; and establishing new goals for care. The PREFER 
model also includes goals of support to relatives/bereavement and 
to the team members.12 The strategy used in the PREFER model 
goes beyond traditional heart failure management at hospitals by 
including person-centred and specialized palliative care. 
One of the main differences from standard heart failure manage- 
ment is that the PREFER team takes more comprehensive care of 
the person, taking into consideration symptoms and signs related 
to accompanying co-morbidities, such as stroke, renal dysfunction, 
pulmonary disorders, anaemia, and even cancer, which were com- 
mon in the present study. 
In the PREFER group, we used PCC in addition to the identity- 
promoting care concept applied to palliative care planning.12 
Earlier studies showed that being met as a person (i.e. with trust 
and a willingness to help) by professional caregivers at home seems 
to increase feelings of security,18 and that seeing the patients in 
their home situation helps the team to tailor care to the persons’ 
way of life.19 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study 
to evaluate a new approach for CHF management by integrating 
specialized palliative home care and heart failure care. This study 
provides new information about the PREFER model resulting in 
improved HRQL, total symptom burden, and NYHA functional 
class in association with reductions in the number of hospitaliza- 
tions and days spent in hospital at both the Medicine-Geriatrics 
and Surgery departments. These findings are in line with the 
results of the PCC-HF study,20 which showed that PCC during 
in-hospital care impacts the length of stay in the hospital and 
maintained functional performance. 
Table 3 Distributions, mean values, and changes of functional classes at the end of study, and total number and mean 
number of hospitalizations per patient during the study 


‘optimally treated’ by their physician before inclusion in the study, a 
number of patients had their medications re-evaluated, up-titrated, 
and rigorously checked according to optimal evidence-based ther- 
apy for CHF. Nevertheless, the impact of physiological, psychoso- 
cial, and spiritual problems should be recognized. The continuity 
of the team, accessibility, and the possibility of visits and examina- 
tions at patients’ homes are important measures for lessening the 
patient’s total symptom burden. The confidence, availability, and 
trust in the PREFER team may have had a substantial impact on 
patients’ HRQL and need for hospital care. Also, the involvement of 
a wife or husband and other relatives may be important.30 A num- 
ber of explanations are possible as the PREFER concept involves 
different strategies involving specialist competences from different 
areas: general practitioners and doctors trained in palliative care, 
cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists. 
We consider that the PCC has had a substantial impact on the 
results. One of the main differences between the two strategies 
was the nurse visits at the patient’s home, which were substantially 
and significantly more frequent in the PREFER group compared 
with the usual care group. This made it possible to carry out the 
structured, PCC at home. Moreover, besides the updating of drug 
treatment according to recent guidelines both for drug treatment 
and device therapy, we hypothesize that the continuity of the same 
personnel, being a rather small group, was of importance. The pos- 
sibility for the patients to reach the personnel easily by phone and 
that treatment often could take place at the patient’s home instead 
of them being admitted to hospital may have contributed to the 
achieved results. These steps of the PREFER concept may have cre- 
ated confidence in and reassurance by the care given and reduced 
patients’ anxiety. 
Further research is needed to evaluate the separate impact 
of each component of the PREFER concept, if possible, and its 
contribution to the beneficial effects found in the present study. 

Our findings have a number of limitations. First, patients in the 
PREFER group were significantly older than those in the control 
group, but this difference was adjusted for in the follow-up analyses. 
Secondly, the outcome analyses were not blinded; functional class 
was evaluated by physicians involved in the trial. Questionnaires 
were filled out by participating patients who knew the group to 
which they belonged. This may have introduced some bias into 
the symptom reporting and assessment of NYHA classes. Thirdly, 
this study was small and at a single centre, which should be 
considered when interpreting and generalizing the study findings. 
Although the number of patients was limited, a strength of this 
study was that we included patients with a high number of severe 
co-morbidities that are seldom accepted in most randomized 
clinical trials. The exclusion criteria were mostly for practical or 
administrative reasons, so we consider the patients in this study to 
be representative of many elderly patients with moderate to severe 
CHF treated in hospitals and primary healthcare.

in the collaboration. PREFER is also organized in close co-operation 
with out-of-hours palliative advanced home care. This team is 
fully informed of the identities of the patients and knows how to 
respond to calls. 
On the other hand, PREFER differs from traditional palliative 
care by including active heart failure treatment with acute heart 
resuscitation if needed, according to the patient’s expressed 
desire.19,27 Even more important is the intention to use all modern 
pharmacological treatments and other types of devices, such as 
CRT, if necessary, to reduce symptom burden. The decision to 
include this form of active treatment arises from the difficulty 
in defining a transition point to palliative care for heart failure 
patients.19,27,28 Their lives are sometimes described as ‘living near 
death’ or ‘a roller coaster life’, i.e. an ongoing oscillation between 
ups and downs.18 The unpredictable progression of the illness 
leads to a great risk that these patients and their close relatives 
will not have access to palliative care.1,5 
The mechanisms underlying the favourable results are not evi- 
dent. Several components are probably related to each other, and 
it could be difficult to separate them to explain the effectiveness 
of the intervention.29 In some cases, the recognition of important 
co-morbidities is more important than the syndrome of CHF per 
se. In other cases, undertreatment of the CHF condition may be 
an explanation. Despite the participating patients being regarded as .

Patient-centred care seemed to relieve the physical, physiological, 
social, and spiritual problems of patients with severe CHF by 
improving HRQL, functional class, and total symptom burden, and 
reduced hospitalizations and the number of days spent in hospital. 
Our findings also challenge the traditional way of caring for elderly 
patients with CHF and accompanying co-morbidities.
