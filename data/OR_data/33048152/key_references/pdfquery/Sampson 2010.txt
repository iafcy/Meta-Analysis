Abstract 
Patients with advanced dementia often receive poor end-of-life care. We aimed to design and pilot a palliative care and 
advance care plan (ACP) intervention. Patients had undergone emergency hospital admission and had severe dementia. 
The intervention consisted of a palliative care patient assessment which informed an ACP discussion with the carer, who 
was offered the opportunity to write an ACP for the person with dementia. Carer–patient dyads were randomized to 
‘usual care’ or the intervention. Carer-related outcome measures included the Kessler Distress Scale, Decision 
Satisfaction Inventory, Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Euroqol-5D, measured at baseline, six weeks, six 
months and three months after bereavement. The Satisfaction with End of Life Care in Dementia Scale was completed 
if the patient died. The 32 patient participants were physically frail and in the advanced stages of dementia: 62% had 
pressure damage to the skin, all needed feeding assistance and 95% were in pain. Nearly 50% died during the six-month 
follow-up period. Carers were difficult to recruit during acute admission; 33 patients and carers entered the study 
(22 intervention arm; 11 control arm). Only seven carers made ACPs. The care planning discussion was well received, 
but few carers wrote an ACP, despite intensive support from an experienced nurse specialist. Advance care planning is, in 
theory, a necessary intervention for people with severe dementia; the reluctance of carers to write plans needs to be 
explored further.

The UK government’s End of Life Care Strategy aims 
to improve care for those with all life-limiting condi- 
tions, not just cancer.1 With the ageing population, 
dementia is increasing, occurring in 20% of those 
aged 80 or over. One in three people over the age of 
65 years will die with dementia,2 many of them on acute 
general hospital wards where they receive poor end-of- 
life care.3 
A systematic review of the literature on palliative 
care interventions for people with advanced dementia 
found a lack of adequately powered clinical trials and 
that ‘palliative care’ was deﬁned as a withdrawal of 
treatment or single interventions rather than a holistic 
approach.4 An unplanned acute hospital admission is a 
critical event for a person with dementia in that 24% of 
those with severe dementia will die and at six months 
post admission mortality is as high as 50%.5,6 Whilst 
various interventions have been developed to enhance 
advance care planning in nursing homes, for example 
the ‘Let me Decide’ programme in Australia7 and the 
UK Gold Standards Framework,8 no studies have 
focussed on the acute hospital. This may be an appro- 
priate time to intervene and plan end-of-life care. The 
need for this is supported by qualitative research on 
the views and wishes of carers and health and social 
care professionals working with people with severe 
dementia.9 
In this pilot study we aimed to assess the feasibility 
intervention to 
implementing a two-component 
of 
improve end-of-life care for people with advanced 
dementia. We report recruitment and randomization, 
attrition, explore a range of outcome measures and 
assess whether advance care planning is feasible for 
these patients and their carers. 
Methods 
A full description of the protocol has been published.10 
The study was approved by the local Research Ethics 
Committee. 


Phase 
intervention was designed using 
the Medical Research Council 
(MRC) Complex 
Interventions Framework.11 In phase one qualitative 
work the principal carers of 20 patients with severe 
dementia, 
(Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) 
stage 6d and above12) admitted to an acute medical 
ward were interviewed. Concurrently, 21 health care 
professionals from a range of disciplines, experience 
and care settings (acute hospital, nursing home and pri- 
mary care) were also interviewed. We used framework 

analysis to identify, extract and analyse core themes.13 
illness awareness, com- 
Five main themes emerged: 
munication, pain awareness, attitudes towards end- 
of-life treatments/quality of life and hospitalization. 
Awareness of the terminal nature of advanced dementia 
was poor amongst both carers and health care 
professionals.9 
Phase II. The qualitative data were used to design a 
two-component intervention: (i) assessment of the pal- 
liative care needs of patients; and (ii) a framework for 
the discussion of advance care planning with carers. 
To obtain the most pragmatic version of the interven- 
tion, we used an iterative process, interviewing succes- 
sive groups of patients, carers and members of the 
clinical multi-disciplinary team. Protocol reﬁnements 
were referred to the ethics committee for approval. 
This cycle was repeated twice. The intervention was 
delivered by a senior nurse experienced in dementia 
who also received palliative care training. 



Final format of the intervention 
Component 1: palliative care needs assessment of 
patient. The patient assessment 
took 30 minutes 
using a structured clinical approach that built on 
usual care. It covered a range of domains, including 
dementia severity (measured on the FAST scale12), 
the presence of delirium (Confusion Assessment 
Method14), 
risk 
(Waterlow scale15) and severity (Stirling scale16), food 
and ﬂuid intake, swallowing and feeding. As there are 
no dementia pain scales validated for use in an acute 
hospital setting,17 we used observational pain scales 
developed for use in other settings: the Abbey Pain 
Scale,18 the PACSLAC19 and the Doloplus.20 The 
latter two scales have been identiﬁed in a recent sys- 
tematic review as the most appropriate and clinically 
useful tools for detecting pain in people with demen- 
tia.17 This assessment generated a list of active prob- 
lems 
team. 
that were discussed with the clinical 
A management plan was formulated and documented 
in the clinical notes. Findings were used to inform sub- 
sequent discussions with the carer. 
Component 2: discussions with carers. Up to four 
consultations (at least ﬁve days apart) were oﬀered to 
carers. At ﬁrst we attempted these discussions during 
the hospital admission (see Figure 1, CONSORT dia- 
gram ‘Original Design’). However, it was diﬃcult to 
engage carers at this time and patients were often dis- 
charged rapidly. We therefore amended the protocol 
(see Figure 1, CONSORT diagram ‘New Design’) to 
allow the carer discussion to occur in the community 
at a later date. 






First consultation: we used structured discussions 
with carers to assess: (i) level of knowledge about the 
patient’s dementia; (ii) the severity of dementia and 
prognosis for the patient; (iii) the patient’s physical 
needs; (iv) the social situation and current levels of 
social support; and (v) any records of previous prefer- 
ences for care. We attempted to understand cultural, 
spiritual, health, social and ﬁnancial needs experienced 
by the carer and the psychological support available to 
them. We inquired whether the person with dementia 
had made any previous advance directives or state- 
ments or had expressed any preferences for care. The 
discussion was summarized, and documented in a stan- 
dardized format. Any issues of serious concern were 
discussed with the clinical team. 
Subsequent consultations: we provided basic educa- 
tion on dementia as a neuro-degenerative disease, the 
prognosis of advanced dementia, the role of palliative 
care (focusing on palliative care as appropriate active 
care, NOT withdrawal of treatment) and advance care 
planning. Some carers wanted only basic information 
whilst others wished to receive as much information as 
possible. Speciﬁc issues discovered during the patient 
needs assessment were documented on a sheet that 
was used to guide this structured discussion. For exam- 
ple, if we identiﬁed that the person with dementia was 
showing non-verbal pain behaviours, we explained and 
interpreted these with the carer so that they could rec- 
ognize these in the future. 
Advance care planning. Advance care planning is a 
process of discussion between the patient and a health 
care professional including important values or goals 
for care, understanding about illness and prognosis 
and preferences for types of care or treatment that 
may be beneﬁcial in the future.21 People with advanced 
dementia may not have the have capacity to make com- 
plex decisions, thus carers were given the opportunity 
to formulate an advance care plan (ACP), including 
statements of preferences and wishes for the person 
with dementia using an adapted version of a tool devel- 
oped by the UK National Health Service (NHS) 
(Preferred Priorities for Care).8 The carers were asked 
to consider any views that the person with dementia 
may have expressed, whilst they still had the capacity 
to do so. Copies were placed in the medical notes, sent

Feasibility randomized controlled trial of the 
intervention with patient–carer dyads 
We piloted this intervention in a two-arm feasibility 
cluster randomized controlled trial. We recruited from 
two acute medical wards served by separate medical 
teams, for patients aged 70 years or over, in an inner 
London teaching hospital serving a socioeconomically 
and ethnically diverse population. All new admissions 
on the intervention ward and control ward were 
screened for eligibility. We recruited patients with 
advanced primary degenerative dementia (FAST stage 
6d or worse: urinary incontinence and needing assis- 
tance with all activities of daily living) with an 
unplanned admission for a treatable acute medical ill- 
ness. Patients were included if they had an informal carer 
(family member or friend in regular contact, who did not 
act in any professional capacity, and who was next of kin 
or a ‘key decision maker’) who was able to give informed 
consent and assent for patients. Those consenting in the 
control arm were fully informed about the trial and 
received usual care. We aimed to recruit 40 patient– 
carer dyads to each study arm. As this was a pilot trial 
no power calculation was required and these numbers 
were chosen on pragmatic grounds. 
Measures. Our main outcome was the number of 
carers making an ACP. We also tested a number of 
other outcome measures. Data on these was collected 
by an independent researcher. 

Kessler Distress Scale (KD10): a 10-item scale giving 
a total ‘distress score’ (range 10–50, higher scores indi- 
cating a higher level of distress) and a categorical score 
indicating whether participants are ‘likely to be well’, 
‘likely to have a mild mental disorder’, ‘likely to have 
moderate mental disorder’ or ‘likely to have a severe 
mental disorder’. 
Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D): a measure of health status 
and quality of life, this comprises a ﬁve-item scale 
and a visual analogue scale indicating overall health 
state (scored 0–100 with lower 
indicating 
poorer health).22 

Decision Conﬂicts Scale (DCS): measures uncer- 
tainty and diﬃculties in the decision making process.23 
Scores range from 0 (no decisional conﬂict) to 100 
(extremely high decisional conﬂict). 
Decision Satisfaction Inventory (DSI): gives an over- 
all score of decision satisfaction (range 10–50, higher 
scores indicating less satisfaction).24 
State Anger Scale (SAS): a subscale from the State- 
Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), which 
measures intensity of angry feelings at a particular 
time.25 Scores range from 10 to 40, with higher scores 
indicating greater levels of anger. 
Life Satisfaction Scale (LSQ): obtained from the 
Lancashire Quality of Life Proﬁle, this is a seven- 
point ‘ladder scale’ anchored at 0, representing the 
‘very worst outcome that you could expect to have in 
life’ and increasing to 7, with the top representing ‘the 
very best outcome you could have expected’.26 
Satisfaction with End of Life Care in Advanced 
Dementia Scale (SWC-EOLCD): measures satisfaction 
with end-of-life care (range 10–40) with higher scores 
indicating greater satisfaction. This was only completed 
after the patient had died, if the carer felt able, without 
undue distress. 
We also included a general assessment of how care 
planning was experienced and noted whether the carer 
decided to formulate an ACP. 

Pain and distress: carers were asked to indicate on 
visual analogue scales how much pain and distress 
they thought the person with dementia was experienc- 
ing. Scores ranged from 1 (no pain/no distress) to 5 
(severe pain/severe distress). 

Guided by current evidence on survival time and prog- 
nosis for this patient group, follow-up assessments 
occurred at six weeks and six months.5,6 Relatives of 
patients who died during the study were seen three 
months after the death to complete the DSI, Caregiver 
Strain Questionnaire (CSQ), EQ5-D, KD10, LSQ, SAS 
and SWC-EOLCD scales. We also investigated whether 
information could be collected about the care received at 
death. A qualitative analysis of how the structured 
assessment of patient needs may have inﬂuenced subse- 
quent patient and carer experiences will be reported in a 
further case-study paper. 
Results 
Protocol amendments 
The acute hospital admission was often not a suitable 
time for carers to take part in research as their main 
concern was the patient’s care. We amended the study 
protocol to allow recruitment, consent and randomiza- 
tion at an individual level. Carer discussions were then 
oﬀered after the person with dementia had left hospital. 
Computer-generated random allocation was performed 





by an independent statistician. This removed the need 
for clustering at ward level and maximized recruitment 
(see Figure 1). Carers in both control and intervention 
groups were oﬀered an information pack compiled 
from publicly available internet information and leaf- 
lets. This included an information sheet from the UK 
Alzheimer’s Society on advanced dementia, a leaﬂet on 
advance care planning and one giving a simple deﬁni- 
tion of palliative care. 

were not contactable, ﬁve patients (4%) died (original 
design), 35 (31%) declined and 34 (30%) consented. 
Thirty-three entered the study, 22 in the intervention 
arm and 11 in the control arm. Of these 33, 31 (94%) 
completed the baseline assessment, 15 (45%) the ﬁrst 
follow-up assessment and 11 (33%) the second follow- 
up assessment. Twenty patients were assessed, and 
17 carers took part in the carer discussions. Three 
patients died prior to ﬁnishing the discussions and 
two carers dropped out after the ﬁrst meeting. Seven 
carers made an ACP. 
Recruitment and attrition are shown in Figure 1. 
We approached 384 patients with severe dementia. 
Seventy one (19%) had no available next of kin, 
18 (5%) were discharged before they could be assessed 
for eligibility or before consent from carers could be 
obtained (original design), 76 (20%) did not have 
severe dementia, 43 (11%) died and 64 (17%) were 
not eligible for other reasons, such as no clear diagnosis 
and adult protection issues. One hundred and twelve 
were eligible. Of these, 39 (35%) carers of patients 

The mean age of the patients was 87 years and the 
cohort was predominantly female (81%). Half had 
either urinary tract infections or pneumonia, and 41% 
had one or more re-admissions to hospital during the 
six-month study period. Sixty-nine per cent were admit- 
ted from residential or nursing homes. Carers (mean 
age 59 years), were mainly daughters and not involved 
in an active caring role (Table 1). There were no major

tance, 14 (63%) had poor oral intake and two were 
artiﬁcially fed. Thirteen patients (59%) had some 
degree of dysphagia and were on ‘risk management’ 
feeding. All were doubly incontinent. 
Findings from patient assessments in the 
intervention group 
The 22 patients in the intervention group were mainly 
bed-bound, although 10 (45%) spent some time in a 
chair. On the Stirling Scale, 38% had intact skin, 
23% had discolouration of intact skin, 28% had partial 
thickness skin loss or damage to the epidermis or 
dermis and 2% had full thickness skin loss. The mean 
Waterlow score was 21.6 (SD 4.5, range 14–33), and 
57% scored more than 20, indicating a high risk of 
Communication. All 22 patients had diminished levels 
of language. Seven (32%) were able to state simple pref- 
erences for food, indicate the presence of pain or under- 
stand simple instructions such as ‘open your mouth’. 
The remainder used non-verbal communication, such 
as facial expressions. Six (27%) of the most severely 
aﬀected patients (FAST scale 7d or 7f) displayed dis- 
tressed behaviour during care tasks. 
Pain. On the Abbey pain scale, one patient (5%) 
had no pain, nine patients (45%) had mild pain and

10 (50%) had moderate pain. None was assessed to 
have severe pain. Pain was chronic in ﬁve patients 
(25%), acute in four (20%) and acute or chronic in 
11 patients (55%). On the Doloplus-2 scale, the mean 
score was 8 (SD 6.5, range 3–22), and 67% scored 
above the cut-oﬀ point (5 or above) indicating the pres- 
ence of pain. Mean scores on the PACSLAC scale were 
8 (SD 5.4, range 3–22). This scale does not currently 
have a scoring interpretation available. 
Of the seven carers who completed an ACP, two had 
clear wishes about the place of death and level of inter- 
vention preferred. The remaining ﬁve chose more open 
statements, such as, ‘the family is aware of the compli- 
cations related to swallowing diﬃculties but wish to 
make decisions about artiﬁcial feeding if and when 
needed’. None of the patients had expressed clear pref- 
erences to their carers about end-of-life care when they 
still had capacity. 
Spiritual and religious needs. The religious aﬃliation 
of all patients was noted from carer interviews. Those 
who agreed to a care planning discussion said they 
wished their relative’s religious needs to be respected 
at the time of death. Two patients were atheists and 
their carers emphasized that they should not be visited 
by a hospital chaplain. No unmet spiritual needs were 
identiﬁed. 
Findings from carer discussions. It was diﬃcult to 
conduct discussions in the hospital as no private 
room was available. Research interviews were not 
seen as part of clinical care and some carers preferred 
to remain at the patient’s bed side. Using the amended 
protocol, discussions were held in the community where 
it was easier to discuss sensitive issues. 
Some carers were very knowledgeable about the 
patient’s status and prognosis, while others needed 
more time to explore the patient’s situation. The 
seven carers who chose to make a written ACP were 
closely involved in the patient’s care, saw them on most 
days of the week, viewed themselves as being key in co- 
ordinating and managing their relative’s care and had 
witnessed their progressive deterioration. Two of the 
patients with an ACP died during the study period, 
both remaining in their home at the time of death as 
requested by the carer. 

Attrition precluded statistical comparison of control 
and intervention groups, but some trends are suggested 
by the data (Table 3). Mean KD10 distress scores were 
higher in the cohort at baseline (mean 21.3) and 
decreased by the time of the ﬁnal assessment (mean 
14.7), 
(mean 
increasing again around bereavement 
19.7). The proportion of carers who were rated in the 
‘well’ category of the KD10 and the LSQ also showed a 
similar trend, with improvement in the months follow- 
ing the patient’s index admission. Decisional conﬂict 
was higher at the time of hospital admission and 
increased in the carers receiving the intervention at 
each time point. Carer perceived health, as measured 
on the EQ-5D, improved after the initial admission. 
There were no observable trends in the carer ratings 
of patients’ pain or distress. 
We needed to access GP records of deceased patient 
to assess the end-of-life care received. We obtained eth- 
ical committee permission for this, but some GPs did 
not allow access. One GP sought legal advice and stated 
that unless we were able to show that the carer was a 
legal representative of the patient, that is, that they 
were executor of the patient’s will, they were unable 
to let us view records. Obtaining such documentation 
was outside of the remit of this research. 






































We were able to develop a clinically pragmatic inter- 
vention building on phase I work and informed by 
guidance from the MRC framework for developing 
complex interventions.11,27 Our intervention comprised 
a specialist assessment of the patient’s palliative care 
needs that informed an advance care planning discus- 
sion with the carer. The discussion aimed to aid future 
decision making and therefore improve the quality of 
and satisfaction with end-of-life care. Participation of 
the clinical multi-disciplinary team in reaching the ﬁnal 
format of the intervention facilitated its integration 
with the clinical service. 

We had hoped to recruit 40 patient–carer dyads to each 
study arm. However, we achieved 32 patient–carer 
dyads of whom 22 received our intervention. We 
found the acute medical ward a challenging environ- 
ment in which to conduct this study. A third of patients 
admitted with advanced dementia did not have an 
informal carer/next of kin who could discuss and con- 
sider ACPs, rapid treatment and discharge of patients 
meant that 10% left the hospital before contact with 
carers could be made and carers were focussed on the 
immediate care of patients. As this was a pilot study, we 
modiﬁed our methodology to try and improve recruit- 
ment. We continued to conduct patient assessments 
during the admission but found the discussion with 
carers was best carried out after the person with demen- 
tia had been discharged from hospital. Despite this 
amendment, recruitment rates remained low, suggest- 
ing that the time of acute hospital admission was not 
optimal for engaging carers in advance care planning. 
Follow-up rates were low due to patient mortality and 
carer withdrawal. 

Our study population was in the advanced stages of 
dementia and physically frail: two thirds showed signs 
of pressure damage to the skin, all needed feeding assis- 
tance and 95% were experiencing mild or moderate 
pain. Of the 32 participants, nearly half died during the 
six-month follow-up period. This concords with other 
work5 suggesting that our recruitment strategy correctly 
identiﬁed patients who were nearing the end of life. 

This was mainly observational and much of 
the 
required information could be obtained during routine 

care tasks. Establishing whether the patient fulﬁlled 
study criteria was problematic; information about func- 
tion prior to admission was not always available and 
those with milder dementia may appear more advanced 
when physically ill. Nursing homes and GP surgeries 
were not willing to provide this information for a 
research project. The structured assessment was well 
received by clinical staﬀ, particularly the information 
it provided regarding communication ability and pain. 
The assessment did not appear to cause distress to the 
patient and in a number of patients we found previ- 
ously undetected pain; this was the principle informa- 
tion that was fed back to clinical teams. 

We explored a range of outcome measures. The KD10 
appeared sensitive in detecting carer distress around the 
time of hospital admission and after bereavement. The 
LSQ showed a similar pattern of response. The SAS did 
not show any trends during the study but, as would be 
expected, levels of anger did increase in carers during 
bereavement. Because of this we would anticipate just 
using the KD10 in future work. Decisional conﬂict 
appeared to increase in the intervention group as the 
study progressed. This may be due to chance or because 
carers who received the intervention were presented 
with more options and possibilities to consider, increas- 
ing the decisional conﬂict that they experienced. Carers 
reported that the SWC-EOLCD was easy to complete 
and the range of scores in our cohort reﬂected that 
found in the North American population used to vali- 
date the scale.28 This scale shows high convergent valid- 
ity with the DSI28 and in further studies we would 
consider just using the SWC-EOLCD to reduce the 
burden of study measures. 

Advance care planning is a cornerstone of the gov- 
ernment’s end-of-life care strategy,1 but we found it 
diﬃcult to engage carers in formulating these. Only 
seven ACPs were made during this study, despite that 
fact that 22 patient–carer dyads received the interven- 
tion. Reasons for choosing not to make an ACP were 
complex and included conﬂicting family dynamics and 
a general unwillingness to address end-of-life care 
issues. Most diﬃculty occurred in accepting what was 
going to happen in the future, with an unwillingness to 
make decisions about hypothetical future scenarios. 
The number choosing to make a written ACP does 
not necessarily measure the full eﬀect of the interven- 
tion and may not be the most appropriate outcome. 
All carers were keen to receive more information 
about end-of-life issues in dementia and to have an 





opportunity to express their concerns. They found 
the discussions very helpful, even if they did not go 
on to make an ACP. Perhaps these should be seen 
as part of a process of preparing carers for terminal 
stage of dementia. We found that the simple pack 
information about dementia was well received 
of 
by carers. 


This pilot study highlights a number of methodological 
challenges. The acute hospital was not an easy environ- 
ment in which to recruit study participants. Patients 
with advanced dementia do not have capacity to con- 
sent and many do not have carers to give assent for 
them. A randomized controlled trial of advance care 
planning for people over the age of 80 years, after 
acute hospital admission, has shown positive results 
but all of these study participants had capacity to par- 
ticipate.29 Alternatively, 
advocates 
employed within the remit of the Mental Capacity 
Act may need to ensure that these patients receive 
better end-of-life care. Despite the fact that the study 
had ethics approval and carers gave consent for their 
participation and assent for the patient, we had great 
diﬃculty in accessing GP records to enable us to doc- 
ument care received at the end of life. We were unable 
to establish the reasons why so many carers withdrew; 
however, carers of people with dementia are often 
stressed and burdened.30 Most of the carers in our 
study were daughters who lived away from the person 
with dementia and had full-time employment. The 
drop-out rates may be explained by the fact that this 
was not perceived to be an active ‘treatment trial’ that 
could directly improve patient care. 

Our intervention was delivered by a highly experienced 
nurse with a background in acute medical and dementia 
care. Over 100 patients were assessed for eligibility but 
only seven ACPs were made. Although most carers said 
they found the discussions helpful, many were reluctant 
to formulate an ACP. It has been suggested that dis- 
cussion and provision of information are the most 
useful part of advance care planning with proxies,31 
but it is diﬃcult to measure the ‘beneﬁt’ of these.32 
the person with dementia should consider 
Ideally, 
making an ACP whilst in the earlier stages of the dis- 
ease, when they have the ability to discuss such issues 
and can be more actively involved in making choices 
for their future care. There is evidence that older people 
who view a video depiction of a patient with advanced 
dementia are more likely to opt for comfort as their 
goal of care compared with those who just listen to a 
verbal description;33 such tools could be adapted for 
people in the early stages of dementia. 

it is important to publish this ‘negative’ 
ﬁnding. Research governance and diﬃculties in access- 
ing GP and community notes may mean that alterna- 
tive methodologies to the randomized controlled trial 
need to be explored. Caplan et al.7 demonstrated 
reduced hospital admissions after an advance care 
planning intervention for nursing home residents, 
but this occurred in the context of a whole system. 
The UK Gold Standards Framework8 
includes 
advance care planning for frail older people with 
dementia and audit data from this suggests an impact 
on end-of-life care. Demonstration of beneﬁt may 
require a ‘systemic’ approach rather than our individual 
approach.34 

Given the pressures of the acute medical environment, 
this intervention could not simply be added to routine 
clinical care. It may be that a speciﬁc staﬀ role is 
developed to perform this work, which will have 
cost implications for acute trusts. This needs to be 
balanced against potential savings achieved by avoid- 
ing inappropriate acute hospital admissions at the end 
of life.35 Advance care planning is a key aspect of the 
government’s End of Life Care Strategy but this may 
not be feasible where proxies are involved for those 
lacking capacity. More evidence is needed on the ben- 
eﬁts of ACPs developed by people with dementia 
before they lose capacity. 
Increasing evidence in 
other long-term conditions suggests that substantial 
proportions of people do not wish to make such 
plans.36 This may be due to underlying attitudes 
related to denial of death, a belief in taking ‘one day 
at a time’ or the ‘impossibility’ of planning for the 
future.36 Our pilot study has highlighted challenges 
in this type of work.
