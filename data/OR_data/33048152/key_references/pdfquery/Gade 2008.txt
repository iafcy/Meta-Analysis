Background: Palliative care improves care and reduces costs for hospitalized patients with life-lim- 
iting illnesses. There have been no multicenter randomized trials examining impact on patient sat- 
isfaction, clinical outcomes, and subsequent health care costs. 








Results: IPCS reported higher scores for the Care Experience scale (IPCS: 6.9 versus UC: 6.6, 
p (cid:2) 0.04) and for the Doctors, Nurses/Other Care Providers Communication scale (IPCS: 8.3 ver- 
sus UC: 7.5, p (cid:2) 0.0004). IPCS patients had fewer intensive care admissions (ICU) on hospital read- 
mission (12 versus 21, p (cid:2) 0.04), and lower 6-month net cost savings of $4,855 per patient (p (cid:2) 
0.001). IPCS had longer median hospice stays (24 days versus 12 days, p (cid:2) 0.04). There were no dif- 
ferences in survival or symptom control. 
Conclusions: IPCS patients reported greater satisfaction with their care experience and providers’ 
communication, had fewer ICU admissions on readmission, and lower total health care costs fol- 
lowing hospital discharge.

recognized as suboptimal.1–8 Particularly in hos- 
pital settings, patients and families have reported in- 
adequate pain and symptom relief as well as unwanted 
life-sustaining treatment at the end of life.9–11 Assis- 
tance for patients and families as they attempt to un- 
derstand complex medical information including prog- 
nosis and treatment options appears to be less than 
adequate.12 Hospice referrals tend to be initiated late 
in the course of illness despite the positive association 
between hospice length of stay and family perceptions 
of the benefits.13–15 
In recent years, hospital-based palliative care (PC) 
programs have been developed to address these defi- 
ciencies.16–20 These interventions are designed to im- 
prove symptom management, help patients and fami- 
lies better understand prognosis and treatment options, 
clarify goals of care, and assist in planning for disease 
progression.21–24 
Interdisciplinary PC teams are believed to be par- 
ticularly helpful in addressing the full spectrum of pa- 
tients’ health, spiritual, and psychosocial needs, and 
aligning treatment choices with patients’ values and 
goals.25 
Evidence of the effectiveness of interdisciplinary in- 
patient PC in improving clinical outcomes, satisfac- 
tion with hospital care, and use of hospice is lim- 
ited.25–31 Information on subsequent health services 
utilization is even less available.28,32–34 There have 
been no prospective, multisite, randomized control tri- 
als to assess the efficacy of inpatient PC interven- 
tions.28,38–43 
We hypothesized that an interdisciplinary inpatient 
palliative care consultative service (IPCS) would dem- 
onstrate improved symptom control, increase patient 
satisfaction with care and decrease the cost of health 
services received over the subsequent 6 months after 
hospital discharge. 


IPCS was a three-site, prospective, randomized trial 
comparing outcomes of an IPCS to usual care (UC) in 
patients hospitalized with a life-limiting illness. En- 
rollment occurred between June 2002 and December 
2003. Eligible patients were members of the same in- 
tegrated health plan from three regions: Denver, Col- 
orado, San Francisco, California, and Portland, Ore- 
gon. The study was approved by the Institutional Re- 
view Boards of the health plan and hospitals. 
Eligible patients were 18 or more years of age, hos- 
pitalized with at least one life-limiting diagnosis, and 
whose attending physician indicated they “would not 
be surprised if the patient died within 1 year.” The ef- 
fectiveness of this question in identifying patients who 
were appropriate for palliative care services has been 
reported previously.44–47 Patients were excluded if 
they had impaired cognitive status and no surrogate or 
were currently enrolled in hospice or other PC stud- 
ies. Referrals were received from all medical services 
and inpatient units. Study enrollment occurred Mon- 
day through Friday. 
Written informed consent was obtained from the pa- 
tient or proxy before study participation and random- 
ization. After a baseline questionnaire was adminis- 
tered the patient was randomly assigned to IPCS or 
UC using a computer-generated, randomized assign- 
ment list for each site. Following study randomization, 
IPCS was initiated for those patients randomly as- 
signed to the intervention arm. 
San Francisco and Portland hospitals were part of a 
managed care organization’s (MCO) delivery system. 
Denver’s community hospital had a contract with the 
MCO. The hospital size was 102, 225, and 383 beds, 
respectively. All hospitals had MCO hospitalist physi- 
cians. At two sites hospitalists served as the attending 
physicians. Portland’s hospital used a combination of 
MCO hospitalists and primary care internists. The ma- 
jority of Portland patients (72%) were followed by hos- 
pitalists. All hospitals had social workers and chap- 
lains on staff that provided direct patient services to 
UC patients. 

The IPCS teams included a palliative care physician 
and nurse, hospital social worker and chaplain. In Den- 
ver and Portland the teams were newly formed for the 
study while San Francisco’s team had been operating 
for a year. All teams provided care in accordance with 
key palliative care components which were adapted 
from Weismann (Table 1).48 The teams assessed pa- 
tients’ needs for symptom management, psychosocial 
and spiritual support, end-of-life planning, and post- 
hospital care. All of the team’s efforts were based on 
the patient’s individual goals of care. 
The team met prior to each consultation to share 
what was known about the patient from the medical 
record, baseline questionnaire, and hospital providers. 
The entire team then met with the patient/family to ad- 
dress symptoms, diagnosis, prognosis, and goals of 






patient/family knowledge and 
perception of disease treatment and 
prognosis 






psychological, spiritual, and practical 
needs: fear of dying, anxiety about 
afterlife, denial of impending death,

fied and advance directive forms were discussed. Af- 
ter the patient/family meeting, the team convened 
briefly to synthesize a palliative care plan and orga- 
nize follow-up by team members. IPCS provided con- 
sultation on intervention patients to the attending, in- 
volved subspecialists and staff on all aspects of PC, 
including treatment recommendations. The team was 
available Monday through Friday. A PC physician was 
on call after hours. 
The teams collaborated with the attendings and dis- 
charge planners in preparing for the patient’s dis- 
charge. The PC discharge plan was communicated to 
the primary care physicians through documentation in 
an electronic medical record. If intervention patients 
were readmitted to the hospital they were again fol- 
lowed by IPCS for PC needs. 
To ensure treatment consistency there were bi- 
weekly telephone conferences among the three sites to 
review cases and promote protocol adherence. Each 
site was visited early in the study to assess protocol 
adherence, and intervention patients’ medical records 
were reviewed to ensure that all treatment components 
were addressed. 



The primary study outcomes were symptom con- 
trol, levels of emotional and spiritual support, patient 
satisfaction, and total health services costs at 6 months 
postindex hospitalization. Secondary measures in- 
cluded survival, number of advance directives (ADs) 
at discharge, and hospice utilization within the 6 
months postindex hospitalization (hospitalization dur- 
ing which study enrollment occurred). 
Surveys were administered to patients or proxies at 
study enrollment and within 2 weeks following index 
hospitalization discharge to measure symptom control 
as well as emotional and spiritual support. Patient sat- 
isfaction was also measured within 2 weeks of index 
hospital discharge. Proxies were instructed to answer 
the survey items as they thought the patient would. 
Symptom severity was measured using the Physi- 
cal Area scale of the Modified City of Hope Patient 
Questionnaires (MCOHPQ).51 The Physical Area 
scale addresses pain, fatigue, sleep changes, nausea, 
constipation, diarrhea, dry mouth, change in appetite, 
and shortness of breath. Higher scores indicated 
greater symptom severity. 
Patients rated their emotional and spiritual support 
using items taken from the MCOHPQ Emotional/Re- 
lationship Area and Spiritual Area scales.51 Emotional 
support items included: anxiety, burden to family, sup- 
port they received, isolation, opportunity to discuss ill- 
ness and possible death, and treatment wishes/goals. 
Higher scores indicated greater emotional burden. 
Spiritual support included: the importance of partici- 
pation in spiritual or religious experiences from the 
Spiritual Area scale, and two items developed by the 
investigators: ability to find meaning in one’s life, and 
support given by religion or spiritual belief. Higher 
scores reflected greater support. 
The patient’s satisfaction with their inpatient expe- 
rience was measured by the MCOHPQ Place of Care 
Environment scale and the Doctors, Nurses/Other Care 
Providers Communication scale.51 The Place of Care 
Environment scale addressed experiences receiving 
pain management and symptom relief, psychological 
and social support, discharge planning, and end-of-life 
planning. Higher values indicated more positive feel- 
ings. The Doctors, Nurses/Other Health Care Provid- 
ers Communication scale addressed the level of car- 
ing and respect a patient felt from their providers, as 
well as the opportunity, ease, and the level of under- 
standing the patient had with their providers. 
Higher scores represented greater caring, respect 
and understanding between patients and their provid- 
ers. A composite score for each scale was computed 
by summing the scores for all items in a scale and di- 
viding the sum by the number of items completed. 
Cronbach (cid:2), a measure of internal consistency was 
computed for each scale. Cronbach (cid:2) were: 0.66 for 
Physical scale, 0.18 for Emotional/Relationship scale, 
0.65 for Spiritual scale, 0.65 for the Place of Care 
Environment scale, and 0.65 for the Doctors, Nurses/ 
Other Health Care Providers Communication scale. 
These (cid:2) indicate fair agreement among the individual 
items for the Physical and Spiritual scales but a lack 
of agreement for the Emotional/Relationship scale. 
Physical performance was measured using the East- 
ern Cooperative Oncology Group performance scale 
(ECOG).52 The total number of comorbidities, a mea- 
sure of disease burden, was obtained with the RxRisk 
score program. This program uses a patient’s prior 12 
months of prescriptions to identify the presence of dis- 
tinct chronic diseases based on common medications 
prescribed for each chronic disease.53 
Costs were computed for all health services used 
within the 6 months following index hospitalization 
discharge. These services included emergency depart- 
ment, clinic, hospital outpatient, and home health vis- 
its, hospital readmissions, skilled nursing facility ad- 
missions, and pharmacy fills. Costs of health services 
were assigned using the predetermined internal MCO 
rate structure and vendor contracts based on per diem 
and case rate calculations. ICU admission data was 
only available for the Denver and San Francisco sites. 
The cost of each palliative care team was computed 
based on the total time for each team member multi- 
plied by the team member’s hourly wage and benefits. 
Hospice measures included the number of patients 
enrolled in hospice, the number of days from study en- 
rollment to hospice enrollment, and hospice length of 
stay (LOS). All measures, including mortality, were 
obtained from the MCO’s databases using standard 
data extract protocols. 

All analyses were performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS 
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A p value (cid:2) 0.05 was sig- 
nificant. Categorical variables were summarized as 
percentages; continuous variables as means or medi- 
ans (for skewed data). Continuous measures for IPCS 
and UC patients were compared using t tests for nor- 
mally distributed measures and Wilcoxon two-sample 
tests for measures with skewed distributions. Cate- 
gorical measures were tested using (cid:3)2 tests or Fisher’s 
exact test. All time to event measures (e.g., survival, 
days to hospice admission) were analyzed using Cox 
proportional hazard models. 
Patients with life-liming illnesses often have phys- 
ical and cognitive limitations that necessitate the use 


of proxies, which was the case in this study. We re- 
port the combined patient and proxy survey data here 
because analysis of the separate patterns of patient and 
proxy responses to the scales were similar. 
Comparisons in total health costs between the IPCS 
and UC group used a non-linear model with a nega- 
tive binomial distribution and log link. Costs were not 
transformed because the log link accounts for skewed 
distributions. The model was adjusted for site, age, 
gender, and the number of days a patient could use 
medical services. Costs are presented as total costs per 
patient. IPCS team costs were included in the net costs 
savings. 

The IPCS received 1168 referrals for study enroll- 
ment (Fig. 1). Five hundred fifty-one patients did not 
meet inclusion criteria (cognitive impairment with no 
surrogate, were currently enrolled in hospice or other 
PC studies, or the attending did not approve study par- 
ticipation), were discharged or died prior to informed 
consent, refused to participate, or were excluded for 
un-documented reasons (Fig. 1). We randomly as- 
signed 517 patients to IPCS (n (cid:2) 280) or UC (n (cid:2) 
237). Five IPCS patients withdrew prior to the initia- 
tion of IPCS services at the encouragement of a fam- 
ily member, resulting in 275 IPCS patients. No pa- 
tients were lost to follow-up. 

Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 2. 
There were no differences in any baseline measures 
between the IPCS and UC groups except for the life- 
limiting diagnoses of stroke and end-stage renal dis- 
ease (ESRD).

Number of days from index hospital admission to 
study enrollment, days from enrollment to hospital dis- 
charge, and hospital LOS did not differ between the 
IPCS and UC patients (Table 3). There was no differ- 
ence in mean total costs between groups for their index 
hospitalization (IPCS: $20,783; UC: $15,841, p (cid:2) 0.08). 

IPCS patients had significantly longer median hos- 
pice stays than UC participants (IPCS: 24 days; UC: 12 
days, p (cid:2) 0.04; Table 3). The median days from study 
enrollment to hospice admission was 1 day shorter for 
IPCS patients compared to UC patients but the differ- 
ence was not significant (p (cid:2) 0.14). The percentage of 
patients admitted to hospice did not differ (p (cid:2) 0.50). 
There was no difference in survival between IPCS 
and UC. Median post enrollment survival was 30 days 
for IPCS and 36 days for UC (p (cid:2) 0.08), and 173 IPCS 
patients (63%) and 132 UC patients (56%) died dur- 
ing the study period (p (cid:2) 0.08). Significantly more 
IPCS patients (17.1%) died during their index hospi- 
talization compared to UC patients (8.0%; p (cid:2) 0.002; 
Table 3).

IPCS and UC mean enrollment and discharge scores 
for the Physical, Emotional/Relationship, Spiritual 
Area composite scales as well as the Quality of Life 
scale are shown in Table 4. There were no differences 
between groups for any scale. 

While there was no difference in the number of ADs 
at study enrollment (Table 2), IPCS patients completed 
significantly more ADS at hospital discharge than UC 
patients (91.1% vs. 77.8%; p (cid:3) 0.001; Table 3).

Total mean health costs for the IPCS group were 
lower by $6,766 per patient compared to UC patients 
(IPCS: $14,486; UC: $21,252, p (cid:2) 0.001). After sub- 
tracting the cost of staffing the IPCS ($1,911 per pa- 
tient), the net savings was $4,855 per patient. Cost sav- 
ings were largely driven by a significant difference in 
hospital readmission costs (IPCS: $6,421 per patient ver- 
sus UC: $13,275 per patient, p (cid:2) 0.009). There 
was no difference in the number of hospital readmis- 
sions but IPCS patients had significantly fewer ICU stays 
on readmission (IPCS: 12; UC: 21, p (cid:2) 0.04; Table 6). 

Key findings include greater IPCS patient satisfac- 
tion with hospital care and providers, longer hospice 
length of stay, more advanced directives at index hos- 
pitalization discharge, no difference in overall sur- 
vival, reduced ICU admissions on subsequent hospi- 
talization, and lower total health costs. 
We believe greater patient satisfaction was achieved 
due to IPCS addressing the patient’s and family’s need 
for information and facilitating their active participa- 
tion in decisions regarding their medical care. In- 
creased patient satisfaction has been reported from pre- 
vious research on palliative care interventions.28,29,43 
We found no differences in physical symptoms 
which is inconsistent with other studies on inpatient 
palliative care interventions.23,38,42,43 In particular, we 
found no differences in pain symptoms from study en- 
rollment to index hospitalization discharge. There are 
several possible explanations. First, patients in this 
study reported relatively low physical symptoms at 
study enrollment. The mean pain rating on a scale of 
1 to 10 was 3.4 suggesting that pain was less than in 
other reported populations whose symptoms were 
more severe.23,42 Second, the average index hospital-

ization LOS after study enrollment was 4.9 days, a 
shorter time for the IPCS team to manage complex 
physical symptoms compared to studies with longer 
interventions.23,42,43 Finally our patient population 
survived for a longer period of time indicating they 
might be earlier in their disease state than other inpa- 
tient palliative care patients.34,58 
There was no difference in the proportion of patients 
enrolled in hospice, but IPCS patients had longer hos- 
pice stays. MCOs have higher rates of hospice utiliza- 
tion and longer hospice stays compared to fee for ser- 
vice.55 As all participants were MCO members, it is 
possible that IPCS would not be able to increase an al- 
ready high hospice enrollment rate. Finally, patients and 
their families may not have considered hospice at their 
index hospitalization because this was not an option they 
felt necessary at this stage in the patient’s illness. 
We were not surprised that we had significantly 
more ADs at index hospital discharge because ADs 
were addressed with each intervention patient. In- 
creased ADs subsequent to palliative care interven- 
tions is consistent with the literature.27 
There was no difference in the number of inpatient 
readmissions between the IPCS and UC, but IPCS pa- 
tients had lower inpatient readmissions costs. These 
lower readmission costs are partially explained by 
fewer ICU admissions. Reduced ICU admissions may 
have been due to more clearly defined patient goals of 
care and more effective communication of these goals 
in the medical record and through advance directives. 
Other studies have found decreased ICU admissions.34 
Overall survival between IPCS and UC patients did 
not differ. However, more IPCS patients died during 
their index hospitalization, which was attributed to a

difference at one site. IPCS patients at this site had a 
median 3 day longer hospital stay than the UC group. 
This site’s team reported difficulty transitioning pa- 
tients to other care venues near the end of life. There 
was no difference in mortality between IPCS and UC 
patient over a 14-day period postenrollment, whether 
or not they were still hospitalized, indicating that over- 
all mortality was not different at that site. 
The IPCS intervention did not vary among sites with 
respect to the components or core features of the in- 
tervention. However, uniqueness in the hospital cul- 
ture, variability in palliative care staffing levels, pa- 
tient support available at discharge, individual team 
members’ palliative care experience, and the func- 
tionality and maturity of each team did vary between 
sites as would be expected. Further study would be 
needed to understand if any of these factors might af- 
fect patient outcomes. 
Other areas that would benefit from future research 
include which components of the palliative care inter- 
vention are most effective in achieving positive out- 
comes and how to apply the interdisciplinary pallia- 
tive care team in other care settings. 
We identified two study limitations. One limitation 
of the study was the lack of some measurable process 
measures, e.g., what symptoms and issues were helped 
by which components of the IPCS. A second limita- 
tion was participants in this study were members of a 
health plan with an integrated medical delivery system 
which may limit generalization of study outcomes in 
other settings. 
This study provides evidence for the positive im- 
pact of IPCS consultations on satisfaction with care 
and decreased health care costs. It also contributes new 
information on the impact of this service on ICU ad- 
missions and hospice utilization. Based on this data, 
all three sites are continuing to offer palliative care 
to hospitalized members. In addition, the integrated 
health plan is implementing new IPCS programs na- 
tionally.
