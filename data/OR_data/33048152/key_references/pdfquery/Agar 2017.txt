Palliative care planning for nursing home residents with advanced dementia is often subopti- 
mal. This study compared effects of facilitated case conferencing (FCC) with usual care 
(UC) on end-of-life care. 

A two arm parallel cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted. The sample included 
people with advanced dementia from 20 Australian nursing homes and their families and 
professional caregivers. In each intervention nursing home (n = 10), Palliative Care Planning 
Coordinators (PCPCs) facilitated family case conferences and trained staff in person-cen- 
tred palliative care for 16 hours per week over 18 months. The primary outcome was family- 
rated quality of end-of-life care (End-of-Life Dementia [EOLD] Scales). Secondary out- 
comes included nurse-rated EOLD scales, resident quality of life (Quality of Life in Late- 
stage Dementia [QUALID]) and quality of care over the last month of life (pharmacological/ 
non-pharmacological palliative strategies, hospitalization or inappropriate interventions).

Two-hundred-eighty-six people with advanced dementia took part but only 131 died (64 in 
UC and 67 in FCC which was fewer than anticipated), rendering the primary analysis under- 



powered with no group effect seen in EOLD scales. Significant differences in pharmacologi- 
cal (P < 0.01) and non-pharmacological (P < 0.05) palliative management in last month of 
life were seen. Intercurrent illness was associated with lower family-rated EOLD Satisfaction 
with Care (coefficient 2.97, P < 0.05) and lower staff-rated EOLD Comfort Assessment with 
Dying (coefficient 4.37, P < 0.01). Per protocol analyses showed positive relationships 
between EOLD and staff hours to bed ratios, proportion of residents with dementia and staff 
attitudes. 

FCC facilitates a palliative approach to care. Future trials of case conferencing should con- 
sider outcomes and processes regarding decision making and planning for anticipated 
events and acute illness. 



Care in advanced dementia requires a palliative approach focused on quality of life (QOL) [1– 
4]. Nursing home residents with advanced dementia often receive suboptimal palliation due to 
limited staff awareness and training [2, 5–14]. Communication between staff, health services 
and families (including surrogate decision-makers) addressing palliative care needs is often 
poor [6, 7]. Decisions include whether hospital transfers and acute interventions such as intra- 
venous antibiotics will offer net benefit versus detriment to QOL [8, 9, 12, 15–18]. Surrogates 
should be involved in symptom management decisions and care planning, and provide the 
personal context [7, 10, 14]. 

ers to build consensus on goals of care and appropriate steps for current management and 
advance care planning. Case conferencing shows promise for improving symptom manage- 
ment in people with dementia living in nursing homes but systematic reviews have highlighted 
methodological weaknesses in the evidence base [19, 20]. Evidence from randomised con- 
trolled trials (RCTs) in the community palliative care setting is more compelling with better 
maintenance of physical and mental health [21] and decreased hospitalization seen, [22] pro- 
vided the process is facilitated by appropriate training and organizational support [23–25]. 

in improving end of life (EOL) care for persons with advanced dementia living in nursing 
homes. 
Methods 
Study design 
A cluster RCT design was used because the intervention aimed to change the approach to 
dementia palliative care across nursing homes and randomizing individual residents or staff 
members would have resulted in contamination. The parallel cluster RCT design is described 
in a published protocol [26] (see also S1 File), and was conducted over a predefined study 



period of 18 months between February 2013 to December 2014. Human Research Ethics Com- 
mittees of the University of NSW, University of Technology Sydney, Queensland University of 
Technology approved the trial. This paper focuses on the study’s first aim, namely to compare 
the efficacy of a facilitated approach to family case conferencing with usual care. As such, it 
focuses on data relevant to evaluating quality of end of life (EOL) care for participants who 
died during the study period. Data relevant to understanding processes influencing implemen- 
tation and evaluating cost-effectiveness will be reported in other papers. Details are reported 
according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Checklist for Cluster Randomised 
Controlled Trials (see S1 Table). 

The study’s statistician (GL) generated a block randomization schedule using a computer-gen- 
erated allocation sequence, and allocated nursing homes to each arm after collection of institu- 
tional-level baseline data, stratifying by organizational affiliation. Due to the system-level 
nature of the intervention, participating investigators, project managers and nursing home 
managers could not be blinded to the evaluative aim of the research or to nursing home alloca- 
tion. Staff, residents and families at each nursing home were blinded to the evaluative aim of 
the study, but those in nursing homes allocated to the intervention arm were aware of associ- 
ated changes to practice (see below). Research staff were blinded to the evaluative aim of the 
study and collected data from nursing homes in only one arm to reduce the likelihood they 
would notice systematic differences in practice. 

Sites were 20 nursing homes in two major Australian cities meeting the following criteria: 1) 
(cid:21)100 beds, 2) (cid:21)50% people with dementia, and 3) designated as facility providing intensive 
level of nursing home care. Nursing homes were identified from an Australian government 
website list [27] and approached in alphabetical order to minimise selection bias. 

The MORECare initiative[28] informed target participants, namely people with advanced 
dementia living in residential care (‘residents’) where surrogate decision-maker involvement 
for palliative care planning is needed. Potentially eligible residents were identified by nursing 
home managers and screened by the study team. Residents needed to have dementia docu- 
mented in nursing home records and advanced dementia as determined by scores on the: 1) 
Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST)[29] in dementia ((cid:21)6a, stable for 1 month), and 2) 
Australia–modified Karnofsky Performance Status (AKPS) [30] (cid:20)50. These criteria were cho- 
sen because a FAST stage 7c combined with functional dependency (measured here by the 
AKPS) is predictive of an average survival of <6 months, and the study’s primary endpoint 
focused on end of life care [31]. A family member with legal authority provided written 
informed consent on behalf of the resident. Either the same or another family member 
involved in making decisions about the resident’s care also gave written informed consent for 
their own participation in the study. Written informed consent was collected after randomiza- 
tion of nursing homes. 
All permanent registered and enrolled nurses and care assistants of participating nursing 
homes were invited to join the study via staff meeting presentations and email circulars and 
gave informed consent after randomization of nursing homes. 





Facilitated case conferencing (FCC). Theoretical frameworks underpinning FCC 
included the expected trajectory of advanced dementia [2] and evidence-based strategies for 
organizational culture change (clinical leadership [32] and train-the-trainer[33]). A Registered 
Nurse was trained as a Palliative Care Planning Coordinator (PCPC) in each nursing home 
working for 2 days per week or equivalent to: 1) identify residents with advanced dementia 
likely to benefit from a case conference; 2) organise, set an agenda, chair and document case 
conferences with optimal participation by family, multi-disciplinary nursing home staff and 
external health professionals (e.g. General Practitioner’s (GP’s)); 3) develop and oversee imple- 
mentation of palliative care plans; and 4) train nursing and direct care staff in person-centred 
palliative care. The key features of the case conference model were: use of pre-defined specific 
clinical triggers for a case conference; used a shared agenda setting model where the resident, 
their family and all multidisciplinary staff could specify a priori areas for discussion; required 
attendance of the resident and/or their substitute decision maker or family member(s); was 
facilitated by the PCPC to ensure optimal participation of attendees; and was followed by a 
communication strategy to summarise actions and plan arising from the case conference. Dis- 
cussion topics were not limited and were individualised to what was seen as important for the 
resident; and could include care planning, current and future treatment decision making, 
information sharing, meeting resident preferences or needs and advance care planning. 


support was provided. No restrictions were placed on nursing homes’ education programme, 
or approach to care planning and decision-making. 

Details of baseline, process and outcome data are provided in the published protocol [26]. Res- 
ident-level measures used validated measures in advanced dementia which perform well with 
surrogate report. Data on resident and nursing home variables likely to influence EOL care 
[34], and FCC fidelity was also collected. All nurse and family-rated measures were collected 
via face-to-face or telephone interview with the research team. 

[35] optimally assessed four to six weeks following the residents death: a) symptom-related 
comfort during the last 7 days of life (Comfort Assessment in Dying with Dementia; CAD– 
EOLD); b) symptom management in the last 90 days of life (Symptom Management at the 
End of Life in Dementia; SM–EOLD); and c) family or caregiver’s satisfaction with care during 
the last 90 days of life (Satisfaction With Care at the End of Life in Dementia; SWC–EOLD). 
Resident-level secondary outcomes were nurse-rated CAD-EOLD and SM-EOLD ratings as 
soon as possible following the resident’s death; nurse-rated QOL three monthly (Quality of 
Life in Late-stage Dementia (QUALID) Scale [36]), and symptoms and care in the last month 
of life extracted from nursing home and medical records (symptom control medication [e.g. 
analgesics] versus diagnosis oriented [e.g. antibiotics, anti-epileptics, anxiolytics, steroids] 
commencement, cessation and dose alteration; non-pharmacological strategies [e.g. family 
attendance, body positioning]; symptom assessment frequency; acute care episodes and poten- 
tially inappropriate non-palliative interventions [ventilation, resuscitation, enteral feeding, 
intravenous antibiotics and fluids, dialysis, transfusion, oxygen and surgery). Comorbidities 
were collected from the resident record classified as life threatening (e.g. cancer, organ failure, 
neurological), disabling (e.g. hearing/vision, musculoskeletal) or inter-current acute (e.g. 
infections). 




palliative care to people with advanced dementia (Palliative Care for Advanced Dementia 
[qPAD] [37]); ratio of nursing staff hours to beds; and proportion of residents with dementia. 
Fidelity to protocol (intervention ‘dose’) at the resident level was collected for use in per 
protocol (PP) analyses, but could not be measured as planned [26] as many UC nursing homes 
did not routinely collect detailed information about case conferences (e.g. triggers, attendance, 
issues discussed), and encouraging this data collection may have led to contamination. A sim- 
pler dose measure was used, namely whether or not participating residents received a case 
conference during their time in the study. Dose at the nursing home level consisted of four 
indicators concerning the extent to which PCPCs: 1) were able to work 2 days per week, 2) 
were supported by managers, 3) fulfilled expectations outlined in training, and 4) diffused 
their role among other staff. Each indicator was scored 0, 1 or 2, with 0 representing a lesser 
extent, 1 a moderate extent and 2 a large extent. 

Assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05 (estimated from unpublished 
data sourced from Dutch nursing homes), a sample size of 8 clusters per arm with 15 residents 
(who died during the study period and for whom EOL outcomes would be available) per clus- 
ter (i.e. N = 240 in total), was considered adequate to identify a between-arm difference of 0.5 
standard deviation (SD) on the EOLD scale with a two-sided 5% significance level and power 
of 80%. We conservatively anticipated a 10% resident dropout rate (e.g. withdrawal of consent 
to participate in the study; resident moved to another nursing home). Allowing for this, a 
recruitment target of 272 people with advanced dementia (17 per site) was set. This calculation 
incorporated an estimate that almost all people (98%) meeting the inclusion criteria would die 
(and so yield data on EOL care) within the study period (<18 months) based on review of 
dementia- specific mortality data from local nursing homes and evidence from the literature 
relating to prognostic variables referred to above [31, 38]. In other words, with a 10% with- 
drawal rate and 2% survival rate, of 272 participants we would expect 27 to withdraw, and of 
the remaining 245, five to survive to the end of the study period, resulting in a total sample size 
of 240 available for analysis. 

Between-arm differences at baseline in resident and nursing home characteristics and second- 
ary outcomes were analysed using two-tailed t-tests for continuous variables where the distri- 
bution was normal or the Mann-Whitney U z-test where distribution was significantly 
skewed. Chi-square tests were used to determine whether differences were significant on cate- 
gorical variables. 
Analyses of primary and secondary outcomes were on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. 
Generalised linear mixed models (GLMMs) were used to analyse the impact of the interven- 
tion on EOL care (EOLD) and quality of life (QUALID; last measurement during the 90 days 
prior to resident death). GLMMs were run without adjustment to the dependent variables, and 
following an evaluation of model best fit using information criteria, were conducted assuming 
normal distributions with identity links. Residual plots were visually inspected to ensure there 
were no substantial deviations from normality or homoscedasticity. GLMMs allow for the 
inclusion of fixed and random effects in the model. These models account for nested sources 
of variability in data, such as when residents with different characteristics are clustered within 
nursing homes. In these models, the nursing home was included as a random effect, account- 
ing for intra cluster-correlations in the sample and consequently producing better fixed-effect 



estimates. While some nursing home level variables were included in the models, the inclusion 
of a random effect allows for other unmeasured nursing home level effects. In all models, there 
were resident-level control variables (comorbidities: presence or absence of a disabling condi- 
tion, an inter-current acute condition, or a life-threatening condition) and nursing home-level 
control variables (proportion of residents with dementia; baseline ratio of nursing staff hours 
to bed number; and median staff qPAD Knowledge Test and Attitude Scale scores). These 
models were rerun in a series of Per Protocol (PP) analyses, excluding nursing homes from the 
FCC arm that did not implement the intervention to any degree planned (i.e. had a score of ‘0’ 
on all four nursing home dose variables), and including the resident-level dose variable of 
whether or not a case conference was received. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM Corp., 
Armonk, NY). Alpha, the significance level threshold, was set at 0.05 for all statistical tests. 

Forty-nine nursing homes were approached to recruit the 20 needed (Fig 1). Reasons for 
declining to participate included a lack of interest in research, other research projects or confi- 
dence in their case conferencing and palliative care programs. Due to difficulties recruiting 
facilities, three facilities were included who had less than 100 beds (two UC with 46 and 88 
beds; one FCC with 75 beds). Three hundred and nineteen residents were assessed for eligibil- 
ity, with 25 not eligible. Informed consent was obtained for 294 residents, and four died prior 
to the intervention period commencing and four withdrew. The baseline sample comprised 
130 residents (UC facilities) and 156 residents (FCC facilities). During the study, 131 (46%) 
participants died, 64 in UC and 67 in FCC. Median time to death was 7 months (inter-quartile 
range [IQR] 9), with no difference between the UC and FCC arms (P = 0.27). 

are in Table 1. Participants in FCC and UC arms had similar baseline characteristics, though 
FCC participants were more likely to be born in Australia and were visited less frequently. 
FCC and UC nursing homes were similar in proportion of people with dementia during the 
previous 3 months and nursing staff hours to bed ratios. However, nurses and care assistants 
in the FCC arm had significantly higher baseline qPAD knowledge scores, indicating a greater 
knowledge of palliative care for advanced dementia. 

Family-reported EOL outcomes were available for approximately three-quarters of the partici- 
pants who died (76%, 99/131), with no systematic differences in demographic characteristics for 
people with or without a family EOLD report. Family-rated EOLD measures were completed at 
a median 7.3 weeks (IQR 5.7; range 2.7 to 24 weeks) and nurse reports at a median 2.4 weeks 
(IQR 4.0; range 0 to 22 weeks); Table 2 outlines summary statistics. There was no significant 
group effect on the EOLD scales in any of the models (i.e. family-rated CAD-EOLD, SM-EOLD 
and SWC-EOLD or nurse-rated CAD-EOLD and SM-EOLD). 
ICCs for the CAD-EOLD and SWC-EOLD were less than assumed (0.008 and negative 
respectively) whereas for SM-EOLD the ICC was greater than assumed (0.124). Staff-reported 
EOLD were missing for four people. There was no significant group effect on the EOLD scales 
in any of the models. In the ITT models, presence of inter-current acute comorbidity was asso- 
ciated with lower family rated satisfaction with care (SWC-EOLD) and poorer staff rated com- 
fort level (CAD-EOLD) (see Table 3).

proportions of people with dementia in the nursing home, in addition to absence of inter-cur- 
rent acute comorbidities (see Table 4). Symptom management was rated as poorer by staff for 
those participants who had a case conference, regardless of treatment arm. In the FCC arm, 
69% (n = 46/67) of residents who died received at least one case conference compared with 
44% in the UC arm (n = 28/64) (P = 0.004). Staff ratings of CAD-EOLD were higher in nursing 
homes with higher proportions of people with dementia. CAD-EOLD was also rated as lower 
in people with a comorbid disability or with an inter-current acute condition.

more documentation of pain assessment frequency was seen in the FCC arm (97% (30/31)) 
than UC (79% (23/29)). Pain assessments were daily or more often in 40% of the FCC partici- 
pants (12/30) compared with 17% (n = 4/23) of those in UC (P = 0.08). 
The majority of participants died in the nursing home in both arms. Pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological changes to management, and physician input during the month prior to 
death were significantly more common in the FCC arm (see Table 5). Medication initiations 
in FCC were more frequently symptom-oriented (e.g. analgesics, laxatives) than diagnosis-ori- 
ented (e.g. antibiotics, anti-epileptics, anxiolytics, steroids). 

This RCT evaluated EOL outcomes of facilitated family case conferencing in advanced demen- 
tia from perspectives of EOL care received (satisfaction) and resident outcomes (comfort, qual- 
ity of life and quality of dying) [39]. While the study recruited sufficient participants overall, a 
lower than estimated mortality rate meant the participants with primary outcome data (after

death) did not meet target sample size. Although no significant intervention effects were 
observed on EOL outcomes or QOL, management was more consistent with a palliative 
approach in FCC. 
Higher rates of nurse-documented pain and restlessness, and more frequent pain assess- 
ment, which are less readily observed and under-reported symptoms[14], suggest increased 
awareness of symptoms as a result of FCC. Staff in both arms of the study tended to perceive 
symptom management as poorer for residents who had a case conference than those who 
didn’t, suggests case conferences foster proactive identification of symptoms. 
Resident and nursing home variables are also informative in understanding factors associ- 
ated with better EOL care. Inter-current acute comorbidities associated with lower family rat- 
ing of satisfaction with care and lower nurse-ratings of comfort, highlights the need to plan 
care not only for expected gradual decline and the last hours to days of life, but also for antici- 
pated acute illness, comorbidities and “crisis events” (e.g. aspiration pneumonia). Case confer- 
ences have also been used in nursing homes for other decision-making (e.g. behavioral and 
psychological symptoms of dementia) [40], and integration of these models is important. 
Quality of EOL care was associated with proportion of people with dementia, higher nursing 
and direct care staff hours and attitudes towards advanced dementia, consistent with previous 
evidence that being cared for in a dementia unit reduces likelihood of hospitalisation [41]. 
However, it is less clear why these relationships were observed only in the PP analyses or why 
staff knowledge about advanced dementia was not predictive of EOL care given its association 
with QOL in the last 90 days of life.

Our study has a number of limitations. The inclusion criteria aimed to capture a group of 
residents with advanced dementia with a high mortality rate. However, even with a participant 
population where nearly 40% were totally or completely bedfast (compared to 9% in the larg- 
est-scale study to date, the CASCADE [Choices, Attitudes, and Strategies for Care of Advanced 
Dementia at the End-of-Life] Study [38]) and an 18 -month study period (compared with 12 
months in the CASCADE Study), the mortality rate was only 46% (compared with 41% in the 
CASCADE Study). The local Australian data we further relied on to estimate mortality identi- 
fied a 50% mortality rate in high level care residents with all-stage dementia, but was not able 
to distinguish mortality due to dementia versus other comorbid illnesses or limit to those with 
advanced stage dementia only. We recommend that future studies should use more conserva- 
tive estimates utilizing published mortality rates. We followed previous trials of case confer- 
encing [42, 43] in taking a pragmatic approach aimed at improving external validity by 
reflecting the diversity of current practice [44, 45]. While staff, residents and families at each 
nursing home were blinded to the evaluative aim of the study, those in nursing homes in the 
intervention arm were aware of the introduction of the PCPC role and changes in case confer- 
encing and staff education and so may have been more inclined to report favourably on the 
quality of palliative care offered as a result. Whilst we introduced measures to limit sampling 
bias, it seems likely that participating nursing homes were more proactive in palliative care 
and quality improvement than the sector average. With the exception of one US [46] and one 
Dutch [47] study, mean scores for family and nurse ratings on the SWC-EOLD, SM-EOLD 
and CAD-EOLD across both arms were either comparable with, or higher than, those reported 
in the international literature [48–54], and hospitalization and potentially non-palliative inter- 
ventions use were low [12, 43]. It is also possible that we did not control for important con- 
founder, mediator or suppressor variables amongst the myriad resident, family and nursing 
home factors that may have been influential [55]. Whilst the EOLD Scales have demonstrated 
responsiveness in previous longitudinal research [56], their focus on end of life care may have 
lacked sensitivity to complex interactions with nursing home, staff, and family characteristics; 
missed benefits earlier in the person’s care, or failed to detect the surrogate decision-maker’s 
perceived support and engagement in decisions and care choices. Also, timing of EOLD scale 
administration occurred substantially later than the optimal window in many cases, risking a 
recall bias of unknown direction and similar across both arms. Measurement of family experi- 
ence, such as decisional conflict and bereavement, may also have been informative. Finally, 
dose measurement failed to incorporate case conference details, PCPC motivation and adher- 
ence to care plans, all of which may have affected EOL care. UC nursing homes can use more 
informal means other than case conferencing to share decisions with families (i.e. one-to-one 
conversations between nursing staff and families); such interactions where not captured in the 
dose measure but may have positively influenced EOL care and family satisfaction. It should 
also be noted that diagnosis-oriented medications are sometimes used with intent of symptom 
alleviation (e.g. corticosteroids for breathlessness from respiratory conditions) which may 
have led to underestimation of palliative pharmacological strategies. 

This study is one of the few RCTs of palliative care interventions in nursing homes worldwide, 
and appears to be the first to test efficacy of facilitated family case conferencing for people with 
advanced dementia. The study’s primary endpoint of quality of EOL care was under-powered 
and did not show evidence of effect. In spite of these limitations, a systematic approach to facil- 
itating a palliative approach and skills enhancement drove improvements in care. Given the 



growing burden of dementia globally, these data will be formative in interventions aimed to 
improving palliative care in nursing homes in the future.
