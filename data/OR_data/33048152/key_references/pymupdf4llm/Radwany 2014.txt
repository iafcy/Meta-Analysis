Abstract

### The specific aim of the PEACE pilot study was to determine the feasibility of a fully powered study to test the effectiveness of an in-home geriatrics/palliative care interdisciplinary care management intervention for im- proving measures of utilization, quality of care, and quality of life in enrollees of Ohio’s community-based long- term care Medicaid waiver program, PASSPORT. This was a randomized pilot study (n = 40 intervention [IG], n = 40 usual care) involving new enrollees into PASSPORT who were > 60 years old. This was an in-home interdisciplinary chronic illness care management intervention by PASSPORT care managers collaborating with a hospital-based geriatrics/palliative care specialist team and the consumer’s primary care physician. This pilot was not powered to test hypotheses; instead, it was hypothesis generating. Primary outcomes measured symptom control, mood, decision making, spirituality, and quality of life. Little difference was seen in primary outcomes; however, utilization favored the IG. At 12 months, the IG had fewer hospital visits (50% vs. 55%, P = 0.65) and fewer nursing facility admissions (22.5% vs. 32.5%, P = 0.32). Using hospital-based specialists interfacing with a community agency to provide a team-based approach to care of consumers with chronic illnesses was found to be feasible. Lack of change in symptom control or quality of life outcome measures may be related to the tools used, as these were validated in populations closer to the end of life. Data from this pilot study will be used to calculate the sample size needed for a fully powered trial. (Population Health Management 2014;17:106–111)


Introduction

hronic illnesses consume 95% of Medicare and 83% of
Medicaid spending.[1] As the population ages, the per# C
centage of the population with chronic illnesses is going to
increase.[2] The US health care system, as currently structured,
is not able to accommodate the needs of vast numbers of
chronically ill patients, nor is it able to sustain the current level
of spending.[3] For too long, the emphasis in chronic illness care
has been on acute episodic care rather than a more balanced
approach that includes prevention, symptom control, selfmanagement support, care coordination, and collaborative
community integration, with the consumer’s goals driving
care decisions. We now know that the lack of care coordination and poor communication of advance care wishes that
characterize the current system lead to avoidable health care
utilization and diminished quality of life.[4,5] Numerous dem

onstration projects and research studies have attempted to
improve care coordination; however, they have produced
mixed results.[6]

This article reports the outcomes of the Promoting Effective Advance Care for Elders (PEACE) randomized pilot
study.[7] PEACE was an in-home, interdisciplinary, evidencebased care management intervention delivered by Area
Agency on Aging (AAA) care managers, who coordinate
consumers’ care with a health system-based geriatrics/palliative care interdisciplinary team and the consumer’s primary care physician (PCP). PEACE targeted new dual
eligible enrollees in Ohio’s community-based, long-term care
Medicaid waiver program, PASSPORT. The term dual eligible refers to those consumers who are eligible for both
Medicare and Medicaid benefits. This intervention differs
from the previous care management literature in that (1) the
interventions are delivered in the home by community-based

long-term care providers who are already familiar with the
consumers, (2) the interventions are informed by recommendations from a combined geriatrics/palliative care interdisciplinary team from a neighboring acute care hospital
that is part of an integrated health system, and (3) the interventions are carried out in collaboration with the consumer’s
PCP. An emphasis on symptom management, medication
reconciliation, consumer activation for self-management, goal
setting, and coaching for completion of advance care planning characterize the PEACE intervention.
The purpose of this report is to describe the feasibility and
present the outcomes of the PEACE pilot study.
The theoretical framework for the PEACE study has been
published previously.[7] Briefly, Wagner et al[8] theorize that
optimal care for patients with chronic illness is not possible
in a traditional health care system that focuses on acute illness care, because primary care providers have limited time
to provide the necessary systematic assessments, preventive
interventions, patient education, and psychosocial followup.[9–12] Furthermore, when patients transition from one care
setting to another (eg, from the acute care hospital to ambulatory care), there is little or no communication between
providers, creating confusion about the appropriate plan of
care, as well as little emphasis on patient activation for selfcare and consumer-directed goal setting. According to
Wagner’s model, improvement in the care of patients with
chronic conditions can be brought about only when specific
changes occur in the health care delivery system, including
changes in organizational structure, establishing community
linkages/partnerships, providing effective self-management
support and activation, delivery system redesign, evidencebased decision support, and improved information systems.
The PEACE study incorporates the elements of Wagner’s
model with a palliative care focus and application of geriatric
medicine principles into a community-based, chronic illness
management model.

Methods

Inclusion criteria

The study included all new PASSPORT enrollees > 60
years old who passed a mental status screening (the Mental
Status Questionnaire[28]) and had one of the following: congestive heart failure and being actively treated (American
Heart Association stage C); chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and on home oxygen; diabetes with renal disease,
neuropathy, visual problems, or coronary artery disease;
end-stage liver disease or cirrhosis; cancer (active, not history
of ) except skin cancer; renal disease and actively receiving
dialysis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with history of aspiration; Parkinson’s disease stages 3 and 4; or pulmonary
hypertension. These criteria were established by expert
consensus and were chosen so that the intervention was
targeted at those whose illness severity made it more likely
that they would benefit from this geriatrics/palliative care
intervention. Active alcoholics (ie, those who drink - 2
drinks per day on average) and illegal substance users were
excluded, as well as clients who have schizophrenia or are
psychotic. These consumers were excluded because the authors’ previous care management trials have shown that
these other conditions tend to dominate the person’s life and
detract from their ability to participate in self-management


activities. Consumers who could not pass the Mental Status
Questionnaire were excluded because the intervention relies
heavily on chronic illness self-management and the ability of
an individual to make decisions about advance care wishes.
Consumers who were already enrolled in hospice also were
excluded.

Intervention Group

This study was approved by the Summa Health System
Institutional Review Board. A more detailed description of
the intervention was published previously.[7] Briefly, consumers were randomly assigned to specially trained PASSPORT care managers or to usual PASSPORT care. Within 3
weeks of enrollment into PASSPORT, consumers in the intervention group received the first of 2 in-home geriatric/
palliative care biopsychosocial needs assessments. The PCP
was informed by letter that his or her patient was in the
study and asked whether the patient had few or many
treatment options and whether the health care team was
aware of the patient’s wishes. This helped the team get a
more realistic picture of the patient’s medical status from the
start. The second visit occurred within approximately 2
weeks of the first and concentrated on consumer goal setting.
Within approximately 2 weeks of the second home visit,
there was an interdisciplinary team meeting to review the
findings of the care manager’s assessment. The core team included a hospice and palliative medicine specialist, a geriatrician, the PASSPORT care manager, a palliative care nurse
specialist, a social worker, a spiritual advisor, and a pharmacist. Extended team members, who were consulted as needed,
included physical and occupational therapists, a dietitian, a
geriatric advanced practice nurse, and a psychologist. The
team developed individualized, evidence-based care plans
based on standardized protocols that were developed for this
study and derived from an extensive literature review[13] that
included the Assessing Care for Vulnerable Elders guidelines,[14] the National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative
Care,[15] and the International Association of Hospice and Palliative Care Manual of Palliative Care.[16] A copy of this care
plan was sent to the consumer’s PCP.
The PASSPORT care manager discussed the care plan
with the consumer and family, when available, to ensure it
accurately reflected the consumer’s goals. Once the consumer and family were in agreement, the PASSPORT care
manager accompanied the consumer to a PCP visit solely
intended to review the plan with the PCP, gain his or her
buy-in, and provide ‘‘academic detailing.’’[17] PCPs were reimbursed as an incentive to participate with their patient in
the trial.
Once the care plan was agreed upon by all, the PASSPORT
care manager made another home visit to implement the plan
and to teach, activate, and coach the consumer and/or caregiver. This visit included teaching disease and symptom
management, identifying symptom management needs, developing an emergency response plan, addressing functional
needs, teaching caregivers about disease/symptom management, assisting with access to community resources, referring
to a counselor as needed for psychological support, assessing/
assisting with spiritual needs, addressing unmet medical
needs, reviewing medications, facilitating client/PCP/family
communication and completing legal documents recognized


-----

by the State of Ohio (ie, state Do Not Resuscitate and living will
forms). The Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment
(POLST) also was completed, although it is not legally binding
in Ohio. The decision was made to include it, in a slightly
modified form, because of its superior information content and
value in guiding advance care planning discussions. It was
included in the information consumers were asked to communicate to all health care providers. Consumers were provided with written self-management materials. Caregiver
needs also were assessed, when appropriate, using informal,
open-ended questions, and community supports were mobilized to meet identified needs. Consumers had access to either
the care manager or a hospital-based team member 24 hours/
day because acute exacerbations might otherwise prompt
consumers to seek help in the emergency department.[18]

The PASSPORT care manager followed up with the consumer by phone as needed, but at least monthly, for 12
months to determine whether the goals of care had changed.
If the consumer was re-hospitalized or if there was another
inflection point in the trajectory of their chronic illness, the
team assessment was updated and the goals of care were
reevaluated.

Usual care

Consumers randomized to usual care received usual
PASSPORT care, which follows more of a psychosocial rather than a biopsychosocial model. A letter was sent to the
PCP informing him or her that the consumer was enrolled in
the study. Consumers also received mailed palliative care
educational information every month in an attempt to mask
group assignment.

Outcomes

Outcomes recommended by the Outcomes Workgroup of
the US Cancer Pain Relief Committee[19] were used for this
pilot to promote ease of interpretation and aid in comparison
of outcomes between studies. The intervention was expected
to have a positive effect on these primary outcomes:

1) Symptom management (measured with the Memorial
Symptom Assessment Scale)[20]

2) Quality of life (measured with the QUAL-E)[21,22]

3) Mood (measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale)[23]

4) Decision making/care planning (measured with the
Palliative Outcome Scale)[24]

5) Spirituality (measured with the Meaning in Life Scale)[25]

Health care utilization data also were collected from the
AAA database. Outcomes were measured by a research
nurse blinded to group assignment.

Results

Forty consumers were randomized to the intervention
group and 40 to usual care. Baseline characteristics of the
PEACE population are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Chi-square
was used to compare proportions and Student t test was
used to compare means. No significant difference was found
in baseline demographics (Table 1). The difference in completion of durable power of attorney approached significance
in favor of the intervention group. Table 2 shows no differ

Over the course of the year, there were 7 deaths in the
intervention group and 7 deaths in the usual care group. The
number of days from enrollment to death was slightly longer
in the intervention group (189 days) compared to usual care
(150 days) but the difference was not statistically significant.
Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals for the primary outcomes at 6 and 12 months are shown in Table 3. As
would be expected in a feasibility study, all confidence intervals included zero, indicating no significant difference
between groups.

months. There were fewer consumers with hospital visits
and nursing facility placements in the intervention group.

interagency care management intervention to improve advance illness care in low-income, community-dwelling consumers with chronic illnesses who meet the criteria for
nursing home placement and are enrolled in a communitybased, long-term care Medicaid waiver program. Although
this pilot was not powered to detect statistically significant
differences between groups, preliminary findings indicate a
benefit of the intervention regarding acute hospitalizations
and long-term nursing facility placement at 12 months.
This study has demonstrated the feasibility of the PEACE
intervention with respect to the optimal staffing configuration, ability of care managers to implement the intervention,
functionality of the team, the optimal timing and frequency
of contacts with consumers, willingness of PCPs to participate and the ability to recruit, retain, and measure outcomes
for these consumers. The appropriateness of the inclusion
and exclusion criteria was confirmed as well as the expected
mortality rate. Most important, the study established the
ability of acute care and community-based providers to
collaborate successfully.
Nonetheless, several issues were identified that will require revision in a larger randomized trial. For example, this
pilot study used outcome measures from the domains recommended by the Outcomes Workgroup of the US Pain
Relief Committee.[26] The authors felt that the use of reliable
and valid palliative care measures was important to maximize the generalizability of the findings and to aid in comparison with other studies.[27] Furthermore, the authors felt
that the comprehensive nature of the intervention required
consideration of a broad range of outcomes (eg, quality of
life, symptom control) in addition to more common measures (eg, anxiety). Thus, the Memorial Symptom Assess

ment Scale, QUAL-E, Meaning in Life Scale, Palliative
Outcome Scale, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale were measured. Feedback from care managers, patients, and families revealed that most of these tools were
more appropriate for hospital-based practice and evaluation
of palliative care and not for an earlier, home-based geriatric/palliative care intervention. As a result, the authors recommend that future studies focus on outcomes more
reflective of the Triple Aim to achieve better care, better
health, and lower cost (ie, medication appropriateness,
health care utilization, patient activation, activities of daily
living, and instrumental activities of daily living, hospice
enrollment/place of death, consumer satisfaction, completion of the modified POLST, spirituality, anxiety, depression,
and quality of life).
At the beginning of the study, when the AAA and members of the acute hospital team began meeting, there was fear
that the added work of the study would overburden the care
managers. Indeed, the care managers were supposed to have
had their caseloads lightened during the study to accommodate the extra work. Unfortunately, this did not happen.
Nonetheless, the care managers carried out their study responsibilities, though they had some difficulty in undertaking advance care planning discussions with the limited
training they were provided. The authors believe that a
better model would be to hire a single trained palliative care
specialist care manager who could more easily assure that
comprehensive assessments, consumer goal setting, and advance care planning all take place. A better model also
would ensure that care managers are trained through a formal training model such as the Respecting Choices[29] certification course.
A formal cost-effectiveness analysis could not be undertaken because of the lack of access to the Medicare and
Medicaid databases. Nonetheless, estimates of the financial
costs versus benefits of the PEACE trial intervention can be
derived from available data. The authors have proposed to
build a better model for delivery of this intervention by
hiring specially trained geriatrics/palliative care case managers. Each case manager could deliver the PEACE interventions for an estimated 100 consumers per year, or
approximately $75,000 in salary per 100 consumers ($750/
year/consumer or $62.50/month/consumer). In addition, all
interdisciplinary team members participated in semiweekly
team meetings that lasted 2 hours. Calculating the approximate costs for all team members for 2 meetings per month

totals $1600 per month ($19,200/year) for 100 consumers
($192/year/consumer or $16/month/consumer). Thus, the
total cost per consumer would be approximately $942/year
or $78.50/month. Because investigators were not able to
accurately record emergency department visits, days in the
hospital, or days within a nursing facility (other than by
reports from care managers), the estimates of health care
costs must be based on these limited data. However, a 5%
decrease in hospitalization and a 10% drop in nursing facility
placements at 1 year were reported. An estimate of cost
savings based on average cost data obtained from Summa
Health System’s database can be derived from these numbers. Specifically, if the average cost of a single hospital stay
is $10,300, assuming only 1 hospital stay per year per
consumer, then hospital costs for each consumer would be
expected to be $10,300 per year. If the intervention reduces
the number of hospitalizations by 5%, there would be a
savings of $51,500 per year in the intervention group (n = 100;
$515/consumer/year or $42.92/consumer/month). Likewise, for costs of $5500 per month to care for a consumer in a
nursing facility ($66,000/year), the 10% decrease seen in
nursing facility placement in the intervention group would
have resulted in a savings of $55,000/month or $660,000/
year ($550/consumer/month for 1 month in a nursing facility to $6600/consumer/year for an entire year in a nursing
facility). Thus, the overall cost of the intervention is estimated to be $942/consumer/year or $78.50/consumer/
month and the overall savings are estimated to range from
$1065/consumer/year on average for 1 hospitalization and
1 month in a nursing facility to $7115/consumer/year on
average for 1 hospitalization and a 1-year stay in a nursing
facility; there would be a difference in favor of the intervention ranging from $123/consumer/year to $6173/
consumer/year.
A limitation of this study is the reliance on the AAA database for hospital admission and nursing facility admission
data. The authors acknowledge that there may have been
underreporting of hospital admissions because care managers relied on consumers’ self-reports. However, the nursing
facility admission data are completely accurate because
nursing facility admission prompts initiation of discharge
proceedings from the PASSPORT program.
Study changes suggested by this pilot will be incorporated
into the authors’ proposal for funding of a fully powered
trial.
