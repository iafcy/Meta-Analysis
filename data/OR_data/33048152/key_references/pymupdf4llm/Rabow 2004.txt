## The Comprehensive Care Team

### A Controlled Trial of Outpatient Palliative Medicine Consultation

_Michael W. Rabow, MD; Suzanne L. Dibble, DNSc, RN; Steven Z. Pantilat, MD; Stephen J. McPhee, MD_


**Background: Little is known about the use of pallia-**
tive care for outpatients who continue to pursue treatment of their underlying disease or whether outpatient
palliative medicine consultation teams improve clinical
outcomes.

**Methods: We conducted a year-long controlled trial in-**
volving 50 intervention patients and 40 control patients
in a general medicine outpatient clinic. Primary care physicians referred patients with advanced congestive heart
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer
who had a prognosis ranging from 1 to 5 years. In the interventiongroup,theprimarycarephysiciansreceivedmultiple palliative care team consultations, and patients received advance care planning, psychosocial support, and
family caregiver training. Clinical and health care utilization outcomes were assessed at 6 and 12 months.

**Results: Groups were similar at baseline. Similar num-**
bers of patients died during the study year (P =.63). Af

ter the intervention, intervention group patients had less
dyspnea (P=.01) and anxiety (P=.05) and improved sleep
quality (P =.05) and spiritual well-being (P =.007), but
no change in pain (P =.41), depression (P =.28), quality
of life (P=.43), or satisfaction with care (P=.26). Few patients received recommended analgesic or antidepressant medications. Intervention patients had decreased primary care (P=.03) and urgent care visits (P=.04) without
an increase in emergency department visits, specialty clinic
visits, hospitalizations, or number of days in the hospital. There were no differences in charges (P =.80).

**Conclusions: Consultation by a palliative medicine team**
led to improved patient outcomes in dyspnea, anxiety,
and spiritual well-being, but failed to improve pain or
depression. Palliative care for seriously ill outpatients can
be effective, but barriers to implementation must be explored.

Most Americans, however, die of
chronic illnesses without predictable prognoses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and congestive
heart failure (CHF),[9,10] often after suffering with significant symptoms.[11,12] The
transition model of hospice care does not
serve these patients well, as most do not
want to choose between curative treatment and symptom relief.[5,11,13-15] A broader
model of palliative medicine would offer
aggressive symptom management and
comprehensive care to the large percentage of outpatients with advanced illness
who are still pursuing aggressive management or cure of their disease.[16,17] Such outpatient palliative medicine has received
little rigorous evaluation but may become increasingly relevant as the number of elderly people living with serious
chronic illness increases.[18-23]

intervention in which an interdisciplinary team offered palliative medicine con

lies, and their primary care physicians (PCPs), in addition
to usual primary care. In general, these patients were engaged in aggressive attempts to cure or manage disease
and not necessarily considered to be at the end of life.


**METHODS**


We compared physical, psychological, social, and spiritual outcomes between an intervention group of patients receiving a
multifaceted, outpatient, palliative medicine consultation intervention plus usual primary care and a control group receiving only usual primary care.[24]

**SETTING**

The study was performed within the 70-physician general medicine practice of a tertiary care, university medical center located in a large urban setting and serving an ethnically diverse
population. Patients are cared for by academic faculty and house
staff, and generally are insured via Medicare or managed care
organizations, with a minority of Medicaid or self-pay patients. For administrative purposes, patients and physicians of
the general medical practice are divided into 2 equivalent modules (GMA and GMB) housed in the same building, but with
separate waiting areas and nursing and clerical staff.
On the basis of a coin flip, patients in one clinic module
(GMA) were assigned to be the intervention group and patients in the second module (GMB) were assigned to the control group. Although individual patients were not randomized
to the intervention, each patient’s initial assignment to the practice modules was based only on appointment and space availability at the time of enrollment, with no other differences in
composition. Similarly, physicians are initially assigned to 1 of
the 2 practice modules solely on the basis of space availability
in the practice at the time of hiring. Physicians and patients
assigned to one module did not cross over to the other; physicians in the control module did not care for any patients in
the intervention group and thus received no education or support from the intervention team.

**SUBJECTS**

We invited physicians in both practice modules to refer adult
patients with diagnoses of cancer, advanced COPD, or advanced CHF, whom they believed had a life expectancy of 1 to 5
years and who were not yet ready for hospice care. To assist PCP
recall of potentially eligible patients, we provided physicians with
lists of all patients they had seen in the previous 3 months, as
well as patients identified by computerized medical record or billing data as having one of the relevant diagnoses. We invited all
eligible patients referred by their PCP to participate. We excluded patients with nonmelanoma skin cancers, dementia, or
psychosis; those enrolled in hospice care; and those unable to
complete a written survey in English or Spanish. The PCPs and
patients were informed that GMA was assigned to the intervention arm and GMB to the control arm. Because they received no
direct benefit from the study, control patients received participation incentives with grocery store gift certificates.

**THE COMPREHENSIVE CARE TEAM INTERVENTION**

We provided all intervention patients with a newly developed
1-year program delivered by an interdisciplinary palliative medicine team called the Comprehensive Care Team (CCT).[24] The
CCT was composed of a social worker, nurse, chaplain, pharmacist, psychologist, art therapist, volunteer coordinator, and
3 physicians who addressed physical, emotional, and spiritual


, p,
had expertise in palliative care. The program integrated PCP
consultation, case management, volunteer and group support,
chaplaincy consultation, and artistic expression.[25-34]
The CCT intervention included 7 main components. First,
consultation with PCPs was based on in-depth and follow-up
patient assessments conducted by the social worker. Assessments were presented to the entire CCT at regularly scheduled team meetings directed by one of the CCT physicians. The
PCPs did not attend these CCT meetings but often had informal discussions with the CCT social worker and physicians.
At 3 points (study entry, midway, and study completion), the
CCT developed recommendations that were offered to the patient’s PCP via a written letter and e-mail. Recommendations
were offered in the following 5 domains: physical symptoms,
psychological well-being, social support, spiritual well-being,
and advance care planning. The CCT physicians based their
suggestions on information from validated patient surveys and
the social worker assessment, but rarely directly interviewed
or examined the patient.
Second, the social worker provided case management and
offered psychological support in person and by telephone. The
social worker also encouraged patients to address issues of advance care planning, including surrogate decision makers, prognosis, funeral arrangements, and wills.
Third,anurseprovidedfamilycaregivertrainingandsupport
through formal classes and informal individual consultation.
Fourth, a pharmacist performed a medical chart review of
patient medications, looking in particular for drug-drug interactions and unnecessarily complex medication regimens.
Fifth, a chaplain offered each patient spiritual and psychological support.
Sixth, patients and their families were invited to monthly
support groups that included discussions about symptom management and advance care planning, as well as art projects called
“art experientials” (available at: http://dgim.ucsf.edu/cct
/what_art_exp.htm) designed to explore emotions relating to
illness and relationships.
Seventh, medical and pharmacy students provided volunteer patient support and advocacy through weekly telephone
contacts with patients, monthly visits, and regular communication with the CCT about patient needs.[35]

**DATA COLLECTION METHODS**

After obtaining study approval from the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research and written informed consent from participating patients, we collected data from written patient surveys, retrospective review
of the medical center’s computerized medical and billing
records, and exit interviews with intervention patients.

**Questionnaire Data**

At study enrollment (time 1), 6 months (time 2), and 12 months
(time 3), we collected data via a written questionnaire on functional status and multiple study outcomes (dyspnea, pain, sleep,
anxiety, depression, spiritual well-being, quality of life, health
care satisfaction, and advance care planning). A member of the
CCT clinical team (for intervention patients) or research staff
(for controls) brought the survey to the study subject at home
or during a clinic visit and supervised its completion. The survey was a compilation of previously validated instruments, as
detailed below.

**Physical Functioning and Symptoms. The Rapid Disability Rat-**
ing Scale-2[36] provided a measure of patient functional status,
with 18 items using a 4-point Likert scale. Scores can range from

sured using the University of California, San Diego Shortness
of Breath Questionnaire.[37] This instrument, consisting of 2 subscales scored on a 5-point Likert scale, was developed for patients with moderate-to-severe lung disease, and assesses dyspnea during an average day during the past week. The first 21item subscale measures the degree to which dyspnea interferes
with various daily activities. The second 3-item subscale assesses the degree to which dyspnea limits daily life. Pain was
assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory,[38] which evaluates worst,
least, average, and current pain during the last 24 hours, using
a scale of 0 to 10. We also asked respondents to list current
pain medications and treatments. Sleep quantity and quality
were assessed using 6 sleep items from the Medical Outcomes
Study.[39] Sleep was assessed during the preceding 4 weeks and
was scored on a 6-point Likert scale, with a higher score indicating better sleep.

**Psychosocial and Spiritual Well-being. Anxiety was assessed**
using the 6-item anxiety scale from the well-validated, 5-point
Likert scale Profile of Mood States.[40] Depressive symptoms were
evaluated using the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale.[41] Higher overall scores indicate greater
depressive symptoms, with a cutoff score of 16 or greater identifying cases of depression. Spiritual well-being was evaluated
using the 20-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale,[42] which includes
an existential and a religious subscale. Quality of life was assessed using the Multidimensional Quality of Life Scale–
Cancer Version,[43] a 17-item, sex-specific instrument with an
11-point Likert scale. Health care satisfaction was assessed with
25 relevant items from the Group Health Association of America
Consumer Satisfaction Survey.[44] This instrument uses a 5-point
Likert scale, with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction.

**Advance Care Planning. The questionnaire also asked pa-**
tients whether they had completed or considered a durable power
of attorney for health care, funeral plans, and plans for disposition of possessions after death. Patients responded with yes
or no answers.
We pretested the questionnaire with patients meeting inclusion criteria in a different general medicine practice. The questionnaire was then translated into Spanish and backtranslated to ensure lexical equivalency by a professional
bilingual medical researcher. High standardized � coefficients
(range, 0.75-0.98) provided evidence of good reliability of the
individual survey instruments in this study population. Patients could elect to complete the questionnaire in English or
Spanish only; 1 patient chose the Spanish instrument. The questionnaire required approximately 1 hour to complete.

**Medical Record Data**

The medical center’s computerized medical record identifies
all office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. This electronic record lists medical problems and medications prescribed, as entered in the written medical record by
treating physicians. At study completion, a trained research assistant, masked to patients’ intervention versus control group
assignment, reviewed the computerized medical records of all
study subjects during the study period. Visits to the general medicine clinic, specialty clinics, urgent care clinic, and emergency
department were tabulated. In addition, the numbers of hospitalizations and days hospitalized were calculated. Finally, we
recorded the analgesic and antidepressant medications documented on the computerized medication list at study entry or
added during the study period.
Although analysis of cost data is preferable, we were able
only to acquire data on charges using the medical center’s com

p g y y p,
search assistant reviewed the computerized billing record and
identified all charges for office visits, emergency department
visits, and hospital stays for all study participants during the
study period. Medication, out-of-pocket, and outside hospitalization charges were not obtained.

**Exit Interview Data**

Intervention patients completing the 1-year intervention participated in a semistructured exit interview with the CCT social worker. Patients were asked about the timing of their introduction to the CCT, their level of satisfaction with the various
elements of the CCT intervention, and the effect of the CCT
on their relationships with their family, their PCP, and the medical center. Patients were asked to provide yes or no responses
and then, if they wished, to answer in greater detail. Finally,
we obtained information about the location and setting of a patient’s death from their PCP.

**ANALYTIC METHODS**

We analyzed data from patients who completed all 3 surveys.
All data were double entered and analyzed using the CRUNCH
statistical program.[45]
We addressed 2 questions for each clinical outcome using the analysis of covariance statistic. We first determined
whether there were significant group differences in mean outcome scores over time. Then, to account for the possibility that
similar group means might be found only because outcomes
improved over time for one group while worsening for the other,
we conducted analyses of group�time interactions. To control for baseline group differences, we controlled for the time
1 values by entering them as covariates in the analysis of covariance equation. The adjusted means presented herein account for the influence of the time 1 values. All medical center
charges for each patient during the study period were summed,
and intervention and control group means were calculated. For
advance care planning, utilization, and charge data, we used
the t test statistic to compare group means. A cutoff of P�.05
determined statistical significance. From the exit interviews,
we tabulated the discrete responses.

**SAMPLE-SIZE AND POWER CALCULATIONS**

A power calculation based on baseline pain scores among all
study participants indicated a greater than 90% power (�=.05)
to detect a 10% change in average pain score on a 0- to 10point scale for a sample size of 50 in each group.


The GMA and GMB physicians referred a similar number of patients (164 and 166, respectively), and a similar number of these patients met eligibility criteria (118
in the GMA and 113 in the GMB). Fifty intervention patients and 40 control patients were enrolled. Among eligible patients, 57.6% of referred intervention patients and
64.6% of referred control patients refused to enroll in the
study. Being too ill was the most frequently given explanation for refusal to participate by patients in both groups.
The mean age of study participants (N=90) was 68.6
years. Most were women (64%), white (53%), US citizens (69%), living with someone (57%), unmarried (73%),
and retired (62%). Mean education level was 13.5 years
(Table 1). Patients in the control (n=40) and interven

**BASELINE OUTCOME MEASURES**

There were no significant baseline group differences in
physical symptoms, psychological well-being, spiritual
well-being, satisfaction, or advance care planning measures (Table 2).

**USE OF CCT SERVICES**

Among intervention patients who completed the study,
24 patients (69%) would have liked to receive CCT services earlier in the course of their illness. No patient reported a wish to defer receiving CCT services until later
in their illness.
In addition to the 3 formal assessments, the social
worker provided each intervention patient an average of
3.8 in-person and 13.0 telephone contacts during the year.
The social worker contacted each patient’s PCP an average of 1.6 times and contacted each patient’s family caregivers an average of 2.8 times. As a result of CCT case
management, 37 patients (74%) received new durable

Of the 10 hospitalizations of CCT patients, the CCT
was aware of 9. Hospitalized patients received at least 1
hospital visit from a team member, with a mean number
of visits of 2.2 per patient. In all cases, the CCT provided information to the inpatient physicians about clinical issues or previous advance care planning decisions.
Family members of 16 (62%) of the 26 intervention
patients with identified family caregivers attended at least

**INTERVENTION OUTCOMES**

**Physical Symptoms**

After controlling for the presence of dyspnea at baseline, the odds of a patient reporting any dyspnea at time
3 were significantly less for the intervention group (odds
ratio, 6.07; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-35.56). Inter

vention patients reported significantly less dyspnea interfering with daily activities (F=7.06; P=.01) (Table 3).
There was a significant group�time interaction with decreased limitation of activity due to dyspnea for the intervention patients but increased limitation over time for
control patients (F=6.83; P =.01).
After controlling for pain at baseline, there were no
statistically significant differences between groups or
group�time interactions for any of the pain items (Table
3). The CCT made opioid and nonopioid pain management recommendations to PCPs in 23 cases (46%). However, in 21 of these cases (91%), no documentation that
the PCP followed the recommendation could be found
in the computerized medical record. The PCPs initiated
a recommended opioid for only 1 (8%) of 13 patients.
Although the electronic record generally does not document physician recommendations that are refused by patients, nonadherence with opioid recommendations was
rare (reported by only 1 [8%] of 12 patients to whom opioids were newly prescribed).
After controlling for baseline differences, there was
a statistically significant improvement in sleep quality in
the intervention group (F=4.05; P =.05) (Table 3). No
statistically significant differences in sleep quantity or
group� time interactions emerged.

**Psychosocial and Spiritual Well-being**

After controlling for anxiety at baseline, there was no statistically significant group difference in mean anxiety
(P=.68) (Table 4). However, anxiety scores for the intervention patients improved from times 2 to 3 (mean
scores, 6.8 to 5.3), whereas those for the control patients
worsened (mean scores, 5.5 to 5.9). This group�time interaction was statistically significant (P=.05).
After controlling for baseline depression scores, there
were no significant differences between groups or sig

nificant group� time interactions (Table 4). For the 23
intervention patients with Center for Epidemiological
Studies Depression Scale scores of at least 16 (46%), the
CCT recommended antidepressant prescriptions (18 patients) or an increase in the dosage of a current antidepressant prescription (5 patients). The computerized
medical record documented that an antidepressant was
newly prescribed during the study period for only 3 (17%)
of the 18 patients. Two patients with high Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale scores refused to
consider treatment with antidepressants; however, only
2 (11%) of 18 intervention patients with existing prescriptions reported nonadherence.
After controlling for baseline spiritual well-being,
intervention group patients reported higher overall spiritual well-being than controls (F=8.21; P=.007) (Table
4). From times 2 to 3, the intervention group reported
improved spiritual well-being (mean scores, 98.0 to
105.5), whereas the control group was unchanged
(mean scores, 91.2 to 92.4). This group�time interaction was statistically significant (F=4.24; P =.05).
Patients in the intervention group also scored higher on
the religious subscale (F=14.01; P =.001). However,
there were no group differences in scores or any significant group � time interactions on the existential subscale.
After controlling for baseline values, there were no
significant quality-of-life score differences over time between groups and no statistically significant group�time
interactions (Table 4).
After controlling for baseline values, there were no
significant group differences or group � time interactions in health care satisfaction scores (Table 4). However, during exit interviews, intervention patients reported that the CCT improved their level of connection
and satisfaction with family (30 respondents [86%]), PCPs


(28 respondents [80%]), and the medical center (23 respondents [66%]).

**Advance Care Planning**

For the 22 intervention patients and 18 controls who had
not already completed a durable power of attorney for
health care at baseline, 12 intervention patients (55%)
and 5 controls (28%) had completed one by time 3
(P =.12). For the 23 intervention patients and 19 controls who had not completed funeral arrangements at baseline, 8 intervention patients (35%) and 1 control (5%)
had completed their arrangements by time 3, a statistically significant difference (P=.03). For the 20 intervention patients and 11 controls who had not completed plans
for disposition of their possessions at baseline, 16 intervention patients (80%) and 5 controls (46%) had made
plans by time 3 (P =.11). In exit interviews, 23 intervention patients (66%) expressed appreciation for the opportunity to discuss these and other elements of advance care planning with the CCT.

**HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND CHARGES**

On average during the study period, intervention patients made fewer visits to their PCP (mean, 7.5 vs 10.6;
_P_ =.03) and fewer urgent care clinic visits (mean, 0.3 vs
0.6; P =.03) (Table 5). There were no statistically significant group differences with regard to specialty clinic
visits (mean, 4.9 vs 7.0; P =.25), emergency department
visits (mean, 1.6 vs 1.7; P =.81), number of hospitalizations (mean, 1.2 vs 0.8; P =.21), or number of days hospitalized (mean, 6.3 vs 4.3; P =.38).
Among the 10 intervention patients who died during the study period, 5 died at home or in a nursing home,
2 died in the hospital, and 3 died in hospice care (home,

The mean charge per patient for all medical center

**COMMENT**


Our findings corroborate that patients with cancer,
advanced CHF, or advanced COPD suffer significant
symptoms as they near the end of life.[11,12,46] The CCT
improved some, although not all, of the outcomes we
examined. We found improvements in the physical
(dyspnea and sleep), psychological (anxiety), spiritual
(spiritual well-being), and advance care planning (funeral planning) domains. In addition, patients with
access to CCT services made fewer primary care and
urgent care visits, without an associated increase in specialty clinic visits, emergency department visits, number
of hospitalizations, or number of days hospitalized.
There were no significant group differences in medical
center charges.
Study results indicate that CCT patients did not have
improvements in pain, depression, or quality of life. A
likely and unfortunate explanation for this finding is that
the CCT’s pain and depression recommendations were
rarely implemented. Without appropriate treatment to
relieve pain and depression, improving quality of life may
be impossible.[47,48] Our research methods could not detect instances in which PCPs may have made medication recommendations that were refused by patients. However, exit interviews with intervention patients revealed
that only 2 refused antidepressant medication and none


refused pain medications. These findings suggest that
PCPs ignored important advice and are consistent with
previous studies documenting PCP reluctance to treat pain
and depression as a barrier to good care.[11,46,49-53] It is also
possible that PCPs did not follow CCT recommendations because patients underwent assessment by a social
worker with physician review, rather than direct examination by a physician. However, the CCT consultation
letter to PCPs was written and signed by a physician.
Overall, the CCT was most effective in improving
outcomes that the team could influence directly, via provision of services, education, and support. Although
supplemental oxygen therapy was frequently recommended, even dyspnea may have improved because of
CCT attention to patients’ anxiety and fear about shortness of breath.[54,55] The CCT had little effect on outcomes that required action by PCPs, reflecting a limitation of consultation services in general.[1,56] Outpatient
palliative medicine teams might have greater efficacy if
they are able to directly implement recommendations
within clearly defined limits agreed to by the PCP.
There was no significant difference in mortality or
location of death between the groups, or any evidence
that intervention patients enrolled in hospice care more
frequently. In general, these outpatients with advanced
illness received palliation of symptoms while pursuing
aggressive treatment of their disease.
Our findings have several limitations. First, participants were not individually randomized. However, nearly
all baseline characteristics in the 2 groups were similar.
Rather than randomize patients within a single practice,
2 similar but separate subpopulations of patients and physicians were randomly assigned to the intervention and
control arms (ie, those in 2 discrete practice modules).
We chose this design to eliminate the contamination that
would have occurred if physicians had cared for both intervention and control patients. Because physicians of patients in the intervention group did not simultaneously
care for control patients, we decreased the risk for con

rectly receive the influence of CCT consultations and physician education.
Second, although well matched at baseline along
most sociodemographic, functional, disease severity, and
outcome measurements, the intervention group had more
women. It is not clear, however, that improvement in dyspnea, anxiety, or spiritual well-being is more likely in
women than men, so this difference is unlikely to confound our results, particularly since we controlled for baseline outcome values.
Third, exit interviews may have been limited by acquiescence bias. Patients may have inflated positive feedback about the CCT because of their relationship with
the interviewing social worker. However, the fact that only
some outcomes were improved argues against more than
a minor contribution of this bias to our results. In addition, exit interviews were conducted only with patients
completing the intervention. It is possible that patients
who failed to complete the study might have felt differently about their CCT experience. However, available information suggests that those who did not complete the
study were similar to those who did.
Fourth, the sample studied here was small, allowing for the possibility of type II errors. However, our a
priori power calculation showed that our sample size was
sufficient to detect a clinically meaningful difference in
pain scores. In addition, despite statistically significant
differences in survey scores, some findings (such as sleep
quality differences) may not be clinically meaningful or
have only a small effect size. However, in the cases of anxiety and dyspnea, not only were the differences clinically
meaningful, but the intervention group improved while
the control group worsened. We also consider the spiritual well-being and advance care planning differences observed to be clinically significant.
Fifth, our study collected basic charge data only and
did not include a formal cost-benefit analysis. Decreased primary care and urgent care visits were not accompanied by increased utilization of other medical center services, but this decrease in clinic visits was not large
enough to result in a statistically significant difference
in overall charges between groups. Data on medication,
out-of-pocket, and outside hospitalization charges were
not collected; however, little care was received outside
the medical center by these patients. Precise intervention costs were impossible to extract for a formal costbenefit analysis, as research and clinical intervention costs
were enmeshed in this study. However, we estimate the
cost of the intervention to be modest, consisting primarily of part-time social worker effort.[24] Now that we have
some evidence of intervention efficacy, future research
should assess the real costs of the intervention. Such an
assessment would need to include careful accounting of
the costs of all personnel time and activities (including
patient care, chart review, team meeting, PCP communication, and administrative time), medications, intervention administration, medical equipment and supplies, and patient out-of-pocket expenses.
Finally, even for the benefits shown, the results may
not be generalizable to patients with diseases other than
CHF, COPD, or cancer, or to patients in different clini

g, g p yp
with chronic medical conditions. Also, because of the relatively large number of eligible patients refusing to enroll, the results may not apply to the population of patients with these diseases who are unable to participate
or uninterested in participating in such an intervention.
However, the study refusal rate was similar in the intervention and control groups, and both groups offered similar reasons for refusing to participate.
Nonetheless, our results justify a larger, randomized controlled trial, including methods to increase PCP
adherence to recommendations, or perhaps a comanagement model in which the CCT physicians can prescribe
medications for patients, as is the case for other subspecialty consultations. Future studies should determine (1)
which specific elements of the service actually led to the
identified improvements, (2) the cost-effectiveness of such
interventions, and (3) whether even earlier palliative medicine intervention would offer similar benefits.
The CCT trial demonstrated that a palliative medicine consultation service for outpatients can improve patient outcomes in the domains where it has a direct impact on patient care. Greater benefits could be achieved
if consultants assumed earlier and more direct management of palliative care issues, including prescribing appropriate medications. Ultimately, we must attend to the
needs of our aging population in which an increasing
number of people are living fully even as they near the
end of life. Patients with advanced chronic illness clearly
desire palliative care, even as they pursue treatment of
disease. However, since one fifth of the study patients died
during the intervention year, physicians may have less
time than they think to provide it.
