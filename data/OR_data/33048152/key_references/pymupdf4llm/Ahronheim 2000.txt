 ABSTRACT

 Background: Few patients with end-stage dementia are enrolled in hospice care. A palliative care approach would nonetheless seem to be appropriate in various care settings, including the acute care hospital.
 Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of palliative care in patients with ad- vanced dementia (Functional Assessment Staging Tool [FAST] stage 6d-7f) who were hospi- talized with acute illness. Intervention patients received recommendations by a palliative care team with the goal of enhancing patient comfort; control patients received usual care with- out these recommendations.
 Results: Among 99 patients enrolled over 3 years, groups were comparable at baseline in terms of gender, age, race, dementia stage, and advance directive status. Outcomes were sim- ilar in terms of mean number of hospitalizations, average length of stay, and mortality. In- tervention patients were more likely than control patients to receive a palliative care plan
**(23% versus 4%; p = 0.008), usually on discharge, and more decisions were made to forgo cer-**
#### tain medical treatments but the numbers were small. Fewer patients in the intervention group received intravenous therapy throughout the admission (66% vs. 81%, p = 0.025). Overall, ad- ditional interventions included daily phlebotomy for at least half of the admission (41%), sys- temic antibiotics (75%), and new feeding tubes (44%). Including tubes present at the time of randomization, a total of 69% received long-term enteral feeding.
 Conclusion: It was difficult for a palliative care research team to influence the care of ad- vanced dementia patients in the acute hospital setting. When patients have advanced de- mentia, there may be unique barriers, including perceived prognostic uncertainty, difficulty assessing comfort level, and perceptions about tube feeding. There must be a reexamination of treatment approaches for this severely impaired group of patients. Further study should attempt to identify patients prior to the need for acute hospitalization so goals can be estab- lished when there is less urgency to make life and death decisions.
