**Abstract**
**_Background: Despite their poor prognosis, patients with se-_**

hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions during their
last year of life. Objectives: To determine the feasibility of a
home palliative care intervention during 1 year versus usual
care, and the possible impact of this intervention on emergency, hospital and ICU admissions, survival, mood, and
health-related quality of life (HRQL). Methods: Prospective
controlled study of patients with severe COPD (GOLD stage
III or IV) and long-term oxygen therapy and/or home nonin

vasive ventilation and/or one or more hospital admissions in
the previous year for acute exacerbation, randomized to
usual care versus usual care with add-on monthly intervention by palliative care specialists at home for 12 months. Re**_sults: Of 315 patients screened, 49 (15.5%) were randomized_**

**Introduction**

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
progressive lung disorder leading to chronic respiratory
failure, respiratory distress, and recurrent hospitalizations for acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Mortality rates
of 30–50% have been reported within 2 years following
hospital admission for acute exacerbations [1–4]. An estimated 30% of COPD patients hospitalized for the first
time are re-admitted within 3 months. While medical
treatment may partially relieve symptoms and noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and oxygen therapy may prolong
life [5], for patients with severe COPD, both quality of life
and survival are poor [6–8]. In spite of this, COPD patients are much less likely to receive palliative care than
patients with lung cancer [9–14]. In fact, COPD patients
have limited access to specialists in palliative care [15, 16]
and very few palliative care intervention studies are available for this population [17, 18].
The “SUPPORT” study demonstrated that COPD patients, when compared to patients with lung cancer, were
much more likely to die in the intensive care unit (ICU),
on mechanical ventilation and with dyspnea [19, 20].
These differences occurred although most patients with
COPD preferred treatment focused on comfort rather
than on prolonging life. In fact, “SUPPORT” found that
patients with lung cancer and COPD were equally likely
to prefer not being intubated, and not receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), yet patients with COPD
were much more likely to receive these therapies.
Because of these observations, advance care planning
(ACP) should be especially appropriate among patients
with COPD: their unpredictable trajectory of illness and
exacerbations may make these patients suddenly critically ill. However, only a minority of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD have discussed treatment preferences and end-of-life care issues with their physicians [21,
22]. In fact, most COPD patients believe that their physicians do not know their preferences for end-of-life care.
Severe COPD also represents a substantial and prolonged
burden in terms of care, with often a poor control of
symptoms and emotional disorders.
The aim of this pilot prospective randomized study
was to evaluate the feasibility and possible impact of an


early palliative care intervention at home in severe and
very severe COPD patients over a 1-year period. Because
admissions to emergency wards, hospitalizations and admissions to ICUs are distressing experiences for these patients, and represent a substantial financial burden, we
defined these items as major endpoints of our intervention. We added a detailed evaluation of symptoms, healthrelated quality of life (HRQL), and mood disturbances as
secondary endpoints. Our hypotheses were that patients
would accept and benefit from a palliative care intervention and that, through improved understanding of their
disease and symptom management, and promotion of
ACP, requirements for in-hospital acute care would decrease.

**Patients and Methods**


Patients were recruited among subjects followed by Geneva
University Hospitals on long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) and/or
home NIV, and subjects hospitalized for AECOPD in our general
internal medicine and geriatric wards.
Details of the study protocol have previously been published

[23]. Briefly, inclusion criteria were: COPD defined according to
GOLD (Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Diseases; www.
goldcopd.org) criteria (FEV1/FVC <70%) stage III or IV (FEV1
<50% predicted) and LTOT and/or home NIV and/or one or more
hospital admissions in the previous year for an acute exacerbation.
Exclusion criteria were: moderate or severe cognitive impairment
(Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE] score <23) and cancer.
After providing written informed consent and filling in baseline measurements, patients were randomly assigned to the early
palliative care group (EPC) or the standard care group (SC) in a
1:1 ratio without stratification and with randomized block sizes
ranging from 4 to 6, using sealed envelopes prepared with a computer program by F.R.H., a co-investigator not involved in the inclusion of the patients.

_Intervention_
Patients assigned to the EPC group met our community ambulatory palliative care team as soon as possible after inclusion and
monthly thereafter for 12 months. Home visits by nurses from the
palliative care consultation lasted approximately 90 min and focused on:

−− _Symptom assessment and_ _management using the Edmonton_
Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) [22, 23]. If intensity of
pain, dyspnea, mood, anxiety, and appetite were >4/10 and the
patient agreed, a consultation with a palliative care physician
(or other specialist) was suggested
−− _Nutrition (Mini Nutritional Assessment Scale) [24]_

−− _Understanding of illness and coping: information about COPD_
was provided through patient education, and use of brochures
on activities of daily living [25]; management of acute and
chronic dyspnea were discussed as well as use of morphine
−− _Anticipation, decision-making: completion of ACP was system-_
atically discussed and encouraged

sages
All cases were discussed with a physician specialized in palliative care, whom the patient could consult whenever appropriate.
The palliative care team could be reached between visits if requested.

_Control Group_
Patients randomized to the SC group had no contact with the
palliative care team. Both groups received standard care throughout the study period. For all patients under LTOT and/or home
NIV, specialized nurses provided regular home visits to check on
all aspects related to respiratory support. Treatments prescribed by
a primary care physician or pulmonologist (chest therapy, physiotherapy, other aspects of home care) were not modified. Health
care workers following the control group were not informed of the
content of the “palliative care” intervention. Because the palliative
care team was distinct from those providing standard care, the risk

COPD


of “contamination” of the control group by the early palliative care
intervention was minimal.
For both groups, a research nurse (independent from the palliative care team) performed a standardized evaluation including:

−At inclusion: basic sociodemographic data, MMSE, spirome-−
try, use of oxygen or NIV, history of recent exacerbations (<3
months), prior admissions to the emergency ward, hospital,
ICU, medication, network of health care workers and informal
support (family), ACP
−Every month: data related to primary outcomes (hospital, −
emergency ward and ICU admissions) recorded through hospital files, contact with the patient and his/her GP
−Every 3 months: data related to primary outcomes; COPD as-−
sessment test (CAT) [26]; Hospital Anxiety and Depression
scale (HAD) [27]; SF-36 HRQL scale [28]
This agenda was followed for 12 months. A final questionnaire
(focused on satisfaction with and acceptability of the intervention)
was submitted to all patients 6 months after the end of the intervention.
All data were anonymized and recorded on Secutrial software,
and, at the end of data collection, transferred to our statistician
(F.R.H.) for analysis. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT02223780).

_Statistical Analysis_
Group comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney
U test, Student’s t test, the Fisher exact or χ[2] tests, as appropriate.
Survival data and a composite variable (i.e., any admission to hospital for cardiac or respiratory causes or death) were compared
between groups using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests.
Scores which were filled in repeatedly (HAD, SF-36 scores and
subscores) were analyzed using mixed linear regression with visit,
group and visit × group interaction as predictors, while taking into
account the exact date of the visit. Number of hospitalizations and
admissions were analyzed using incidence rate ratios computed
with Stata’s “iri” command. The Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple testing was applied for Table 3.
All statistical analyses were performed using the Stata software,
version 14.2.

**Results**


Among 315 patients screened over an 18-month period, 137 (43%) refused to participate; 28 patients (9%)
did not fulfill MMSE inclusion criteria (MMSE score
>23); 63 (20%) had either cancer or another comorbidity
limiting their short-term prognosis; 11 (3.4%) were in

cluded in another protocol; and 6 died rapidly during the
inclusion process (Fig. 1, flowchart). None of the patients
from the geriatric ward (n = 45) fulfilled MMSE inclusion
criteria. Fifty-one patients were finally included. Of these,
1 (EPC group) died before the first home visit by the palliative care nurse. Another patient declined pursuing the
study just after randomization when he learned that he
was allocated to the control group. Thus, 49 patients were
analyzed (26 in the EPC group and 23 in the SC group);
36 (73%) had been hospitalized during the previous year;
all were GOLD stage III or IV, group D. Eight (16%) patients had died at the end of the study (1 in the ICU, 2 at
home, and 5 in hospital wards).
Sociodemographic and functional data at inclusion are
summarized in Tables 1 and 2, and in the online supplement (see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000495312 for
all online suppl. material). For all items provided, the randomization process performed well, and there were no
significant differences between groups for sociodemographic, anthropometric, functional and subjective variables. This was also the case for hospital, emergency ward
and ICU admissions during the year prior to inclusion

(Table 3). Pulmonary function tests confirm the severe/
very severe obstructive syndrome related to COPD
(GOLD stage III or IV, group D criteria). Approximately
70% of all patients were either on LTOT, home NIV, or
both; 73.5% had been hospitalized within the year prior
to inclusion in our study for AECOPD. One third of patients were on antidepressant or anxiolytic medication,
and 16% were on opiates.

_Admissions to Emergency Wards, ICU, and_
_Hospitalizations_
As shown in Table 3, patients in the EPC group were
hospitalized for respiratory failure (IRR 1.87, 95% CI
1.04–3.48, p = 0.026) and admitted to the emergency ward
(IRR 2.05, 95% CI 1.11–3.94, _p = 0.014) twice as often_
during follow-up than the control group. However, after
the Benjamini and Hochberg correction for multiple testing, none of these differences was significant. Furthermore, when the same data are expressed as number of


events by patient, median values are identical in both
groups (hospitalization: median [IQR]: 0.0 [1; 2] vs. 1.5

[1; 4], p = 0.219; admissions to emergency wards: 1–0 [0;
3] vs. 1.0 [0; 4], p = 0.484). Figure 2 shows a Kaplan-Meier curve for a composite variable (admission to hospital
or death) for both groups. The log-rank test did not show
any significant difference between groups.
The use of antibiotics (for exacerbations not leading to
hospital admission) did not differ between groups during
the observation period (p = 0.819).

Average values at inclusion are provided in Table 2;
online supplementary Figures 3S–10S show longitudinal
follow-up of all subscores of the SF-36. Each figure shows

At inclusion, 3 patients in each group had completed
their ACP directives (p = 1.000). At the end of the study,
9 patients (35%) of the EPC group versus 3 (13%) of the

There was therefore a significant difference in the number of patients who wrote their ACP directives in favor of
the EPC group (p = 0.023).

curred, 4 in each group. Survival did not differ between
groups (log-rank test, p = 0.913).

_Appreciation of Intervention Questionnaire_
Six months after the end of the intervention, patients
of the EPC group were asked if they had appreciated the
home visits of the specialized nurse (18 responses, 17 approved), and whether the monthly visits of the specialized
nurse had impacted on their quality of life (9, i.e. 50% approved, 6 did not know, 3 disagreed).


**Discussion**

To our knowledge, this pilot study is the first prospective randomized study of an early palliative care intervention at home, over a 1-year period, in severe COPD patients, most of whom were on LTOT, home NIV, or both.
Patients were very symptomatic, with high CAT scores,
markedly impaired HRQL (SF-36), and high levels of
anxiety and depression. Palliative intervention was based
on monthly interventions at home with a holistic approach. The study showed that recruitment in the tar

geted population was a major problem. As a result of this,
data presented are underpowered to exclude any effect of
the palliative care intervention. The intervention was feasible, as well as the evaluations performed of the use of
health resources, HRQL, and emotional disorders. Data
show a trend for a higher rate of hospital and ICU admissions for respiratory causes in the intervention group,
which loses statistical significance when expressed as
number of events per patient. Mood, HRQL, and CAT
scores did not differ significantly between groups initially or during follow-up. However, more patients completed ACP directives in the intervention group.
Defining “early” intervention for palliative care is arbitrary [31]. We chose patients with LTOT and/or NIV
and or hospitalized within the preceding year. Patients
hospitalized for AECOPD are at high risk of subsequent
readmission or post-discharge mortality; those under
LTOT and/or home NIV also have a limited survival, justifying the chosen criteria. Other items such as FEV1
<30% predicted, oxygen dependence, AECOPD in the
previous year, comorbidities, decreased functional status
are also helpful to identify high-risk subjects and should
trigger discussions on ACP and end-of-life care [31].
However, the interindividual variability of the clinical
course of COPD is a problem: even indices such as the
BODE or ADO are poor predictors of mortality for a given individual [32, 33]. Tools such as the ProPal-COPD
require further validation but seem promising for selecting patients at high risk of 1-year mortality [34].
Recruiting patients for this study proved to be very difficult: although screening was prolonged, extended to another hospital and to all pulmonary physicians in our
area, we did not reach the target number of cases and only
15% of the targeted population was finally included. Several factors explain these difficulties. First, we realized
that palliative care was perceived as frightening for many
patients and negatively associated with end-of-life care.
Although the study was presented as focusing on improving symptom control, we were transparent as to the nurses’ training, and did not dissimulate their identity as palliative care specialists. There is clearly a negative connotation to “palliative care,” which had an unfavorable impact
on study acceptance, despite the detailed explanations
provided. To avoid this, integrating palliative care into
usual care and developing a palliative care culture and
competence among the respiratory care team is an interesting option. Secondly, cognitive impairment was a
problem: none of the patients from the geriatric ward
could be included because of their low MMSE scores; a
nonquantified number of subjects with probable cogni

tive limitation were not included in the screening process;
in those formally screened, close to 10% had an MMSE
score <23. Excluding subjects with cognitive disorders
was mandatory for the reliability of questionnaires and
symptom scores included in the study protocol. Cognitive impairment is an underestimated and important
problem in this group of patients: a recent study showed
that less than 50% of severe COPD patients discussing
end-of-life options retained full comprehension of the
options after 24 h [35]. Several other groups have documented cognitive impairment in COPD under LTOT

[36–41]. Thirdly, comorbidities (cancer, severe cardiac
failure), and end-of-life were also limiting factors for inclusion. Finally, there was a high reluctance to participate
in our study based on concepts such as “fear of being a
guinea pig,” “uselessness of the study for their care,” or
refusal of randomization, even in patients followed by our
team. Further studies on this topic must anticipate these
difficulties.
The expected impact of the ECP group on hospital,
ICU and emergency ward admissions was not confirmed.
In fact, despite a similar rate of hospital admissions in
both groups during the year preceding this trial, there
were more admissions to both ICU and the emergency
wards in the ECP group during the observation period.
This trend was not significant when results are expressed
as number of events per patients. There is no obvious explanation for this finding. As mentioned, these findings
must take into account the limited number of subjects. It
shows, however, the need for quantifying the use of health
resources in future larger studies on this topic.
A positive finding was the increased number of ACP
in the EPC group. One of the goals of the intervention was
indeed to have patients understand the prognosis of their
disorder and the possible futility of aggressive end-of-life
managements. Very little data are available on ACP in
COPD; and available data show that ACP is surprisingly
uncommon in this population [42–45]. Paradoxically,
ACP obtained most often expressed the desire of CPR and
maximal treatment, patients failing to acknowledge their
prognosis and the natural history of their disease [46].
In previous studies of advanced COPD, and symptombased interventions, dyspnea has been a major focus [18].
Among medications prescribed for symptom control, in
spite of its documented efficacy, we noted a high reluctance expressed by patients to use oral morphine: only 4
patients in each group (16%) accepted opiates for improving control of dyspnea. Prescription of morphine did
not increase during the study period in spite of repeated
encouragement by the intervention group. Reluctance to


use morphine by physicians and patients is well described
in this setting [47].
Our results did not show any impact of early palliative
care on mood disturbances or HRQL. These results must
be put in perspective. (1) The number of subjects finally
included was under the level established to avoid a type II
error and thus the study was underpowered for a definite
conclusion. However, detailed analysis of mood (HAD),
HRQL (SF-36), and symptoms (CAT) (see online suppl.
Fig. 1S–11S) shows a remarkable similarity of results between both groups without the smallest trend favoring
the intervention. (2) The tools used to evaluate secondary
endpoints of the intervention may have been less responsive than disease-specific HRQL tools. We considered
that adding a disease-specific HRQL questionnaire would
be too time-consuming for study patients, who were already burdened by a very thorough assessment. (3) Modalities of the intervention could be questioned. However, the nurses implicated all had several years of experience in palliative care. Their interventions were directly
supervised by a palliative care physician, who discussed
all cases with the specialized nurses and defined medical
strategies whenever symptom scores were abnormal
(ESAS items >4). The intervention was comprehensive,
including regular symptom assessment and control, patient education, psychological support to patients and
caregivers, and alternative approaches such as relaxation,
reflexology, and massages. We therefore believe that the
intervention was appropriately designed. (4) Modalities
of usual care in these patients may have “diluted” the impact of the palliative care intervention: all patients under
LTOT and/or NIV in our area receive regular home visits
be specialized nurses; 37% of patients had home physiotherapy; 31% had home nurses for nonrespiratory treatments. One may therefore surmise that the implication of
several different health care workers may have limited the
benefit of the intervention. Indeed, among patients refusing to participate in the study, one of the reasons provided was the fear of too many health care workers invading
their privacy. (5) Finally, patient recruitment may have
influenced our results: the 15.6% of subjects included,
with a normal MMSE score, without significant comorbidities, accepting the idea of a clinical study, may have a
different resilience regarding their illness and may not
require the type of support provided.
Acknowledging these limitations, it is also possible
that this type of intervention is not in phase with the expectations of severe COPD patients. It is common knowledge that cancer has a poor prognosis, but prognosis of
COPD is unclear for patients, and information provided

by physicians is probably insufficient. Based on their understanding of their illness, ACP limiting access to ICU
or CPR for instance may not make sense for these patients. Severe COPD often have unreasonable expectations and tend to ignore or deny their prognosis. It is also
possible that EPC must target specific subgroups of severe
COPD: these patients have many different phenotypes
with different impacts on symptoms. Larger studies are
required to explore this possibility.
In summary, in this pilot study of patients with severe
COPD, most of whom were under LTOT and/or home
NIV, quality of life was markedly impaired, with considerable mood disturbance, and functional limitation. Recruitment proved to be a major barrier, with several possible explanations, many of which are related to the underlying pathology. A monthly home palliative care
intervention by specialized nurses for 1 year, completing
usual care, was feasible. The present study was underpowered to exclude a benefit from palliative care. Advance
directives were provided more often in the intervention
group. Because of the major impact of severe COPD on

HRQL, and on the use of health resources, further studies
are necessary and must be designed to take into account
the recruitment problems encountered, the frequency of
cognitive impairment and of comorbidities in this population, and possibly specific phenotypes for whom ECP
should be privileged.
