OBJECTIVES: To determine whether an in-home palliative care intervention for terminally ill patients can improve
patient satisfaction, reduce medical care costs, and increase
the proportion of patients dying at home.
DESIGN: A randomized, controlled trial.
SETTING: Two health maintenance organizations in two
states.
PARTICIPANTS: Homebound, terminally ill patients
(N 5 298) with a prognosis of approximately 1 year or less
to live plus one or more hospital or emergency department
visits in the previous 12 months.
INTERVENTION: Usual versus in-home palliative care
plus usual care delivered by an interdisciplinary team providing pain and symptom relief, patient and family education and training, and an array of medical and social
support services.
MEASUREMENTS: Measured outcomes were satisfaction with care, use of medical services, site of death, and
costs of care.
RESULTS: Patients randomized to in-home palliative care
reported greater improvement in satisfaction with care at
30 and 90 days after enrollment (Po.05) and were more
likely to die at home than those receiving usual care
(Po.001). In addition, in-home palliative care subjects were
less likely to visit the emergency department (P 5.01) or be
admitted to the hospital than those receiving usual care
(Po.001), resulting in significantly lower costs of care for
intervention patients (P 5.03).
CONCLUSION: In-home palliative care significantly increased patient satisfaction while reducing use of medical
services and costs of medical care at the end of life. This
study, although modest in scope, presents strong evidence

t has been widely recognized that our current medical
care structure is inadequate in meeting the needs of ter# I
minally ill patients and reducing the cost of care at the end
of life.[1] Despite the existence of hospice as a Medicare
benefit for nearly 2 decades, the program remains underused. Approximately 60% of all deaths occur in the hospital,[2] yet most patients express a preference to die at
home.[3–6] Although hospice programs aim to provide palliative services in the last 6 months of life, the median length
of stay in the program is 22 days, and 35% of patients die
within the first 7 days after hospice admission.[7] Hospice
patients with a short length of stay often require intensive
care to initiate the care plan, resulting in higher per diem
costs of care than for patients who receive longer periods of
stabilized, low-cost palliative care.[8,9] The low enrollment in
hospice services and the short length of time enrolled before
death attest to the need for end-of-life care programs that
address these access barriers. In addition, recent studies
have found that more end-of-life programs are needed to
provide alternatives to hospice that do not require forgoing
life-sustaining treatment.[10]

Although several studies have reported that end-of-life
care programs improve patient outcomes, these studies have
significant methodological weaknesses, limiting their generalizability.[11] Specifically, there has been a noticeable lack
of comprehensive empirical evidence confirming the clinical
benefits and demonstrating the cost effectiveness of these
models of care. The absence of rigorous research evaluating
the effectiveness of these programs has restricted the ability
and motivation of healthcare providers to replicate and
adopt these models as standard practice.
The purpose of this study was to test an in-home
palliative care model at two sites using a randomized,


-----

controlled design. Standard care was compared with standard care plus an in-home palliative care program to determine the program’s ability to improve patient outcomes
and reduce the costs of medical care at the end of life. Specifically, it was hypothesized that the palliative care program would increase patient satisfaction, reduce costs of
medical care, and increase the proportion of terminally ill
patients dying at home.

METHODS
This was a randomized, controlled trial conducted at two
separate managed care sites to test the replicability and the
effectiveness of an In-home Palliative Care (IHPC) program. Specific hypotheses tested for this study were that

� Late-stage patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), or cancer enrolled in the IHPC program will experience higher
satisfaction with care than patients receiving usual and
customary care (usual care).
� Medical costs will be lower for end-of-life patients enrolled in the IHPC program than for end-of-life patients
receiving usual care.

The settings for this trial were two group-model, closedpanel, non-profit health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) providing integrated healthcare services in Hawaii and Colorado. The Colorado site has more than 500
physicians representing all medical specialties and subspecialties in 16 separate ambulatory medical offices spread
across a greater metropolitan area. The HMO contracts
with outside providers for emergency department, hospital,
home health, and hospice care to serve its 477,000-person
membership, which spans the six-county Denver metropolitan area.
The Hawaii site is located on Oahu and serves approximately 224,000 members, with 12 medical offices in Oahu,
three in Maui, and three on the Big Island. Three hundred
seventeen medical group physicians provide care. In contrast to Colorado, the HMO provides all outpatient and
most inpatient care. The Hawaii site operates a 217-bed
medical center and also has an internal home health agency,
accepting referrals from hospital- and clinic-based medical
group physicians. Referrals are processed via a referral
center staffed by home care nurses. The Hawaii site does
not have an internalized hospice agency and refers patients
to outside providers for hospice care only.
Principal investigators in Southern California, where
data collection and analysis were conducted, coordinated
the study. The institutional review boards of the HMO in
Hawaii, Colorado, and the external evaluator approved this
study. Participants were enrolled and followed from September 2002 to August 2004. Patients eligible to participate
in the study must have had a primary diagnosis of CHF,
COPD, or cancer and a life expectancy of 12 months or less,
have visited the emergency department or hospital at least
once within the previous year; and scored 70% or less on
the Palliative Performance Scale.[12,13] The Palliative Performance Scale is a modified Karnofsky scale that ranks the
patient’s health condition from 0 (death) to 100 (normal).
This scale was used to assess the patients’ severity of illness.


was asked, ‘‘Would you be surprised if this patient died in
the next year?’’ This indicator has been used widely to ascertain appropriateness for end-of-life care.[14,15] Patients
with physician responses indicating no surprise if the patient died within the next year were included in the study.
Discharge planners, primary care physicians, and other
specialty physicians referred potentially eligible terminally
ill patients to the study. All patients referred were assessed
for study eligibility. For those meeting the initial criteria, the
intake clerk contacted the primary care physician to determine the prognosis. Once eligibility was determined, the
intake clerk gained informed consent from the patient to
participate in the study. The intake clerk then contacted
evaluators, who randomly assigned patients to the palliative care intervention or usual care. Group assignment was
determined by blocked randomization using a computergenerated random number chart, stratified according to
study site. Based on methods established previously,[16] it
was determined that, using a significance criterion of .05, a
sample size of 300 would be necessary for a statistical
power of 0.80, using nondirectional (two-tailed) tests to
detect whether the intervention had a significant effect on
medical care costs.

Intervention
Each patient enrolled in the intervention arm received customary and usual standard care within individual health
benefit limits in addition to the IHPC program. The IHPC
program is an interdisciplinary home-based healthcare program designed to provide treatment with the primary intent
of enhancing comfort, managing symptoms, and improving
the quality of a patient’s life. Modeled after hospice programs in that it offers pain management and other comfort
care in the patient’s home, the IHPC program features three
important modifications, all of them intended to increase
access and timely referrals to the program.

� Physicians are not required to give a 6-month prognosis.
Recognizing that it is often difficult to estimate life expectancy, referral guidelines were expanded to target
patients earlier in their disease process, with an estimated 12-month life expectancy.
� Although the IHPC program emphasizes muchimproved pain control and other symptom management, patients do not have to forgo curative care, as they
do in hospice programs.
� Patients are assigned a palliative care physician who
coordinates care from a variety of healthcare providers,
including specialists and the patients’ primary care physician, thus preventing the service fragmentation that
often occurs in healthcare systems. The structure of the
IHPC program allows patients to maintain their primary care provider while also receiving home visits from
the palliative care physician.

The IHPC program uses an interdisciplinary team approach, with the core care team consisting of the patient
and family plus a physician, nurse, and social worker with
expertise in symptom management and biopsychosocial intervention. The core team is responsible for coordinating
and managing care across all settings and providing assess

-----

monitoring, and continuous reassessment of care. Comprehensive education and discussions focus on identifying
goals of care and the expected course of the disease and
expected outcomes, as well as the likelihood of success of
various treatments and interventions.
Upon admission, the team assesses the physical, medical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of the patient
and family. All patients received initial assessments from
physicians, nurses, and social workers. Additional team
members, including spiritual counselor or chaplain,
bereavement coordinator, home health aide, pharmacist,
dietitian, volunteer, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and speech therapist, join the core care team in service
provision as needed. The team convenes to develop a care
plan in accordance with the wishes of the patient and the
family. Frequency of subsequent medical visits is based on
the individual needs of the patient. Physicians conduct
home visits and are available along with nursing services on
a 24-hour on-call basis. In addition, advanced care planning
is provided that involves patients and their families in making informed decisions and choices about care goals and
end-of-life care.
The team provides education, support, and medical
care to the patients and their families. Additionally, patients
and families are trained in the use of medications, selfmanagement skills, and crisis intervention in the home with
the goal of stabilizing the patient and minimizing excessive
emergency department visits and acute care admissions.
Participants enrolled in the IHPC arm received palliative
care until death or transfer to a hospice program. (For more
information on this model, see[17,18].)

Usual Care
Usual care consisted of standard care to meet the needs of
the patients and followed Medicare guidelines for home
healthcare criteria. These services included various amounts
and levels of home health services, acute care services, primary care services, and hospice care. Patients were treated
for conditions and symptoms when they presented them to
attending physicians. Additionally, they received ongoing
home care when they met the Medicare-certified criteria for
an acute condition.

Data Collection
Data were collected from patient interviews and from the
HMO service utilization databases at each site. Interviews
were conducted via telephone within 48 hours of study
enrollment and every 30, 60, 90, and 120 days to gather
demographic information and satisfaction with services.
Undergraduate- and graduate-level research assistants,
blinded to group assignments, were recruited and trained
to conduct telephone interviews with the patient or, if the
patient was unable to participate, the primary caregiver.
Interviews were approximately 20 minutes long. Site of
death was obtained from HMO records, death certificates,
and family report.

Utilization Data
Service utilization data for each subject were collected retrospectively from the HMO mainframe database. Medical


enrolled in the study until the time of death or the end of the
study period. Medical service use data included costs for all
standard medical care as well as the costs associated with
the palliative care program. Service data included number
of emergency department visits, physician office visits, hospital days, skilled nursing facility days, home health and
palliative visits, palliative physician home visits, and days
on hospice. Service costs were calculated using actual costs
for contracted medical services (services provided by nonHMO contracted facilities in Colorado) and proxy cost estimates for all services provided within the HMO. Because
services provided within the HMO are not billed separately,
it was necessary to use proxy costs. Costs were based on
figures from 2002. Hospitalization and emergency department cost estimates were calculated using aggregated data
from more than 500,000 HMO patient records and include
ancillary services such as laboratory and radiology. Costs of
physician office visits included nurse and clerk expenses.
Home health and palliative care visits were calculated using
average time spent on each visit and multiplying that by the
cost for each discipline’s reimbursement rate. Proxy costs
generated for hospital days and emergency department visits were significantly lower than the actual costs received
from contracted providers. A total cost variable was constructed by aggregating costs for physician visits, emergency department visits, hospital days, skilled nursing facility
days, and home health or palliative days accumulated from
the point of study enrollment until the end of the study
period or death.
Enrollment in hospice was gathered retrospectively and
was only available from one study site because of difficulty
obtaining data from community hospice providers at the
second site.

Satisfaction Instrument
The Reid-Gundlach Satisfaction with Services instrument[19]

was used to measure study group member satisfaction, rating overall satisfaction with services, perception of service
providers, and likelihood of positive recommendations of
services to others. This instrument has been employed in
previous studies examining satisfaction with end-of-life
care programs.[17,20,21] Satisfaction with care was calculated
by adding the score of 12 of the 13 items (one item was a
qualitative measure) on the instrument for a total possible
score of 48. This method has been employed in previous
studies using this instrument.

Severity of Illness
The Palliative Performance Scale,[12,13] described earlier in
this manuscript, was used to measure severity of illness.

Statistical Analysis
Differences between study group sample characteristics
were analyzed using two-tailed t tests for continuous variables where the distribution was normal. Chi-square tests
were used to determine significant differences between discrete variables. Satisfaction with services was analyzed in
two ways. First, to determine the clinical meaningfulness of
the change in satisfaction according to study group, satisfaction scores were dichotomized as recommended previously[22] and used in other studies,[23] with those with a total


-----

logistic regression models were developed for dichotomous
satisfaction variables using baseline and 30-, 60-, and 90day follow-up measures. Linear regression was employed to
determine the effect of study group on the number of hospital inpatient days and emergency department days while
controlling for length of time enrolled in the study (survival)
and demographic variables. Logistical regression was used
to determine study group likelihood of dying at home.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, using the log rank statistic,
tested for study group differences in survival time. All study
participants were included in the analysis, with those who
survived to the end of the study period censored on the last
day of the study.
Medical cost data are generally skewed, requiring transformation of the dependent variable for better data fit. As
expected, analysis of total medical costs indicated that they
were extremely right-skewed; hence, a log transformation of
medical costs and Duan’s smearing estimate followed linear
regression to determine whether transformation of data resulted in a better fit. A comparison of models revealed that,
although the log transformation resulted in a normal distribution, the ordinary least squares regression explained a
larger amount of the variance (higher coefficient of determination; R[2]) and had lower error. Further comparison of the
residual distributions (the difference between the actual value of the dependent variable and its value as estimated by the
equation) revealed a linear relationship between the nontransformed costs. Based on these findings, ordinary least
squares regression was used in the final analysis, a decision
supported by other studies.[24] Owing to the differences in
survival time between study groups, analysis of service use
and medical care costs were adjusted for length of time on
the program before death or the end of the study period.
Analyses were conducted using SPSS 10.1 statistical software
package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and LIMDEP, version 8.0
(Econometric Software, Inc., Plainview, NY).

RESULTS
From September 2002 through March 2004, 718 patients
were referred to the study. Of these, 408 were excluded; 196
did not meet study eligibility criteria, 67 were eligible for
and admitted to hospice care, 59 refused, 38 died before
enrollment, 26 were part of another research project terminating their eligibility for participation in this study, and
22 moved out of the area or could not be contacted. As a
result, 310 terminally ill participants were randomly assigned to usual care (n 5 155) or the in-home palliative care
program (n 5 155). Of these, eight intervention group
members died before receiving any palliative care, and five
usual care members withdrew from the study, leaving 297
available for analysis (Figure 1).
The sample consisted of almost equal numbers of men
(51%) and women (49%), with a mean age � standard deviation of 74 � 12.0. Thirty-seven percent belonged to an
ethnic minority group; 18% were Asian/Pacific Islanders,
13% Hawaiian, 4% Latino, and 2% other. Fifty-two percent were married, 29% widowed, and 15% single or divorced. Forty-seven percent were referred to the program
with a diagnosis of cancer, 33% with CHF, and 21% with
COPD. Seventy-six percent lived in their own home or

were already in another study (n 5 26), and those who moved
out of the area or could not be contacted (n 5 22).

74% resided with a family member, primarily a spouse or a
child, and 26% lived alone. Thirty-three percent reported
having an annual income of $20,000 or less. Participants
came from an array of educational backgrounds; approximately 22% did not complete high school, 41% were high
school graduates, and 36% had some college or postgraduate education (Table 1).
Overall, the majority of the sample demographics were
consistent at both study sites, although there was some
variation. Sixty-three percent of participants in Hawaii
were minorities, compared with 10% in Colorado. This
difference in ethnic distribution is reflective of the larger
demographics within each of the states. Eighty-two percent
of participants in Hawaii were living with a family member,
compared with 72% in Colorado. Finally, 27% of participants in Colorado suffered from COPD, versus 15% of
participants in Hawaii. There were no significant differences between sites in age, education, marital status, income, or housing status (Table 1).
During the course of the study, 75% (n 5 225) of the
participants died. There were no significant differences between study groups in terms of the portion of patients dying
during the study period, although differential survival periods after enrollment in the study were found using independent-sample t tests, with those enrolled in the
intervention surviving an average of 196 � 164 days and
those in usual care surviving an average of 242 � 200 days
(P 5.03). Results of the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis did
not show significant differences in survival time between
study groups (log rank test 5 2.98; P 5.08), although subsequent analysis controlled for survival days due to the
strong trend toward differences and its potential effect on

Baseline Measures
There were no significant differences between study groups
in baseline measures other than satisfaction. Satisfaction
with services was measured at baseline after study assignment. Those randomized to intervention demonstrated significantly higher satisfaction with services at baseline than
those assigned to usual care (P5.03). Member awareness of
the results of randomization may have influenced the higher
level of satisfaction at baseline in those in the palliative care
group.

Satisfaction with Care
Analysis of satisfaction data included satisfaction at baseline (n5277) and 30 days (n 5216), 60 days (n5168), and
90 days (n5149) after study enrollment. Significant reduction in sample size at 120 days (n5136) resulted in the
exclusion of this data in analyses. There was no significant
difference in the portion of participants according to study
group reporting to be very satisfied at baseline or at 60 days
after enrollment (odds ratio (OR)51.79; 95% confidence
interval (CI)50.65–4.96; P5.26), although rates of satis

faction increased in the intervention group at 30 days
(OR53.37, 95% CI51.42–8.10; P5.006) and 90 days
(OR53.37, 95% CI50.65–4.96; P5.03) after enrollment,
with 93% of those enrolled in the palliative care group very
satisfied with care at 90 days after enrollment, compared
with 81% of usual care patients (Figure 2).

Service Use
Bivariate analysis revealed significant differences between
groups in terms of service use. Twenty percent of palliative
care members went to the emergency department, compared with 33% of usual care members (P 5.01; Cramer’s
V 5.15). Similarly, 36% of those receiving palliative care
were hospitalized, compared with 59% of those enrolled in
usual care (Po.001; Cramer’s V5.23). Number of days in
the study was significantly different according to study
group, as well. Those enrolled in the IHPC group remained
in the study for 196 days on average, whereas those in the
usual care group were in the study an average of 242 days.
Because of these differences, additional analysis was conducted after controlling for length of time on the program

(survival), age, and severity of illness. Linear regression revealed that enrollment in the IHPC reduced hospital days by
4.36 (Po.001; R[2] 5 0.14) and emergency department visits
by 0.35 (P 5.02; R[2] 5 0.04) after adjusting for survival,
age, and severity of illness.
Although enrollment in hospice was not a specific aim
of this project, rates of enrollment were reviewed. Hospice
data were available from one of the study sites, with analysis of differences between the portions enrolled in hospice
(25% of intervention vs 36% of usual care, P 5.15) and
days in hospice (t5.52; P5.60) before death revealing no
significant differences between study groups.

Costs of Care
Significant differences between palliative and usual care
members in cost of care (t5 � 3.63, Po.001) were noted.
Owing to differences in time enrolled in the study, a linear
regression was conducted to determine the portion of costs
explained by study group, controlling for days on service
(survival), age, severity of illness (measured using the Palliative Performance Scale), and primary disease. Days enrolled was significantly correlated with age and severity of
illness, although the associations between these variables
were weak (r 5 0.22 and 0.20, respectively). Three variables were significant in the regression model: age (although
the effect size was small), days enrolled (survival), and enrollment in the IHPC program (Table 2). This analysis revealed that overall costs of care for those enrolled in the
IHPC program were 33% less than those receiving standard
care (P 5.03; 95% CI 5 � $12,411 to � $780; R[2] 5 0.16).
The adjusted mean cost for patients enrolled in the palliative care group was $12,670 � $12,523, compared with
$20,222 � $30,026 for usual care. Figure 3 represents the
average cost of care per member per day according to study

Site of Death
During the course of the study, 75% of study members included in the final analysis died. For 98% of these persons,
site of death data were available. Seventy-one percent of
IHPC participants died at home, compared with 51% of
those receiving usual care (Po.001). Bivariate logistic analysis confirmed that patients enrolled in the IHPC program
were significantly more likely to die at home and less likely
to die in an acute care facility. Furthermore, after controlling for age, survival time, and medical conditions, IHPC
participants were 2.2 times as likely to die at home as those
receiving usual care (OR 5 2.20, 95% CI 5 1.3–3.7;
R[2] 5 0.27, Po.001).

DISCUSSION
This study examining the effect of the IHPC revealed several positive findings. The IHPC intervention improved patient satisfaction at 30 and 90 days after enrollment,
improved the likelihood of dying at home, and significantly
reduced the cost of care overall and by average cost per day.
First, providing an interdisciplinary palliative care team
within the home of terminally ill homebound patients earlier in the disease trajectory has a positive effect on patient
satisfaction with medical care in addition to influencing
costs of care at the end of life. Recent studies have found
that, although costs of care vary from state to state and
from hospital to hospital, they remain high in the last 2
years of life.[25] In addition, previous studies focusing on
costs of care in the last year of life found that average permember costs have remained constant over the past decade,
representing approximately 25% of all Medicare expenditures.[26] Moreover, a recent study examining costs of care in
the last 2 years of life estimated average costs to be approximately $58,000.[25] This finding suggests that end-oflife care programs should not be limited to the last 6 months
of survival, because costs associated with end-of-life care
are likely to accrue over the last 2 years of life. This study
supports findings from a previous study of this model[17] that
found significantly lower costs for palliative care than for
standard care.
There was a strong trend toward shorter survival for
those in the palliative care group (196 days vs 242 days)
after study enrollment. The differential in survival period

First, although the Palliative Performance Scale was used to
measure severity of illness, the two groups may have had
several differences in disease severity and range of medical
conditions that were not collected as part of this study. In
addition, the data do not take into account personal preferences for care at the time of study enrollment and changes
in these preferences throughout the course of the study.
Moreover, the palliative care intervention contains strong
components, such as patient education, ongoing conversations about care preferences, and care plans, that are developed to ensure adherence to patient preferences and
directives, all of which may influence patient survival time.
Several studies have found that older patients would choose
pain and symptom relief and comfort care over aggressive
treatment to extend life.[27,28] Thus, the intervention components that focused on delineating and following patient
care preferences also may have affected survival time. This
notion was supported in a chart review of a sample of 90
study participants that found that IHPC patients had fewer
911 calls and fewer life-sustaining interventions conducted
in the emergency department or intensive care unit.
Although enrollment in hospice was not a stated goal of
this program, a retrospective examination of enrollment
rates in participants of one study site was conducted that
found no significant difference in the rate of hospice enrollment between groups. This may be attributed to the fact
that the focus was on implementing the in-home palliative
care program rather than facilitating transfer to hospice and
to the structure of the in-home palliative care program.
Enrollment in hospice would entail changing care providers
from those employed at the managed care organization to a
care team in a free-standing outside (non-managed care)
organization.
Satisfaction with care improved significantly for those
enrolled in the intervention arm of this study at 30 days and
remained high, with more than 90% reporting being very
satisfied with their medical care. At 30 and 90 days, individuals in the palliative study group were three times as
likely to report high levels of satisfaction. This may be attributable to several factors. As suggested above, the palliative care model itself may be more conducive to the needs
and preferences of the patients. One study[29] found that the
most important elements in end-of-life care identified by
seriously ill patients and their families related to trust in the
treating physician, avoidance of unwanted life support,
effective communication, continuity of care, and life completion, all of which are core components of the IHPC program. Another positive finding from the current study was
the ability to enroll diverse participants and retain them in
the intervention arm. Satisfaction appeared to be high in
this diverse population.
This study was limited in several respects. The adequate sample of individual minority groups limited further
analysis of ethnic variation. This area merits additional investigation and attention given the IHPC program’s apparent success in enrolling a wide range of ethnic groups. This
study was conducted within closed-system managed care
settings; as a result, it may be less generalizable to all
healthcare settings, and the relative cost savings may not be
realized across other settings. Additionally, the use of proxy
costs of care calculated from aggregated patient records


tings. It also did not extend to an examination of the effect
of the individual model components (such as 24-hour call
center and physician home visits) on patient outcomes; this
element is a critical next step in determining what aspects of
the model are associated with key outcomes. Relying on
death at home as a measurement of patient preferences for
site of death also presented a limitation. Although a better
measurement would have been death in the patient’s preferred locale, these data were not collected as part of this
study. Finally, this study was limited in the lack of accurate
hospice data available at one of the sites.
This is one of the first rigorous studies to examine the
effectiveness of an in-home, community-based, palliative
care program for terminally ill individuals. It provides
strong clinical and financial evidence supporting the provision of palliative care in the home of terminally ill patients
with cancer, COPD, and CHF with a life expectancy of
approximately 1 year. It also suggests major policy implications for reforming end-of-life care. Evidence provided
here and in a previous study[17] supports the need for fundamental changes in the design of our healthcare system by
adjusting our current hospice benefit to better meet the
needs of patients or developing a new, ‘‘pre-hospice’’ palliative care benefit that provides a bridge between standard
medical care and hospice care.
