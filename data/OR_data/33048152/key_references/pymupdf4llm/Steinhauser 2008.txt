**Abstract**

### Background: Significant palliative care intervention has focused on physical pain and symptom control; yet less empirical evidence supports efforts to address the psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of experience. Objective: To evaluate the impact of an intervention (Outlook) that promotes discussions of end-of-life prepa- ration and completion on health outcomes in dying persons, including pain and symptoms, physical function, emotional function (anxiety and depression), spiritual well-being, and quality of life at the end of life. Design: A three-arm pilot randomized control trial. Subjects were recruited from inpatient and outpatient hos- pital, palliative care, and hospice settings. Intervention subjects met with a facilitator three times and discussed issues related to life review, forgiveness, and heritage and legacy. Attention control subjects met with a facili- tator three times and listened to a nonguided relaxation CD. True control subjects received no intervention. Measurements: Preoutcomes and postoutcomes included the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, QUAL-E, Rosow-Breslau ADL Scale, Profile of Mood States anxiety sub-scale, the CESD short version, and the Daily Spir- itual Experience Scale. Results: Eighty-two hospice eligible patients enrolled in the study; 38 were women, 35 were African American. Participants’ primary diagnoses included cancer (48), heart disease (5) lung disease (10), and other (19) Ages ranged from 28–96. Participants in the active discussion intervention showed improvements in functional sta- tus, anxiety, depression, and preparation for end of life. Conclusions: The Outlook intervention was acceptable to patients from a variety of educational and ethnic back- grounds and offers a brief, manualized, intervention for emotional and spiritual concerns.


**Introduction**

ALLIATIVE CARE SEEKS to reduce suffering and enhance
quality of life for seriously ill patients.[1,2] Increasing re

search has focused on physical pain and symptom control,
yet less empirical evidence supports efforts to address the
psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of experience. In fact,
recommendations from the 2005 National Institutes of
Health State of the Science in End of Life Care Conference
called for increased efforts to understand the existential
needs of patients and conduct and evaluate interventions to
address these concerns.[3]

In our previous research on what constitutes quality at the
end of life,[4,5] we learned that patient emotional and spiritual


well-being were identified as part of two larger domains: endof-life preparation and completion. Together, these domains incorporate both the need for looking back to assess the life lived
as well as looking forward to prepare themselves and their family for the remaining weeks or months of life.[4] For some patients, that assessment occurs within a traditional religious context, for others it is part of a larger process of meaning-making
facilitated by locating their illness experience in the context of
the values and preferences of a whole life. Completion and
preparation included issues of reviewing life, resolving conflicts, achieving forgiveness, spending time with family and
friends, contributing to others and saying good-bye.[4,6]

Therefore, we developed a new intervention to foster expression of end-of-life preparation and completion and con

ducted a pilot randomized control trial to evaluate the impact of this intervention on physical functioning, emotional
function (anxiety and depression) and quality of life at the
end of life. In this paper, we present the results of the pilot
trial. The intervention (called Outlook) content and structure
is based on robust evidence from the social gerontology life
review and the health psychology self-disclosure literatures.

**_Life review: Making sense of a life lived_**

For social gerontologists, late adulthood includes the developmental task of life review, which contains components
of reminiscence, reconciliation, forgiveness, and resolution
of past conflicts.[7] It offers a chance to “edit” one’s life story,
perhaps in the telling or review, “making it right” by integrating events in the broader arc of a full life-course.[8–10]

In recent years, several studies have evaluated the effects
of life review interventions on psychosocial outcomes.
Haight’s trial of life review among homebound elderly
showed improved psychological well-being and life satisfaction up to 8 weeks after the intervention.[11] Bohlheijmer et
al.[12] and Erlin et al.[13] each found improved levels of depression, and Erlin et al, using life review among persons
with AIDS also demonstrated improved purpose, self-esteem, and quality of life. Finally Bohlmiejer et al.’s metaanalyses of 20 studies in depressed older adults showed improvements in depressive symptomatology. The effect sizes
of 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] � 0.31–1.37) were statistically and clinically comparable to pharmacotherapy and
psychological treatments. The majority of life review interventions have been conducted among persons with chronic
mental or physical health conditions, with fewer conducted
in patients facing the end of life.

**_Self-disclosure facilitates healing_**

An entire literature demonstrates a variety of positive outcomes associated with expressing personally stressful or
emotionally laden experiences.[14–20]


Conceptually, self-disclosure of stressful experiences is associated with the opportunity to develop a coherent personal
narrative that allows a person to describe an event and explore its meaning and significance in their life’s context. By
putting stress into words,[21] individuals are able to identify,
acknowledge, classify, and assimilate these emotional experiences into a larger spiritual and psychosocial framework.[22]

A meta-analysis of 146 randomized control trials of disclosure that suggested this technique is effective with an average effect size of 0.075.[23] Studies with higher doses of disclosure (at least 3 sessions), increased session spacing
(weekly), greater length (longer than 15 minutes), and with
follow-up in less than 1 month, conducted among populations with current physical or psychological problems, and
oral and in-person versus written have demonstrated larger
effects sizes.

**_Conceptual model_**

Based on the literature outlined above, we developed the
following conceptual model as the foundation for our intervention, which we call Outlook. Patients living with advanced serious illness face challenges associated with physical, psychosocial, spiritual, and emotional concerns.
Attention to each is required to reduce suffering and increase
quality of life.[24] Specific developmental tasks include: sense
of completion in relationships, exploring issues of regret and
forgiveness, sense of gratitude and appreciation, life review
and transmission of knowledge and wisdom. These tasks
have been identified as components of domains of end-oflife preparation and completion. Attention to these tasks is
proposed to influence health outcomes including quality of
life, depressive symptoms, and anxiety (Fig. 1).

nonguided relaxation CD, to use as an attention control. We
then tested these in a three-armed trial of the intervention,
attention control and true control on health outcomes. The
pilot study goals were to assess feasibility and initial efficacy.

**_Subjects_**

Patients were recruited from: two local hospices, a palliative care service, home based care program, and the Extended Care and Rehabilitation Center at the Durham VA
Medical Center and inpatient units at Duke University Medical Center. Patients were eligible if their physicians estimated them to have a prognosis of less than 6 months to live.
To reduce selection bias, referral conversations focused on
clinical criteria, versus physician judgment of willingness to
participate. Patients unable to speak or severely cognitively
impaired were excluded from the study. All other clinically
eligible patients were approached for participation. In addition, because sessions occurred in patients’ homes, we limited inclusion to subjects living within a 35-mile radius of
Durham, North Carolina.

**_Procedure_**

After obtaining informed consent, participants completed a
baseline survey, and then were randomly assigned to one of
three groups. Subjects assigned to the first group (“treatment”)
were interviewed three times, spaced a week apart, for a period of 45 minutes to 1 hour each and asked to discuss issues
related to life completion and preparation. Session 1, focused
on life review, accomplishments, proudest moments, and
cherished times. One week later, Session 2 focused on issues
of forgiveness, things they would have done differently,
things left unsaid or undone. In the final week, Session 3 focused on lessons learned, heritage, and legacy. To ensure
replicability, the interventionist followed the questions outlined in the training manual. Probes were limited to asking if
participants had more to add to each specific topic (Table 1).
Subjects in the second group (“relaxation meditation”)
also met with a facilitator, on three occasions, spaced a week
apart, for a period of 45 minutes each and listened to a
nonguided relaxation tape. The second group, led by a facilitator and with session time equivalence, was essential to
demonstrating that the effects of “treatment” were not
simply a result of greater attention but, in fact, due to the in

tervention content of end-of-life preparation and life
completion tasks. The third group of participants (“no intervention”—true control) was not contacted between preassessment and postassessment. One week and 2 weeks after the three sessions (or their timing equivalent, for
controls), participants in all groups completed posttest measures. One research assistant conducted the intervention and
relaxation meditation sessions. The other research assistant
conducted preassessments and postassessments and was
blinded to subjects’ intervention group assignment (Fig. 2).

**_Measures_**

Baseline measures assessed pain and symptoms (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale),[25] functional status (RosowBreslau ADL scale),[26] anxiety (Profile of Mood States subscale),[27] depression (Center for Epidemiologic Study of
Depression CESD),[28] quality of life at the end of life (including preparation and completion domains) (the QUALE),[6] and daily spiritual experience (The Daily Spiritual Experience Scale).[29] We also administered a brief measure of
family social support.[30] To reduce burden, postmeasures did
not include daily spiritual experience or family social support measures. All other measures were repeated after subjects completed the intervention period. Quantitative analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

**Results**

Over an 18-month period we contacted 209 eligible patients. One hundred twenty-seven refused to participate
(74%–58%, general refusal; 19%–15%, caregiver declined;
15%–12%, too much time; 19%–15%, too sick). Eighty-two
patients enrolled in the study and 42 completed all data
points. Of the 82 enrolled patients, 38 were women, 35 were
African American. Forty-eight patients entered the study
with a primary diagnosis of cancer, 5 with heart disease, 10
with lung disease, and 19 with other illnesses such as endstage renal disease or neurodegenerative disease. Forty-eight
were from Duke Hospital, 18 from local hospices, and 15
from the VA. In addition, 40% of the sample was married,
30% divorced, 12% widowed, and 13% never married. There
was a breadth of educational background where 15% had
less than a high school education, 47% graduated high
school; 17% had some college, 9% were college graduates,
and 11% had a graduate or professional degree. Ages ranged

from 28–96. Patients from varying backgrounds completed
the intervention with similar facility and responded with
ease to the semistructured formatted that set general parameters but self-guidance within. (Detailed qualitative results are reported elsewhere.)
At baseline, each arm contained 26 participants (Table 2),
and, with attrition, the life completion intervention arm included 9 participants, relaxation meditation 11 participants,
and control 16 participants. Because all participants were at
the very end of life, attrition was due to severe functional
decline (e.g. losing consciousness), or death. Differences in
attrition by group were not thought to be associated with the
intervention content or participation.
Intervention participants showed improvements in functional status, anxiety, depression, and preparation for end of
life (a QUAL-E domain). For those in the intervention arm,
functional status improved from a total score of 26.1 to 22.7,
compared to attention control (26.3 to 24.8) and true control
(28.4 to 28.3). Anxiety decreased among intervention patients
from 6.4 to 3.7 as compared with anxiety increases in those
in attention control (4.4 to 5.0) and true control (4.4 to 5.6).


Similarly, intervention participants’ depression scores decreased (11.8 to 9.1) whereas attention control subjects’ depressive symptoms were the same (10.1 to 10.0) and true control participant scores worsened (10.7 to 11.9). We did not
see differences in completion scores, among the three arms.
End-of-life preparation improved among intervention subjects from 3.4 to 3.7 and decreased for attention control (4.0
to 3.8) and true control (4.2 to 3.4).
To better understand the treatment effects in the pilot
study, we examined predictors of attrition. Several patientlevel characteristics were associated with differential rates of
dropout. Patients who were widowed, older age, had lower
daily spiritual experience scores, had lung disease, and were
referred from hospice or home health care all were more
likely to not complete the study (either due to illness or
death). Including these predictors of dropout in the estimation of the main study outcomes relaxes the missing data assumption to missing at random (MAR). In MAR, missing
data can depend on any observed data (i.e., other variables
or the outcomes at earlier time points), but not the actual
missing value. We, therefore, constructed a multivariate nor

mal model, which included all of the predictors of dropout
and calculated maximum likelihood estimates of the main
study outcomes, stratified by treatment arm. The expectation-maximization algorithm (EM) in PROCM MI (SAS, v9)
was used for estimation (Table 3).
Results suggest very little improvement in any outcomes
is seen in the “relaxation” and “true control” arms of the
study. The intervention arm, however, shows improvement
in all of the study outcomes. In other words, these analyses
suggested several measurable factors were driving differential attrition. When we account for those factors that predict
dropout, the intervention arm’s positive trends remain.

**Discussion**

The Outlook intervention is brief, fully manualized, exportable, and acceptable to patients with a range of illnesses.
Furthermore, patients participated with similar facility regardless of broad variation in social background and socioeconomic status. The intervention was conducted successfully by a nonphysician clinician demonstrating the
usefulness of multi-disciplinary team. The results of this paper suggest discussions of preparation and life completion
influence patient symptoms and quality of life among persons with advanced life-limiting illness.
Sample size was not large enough to demonstrate statistical significance; however, participants in the active discussion intervention showed improvements in functional status, anxiety, depression, and preparation for end of life (a
QUAL-E domain). The life review literature cites improvements in depressive symptomatology as a consistent outcome.[12,13] Similar trends from this study extend that work
to the arena of end-of-life. In contrast, anxiety is not frequently assessed in life review randomized control trials.
However, because many patients with advanced serious illness struggle with anxiety, finding interventions, like Outlook, that may improve that symptom will add to palliative
clinicians’ armamentarium. We also saw positive trends in
functional status. For patients approaching the end of life,
maintaining or improving independence and one’s ability to


care for oneself is highly valued by patients and families[4]

and palliative care clinicians and researchers emphasize
maximizing functional status as a key outcome for seriously
ill and dying patients. Similarly, patients and families, identify preparation as a central domain of quality at end of life.[4,5]

The preparation subscale, which measures issues of regret,
burden, and things done differently, showed positive movement in the intervention group.
We did not see changes in the QUAL-E subscale measuring
relationships with health care provider or in the completion
subscale. The completion subscale includes items measuring
both internal completion (e.g., coming to peace) and external
completion (e.g., saying important things to family). The stability in this measure may be due to the individual items which
assessed sense of having a chance to say good-bye, feeling at
peace, having someone with whom they could share their
deepest thoughts and feeling that they were able to share important things with others. These items encompassed external
expressions of completion and may not have tapped strongly
the internal sense. The small sample size may have affected
our ability to see differences. In a fuller test of the intervention,
we will include an assessment of internally gauged faith and
purpose. It may be that the post-tests did not have enough time
from intervention to test change. Furthermore, it is possible
that expectations changed due to the intervention resulting in
response shifts that confounded the ability of the subscale to
detect real change.
Previous tests of life review demonstrate improvements
in anxiety, depression and quality of life. Our newly designed intervention included similar content, but also extended the literature in at least two important ways. Similar
to the structure of other life review interventions, the first
session focused on the past with discussion of biographical
context, accomplishments, and cherished times. In the second session, we extended the life review content to probe in
depth about issues of regret and forgiveness. Recent literature has begun to explore the centrality of this topic to overall quality of life.
Several studies have looked at the direct link between forgiveness and physical health.[31,32–35] Although little is known

empirically about the relationship between forgiveness and
health, theorists suggest that forgiveness reduces hostility,
and therefore should be related to: (1) a decrease in chronic
blaming, anger, and hostility; (2) self-efficacy to take healthrelated actions; (3) social support; and (4) transcendent consciousness.[36,37] Although in its infancy, this literature has
demonstrated forgiveness to be negatively correlated with
poor health habits. Most importantly and relevant to the
findings presented here, increases in forgiveness have been
correlated with less negative affect, such as anxiety and depression.[32–34] The preparation subscale, which measures regret, did show improvements for those in the intervention
arm.
In a second departure from many life review interventions, the intervention session provided participants with an
opportunity to discuss their heritage and legacy and therefore ending with a future orientation. Involvement in discussions of lessons learned and wisdom to be shared with
the next generation (Table 1) coincides with findings from
previous studies documenting the importance of contributing to others as a central feature of quality at the end of life.
Providing an opportunity to look forward and set goals for
the future supports the human development model and assumes that personal growth may occur through out all stages
of life. Indeed, participants in this study were within weeks
and sometimes days of death.
In recent years, Chochinov et al.[38] have developed and
tested a meaning-making intervention “dignity therapy” for
those with terminal illness (particularly patients with advanced cancer). Participants complete eight sessions and produce a “generativity document” that is transcribed and made
into hard copy. In their qualitative work to develop the intervention, the authors identify core components of dignity
preserving perspectives and dignity preserving practices.
The former includes: continuity of self, role preservation,
generativity/legacy, maintenance of pride, hopefulness, autonomy/control, acceptance, and resistance. Related practices attend to living in the moment, maintaining normalcy,
and seeking spiritual support. These topics are addressed explicitly in six clinician-guided sessions.
Interestingly, in the process of exploring life review, forgiveness and heritage and legacy, participants in our study
came to address similar topics but through a briefer, more
self-guided approach. This lends credence to viewing life review as a necessary developmental task that emerges at end
of life, or may be forced to emerge with the challenges of
life-limiting illness. Our intervention differs by being briefer
and not producing a document. Findings suggest that the
power of bearing witness, may prove equally powerful. In
the handouts, participants were encouraged to develop
legacy items, be they photo albums, letters, or other meaningful and tangible forms of legacy.
There were several limitations associated with the study.
As noted, approximately 50% of participants were not able
to complete the study due to functional decline or death.
Dropout was particularly notable among hospice referrals,
where the local lengths of stay mirror the short national median lengths of stay at approximately 15 days.[50] High attrition also is likely related to clinician prognostication, which
when identifying patients with less the 6 months to live, often yields samples of patients with weeks to live.[51] Future
intervention may extend the inclusion criteria to patients


with advanced life limiting illness, as indicated by clinical
criteria.
National consensus panels and a variety of clinicians and
researchers have called for interventions to help seriously
ill patients address issues of spirituality, meaning, and life
review. The data from this pilot study suggest that Outlook is a brief, transportable, manualized intervention acceptable to patients from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds and may be a useful means of addressing
emotional and existential issues for patients at the end
of life.
