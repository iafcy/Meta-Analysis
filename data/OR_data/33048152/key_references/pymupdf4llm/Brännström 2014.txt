_Received 4 March 2014; revised 27 June 2014; accepted 11 July 2014_


**Aims** We evaluated the outcome of person-centred and integrated Palliative advanced home caRE and heart FailurE caRe
(PREFER) with regard to patient symptoms, health-related quality of life (HQRL), and hospitalizations compared with
usual care.
_....................................................................................................................................................................._
**Methods** From January 2011 to October 2012, 36 (26 males, 10 females, mean age 81.9 years) patients with chronic heart
**and results** failure (NYHA class III–IV) were randomized to PREFER and 36 (25 males, 11 females, mean age 76.6 years)
to the control group at a single centre. Prospective assessments were made at 1, 3, and 6 months using the
Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, Euro Qol, Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, and rehospitalizations.
Between-group analysis revealed that patients receiving PREFER had improved HRQL compared with controls
(57.6 ± 19.2 vs. 48.5 ± 24.4, age-adjusted P-value = 0.05). Within-group analysis revealed a 26% improvement in the
PREFER group for HRQL (P = 0.046) compared with 3% (P = 0.82) in the control group. Nausea was improved in the
PREFER group (2.4 ± 2.7 vs. 1.7 ± 1.7, P = 0.02), and total symptom burden, self-efficacy, and quality of life improved
by 18% (P = 0.035), 17% (P = 0.041), and 24% (P = 0.047), respectively. NYHA class improved in 11 of the 28 (39%)
PREFER patients compared with 3 of the 29 (10%) control patients (P = 0.015). Fifteen rehospitalizations (103 days)
occurred in the PREFER group, compared with 53 (305 days) in the control group.
_....................................................................................................................................................................._
**Conclusion** Person-centred care combined with active heart failure and palliative care at home has the potential to improve
quality of life and morbidity substantially in patients with severe chronic heart failure.

## Introduction

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a serious condition with a prognosis
worse than many forms of cancer.[1] Patients with CHF have symptoms as severe and distressing as those of cancer patients, but they
do not have equal access to palliative care.[2] The course of CHF is
unpredictable, making it difficult to identify a specific time point to
introduce palliative care to heart failure management.[3] Recently,
we found large differences in the quality of end-of-life care in the


Swedish Register of Palliative Care between patients with heart
disease and those with cancer.[4] For example, patients with heart
disease experience more shortness of breath and have fewer
drugs prescribed on demand against the usual symptoms, compared with patients with cancer.[4] In addition, patients with CHF
often require frequent hospitalizations and readmissions, suggesting insufficient management of these patients, which may be due
to the frequency of concomitant chronic diseases. The European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) has pointed out that selected

patients require palliative care services in addition to the heart
failure management programme.[3] Guidelines[5] have concluded that
a great need exists for new models of integrated care, such as
active heart failure and palliative care, in order to facilitate care
equality for dying patients regardless of diagnosis. This idea is
also in line with the World Health Organization’s description
of palliative care.[6] We found some information in the literature
concerning the advantages and effects of an in-hospital specialist
heart failure- and home-based palliative care for patients with
severe CHF.[7] A Cochrane review showed that home palliative care
reduces symptom burden, particularly for patients with cancer,
but more research is needed on valid outcomes in populations
with non-malignant conditions and powered studies are required
to compare different models of home palliative care.[8]

Here, we report the clinical outcome of a new model that
integrates Palliative advanced home caRE and heart FailurE caRe
(PREFER) for patients with severe CHF (Figure 1) as described
previously.[9] Our hypothesis was that the combination of key
components for delivering heart failure care and palliative care
contained in PREFER should reduce the total symptom burden,
increase health-related quality of life (HRQL) and functional capacity, and reduce morbidity.
Our primary aim was to evaluate the effects of the PREFER intervention on symptom burden, quality of life (QoL), and functional
classes compared with usual care. The secondary aim was to study
the effect of the PREFER model on the number of hospitalizations
and days spent in hospital.


## Methods

##### Study design and setting


This was a prospective randomized study with an open non-blinded
design. Patients were randomized with envelopes in blocks of 20 to
the PREFER intervention group (n = 36) or to usual care (n = 36).
Usual care was provided mainly by general practitioners or doctors
and/or the nurse-led heart failure clinic at the Medicine-Geriatrics
department. After 6 months (±2 weeks) the patients were transferred to the original care provider following the establishment
of an individual care plan. The research context was an advanced
home care unit providing services Monday–Friday during the day
and based in a county hospital located in northern Sweden. The
home visits and the phone calls varied substantially from several
times per day to every other week. Diuretic administration also
varied substantially between patients due to the severity of heart
failure, from none to several times per day. Diuretics were administered s.c. or i.v. at home on demand for worsening symptoms
when oral therapy was insufficient. Blood sampling, e.g. for determination of electrolytes, creatinine, and BNP, and transmission of
the ECG to the hospital, were performed in the patient’s home.
No i.v. inotrope was administered at home.

##### Participants


The Department of Medicine-Geriatrics serves a catchment area
of 75 000 inhabitants. The participants in the PREFER trial were


-----

inhabitants who had their primary healthcare centre within 30 km
of the hospital.
Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CHF[1] and cared for
at the Department of Medicine-Geriatrics or primary healthcare
centres and who met the criteria of the ESC[5] were asked to
participate in the study. Inclusion criteria comprised CHF with
NYHA functional classes III − IV symptoms and at least one of
the following: at least one hospitalized episode of worsening heart
failure that resolved with the injection/infusion of diuretics or
the addition of other heart failure treatment in the preceding 6
months and regarded as being ‘optimally treated’ according to the
responsible physician; need for frequent or continual i.v. support;
chronically poor QoL based on a visual analogue scale (VAS)
score <50; signs of cardiac cachexia, defined as an involuntary
non-oedematous weight loss ≥6% of total body weight within the
preceding 6–12 months; and life expectancy of <1 year. Exclusion
criteria were patients who did not want to participate in the
study; had severe communication problems; had severe dementia
or other serious diseases in which heart failure was of secondary
importance; with other life-threatening illnesses as their primary
diagnosis and an expected short survival time; whose primary care
centre responsible for their care was located >30 km from the
hospital; and who were already participating in another clinical trial.
We estimated a prevalence of CHF of 2% (1500), and ∼32% (480)
of these would be in NYHA class III–IV according to a Swedish


registry study.[1][0] We identified 517 patients eligible for the study,
of whom 72 were finally randomized (Figure 2).

## Randomization and intervention


Patients (n = 72) were randomized into either the PREFER intervention (n = 36) or the control group (n = 36). Patients in the intervention group were offered a multidisciplinary approach involving
collaboration between specialists in palliative and heart failure care,
i.e. specialized nurses, palliative care nurses, cardiologist, palliative care physician, physiotherapist, and occupational therapist. The
patients were also offered structured, person-centred care (PCC)
at home.[11] PCC is one of the key components and cornerstones
in the PREFER model. PCC is described as a partnership between
patients/carers and professional caregivers, and includes initiating,
working on, and documenting the partnership. The starting point
is the patient’s narrative, which is recorded in a structured manner and from which a mutual care plan is created that incorporates
goals and strategies for implementation and follow-up.[11]

The intervention was carried out as follows: (i) after identifying
a patient who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had no exclusion
criteria earlier described in the design paper,[1][2] a responsible physician and nurse were identified for each patient; (ii) the patient was
then called for a thorough medical examination by the responsible
physician with identification of co-morbidities and assessment of
physiological, social, and spiritual needs; followed by (iii) meeting


-----

with nurses who used a model for person-centred palliative care.
The model is called the six Ss and consist of the six S key words;
self-image, self-determination, social relationships, symptom control, synthesis, and surrender,[1][2] and continued through; (iv) regular
meetings about the patients’ conditions within the team twice a
month; and, finally, (v) between the meetings brief discussions took
place out between the team members (n = 7) at the unit and information was shared by the documentation in medical records and
phone calls.
The team was responsible for the total care, i.e. including
co-morbidities. Assessments of symptoms, QoL, and risks of decubitus, falling, and malnutrition were continually performed in a
structured way with validated questionnaires or in the national
quality of care registry by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR). Further registrations in the national
palliative registry and heart failure registry were performed. The
Swedish Palliative Registry is a nationwide quality registry aimed
at improving end-of-life care. The goal of the registry is to list and
report quality indicators related to care during the last week of
life in the case of all expected deaths in Sweden. This was fulfilled
by each profession and documented independently, but also in the
team in order to support the patient and attain the goals. The structure of care was also based on goals and steps in the process of
providing palliative care for patients with CHF as recommended by
the ESC[1][,][5][,][9] and developed within the PREFER model as described
previously.[1][2]

One of the researchers (M.B.) was not involved in the treatment
and care of the patients; the other researcher (K.B.) shared responsibility for cardiac treatment together with a general practitioner
specialized in palliative medicine.

## Assessments and outcomes

Prospective assessments were made at baseline and 1, 3, and 6
months of follow-up using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment
Scale (ESAS), Euro Qol (EQ-5D), and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy
Questionnaire (KCCQ). Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics were measured at baseline using a pre-specified protocol. If a
categorical variable was denoted as unknown it was registered as
a no answer. The questionnaires (Qs) were filled in by the patients
themselves, baseline. At and the final 6 month Qs were filled in at
the research unit. At the 1 and 3 month visits, Qs were filled in at
home and returned in an envelope. The response rate was 100%
at baseline and 1 month. At 2 months, four Qs were missing and
at 6 months six Qs were missing (one due to dementia).
The ESAS, a valid and reliable tool,[1][3] was used to measure symptom burden: pain, tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, well-being, and shortness of breath. The severity
of each symptom at the time of assessment is rated on a 10-item
numerical scale.[1][3] The item ‘other’ was not included in the analysis
due to very few answers.
The HRQL was measured using EQ-5D, a generic, single index
that defines health in the five dimensions of mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.[1][4][,][1][5] For each
dimension, the health of the patient is rated by the patient on a


5-point scale EQ-5D 5 L:[20] no problem, slight problems, moderate
problems, severe problems, and impossible or extremely difficult
problems. A VAS was also used.[1][4]

The QoL was also measured using the disease-specific instrument, the KCCQ, which measures physical limitation, symptoms
(frequency, severity, and recent change over time), QoL, social
interference, and self-efficacy. The KCCQ is a valid and reliable
instrument in a Swedish CHF population.[1][6] Scores are transformed
to a range of 0–100, in which higher scores reflect better health
status.

## Statistical analysis


From January 2011 to October 2012, we randomized 72 patients
(36 in the PREFER and 36 as controls, i.e. usual care). The


Patients with CHF (NYHA class III–IV) were considered to have
a mean total symptom burden corresponding to 50 points out
of 100 according to the ESAS scale and compared with findings
by Follwell et al.[1][7] for patients with cancer. The patients in that
study had a mean ESAS Distress Score (EDS) of 39.5 at baseline,
and a mean improvement in the EDS of 8.8 points. The PREFER
model was created to improve the mean symptom burden by at
least 25% compared with the control group. With a power of 80%,
significance level of P < 0.05, and an estimated drop-out rate of
15%, 31 patients were needed in each arm (total 62 patients). Due
to patients dropping out, mainly due to deaths (12 patients), the
number of participants was increased to 36 in each arm.
Results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD)
or frequencies expressed as percentages. Comparisons between
the intervention and control groups were made using the 𝜒 [2]

test for proportions and Student’s t-test for normally distributed
continuous variables. The Shapiro–Wilk statistic was used to test
normality. If the distributions were not normal or ordinal, the
Mann–Whitney U-test or 𝜒 [2] with Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables was used. For within-group analysis of non-normally
distributed data, the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was
used. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds
ratio and 95% confidence interval for different variables after
adjusting for age differences between the groups. All analyses
were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A P-value <0.05
was considered significant. The data were analysed using PASW
Statistics 18.

##### Ethics


Oral and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964. The Regional Ethics
Committee for Human Research at Umeå University (reference
number 2010-294-31 M) approved the study, which was registered
at www.clinicaltrials.gov (registration number NCT01304381).

## Results


-----

two groups were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics except for mean age (PREFER 81.9 ± 7.2 years vs. control
76.6 ± 10.2 years, P = 0.012; Table 1).
All patients were regarded as optimally treated by their physicians, and pharmacological treatment was characterized by a
relatively high number of evidence-based therapies with regard
to inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system, beta-blockers, and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (Table 1). There were a
number of serious co-morbidities but there was no statistically
significant difference between the two groups (Table 1). Twelve
patients died during the study; the remaining 60 patients completed
the study.

##### Euro Qol-5D: health-related quality of life

No difference was found between the two treatment groups
at baseline for HRQL assessed with the EQ-5D. At 6 months,
the PREFER group had an increased HRQL, from 47.7 ± 19.4 to
60.4 ± 20.6, compared with 48.2 ± 23.1 vs. 52.3 ± 23.2 for controls
(age-adjusted P-value = 0.10). The between-group analysis of the
age-adjusted delta-value of HRQL from baseline to 6 months was
significantly (P = 0.02) better for patients in the PREFER group than
for controls.
If the last measurement at 1, 3, or 6 months was analysed,
the delta-difference of HRQL, after adjusting for age, was still
significantly better (P = 0.04) in the PREFER group.
For the five dimensions of the EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, usual
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), no significant
differences were found between the groups (data not shown).
In a paired within-group analysis of the PREFER group, HRQL
increased 28% from baseline to 6 months (from 46.9 ± 21.3 to
60.4 ± 20.6, P = 0.013). If all measurements of HRQL (1, 3, and 6
months) were included, the increase was 20% (from 48.2 ± 19.8 to
57.6 ± 19.2, P = 0.026). Corresponding values for the control group
were 3% (from 50.7 ± 24.2 to 52.3 ± 23.2, P = 0.61) and 1.0% (from
48.7 ± 24.0 to 49.6 ± 23.8, P = 0.74), respectively. For the other
dimensions, no significant differences were found.


shown) and 6 months. However, in the PREFER group, we noted
an increase in 19 summary scores and a decrease in one. The
increase was statistically significant for total symptom burden (18%,
_P = 0.035), self-efficacy (17%, P = 0.041), and QoL (24%, P = 0.047;_
_Table 2)._
In the control group, we found no significant difference in
any dimension (data not shown). Increases were observed in 11
dimensions and decreases in 9.

##### Functional classes


Functional classes improved in the PREFER group compared with
controls, including a significant difference in mean NYHA class at
6 months (2.9 ± 0.65 vs. 3.3 ± 0.58, P = 0.012, baseline 3.2 vs. 3.1;
_Table 3). In the PREFER group, improvement was seen in 11 out_
of 28 (39%) vs. 3 out of 32 (9%) in the control group (P = 0.015).
Worsening NYHA functional class was found in 2 out of 28 (7%)
vs. 5 out of 32 (16%) patients in the PREFER and control groups,
respectively.

##### Hospitalizations


##### The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale

No significant differences were found between the PREFER and
control groups in regard to any item of the ESAS scale or after
adjusting for age difference (data not shown). Nausea was significantly improved (2.3 ± 2.7 vs. 1.2 ± 1.7, P = 0.02) in the PREFER
group, but not in the control group. Numerical improvements were
observed in eight out of nine items in the PREFER group compared
with four out of nine in the control group. The item ‘other’ was
not included due to very few answers,


The mean number of hospitalizations was significantly lower in
the PREFER group than in the control group (0.42 ± 0.60 vs.
1.47 ± 1.81, P = 0.009; Table 4). The total number of hospitalizations was 15 in the PREFER group and 53 in the control group. The
total number of days spent in hospital was 408, range 1–46 days,
being 103 (range 1–45 days) in the PREFER group and 305 (range
2–46 days) in the control group. The mean number of days was
significantly (2.9 ± 8.3 vs. 8.5 ± 12.4, P = 0.011) lower in the PREFER group compared with the control group. The number of days
spent in hospital was also significantly lower in the PREFER group
at the Departments of Medicine-Geriatrics (100, range 1–45 vs.
242, range 2–46 days) and Surgery (0 vs. 56, range 2–21 days)
(Table 3). Days in other departments did not differ significantly (3,
range 1–2 vs. 7, range 1–6 days).
No statistically significant (P = 0.34) difference (8 vs. 4 patients)
in mortality occurred during 6 months.

##### Resource utilization


##### Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire

No significant differences were found between the two treatment
groups for all dimensions of the KCCQ at baseline (data not


There were significant differences in the utilization of visits and
phone calls or prescriptions of physicians and nurses between
the PREFER and usual care group at the outpatient clinic of the
hospitals and the primary healthcare centres (Table 4). Additionally,
within the PREFER team there were 158 additional physician visits
and 1031 nurse visits at the patient’s home, and 36 phone call
and/or drug prescriptions by the physician and 225 phone calls
and/or prescriptions by the nurses. Summarizing all this, the most
striking difference was found between nurse visits in the PREFER
group and the usual care group (1075 vs. 230; P = 0.000). On the
other hand, phone calls and prescriptions by doctors were more
common in the usual care group (108 vs. 231), while physician’s
visits were somewhat similar (194 vs. 201).

## Discussion

Our main findings were significant improvements with the PREFER
intervention compared with usual care in regards to HRQL, NYHA,
and morbidity, with reductions in the number of hospitalizations
and days spent in hospital. Moreover, in the within-group analysis
of the usual care and the PREFER groups, patients in the PREFER
group showed increases in most dimensions of the KCCQ, and


were significantly improved in terms of total symptom burden,
self-efficacy, and QoL. The symptomatic improvement of patients
in the PREFER group was accompanied by a marked reduction in
the need for hospitalization.
The PREFER model was developed from the goals and steps
in the process of providing palliative care for patients with CHF
as recommended by the ESC.[1][,][5][,][9] These were: patient features;
confirm diagnosis; patient education; establishment of an advanced

care plan; required organization of services; symptom management; identifying end-stage heart failure; breaking bad news to the
patient and family; and establishing new goals for care. The PREFER
model also includes goals of support to relatives/bereavement and
to the team members.[1][2] The strategy used in the PREFER model
goes beyond traditional heart failure management at hospitals by
including person-centred and specialized palliative care.
One of the main differences from standard heart failure management is that the PREFER team takes more comprehensive care of
the person, taking into consideration symptoms and signs related
to accompanying co-morbidities, such as stroke, renal dysfunction,
pulmonary disorders, anaemia, and even cancer, which were common in the present study.
In the PREFER group, we used PCC in addition to the identitypromoting care concept applied to palliative care planning.[1][2]

Earlier studies showed that being met as a person (i.e. with trust
and a willingness to help) by professional caregivers at home seems
to increase feelings of security,[1][8] and that seeing the patients in
their home situation helps the team to tailor care to the persons’
way of life.[1][9] To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to evaluate a new approach for CHF management by integrating
specialized palliative home care and heart failure care. This study
provides new information about the PREFER model resulting in
improved HRQL, total symptom burden, and NYHA functional
class in association with reductions in the number of hospitalizations and days spent in hospital at both the Medicine-Geriatrics
and Surgery departments. These findings are in line with the
results of the PCC-HF study,[20] which showed that PCC during
in-hospital care impacts the length of stay in the hospital and
maintained functional performance.


Relapses and rehospitalizations are very common in patients
with CHF. This condition has the highest rate of rehospitalization
at departments of medicine[2][1] and is very costly and resource
demanding.[22] County councils expend much effort, with limited
success, to reduce both the length of stay and rehospitalization for
these patients. In line with Kossovsky et al.,[23] Clarke,[24] and Ekman
_et al.,[20]_ we also support the idea that relapses and length of stay and
rehospitalization can be reduced by improving the quality of care,
and that common practice should be rethought and re-evaluated
with regard to shortening of the length of hospitalizations through
rapid discharge after symptom relief. Another type of structure of
CHF care also seems to be needed.[9] The management of patients
with CHF and their co-morbidities is very complex and a challenge
to all of the healthcare personnel and systems involved. While CHF
is largely managed in primary care in mild to moderate stages,
the problems arise in more advanced situations, especially when
the syndrome of CHF is accompanied by co-morbidities. This is
not easily handled by primary healthcare physicians.[25] A bridge
between acute care of CHF at hospitals and primary healthcare
has been successfully fulfilled by heart failure clinics,[26] which focus
primarily on the management of heart failure. The strategy of
PREFER goes beyond traditional heart failure management in clinics
by including specialized palliative care as practised for cancer
patients. One of the main differences from standard heart failure
management is that PREFER also takes more comprehensive care
of accompanying co-morbidities. The team is responsible for the
total care of the patient. Assessment of symptoms, QoL, and risks
of decubitus, falling, and malnutrition is continual. This does not
mean that responsibility is removed from the patient’s general
practitioner or other specialists, but rather that they are included

in the collaboration. PREFER is also organized in close co-operation
with out-of-hours palliative advanced home care. This team is
fully informed of the identities of the patients and knows how to
respond to calls.
On the other hand, PREFER differs from traditional palliative
care by including active heart failure treatment with acute heart
resuscitation if needed, according to the patient’s expressed
desire.[1][9][,][27] Even more important is the intention to use all modern
pharmacological treatments and other types of devices, such as
CRT, if necessary, to reduce symptom burden. The decision to
include this form of active treatment arises from the difficulty
in defining a transition point to palliative care for heart failure
patients.[1][9][,][27][,][28] Their lives are sometimes described as ‘living near
death’ or ‘a roller coaster life’, i.e. an ongoing oscillation between
ups and downs.[1][8] The unpredictable progression of the illness
leads to a great risk that these patients and their close relatives
will not have access to palliative care.[1][,][5]

The mechanisms underlying the favourable results are not evident. Several components are probably related to each other, and
it could be difficult to separate them to explain the effectiveness
of the intervention.[29] In some cases, the recognition of important
co-morbidities is more important than the syndrome of CHF per
_se. In other cases, undertreatment of the CHF condition may be_
an explanation. Despite the participating patients being regarded as


‘optimally treated’ by their physician before inclusion in the study, a
number of patients had their medications re-evaluated, up-titrated,
and rigorously checked according to optimal evidence-based therapy for CHF. Nevertheless, the impact of physiological, psychosocial, and spiritual problems should be recognized. The continuity
of the team, accessibility, and the possibility of visits and examinations at patients’ homes are important measures for lessening the
patient’s total symptom burden. The confidence, availability, and
trust in the PREFER team may have had a substantial impact on
patients’ HRQL and need for hospital care. Also, the involvement of
a wife or husband and other relatives may be important.[30] A number of explanations are possible as the PREFER concept involves
different strategies involving specialist competences from different
areas: general practitioners and doctors trained in palliative care,
cardiologists, nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists.
We consider that the PCC has had a substantial impact on the
results. One of the main differences between the two strategies
was the nurse visits at the patient’s home, which were substantially
and significantly more frequent in the PREFER group compared
with the usual care group. This made it possible to carry out the
structured, PCC at home. Moreover, besides the updating of drug
treatment according to recent guidelines both for drug treatment
and device therapy, we hypothesize that the continuity of the same
personnel, being a rather small group, was of importance. The possibility for the patients to reach the personnel easily by phone and
that treatment often could take place at the patient’s home instead
of them being admitted to hospital may have contributed to the
achieved results. These steps of the PREFER concept may have created confidence in and reassurance by the care given and reduced
patients’ anxiety.
Further research is needed to evaluate the separate impact
of each component of the PREFER concept, if possible, and its
contribution to the beneficial effects found in the present study.

##### Limitations


Our findings have a number of limitations. First, patients in the
PREFER group were significantly older than those in the control
group, but this difference was adjusted for in the follow-up analyses.
Secondly, the outcome analyses were not blinded; functional class
was evaluated by physicians involved in the trial. Questionnaires
were filled out by participating patients who knew the group to
which they belonged. This may have introduced some bias into
the symptom reporting and assessment of NYHA classes. Thirdly,
this study was small and at a single centre, which should be
considered when interpreting and generalizing the study findings.
Although the number of patients was limited, a strength of this
study was that we included patients with a high number of severe
co-morbidities that are seldom accepted in most randomized
clinical trials. The exclusion criteria were mostly for practical or
administrative reasons, so we consider the patients in this study to
be representative of many elderly patients with moderate to severe
CHF treated in hospitals and primary healthcare.

## Conclusion

Patient-centred care seemed to relieve the physical, physiological,
social, and spiritual problems of patients with severe CHF by
improving HRQL, functional class, and total symptom burden, and
reduced hospitalizations and the number of days spent in hospital.
Our findings also challenge the traditional way of caring for elderly
patients with CHF and accompanying co-morbidities.
