### Summary
**Background** **Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom, which increases in many diseases as they progress**
**and is diffi cult to manage.** **We assessed the eff ectiveness of early palliative care integrated with respiratory services for**
**patients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness.**

**Methods** **In this single-blind randomised trial, we enrolled consecutive adults with refractory breathlessness and**
**advanced disease from three large teaching hospitals and via general practitioners in South London.** **We randomly**
**allocated (1:1) patients to receive either a breathlessness support service or usual care. Randomisation was computer**
**generated centrally by the independent Clinical Trials Unit in a 1:1 ratio, by minimisation to balance four potential**
**confounders: cancer versus non-cancer, breathlessness severity, presence of an informal caregiver, and ethnicity. The**
**breathlessness support service was a short-term, single point of access service integrating palliative care, respiratory**
**medicine, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. Research interviewers were masked as to which patients were in**
**the treatment group. Our primary outcome was patient-reported breathlessness mastery, a quality of life domain in**
**the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, at 6 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat.** **Survival was a**
**safety endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01165034.**

**Findings** **Between Oct 22, 2010** **and Sept 28, 2012, 105 consenting patients were randomly assigned (53 to breathlessness**
**support service and 52 to usual care). 83 of 105 (78%) patients completed the assessment at week 6. Mastery in the**
**breathlessness support service group improved compared with the control (mean diff erence 0∙58, 95% CI 0∙01–1∙15,**
**p=0∙048; eff ect size 0∙44). Sensitivity analysis found similar results. Survival rate from randomisation to 6 months**
**was better in the breathlessness support service group than in the control group (50 of 53 [94%] vs 39 of 52 [75%]) and**
**in overall survival (generalised Wilcoxon 3·90, p=0∙048). Survival diff erences were signifi cant for patients with**
**chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease but not cancer.**

**Interpretation** **The breathlessness support service improved breathlessness mastery. Our fi ndings provide robust**
**evidence to support the early integration of palliative care for patients with diseases other than cancer and**
**breathlessness as well as those with cancer. The improvement in survival requires further investigation.**

### Introduction
Breathlessness is a common and distressing symptom in
many advanced chronic diseases, causing considerable
disability, anxiety, and social isolation.[1–3] Worldwide, more
than 75 million people have breathlessness every year,
including more than 90% of the 65 million people with
severe lung disease,[4] more than 50% of the 10 million with
incurable cancer, and 50% of the 23 million with heart
failure.[5,6] Breathlessness increases as the disease
progresses,[7] is frightening for patients and families, and
often results in emergency hospital admission because it
is accompanied by feelings of loss of mastery over
breathing and panic.[7, 8]

Once treatment of the underlying disease is optimised,
breathlessness that continues is deemed refractory.[1]
Patients with refractory breathlessness in advanced


disease have many symptoms and concerns that are
complex and interact; consequently palliative care has
been recommended.[4,9] In this study, we developed and
assessed a new short-term breathlessness support service.
This provided one point of access for patients, brought
together palliative care and respiratory medicine, and
responded to the call for shared care at an earlier stage in
disease than usual.[10,11] We hypothesised that patients
attending the breathlessness support service, compared
with those receiving standard care, would have better
mastery of breathlessness at 6 weeks.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
This trial was a randomised controlled, parallel group,
pragmatic single-blind fast-track trial in South London

#### Randomisation and masking
Using data from the baseline interview, the King’s Clinical
Trials Unit’s Online randomisation system, independent
of research and clinical teams, randomly assigned (1:1)
patients to the intervention (immediate access to
breathlessness support service in addition to standard
care) or control group (standard best practice; off ered
breathlessness support service after 6 weeks). Allocation
was done by minimisation[13] to balance four potential
confounders: cancer versus non-cancer, breathlessness
severity (numerical rating scale >3 or not), presence (or
not) of an informal caregiver, and ethnic origin (white or
other). After randomisation, the clinical trials unit team
informed the breathlessness support service clinic
administrator of the patient’s study group via secure email,
who then arranged clinic appointments accordingly.
Research nurses and interviewers were masked to
treatment allocation. Patients were aware of treatment
allocation, and were asked not to disclose this information
to interviewers or research nurses. The trial coordinator
and the trial administrator were aware of treatment
allocation; the coordinator informed the research nurses
when, and with whom, they had to do interviews.

#### Procedures
The breathlessness support service is an additional service
to usual UK National Health Service (NHS) care. It is a
multi-professional integrated service that combines
respiratory, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and
palliative care assessment and management. It brings
together assessment and treatment of physical, emotional,
psychological, and spiritual concerns, through one point of
access. The service comprises (appendix pp 1–2) a fi rst
outpatient clinic appointment with respiratory medicine
and palliative care clinicians assessing present treatment
and concerns. The patient (and family if present) is given a
breathlessness pack including information, management,
and pacing guidance, a hand-held fan or water spray, and a
poem (a short mantra to help breathing and relaxation
during crises) and helped to agree a crisis plan. A home
assessment is done 2–3 weeks after the clinic visit by a
physiotherapist and/or occupational therapist to assess the
need for walking and home aids and adaptations,
reinforcement of self-management, and further guidance
on pacing and exercises, including a DVD when
appropriate. 4 weeks after the fi rst clinic visit, a second and
fi nal clinic appointment with a palliative care specialist is
arranged to agree further actions and a discharge plan.
Service modelling for the breathlessness support service
is built on the nurse-led clinic, developed by Bredin and
colleagues[14] and the palliative care and physiotherapy
approach developed by Booth and colleagues,[15] and
systematic reviews,[16] qualitative interviews,[2] crosssectional[9,17] and longitudinal studies,[18] and consultation
with local stakeholders.[12] These data suggested that
breathlessness support services should provide one point
of access integrate palliative care with existing services

UK, recruiting patients between Oct 22, 2010 and
Sept 28, 2012. We screened for potential patients across
three large teaching hospitals and via general
practitioners.
Patients were included according to a standard
proforma completed by the identifying clinician.
Patients had to meet all criteria: refractory breathlessness
on exertion or rest (MRC dyspnoea scale score ≥2),
despite optimum treatment of the underlying disease,
as deemed by the identifying clinician; advanced disease
such as cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), chronic heart failure, interstitial lung disease,
and motor neuron disease; willing to engage with shortterm home physiotherapy and occupational therapy;
and able to provide informed consent. Patients were
excluded for any of the following: breathlessness of
unknown cause; a primary diagnosis of chronic
hyperventilation syndrome; completely house (or
hospital or nursing home) bound, despite off er of free
transport to clinic; or within 2 weeks of treatment for an
acute exacerbation. Such patients were reapproached
after 2 weeks.
Protocol, procedures, information sheets, consent
forms, and questionnaires were approved through the
inde pendent UK Integrated Research Approval System
via the ethics committee at King’s College Hospital
(Ref. 10/H0808/17). We then applied for and were
granted NHS Research and Development approval in
all recruiting sites. Patients gave written informed
consent before enrolment. Our protocol[12] followed
CONSORT recommendations. There were no protocol
deviations.


**_Panel 1: Outcome, quality of life and health-care use assessments_**

- Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, a 20-item validated health-related quality
of life questionnaire in which experiences are rated on seven-point scales ranging 1
(maximum impairment) to 7 (no impairment)[19,20]

- Severity of breathlessness in the previous 24 h on a 0–10 numerical rating scale
(NRS), average, at rest, and on exertion[12]

- London Chest Activity of Daily Living, a questionnaire of the level of disability induced by
breathlessness for 15 activities (in four areas: personal care, domestic, physical, and
social); each activity is scored 0–5 (0=I wouldn’t do it anyway, 5=someone else needs to
carry out the activity)[12]

- EQ-5D and EQ-VAS which assess mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or
discomfort, anxiety or depression according to three levels of severity (1=no problems,
2=some or moderate problems, and 3=extreme problems), plus a Visual Analogue
Scale (VAS) of present health-related quality of life, scored 0–100[12]

- Palliative care Outcome Scale, a ten-item measure for advanced disease widely
validated in cancer and non-cancer; each item is rated 0 (no problem) to
4 (overwhelming problem)[21]

- Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a 14-item measure of psychological
distress with separate anxiety and depression subscales[12]

- Client Services Receipt Inventory (CSRI)[12] in which patients reported the health,
voluntary, and social care services received over the past 3 months, or if follow-up
since the last research interview[12]

off er outpatient and home contact, and focus on improving
patient self-management.
Patients randomly assigned to the control group
continued with optimum management as provided by
their usual services in accordance with relevant UK
guidance to ensure best practice (appendix pp 3–5). After
the 6 week (primary endpoint) research interview, these
patients were off ered the breathlessness support service.
Study measurements included the Chronic Respiratory
Disease Questionnaire, severity of breathlessness in the
previous 24 h, the London Chest Activity of Daily Living
questionnaire, EQ-5D and EQ-VAS, the Palliative care
Outcome Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS), and the Client Services Receipt Inventory
(panel 1). These measurements were collected in a
standard questionnaire booklet consisting of demographic,
clinical, outcome assessments, and use of health-care
services. Research data were collected in face to face
interviews with patients, usually in their own homes, at
baseline and 6 weeks follow-up (the primary endpoint). In
addition face to face qualitative interviews were conducted
after the trial was completed.
At baseline and 6 weeks follow-up, interviewers
measured pulmonary function and oxygen saturation with
a portable spirometer and fi nger pulse oximeter.

#### Outcomes
The primary outcome was breathlessness mastery at
6 weeks as recorded in the 6 week face to face interview,
determined according to one domain of the quality of life
measure, the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire[12,19]
(panel 1). Mastery is the average of four questions about
the feeling of control over the disease and its eff ects on
quality of life and function (range=1 [maximum
impairment] to 7 [no impairment]). Secondary outcomes
included: severity of breathlessness on exertion in the
previous 24 h, activity (assessed by London Chest Activity
of Daily Living questionnaire), other domains of the
Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (breathlessness, fatigue, and emotional function), quality of life (EQ5D), palliative needs (assessed by Palliative care Outcome
Scale), depression and anxiety (measured by the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), and spirometry.
Patient survival (since randomisation) was planned to be
calculated from dropout and missing data, with exact dates
extracted from clinical records, as a safety secondary
endpoint, as recommended in clinical trials.[22 ] We also
planned to collect and analyse caregiver burden data. But it
proved diffi cult to contact lay caregivers for consent
because many used the research nurse visit as an
opportunity to go out while someone was with the patient.
Only 11 caregivers were interviewed at baseline and only
four at 6 week follow-up. Therefore these data were not
analysed further.
20 patients were purposefully selected for qualitative
interviews, after completing the trial, to include a mix of
ages sex diagnoses and presence of caregiver The


**_Figure 1: Trial profi le_**
*Our biggest loss before consent was the 47 individuals (21·8% of 216 referred to the trial, and 42·3% of those not
consented and randomly assigned) whom we were unable to contact. Appendix p 9 shows the eff orts made to
contact people.

interviews were semi-structured and followed a topic
guide on patients’ expectations, experiences, and views
about the content, format, and eff ect of the breathlessness
support service. Questions were open-ended and not
based on pre-existing theory. Interviews were taperecorded and transcribed verbatim.

#### Statistical analysis
On the basis of our primary outcome, the Chronic
Respiratory Disease Questionnaire mastery domain, we
estimated that more than 34 patients per group would
detect a mean diff erence of 0∙70 (SD 1), a p value of less
than 0∙05 at power 80%.[19,20] To allow for a conservative
estimated attrition of 40% we planned to recruit at least
110 patients into the study.
All randomly assigned participants were included in
the intention-to-treat analysis. Missing data were explored
according to cause.[23] Continuous variables, expressed as
means and standard deviations, were compared with the
Student’s t test. Categorical variables were compared with
χ² test or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate As

prespecifi ed, we used independent samples Student’s _t_
test to compare patient mastery (primary outcome) and
secondary outcomes at 6 weeks, by trial group. Sensitivity
analysis explored the robustness of results: fi rst,
accounting for diff erences in patient diagnoses and
baseline scores using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA);
second, with multiple imputations of missing data;[23] and
third with pre-post analysis of breathlessness support
service and control groups.
Survival was calculated from date of randomisation to
date of death and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Patients who were still alive on Sept 1, 2013, after the last
patient was recruited were censored at this date. We
calculated the survival rates to 180 days (6 months) from
consent in both groups. With all data to 1 year from last
recruitment, we assessed overall survival diff erence
between two groups with the generalised Wilcoxon
(Breslow) test, which is more sensitive in the detection of
early diff erences in survival,[24] which is important in the
fast-track or wait-list design.
We calculated costs by combining Client Service
Receipt Inventory data with UK 2011–12 unit costs.[25] Cost
data are usually skewed; therefore, we used a bootstrapped
regression model to produce confi dence intervals.
Statistical signifi cance was accepted for p values less
than 0∙05.
Qualitative interviews were imported into NVivo version
7 and content analysis explored patients’ own views and
experiences of the breathlessness support service, and in
particular how issues related to the primary and secondary
outcomes. We created categories inductively, with attention
to terms and content, from the interview data. Through a
process of constant integration of categories and their
properties, or constant comparison, the fi ndings became
relevant at a more abstract level. We used simple counting
when possible to discover more defi nite patterns in views.
Member checks and teamwork were used to establish
credibility.
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT01165034.

### Results
Between Oct 22, 2010, and Sept 28, 2012, we screened
216 eligible patients. 105 consented and were randomly
assigned (fi gure 1). Participants were identifi ed from
respiratory medicine (50 [48%]), palliative care services
(23 [22%]), general practices (15 [14%]), physiotherapy
services (13 [12%]), and heart failure services (four [4%]).
The median time to fi rst clinic appointment was 19 days,
some patients were delayed beyond this because of health

problems or hospital admissions. Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics. Patients had severe disease:
forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was 46% predicted,
vital capacity 58% predicted, oxygen saturation (SaO2 %) at
rest 93%, average breathlessness 5∙9/10, on exertion
8∙3/10. Their average Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire
breathlessness mastery was 3∙4. Their average total
Palliative care Outcome Score was 15/40, indicating
important unmet palliative care concerns; for the HADS,
the mean scores were 9 for anxiety and 10 for depression,
both above the cutoff for clinical signifi cance.
At week 6, 82 of 105 (78%) patients completed
assessments. The main reasons for attrition were illness
or death (fi gure 1). Attrition to the primary outcome was
slightly lower than estimated (22% not 40%); therefore,
we agreed to stop recruitment after 105 patients had
consented. Missing data, death, and dropout were not
associated with baseline mastery score, FEV1 or other
key variables except oxygen saturation (appendix p 7).
Four patients died by week 6, two had cancer (one in
breathlessness support service group), and two had
interstitial lung disease (both in control group).
We recorded a signifi cant improvement in the primary
outcome, the mastery domain of the Chronic Respiratory
Disease Questionnaire, in the breathlessness support
service group compared with the control group at 6 weeks
(table 2). Patients receiving the breathlessness support
service had on average a 16% improvement for
breathlessness mastery over the control group (mean
diff erence 0·58, eff ect size 0·44, control group mean
score 3·57). Results were similar to those from our
sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome: ANCOVA
adjusted for diagnosis, p=0∙037; ANCOVA adjusted for
diagnosis and baseline score, p=0∙05; multiple
imputation (number of imputations 45) based on
baseline score of the measure of interest, p=0∙07;
adjusted for baseline score, diagnosis, FEV1, SaO2 %,
p=0∙072; control and intervention groups were imputed
separately. In further post-hoc sensitivity analyses, fi rst
excluding patients referred or identifi ed via palliative
care services, and second excluding those with cancer
(because of potential bias of palliative care eff ect), we
noted 6 week mean mastery scores of, respectively, 4·18
(SD 1·2) in the intervention group and 3·54 (1·4) in the
control group (p=0·043) and 4·19 (1·2) in the intervention
group and 3·52 (1·3) in the control group (p=0·033).
We noted no signifi cant diff erences in patient-reported
secondary outcomes between study groups at 6 weeks
(table 2). For all items, except anxiety, the breathlessness
support service group had better scores than the control
group; this was largest, but not signifi cant, for the London
Chest Activity of Daily Living questionnaire and
breathlessness on exertion. Findings of pre-post analysis
within groups (appendix p 8) showed signifi cant improvements in the breathlessness support service group
between baseline and 6 weeks for seven outcomes:
mastery total quality of life score dyspnoea and emotion


assessed by Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire,
average breathlessness per 24 h, on exertion breathlessness
per 24 h, and Palliative care Outcome Scale total score. No
outcome showed deterioration. The control group had a
signifi cant improvement between baseline and 6 weeks
for only Palliative care Outcome Scale total score, and
signifi cant deteriorations for London Chest Activity of
Daily Living questionnaire and HADS.
We noted a signifi cant diff erence in survival for the
whole sample that appeared early after randomisation
(generalised Wilcoxon 3·90, p=0∙048). Survival was
similar between the study arms for patients with cancer,
but signifi cantly diff erent for patients without cancer:
all 42 patients without cancer in the breathlessness
support service group were alive through to 6 months
(180 days), of the 42 control patients without cancer at
baseline, 38 were alive at 90 days, and 32 at 180 days
(table 3 and fi gure 2). The standard care group received
the breathlessness support service by 120 days


-----

**_Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival according to study group_**
Survival was calculated from the time of randomisation to the time of death, if death occurred during the study
period, or to the time of censoring (Sept 1, 2013). Median days between randomisation to Sept 1, 2013, was
745 (range 338–1075) for the breathlessness support service group and 711 (345–1045) for the control group.
Tick marks show censoring of data. Overall generalised Wilcoxon (Breslow) was 3·90, p=0·048. In subgroup
analysis, this pattern was not recorded for patients with cancer (0·01, p=0·97; n=21); but it became more marked
for patients with diseases other than cancer (6·04, p=0·01; n=84). The pattern was recorded for patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and separately in those with interstitial lung disease, although numbers are
small for those with interstitial lung disease.

At 6 weeks, we noted no signifi cant diff erences between
total formal care costs in the two groups. 6 week mean
costs were £1422 in the breathlessness support service
group (bootstrapped 95% CI 897–2101) and £1408 in the
control group (899–2023). Costs varied greatly between
individuals


Improved knowledge, confi dence, and insight into how
to function despite breathlessness were identifi ed as
potential mechanisms in the qualitative analysis through
which the breathlessness support service improved
patient mastery (appendix pp 10–11).

### Discussion
This is the fi rst randomised trial of a breathlessness
support service integrating palliative care and respiratory
medicine, and the fi rst powered trial to test early integrated
palliative care including patients without cancer (panel 2).
The breathlessness support service integrated respiratory
medicine, palliative care, physiotherapy, and occupational
therapy for patients with advanced conditions and
refractory breathlessness. The service responds to calls for
earlier integration of palliative care including for patients
without cancer.[10] At 6 weeks, the primary outcome,
breathlessness mastery, improved more in the
breathlessness support service group than in the standard
care group. Qualitative data provided evidence of the
breathlessness support service improving confi dence,
function, and control over breathlessness. No secondary
patient-reported outcomes were signifi cantly diff erent
between groups, although there was evidence in the prepost analysis that the breathlessness support service group
had improved activities of daily living and reduced
breathlessness on exertion and depression. We recorded
no harms of the breathlessness support service. The
number of inpatient bed days and total formal care costs,
on the basis of patient-reported total service use, were
similar between groups.
Refractory breathlessness is a diffi cult clinical problem,
usually the second most common symptom after pain in
patients with advanced chronic disease, with high costs
for society.[3] Oxygen has a role for individuals with severe
hypoxaemia at rest or exercise desaturation, but is of little
symptomatic value when patients are not hypoxic.[39] Lowdose, sustained-release opioids safely reduce breath lessness without respiratory depression,[40] but no other
eff ective drugs exist.[1,3,41] Non-pharmacological treatments
(eg, rollator devices, fan therapy, breathing control, and
muscle strengthening) can provide benefi ts[16 ] as can
multidisciplinary rehabilitation programmes, but in
advanced disease, many patients are unable to attend or
benefi t.[16,34 ]In this context, palliative care can have a role
(panel 2), but robust trials are scarce.
Although the fi nding of improved mastery in patients
in the breathlessness support service group might not be
surprising, this service (integrated palliative and
respiratory care) is not standard, and usual care did not
achieve the same result. All patients had advanced and
deteriorating disease, in the palliative phase of a
progressive illness, in which breathlessness progressively
increases up to death. Therefore, the fi nding of little
change in our secondary outcomes is not surprising,
especially ones such as spirometry. These data suggest
that we included an appropriate group of patients


-----

The American Thoracic Society defi nes breathlessness
as “a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that
consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in
intensity”.[3] Like pain, breathlessness is a subjective
experience resulting from complex interactions between
pathological, physiological, and emotional elements.
Therefore, it is diffi cult to choose the correct outcome to
measure in breathlessness trials. We chose a well
established quality of life measure’s mastery domain,
rather than levels of breathlessness, for several reasons.
First, ratings of breathlessness levels are very variable
and patients can have breathlessness attacks several
times a day without constant breathlessness. Therefore,
helping these patients to master their attacks might be
more important than reducing the severity of one attack.
Second, breathlessness is a limited endpoint because
people perform activity to the highest level of
breathlessness they can bear, but hope to do more before
they reach that point. Breathlessness support services
aimed to support and provide patients with coping
strategies and interventions to help them master their
breathlessness, while accepting that the disease cannot
be cured and its natural history changed. Thus, the
amount of perceived breathlessness mastery is probably
a more important component of quality of life than is
amount of breathlessness. As the qualitative results
suggest, patients found this point important.
We found a diff erence in survival between study
groups; patients in the control group had poorer survival
in the early period of the study compared with patients
in the breathlessness support service group. This
diff erence was not found for patients with cancer, but
was signifi cant for patients with diseases other than
cancer, mostly in those with COPD and interstitial lung
disease. We do not have reliable data for the longevity of
the disease or prognosis before randomisation, which
limits interpretation of this fi nding. However, our
results support another trial of early palliative care,[31]
although we are the fi rst to fi nd a survival diff erence for
patients with diseases other than cancer. Therefore,
these results need further exploration and testing in
future trials, as does the optimum timing of the
breathlessness support service.
The breathlessness support service had some similar
components to the breathlessness intervention service
developed in Cambridge, UK in the late 2000s,[15] including
one point of entry, integration of palliative care with
physiotherapy, some specifi c interventions, and
education. However, there are diff erences between the
services; we included assessment by respiratory medicine
(a component valued by patients in the qualitative
interviews), asked patients to attend outpatient clinics
(the breathlessness intervention service is home based),
and used the poem for crisis management.
Our study has limitations. We were only able to single
mask the groups. Our primary outcome measure was
subjective; patients who knew their study group could


**_Panel 2: Research in context_**

**Systematic review**
In the past 4 years there have been calls for early integration of palliative care to support
patients with advanced disease.[10,11] We searched the scientifi c literature for evidence by
extending three systematic reviews and one narrative review that assessed early palliative
care in hospitals and at home.[26–30] We updated their search terms and also searched for any
studies with the keywords: palliative, integration, and early. Additionally, we searched for
trials of service interventions for patients with breathlessness (or dyspnoea or dyspnea) in
advanced diseases (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] or interstitial lung
disease or heart failure or cancer) and on refractory breathlessness. Although many
qualitative and descriptive studies have been done, we identifi ed only four trials of early
palliative care; three of these for patients with cancer. Temel and colleagues[31] and Bakitas
and colleagues[32] found early palliative care signifi cantly improved quality of life; the recent
Zimmermann and coworkers trial[28] found similar benefi ts. In non-cancer, there is one
published phase 2 trial of early palliative care in patients with multiple sclerosis, which
suggested early integrated palliative care improved symptom control.[33] Although many
interventions and services have been proposed to help patients with chronic
breathlessness, such as pulmonary rehabilitation,[34] and national initiatives such as
IMPRESS aimed at the development of integrated population-based approaches to
prevent, detect, and care for people aff ected by COPD,[35] there are few for patients with the
more advanced stages of illness or refractory breathlessness. We identifi ed two
randomised trials, one in progress. Bredin and colleagues[14] tested a nurse-led clinic for
patients with lung cancer, not palliative care. A coauthor of this study, Booth, did
observational work[15] and is currently trialling a community-based palliative care and
physiotherapy service, the breathlessness intervention service, but this does not have
out-patient clinics or include respiratory medicine.[36] In Canada, Rocker and Cook[37]
developed the INSPIRED model of care for patients with advanced COPD to off er a more
integrated approach to care, with personalised action plans, advance care planning, and
palliative treatments. We could fi nd no randomised trials of INSPIRED but observational
data suggest the model reduces repeat admissions and is welcomed by patients. Horton
and colleagues[38] did an observational study to test the feasibility of home-based palliative
care for patients and caregivers living with advanced COPD (30 patients enrolled and
13 provided outcome assessments).

**Interpretation**
In this randomised controlled trial of 105 patients with refractory breathlessness, we
noted that patients who received an integrated palliative care and respiratory
breathlessness support service had signifi cantly improved breathlessness mastery at
6 weeks. Mastery assessed patients’ feeling of control over their breathlessness and its
eff ects on quality of life and function, and was on average 16% higher for those patients
receiving the breathlessness support service. The breathlessness support service did not
show a signifi cant advantage for other secondary outcomes, although there was a
tendency for improvement in the ability to undertake activities of daily living, lesser
depression, and lower breathlessness on exertion. Our fi ndings were supported by
qualitative data. We did not fi nd a diff erence in formal care costs. Like Temel and
colleagues’ trial,[31] survival was better for the group receiving early breathlessness support
service than the control group, although in this instance for patients with diseases other
than cancer. In both these studies, survival was a secondary outcome, which suggests
further research is needed. Our study supports the early integration of palliative care with
respiratory medicine in non-cancer (eg, COPD, interstitial lung disease, and heart failure),
focused on a group with refractory breathlessness. By being based mainly in outpatient
settings and for a short term, the breathlessness support service meets the Block and
Billings criteria of being scalable.[11] As our trial was of one service, we suggest that the
breathlessness support service warrants testing in multicentre randomised trials, and
further studies comparing diff erent models and the timing of integration are needed.

have been subject to the placebo eff ect. However,
participants were unaware that mastery was an
endpoint because it was not emphasised in interviews
and relevant questions were dispersed within the
questionnaire. Additionally, the research nurse could
have seen breathlessness support service equipment
(eg, hand-held fan and information sheets) in the
home, which could have biased their interviews. Our
inclusion and exclusion criteria prevented extrapolation
of study results to patients in the last month of life.
Further, our outcome follow-up was short because of
the fast-track nature of the trial. Although this short
follow-up gave us acceptability from referrers and
patients, it restricted our assessments, especially of
care costs and long-term survival; the trial was not
designed specifi cally to test for survival. We recruited
from a small number of sites in urban areas where
usual care at specialist centres was probably of an
unusually good standard, with expert staff who were
motivated to take part in this research. We were unable
to contact more than a fi fth of patients screened and
eligible for the study, and could not pursue this further
because of data protection and ethics approval
requirements. Therefore, we do not know how our
recorded eff ects translate to other routine scenarios and
settings. Some patients were identifi ed via palliative
care services, which might have aff ected our results;
however, the diff erence in our primary outcome
remained when these eff ects were excluded.
Our primary outcome had an eff ect size of 0·44,
smaller than that proposed in our sample size calculation.
Puhan and colleagues[20] recommended an eff ect size of
0·7 for patient self-administered and 0·38 for intervieweradministered questionnaires. We fi nd it surprising that a
diff erence in interviewer should make such a diff erence
in eff ect size, although this might be related to less
variation in interviewer-administered formats. However,
perhaps we should have used the more conservative
0·38 in our sample size estimation.
This trial provides support for a more integrated
approach to management of breathlessness within a
breathlessness support service, which improves patient
mastery without aff ecting overall care costs. The recorded
improvement in survival needs further investigation.
The breathlessness support service needs testing in
multicentre, longer term trials including a wider range of
urban and rural settings.
