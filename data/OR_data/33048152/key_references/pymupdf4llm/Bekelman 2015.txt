eart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of disability,
hospitalization, and death in the Veterans Affairs (VA)
system and the United States as a whole.[1,2] It has a ma
# H

jor effect on patients’ health status, defined as their symptom burden, functional status, and health-related quality of
life. To date, few HF interventions have specifically targeted
these critical patient-centered outcomes.[2-4]

Disease management, variously defined,[5] has been promoted as a strategy to improve outcomes of patients with HF.
Itusuallyreferstomultidisciplinaryeffortstoimprovethequality and cost-effectiveness of care for selected patients with
chronic conditions. These programs involve interventions designed to improve adherence to scientific guidelines and treatment plans.[6] However, the association between HF disease
management and outcomes is inconsistent.[4,7-12] Heart failure
disease management interventions have often relied solely on
nurse case management.
We developed the Patient-Centered Disease Management (PCDM) intervention to address these shortcomings by
combining multidisciplinary collaborative care, home telemonitoring, and depression management. Multidisciplinary collaborativecarehasbeenshowntobeeffectiveindiabetesmellitus,hypertension,lipidlevel,anddepressionmanagement.[13,14]

Hometelemonitoringinisolationhasnotimprovedoutcomes.[15]

However, integrating home telemonitoring with multidisciplinarycollaborativecareteammanagementmayimproveoutcomes through the provision of actionable, guideline-based
treatmentrecommendationstailoredtoindividualpatients.To
date, no studies have targeted improving patient health status as a primary outcome or addressed key barriers such as comorbid depression. It is important to assess and manage depression in HF because depression is associated with poor
treatment adherence, health status, and other outcomes.[4,16,17]

Finally, to our knowledge, the effectiveness of disease management for HF has not previously been evaluated in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated health care
system in the United States.
The multisite PCDM trial evaluated the combination of
multidisciplinary collaborative care, telemonitoring, and joint
HF and depression management. The primary aim was to determine whether the intervention resulted in better patient
healthstatus(ie,symptomburden,functionalstatus,andquality of life) than usual care. The secondary aims were to determine whether the disease management intervention resulted in reduced hospitalizations, depressive symptoms, or
mortality.

### Methods

#### Setting and Population
The methods of the PCDM trial have been previously
described.[18] The study was conducted at the VA medical centers in Denver, Colorado, Palo Alto, California, Richmond, Virginia,andSeattle,Washington,aswellasattheiraffiliatedcommunity-based outpatient clinics. All patients with an assigned
VA primary care physician and at least 1 primary care visit during the prior 12 months with a HF diagnosis code in the VA elec

tronic health record were screened for eligibility to participate. Following previously described case finding methods,[19]

the study was designed to target all patients with a diagnosis
of HF, irrespective of the type of HF (eg, including those with
andwithoutpreservedleftventricularsystolicfunction).Therefore, the diagnosis of HF was defined as meeting any 1 of the
following 5 criteria: (1) a primary inpatient hospital discharge
diagnosis of HF (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
_Revision [ICD-9] code 428.XX); (2) at least 2 secondary inpa-_
tient hospital discharge diagnoses of HF (ICD-9 codes 428.XX)
and a primary inpatient hospital discharge diagnosis related
to heart disease (ICD-9 codes 410.XX, 412.XX, 413.XX, and
414.XX); (3) at least 3 secondary inpatient hospital discharge
diagnosis codes related to HF; (4) at least 2 outpatient visit diagnoses of HF, excluding emergency department visits; and
(5) at least 2 secondary inpatient hospital discharge diagnoses of HF and at least 1 outpatient HF diagnosis.[19]

Potentially eligible patients were screened with the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) to identify patients with a diagnosis of HF and reduced health status. Individualsscoringlessthan60ontheKCCQoverallsummaryscore
(indicating significant HF symptoms, limited functional status, and poor quality of life) were invited to an enrollment visit
if they did not have any exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria
were (1) severe cognitive or psychiatric impairment; (2) current residence in a nursing home; (3) irreversible, noncardiac
medical conditions likely to affect 6-month survival or ability
to execute the study protocol (eg, metastatic cancer); (4) prior
heart transplantation; and (5) alcohol abuse as indicated by the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test[20] score of at least 7.
At enrollment, eligible patients provided written informed consent, completed baseline survey measures, and
were then randomized to the PCDM intervention or to usual
care. The study database was used to create the randomization sequence using block randomization, with stratification
by study site and 1:1 randomization of patients to the intervention and to usual care. The randomization sequence was
concealed from the study personnel. Randomization occurred after baseline survey information was entered into the
database. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at each of the study sites. The full study protocol
can be found in the trial protocol in the Supplement.

#### PCDM Intervention
The intervention included 3 components. These were multidisciplinarycollaborativecareHFdiseasemanagement,screening for and treatment of depression, and telemonitoring with
patient self-care support.

Collaborative Care
Each site had a collaborative care team consisting of a nurse
coordinator (registered nurse), a primary care physician, a
cardiologist, and a psychiatrist. For each intervention patient,
the team reviewed the electronic health record and baseline
depression scores from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9
(PHQ-9). The team recommended care changes for a given
patient in accord with the American College of Cardiology
and American Heart Association Guidelines for the Diagnosis


-----

and Management of Heart Failure in Adults[21] and the collaborative depression care intervention as described herein. In
addition, the team met weekly to recommend care changes
based on review of telemonitoring data and the follow-up
PHQ-9 scores. Collaborative care team recommendations
were entered into a progress note and written as unsigned
orders in the electronic medical record for review and signature by the patient’s primary care physician. This method
was successfully used in a prior VA intervention study[22] for
angina, with a high rate of acceptance of the recommendations by VA primary care physicians.

Screening and Treatment of Depression
Intervention patients who screened positive for depression
(PHQ-9 score, ≥10) received the depression care component
of the intervention, adapted from a successful collaborative
depression care intervention.[23] This included (1) up to 11 sessions of behavioral activation and antidepressant management, provided by the nurse coordinator and supervised by
the team psychiatrist; (2) a depression educational video;
and (3) depression assessment and self-management education via telemonitoring. Before enrollment began, the nurse
coordinator from each site participated in a 2-day training on
depression and behavioral activation by the lead study psychiatrist (M.D.S.) and 4 weekly follow-up calls with the lead
study psychiatrist. Thereafter, the nurse was supervised by
the site psychiatrist via as-needed calls with the lead psychiatrist and Dr Bekelman. The depression care component
of the nurse intervention was standardized in a treatment
manual that described detailed procedures for what to discuss with patients.

Telehealth Telemonitoring and Patient Self-care Support
Intervention patients received daily telemonitoring using
home-based equipment that tracked signs and symptoms of
HF and depression. The system collected daily measures of
bloodpressure,pulse,weight,andself-reportedsymptoms(eg,
shortness of breath and edema). Patients with depression were
asked questions about their mood and behavior. The telemonitoring system assigned a risk to each response on the system. The nurse reviewed medium risk indicators and decided whether an action needed to be taken (eg, for patients
unable to understand a low sodium diet, the nurse provided
counseling). The nurse acted on all of the high risk indicators
by contacting the patient for assessment and then, if necessary, contacted the care team for any changes in medications
or tests to be written in the electronic medical record. For example, the collaborative care team could set and change an individual patient’s dry weight and recommend a diuretic dosing guideline to primary care physicians.
The self-care programs included medication reminders to
promoteadherence,educationaboutHFanddepression,medicationmonitoring,anddietaryadvice.Patientsweretaughtthe
importance of daily self-weighing, adherence to a low sodium diet and medication regimens, and recognition of early
signs and symptoms of HF decompensation. Adherence of
nurses and the collaborative care team to the study protocol
was not formally measured.


#### Usual Care
Patients randomized to the usual care arm continued to receivecarefromtheirregularhealthcareprofessionalsandregular telehealth nurses (if enrolled in telemonitoring), with no
involvement of the study collaborative care team. Care was
fully at the discretion of the patient’s regular health care professionals and may or may not have included cardiology or
mentalhealthcliniccareinadditiontoprimarycare.Usualcare
patients were given information sheets at the enrollment visit
thatdescribedself-careforHFandwereprovidedwithaweighing scale if needed. Primary care physicians were notified if
usual care patients screened positive for depressive symptoms based on the initial study surveys. From then on, patients’ primary care physicians assumed responsibility for depression care.

#### Outcome Measures
The primary outcome, patient-reported HF-specific health status, was measured using the KCCQ. This questionnaire is valid,
reliable, and sensitive to clinical change and predicts hospitalizationandmortality.[24-26] Forthesecondarymeasures,depressionwasmeasuredusingthePHQ-9.Thisquestionnaireisavalid
and reliable instrument that provides a continuous measure of
depressive symptoms.[27] Baseline survey measures were collected in person. A research assistant (who was blinded to the
randomizationarm)collected3-monthand6-monthfollow-up
study outcome measures by phone or in person. The nurse coordinator collected measures at 12 months by phone or in person. Mortality and hospitalizations were assessed through VA
databases,supplementedbypatientself-report.Vitalstatuswas
also ascertained via the VA Vital Status File, which has a sensitivity of 98.3% and a specificity of 99.8% compared with the
National Death Index.[28]

#### Sample Size and Enrollment Targets
The primary hypothesis of this study was that patients with
HF receiving the PCDM intervention would have greater improvement in health status over a 12-month follow-up period
compared with those receiving usual care. The minimal clinically meaningful difference in the KCCQ overall summary
scores is 5 points,[26] and the SD of change in the KCCQ overall
summary scores was estimated to be 15 to 20 points based on
previous work.[25,26] With an estimated attrition rate of 30%, we
originally estimated that enrollment of 600 patients would
yieldgreaterthan80%powertodetectadifferenceintheKCCQ
overall summary scores of at least 5 points, assuming an SD of
18. A lower than expected enrollment was partially offset by a
greater than expected retention rate (attrition, <20%). The
KCCQ SD was 15 points. Hence, the study recruitment concluded with enrollment of 392 patients, with an estimated
greater than 80% power to detect a 5-point difference in the
KCCQ overall summary scores between groups.

#### Statistical Analysis
All primary and secondary analyses were conducted using an
intent-to-treat approach. Baseline characteristics of patients
were assessed by study group using t tests for continuous variables and χ[2] tests for categorical variables. For the primary out

come, change in the KCCQ overall summary scores from baseline to 1 year between the intervention and usual care groups
among patients who had both baseline and 1-year KCCQ overall summary scores was compared using a paired t test. In addition, a likelihood-based random-effects model was performedtocomparechangeintheKCCQoverallsummaryscores
over time between arms to account for missing data and longitudinaltrends.[29] Themagnitudeandpatternsofmissingdata
were analyzed to confirm the validity of model assumptions.
Model parameters were estimated using the MIXED procedure (SAS, version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc). Changes in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores) were analyzed among patients
who screened positive for depression (PHQ-9 score, ≥10) using
the same mixed modeling approach. The numbers of allcause hospitalizations and deaths at 12 months were com

pared between study arms using a χ[2] _t test. Log-rank tests were_
used to analyze time to death and time to hospitalization.

### Results

In total, 392 patients were randomized between May 2009 and
June 2011 (Figure 1). The study population was mostly male
(96.6%) and of white race/ethnicity (81.8%), with a mean age
of 68 years, typical of the US veteran population (Table 1). Participants had comorbidities common in HF, including diabetes mellitus (50.0%), prior myocardial infarction (40.6%),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (30.2%), and obstructivesleepapnea(43.8%).Thirty-eightpercenthadejectionfraction of less than 40%. At baseline, the mean KCCQ overall summary scores were 37.9 in the intervention group and 36.9 in the
usual care group (P = .48), indicating high symptom burden
and poor functional status and quality of life. Follow-up rates
were good, with primary outcome assessments completed in
89.8% (352 of 392) of participants at month 3, in 84.4% (331 of
392) of participants at month 6, and in 86.0% (337 of 392) of
participants at month 12.
The individual patient KCCQ overall summary score trajectories for patients in the intervention and usual care arms
over the study period are shown in Figure 2. After 1 year, the
mean KCCQ overall summary score had increased by 13.5
points for both the intervention and control groups (P = .97).
The intervention was not associated with greater improvement in the KCCQ overall summary scores when the effect
over time was estimated using the 3-month, 6-month, and
12-month data (P = .74). Model-estimated KCCQ overall summary scores in the intervention and usual care arms, respectively, were 43.8 (95% CI, 42.3-45.4) and 43.7 (95% CI, 42.145.2) at 90 days, 47.2 (95% CI, 45.5-48.9) and 46.9 (95% CI,
45.2-48.6) at 180 days, and 54.2 (95% CI, 51.7-56.6) and 53.6
(95% CI, 51.1-56.0) at 365 days. There were no harmful
adverse events attributed to the intervention.
Amongsecondaryoutcomes,thereweresignificantlyfewer
deaths at 1 year in the intervention arm (8 of 187 [4.3%]) than
in the usual care arm (19 of 197 [9.6%]) (P = .04); the number
needed to treat was 20 (95% CI, 10-307). Fewer patients died
intheinterventionarmovertime(P = .04,log-ranktest).There
was no significant difference in 1-year hospitalization rates between the intervention arm and the usual care arm (29.4% vs
29.9%, P = .87) or in time to hospitalization between groups.
Among those who screened positive for depression, there was
greater improvement in the PHQ-9 score after 1 year in the intervention arm than in the usual care arm (2.1; 95% CI, 0.433.78 points lower; P = .01). Of the recommendations made by
the collaborative care teams, 75.7% were accepted by primary care physicians (Table 2).

### Discussion

In this multisite randomized clinical trial of 392 patients with
HF and poor health status, we found that the multifaceted
PCDM intervention did not significantly improve the primary

toring. Prior studies[30-41] evaluating the effect of HF disease
management programs on health status or quality of life have
yielded mixed results, and health status was often a secondary outcome. While we cannot determine why the PCDM intervention was unsuccessful in improving patient health status compared with usual care, several reasons are possible.
First, the intervention may simply not be effective against the
background of current usual, or standard, HF care in the VA
system. Second, while the intervention was structured and
fully specified for implementation, it was not possible to guarantee strict implementation of all components. For example,
we did not audio record and review the nurse counseling sessions for fidelity to the intervention. While many of the col

the original studies were small, single-center trials.[42,43] Disease management interventions are heterogeneous and
complex, and it can be difficult to distinguish the effect of
intervention components from the effect of the skilled and
motivated staff who conduct the intervention. Telemonitoring, a key component of many HF disease management
interventions, was shown in a 2010 study[15] to be ineffective,
contradicting the findings of a prior meta-analysis. It may be
that different disease management components are needed
for different outcomes (eg, health status, hospitalization,
and mortality).
Thereductioninmortalityassociatedwiththeintervention
has been found in other studies of disease management
interventions.[43] However, because mortality was a secondary
outcome herein, we believe that it would be inappropriate to
infer that the PCDM intervention led to reduced mortality.
Rather, we view this finding as hypothesis generating, implying the need for future studies adequately powered to detect
a difference in mortality as a primary outcome.
The improvement in health status in both arms of the
trial has some implications. First, this finding shows the
importance of examining the efficacy of disease management
interventions using a randomized study design. Evaluating
this intervention using a pre-post study design would have
found an improvement in health status more than twice the
minimal clinically meaningful change, the same improvement observed in the usual care arm. Second, it underscores
challenges in studying a population with poor health status
because some of the improvement in health status in both
arms may have been due to natural variance or regression to
the mean.
There are several limitations to this study. We were unabletoblindparticipantstotheintervention.Becausethestudy
was conducted among the population of US veterans, the results may not be generalizable to other health systems and
populations. Additional data on aspects of implementation of
the intervention may have informed why the intervention did
not improve health status compared with usual care.

the 1-year study period to see changes in health status. Fourth,
while the depression intervention resulted in an improvement in depressive symptoms, the improvement may have
been too small to improve the health status. An improvement
of 2.1 points in the PHQ-9 score is below the minimally important difference of 5 points. Future studies of disease management interventions could consider additional implementation process data to capture aspects of implementation such
as the number and quality of contacts with the care coordinator, physiological monitoring, medication adherence, or selfmanagement.
This study raises questions about the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of disease management interventions
in the current health care environment. While systematic
reviews and meta-analyses have shown reduced hospitalizations and occasionally reduced mortality from disease management, there is heterogeneity in the results, and many of
