Abstract
Patients with advanced dementia often receive poor end-of-life care. We aimed to design and pilot a palliative care and
advance care plan (ACP) intervention. Patients had undergone emergency hospital admission and had severe dementia.
The intervention consisted of a palliative care patient assessment which informed an ACP discussion with the carer, who
was offered the opportunity to write an ACP for the person with dementia. Carer–patient dyads were randomized to
‘usual care’ or the intervention. Carer-related outcome measures included the Kessler Distress Scale, Decision
Satisfaction Inventory, Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Euroqol-5D, measured at baseline, six weeks, six
months and three months after bereavement. The Satisfaction with End of Life Care in Dementia Scale was completed
if the patient died. The 32 patient participants were physically frail and in the advanced stages of dementia: 62% had
pressure damage to the skin, all needed feeding assistance and 95% were in pain. Nearly 50% died during the six-month
follow-up period. Carers were difficult to recruit during acute admission; 33 patients and carers entered the study
(22 intervention arm; 11 control arm). Only seven carers made ACPs. The care planning discussion was well received,
but few carers wrote an ACP, despite intensive support from an experienced nurse specialist. Advance care planning is, in
theory, a necessary intervention for people with severe dementia; the reluctance of carers to write plans needs to be
explored further.

## Introduction

The UK government’s End of Life Care Strategy aims
to improve care for those with all life-limiting conditions, not just cancer.[1] With the ageing population,
dementia is increasing, occurring in 20% of those
aged 80 or over. One in three people over the age of
65 years will die with dementia,[2] many of them on acute
general hospital wards where they receive poor end-oflife care.[3]

A systematic review of the literature on palliative
care interventions for people with advanced dementia
found a lack of adequately powered clinical trials and
that ‘palliative care’ was defined as a withdrawal of
treatment or single interventions rather than a holistic
approach.[4] An unplanned acute hospital admission is a
critical event for a person with dementia in that 24% of
those with severe dementia will die and at six months
post admission mortality is as high as 50%.[5,6] Whilst
various interventions have been developed to enhance
advance care planning in nursing homes, for example
the ‘Let me Decide’ programme in Australia[7] and the
UK Gold Standards Framework,[8] no studies have
focussed on the acute hospital. This may be an appropriate time to intervene and plan end-of-life care. The
need for this is supported by qualitative research on
the views and wishes of carers and health and social
care professionals working with people with severe
dementia.[9]

In this pilot study we aimed to assess the feasibility
of implementing a two-component intervention to
improve end-of-life care for people with advanced
dementia. We report recruitment and randomization,
attrition, explore a range of outcome measures and
assess whether advance care planning is feasible for
these patients and their carers.

## Methods

A full description of the protocol has been published.[10]

The study was approved by the local Research Ethics
Committee.

## Pre-trial preparatory work to develop the intervention

 Phase I. The intervention was designed using
the Medical Research Council (MRC) Complex
Interventions Framework.[11] In phase one qualitative
work the principal carers of 20 patients with severe
dementia, (Functional Assessment Staging (FAST)
stage 6d and above[12]) admitted to an acute medical
ward were interviewed. Concurrently, 21 health care
professionals from a range of disciplines, experience
and care settings (acute hospital, nursing home and primary care) were also interviewed. We used framework


( )

analysis to identify, extract and analyse core themes.[13]

Five main themes emerged: illness awareness, communication, pain awareness, attitudes towards endof-life treatments/quality of life and hospitalization.
Awareness of the terminal nature of advanced dementia
was poor amongst both carers and health care
professionals.[9]

## Phase II. The qualitative data were used to design a
two-component intervention: (i) assessment of the palliative care needs of patients; and (ii) a framework for
the discussion of advance care planning with carers.
To obtain the most pragmatic version of the intervention, we used an iterative process, interviewing successive groups of patients, carers and members of the
clinical multi-disciplinary team. Protocol refinements
were referred to the ethics committee for approval.
This cycle was repeated twice. The intervention was
delivered by a senior nurse experienced in dementia
who also received palliative care training.

## Final format of the intervention Component 1: palliative care needs assessment of patient. The patient assessment took 30 minutes
using a structured clinical approach that built on
usual care. It covered a range of domains, including
dementia severity (measured on the FAST scale[12]),
the presence of delirium (Confusion Assessment
Method[14]), communication, pressure sore risk
(Waterlow scale[15]) and severity (Stirling scale[16]), food
and fluid intake, swallowing and feeding. As there are
no dementia pain scales validated for use in an acute
hospital setting,[17] we used observational pain scales
developed for use in other settings: the Abbey Pain
Scale,[18] the PACSLAC[19] and the Doloplus.[20] The
latter two scales have been identified in a recent systematic review as the most appropriate and clinically
useful tools for detecting pain in people with dementia.[17] This assessment generated a list of active problems that were discussed with the clinical team.
A management plan was formulated and documented
in the clinical notes. Findings were used to inform subsequent discussions with the carer.

## Component 2: discussions with carers. Up to four
consultations (at least five days apart) were offered to
carers. At first we attempted these discussions during
the hospital admission (see Figure 1, CONSORT diagram ‘Original Design’). However, it was difficult to
engage carers at this time and patients were often discharged rapidly. We therefore amended the protocol
(see Figure 1, CONSORT diagram ‘New Design’) to
allow the carer discussion to occur in the community
at a later date.

First consultation: we used structured discussions
with carers to assess: (i) level of knowledge about the
patient’s dementia; (ii) the severity of dementia and
prognosis for the patient; (iii) the patient’s physical
needs; (iv) the social situation and current levels of
social support; and (v) any records of previous preferences for care. We attempted to understand cultural,
spiritual, health, social and financial needs experienced
by the carer and the psychological support available to
them. We inquired whether the person with dementia
had made any previous advance directives or statements or had expressed any preferences for care. The
discussion was summarized, and documented in a standardized format. Any issues of serious concern were
discussed with the clinical team.
Subsequent consultations: we provided basic education on dementia as a neuro-degenerative disease, the
prognosis of advanced dementia, the role of palliative
care (focusing on palliative care as appropriate active
care, NOT withdrawal of treatment) and advance care
planning. Some carers wanted only basic information
whilst others wished to receive as much information as
possible. Specific issues discovered during the patient

needs assessment were documented on a sheet that
was used to guide this structured discussion. For example, if we identified that the person with dementia was
showing non-verbal pain behaviours, we explained and
interpreted these with the carer so that they could recognize these in the future.

## Advance care planning. Advance care planning is a
process of discussion between the patient and a health
care professional including important values or goals
for care, understanding about illness and prognosis
and preferences for types of care or treatment that
may be beneficial in the future.[21] People with advanced
dementia may not have the have capacity to make complex decisions, thus carers were given the opportunity
to formulate an advance care plan (ACP), including
statements of preferences and wishes for the person
with dementia using an adapted version of a tool developed by the UK National Health Service (NHS)
(Preferred Priorities for Care).[8] The carers were asked
to consider any views that the person with dementia
may have expressed, whilst they still had the capacity
to do so. Copies were placed in the medical notes, sent


-----

to the general practitioner (GP) (and if relevant the
nursing home) and kept by the carer.

## Feasibility randomized controlled trial of the intervention with patient–carer dyads

We piloted this intervention in a two-arm feasibility
cluster randomized controlled trial. We recruited from
two acute medical wards served by separate medical
teams, for patients aged 70 years or over, in an inner
London teaching hospital serving a socioeconomically
and ethnically diverse population. All new admissions
on the intervention ward and control ward were
screened for eligibility. We recruited patients with
advanced primary degenerative dementia (FAST stage
6d or worse: urinary incontinence and needing assistance with all activities of daily living) with an
unplanned admission for a treatable acute medical illness. Patients were included if they had an informal carer
(family member or friend in regular contact, who did not
act in any professional capacity, and who was next of kin
or a ‘key decision maker’) who was able to give informed
consent and assent for patients. Those consenting in the
control arm were fully informed about the trial and
received usual care. We aimed to recruit 40 patient–
carer dyads to each study arm. As this was a pilot trial
no power calculation was required and these numbers
were chosen on pragmatic grounds.

## Measures. Our main outcome was the number of
carers making an ACP. We also tested a number of
other outcome measures. Data on these was collected
by an independent researcher.

(1) Carer-related measures

Kessler Distress Scale (KD10): a 10-item scale giving
a total ‘distress score’ (range 10–50, higher scores indicating a higher level of distress) and a categorical score
indicating whether participants are ‘likely to be well’,
‘likely to have a mild mental disorder’, ‘likely to have
moderate mental disorder’ or ‘likely to have a severe
mental disorder’.
Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D): a measure of health status
and quality of life, this comprises a five-item scale
and a visual analogue scale indicating overall health
state (scored 0–100 with lower scores indicating
poorer health).[22]

Decision Conflicts Scale (DCS): measures uncertainty and difficulties in the decision making process.[23]

Scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100
(extremely high decisional conflict).
Decision Satisfaction Inventory (DSI): gives an overall score of decision satisfaction (range 10–50, higher
scores indicating less satisfaction).[24]


( )

State Anger Scale (SAS): a subscale from the StateTrait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), which
measures intensity of angry feelings at a particular
time.[25] Scores range from 10 to 40, with higher scores
indicating greater levels of anger.
Life Satisfaction Scale (LSQ): obtained from the
Lancashire Quality of Life Profile, this is a sevenpoint ‘ladder scale’ anchored at 0, representing the
‘very worst outcome that you could expect to have in
life’ and increasing to 7, with the top representing ‘the
very best outcome you could have expected’.[26]

Satisfaction with End of Life Care in Advanced
Dementia Scale (SWC-EOLCD): measures satisfaction
with end-of-life care (range 10–40) with higher scores
indicating greater satisfaction. This was only completed
after the patient had died, if the carer felt able, without
undue distress.
We also included a general assessment of how care
planning was experienced and noted whether the carer
decided to formulate an ACP.

(2) Patient related measures

Pain and distress: carers were asked to indicate on
visual analogue scales how much pain and distress
they thought the person with dementia was experiencing. Scores ranged from 1 (no pain/no distress) to 5
(severe pain/severe distress).

## Follow up

Guided by current evidence on survival time and prognosis for this patient group, follow-up assessments
occurred at six weeks and six months.[5,6] Relatives of
patients who died during the study were seen three
months after the death to complete the DSI, Caregiver
Strain Questionnaire (CSQ), EQ5-D, KD10, LSQ, SAS
and SWC-EOLCD scales. We also investigated whether
information could be collected about the care received at
death. A qualitative analysis of how the structured
assessment of patient needs may have influenced subsequent patient and carer experiences will be reported in a
further case-study paper.

## Results Protocol amendments

The acute hospital admission was often not a suitable
time for carers to take part in research as their main
concern was the patient’s care. We amended the study
protocol to allow recruitment, consent and randomization at an individual level. Carer discussions were then
offered after the person with dementia had left hospital.
Computer-generated random allocation was performed

p

by an independent statistician. This removed the need
for clustering at ward level and maximized recruitment
(see Figure 1). Carers in both control and intervention
groups were offered an information pack compiled
from publicly available internet information and leaflets. This included an information sheet from the UK
Alzheimer’s Society on advanced dementia, a leaflet on
advance care planning and one giving a simple definition of palliative care.

## Recruitment rates

Recruitment and attrition are shown in Figure 1.
We approached 384 patients with severe dementia.
Seventy one (19%) had no available next of kin,
18 (5%) were discharged before they could be assessed
for eligibility or before consent from carers could be
obtained (original design), 76 (20%) did not have
severe dementia, 43 (11%) died and 64 (17%) were
not eligible for other reasons, such as no clear diagnosis
and adult protection issues. One hundred and twelve
were eligible. Of these, 39 (35%) carers of patients


were not contactable, five patients (4%) died (original
design), 35 (31%) declined and 34 (30%) consented.
Thirty-three entered the study, 22 in the intervention
arm and 11 in the control arm. Of these 33, 31 (94%)
completed the baseline assessment, 15 (45%) the first
follow-up assessment and 11 (33%) the second followup assessment. Twenty patients were assessed, and
17 carers took part in the carer discussions. Three
patients died prior to finishing the discussions and
two carers dropped out after the first meeting. Seven
carers made an ACP.

## Characteristics of study participants

The mean age of the patients was 87 years and the
cohort was predominantly female (81%). Half had
either urinary tract infections or pneumonia, and 41%
had one or more re-admissions to hospital during the
six-month study period. Sixty-nine per cent were admitted from residential or nursing homes. Carers (mean
age 59 years), were mainly daughters and not involved
in an active caring role (Table 1). There were no major

dyads that completed the study, withdrew or died
before finishing the discussions (Table 1). Table 2
gives the study participant characteristics by randomization group.

## Findings from patient assessments in the intervention group

The 22 patients in the intervention group were mainly
bed-bound, although 10 (45%) spent some time in a
chair. On the Stirling Scale, 38% had intact skin,
23% had discolouration of intact skin, 28% had partial
thickness skin loss or damage to the epidermis or
dermis and 2% had full thickness skin loss. The mean
Waterlow score was 21.6 (SD 4.5, range 14–33), and
57% scored more than 20, indicating a high risk of


developing pressure sores. All needed feeding assistance, 14 (63%) had poor oral intake and two were
artificially fed. Thirteen patients (59%) had some
degree of dysphagia and were on ‘risk management’
feeding. All were doubly incontinent.

## Communication. All 22 patients had diminished levels
of language. Seven (32%) were able to state simple preferences for food, indicate the presence of pain or understand simple instructions such as ‘open your mouth’.
The remainder used non-verbal communication, such
as facial expressions. Six (27%) of the most severely
affected patients (FAST scale 7d or 7f) displayed distressed behaviour during care tasks.

## Pain. On the Abbey pain scale, one patient (5%)
had no pain, nine patients (45%) had mild pain and

10 (50%) had moderate pain. None was assessed to
have severe pain. Pain was chronic in five patients
(25%), acute in four (20%) and acute or chronic in
11 patients (55%). On the Doloplus-2 scale, the mean
score was 8 (SD 6.5, range 3–22), and 67% scored
above the cut-off point (5 or above) indicating the presence of pain. Mean scores on the PACSLAC scale were
8 (SD 5.4, range 3–22). This scale does not currently
have a scoring interpretation available.

## Spiritual and religious needs. The religious affiliation
of all patients was noted from carer interviews. Those
who agreed to a care planning discussion said they
wished their relative’s religious needs to be respected
at the time of death. Two patients were atheists and
their carers emphasized that they should not be visited
by a hospital chaplain. No unmet spiritual needs were
identified.

## Findings from carer discussions. It was difficult to
conduct discussions in the hospital as no private
room was available. Research interviews were not
seen as part of clinical care and some carers preferred
to remain at the patient’s bed side. Using the amended
protocol, discussions were held in the community where
it was easier to discuss sensitive issues.
Some carers were very knowledgeable about the
patient’s status and prognosis, while others needed
more time to explore the patient’s situation. The
seven carers who chose to make a written ACP were
closely involved in the patient’s care, saw them on most
days of the week, viewed themselves as being key in coordinating and managing their relative’s care and had
witnessed their progressive deterioration. Two of the
patients with an ACP died during the study period,
both remaining in their home at the time of death as
requested by the carer.


Of the seven carers who completed an ACP, two had
clear wishes about the place of death and level of intervention preferred. The remaining five chose more open
statements, such as, ‘the family is aware of the complications related to swallowing difficulties but wish to
make decisions about artificial feeding if and when
needed’. None of the patients had expressed clear preferences to their carers about end-of-life care when they
still had capacity.

## Study outcomes

Attrition precluded statistical comparison of control
and intervention groups, but some trends are suggested
by the data (Table 3). Mean KD10 distress scores were
higher in the cohort at baseline (mean 21.3) and
decreased by the time of the final assessment (mean
14.7), increasing again around bereavement (mean
19.7). The proportion of carers who were rated in the
‘well’ category of the KD10 and the LSQ also showed a
similar trend, with improvement in the months following the patient’s index admission. Decisional conflict
was higher at the time of hospital admission and
increased in the carers receiving the intervention at
each time point. Carer perceived health, as measured
on the EQ-5D, improved after the initial admission.
There were no observable trends in the carer ratings
of patients’ pain or distress.
We needed to access GP records of deceased patient
to assess the end-of-life care received. We obtained ethical committee permission for this, but some GPs did
not allow access. One GP sought legal advice and stated
that unless we were able to show that the carer was a
legal representative of the patient, that is, that they
were executor of the patient’s will, they were unable
to let us view records. Obtaining such documentation
was outside of the remit of this research.

## Discussion

 Development of the intervention

We were able to develop a clinically pragmatic intervention building on phase I work and informed by
guidance from the MRC framework for developing
complex interventions.[11,27] Our intervention comprised
a specialist assessment of the patient’s palliative care
needs that informed an advance care planning discussion with the carer. The discussion aimed to aid future
decision making and therefore improve the quality of
and satisfaction with end-of-life care. Participation of
the clinical multi-disciplinary team in reaching the final
format of the intervention facilitated its integration
with the clinical service.

## Recruitment and attrition

We had hoped to recruit 40 patient–carer dyads to each
study arm. However, we achieved 32 patient–carer
dyads of whom 22 received our intervention. We
found the acute medical ward a challenging environment in which to conduct this study. A third of patients
admitted with advanced dementia did not have an
informal carer/next of kin who could discuss and consider ACPs, rapid treatment and discharge of patients
meant that 10% left the hospital before contact with
carers could be made and carers were focussed on the
immediate care of patients. As this was a pilot study, we
modified our methodology to try and improve recruitment. We continued to conduct patient assessments
during the admission but found the discussion with
carers was best carried out after the person with dementia had been discharged from hospital. Despite this
amendment, recruitment rates remained low, suggesting that the time of acute hospital admission was not
optimal for engaging carers in advance care planning.
Follow-up rates were low due to patient mortality and
carer withdrawal.

## Study population – patients

Our study population was in the advanced stages of
dementia and physically frail: two thirds showed signs
of pressure damage to the skin, all needed feeding assistance and 95% were experiencing mild or moderate
pain. Of the 32 participants, nearly half died during the
six-month follow-up period. This concords with other
work[5] suggesting that our recruitment strategy correctly
identified patients who were nearing the end of life.

## Patient needs assessment

This was mainly observational and much of the
required information could be obtained during routine


( )

care tasks. Establishing whether the patient fulfilled
study criteria was problematic; information about function prior to admission was not always available and
those with milder dementia may appear more advanced
when physically ill. Nursing homes and GP surgeries
were not willing to provide this information for a
research project. The structured assessment was well
received by clinical staff, particularly the information
it provided regarding communication ability and pain.
The assessment did not appear to cause distress to the
patient and in a number of patients we found previously undetected pain; this was the principle information that was fed back to clinical teams.

## Study outcome measures

We explored a range of outcome measures. The KD10
appeared sensitive in detecting carer distress around the
time of hospital admission and after bereavement. The
LSQ showed a similar pattern of response. The SAS did
not show any trends during the study but, as would be
expected, levels of anger did increase in carers during
bereavement. Because of this we would anticipate just
using the KD10 in future work. Decisional conflict
appeared to increase in the intervention group as the
study progressed. This may be due to chance or because
carers who received the intervention were presented
with more options and possibilities to consider, increasing the decisional conflict that they experienced. Carers
reported that the SWC-EOLCD was easy to complete
and the range of scores in our cohort reflected that
found in the North American population used to validate the scale.[28] This scale shows high convergent validity with the DSI[28] and in further studies we would
consider just using the SWC-EOLCD to reduce the
burden of study measures.

## Advance care plans

Advance care planning is a cornerstone of the government’s end-of-life care strategy,[1] but we found it
difficult to engage carers in formulating these. Only
seven ACPs were made during this study, despite that
fact that 22 patient–carer dyads received the intervention. Reasons for choosing not to make an ACP were
complex and included conflicting family dynamics and
a general unwillingness to address end-of-life care
issues. Most difficulty occurred in accepting what was
going to happen in the future, with an unwillingness to
make decisions about hypothetical future scenarios.
The number choosing to make a written ACP does
not necessarily measure the full effect of the intervention and may not be the most appropriate outcome.
All carers were keen to receive more information
about end-of-life issues in dementia and to have an


-----

p

opportunity to express their concerns. They found
the discussions very helpful, even if they did not go
on to make an ACP. Perhaps these should be seen
as part of a process of preparing carers for terminal
stage of dementia. We found that the simple pack
of information about dementia was well received
by carers.

## Methodological challenges

This pilot study highlights a number of methodological
challenges. The acute hospital was not an easy environment in which to recruit study participants. Patients
with advanced dementia do not have capacity to consent and many do not have carers to give assent for
them. A randomized controlled trial of advance care
planning for people over the age of 80 years, after
acute hospital admission, has shown positive results
but all of these study participants had capacity to participate.[29] Alternatively, independent advocates
employed within the remit of the Mental Capacity
Act may need to ensure that these patients receive
better end-of-life care. Despite the fact that the study
had ethics approval and carers gave consent for their
participation and assent for the patient, we had great
difficulty in accessing GP records to enable us to document care received at the end of life. We were unable
to establish the reasons why so many carers withdrew;
however, carers of people with dementia are often
stressed and burdened.[30] Most of the carers in our
study were daughters who lived away from the person
with dementia and had full-time employment. The
drop-out rates may be explained by the fact that this
was not perceived to be an active ‘treatment trial’ that
could directly improve patient care.

## Clinical implications

Our intervention was delivered by a highly experienced
nurse with a background in acute medical and dementia
care. Over 100 patients were assessed for eligibility but
only seven ACPs were made. Although most carers said
they found the discussions helpful, many were reluctant
to formulate an ACP. It has been suggested that discussion and provision of information are the most
useful part of advance care planning with proxies,[31]

but it is difficult to measure the ‘benefit’ of these.[32]

Ideally, the person with dementia should consider
making an ACP whilst in the earlier stages of the disease, when they have the ability to discuss such issues
and can be more actively involved in making choices
for their future care. There is evidence that older people
who view a video depiction of a patient with advanced
dementia are more likely to opt for comfort as their
goal of care compared with those who just listen to a


verbal description;[33] such tools could be adapted for
people in the early stages of dementia.
We feel it is important to publish this ‘negative’
finding. Research governance and difficulties in accessing GP and community notes may mean that alternative methodologies to the randomized controlled trial
need to be explored. Caplan et al.[7] demonstrated
reduced hospital admissions after an advance care
planning intervention for nursing home residents,
but this occurred in the context of a whole system.
The UK Gold Standards Framework[8] includes
advance care planning for frail older people with
dementia and audit data from this suggests an impact
on end-of-life care. Demonstration of benefit may
require a ‘systemic’ approach rather than our individual
approach.[34]

## Conclusion

Given the pressures of the acute medical environment,
this intervention could not simply be added to routine
clinical care. It may be that a specific staff role is
developed to perform this work, which will have
cost implications for acute trusts. This needs to be
balanced against potential savings achieved by avoiding inappropriate acute hospital admissions at the end
of life.[35] Advance care planning is a key aspect of the
government’s End of Life Care Strategy but this may
not be feasible where proxies are involved for those
lacking capacity. More evidence is needed on the benefits of ACPs developed by people with dementia
before they lose capacity. Increasing evidence in
other long-term conditions suggests that substantial
proportions of people do not wish to make such
plans.[36] This may be due to underlying attitudes
related to denial of death, a belief in taking ‘one day
at a time’ or the ‘impossibility’ of planning for the
future.[36] Our pilot study has highlighted challenges
in this type of work.
