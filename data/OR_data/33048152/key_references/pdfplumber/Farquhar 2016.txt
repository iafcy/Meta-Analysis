Abstract
Background: Breathlessness is themost common and intrusive symptom of advanced non-malignant respiratory
and cardiac conditions. The Breathlessness InterventionService (BIS) is a multi-disciplinary complex intervention,
theoretically underpinned by a palliative care approach, utilising evidence-based non-pharmacological and
pharmacologicalinterventions to support patients withadvanced disease inmanaging theirbreathlessness. Having
published theeffectiveness and cost effectiveness of BIS for patients withadvancedcancer and their carers, we
sought to establish its effectiveness, and costeffectiveness, inadvanced non-malignant conditions.
Methods: This was a single-centre Phase III fast-tracksingle-blindmixed method RCT of BISversusstandard care for
breathless patients with non-malignant conditions and theircarers.Randomisation was to one of two groups
(randomly permuted blocks). Eighty-seven patients referred to BIS were randomised (interventionarm n=44;
control arm n=43 receivedBIS after four-week wait); 79 (91 %)completedto key outcome measurement. The
primary outcome measure was 0–10 numeric rating scale for patient distressdue to breathlessness atfour weeks.
Secondary outcomemeasures were Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, HospitalAnxietyand Depression Scale,
Client Service Receipt Inventory,EQ-5Dand topic-guided interviews.
Results: Qualitative analysesshowed thepositive impactofBISon patients withnon-malignant conditions and
their carers; quantitative analyses showed a non-significant greater reduction in theprimary outcome (‘distress due
to breathlessness’), when compared to standard care, of–0.24 (95 % CI:–1.30, 0.82). BIS resulted inextra mean costs
of£799, reducing to £100 when outliers were excluded; neither difference was statistically significant. The
quantitative findings contrasted withthosepreviously reported for patients with cancer and their carers, which
showed BIS to be both clinically and cost effective. For patientswith non-malignant conditions therewas a notable
trendof improvementover both trial arms to the key measurement point; participants may have experienced a
therapeutic effectfrom theresearch interviews, diluting theintervention’simpact.

Conclusions: BIS had a statistically non-significant effect for patients with non-malignant conditions, and slightly
increased service costs, but had a qualitatively positive impact consistent with findingsfor advancedcancer. Trials
ofpalliativecare interventions should consider multiple, mixedmethod, primary outcomesand ensure that
