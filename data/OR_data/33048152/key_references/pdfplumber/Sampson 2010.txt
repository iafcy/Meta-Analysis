Abstract
Patients with advanced dementia often receivepoorend-of-life care.Weaimed to design andpilot a palliativecareand
advance careplan (ACP) intervention. Patients had undergone emergency hospital admission and had severedementia.
TheinterventionconsistedofapalliativecarepatientassessmentwhichinformedanACPdiscussionwiththecarer,who
was offered the opportunity to write an ACP for the person with dementia. Carer–patient dyads were randomized to
‘usual care’ or the intervention. Carer-related outcome measures included the Kessler Distress Scale, Decision
Satisfaction Inventory, Client Satisfaction Questionnaire and the Euroqol-5D, measured at baseline, six weeks, six
months and three months after bereavement. The Satisfaction with End of Life Care in Dementia Scale was completed
if the patient died. The 32 patient participants were physically frail and in the advanced stages of dementia: 62% had
pressuredamagetotheskin,allneededfeedingassistanceand95%wereinpain.Nearly50%diedduringthesix-month
follow-up period. Carers were difficult to recruit during acute admission; 33 patients and carers entered the study
(22 intervention arm; 11 control arm). Only seven carers made ACPs. The care planning discussion was well received,
butfewcarerswroteanACP,despiteintensivesupportfromanexperiencednursespecialist.Advancecareplanningis,in
theory, a necessary intervention for people with severe dementia; the reluctance of carers to write plans needs to be
explored further.
