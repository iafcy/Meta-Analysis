with Acute Heart Failure:
Outcomes from a Randomized Trial

Abstract
Background: Heart failure (HF) is associated with a high symptom burden and reduced quality of life (QOL).
Modelsintegratingpalliativecare(PC)intoHFcarehavebeenproposed,butlimitedresearchisavailableonthe
outcomes of such models.
Objective: Our aim was to assess if inpatient PC for HF patients is associated with improvements in symptom
burden, depressive symptoms, QOL, or differential use of services.
Methods: Patients hospitalized with acute HF were randomized to receive a PC consult with follow-up as
determinedbyproviderorstandardcare.Twohundredthirty-twopatients(116intervention/116control)froma
large tertiary-care urban hospital were recruited over a 10-month period. Primary outcomes were symptom
burden, depressive symptoms, and QOL measured at baseline, 1, and 3 months. Secondary outcomes included
advance care planning (ACP), inpatient 30-day readmission, hospice use, and death.
Results: Improvements were greater at both 1 and 3 months in the intervention group for primary outcome
summary measures after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status differences between study groups. QOL
scores increased by 12.92 points in the intervention and 8 points in the control group at 1 month (differ-
ence+4.92, p<0.001). Improvement in symptom burden was 8.39 in the intervention group and 4.7 in the
control group at 1 month (+3.69, p<0.001). ACP was the only secondary outcome associated with the
intervention (hazard ratio [HR] 2.87, p=0.033).
Conclusion: An inpatient PC model for patients with acute HF is associated with short-term improvement in
symptom burden, QOL, and depressive symptoms.
