ABSTRACT
Background: Palliative care improves care and reduces costs for hospitalized patients with life-lim-
iting illnesses. There have been no multicenter randomized trials examining impact on patient sat-
isfaction, clinical outcomes, and subsequent health care costs.
Objective: Measure the impact of an interdisciplinary palliative care service (IPCS) on patient sat-
isfaction, clinical outcomes, and cost of care for 6 months posthospital discharge.
Methods: Multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. IPCS provided consultative, interdisciplinary,
palliative care to intervention patients. Controls received usual hospital care (UC).
Setting and sample: Five hundred seventeen patients with life-limiting illnesses from a hospital in
Denver, Portland, and San Francisco enrolled June 2002 to December 2003.
Measures: Modified City of Hope Patient Questionnaire, total health care costs, hospice utiliza-
tion, and survival.
Results: IPCS reported higher scores for the Care Experience scale (IPCS: 6.9 versus UC: 6.6,
p(cid:2)0.04) and for the Doctors, Nurses/Other Care Providers Communication scale (IPCS: 8.3 ver-
sus UC: 7.5, p(cid:2)0.0004). IPCS patients had fewer intensive care admissions (ICU) on hospital read-
mission (12 versus 21, p(cid:2)0.04), and lower 6-month net cost savings of $4,855 per patient (p(cid:2)
0.001). IPCS had longer median hospice stays (24 days versus 12 days, p(cid:2)0.04). There were no dif-
ferences in survival or symptom control.
Conclusions: IPCS patients reported greater satisfaction with their care experience and providers’
communication, had fewer ICU admissions on readmission, and lower total health care costs fol-
lowing hospital discharge.
