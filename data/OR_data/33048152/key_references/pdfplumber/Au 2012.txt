Objective: Patients with COPD consistently express a desire to discuss end-of-life care with clini-
cians, but these discussions rarely occur. We assessed whether an intervention using patient-
specifi c feedback about preferences for discussing end-of-life care would improve the occurrence
and quality of communication between patients with COPD and their clinicians.
Methods: W e performed a cluster-randomized trial of clinicians and patients from the outpatient
clinics at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Using self-reported questionnaires,
we assessed patients’ preferences for communication, life-sustaining therapy, and experiences at
the end of life. The intervention clinicians and patients received a one-page patient-specifi c feed-
back form, based on questionnaire responses, to stimulate conversations. The control group com-
pleted questionnaires but did not receive feedback. Patient-reported occurrence and quality of
end-of-life communication (QOC) were assessed within 2 weeks of a targeted visit. Intention-to-
treat regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations to account for
clustering of patients within clinicians.
Results: Ninety-two clinicians contributed 376 patients. Patients in the intervention arm reported
nearly a threefold higher rate of discussions about end-of-life care (unadjusted, 30% vs 11%;
P , .001). Baseline end-of-life communication was poor (intervention group QOC score, 23.3;
95% CI, 19.9-26.8; control QOC score, 19.2; 95% CI, 15.9-22.4). Patients in the intervention arm
reported higher-quality end-of-life communication that was statistically signifi cant, although the
overall improvement was small (Cohen effect size, 0.21).
Conclusions: A one-page patient-specifi c feedback form about preferences for end-of-life care
and communication improved the occurrence and quality of communication from patients’
perspectives.

The intervention also improved the quality of com-

improvement was modest as assessed by the Cohen
effect size. The intervention was designed to incorpo-
rate patient-centered preferences for communication
about end-of-life care and promote this communica-
tion between patients, surrogates, and clinicians. To
enhance translation into practice, the intervention
was designed to fi t within the context of an outpatient
clinic and was designed not to require additional

results suggest that providing patient-specifi c prefer-
ences in a one-page feedback form is an effective
intervention to improve the occurrence of advanced
care planning discussions in the outpatient setting.
