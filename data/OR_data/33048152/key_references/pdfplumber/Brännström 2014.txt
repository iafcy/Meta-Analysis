Methods From January 2011 to October 2012, 36 (26 males, 10 females, mean age 81.9years) patients with chronic heart
andresults failure (NYHA class III–IV) were randomized to PREFER and 36 (25 males, 11 females, mean age 76.6years)
to the control group at a single centre. Prospective assessments were made at 1, 3, and 6 months using the
EdmontonSymptomAssessmentScale,EuroQol,KansasCityCardiomyopathyQuestionnaire,andrehospitalizations.
Between-group analysis revealed that patients receiving PREFER had improved HRQL compared with controls
(57.6±19.2vs.48.5±24.4,age-adjustedP-value=0.05).Within-groupanalysisrevealeda26%improvementinthe

Swedish Register of Palliative Care between patients with heart
disease and those with cancer.4 For example, patients with heart
disease experience more shortness of breath and have fewer
drugs prescribed on demand against the usual symptoms, com-
pared with patients with cancer.4 In addition, patients with CHF
oftenrequirefrequenthospitalizationsandreadmissions,suggest-
ing insufficient management of these patients, which may be due
to the frequency of concomitant chronic diseases. The European
Society of Cardiology (ESC) has pointed out that selected

patients require palliative care services in addition to the heart
failuremanagementprogramme.3Guidelines5haveconcludedthat
a great need exists for new models of integrated care, such as
active heart failure and palliative care, in order to facilitate care
equality for dying patients regardless of diagnosis. This idea is
also in line with the World Health Organization’s description
of palliative care.6 We found some information in the literature
concerning the advantages and effects of an in-hospital specialist
heart failure- and home-based palliative care for patients with
severeCHF.7ACochranereviewshowedthathomepalliativecare
reduces symptom burden, particularly for patients with cancer,
but more research is needed on valid outcomes in populations
with non-malignant conditions and powered studies are required
tocomparedifferentmodelsofhomepalliativecare.8
Here, we report the clinical outcome of a new model that
integrates Palliative advanced home caRE and heart FailurE caRe
(PREFER) for patients with severe CHF (Figure 1) as described
previously.9 Our hypothesis was that the combination of key
components for delivering heart failure care and palliative care
contained in PREFER should reduce the total symptom burden,
increasehealth-relatedqualityoflife(HRQL)andfunctionalcapac-
ity,andreducemorbidity.

Assessments and outcomes
Prospective assessments were made at baseline and 1, 3, and 6
months of follow-up using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment

The QoL was also measured using the disease-specific instru-
ment, the KCCQ, which measures physical limitation, symptoms
(frequency, severity, and recent change over time), QoL, social
interference, and self-efficacy. The KCCQ is a valid and reliable
instrumentinaSwedishCHFpopulation.16Scoresaretransformed
toarangeof0–100,inwhichhigherscoresreflectbetterhealth
status.
Statistical analysis
Patients with CHF (NYHA class III–IV) were considered to have
a mean total symptom burden corresponding to 50 points out
of 100 according to the ESAS scale and compared with findings
by Follwell etal.17 for patients with cancer. The patients in that
studyhad ameanESASDistressScore(EDS)of39.5atbaseline,
and a mean improvement in the EDS of 8.8 points. The PREFER
model was created to improve the mean symptom burden by at
least25%comparedwiththecontrolgroup.Withapowerof80%,
significance level of P<0.05, and an estimated drop-out rate of
15%,31patientswereneededineacharm(total62patients).Due
to patients dropping out, mainly due to deaths (12 patients), the
numberofparticipantswasincreasedto36ineacharm.
Results are presented as the mean±standard deviation (SD)
or frequencies expressed as percentages. Comparisons between
the intervention and control groups were made using the 𝜒2
test for proportions and Student’s t-test for normally distributed
continuousvariables.TheShapiro–Wilkstatisticwasusedtotest
normality. If the distributions were not normal or ordinal, the
Mann–WhitneyU-testor𝜒2withFisher’sexacttestforcategorical
variables was used. For within-group analysis of non-normally
distributeddata,theWilcoxonmatched-pairsigned-ranktestwas
used. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate the odds
ratio and 95% confidence interval for different variables after
adjusting for age differences between the groups. All analyses
were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. A P-value <0.05
was considered significant. The data were analysed using PASW
Statistics18.
Ethics
Oral and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants. The investigation conforms to the principles out-
lined in the Declaration of Helsinki, 1964. The Regional Ethics
Committee for Human Research at Umeå University (reference
number2010-294-31M)approvedthestudy,whichwasregistered
atwww.clinicaltrials.gov(registrationnumberNCT01304381).

two groups were balanced with respect to baseline character-
istics except for mean age (PREFER 81.9±7.2years vs. control
76.6±10.2years,P=0.012;Table1).
All patients were regarded as optimally treated by their physi-
cians, and pharmacological treatment was characterized by a
relatively high number of evidence-based therapies with regard
to inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system, beta-blockers, and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (Table 1). There were a
number of serious co-morbidities but there was no statistically
significant difference between the two groups (Table 1). Twelve
patientsdiedduringthestudy;theremaining60patientscompleted
thestudy.
Euro Qol-5D: health-related quality of life
No difference was found between the two treatment groups
at baseline for HRQL assessed with the EQ-5D. At 6 months,
the PREFER group had an increased HRQL, from 47.7±19.4 to
60.4±20.6,comparedwith48.2±23.1vs.52.3±23.2forcontrols
(age-adjusted P-value=0.10). The between-group analysis of the
age-adjusteddelta-valueofHRQLfrombaselineto6monthswas
significantly(P=0.02)betterforpatientsinthePREFERgroupthan
forcontrols.
If the last measurement at 1, 3, or 6 months was analysed,
the delta-difference of HRQL, after adjusting for age, was still
significantlybetter(P=0.04)inthePREFERgroup.
ForthefivedimensionsoftheEQ-5D(mobility,self-care,usual
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), no significant
differenceswerefoundbetweenthegroups(datanotshown).
In a paired within-group analysis of the PREFER group, HRQL
increased 28% from baseline to 6 months (from 46.9±21.3 to
60.4±20.6,P=0.013).IfallmeasurementsofHRQL(1,3,and6
months)wereincluded,theincreasewas20%(from48.2±19.8to
57.6±19.2,P=0.026).Correspondingvaluesforthecontrolgroup

48.7±24.0 to 49.6±23.8, P=0.74), respectively. For the other
dimensions,nosignificantdifferenceswerefound.
The Edmonton Symptom Assessment
Scale
No significant differences were found between the PREFER and
control groups in regard to any item of the ESAS scale or after
adjusting for age difference (data not shown). Nausea was signif-
icantly improved (2.3±2.7 vs. 1.2±1.7, P=0.02) in the PREFER

to evaluate a new approach for CHF management by integrating
specializedpalliativehomecareandheartfailurecare.Thisstudy
provides new information about the PREFER model resulting in
improved HRQL, total symptom burden, and NYHA functional
class in association with reductions in the number of hospitaliza-
tions and days spent in hospital at both the Medicine-Geriatrics
and Surgery departments. These findings are in line with the
results of the PCC-HF study,20 which showed that PCC during
in-hospital care impacts the length of stay in the hospital and
maintainedfunctionalperformance.

is largely managed in primary care in mild to moderate stages,
the problems arise in more advanced situations, especially when
the syndrome of CHF is accompanied by co-morbidities. This is
not easily handled by primary healthcare physicians.25 A bridge
between acute care of CHF at hospitals and primary healthcare
hasbeensuccessfullyfulfilledbyheartfailureclinics,26whichfocus
primarily on the management of heart failure. The strategy of
PREFERgoesbeyondtraditionalheartfailuremanagementinclinics
by including specialized palliative care as practised for cancer
patients. One of the main differences from standard heart failure
managementisthatPREFERalsotakesmorecomprehensivecare
of accompanying co-morbidities. The team is responsible for the

of decubitus, falling, and malnutrition is continual. This does not

with out-of-hours palliative advanced home care. This team is
fullyinformedoftheidentitiesofthepatientsandknowshowto

On the other hand, PREFER differs from traditional palliative
care by including active heart failure treatment with acute heart
resuscitation if needed, according to the patient’s expressed
desire.19,27Evenmoreimportantistheintentiontouseallmodern
pharmacological treatments and other types of devices, such as
CRT, if necessary, to reduce symptom burden. The decision to
include this form of active treatment arises from the difficulty
in defining a transition point to palliative care for heart failure
patients.19,27,28 Theirlivesaresometimesdescribedas‘livingnear
death’or‘arollercoasterlife’,i.e.anongoingoscillationbetween
ups and downs.18 The unpredictable progression of the illness
leads to a great risk that these patients and their close relatives

We consider that the PCC has had a substantial impact on the
results. One of the main differences between the two strategies
wasthenursevisitsatthepatient’shome,whichweresubstantially

Further research is needed to evaluate the separate impact
of each component of the PREFER concept, if possible, and its
contributiontothebeneficialeffectsfoundinthepresentstudy.
Limitations
Our findings have a number of limitations. First, patients in the
PREFER group were significantly older than those in the control
group,butthisdifferencewasadjustedforinthefollow-upanalyses.
Secondly,theoutcomeanalyseswerenotblinded;functionalclass
was evaluated by physicians involved in the trial. Questionnaires
were filled out by participating patients who knew the group to
which they belonged. This may have introduced some bias into
thesymptomreportingandassessmentofNYHAclasses.Thirdly,
this study was small and at a single centre, which should be
considered when interpreting and generalizing the study findings.
Although the number of patients was limited, a strength of this
studywasthatweincludedpatientswithahighnumberofsevere
co-morbidities that are seldom accepted in most randomized
clinical trials. The exclusion criteria were mostly for practical or
administrativereasons,soweconsiderthepatientsinthisstudyto
