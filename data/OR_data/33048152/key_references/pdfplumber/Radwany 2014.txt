Abstract
ThespecificaimofthePEACEpilotstudywastodeterminethefeasibilityofafullypoweredstudytotestthe
effectiveness of an in-home geriatrics/palliative care interdisciplinary care management intervention for im-
proving measures of utilization, quality of care, and quality of life in enrollees of Ohio’s community-based long-
term care Medicaid waiver program, PASSPORT. This was a randomized pilot study (n=40 intervention [IG],
n=40 usual care) involving new enrollees into PASSPORT who were >60 years old. This was an in-home
interdisciplinarychronicillnesscaremanagementinterventionbyPASSPORTcaremanagerscollaboratingwitha

not powered to test hypotheses; instead, it was hypothesis generating. Primary outcomes measured symptom
control, mood, decision making, spirituality, and quality of life. Little difference was seen in primary outcomes;
however, utilization favored the IG. At 12 months, the IG had fewer hospital visits (50% vs. 55%, P=0.65) and
fewer nursing facility admissions (22.5% vs. 32.5%, P=0.32). Using hospital-based specialists interfacing with a
