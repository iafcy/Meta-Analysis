ABSTRACT
Background: Few patients with end-stage dementia are enrolled in hospice care. A palliative
care approach would nonetheless seem to be appropriate in various care settings, including
the acute care hospital.
Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of palliative care in patients with ad-
vanced dementia (Functional Assessment Staging Tool [FAST] stage 6d-7f) who were hospi-
talized with acute illness. Intervention patients received recommendations by a palliative care
team with the goal of enhancing patient comfort; control patients received usual care with-
out these recommendations.
Results: Among 99 patients enrolled over 3 years, groups were comparable at baseline in
terms of gender, age, race, dementia stage, and advance directive status. Outcomes were sim-
ilar in terms of mean number of hospitalizations, average length of stay, and mortality. In-
tervention patients were more likely than control patients to receive a palliative care plan
(23% versus 4%; p = 0.008), usually on discharge, and more decisions were made to forgo cer-
tain medical treatments but the numbers were small. Fewer patients in the intervention group
received intravenous therapy throughout the admission (66% vs. 81%, p = 0.025). Overall, ad-
ditional interventions included daily phlebotomy for at least half of the admission (41%), sys-
temic antibiotics (75%), and new feeding tubes (44%). Including tubes present at the time of
randomization, a total of 69% received long-term enteral feeding.
Conclusion: It was difficult for a palliative care research team to influence the care of ad-
vanced dementia patients in the acute hospital setting. When patients have advanced de-
mentia, there may be unique barriers, including perceived prognostic uncertainty, difficulty
assessing comfort level, and perceptions about tube feeding. There must be a reexamination
of treatment approaches for this severely impaired group of patients. Further study should
attempt to identify patients prior to the need for acute hospitalization so goals can be estab-
lished when there is less urgency to make life and death decisions.

or any life-sustaining treatment. In addition, the
groups were analyzed as to whether there was an
overall palliative care plan on discharge or at any
time during the hospitalization.
Recommendations regarding palliative care in-
terventions were made to the inpatient team at
the hospital but contact between or after hospi-
talizations were generally with the family, be-
cause there was considerable variation among pa-
tients as to the nature, location, or existence of a
consistent physician. On readmission, the patient
was identified through a computerized system,
usually less than 24 and no more than 48 hours
after admission. Consent to continue in the study
was obtained from the surrogate by phone, and
the inpatient providers were contacted.
Outcomes were determined from the time of
initial randomization until final discharge or in-
hospital death. The entire period of observation
and data gathering from time of the first ran-
domization was 3 years. Specific data analyzed
was gleaned only from the in-hospital experience,
with the exception of the date of death for pa-
tients who survived the hospitalization, which
was ascertained by telephone follow up.
X2 and Student's t test were used to compare
intervention and control groups.
RESULTS
During 3 years, 100 patients were identified
who met inclusion criteria and for whom in-
formed consent could be obtained. One patient
was discharged in the first 24 hours after ran-
domization and was not readmitted, and was
excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 99
patients, 48 were randomly assigned to the inter-
vention group and 51 to the control group.
Baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. The groups were comparable in terms of
age, gender, dementia stage, race or ethnic group,
existence of advance directives, whether the pa-
tient had been admitted from home or a nursing
home, DRG diagnosis for the first admission, and

tia per se may be associated with a lower risk of
hospitalization for some nursing home patients,
severe functional impairment, and particularly
the presence of a feeding tube are important pre-
dictors of hospitalization.23
CONCLUSIONS
It was difficult for a palliative care research
team to influence care of advanced dementia pa-
tients in the acute hospital setting. There may be
unique barriers when patients have advanced de-
mentia, despite the profound impairments that
exist, including perceived prognostic uncertainty,
difficulty assessing pain and discomfort, and per-
ceptions about tube feeding. There must be a re-
examination of treatment approaches for this se-
verely impaired group of patients and a need to
approach advanced dementia as one would ap-
proach other end-stage illnesses. Further study
should attempt to identify patients prior to the
need for acute hospitalization so goals can be es-
tablished when there is less urgency to make life
and death decisions.
