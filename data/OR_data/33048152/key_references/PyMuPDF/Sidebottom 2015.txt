Abstract
Background: Heart failure (HF) is associated with a high symptom burden and reduced quality of life (QOL).
Models integrating palliative care (PC) into HF care have been proposed, but limited research is available on the
outcomes of such models.
Objective: Our aim was to assess if inpatient PC for HF patients is associated with improvements in symptom
burden, depressive symptoms, QOL, or differential use of services.
Methods: Patients hospitalized with acute HF were randomized to receive a PC consult with follow-up as
determined by provider or standard care. Two hundred thirty-two patients (116 intervention/116 control) from a
large tertiary-care urban hospital were recruited over a 10-month period. Primary outcomes were symptom
burden, depressive symptoms, and QOL measured at baseline, 1, and 3 months. Secondary outcomes included
advance care planning (ACP), inpatient 30-day readmission, hospice use, and death.
Results: Improvements were greater at both 1 and 3 months in the intervention group for primary outcome
summary measures after adjusting for age, gender, and marital status differences between study groups. QOL
scores increased by 12.92 points in the intervention and 8 points in the control group at 1 month (differ-
ence + 4.92, p < 0.001). Improvement in symptom burden was 8.39 in the intervention group and 4.7 in the
control group at 1 month ( + 3.69, p < 0.001). ACP was the only secondary outcome associated with the
intervention (hazard ratio [HR] 2.87, p = 0.033).
Conclusion: An inpatient PC model for patients with acute HF is associated with short-term improvement in
symptom burden, QOL, and depressive symptoms.
Introduction
E
art failure (HF) is the most common cause of hospi-
talization among adults over age 65 and is associated with
physical symptom burden including pain, shortness of breath,
fatigue, emotional and functional impairment, reduced quality
of life (QOL), and increased caregiver burden.1–6 Prior research
has documented both high levels of depression among HF
patients as well as low levels of treatment for depression.7–9 HF
also has high mortality, with a lower 5-year survival rate than
many cancers.10 Some estimates indicate 50% of people with
HF will die within 5 years of diagnosis,11 and one study esti-
mated a 36% death rate within 1 year after a HF-related hos-
pitalization.12 HF prevalence has been increasing11 and is
projected to increase 25% from 2010 to 2030.13
The ﬁeld of palliative care (PC) may be well suited to
address the needs of HF patients. PC assesses and treats
psychological distress and pain and other physical symp-
toms, and it supports functional status, communicates about
care goals, and provides support for complex decision
making.14,15 PC has been demonstrated to improve symp-
tom burden, depression, and QOL among patients with
cancer.16,17 PC can also facilitate discussions about treat-
ment preferences for end-of-life care that often remain
unaddressed.18 Models and guidelines for integrating PC
into HF management have been proposed,7,18–21 including
recommendations in the most recent American College
of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA)
guidelines22 but studies of their impact on outcomes are
needed.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether in-
corporating PC into inpatient care for HF patients is associ-
ated with improvements in health status or use of health
services. Speciﬁcally, our research questions were: is the
provision of PC to HF patients in the inpatient setting asso-
ciated with 1) differences in QOL, symptom management, or
depression? Or is it associated with 2) differences in advance
care planning (ACP), 30-day readmission, hospice use, or
mortality compared with standard care?
Methods
Setting
This study took place at Abbott Northwestern Hospital
(ANW), a 629-bed tertiary-care facility located in Minnea-
polis, Minnesota, that is part of the Allina Health system of
hospitals and clinics. In 2011, ANW had 38,000 inpatient
admissions, 366,000 outpatient registrations, and treated 732
patients with a primary diagnosis of HF. The ANW inpatient
PC team at the time of the study included four physicians
board certiﬁed in hospice and palliative medicine, two clin-
ical nurse specialists board certiﬁed in advanced practice
palliative care nursing, a social worker, and a chaplain. PC
providers conducted 1417 initial consults and 5218 subse-
quent visits to inpatients in 2011. At the time this study was
designed, hospital records indicated that PC consults were
ordered for only 9.2% of HF inpatients.
Recruitment, randomization, and study sample
Patients were considered eligible for the study if they were
adult inpatients with a diagnosis of acute HF. Patients were
not eligible if they were in the intensive care unit (ICU), on a
ventilator, undergoing evaluation for a heart transplant or a
left ventricular assist device (LVAD), post-transplant or post-
LVAD, determined to be actively dying, or if they had cog-
nitive impairments such that informed consent and data
collection would not be possible or if they spoke limited
English. Additionally, patients who had already had a PC
order request by their attending physician during the hospital
stay were ineligible.
Potentially eligible patients were identiﬁed using reports
from the electronic health record (EHR). Eligibility was
veriﬁed by reviewing patient records and talking with a
ﬂoor nurse if needed. Patients determined to be eligible
were visited by the research nurse who explained the study
and enrolled patients who were interested in participating.
After enrollment and baseline data collection, patients were
immediately randomized to the study group and notiﬁed
of whether they were in the intervention or control group
so they would know whether to expect a visit from a PC
provider.
Power calculations were done to identify a goal sample
size using mean baseline values of summary scores from 26
pilot study patients for each of the three study data collection
instruments. Calculations assumed an a of 0.05 and 80%
power. Results indicated a total sample size of 500 (250 per
group) would be sufﬁcient to detect an effect size (Cohen’s d)
of 0.25, which equates to a minimum detectable mean dif-
ferences between intervention and control groups of 1.5
points in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), 6.4
points in the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure (MLHF)
Questionnaire, and 3.3 points in the Edmonton Symptom
Assessment Scale (ESAS).
Patient recruitment began in April 2012 and ended in
February 2013. Of the 822 patients screened, 547 were eli-
gible and 470 (86%) were approached. Of those approached,
232 were enrolled (49%) (Fig. 1). Of the 116 intervention
patients, 4 withdrew from the study at the time the provider
came to the room because they changed their mind. An ad-
ditional 11 intervention patients did not receive the inter-
vention because the PC team was unable to conduct the
consultation prior to the patient’s discharge. Thus 13% of
those initially randomized to the intervention group did not
get the intervention. There were 19 deaths during the study
period and 14 withdrawals from the study. Most of the
withdrawals came in the form of refusals to respond to mailed
surveys. Because PC could not ethically be withheld from
subjects, n = 8 patients in the control group received inpatient
PC consults via standard care.
Intervention
The intervention followed the standard process of the hos-
pital PC team. After patients were randomized to the inter-
vention group, an order for PC was immediately entered, and
triaged by the PC team with a goal of conducting the PC consult
within 24 hours of the order. Providers did an initial consult and
then determined whether further appointments were necessary
and discussed that with the patient. The study intervention
differed from the standard PC process in two ways. First,
baseline study measures of symptom burden, depression, and
QOL were available to the providers to review at the time of the
consultation. Second, the study paid only for the initial PC
consultation and any subsequent visits were billed to the pa-
tient’s insurance as standard care. This information about billing
was shared with patients during the consent process. Actions of
PC providers during visits generally included assessment of
symptom burdens; emotional, spiritual, and psychosocial as-
pects of care; coordination of care orders; recommendations for
change in current or future treatment; referrals; and future care
planning assessment and discussions.
The comprehensive ACP process examined as an outcome
was not conducted by the PC providers but may have been
introduced and encouraged as part of the PC consult. All HF
patients receive a referral to the ACP process through their
discharge orders. Those who had not completed the process
received a call postdischarge offering the ACP process. The
ACP process, described in detail elsewhere,23 is often referred
to as disease-speciﬁc ACP. This version of ACP uses a trained
facilitator to guide communication between patients and their
caregivers regarding patient values and goals for treatment in
speciﬁc scenarios related to progression of their disease. The
process usually takes place in their home with their family
members who may serve as proxies for future health care de-
cisions. The process includes completion of a health directive,
a disease-speciﬁc plan and goals that are documented in the
medical record, and identiﬁcation of needed resources.
Data collection
This study and use of patient data for this project was ap-
proved by the Allina Health Institutional Review Board. Study
data came from two sources: patient self-reported measures
and EHR data. Self-reported measures were collected using
INPATIENT PALLIATIVE CARE FOR HEART FAILURE
135

three questionnaires to assess depression, QOL, and symp-
tom burden. Baseline self-reported measures were collected
by the research nurse at the time of enrollment either by
allowing the patient to complete the questionnaires them-
selves or by reading aloud the questions to the patient and
completing the forms depending on patient preferences. The
same questionnaires were administered via mailed surveys at
1 and 3 months after enrollment. Patients who did not return
mailed surveys within a week after the 1- or 3-month follow-
up date were called by the research nurse and encouraged to
return the survey or were offered the option to complete the
survey over the phone. Up to three follow-up phone calls
were made.
EHR data were extracted after the study was complete.
Each participant had an order indicating study participation
and randomization outcome. Outcome measures from the
EHR were excluded for the patients who withdrew from the
study, depending on time of withdrawal.

Data measures and deﬁnitions
The ESAS was used to measure symptom burden, the PHQ-
9 assessed depression symptoms, and the MLHF was used to
measure QOL. The ESAS24 was created to assess symptoms of
patients receiving PC. The ESAS rates ten symptoms (pain,
tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite,
well-being, shortness of breath, and ‘‘other’’) using a visual
scale line with labels of ‘‘none’’ at 0 and ‘‘worst possible’’ at
10. The scores from each of the ﬁrst nine items are combined to
create a summary distress score. The instrument showed pos-
itive results for internal consistency, criterion, and concurrent
validity as well as test-retest correlation at 1 day.24,25 The
ESAS is recommended for use with HF patients.19
The PHQ-9 is a brief, validated instrument used widely in
clinical and research settings to assess risk for depres-
sion.26,27 The PHQ-9 has been used in research on HF pa-
tients.28,29 PHQ-9 questions address the previous 2 weeks and
ask about physical and mood symptoms of depression that
align with diagnostic criteria. Responses indicate how often
symptoms were experience and each item is scored from 0
(‘‘not at all’’) to 3 (‘‘every day or nearly every day’’).
The MLHF Questionnaire30 was created to be represen-
tative of the ways HF and treatments can affect key physical,
emotional, social, and mental dimensions of QOL. The in-
strument has high reliability for repeated measures, internal
consistency, and high reliability between in-person and
telephone data collection.30–32 The MLHF contains 21 items
that assess how much a person’s HF has affected many as-
pects of their life during the prior month. Responses range
from 0 (‘‘no’’) to 5 (‘‘very much’’). In addition to a summary
score, the instrument has physical dimension and emotional
dimension scores.
For all three instruments and individual components of the
instruments, we calculated change from baseline to 1 month
and baseline to 3 months by subtracting the follow-up value
from the baseline value. For all of the instruments we used, a
higher number is an indication of worse severity in the
measure. A positive value for the calculated change from
baseline indicates an improvement in that measure since
baseline while a negative value in the change measure would
indicate a worsening in the severity of that measure.
Readmissions were deﬁned as an inpatient readmission for
any cause within 30 days; hospice use was any hospice ad-
mission within 6 months. ACP was deﬁned as documented
completion of the disease-speciﬁc ACP process in the record
within 6 months of the study hospitalization.
Data extracted from the EHR included patient character-
istics (age, gender, race, marital status, prior recent hospi-
talizations as a measure of disease severity), measures of the
intervention (number of PC visits, date of PC consultation),
and secondary outcomes (ACP, readmissions, mortality, and
hospice use). Mortality and hospice data were also collected
from the study patient tracking database as these were
sometimes identiﬁed when calling patients to follow up on
surveys.
Analysis
All analysis was conducted using SPSS version 18 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). Analysis used an intention-to-treat model
including all patients regardless of amount of intervention
received. Baseline values were compared between the study
groups using v2 tests for categorical measures and t tests to
compare mean values of continuous measures. The compar-
ison of change from baseline to the follow-up periods was
conducted using general linear regression models with ad-
justment for age, gender, and marital status. Survival analysis
using proportional hazards regression was conducted to ex-
amine outcomes of 30-day inpatient readmissions, ACP
completion, hospice admission, and mortality (all within 6
months). These models were adjusted for age, gender, and
marital status. Analysis on ACP completion excluded people
who had already completed the process prior to the study.
Results
Baseline demographics were comparable across the study
groups with the exception of age (Table 1). Patients in the
intervention group were on average 5.1 years older than pa-
tients in the control group. Inpatient and emergency depart-
ment admissions and total inpatient length of stay in the 6
months prior to the study were compared as proxy measures
for disease severity, but no differences were found between
the two groups for these measures. Additionally, there were
no differences at baseline between the groups on the three
primary outcome summary measures. Individual symptom
components from the ESAS were examined as well and the
only measure with different baseline results was tiredness,
with the mean being 0.8 points higher in the intervention
group ( p = 0.03).
Among the 101 patients receiving the PC intervention, 80
received 1 visit from the PC team, 13 received the initial
consult plus 1 additional visit, and 8 received a total of 3 or
more visits. Some patients were referred to receive visits
from the team social worker (n = 10) or chaplain (n = 5) in
addition to visits from the PC provider.
Outcomes at 1 and 3 months show larger improvement on
all three summary outcomes in the intervention group than
the control group after adjustment for age, gender, and
marital status (Table 2). The mean change in the intervention
group was 3.69 points more than that in the control group on
the ESAS Distress score at 1 month and 4.31 points higher at
3 months. Symptoms showing statistically signiﬁcant im-
provement include shortness of breath, anxiety, and tiredness
at both time periods and pain at 3 months only. Shortness of
breath and tiredness had the largest improvement compared
with the control group. The PHQ-9 summary score was sig-
niﬁcantly different at both times with a 1.42-point higher
improvement in the intervention group compared with the
control group at 1 month and 0.72 points at 3 months. None of
the individual items showed signiﬁcant differences between
the two groups.
The intervention group improvement on the MLHF total
score was 4.92 points higher than in the control group at 1
month and 3.06 points higher at 3 months. At 1 month, the
biggest difference was in the physical subscale, which im-
proved 3.51 points more in the intervention group, whereas
the emotional difference was 0.96. At 3 months, the emo-
tional score change was 1.72 points higher and the physical
score change was 1.2 points higher in the intervention group
compared with the control group.
When change in total summary scores (Table 2) was ex-
amined as a percent of the total mean baseline values (in Table
1), the percent of additional improvement from baseline
INPATIENT PALLIATIVE CARE FOR HEART FAILURE
137

experienced by the intervention group was 11% for the ESAS
(3.69/32.7), 17% for PHQ-9, and 10% for the MLHF.
Results of the survival analysis (Table 3) found no sig-
niﬁcant associations between study group assignment and 30-
day inpatient readmission, hospice use, or death within 6
months after adjustment for age, gender, and marital status.
Those in the intervention group were 2.87 times more likely
to have completed the disease-speciﬁc ACP process within 6
months.
Discussion
This study contributes to the growing literature reporting
that PC may improve symptom burden, depression, and QOL.
Speciﬁcally, this study found signiﬁcant associations with
inpatient visits and improvements in summary measures for
the three outcomes over a short time period in HF patients.
The differences identiﬁed in the current study are from an
intervention conducted in the context of short lengths of stay
in an inpatient setting with many patients receiving only one
visit with the PC provider. As such, the signiﬁcant results at
1 and 3 months are promising for the role of inpatient PC for
HF patients. However, it is unclear on how changes of these
levels translate into experiences of patients. An improve-
ment of 5 points in the MLHF has been identiﬁed as clini-
cally meaningful.30,33 The 1-month study mean difference
of 4.92 approaches this level. A decline of 5 points in the
PHQ-9 is considered a clinically meaningful response to
treatment for depressed patients.34 Our study found an in-
creased improvement of 1.42 in the intervention group,
which represents all participants regardless of depression
status.
To date, research on the integration of PC for HF has oc-
curred primarily in outpatient settings35–37 with a few inpatient

studies focused on feasibility.38,39 One outpatient study37
reported a 2.9-point greater improvement in the ESAS Dis-
tress score in the intervention group at 3 months, which is
comparable to the 3.7 point (1 month) and 4.3 point (3
months) improvement observed in our study. The same study
demonstrated mean improvement in the PHQ-9 to be 4.4
points higher in the intervention group, which is slightly
higher than the 1.4 and 0.7 differences reported here at 1 and 3
months. The baseline averages for the PHQ-9 in the outpatient
study were notably higher than ours however (14.2/14.5
versus 8.6/8.1 in the current study). The MLHF improvement
in the outpatient study (5.6 points more in intervention) are
comparable to the differences of 4.9 at 1 month and 3.1 at 3
months in the current study. The average age of study par-
ticipants in the outpatient study was 53.6 whereas ours was
73.4, and this stark age difference should be considered when
comparing results. However, both studies generally provide
evidence that PC visits likely improve symptom burden in
either setting.
In addition to the role of PC in addressing speciﬁc
symptoms burdens, PC is well known for eliciting goals of
care, and helping patients and their caregivers with com-
plex medical decision making.14 For HF patients, ACP is
one tool to help patients in this process.23 A referral to ACP
is a standard part of the discharge order set for HF patients
at this institution but may not be sufﬁcient to result in
participation without a discussion about the process. In-
deed, results indicate patients in the intervention were
more likely to complete the ACP process after discharge,
most likely based on discussions about the ACP process
and recommendation from the PC provider during the in-
tervention. Completion of the ACP process focuses on
enabling proxies to be able to make decisions in alignment
with patient preferences and documents more detailed
preferences in the medical record than could be done with a
typical advance directive. Completion of the ACP process
for HF patients is also associated with increased hospice
use at the end of life.23
One of the challenges to implementing the current study
was limited PC provider time. This resulted in some patients
assigned to the intervention group not receiving a PC consult
and also prohibited the study team from incorporating out-
patient PC follow-up visits into the intervention. The study
was stopped before reaching the desired sample size because
of increased referrals to PC as part of usual care in the
hospital. Future models may beneﬁt by combining inpatient
and outpatient PC. Advantages of outpatient follow-up care
include: follow-up on medical orders or referrals started in
the inpatient setting, establishing the relationships with pa-
tients and families that enable comprehensive ACP, and
improved patient contact to assess changes in symptoms. A
model that combines inpatient and outpatient PC delivery
would build on prior work supporting the association of
outpatient PC with improved symptom burden for a variety
of conditions.36,37
Limitations
There are several limitations to this study that should be
considered when interpreting results. First, by not achieving
the original intended sample size of 500 subjects, the study
may be underpowered and the randomization process may
not have sufﬁciently distributed patient characteristics evenly
between study conditions. We were able to adjust analysis for
the characteristics we could measure, but there may be ad-
ditional differences that we were not able to measure or ad-
dress in the analysis. Second, the intervention effect may
have been attenuated by the patients assigned to PC who did
not ultimately receive the intervention, either because they
withdrew or because the PC team did not conduct the consult
due to work load. Additionally, a subset of control patients
(8) received some PC during the study hospitalization. These
limitations are the product of conducting research in an ap-
plied setting.
Losses to follow-up resulted from patient withdrawal,
death, and nonresponse to the survey. It is unknown how
this may have altered outcomes. Additionally, in assessing
readmission and hospice use, we were limited to information
on readmissions that took place within our health system,
were documented by providers within our system, or were
identiﬁed by the research nurse during follow-up calls. It is
possible that patients were admitted to hospitals or hospice
care external to our health system, and it is not possible to
know whether the distribution of missing information on
health services outside our system was evenly distributed
across the study conditions.
Conclusion
This study contributes to the growing evidence that PC
may improve symptom burden, depressive symptoms, and
QOL in HF patients. The study also provided evidence that
interactions with PC providers were associated with in-
creased participation in ACP. Further research is needed to
determine how best to provide PC to HF patients in a co-
ordinated manner across both inpatient and outpatient
settings in ways that achieve clinically meaningful long-
term improvement in symptom burden, depression, and
QOL.
