 I
n the United States, COPD is the leading cause of 
respiratory-related deaths and is the third overall 
leading cause of death. 1 COPD often causes a pro-
gressive decline in quality of life and places patients 
at risk for acute respiratory failure that can require 
intensive care. Currently, there is no consensus on 
when discussions about preferences for end-of-
life care should take place with these patients. The 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory 
Society guidelines on COPD recommend these dis-
cussions occur for patients with advanced disease 
while they are clinically stable.  2   Studies show the 
majority of patients with COPD would like to discuss 
their preferences for end-of-life care with clini-
cians, yet less than one-third have done so. 3,4 Studies 
examining patients dying with COPD or lung cancer 
have shown that patients with COPD receive more 
resource-intensive care that is consistent with preser-
vation of life, including greater number of ICU days, 
and less focus on palliation of symptoms than patients 
 Objective:  Patients with COPD consistently express a desire to discuss end-of-life care with clini-
cians, but these discussions rarely occur. We assessed whether an intervention using patient-
speciﬁ c feedback about preferences for discussing end-of-life care would improve the occurrence 
and quality of communication between patients with COPD and their clinicians. 
 Methods:  We performed a cluster-randomized trial of clinicians and patients from the outpatient 
clinics at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Using self-reported questionnaires, 
we assessed patients’ preferences for communication, life-sustaining therapy, and experiences at 
the end of life. The intervention clinicians and patients received a one-page patient-speciﬁ c feed-
back form, based on questionnaire responses, to stimulate conversations. The control group com-
pleted questionnaires but did not receive feedback. Patient-reported occurrence and quality of 
end-of-life communication (QOC) were assessed within 2 weeks of a targeted visit. Intention-to-
treat regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations to account for 
clustering of patients within clinicians. 
 Results:  Ninety-two clinicians contributed 376 patients. Patients in the intervention arm reported 
nearly a threefold higher rate of discussions about end-of-life care (unadjusted, 30% vs 11%; 
 P  , .001). Baseline end-of-life communication was poor (intervention group QOC score, 23.3; 
95% CI, 19.9-26.8; control QOC score, 19.2; 95% CI, 15.9-22.4). Patients in the intervention arm 
reported higher-quality end-of-life communication that was statistically signiﬁ cant, although the 
overall improvement was small (Cohen effect size, 0.21). 
 Conclusions:  A one-page patient-speciﬁ c feedback form about preferences for end-of-life care 
and communication improved the occurrence and quality of communication from patients’ 
perspectives.

COPD receive most of their care in the outpatient 
setting where discussions about end-of-life care could 
occur without concomitant stressors, such as acute 
dyspnea and anxiety. We sought to improve the 
occurrence and quality of end-of-life communication 
with a simple communication intervention using a 
patient-speciﬁ c feedback form designed to facili-
tate communication about end-of-life care between 
patients with COPD and their clinicians in the outpa-
tient setting. 
 Materials and Methods 
 Study Design 
 We performed a clustered-randomized trial of clinicians and 
their patients. The unit of randomization was at the clinician level 
with patients clustered by clinician. Patients and clinicians were 
enrolled from January 2004 to November 2007 at two Veterans 
Affairs (VA) facilities: a university-afﬁ liated tertiary referral med-
ical center and a predominantly nonteaching outpatient facility. 
All participants provided informed consent. The study protocol 
was approved by the institutional review board of the University 
of Washington (#24803). 
 Participants 
 Subjects included clinicians and patients with COPD. Both 
physician and nonphysician clinicians were included from the pri-
mary care and chest clinics. Patients were required to have COPD 
as deﬁ ned by the GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstruc-
tive Lung Disease) criteria 14 and identify a participating clinician 
being primarily responsible for their COPD care. Patients were 
excluded for cognitive dysfunction, language barriers, or severe 
psychiatric disorders. 
 Randomization 
 We used stratiﬁ ed random sampling procedures to assign clini-
cians to either the intervention or control group. Study investiga-
tors and staff administering outcome measures were blinded to 
treatment assignment. 
 Data Collection 
 All patients self-completed baseline instruments with research 
assistants available to assist with completion of questionnaires. 
Baseline information included: (1) the Quality of Communication 
(QOC) questionnaire, 11,15 (2) the Preferences for Dying and Death 
questionnaire, 16,17 (3) the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire, 18 
(4) preferences for communication about end-of-life care and 
patient-speciﬁ c barriers and facilitators to this communication, 19,20 
(5) preferences for life-sustaining treatments, 19,20 and (6) socio-
demographic information. 
 Intervention Content 
 The theoretical foundation for this intervention was social cog-
nitive theory, and the intervention was designed to increase the 
self-efﬁ cacy of clinicians and patients for discussing end-of-life 
care. 21-23 The intervention was incorporated into usual clinical 
visits. We generated an individualized one-page patient-speciﬁ c 
feedback form that was distributed to clinicians who were ran-
domized to the intervention and to their patients ( Fig 1 ). The 
with lung cancer. 5 This focus on preservation of life 
occurs despite evidence that patients with COPD 
have similar preferences for end-of-life care as patients 
with lung cancer, and most state they prefer care 
focused on comfort. 6,7 
 Most interventions designed to improve commu-
nication about end-of-life care have been disap-
pointing. The Study to Understand Prognoses and 
Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments 
(SUPPORT), a multicenter randomized trial, was 
designed but failed to improve the quality of commu-
nication and delivery of end-of-life care in the inpa-
tient setting. More recently, experiential skills-building 
communication training has been shown to improve 
clinicians’ skills at communication about end-of-life 
care. 8,9   However, these efforts are expensive, time-
consuming, and have not yet been shown to improve 
patient-assessed outcomes. A randomized trial of 
elderly hospitalized patients showed that advance 
care planning improved satisfaction of care for 
patients and families, reduced intensity of care at the 
end of life, and reduced stress, anxiety, and depres-
sion in families of deceased patients. 10 However, the 
planning sessions required an additional visit by a 
trained facilitator and took a median of 60 min. These 
studies suggest that interventions to improve com-
munication about end-of-life care may improve 
patient and family outcomes and reduced intensity of 
care at the end of life, but practical ways to imple-
ment these interventions in the outpatient setting are 
lacking. 
 When clinicians do talk with patients with COPD 
about end-of-life care, these conversations often occur 
in response to acute deterioration when patients, 
family, and clinicians are coping with balancing the 
immediate need for medical care and the potential 
burdens and outcomes of care. 11-13 Yet, patients with

their surrogate(s). On the day of an ordinarily scheduled clinic 
visit, we provided the patient-speciﬁ c feedback form to clinicians 
and patients in the intervention group without endorsements to 
use during the clinic visit. Neither physicians nor patients in the 
control group received the patient-speciﬁ c feedback forms at any 
time. 
 Outcome Measures 
 All patients were surveyed at 2 weeks after the targeted clinic 
visit, and study staff members contacting patients were blinded 
to treatment group assignment. The previously validated quality 
of end-of-life communication score was our primary outcome 
measure (QOC). The QOC ranges between 0 and 100, with higher 
scores indicating better communication. 11,15 As secondary out-
comes, we assessed whether patients reported the occurrence of 
discussions about end-of-life preferences between themselves 
and either their clinician or their surrogate. 
patient-speciﬁ c feedback form was generated using an automated, 
computerized process that selected the patient’s self-reported 
responses, including perspectives about whether their physician 
would know the types of care they desired, their desire for com-
munication about advance care planning, patient-speciﬁ c barriers 
and facilitators to communication about end-of-life care, prefer-
ences for CPR and mechanical ventilation, and the severity of 
their airﬂ ow limitation. We provided the patient-speciﬁ c highest-
ranked barrier and facilitator to end-of-life communication along 
with an introductory sentence that clinicians could use to help 
lower the threshold to initiate conversations. Last, we provided 
the patient’s three most important preferences for end-of-life 
experiences. 
 Timing of Intervention Delivery 
 For patients in the intervention group, we mailed the one-page 
patient-speciﬁ c feedback form to patients to review and share with 
 Figure 1. Example of clinician patient-speciﬁ c feedback form.

 Results 
 Patient and Clinician Characteristics 
 Of the 152 clinicians who were willing to participate, 
92 were able to contribute patients and were included 
in the study. Clinicians were primarily staff clini-
cians (64.1%) and included physicians (69.6%) and 
independent midlevel practitioners (30.4%). Of the 
92 clinicians, 66.3% practiced in the general inter-
nal medicine clinics and/or women’s clinic, 26.1% in 
the pulmonary clinic, and 7.6% in the geriatric clinics. 
These clinicians contributed 376 patients: 182 to 
the control group and 194 to the intervention group. 
As seen in  Figure 2 , a total of 306 patients completed 
the study (155 control group, 151 intervention group). 
Clinician and patient characteristics are presented 
 Analyses 
 We used the principle of “intention to treat” for all analyses. 
Because we randomized clinicians rather than patients, we choose 
a priori to adjust for baseline patient characteristics as our pri-
mary analysis as well as to account for clustering by clinicians. We 
chose those clinical characteristics based on whether the factor 
might inﬂ uence clinicians’ likelihood of having discussions about 
end-of-life care. We adjusted our primary analyses for baseline 
end-of-life communication scale, age, log age, smoking status, 
and FEV 1 . For the patients who were lost to follow-up, or those 
who had missing covariate information, we imputed these values 
with the “imputation using chained equations” program in STATA 
10 (StataCorp). To demonstrate the effects of missing data, we 
examined both unimputed and imputed results for each model. 
The effect of the intervention was assessed using a cross-sectional 
time-series generalized estimating equations regression, with an 
exchangeable covariance matrix. All models accounted for the 
clustering of patients within clinician.

justed analyses, baseline quality of communication in 
both treatment and control groups was poor (inter-
vention group QOC score, 23.3; 95% CI, 19.9-26.8; 
and control QOC score, 19.2; 95% CI, 15.9-22.4). At 
follow-up, the quality of communication remained 
relatively poor for both groups (intervention group 
QOC score, 34.0; 95% CI, 28.5-39.4; and control 
QOC score, 25.5; 95% CI, 20.4-30.5), with some 
improvement in both groups but a larger improve-
ment in the intervention group. To assess the effect 
of the intervention, using our a priori primary ana-
lytic plan with an intention-to-treat approach, pre-
speciﬁ ed covariates, and a prespeciﬁ ed imputation 
method, we found that the intervention was associ-
ated with a statistically signiﬁ cant improvement in 
the quality of communication (difference, 5.74 points; 
 P  5  .03; Cohen effect size, 0.21) ( Table 2 ). 
 In addition, our results were generally consistent 
regardless of whether we imputed missing data or 
in  Table 1 . Patients in the two arms differed in regard 
to a few baseline clinical characteristics ( Table 1 ). A 
greater proportion of the control group reported 
at-risk drinking as measured by an Alcohol Use 
Disorders Identiﬁ cation Test-Alcohol Consumption 
Questions (AUDIT-C) score  . 4 (24.7% vs 13.6%, 
 P  5  .01), and a greater proportion of the interven-
tion group reported hypertension (68.9% vs 55.5%, 
 P  5  .001). There were no differences in baseline 
patient characteristics with respect to whether 
patients completed the study (n  5  306, 81.4%) or were 
lost to follow-up (n  5  70, 18.6%) (data not shown). 
Patient ratings of the burden of study participation 
were the same in both groups ( Table 1 ).

report having “ever had” discussions with their clini-
cians (range of absolute difference between interven-
tion and control, 23.6%-28.2%;  P  , .0001 for all 
models) (primary analysis results shown in  Table 2 ). 
When framed in the context of “since the last time we 
talked,” the intervention had a small but nonsigniﬁ -
cant effect on discussion between patients and surro-
gates (range of absolute differences, 5%-8%;  P  . .05 
for all models) (primary analysis results shown in 
 Table 2 ). Participants in the intervention arm, how-
ever, reported having had discussions with surrogates 
about the types of treatments they wanted at a signif-
icantly higher rate than control subjects (range abso-
lute differences, 10%-12% higher;  P  , .01 for all 
models) (primary analysis results shown in  Table 2 ). 
 Assessment of Individual Items of the QOC Score: 
 Last, we were interested whether individual items on 
the QOC score were signiﬁ cantly higher as the result 
of the intervention and examined the individual items 
of the end-of-life quality of communication scale 
after the intervention, controlling for the patient 
assessment of this item prior to the intervention 
( Table 3 ). On average, discussions about patients’ 
feelings about getting sicker and asking about spiri-
tual or religious beliefs received statistically higher 
ratings. On the other hand, topics that focused on 
the details of getting sicker, prognosis, what dying 
might be like, involving family in discussions, and 
asking about things important to the patient did not 
improve. 
 Discussion 
 This relatively simple intervention using a patient-
speciﬁ c feedback form increased the occurrence of 
patient-reported discussions about end-of-life care 
between patients, surrogates, and their clinicians. 
The intervention also improved the quality of com-
munication about end-of-life care, although the 
improvement was modest as assessed by the Cohen 
effect size. The intervention was designed to incorpo-
rate patient-centered preferences for communication 
about end-of-life care and promote this communica-
tion between patients, surrogates, and clinicians. To 
enhance translation into practice, the intervention 
was designed to ﬁ t within the context of an outpatient 
clinic and was designed not to require additional 
clinic visits to discuss advance care planning. Our 
results suggest that providing patient-speciﬁ c prefer-
ences in a one-page feedback form is an effective 
intervention to improve the occurrence of advanced 
care planning discussions in the outpatient setting. 
However, our results suggest that even though these 
discussions occurred more frequently and were rated 
as higher quality by patients, improvements in the 
adjusted for baseline patient characteristics. For 
example, accounting for baseline QOC scores and 
clustering by clinician, but without adjustment for 
covariates or imputation, we found a statistically sig-
niﬁ cant improvement in the quality of communica-
tion (difference, 6.95 points for intervention vs control; 
 P  5  .01). Similarly, in models that only adjusted for 
baseline QOC scores and were clustered by clinician, 
imputation of missing data had a small effect on the 
magnitude of the intervention (difference, 6.14 points; 
 P for intervention vs control  5  .02). Furthermore, 
restricting to only those individuals with complete 
data and adjusting for prespeciﬁ ed variables, the 
effect of the intervention on improving quality of 
communication was similar to our primary analysis; 
however, the effect was no longer statistically sig-
niﬁ cant (difference, 4.85 points;  P for intervention 
vs control  5  0.11). Among participants in the control 
arm using our prespeciﬁ ed modeling approach noted 
here, we found no signiﬁ cant improvement in the 
QOC scores between participant’s pre-visit and post-
visit QOC scores ( P  5  .23). 
 Secondary Outcome Measures 
 Effect of Intervention on Occurrence of Patient 
Communication With Clinicians and Surrogates: 
 Participants frequently reported that they would like 
to discuss end-of-life care preferences with their cli-
nician (67.7%); however, at baseline only a minority 
reported having had a previous discussion (14.6%). 
Since their last clinic visit, patients in the interven-
tion arm reported nearly threefold higher likelihood 
of having an end-of-life discussion with an absolute 
difference of 18.6% ( P  , .001) ( Fig 3 ). Using similar 
modeling approaches as described here, we found 
regardless of modeling approach that participants in 
the intervention arm were signiﬁ cantly more likely to

about treatment preferences at their last clinic visit.

and topics. Although our simple intervention can 
increase the quality and occurrence of communica-
tion about end-of-life care, major improvements in 
the quality of this communication will likely require 
experiential skill-building training for clinicians. 8 
 One reason that communication about end-of-life 
care among patients with COPD may be particularly 
difﬁ cult is the overall uncertainty of life expectancy. 7 
Unlike diagnoses such as cancer, prognostication for 
patients with COPD is difﬁ cult. For example, 5 days 
prior to death, the SUPPORT prognostic model pre-
dicted that 50% of patients would be alive at 6 month. 7 
Among patients with very severe impairment as 
assessed by BODE (BMI, airﬂ ow obstruction, dysp-
nea, and exercise capacity index) scores, 50% of 
patients were still alive at 3 years. 27 Given the uncer-
tainty about prognosis and the chronicity of this 
disease, developing and teaching effective commu-
nication skills regarding advance care planning for 
COPD represent an important challenge and a useful 
paradigm for chronic, life-limiting illness with uncer-
tainty regarding prognosis. 
 There are some important limitations to our study. 
First, there was a slightly higher dropout in the inter-
vention group (22% vs 15%,  P  5  .6). It is possible that 
the content of the intervention made the intervention 
patients uncomfortable, and, therefore, they with-
drew at a greater rate. However, we asked the same 
questions of both intervention and control groups, 
and participants rated the burden of the study the 
same in both the intervention and control groups. A 
possible explanation is that study staff had more con-
tact with the intervention group by virtue of the addi-
tional contact at the time of the target clinic visit to 
give the patient-speciﬁ c feedback, thus allowing an 
overall quality of end-of-life communication were 
modest. 
 SUPPORT demonstrated that, in comparison with 
patients with lung cancer, patients with COPD 
received care more often directed at prolongation of 
life despite having similar preferences for end-of-life 
care. 7 A comparison among US veterans in the last 
6 months of life found that patients with COPD were 
much more likely to be admitted to the ICU and have 
signiﬁ cantly greater lengths of stay than patients with 
lung cancer. 5 Moreover, there was dramatic geo-
graphic variation in ICU use among patients with 
COPD that was not present among patients with lung 
cancer, suggesting a lack of consensus about treat-
ing patients with COPD at the end of life. Among 
patients with cancer, communication about end-of-
life care has been associated with decreased life-
sustaining treatments at the end of life, increased 
quality of life at the end of life, and no increase in 
symptoms of anxiety or depression. 24,25 Improving the 
occurrence of these conversations is an important 
initial step to help preserve patient autonomy and 
improve the quality of end-of-life care. 
 This study also conﬁ rms the results of others dem-
onstrating poor quality of communication about end-
of-life care between patients with COPD and their 
clinicians. 3,26 Topics that patients consistently noted 
as being absent from discussions included asking 
about religious beliefs, talking about feelings about 
getting sicker, what dying might be like, and talking 
about how long they may have to live. Future inter-
ventions will likely need to not only integrate pro-
cesses to improve the frequency with which these 
concepts are discussed but also focus on improving 
how clinicians communicate these difﬁ cult concepts

additional opportunity for patients to withdraw. Sec-
ond, this study was performed exclusively within a VA 
facility, potentially limiting the generalizability for 
implementation in systems outside the VA. Third, 
although we did not exclude women, the few women 
included in this study may limit inferences for women. 
Fourth, the study was designed to assess whether 
patients had conversations at one target clinic visit. 
We did not continue to assess whether new or addi-
tional conversations were stimulated by the interven-
tion. Future studies should evaluate the sustainability 
of an intervention to change clinicians’ behavior 
about discussing end-of-life care. Fifth, because of 
the nature of the content of the questionnaires and our 
desire to approximate clinical practice, patients were 
not asked to complete questions that were left unan-
swered. This produced missing data in a number of 
our measures. However, comparison of unimputed 
intention-to-treat model with imputed models pro-
duced similar results. Sixth, the clustered randomized 
design increased the risk of differences in distribu-
tions of baseline patient characteristics. We used 
adjusted analyses to help address these differences. 
Finally, we did not follow these individuals to assess 
whether the intervention had effects on the actual 
delivery of care, such as the number of ICU visits or 
referrals to palliative care services. 
 Providing high-quality care is predicated not only 
on understanding patients’ preferences for care but 
also on attempting to align those preferences with 
actual delivery of health care. We have demonstrated 
that a relatively simple intervention can engage 
patients, surrogates, and clinicians to signiﬁ cantly 
increase the number of conversations about end-of-
life care, but additional studies and more in-depth 
interventions are likely needed to further improve 
the quality of the communication that occurs between 
patients and clinicians. Current health-care training 
often neglects the development of high-quality 
communication skills, leaving trainees to learn by 
experience. 28,29 Health-care training curricula need to 
be expanded to include formal and experiential skill-
building education about how to communicate difﬁ -
cult topics, including how to prepare patients and 
their families for decisions about end-of-life care. In 
the meantime, a relatively simple patient-speciﬁ c 
feedback form can increase the quantity and quality 
of communication about end-of-life care for patients 
with COPD.
