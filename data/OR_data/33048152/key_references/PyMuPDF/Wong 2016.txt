ABSTRACT
Objective To examine the effects of home-based
transitional palliative care for patients with end-stage
heart failure (ESHF) after hospital discharge.
Methods This was a randomised controlled trial
conducted in three hospitals in Hong Kong. The
recruited subjects were patients with ESHF who had
been discharged home from hospitals and referred for
palliative service, and who met the speciﬁed inclusion
criteria. The interventions consisted of weekly home
visits/telephone calls in the ﬁrst 4 weeks then monthly
follow-up, provided by a nurse case manager supported
by a multidisciplinary team. The primary outcome
measures were any readmission and count of
readmissions within 4 and 12 weeks after index
discharge, compared using χ2 tests and Poisson
regression, respectively. Secondarily, change in symptoms
over time between control and intervention groups were
evaluated using generalised estimating equation analyses
of data collected using the Edmonton Symptom
Assessment Scale (ESAS).
Results The intervention group (n=43) had a
signiﬁcantly lower readmission rate than the control
group (n=41) at 12 weeks (intervention 33.6% vs
control 61.0% χ2=6.8, p=0.009). The mean number
(SE) of readmissions for the intervention and control
groups was, respectively, 0.42 (0.10) and 1.10 (0.16)
and the difference was signiﬁcant (p=0.001). The
relative risk (CI) for 12-week readmissions for the
intervention group was 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88). There was
no signiﬁcant difference in readmissions between groups
at 4 weeks. However, when compared with the control
group, the intervention group experienced signiﬁcantly
higher clinical improvement in depression (45.9% vs
16.1%, p<0.05), dyspnoea (62.2% vs 29.0%, p<0.05)
and total ESAS score (73.0% vs 41.4%, p<0.05) at
4 weeks. There were signiﬁcant differences between
groups in changes over time in quality of life (QOL)
measured by McGill QOL (p<0.05) and chronic HF
(p<0.01) questionnaires.
Conclusions This study provides evidence of the
effectiveness of a postdischarge transitional care
palliative programme in reducing readmissions and
improving symptom control among patients with ESHF.

INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) is a worldwide health issue1 2
resulting in high mortality rates of 40% and 75%,
respectively, within the ﬁrst year3 and at 5 years4
after diagnosis. The treatment of chronic HF has
improved in the last decade, with updated national
guidelines for diagnosis and disease management.
Palliative care (PC) can be initiated when end-stage
HF (ESHF) is diagnosed,1 2 with the ratio of PC to
life-prolonging
care
gradually
increasing
when
patients are refractory to treatment.1 5
Patients with advanced HF experience marked
reductions in health-related quality of life (QOL).
The
three
most
prevalent
physical
symptoms
reported by these patients are fatigue, dyspnoea
and swelling of arms and legs.3 Psychologically,
patients with HF experience feelings of uncertainty
and fear since their conditions can change rapidly
and the feeling of death is imminent.6 Socially,
patients with HF feel isolated and lonely,6 and
regard themselves as a burden to their carers since
they often require assistance in daily living.7 These
patients,
with
complicated
issues
in
refractory
symptoms,
psychological
distress
and
difﬁcult
decision-making involving families, would beneﬁt
from a specialist PC team trained in these skills.8
However, PC is reported to be underused among
patients with HF.9 10
The reasons for low use of PC among patients
with
ESHF
are
multifactorial,
disease-related,
person-related and system-related.4 The unpredict-
able disease trajectories in HF make the prognosti-
cation of life span difﬁcult.11 Care providers,
including cardiologists and primary care physicians,
lack appreciation of the palliative concept and fail
to recognise specialist PC as a tangible service.12
Patients are often unaware of PC as a treatment
choice.2 At the system level, there is a lack of care
coordination in the specialties of HF and PC,4
which may be attributed to suboptimal trust and
rapport between providers.12 There need to be
clearer guidelines of how and when specialist PC
should
be
integrated
into
advanced
HF
management.12
PC has a long history among patients with
cancer. In the last decade, studies have emerged
using non-cancer and cancer patients as a study
population when testing the effects of PC models.
One of the earlier studies was conducted by
Brumley et al, who tested an in-home PC multidis-
ciplinary intervention programme among patients
with cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and
chronic heart failure (CHF), ﬁnding
signiﬁcant reductions in emergency room visits,
hospital days and costs compared with a usual care

group.11 A systematic review that examined studies involving
both cancer and non-cancer patients also showed that multidis-
ciplinary PC support can signiﬁcantly reduce readmissions, with
particularly strong evidence among the HF group.13
The models for current provision of PC for patients with HF
vary, with some hospital-based and others community-based.14
A current review showed that home-based PC interventions
among community HF subjects could reduce hospital admis-
sions and enhance symptom management.15 Another study,
testing the effects of clinic-based consultations, found that the
ability of patients with HF in symptom management was better
with more frequent clinic consultations.16 There is a lack of
studies exploring the effects of transitional care support for
patients with ESHF. Transitional care involves deliberately
designed programmes to provide proactive and continuous
support to patients returning home after hospital discharge with
the intensity and duration of activity events planned with evi-
dence support. Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of
transitional care programmes among medical patients in redu-
cing hospital readmissions.17 18 There is no previous transitional
programme designed for patients with ESHF and thus no empir-
ical results reporting its effects. The objective of this study was
to examine the effects of home-based transitional PC for
patients with ESHF after hospital discharge.
METHODS
Study design
This was a multiple-site randomised controlled trial involving
two arms. The intervention group received home visits/tele-
phone calls every week for the ﬁrst month and less frequently
during the subsequent months for a total of 12 months. This
study will report results of readmissions up to 12 weeks and
other outcomes up to 4 weeks, the initial endpoint after delivery
of the intensive intervention. Both groups received usual care,
which consisted of PC medical clinic consultation, discharge
advice on symptom management and medication and referrals if
appropriate (eg, home visits).
Setting and subjects
The study took place in three hospitals within the Hospital
Authority (HA), Hong Kong between May 2013 and December
2014. The HA is government funded and employs corporate
governance which aligns practice within the system. These three
hospitals were selected because there were established referral
systems between the medical/cardiac and PC teams. Subjects
who fulﬁlled the following criteria were recruited: (a) met two
of the following indicators identiﬁed as ESHF by the Prognostic
Indicator Guidance:19 (i) CHF New York Heart Association
(NYHA) stage III or IV, (ii) patient thought to be in the last year
of life by clinicians, (iii) repeated hospital admissions (three
within 1 year) with symptoms of HF and (iv) existence of phys-
ical/psychological symptoms despite optimal tolerated therapy;
(b) Cantonese-speaking; (c) living within the service area; (d)
contactable by phone and (e) referral accepted by PC team. The
exclusion criteria were: (a) discharged to institutions, (b) inabil-
ity to communicate, (c) diagnosed with severe psychiatric disor-
ders and (d) recruited to other programmes. An advanced
practice nurse (APN) helped to screen cases for eligibility (see
online supplementary material) and conﬁrmed the recruitment
with the physician. The patients were approached, and consent-
ing subjects signed a consent form. The responsible APN then
called the site investigator for a random assignment generated
by the computer software Research Randomizer. The investiga-
tor, who had no knowledge of the subject’s identity, provided
the
assignment
based
on
sequential
computer
numbers
(‘1’=control; ‘2’=study).
We assumed the effect of our study to be similar to that of a
previous study that used home-based palliative follow-up for
patients with end-stage organ failure.20 In that study, the
average number of 30-day readmissions was reduced from 2.23
to 1.25. By Lehr’s equation,21 a sample size of 29 per group
(=4/(2.230.5−1.250.5)2) is adequate to achieve 80% power with
a signiﬁcance level of 0.05. Taking into account a 20% dropout
rate, 35 subjects were needed per group.
Intervention
The
design
of
the
Transitional
Care
Palliative-ESHF
(TCP-ESHF) programme was based on two main conceptual
guides: the recommended principles of PC for patients with HF
and the 4Cs for transitional care model. For the principles of
PC, the team referenced composite guidelines drawn from
Scotland, Europe and Canada,5 22 which could be summarised
into the following six principles: (i) case management with peri-
odic review; (ii) discussion of end-of-life issues; (iii) multidiscip-
linary approach; (iv) staff development for communication,
cardiovascular and PC; (v) discussion of treatment preferences
and (vi) integrated model of care. The transitional care frame-
work was the 4Cs model tested and used by Wong et al with
general medical patients.17 18 The 4Cs are comprehensiveness,
continuity, coordination and collaboration in alignment with the
PC principles mentioned above in providing continuous and
coordinated
care
with
multidisciplinary
support.
Previous
studies17 18 have shown that a 4-week intervention with weekly
structured events provided a strong enough dose to bring about
effects.
The TCP-ESHF
was
delivered
by
nurse case
managers
(NCMs) who were qualiﬁed PC home nurses with experience of
caring for patients with HF. The NCMs were supported by the
PC physician in service delivery. Before a patient’s discharge,
the nurse met the patient/patient’s family to conduct a predis-
charge assessment. After discharge, the patient was followed up
in the ﬁrst 4 weeks as below:
Week 1—the NCM and trained volunteers (TVs) conducted a
home visit together.
Week 2—the NCM provided a telephone follow-up.
Week 3—the TVs conducted a home visit in pairs.
Week 4—the NCM provided a telephone follow-up.
After the ﬁrst 4 weeks, the subjects in the intervention group
received monthly home visits and telephone follow-up until the
end of 12 weeks. Based on the Omaha framework,17 the NCM
assessed patients’ needs in the environmental, psychosocial,
physiological and health-related behaviour domains and inter-
vened accordingly. The Omaha system was ﬁrst developed in the
USA and has been tested and used locally.17 18 At each of the
encounters, the NCM would set goals and develop a mutually
agreed care plan with the patients. The home visits, telephone
calls and referrals were governed by protocols to ensure a con-
sistent approach to care delivery. The NCM was assisted by TVs
who
were
nursing
students
trained
in
providing
patient
support.17 18 The NCMs and TVs received 18 and 9 h of train-
ing, respectively (see online supplementary material).
Placebo calls for the control group

Data collection and measures
Data were collected at discharge (O1), at the primary endpoint
at 4 weeks postdischarge (O2) and at the secondary endpoint at
12 weeks for readmission data. The clinical and readmission
data were extracted from the hospital information system. The
demographic and secondary data were collected by research
assistants who were trained and blind to the grouping. The
inter-rater reliability reached 0.90.
Baseline demographic and clinical data
The demographic data included age, gender, marital status, educa-
tion, employment, accommodation and economic status. The clin-
ical
data
included
aetiology,
classiﬁcation,
cardiac
surgical
intervention received, comorbidity, medications and length of stay.
Primary data
The primary data were readmissions within 4 and 12 weeks
after the index hospital discharge.
Secondary data
Symptom intensity was measured by the Edmonton Symptom
Assessment Scale (ESAS), which assesses eight symptoms: pain,
tiredness, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sense
of well-being and dyspnoea using a 0–100 mm visual analogue
scale with established validity and Cronbach’s α reliability of 0.8.23
Functional status was measured by the Palliative Performance
Scale (PPS), speciﬁcally designed for palliative patients11 to
reﬂect ﬁve physical aspects of palliative patients: ambulation,
activities, self-care, intake and consciousness level. It has a rating
scale from 100 (normal) to 0 (death) measured in 10% decre-
ments with an internal consistency Cronbach’s α of 0.83.11
QOL was measured by a palliative-speciﬁc scale, the McGill
quality of life questionnaire-Hong Kong (MQOL-HK) version
and
an
HF-speciﬁc
scale,
the
chronic
heart
failure
questionnaire-Chinese (CHQ) version. The MQOL-HK mea-
sures four domains (physical, psychological, existential and
support) on a numerical scale from 0 to 10, validated for local
use with a Cronbach’s α of 0.83.24 The CHQ is a Canadian
HF-speciﬁc QOL tool measuring 20 items on a 7-point Likert
scale representing four domains: dyspnoea, fatigue, emotional
status and mastery. It was translated into Chinese and validated
with a Cronbach’s α of 0.95.25
Satisfaction with care was measured by an 11-item question-
naire validated locally with test–retest reliability of 0.87.17
Data analysis
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were presented to describe the demo-
graphic and clinical variables. Poisson regression was used to
examine the mean difference in 28-day and 84-day readmission
between groups, and the relative risks for the intervention
group were examined. The between-group rates were compared
using the χ2 test. The generalised estimating equation (GEE) was
used to examine the group, time and interaction effects on the

secondary outcome variables. GEE was used because it treats
observations of longitudinal data as correlated, using robust SE
estimates to get valid inference.26 The proportion of patients
with improvement/deterioration/no change in symptoms (ESAS)
was calculated based on the minimal clinically important differ-
ence (MCID) cut-off reported in studies by Hui et al,27 28 and
differences across groups were examined using χ2 tests. Both
readmissions and MCID were computed based on actual data.
The principle of intention to treat was employed and all statis-
tical analyses were conducted using SPSS V.22.0 for Windows.
RESULTS
A total of 389 subjects were screened, with 305 excluded. The
remaining 84 eligible subjects were randomised. A total of 16
subjects were lost to follow-up (see ﬁgure 1). Table 1 displays
the demographic and clinical baseline data. The mean age of the
subjects was 78.3, with males (52.4%) slightly outnumbering
females. The demographic background of the two groups was
equivalent. There was no signiﬁcant between-group difference
in clinical parameters, including HF aetiology, mean left ven-

medications received, except for the NYHA Class (p=0.03).
The perceived health status (PPS and ESAS) at baseline were
equivalent in the two groups, and there was no signiﬁcant dif-
ference in their length of hospital stay.
The intervention group had a lower 4-week readmission rate
(intervention 20.9% vs control 29.3% χ2=4.41, p=0.79) and
mean number of readmissions (intervention 0.21 (SE 0.07) vs
control 0.41 (SE 0.10) p=0.097), but the difference was not sig-
niﬁcant. At 12 weeks, the readmission rate (intervention 33.6%
vs control 61.0% χ2=6.8, p=0.009) and mean number of read-
missions (intervention 0.42 (SE 0.10) vs control 1.10 (SE 0.16),
p=0.001) became signiﬁcantly lower for the intervention group
(see table 2). The relative risks (CI) for 4-week and 12-week
readmissions for the intervention group were, respectively, 0.81
(0.51 to 1.27) and 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88).
The
MCID
of
the
symptom
intensity
was
examined.
Compared with the control group, the intervention group
experienced signiﬁcantly higher clinical improvement in depres-
sion (45.9% vs 16.1%, p<0.05), dyspnoea (62.2% vs 29.0%,
p<0.05) and total score (73.0% vs 41.4%, p<0.05) (table 3).
Table 4 displays the results of the secondary outcome compar-
ing the baseline and week 4. There was no difference in func-
tional status (PPS) within or between groups over time. There
was some improvement in the symptom intensity of depression
and anxiety as measured by ESAS over time in the intervention
group, but there was no difference in improvement between
groups. Both measures of QOL, the Chronic heart-failure ques-
tionnaire
Chinese
(CHQC)
(p<0.01)
and
McGill
QOL
(p<0.05), showed a signiﬁcant difference in the change over
time between groups. When individual items were examined, all
achieved
statistically
signiﬁcant

with

effect, except for ‘fatigue’ in CHQC and ‘physical’ and ‘existen-
tial’ in McGill. The intervention group had signiﬁcantly higher
satisfaction with care than the control group (p<0.001).
DISCUSSION
This study adds to the evidence that an intensive 4-week transi-
tional home-based programme sustained by monthly follow-up
is effective in reducing readmissions, controlling symptoms and
enhancing QOL among patients with ESHF on returning home
after hospital discharge.
The design of the TCP-ESHF programme in this study con-
tained evidence-based elements identiﬁed by a current systematic
review that were found to be effective in reducing hospital read-
missions. They were the use of multicomponents in interven-
tions involving a multidisciplinary team in care delivery and
supporting clients to optimise capacity for self-care.29 Few tran-
sitional care studies have been conducted among patients with
ESHF. Brumley et al tested a palliative programme among non-
cancer patients, including HF and COPD subjects, ﬁnding that
an in-home PC group had higher satisfaction and fewer hospita-
lisations than a usual care group.11 This study obtained the
same results and was also consistent with other trials in demon-
strating that a home-based PC programme could enhance
QOL.1 12 As in other studies,1 9 dyspnoea and fatigue were two
common symptoms reported by subjects in this study. The
NCMs in this study were able to empower their patients in
symptom management, make adjustments to medications and
offer early referral if appropriate.11
18 Previous studies that
examined the effects of palliative home-based support focused
on patients in the community who were referred for home
care.11 20 This study shows that transitional care support after
an episode of hospitalisation enabled patients to reduce hospital
use and stay well in the community. Similar transitional care
programmes, led by professionals and supported by volunteers,
have proved cost-effective among general medical patients.30
Patients with ESHF have typical PC needs that include
symptom control and psychosocial support.31 The use of PC
among patients with HF is low,9 as reﬂected by the low statistics
that ranged from only 5% for non-cancer10 to 12% for HF32
users of hospice services. One of the challenges in referring
patients with HF to PC services is the unpredictable illness tra-
jectory of HF, which makes accurate prognostication difﬁcult.33
Advocacy of the PC approach in HF treatment guidelines helps
remind clinicians to adopt this approach when appropriate and
in the best interests of patients.32 The triggering of the palliative
approach needs the collaboration of both PC and medical spe-
cialists.9 This study beneﬁted from explicit referral guidelines
developed in the study sites, supported by the medical/cardiac
team and hospital management.
Stuart asserts that the alignment of ﬁnancial incentives
between specialties and across healthcare settings is important,
particularly when the provision of care needs to extend from

Heart failure and cardiomyopathies

hospital to home.32 Having an innovative infrastructure design
is important in helping to integrate the PC approach into the
continuum of HF care.4 The design of the TCP-ESHF achieved
the delivery of services that were comprehensive and coordi-
nated in collaboration with a team comprising professionals and
volunteers supporting patients with continuity. When the bio-
medical curative approach of adding years to life is no longer
possible, the holistic approach of PC to control symptoms and
address patients’ needs is a preferred alternative.4
This study has a number of limitations. The loss of follow-up
was high, which is not uncommon among palliative patients.
The rate was 24.4% and 14.0%, respectively, for the control
and intervention groups, the main reasons being death and
deterioration. The sample size was relatively small and there was
a signiﬁcantly higher NYHA class in the control compared with
the intervention group. The study was conducted in Hong
Kong, whose healthcare system differs from those in other
countries. Repeated studies should be conducted both within
and outside Hong Kong with larger sample sizes to conﬁrm the
internal and external validity of the ﬁndings. This study has
focused on administrative outcomes, namely hospital readmis-
sions. No existing studies have reported MCID for QOL, which
is an important outcome measure for palliative patients. This
study used symptom measures to calculate MCID, which fails to
reﬂect the clinically important overall well-being of the patients.
CONCLUSIONS
This study has provided evidence of the effects of a post-
discharge home-based palliative programme in reducing read-
missions and enhancing QOL among patients with ESHF. The
shifting of the focus from treatment to symptom control in the
continuum of care requires the support of both cardiologists
and PC physicians in building a referral mechanism and service
model in the delivery of care. Home care nurses who are experi-
enced in PC as well as HF symptom management are instrumen-
tal in providing continuity of care for patients immediately after
hospital discharge. The nurse’s access to both physician and
multidisciplinary team is essential in providing early interven-
tion when problems are detected.

Key messages
What is already known on this subject?
▸Palliative care enhances quality at the end of life among
patients with cancer.
▸Transitional care support after hospital discharge reduces
readmissions and enhances clients’ quality of life.
What might this study add?
▸Specialist palliative care is beneﬁcial to non-cancer patients
who are at the end-stage of organ failure.
▸Transitional care support, led by professionals supported by
volunteers, can reduce hospital readmissions, enhance
quality of life and achieve signiﬁcantly higher clinical
improvement in symptom control among patients with
end-stage heart failure.
How might this impact on clinical practice?
▸Patients with heart failure at an advanced stage and
refractory to medical therapy would beneﬁt from specialist
palliative care.
▸The deliberate design of transitional care support for
patients with end-stage heart failure requires organisational
support to develop clear referral guidelines between medical
and palliative care physicians, and mobilising resources to
ensure continuity of care extended from hospital to home.
