Abstract
Background: Breathlessness is the most common and intrusive symptom of advanced non-malignant respiratory
and cardiac conditions. The Breathlessness Intervention Service (BIS) is a multi-disciplinary complex intervention,
theoretically underpinned by a palliative care approach, utilising evidence-based non-pharmacological and
pharmacological interventions to support patients with advanced disease in managing their breathlessness. Having
published the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of BIS for patients with advanced cancer and their carers, we
sought to establish its effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, in advanced non-malignant conditions.
Methods: This was a single-centre Phase III fast-track single-blind mixed method RCT of BIS versus standard care for
breathless patients with non-malignant conditions and their carers. Randomisation was to one of two groups
(randomly permuted blocks). Eighty-seven patients referred to BIS were randomised (intervention arm n = 44;
control arm n = 43 received BIS after four-week wait); 79 (91 %) completed to key outcome measurement. The
primary outcome measure was 0–10 numeric rating scale for patient distress due to breathlessness at four weeks.
Secondary outcome measures were Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,
Client Service Receipt Inventory, EQ-5D and topic-guided interviews.
Results: Qualitative analyses showed the positive impact of BIS on patients with non-malignant conditions and
their carers; quantitative analyses showed a non-significant greater reduction in the primary outcome (‘distress due
to breathlessness’), when compared to standard care, of –0.24 (95 % CI: –1.30, 0.82). BIS resulted in extra mean costs
of £799, reducing to £100 when outliers were excluded; neither difference was statistically significant. The
quantitative findings contrasted with those previously reported for patients with cancer and their carers, which
showed BIS to be both clinically and cost effective. For patients with non-malignant conditions there was a notable
trend of improvement over both trial arms to the key measurement point; participants may have experienced a
therapeutic effect from the research interviews, diluting the intervention’s impact.

Conclusions: BIS had a statistically non-significant effect for patients with non-malignant conditions, and slightly
increased service costs, but had a qualitatively positive impact consistent with findings for advanced cancer. Trials
of palliative care interventions should consider multiple, mixed method, primary outcomes and ensure that
protocols limit potential contaminating therapeutic effects in study designs.

Background
Breathlessness is a disabling and distressing symptom of
advanced non-malignant disease that severely reduces
the quality of life of patients and their families [1, 2]. De-
fined as “a subjective experience of breathing discomfort
that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary
in intensity” [3], it is the main symptom of advanced
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but is
also the common denominator in many other advanced
non-malignant respiratory, cardiac and neuromuscular
conditions. In approximately two-thirds of patients pre-
senting with breathlessness the underlying cause is car-
diopulmonary disease [4]. Uncontrolled breathlessness
can be terrifying for patients and their families: achiev-
ing symptom control is therefore a priority [5]. In many
instances addressing breathlessness from a symptomatic
point of view is the only therapeutic option when it per-
sists in spite of optimised medical management of the
underlying condition. However, access to palliative care
is
known
to
be
poor
for
patients
with
advanced
non-malignant conditions compared to those with cancer
[6–10], despite their well-established need [11, 12].
The Cambridge Breathlessness Intervention Service
(BIS) is a multi-disciplinary complex intervention combin-
ing non-pharmacological and pharmacological interven-
tions to support breathless patients with any advanced
disease in managing their symptom, theoretically under-
pinned by a palliative care approach [13–15]. Developed
and evaluated [16–21] using the Medical Research Coun-
cil (MRC) framework for complex interventions [22], it
has undergone a Phase III RCT with two sub-protocols:
one for advanced cancer and one for advanced non-
malignant disease (due to differing service models) [23].
The findings of the sub-protocol for patients with ad-
vanced cancer have been published previously [21]; this
paper reports the findings of the contemporaneously con-
ducted sub-protocol for patients with advanced non-
malignant disease.
Methods
A detailed study protocol, including descriptions of both
the intervention and standard care, has been published
in an earlier issue of this journal [23]. Subsequent to this
the intervention has been more fully described elsewhere
[13]. Key aspects of study design, sampling, outcome
measures, data collection and analysis for the sub-
protocol for patients with advanced non-malignant dis-
ease are outlined below. A completed CONSORT 2010
Checklist is provided in Additional file 1.
Study design
We recruited patients with advanced non-malignant disease
referred to BIS into a Phase III mixed method single-blind
pragmatic fast-track RCT of BIS versus standard care (July
2008–June 2010). Participants were randomised to one of
two groups using randomly permuted blocks of random
size 2, 4 and 6, generated by the study statistician and con-
cealed within sealed opaque envelopes until allocation noti-

intervention
deliverer:
the
fast-track
(intervention) group received BIS immediately whereas the
waiting-list (control) group received BIS after four weeks.
All participants continued receiving standard, including
palliative, care.
Participants
Consecutive patients with non-malignant disease who
were referred to BIS were invited to participate in the
trial, by letter. Patients were eligible if they met BIS re-
ferral criteria (they had a diagnosed appropriately treated
cause of breathlessness, were troubled by breathlessness
in spite of optimisation of underlying illness, and might
benefit from a self-management programme) and ex-
cluded (from the trial only) if they had received BIS pre-
viously. Recruited patients were asked to identify who
gave them the most help and support at home (family
member or friend); these informal carers were also in-
vited to participate.
Ethics, consent and permissions
Ethical approval was given by Cambridgeshire2 NHS
REC (Ref: 08/H0308/157). All participating patients and
carers gave informed consent.
Participant-reported data and sample size
Patient ‘distress due to breathlessness’ (the primary out-
come on which the trial was powered) was measured
Farquhar et al. Trials  (2016) 17:185 
Page 2 of 16

using a numeric rating scale (NRS). A sample size of 60
randomised patients (26 analysed per arm, with allow-
ance for dropout) would provide 80 % power to de-
tect a 2-point difference in mean distress between
groups (SD = 2.5, alpha = 5 %), with increased precision
anticipated from adjustment for baseline. Other key
patient-reported measures included the Chronic Respira-
tory Questionnaire (CRQ) [24] and the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale (HADS) [25]. Key carer-reported
outcome measures included an NRS for carer distress due
to patient breathlessness and the HADS. The EQ-5D [26]
and Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) [27] were ad-
ministered for the health economic analyses. Brief qualita-
tive topic-guided interviews were also conducted with all
patients and carers to explore their expectations and expe-
riences of BIS. A full list of baseline measures and out-
comes is reported in the published protocol [23].
Data collection
Participating patients completed a baseline interview (t1)
prior to randomisation. This mixed method interview in-
cluded both the quantitative patient-reported measures
and the brief qualitative topic-guided interview described
above. Carers were interviewed separately where pos-
sible, using a mixed method interview of quantitative
carer-reported measures and a brief qualitative topic-
guided interview. Similar mixed method follow-up inter-
views were conducted with both patients and carers at
each subsequent follow-up interview (t2–t5) at fort-
nightly intervals. Interview two (t2; two weeks after
baseline) was designed to represent the midway point in
either receiving the BIS intervention for the intervention
arm or the waiting-list period for the controls; interview
three (t3) was designed to represent completion of BIS
for the intervention arm, or the end of the waiting-list
period prior to commencing BIS for the controls; inter-
view four (t4) was designed to represent the midway
point in receiving the BIS intervention for the controls
(no t4 was conducted with patients and carers on the
intervention arm); and the final interview (t5; eight
weeks from baseline) was designed to represent four
weeks after BIS for the intervention arm, and the com-
pletion of BIS for the controls. Data collection was
designed to facilitate researcher blinding to group allo-
cation for the collection of primary and key secondary
outcomes at t3. That is, researcher blinding was ex-
plained to study participants on recruitment, they were
reminded at the start of t2 not to let the researcher
know their group allocation, and at the start of t3 they
were asked not to let the researcher know their group al-
location until the researcher came to open their group
allocation envelope just prior to CSRI completion (after
the collection of primary and key secondary outcomes
at t3). Both clinical and administrative staff were also
reminded of the importance of researcher blinding
throughout the study.
Analysis
Intention-to-treat analyses, within completers, were con-
ducted using a linear regression model; each outcome was
adjusted for its baseline. Costs were calculated by combin-
ing service use data (collected for the two months prior to
baseline and at four-week follow-up) with UK 2011/12
unit costs [28]. The cost of the intervention was calculated
at £91 per contact based on specialist nursing input costs,
with phone contacts costed at 25 % of this. Costs were
combined with the primary outcome and EQ-5D-derived
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with uncertainty ex-
plored using cost-effectiveness planes.
Qualitative interview data were transcribed and anon-
ymised. As first described in our paper reporting the re-
sults of the sub-protocol for patients with cancer [21],
two approaches were taken to the analysis of this un-
usually comprehensive qualitative dataset. First, tran-
scripts of t3 interviews from all patients and carers were
categorised into one of three intervention impact levels
by
three
analysts
working
independently
(Level
1:
Significant impact - clearly stated BIS made a difference;
Level 2: Some impact - no major change recognised, but
valued specific aspects of BIS; Level 3: No impact – BIS
made no difference at all). Categorisation commenced
with a small number of interviews. The three analysts
then met to compare their categorisations, discussing
and resolving differences through clarifying both level
definitions and data interpretation, before repeating this
process for all remaining interviews with patients with
non-malignant disease and their carers.
Second, as qualitative analysis of this size of dataset
would be unmanageable, 20 patient (and associated
carer) intervention arm transcripts were purposefully
sampled against a four-cell matrix of t3 changes in
the primary outcome, to achieve a maximum diversity
sample [29]. The four cells represented: (Cell 1) pa-
tients who improved most on the primary outcome
(who, predictably, had high baseline scores; the Big-
gest Improvers); (Cell 2) patients with high baseline
scores (to match Cell 1) but who improved least
(Limited Improvers); (Cell 3) patients who worsened
(who transpired to have low-middling baseline scores;
Worseners);
and
(Cell
4)
patients
with
closest
matches to Cell 3 baseline scores but who improved
most (Moderate Improvers). Anonymised interview
transcripts for this purposive sample were imported
into NVivo software [30] to facilitate framework ana-
lysis [31]. This analysis explored patient and carer re-
ports of the nature of the impact of BIS and which
aspects of BIS were valued, and sought to identify
possible mechanisms of impact.

Results
Recruitment and baseline characteristics
Figure 1 (CONSORT flow diagram) indicates that we
randomised 87 patients and 79 (91 %) completed the
trial to the key outcome measurement (t3). Eight pa-
tients withdrew from the trial prior to t3: three and five
from the intervention and control arms respectively
(including one death in each arm). Researchers remained
blinded to group allocation for 67 % (53/79) of patients
for collection of the t3 primary outcome.
Baseline characteristics were well matched across trial
arms (Tables 1 and 2). Patients were predominantly elderly,
male and living with others. COPD was the commonest
non-malignant disease (predominantly GOLD stage 3 or 4;
severe to very severe). Their mean HADS anxiety score was
slightly higher than population norms and their mean
HADS depression score notably higher (mean population
norm for anxiety 6.14 (SD = 3.76) and depression 3.68
(SD = 3.07) [32]). Just over half (n = 46, 53 %) had anxiety
scores that were clinically meaningful (clinically meaning-
ful threshold of 7) and just under half (n = 39; 45 %) had
clinically meaningful depression scores. Breathlessness,
performance status and co-morbidity were as anticipated
for these patients. Patient ‘distress due to breathlessness’
and CRQ domain scores were similar across trial arms.
Carers were predominantly older women, and about
half were in employment. As with the patients their
mean HADS anxiety and depression scores were higher
than population norms [32]. Anxiety scores were clinic-
ally meaningful for just over half of the carers (n = 25,
52 %) and just under a quarter (n = 10, 21 %) had clinic-
ally meaningful depression scores. Carer ‘distress due to
patient breathlessness’ was lower than patient distress,
but similar across trial arms.

from baseline (t1) to the key outcome measurement
point (t3) showed that patients randomised to the inter-
vention arm achieved a greater, 2.22-point, reduction in
their distress due to breathlessness compared with a
1.56-point reduction for controls; however, this was not
statistically
significant:
adjusted
difference
of
–0.24
(95 % CI: –1.30 to 0.82), p = 0.65 (Table 3). Carers of pa-
tients randomised to the intervention arm achieved a
greater, 1.03-point, reduction in their distress due to
their patient’s breathlessness compared with a 0.2-point
increase for controls, but again this was not statistically
significant: adjusted difference of –0.42 (95 % CI: –1.86
to 1.02), p = 0.56 (Table 4).
Change in patient mastery of breathlessness, and patient
and carer anxiety and depression
Mean CRQ mastery scores improved slightly by t3 on
both arms with greater improvement in the intervention

arm; not statistically significant (Table 3). No significant
differences were found between trial arms to t3 on other
CRQ domains (dyspnoea, fatigue or emotional function).
Mean patient anxiety scores decreased slightly for the
intervention arm and increased slightly for the control
arm by t3 and mean depression scores decreased slightly
by t3 in the intervention arm and remained stable for
controls; none of these modest changes was statistically
significant (Table 3). Mean anxiety scores for carers
achieved a greater, 1.65-point, reduction by t3 in the
intervention arm compared with a 0.15-point reduction
for controls, but again this was not statistically signifi-
cant: adjusted difference of –1.22 (95 % CI: –2.84 to
0.40), p = 0.14 (Table 4). There was little change in other
patient or carer secondary outcomes.
Reported benefit of BIS
Categorisation of qualitative interviews (n = 78; no quali-
tative interview for one patient) indicated that 56 % (n =
44) of patients, or patient-carer dyads, inferred that BIS
had had a significant impact (Level 1). A further 36 %
(n = 28) suggested BIS had had some impact (that is, no
major change noted, but they valued specific aspects
of BIS; Level 2) and 8 % (n = 6) reported no impact
(Level 3) (Table 5).
Table 6 shows the Impact Categorisation Levels for the
purposively sampled qualitative interviews (sampled for
maximum diversity of change on primary outcome to t3).
As in the sub-protocol for patients with cancer, given the
skewed distribution of the Impact Categorisation Levels it
is unsurprising that most were Levels 1 and 2, even among
‘Worseners’ on the primary outcome (Cell 3).
Qualitative analysis of the purposively sampled inter-
views identified the nature of the impacts of BIS and
which aspects of the BIS model were valued, and also
sought to identify possible mechanisms of impact. The
findings of these qualitative analyses for patients with
non-malignant conditions and their carers reaffirmed
the findings for patients with cancer and their carers re-
ported previously [21]. Patients with non-malignant con-
ditions and their carers described a range of impacts
including reduced fear, anxiety, worry, and feelings of
panic (“with the breathlessness I wasn’t scared […] I did
a lot [of activity] yesterday and still I wasn’t panicked or
distressed” [158t3p]), as well as feeling more confident
about breathlessness. They valued the multi-disciplinary
staff expertise (their knowledge and understanding of life
with breathlessness), the characteristics of the BIS staff
(their approachability and attentiveness) and their re-
assuring and positive approach, and the time BIS gave

them to talk about breathlessness with an expert (“This
was somebody who knew what we were talking about,
talked the same language” [042t3p]). Like the patients
with cancer [21], they again reported that being seen at
home was especially helpful.
Patients with non-malignant conditions and their
carers identified the same BIS-delivered interventions
they found therapeutic as reported previously for pa-
tients with cancer and their carers [21]. These included:
providing a handheld fan and teaching patients how to

use it; encouragement of exercise and goal-setting;
coaching in breathing techniques, positioning, pacing
and relaxation; providing occupational therapy aids; in-
formation and education — again, as reported for pa-
tients with cancer [21], learning that “being breathless
won’t kill me” was particularly important to some pa-
tients and carers. Again patients with non-malignant
conditions reported the benefits of advice on daily strat-
egies to ease breathlessness, and again many referred to
these as “lots of little tips”, but patients with non-
malignant conditions and their carers particularly valued
how the service reviewed their established practices and
strategies, praised effective approaches, and provided re-
assurance. As with the patients with cancer [21], our ex-
planatory analysis suggests that it was not only the
provision of these interventions that was important, but
also that how they were delivered was key to their impact:
delivery of interventions through the provision of know-
ledge (why and how interventions work or specific guid-
ance on how and when to use a particular intervention)
increased patients’ and carers’ confidence and legitimised
strategies that at first appeared too simple to be effective
or to have much impact. Thus, as for patients with cancer
and their carers, the mechanism of impact of BIS appears
to relate to the acknowledgement and validation of breath-
lessness, and improved knowledge about breathlessness,
which enhances patients’ and carers’ understanding and
their confidence in living with the symptom, reducing feel-
ings of being alone with breathlessness. Table 7 provides
illustrative quotes for the gaining of knowledge and confi-
dence, and some participant-identified interventions for
patients with non-malignant conditions and their carers.
As with patients with cancer [21], reviewing tran-
scripts for the categorisation of impact levels exercise
identified BIS contacts beyond the key measurement
point for the primary outcome for a substantial propor-
tion of patients with non-malignant conditions: 39 % of
patients (30/78) described planned BIS contacts beyond
t3. Thus, as was noted for with patients with cancer
[21], there may have been further benefit beyond the pri-
mary outcome at t3.
In addition, this review of transcripts identified the
potential therapeutic effect of the research interviews
on patients with non-malignant conditions and their
carers as well as the difficulty some had in separating
their researcher from the intervention. Nearly a quarter
of patients with non-malignant conditions and/or their
carers explicitly stated that talking to their researcher
about breathlessness was helpful: 23 % (18/78) com-
pared with 18 % of patients with cancer and their
carers (10/54). Just over a quarter had difficulty separ-
ating their researcher from the intervention: 26 % (20/
78) compared with 15 % of patients with cancer and
their carers (8/54). Table 8 provides illustrative quotes
for the potential therapeutic effect of the research in-
terviews on patients with non-malignant conditions
and their carers.

Costs and cost effectiveness
In the two months prior to baseline the waiting-list
group was more likely to have had inpatient care, and
this resulted in a difference in total costs of £1,678
(Table 9). Other service use at baseline was similar be-
tween the two groups. The difference in inpatient costs
was in the opposite direction during the follow-up
period and total costs were £712 higher for the fast-
track group (Table 10). The difference after adjusting for
baseline was £799, and this was not statistically signifi-
cant (95 % CI, -£237 to £1904). Two of the six cases
with inpatient stays in the fast-track group had stays
substantially greater than for other admitted patients
across both trial arms (n = 4 other admitted patients in
each arm); further investigation of these two admissions
defined them as unrelated to BIS. Excluding these two
cases results in costs remaining higher in the fast-track
group by £100.
Table 7 Illustrative quotes about mechanisms of impact and
valued interventions from purposive sample of patients with
non-malignant conditions
Mechanisms of impact
Mechanism of impact - gaining knowledge:
Patient: “Well I’ve gone back to my choir last Friday, first time in
6 months … and it was fantastic, I was so happy to be there, yeah,
really pleased to be there. Couldn’t do the singing as much as I would
like to, but it’s coming, it’s coming. And it was lovely because everybody
was pleased to see me and lots of hugs and kisses, so … it was really
nice […] I think it is the Breathlessness Service has done it […] talking it
over with experts, having people come to the house giving me pointers
of how I can improve my daily living”
[137t3p; Impact Categorisation Level 1 – Significant impact; Cell 1 – Biggest
Improvers on primary outcome]
Mechanism of impact - feeling not alone:
Carer: “the fact that there are things out there […] it is the reassurance
and support really […] we have felt we’ve had support from everybody,
and I’m always telling people […] what marvellous support we’ve had,
and it does make a difference. You know the outcome’s not going to
be really any different, but it does make a difference to have that
support, definitely”
[012t3pc; Impact Categorisation Level 1 – Significant impact; Cell 1 – Biggest
Improvers on primary outcome]
Mechanism of impact - gaining confidence:
Patient: “the next thing she said is cool air, you know, plenty of air, and
gave me that fan, and that when you are sort of out of breath […] use
that for about 10 minutes, and she showed me how to breathe in and
went not ‘ha’ (harsh) like that but ‘ha’ (soft) like that, you know, and she
explained all that to me, and then the next thing she said is relaxing,
not tensed up, and how I should position myself, sitting, lying down,
and so on, you know, everything that … even standing, how I should
do it, and she gave me the notes on it […] it gave me a lot of
confidence with myself, which I didn’t have before, with this breathing
[…] it gave me a lot of confidence in the sense that I’m more relaxed
about breathing, and even smoke less”
[158t3p; Impact Categorisation Level 1 – Significant impact; Cell 3 – Worsener
on primary outcome]
Valued interventions
Valued intervention - handheld fan:
Patient: “She said this [fan] might help instead of the oxygen. […] When
I’m just a little bit out of breath or first thing in the morning… when
I’m coughing and spluttering I start getting short of breath, I can lay in
bed and use that, so I don’t have oxygen upstairs. […] I take it to work
[and] I can get out of the lorry more […] because I know […] I’ll put my
hand in my pocket, turn it on as I’m walking back to my cab (puts fan
on) and by the time I get to the cab I’m OK. Before I had it I used to
have to stand at the lorry door and catch my breath […] when I’ve got
a chest infection, like now, I get to the back of the lorry [and] the
weather’s wrong or I grab a bin wrong… ‘phew’ [but] I can put this on,
walk back to the cab. Whereas before I had this like… if I had a chest
infection I’d stay on my arse all day”
[126t3p; Impact Categorisation Level 1 – Significant impact; Cell 3 – Worsener
on primary outcome]
Valued intervention - positioning:
Patient: “well it was her who told me about my shoulders, which was
very helpful I thought […] you get a pillow under each one […] and
you relax your shoulders […] I found that very helpful actually, you
know, I think ‘well, I’ve got to do my shoulders’ […] That’s entirely new
to me that was. I’m surprised the exercise places I’ve been [didn’t
mention] the shoulders. Amazing that is, absolutely amazing […] She
said it puts a lot of strain on your shoulders by keeping them up all the
time, you know, and she said do that […] and she showed me about
the pillows, and […] that makes a difference”

Improver on primary outcome]
Table 7 Illustrative quotes about mechanisms of impact and
valued interventions from purposive sample of patients with
non-malignant conditions (Continued)
Valued intervention – “breathlessness won’t kill you”:
Carer: “when he’s breathless he panics naturally because he’s always felt
that […] he was going to die, but [the BIS doctor] said ‘that will not
happen, not in one of your breathless attacks, you will not die in an
attack’, which helped me because you know, I then have to think ‘oh
my gosh, what can I do to help him’…you know. So she did give me
some leaders as to what I can do to help, knowing now that he won’t
die in one of these sort of situations, so that certainly helped me, and it
certainly helped me to realise that, you know, I can probably help him
to calm down. So yes, as a carer I think it was a help.”

Table 8 Illustrative quotes on the potential therapeutic effect of
research interviews for patients with non-malignant conditions
and their carers
Interviewer: “[…] what did you find helpful?”
Carer: “I think being able to talk to somebody other than… a total
stranger shall we say… and like yourself, I mean I feel as if I’ve known
you for years, it’s strange […] you know, you feel like part and parcel of
the family”
[Carer 108t3c]
Patient: “[being] able to talk to somebody who understands. Because,
with the best will in the world, people who don’t have breathing
problems don’t understand what it’s like not to be able to breathe. All
of them, my family, friends, everybody, because you all do it
automatically, you don’t have to think about it, they’ve got no idea
what it’s like, but talking to people who do understand like yourself, like
[BIS team member], like the doctors, is helpful […] talking it over […]
because you and [BIS team member] are approachable […] I feel as
though I could talk to you, and I felt I could talk to her, I didn’t feel
intimidated”
[Patient 137t3p]
Patient: “being able to talk to different people, yourself included, you
realise that you can cope, and if you do what you’re told sort of thing…
I suppose like a child! […] I’m glad that I’ve spoken to you, yourselves,
and other people, and I don’t find any fault with any of you at all”

The EQ-5D utility scores for the fast-track group were
0.49, 0.58 and 0.59 at baseline, two-week follow-up and
four-week follow-up respectively. The figures for the
waiting-list group were 0.55, 0.58 and 0.54. The max-
imum QALY gain over the four-week follow-up period
was 0.077. The QALY gain for the fast-track group was
0.0431, while for the waiting-list group it was 0.0430, in-
dicating virtually no difference. This was mainly due to
the lower baseline utility score (which is used in the
QALY calculations) for the fast-track group. After con-
trolling for baseline EQ-5D scores, it was shown that the
fast-track group gained 0.003 extra QALYs (95 % CI, –
0.001 to 0.007). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio
indicated that intervention resulted in a cost per QALY
of £266,333, which is substantially above the threshold
used by NICE (£20,000–£30,000). If the cost difference
of £100 (excluding the intervention patients with ex-
treme inpatient costs) is used, the cost per QALY is
much less at £33,333 but still above the threshold. The
cost-effectiveness plane revealed that there was an
86.5 % likelihood that the intervention had higher costs
and resulted in more QALYs. There was only around a
7 % likelihood of lower costs and more QALYs. How-
ever, when the two outliers were removed, there was a
54.7 % likelihood of higher costs and more QALYs and a
33.9 % likelihood of lower costs and more QALYs.
Discussion
In this Phase III RCT of BIS for patients with non-
malignant conditions there was the same positive direc-
tion of quantitative effect as reported previously for
patients with cancer, but the effect was smaller and was
not statistically significant; for those with cancer the ser-
vice had a reasonably sized and statistically significant
clinical effect [21]. The health economic findings showed
that the intervention increased costs slightly; the costs
per QALY were above the thresholds used by NICE. A
remarkably similar proportion of patients with non-
malignant disease and their carers reported qualitatively
that BIS had made a positive difference: 92 % of patients
with non-malignant disease and their carers compared
with 94 % of those with cancer [21]. For patients with

non-malignant disease and their carers, these impacts,
the identifiable interventions they found helpful, and the
mechanisms of impact were the same as those identified
by patients with cancer and their carers. In addition, pa-
tients with non-malignant conditions and their carers
particularly valued praise of their established strategies
and the provision of reassurance, potentially reflecting
the longevity of their experience of breathlessness. Thus
the result of the analysis of qualitative data from the two
sub-protocols was strikingly similar: BIS had made a
positive impact for the majority of patients and carers
living with breathlessness. Another service using similar
complex, predominantly non-pharmacological, interven-
tions has reported a clinically and cost-effective impact
in this group [33].
We have considered three areas for discussion which
may illuminate reasons for the differences in our main
findings between the two disease groups: (1) baseline
differences between those living with non-malignant
conditions compared to those with cancer; (2) the not-
able trend of improvement over both trial arms for pa-
tients
with
non-malignant
conditions
to
the
key
measurement point; and (3) exploration of the difference
in magnitude of the quantitative and qualitative results
in this mixed method trial.
Baseline differences between non-malignant conditions
and cancer
There were noteworthy clinical differences at baseline
between both patients and carers on the sub-protocol
for non-malignant conditions (Tables 1 and 2) and the
sub-protocol for cancer (equivalent Table 1 in Farquhar
et al., 2014 [21]). Although the mean Charlson Co-
Morbidity Index was worse (higher) for patients with
cancer, the mean Australia-modified Karnofsky Perform-
ance Scale score was worse (lower) for patients with
non-malignant disease. Similarly mean modified Borg
scales and NRS scores for breathlessness, CRQ scores,
and both patient and carer HADS scores for anxiety and
depression were consistently worse (higher) for those liv-
ing with non-malignant disease. Importantly, it is worth
noting that initial ‘distress due to breathlessness’ (pri-
mary outcome measure) was also higher for patients
with non-malignant disease and their carers.
Brief reports of work by Chowienczyk et al. [34] and
Javadzadeh et al. [35], comparing patients with advanced
COPD recruited on the protocol for non-malignant con-
ditions to those recruited on the protocol for cancer,
identified statistical and clinical differences between
these two disease groups in terms of their Descriptors of
Breathlessness and CRQ scores, suggesting that the
groups were different in terms of both their experience
of, and impact of, breathlessness. Different combinations of
clusters of Descriptors of Breathlessness were associated
with each diagnostic group; the cluster ‘chest tightness’ was
associated with cancer patients [34]. Patients with advanced
COPD scored lower across all four CRQ domains than pa-
tients with advanced cancer; this was statistically significant
for the dyspnoea, mastery, and emotional functioning
scores (p < 0.05), and clinically significant for the latter two,
suggesting poorer respiratory health-related quality of life
and a potential difference in referral threshold with a higher
threshold for non-malignant disease [35].
Trend of improvement across trial arms
There was a notable trend of improvement over both
trial arms for patients with non-malignant conditions to
the key measurement point; that is, there was a clinically
significant 1.56-reduction for the control arm by t3
(Table 3). This contrasts with the findings for patients
with cancer, who showed very little change by t3 for the
control arm on the primary outcome (0.23-reduction)
(equivalent Table 2 in Farquhar et al., 2014 [21]). Three
potential explanations for this improvement in patients
with non-malignant conditions whilst they were in the
control condition include regression to the mean, a refer-
ral effect, or a therapeutic effect from the research in-
terviews. Regression to the mean is a well-established
phenomenon, but less has been written about potential re-
ferral effects or therapeutic effects of research interviews.
Considering a potential referral effect, our pre-clinical
findings had previously highlighted the isolation experi-
enced by patients with breathlessness and the valued but
sporadic nature of existing service contacts [16]. Simi-
larly, Gysels and Higginson have described the “invisibil-
ity of breathlessness” in COPD and the impact of this on
service access [12]. The fact that a referral to a specialist
service such as BIS had occurred could have affected our
measured outcomes if this diagnostic group of patients
and carers had a sense of anticipation of expert help.
The potential therapeutic effect of research interviews
is also worth considering. Similar in effect to measure-
ment reactivity [36] or assessment reactivity [37] (in that
this would be an unintended consequence of the data
collection process), a therapeutic effect could arise from
research interviews where qualitative interviewing tech-
niques provide study participants with the opportunity
and time to tell their story, and in response the inter-
viewer actively listens and responds with empathy and
understanding. There are neurophysiological explana-
tions for why empathy is helpful in the management of
breathlessness [38]. This therapeutic effect was a recur-
ring theme in our qualitative data from patients with
non-malignant conditions and their carers, some of
whom explicitly stated that talking to their researcher
was helpful. A component of the BIS model, and a
palliative care approach, is actively listening to patients
and carers. Indeed one of the many aspects of the
Farquhar et al. Trials  (2016) 17:185 
Page 11 of 16

intervention valued by patients was the opportunity to
talk about breathlessness to someone who actively lis-
tened, and another was having their breathlessness vali-
dated or legitimised — our research interviews did both.
It is also worth noting
that all five researchers across
the two sub-protocols came from either a health or
psychology background (three from nursing, one from
psychology, and one from physiotherapy).
There is a small but growing literature within palliative
and end of life care research of the non-harmful, and
even positive, effects of research interviews on study par-
ticipants (for example, [39–41]); however, this literature
usually informs debates on the ethics of palliative and
end of life care research and relates predominantly to
qualitative observational studies. Here we suggest that,
whilst qualitative interviews may indeed have a positive
impact on study participants, positive impact may actu-
ally have a contaminating effect on quantitative research
outcomes, diluting any measurable impact of interven-
tions. This is problematic for the design of mixed
method randomised studies of interventions with sup-
portive or psychological components and has been noted
by others [42]. The collection of baseline data through
postal, rather than face-to-face or verbal methods, may
have reduced this effect but at the cost of not obtaining
qualitative baseline data and at the risk of greater loss to
follow-up.
The more frequently verbalised therapeutic effect of the
research interviews in the sub-protocol for patients with
non-malignant conditions may relate to the fact that this
sub-protocol included more researcher contacts than the
sub-protocol for patients with cancer. It may also relate to
a greater need for a therapeutic alliance [43, 44] in pa-
tients with non-malignant conditions and their carers, or
the greater investment in psychological support for
patients with cancer as part of supportive care, such as
Macmillan Cancer Support and Maggie’s Centres. Patients
experiencing breathlessness in non-malignant conditions
have usually lived with their condition for much longer
than those with cancer. Their trajectory of declining func-
tioning and increasing breathlessness is less steep [45, 46],
and so they may develop their own practical strategies to
enable life with breathlessness. Thus it may be that BIS is
still effective for patients with non-malignant conditions
but in a different way than for those with cancer. In can-
cer, where the illness experience in the breathless patient
is usually shorter in duration, the slope of decline in func-
tioning and increasing breathlessness is potentially steeper,
meaning they have had less time to self-develop strategies
to enable life with breathlessness: thus BIS has to teach
these. The reassuring role of BIS was certainly more pre-
dominant for patients with non-malignant conditions and
their carers. As one of the BIS providers said: “the needs
felt different, but the malignant patients had a lot of acute
anxiety about what breathlessness was and what it meant,
and how it would be in the future because the worsening of
their condition was coming quite quickly to them and their
condition was going to worsen […] relatively soon, whereas
with the non-malignant patients […] didn’t have those
acute anxieties, and it was something they’d lived with for
a while, and […] they wanted to know more about perhaps
exercising, keeping going and being able to do the things
they loved and that slow change and the coming to terms
with that slow change, whereas the malignant patients it
was all about the very acute anxiety and distress of dealing
with this condition that was changing quite rapidly” [BIS
Provider 02].
Differences in the quantitative and qualitative data
There was a difference in magnitude between the quan-
titative and qualitative findings of this mixed method
trial, with a more positive outcome from the qualitative
data. This held true across both sub-protocols, but was
more notable in the non-malignant disease sub-protocol.
Wagner et al. state that the “challenges inherent in rec-
onciling apparently conflicting findings from qualitative
and quantitative approaches […] has the potential to yield
benefits that emerge only through the struggle to recon-
cile discrepant results and may provide a sum that is
greater than the individual qualitative and quantitative
parts” [47]. Reviewing the BIS RCT mixed method find-
ings through the lens of Moffatt et al.’s six strategies for
exploring “discrepant” or “conflicting” findings facilitated
this “struggle” [48]:
i) Treat the methods as fundamentally different – The
BIS RCT quantitative and qualitative methods
shared the ultimate purpose of assessing the
effectiveness of BIS (although the qualitative
methods sought to do more than this and explore
mechanisms of action as well), but they did so in a
fundamentally different way: through different, but
related, questions and approaches. The methods,
and their findings, should therefore be considered
complementary rather than confirmatory.
ii) Explore the methodological rigour of each component –
The BIS RCT qualitative interviews were brief, but
were focused and data-rich, and were conducted with
the same sample (and across the entire sample);
however, we have described above the potentially
therapeutic effect of these interviews. Researchers were
blinded to the key measurement point for the
quantitative primary outcome, and study-specific
training and monitoring (all data collection, quantitative
and qualitative, was audio-recorded) facilitated
quantitative data collection fidelity.
iii)Explore dataset comparability – A strength of the
mixed method BIS RCT was that the two data types
Farquhar et al. Trials  (2016) 17:185 
Page 12 of 16

were collected contemporaneously, by the same
researcher (caseloads were held) and from the same
sample.
iv) Collect further data and make further comparisons –
The progressive nature of patients’ conditions in the
BIS RCT, trial design and funding limits prevented
the collection of further data, plus this was felt
unnecessary given our response to the first of the
strategies of Moffat et al.
v) Explore the process of the intervention – The possible
referral effect and the delivery of the intervention
beyond the BIS RCT protocol was such that the full
effect of the service may not have been captured at
the key measurement point, as discussed above; the
primary outcome may have been collected too soon.
vi) Explore whether the outcomes of the two components
match – As noted above, the quantitative and
qualitative components of the BIS RCT addressed
different, but related, questions; thus we would not
anticipate, or desire, a perfect match. There was
some congruence between the qualitative data and
the outcome measure for mastery (a CRQ domain),
but the qualitative data revealed some specific
concepts not measured by the primary or secondary
outcomes, such as confidence and knowledge.
Consideration should be given as to whether the
’right’ primary outcome and/or outcome measure
was used for the trial, and for the non-malignant
sub-protocol in particular, and this is discussed in
more detail below.
Our use of the same primary outcome measure for both
sub-protocols may have been flawed given the differences
between the two groups outlined earlier; however, our
paper reporting on the sub-protocol for cancer also ques-
tioned the appropriateness of this primary outcome given
that some patients who deteriorated on the primary out-
come measure also qualitatively reported benefits from
BIS [21] (a finding repeated in the sub-protocol for non-
malignant conditions). The findings of the unpowered
Phase II pilot trial showed the same positive trend for the
same primary outcome for patients with COPD, and thus
did not suggest it was inappropriate [19].
Interestingly, Moffat et al. considered that, in retro-
spect, a more relevant outcome for their own study
would have been ’ability to cope’ — this is an outcome
that, with hindsight, might have been more relevant for
BIS too. Our paper reporting on the sub-protocol for
cancer noted that BIS may have increased coping cap-
acity [21]. Not only are ’coping’ and ’distress’ different
conceptually, but ’coping’ can have both positive and
negative connotations, whereas ’distress’ is entirely nega-
tive; similarly, ’ability to live with/manage breathlessness’
or ’feeling equipped to live with/manage breathlessness’
can be positive or negative. Another alternative would
be an outcome based on ’gains’, which is entirely positive
(and is meaningful to the NHS).
Consideration should be given to using multiple pri-
mary outcomes. Complex interventions have multiple
components which are likely to have multiple (positive
and negative) effects; it may be misleading, or naïve, to
have one primary outcome measure. To get the true im-
pact of a complex intervention we need to move, as pro-
posed by Carr-Hill nearly 25 years ago, beyond the
primary outcome measure: “It has long been recognised
that outcomes of treatment are multidimensional and
complex, and that, to varying degrees, any single index
measure of outcome will be inadequate to capture im-
portant differences” [49].
BIS is a palliative care service, and there may be different
margins of benefit, and a greater spread of benefits, in pal-
liative care complex interventions, with a cumulative effect
from the addition of several smaller (quantitative) outcome
benefits. It may simply be unrealistic to expect one pri-
mary outcome measure to capture it all. An editorial by
Richards skillfully applies the “amalgamation of marginal
gains” concept first described by Sir Dave Brailsford, team
manager of Team GB’s highly successful cycling team [50],
to health care [51]. Brailsford’s approach sought marginal
gains from single components of the team’s training in
order to improve overall performance; as applied by
Richards, these gains relate to ’simple’ nursing interven-
tions which individually make only a marginal difference,
but in total reduce discomfort and anxiety. As described
earlier, patients and carers reported that BIS helpfully
provided ’lots of little tips’. There is also the inherent
challenge in palliative and end of life care outcome
measurement that we expect deterioration [52].
Consideration should also be given to using mixed
method primary outcomes. Normand has noted that
“faced with the complex and multidimensional objectives
of
palliative
care,
analysis
of
outcomes
and
cost-
effectiveness needs to embrace the complexity, and […]
draw on a range of evidence, complex measurement
tools, and a good understanding of context” [53]. As
Cawley et al. suggest, qualitatively capturing patients’ ac-
tual experience of palliative care is a more accurate
measure of how and what patients judge as important in
their healthcare, but note the challenge lies in “how we
convert the very positive experience of individuals into a
language of outcome measures” [54]. In the field of
breathlessness, Rocker has asked how we can capture
those aspects of breathlessness that really matter to pa-
tients and their families and asks whether a numeric rat-
ing scale change in response to a therapeutic intervention
is sufficient, “or does it tell only part of the story?” [55].
Thus our qualitative data (which was rich, consistent and
complete) may simply have encompassed more, been
Farquhar et al. Trials  (2016) 17:185 
Page 13 of 16

more global, capturing several outcomes resulting from
several component interventions delivered by BIS, which
may explain the difference in magnitude between the
quantitative and qualitative datasets.
If both the quantitative and qualitative findings of the
sub-protocol for patients with non-malignant conditions
had indicated there was no impact from BIS, or a nega-
tive impact, then this might have suggested that: refer-
rals
to
BIS
for
patients
with
cancer
were
more
appropriate; that BIS delivered different interventions to
the different disease groups (due to different needs) and
that these were more or less effective in the different
disease groups; that differences in the service model by
disease group had an impact (such as the duration of
BIS); or that BIS was simply more effective for patients
with cancer. However, the difference in the findings be-
tween the two disease groups was only in the quantita-
tive data, thus the data, and the arguments considered
earlier in this discussion, suggest: a greater therapeutic
effect of the research interviews on patients with non-
malignant disease (due either to their previously unmet
needs, or a dose response to their additional interview);
that the primary outcome was more appropriate for pa-
tients with cancer either due to the longer term unrelent-
ing nature of breathlessness in non-malignant disease such
that distress remains high, or that BIS delivered different
(but still important) interventions to patients with non-
malignant disease (due to different needs) that didn’t
impact on distress; or that our reliance on a single quanti-
tative primary outcome measure is misguided and we
should seek ways to compute multiple outcomes relating
to components of complex interventions whilst also pla-
cing greater emphasis on qualitative outcomes. A combin-
ation of these explanations seems likely given accumulating
knowledge suggesting the benefits of BIS-type models of
care for breathlessness in advanced malignant and non-
malignant disease [21, 33, 56].
Conclusions
In conclusion, BIS has a positive qualitatively identified
impact on patients with non-malignant conditions and
their carers, and there was the same positive direction of
quantitative effect as reported previously for patients with
cancer, but the effect was smaller and was not statistically
significant when compared to standard care using the
quantitative primary outcome of patient distress due to
breathlessness. BIS resulted in slightly increased service
costs for patients with non-malignant conditions; to see if
BIS is cost effective would require a longer follow-up.
There were important differences between participants on
the sub-protocol for non-malignant conditions and that
for cancer in terms of their baseline characteristics and
the notable trend of improvement over both trial
arms for patients with non-malignant conditions to
the key measurement point; they may also have experi-
enced a greater therapeutic effect from the research inter-
views which diluted the impact of the intervention. Trials
of palliative care complex interventions should consider
using multiple, mixed method, primary outcomes and en-
sure protocols limit potential contaminating therapeutic
effects from the research design.
