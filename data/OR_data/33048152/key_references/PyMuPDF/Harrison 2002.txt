BACKGROUND. The growing number of pa-
tients with congestive heart failure has in-
creased both the pressure on hospital resources
and the need for community management of
the
condition.
Improving
hospital-to-home
transition for this population is a logical step
in responding to current practice guidelines’
recommendations for coordination and educa-
tion. Positive outcomes have been reported
from trials evaluating multiple interventions,
enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up
through the addition of a case management
role. The question remains if similar gains
could be achieved working with usual hospital
and community nurses.
METHODS. A 12-week, prospective, random-
ized controlled trial was conducted of the ef-
fect of transitional care on health-related qual-
ity
of
life
(disease-specific
and
generic
measures), rates of readmission, and emer-
gency room use. The nurse-led intervention
focused on the transition from hospital-to-
home
and
supportive
care
for
self-
management 2 weeks after hospital discharge.
RESULTS. At 6 weeks after hospital discharge,
the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Fail-
ure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better
among
the
Transitional
Care
patients
(27.2  19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care
patients (37.5  20.3 SD; P  0.002). Similar
results were found at 12 weeks postdischarge
for the overall MLHFQ and at 6- and 12-
weeks postdischarge for the MLHFQ’s Phys-
ical Dimension and Emotional Dimension
subscales. Differences in generic quality life,
as assessed by the SF-36 Physical component,
Mental Component, and General Health sub-
scales, were not significantly different be-
tween the Transition and Usual Care groups.
At 12 weeks postdischarge, 31% of the Usual
Care patients had been readmitted compared
with 23% of the Transitional Care patients
(P  0.26), and 46% of the Usual Care group
visited the emergency department compared
with 29% in the Transitional Care group
(2  4.86, df 1, P  0.03).

CONCLUSIONS. There were significant im-
provements in health-related quality of life
(HRQL) associated with Transitional Care and
less use of emergency rooms.
Key
words:
Heart
failure;
transition;
hospital-to-home. (Med Care 2002;40:271–282)
Individuals with congestive heart failure (CHF)
are one of the fastest growing and challenging
complex health populations requiring care in both
the hospital and community sectors. The incidence
of CHF increases dramatically with age, and there
is a 50% mortality after 5 years.1,2 CHF is reported
to be the only cardiovascular condition that is
increasing in incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and
mortality.2–5 Heart failure may be an even greater
public health problem than the statistics reveal.
Estimates rely on ICD codes for primary and
secondary diagnosis, and these have been re-
ported to exclude one third of patients with clinical
evidence of acute CHF.6
For individuals and families dealing with heart
failure, the condition poses significant challenges
in terms of day-to-day living and the burden of
care. Frequent hospital admissions are common.7,8
There is a fragile balance between coping with this
long-term condition at home and the exacerba-
tions, often life-threatening, which require hospi-
talization. Considering the illness trajectory of
individuals with heart failure and the therapeutic
limits of drug therapies, the effectiveness of non-
pharmaceutical, adjunctive interventions has be-
come a clinical and research priority. These inter-
ventions include enhancing self-management and
symptom control through knowledge, diet, rest
and exercise, and proactive symptom monitoring.
The former Agency for Health Care Policy and
Research (AHCPR) guidelines4 for CHF, for exam-
ple, make eight specific recommendations related
to hospital discharge and counseling, and self-
management. Professional bodies agree that effec-
tive management of this condition requires collab-
orative, proactive vigilance of medical therapies by
health care providers and active support for self-
management before and after hospitalizations.4,9
Recommendations about incorporating a compre-
hensive approach across sectors of care (hospital,
ambulatory, and home care) have followed closely
on the international efforts with clinical practice
guidelines about heart failure.9 Recent randomized
trials7,10–12 have begun to rigorously evaluate the
effectiveness of delivery models emphasizing sup-
portive care for self-management (telephone out-
reach, patient education and information), and indi-
rect care activities (coordination, case managing and
communication).
Both
hospital-based7,10,12
and
community-based approaches11,13,14 have shown
that an enhanced discharge process and follow-up,
with the addition of a clinical nurse specialist, case
manager, or cardiac nurse, produces positive patient
benefit, reduces hospital readmission and health
services utilization, or both. Characteristic themes are
innovative delivery strategies, multiple interventions
that add a component of comprehensive patient
education and counseling, proactive nurse follow-
up, and increased access to providers. However,
these studies are limited by small sample size,11
interventions requiring addition of new provid-
ers,7,10–12 and primary outcomes focusing exclusively
on system-related endpoints eg, readmission and
emergency visits.7,10–12,14 In summary, the trials are
evaluating health services designed to ‘case manage’
a population with CHF by maintaining provider
contact with patients through intensive assessment
and education techniques to prevent disease exacer-
bation.15 However, Ferguson and Weinberger15
found equivocal results in their review of case man-
agement studies about the benefits in the health care
system compared with the putative advantages.
Thus, the question remains as to what can be done
to stave off CHF exacerbations within the normal
organization of services with the usual nurse provid-
ers, who are typically generalists. Cook et al16 argue
that complex systems can have gaps between peo-
ple, stages, and processes. A key aspect for improve-
ments is through the reinforcement of a practitio-
ner’s normal ability to bridge these gaps. In the case
of heart failure, our premise was that adding a new
provider might not be the most effective, feasible, or
efficient solution. Could the gap be bridged another
way? Rather, by focusing on the activities of usual
providers, and the structure and process of transition
from hospital-to-home, could continuity with sup-
port for self-management be enhanced to improve
patient
outcomes
and
reduce
health
service
utilization?
We conducted a prospective, randomized trial
to evaluate whether the use of usual providers,
and a reorganization of discharge planning and
transition care with improved intersector linkages
between nurses, could improve quality of life and

health services utilization for individuals admitted
to hospital with heart failure. It was hypothesized
that the enhanced transition process would im-
prove quality of life and reduce emergency room
visits and hospital admissions for individuals dis-
charged from hospital with heart failure.
Materials and Methods
Study Patients and Setting
All individuals admitted to two general medical
units of a large urban teaching hospital in Ottawa,
Ontario, Canada, with a diagnosis of congestive
heart failure, were screened for the study. The two
units were similar in size (35–37 beds), occupancy
rates (90–94%) and RN staffing (49–51% full time,
29–33% permanent part-time). A centralized de-
partment admitted patients to either unit, based
solely on bed availability. Study inclusion criteria
included: residing in the regional home care radius
(60 km); expected to be discharged with home
nursing care; English or French speaking; admit-
ted for more than 24 hours to the nursing units;
and, not cognitively impaired (score 8 on Short
Portable Mental Status Exam).17,18 The study re-
ceived approval from the institutional Ethics Re-
view Board of the Ottawa Civic Hospital and Loeb
Health Research Institute.
Randomization
Using a computer-generated schedule, consent-
ing patients were randomized by the research
coordinator, within 24 hours of hospital admis-
sion, to receive either Usual Care or Transitional
Care.
Prepackaged,
consecutively
numbered,
sealed, opaque envelopes containing the group
allocation were prepared for each nursing unit and
administered from the research office. Neither the
patients, nor the members of the study team, were
aware of treatment assignment until after ran-
domization. During hospitalization, the staff phy-
sicians established the medical regimen. Other
usual providers included hospital and community
primary nurses and the home care coordinators.
Usual discharge procedures are described and
compared with Transitional Care in Table 1. With
respect to usual discharge planning and postdis-
charge care, patients in the control group received
optimal usual care in that the timing and number
of home nurse visits were scheduled to match
those received by Transitional Care group. The
similar number of home visiting and provider
contacts during the intervention period (2 weeks
after hospital discharge) controlled for the effect of
attention alone.
On admission to hospital, the research coordi-
nator flagged the patient’s chart as a signal to the
patient’s primary nurse to follow a checklist of
activities for Transitional Care. The protocol was
implemented from admission to 2 weeks after
hospital discharge, after which the patient received
usual care by community nurses while on home
care. During the pilot study for this trial, the 10 to
14 days after hospital discharge was identified as
the critical ‘settling in’period after hospitalization.
It was also a typical length of stay for home care
follow-up after hospitalization. Eleven individuals
were readmitted to hospital within 2 weeks of
discharge (the intervention period). Timing for
outcome measures then began on the second
discharge and followed for 3 months.
Usual Care and the Transitional Care
Intervention
Usual care for hospital-to-home transfer in-
volves completion of medical history, nursing as-
sessment form, and, in ideal circumstances within
24 hours of hospital admission, a multidisciplinary
discharge plan. Weekly discharge planning meet-
ings further identify patient needs. A regional
home care co-coordinator consults with the hos-
pital team as required and may meet directly with
patients and families. Immediately before dis-
charge, a physician completes a referral for home
care, and necessary services and supplies are com-
municated to the home nursing agency. Usual
home nursing care for CHF patients includes
assessment and monitoring, health teaching, pro-
vision of direct care, eg, administration of medica-
tions, and managing equipment and treatments.
Patients in the Transitional Care (TC) arm re-
ceived the standard discharge planning and care,
plus a comprehensive program, adding supports
to improve the transfer from hospital to home. To
develop this program, hospital and community
nurses met to focus on the ‘outreach’ from the
hospital and ‘in-reach’from the community during
the transition. An intersectoral continuity of care
framework19 guided their efforts in identifying
gaps to specifically address 3 major aspects of a

hospital-to-home transition: (1) supportive care
for self-management; (2) linkages between hospi-
tal and home nurses and patients; and (3) the
balance of care between the patient and family
and professional providers. The defining charac-
teristics of TC were the use of a structured, com-
prehensive, evidenced-based protocol for counsel-
ing
and
education
for
heart
failure
self-
management,
plus
additional
and
planned
linkages to support individuals in taking charge of
aspects of their care. An evidence-based interven-
tion is defined as care based by current research or,
in the absence of strong empirical findings, on
expert consensus. This may involve the use of
professional practice standards and practice guide-
lines, if available.
The
education-counseling
protocol
entitled,
Partners in Care for Congestive Heart Failure
(PCCHF), was developed in response to AHCPR
guideline recommendations.4 PCCHF has two
clinical components: (1) the patient workbook,
and (2) an education map that provided the overall
education plan, and serving as a patient-held
documentation tool.20–22 The workbook, a com-
prehensive resource for self-management, pro-
vides a structured approach for patient education,
yet allows for tailoring to individual needs.20,21 It
covers the basics of heart function and self-mon-
itoring—what CHF means, management of med-
ications, diet, exercise, stress, support systems, and
community resources. There is a pocket for insert-
ing patient-specific information (eg, medication,
dietary handouts). Linkages, additional to usual
practice, were created among providers and the
patients including: a nursing transfer letter to the
home care nurse detailing clinical status and self-
management needs; a telephone outreach from
the hospital nurse within 24 hours of discharge;
notification to home care as to whom hospital
primary nurse was for follow-up consult if neces-
sary; and a patient-held documentation tool.
Data Collection and Outcomes Measures
The primary outcome was health-related qual-
ity of life, symptom distress and function at 6- and
12-weeks postdischarge, as measured by the Min-
nesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire
(MLHFQ), a condition specific instrument.23–25
Secondary outcome measures included: quality of
life measured with a generic measure, the Medical
Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36),26–29 and the
number of all-cause emergency room visits and
hospital readmissions.
Hospital and home care clinical nursing staff
delivered care to both the Usual Care and the TC
groups. Two nurse research coordinators, reporting
through the Clinical Epidemiology Unit, managed
this trial. They were not connected in any way to
either the hospital or home care departments, and
wore research ID badges to avoid being mistaken

for
clinical
nursing
staff.
The
coordinators
screened and recruited the participants and col-
lected baseline data. On admission, profile infor-
mation was collected through chart audit using
standardized forms for demographic and circum-
stance of living data and clinical data, including
previous admissions, comorbidities, and severity of
medical problems from admitting notes and his-
tory. Outcome data were collected within 24 hours
of discharge (T1) and at two (T2), six (T3), and 12
weeks (T4) after hospital discharge. Appointments
in the home were made independent of scheduled
home care visits. Patients had the option to com-
plete the forms themselves or partake in a struc-
tured interview with the research staff. The major-
ity (90%) preferred the structured interview.
Analysis
The sample size was based on detecting a
clinically important difference in the Minnesota
Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire. From
changes in function and well-being experienced
by patients in placebo controlled angiotensin con-
verting enzyme inhibitor (ACE) trials, the devel-
opers of the scale determined that 5 points (4.8%)
was the minimally clinically important difference
(MCID) in score.23,25,30,31 With the probability of a
type I error set at 0.05 and power of 80%, 50
patients per group were required to detect a
5-point difference in the MLHFQ score, assuming
a SD of 9 for the change scores (personal commu-
nication, Thomas Rector, May 1996). Allowing for
30% withdrawal because of death or study drop-
out, and an additional 20% for sufficient statistical
power to perform physical and emotional dimen-
sion subscale analysis, 75 participants per group
were required.
Descriptive statistics (means, SD, proportions)
were used to determine the characteristics of those
completing the trial and the study dropouts. The
success of randomization was determined by com-
paring the intervention group with the Usual Care
group profile on demographic and clinical vari-
ables at baseline (T1) using 2 test for categorical
variables or the Student t test for continuous
variables.
Participants in the study were followed for 12
weeks after hospital discharge. All those complet-
ing outcome measures, whether they received the
intervention, were included in the analyses to
conduct an intention-to-treat/completer analysis.
The primary analysis tested the mean difference
in the condition-specific quality of life outcome
(MLHFQ) between baseline and 6 and 12 weeks
postdischarge with the 2 study groups. Mean
differences were compared using the independent
t test with either the pooled or separate variance
estimate as appropriate. To assess trends over
time, a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
compared each outcome across two factors: the
cohort (usual care or TC) and time (baseline and
after hospital discharge repeated measures). The
clinical importance was assessed using a mini-
mally clinical importance difference (MCID). The
MCID was defined as a 5-point or greater change
in the total MLHFQ score and 5% change in the
physical and emotional dimension scores (2 points
on the physical dimension score, 1.25 points on
the emotional dimension score). The scores are
calculated in whole numbers on a 5-point scale;
therefore, the MCID for the emotional dimension
was rounded upward to 2 points. Thus, a change of
 2 points was classified as ‘no change’. This had
the conservative effect of requiring a 12% deteri-
oration in score to be in the ‘worse’ category.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Trial Participants. In the 18 months of study
(June 1996 - January 1998), 483 patients with heart
failure were admitted to the two study units. Once
screened, 212 of these admissions were deemed
eligible, and 200 individuals consented to partici-
pate (5.6% refusal). Reasons for patient ineligibil-
ity included: coming from or being discharged to a
long-term care facility (n  104, 38%); living out-
side the catchment area for home care (n  63,
23%); too ill, or deceased, shortly after admission
(n  40, 15%); first language other than French or
English (n  33, 12%); being discharged 24
hours (n  16, 6%); diagnosis changed (n  8,
3%); other (n  7, 3%). After hospital admission
and baseline assessment, 8 of 200 consenting
participants (5 Transitional Care, 3 Usual Care) did
not subsequently enter the study after being ran-
domized (4 because of death/becoming too ill, 2
refusing home care, 1 change in diagnosis, 1
discharge to long-term care). The ‘too ill’ category
included being on life support, in palliative care or
in intensive care. Of the 192 remaining patients,
100 were randomly allocated to Usual Care and 92

to the TC group. Before the 12-week study com-
pletion, 20 people (11 Usual Care, 9 TC) died or
became too ill before the 12 weeks of study
completion, 8 withdrew (7 Usual Care, 1 TC), and
7 were a loss to follow-up (5 Usual Care, 2 TC).
Most of those randomized (81%, n  157) com-
pleted the study. The ‘intent to treat/completer’
analysis was conducted on 157 participants who
completed the outcome measures, whether they
received treatment.
The baseline profile (T1) of the study population
after randomization (n  192) was one of a fairly
elderly group. Less than 7% were under 60 years
of age and the mean age was 76 years (median 77
years, range 33–93 years). Most participants (91%)
were retired or on disability pension, and nearly
half lived alone. Most (76%) had at least some
high school education. Nearly 80% had NYHA
Functional Class4 III or IV as assessed by the nurse
research coordinator on admission. On average,
individuals took six prescription medications daily
(Table 2).
Comparability of Experimental and Control
Participants.
Profiles of those completing the study to 12
weeks (n  157) and those who did not com-
plete (n  35) were similar, with no statistically
significant differences on any of the demo-
graphic or clinical variables. A comparison of the
clinical, social and demographic characteristics
of the Usual Care and TC groups revealed
well-balanced groups with no statistically sig-
nificant differences in the baseline characteris-
tics between the experimental and control par-
ticipants (Table 2). A further comparison was
made with these characteristics and the 157
participants who completed the study, and
again, no differences were found.
Quality of Life
With the primary outcome measure, the ML-
HFQ, a lower score indicates less disability from
symptoms (range 0–105). The trend over time
with the total MLHFQ score is one of continued
improvement for the TC group (Fig. 1). The effect
of hospitalization and the intervention are inter-
twined at 2 weeks (T2). As expected, quality of life
for participants in both groups improved at the
2-week point (T2) as a hospital admission indi-
cates a pressing need for medical intervention.
Alleviation of the exacerbation precipitating the
hospitalization would be expected to result in
improvements, regardless of the group assign-
ment. While those receiving usual care showed no
further improvement at 6 and 12 weeks, the TC
group showed both clinical and statistically signif-
icant improvements in their reported health-
related quality of life (HRQL) (Table 3). The pat-
tern was similar with the MLHFQ physical
dimension score (Table 3). With the emotional
dimension of the MLHFQ, TC group the scores
improved significantly at T3 compared with base-
line and were sustained at 12 weeks, compared
with Usual Care participants who had no im-
provement in this score at 6 or 12 weeks.
Clinical Importance of the Quality of Life
Improvements
Relative changes in score between baseline and
T4 (T1-T4, divided by T1) provide an indication of
the clinical importance of the change in MLHFQ
scores (Table 3). For instance, in the total MLHFQ
scores at 12 weeks, the improvement from base-
line for the TC group was 43% compared with
14% for Usual Care group. With the physical
dimension, the TC group improved 42% from
baseline compared with 9% for Usual Care partic-
ipants. Although having only borderline statistical
significance, the relative change in score was
greatest with the MLHFQ emotional dimension
where improvement was 36% for the TC group,
compared with less than 1% with Usual Care.
To further understand the clinical importance of
the differences in MLHFQ scores, the proportion
of individuals in each group with a predefined
MCID score at 6 and 12 weeks were tabulated.
Classifying scores into ‘worse,’ ‘same,’ or ‘better’
revealed that, at 6 weeks, greater than 5 times the
number of Usual Care patients had deteriorated
(total MLHFQ) compared with the TC partici-
pants. At 12 weeks, statistically significant differ-
ences were seen in status, with TC improving in
both the total MLHFQ and the physical and
emotional dimensions (Table 4).
The SF-36, the secondary quality of life out-
come, included physical and mental component
scales and a general health subscale (five items). A
higher score indicates a better status with the
SF-36 scales. Table 5 illustrates the scores at base-

differences were noted in general health or the

scale, poor scores are seen in both groups across

the Usual Care group compared with 29% in the
TC group (2  4.86, df 1, P  0.03). Of those
accessing the emergency room multiple times
(range 1–5 visits), 50% of the Usual Care partici-
pants had more than one visit, compared with
32% of the TC group.
During the 12-week trial there were fewer TC
participants admitted to hospital (23%), compared
with 31% of the Usual Care group (2  0.28, df 1,
P  0.26). The sample size was inadequate to
detect this administratively and economically im-
portant reduction in hospital readmission associ-
ated with TC.
Discussion
Transitional Care resulted in improved CHF-
specific quality of life for individuals hospitalized
with heart failure and fewer subsequent visits to
emergency rooms. This study demonstrated that
with modest reorganization of discharge pro-
cesses, and the provision of an evidence-based
structure for patients and nurse providers to use
for
counseling
and
education,20–22
significant
gains can result. At 12-weeks after hospital dis-
charge, compared with baseline TC participants
were 13 points more improved in HRQL than
Usual Care participants, ie, a 68% greater im-
provement. Given the severity of illness of the
participants, this is a clinically important gain for
those receiving TC. Readmissions to hospitals
were showing a trend to lower rates but the study
was not powered to detect significant reductions
in this area. Not only was TC effective, but these
gains were achieved with no additional providers.
Other trials7,10–12,14 have reported positive find-
ings from innovative, interdisciplinary, nurse-led
approaches for discharge with the CHF population
but, in these studies, a case management role was
added.
This trial is unique in that it was designed and
powered using a HRQL measure as the primary

outcome. Previous studies have focused on health
service utilization as the primary outcome.7,10–12,14
Feeling better, as assessed by a specific HRQL
measure (MLHFQ), was associated with signifi-
cant changes in the use of emergency services.
This highlights the importance of evaluating
health services use in the context of self-reported
well-being. The impact of “emotional symptoms”
of individuals hospitalized with CHF is beginning
to be recognized.13 This factor may be one of the
most important in understanding and intercepting
emergency room and hospital use by those with
heart failure.
Clinical practice guidelines offer one strategy to
provide continuous, evidence-based care. Using a
guideline across various health sectors provides a
common script. With the CHF population, coordina-
tion and supportive assistance for self-management
with education are key recommendations,4 and im-
proving hospital-to-home transition for patients
with heart failure is a logical step in responding to
current practice guidelines.4,9,13,32 This trial has dem-
onstrated that with an aid, namely a patient booklet
and education map, usual providers can deliver
evidenced-based education and counseling across
sectors of care.
The experience in this study indicates the need
for both a generic and specific HRQL outcome
measure, an issue of continuing debate34–37 The
condition-specific HRQL measure (MLHFQ) was
more sensitive to changes in this study than the
generic measure (SF-36). A possible explanation is
the difficulty for individuals to separate the con-
tribution of particular co-morbidities to perceived
deficits. For instance, is the lack of mobility or
ability to assume normal social roles caused by
CHF or to arthritis? This trial was focused on an
intervention specific to CHF care; thus, alleviation
of symptoms would be more evident with a
condition-specific measure.33 Theoretically, be-
cause of the nature of complex health populations
having more than one prolonged condition, the
use of a generic instrument is helpful in determin-
ing overall HRQL. However, the potential im-
provements on general quality of life with a CHF
intervention in an elderly group, having more than
three comorbidities, may have been diminished by
the severity of their other conditions. More work
on the application of condition-specific and ge-
neric HRQL instruments with complex health
populations is required. However, having a generic
measure aids in the comparison of those with CHF
to other complex populations receiving supportive
interventions. Using both instruments in this trial
did not present an undue burden of administra-
tion with a fairly ill study population.
Limitations of this trial relate to conducting the
study in a naturalistic manner in the usual setting
of care with usual providers. Hospital nurses pro-
vided both experimental and control interven-
tions. This was unavoidable and the only feasible
means to conduct such a trial in the clinical
setting, and not unduly disrupt service organiza-
tion. There is a possibility of contamination with
the hospital nurses providing Usual Care (control
group) for, if the nurses were doing more than
Usual Care, it would bias the results by decreasing
the observed difference with TC. To assess the
possible impact of this limitation, verification that
the intervention happened and that the number of
events in the TC differed from Usual Care was
undertaken. Usual Care was likely made better by
the study protocol, eg, early after hospital admis-
sion, the process of assessment and home care
notification was rigorously adhered to in both
groups. Two home visits within the first 2 weeks
after hospital discharge were ordered and pro-
vided in both groups to account for attention
effect. Consequently, Usual Care clients may have
received extra care than may have been normally
provided. Nevertheless, the effect from these ac-
knowledged limitations would tend to minimize
the difference in groups. Thus, any difference
would be a true and underestimated difference
attributable to the experimental maneuver. Blind-
ing was not 100% assured. Patients may have
inadvertently alerted the research coordinators of
their assignment to Usual Care or Transitional
Care either verbally or through the conspicuous
presence of the PCCHF patient booklet. However,
because the standardized outcome assessment
(MLHFQ, SF-36) were standardized self-reports,
we were reasonably confident that, even if assign-
ment was exposed, there was little chance for
impact on outcome results. Lastly, with multiple
interventions it is not easy to assess the relative
contribution of each component, nor the synergis-
tic effect of the sum of the parts. With TC, the
linkage aspects and supportive care for self-
management were inextricably intertwined.
A note on generalizability of the study is perti-
nent. This trial was conducted in an urban center
after discharge from a teaching hospital. The gen-
eral medical units served a wide range of heart
failure admissions including the elderly. The inter-
vention was acceptable to most whom the pro-

gram applied (94%), and 81% completed the
protocol. The length of follow-up (3 months) was
comparable to other trials. The patients in the trial
were ill with 77% having Stage III or IV NYHA
class, and most being elderly (median 77 years). It
is not known if similar results would be found with
a younger, less advanced CHF population.
Further research is needed. From a health services
perspective, guideline-driven interventions are an
important strategy to provide evidence-based care
and improve continuity. As seen in this study, the
impact of such an intervention had no effect on
general HRQL, yet demonstrated dramatic results on
condition-specific HRQL. The next step will be in
evaluating ways to tailor standard approaches to
patients by considering their full range of comorbid
conditions and social circumstances. Secondly, future
trials of CHF hospital transition interventions should
address the long-term care sector. Nearly 40% of
those not eligible for this trial were from long-term
care settings. Implications about outcome measure-
ment in health service trials of reorganization of
supportive care fall into two areas: (1) greater use of
self-reported measure versus measures previously
considered more objective, ones such as clinical
endpoints or health services utilization; and (2) use
of both a condition-specific and generic HRQL
instrument. Ultimately, the examination of economic
data in the context of self-reported, well-being data
will greatly enhance our understanding of health
service utilization. Lastly, components of the TC
intervention, particularly the PCCHF educational-
counseling approach, should be evaluated in settings
other than a teaching facility eg, primary care, com-
munity programs, and with individuals at earlier
stages of heart failure.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Transitional Care has an impor-
tant role to play in altering the course of patients
hospitalized with heart failure. Our results suggest
that with modest adjustments to usual discharge
and transition from hospital-to-home, patients
with CHF can experience improved quality of life,
and decreased use of emergency rooms, for 3
months after hospitalization. This approach will
provide the needed adjunct to current manage-
ment of heart failure. It may also have application
in the management of other complex medical
populations associated with frequent hospital use.
