However, these interventions are historically underutilized, particularly by African Americans.\n## METHODS AND RESULTS\nWe performed a prospective randomized intervention trial in patients with advanced HF who were hospitalized for acute decompensation at 3 urban hospitals, comparing the effect of palliative care consultation (PCC) with that of usual care. The primary end point was the proportion choosing comfort-oriented care (hospice and/or \"do not resuscitate\" [DNR] order) 3-6 months after randomization. A total of 85 patients (mean age 68 years, 91.8% African American) were enrolled over a 2-year period.

Data from all participants were included regardless of level of participation, using an intent-to-treat approach.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomized 1:1 to receive the Collaborative Care to Alleviate Symptoms and Adjust to Illness (CASA) intervention or usual care. The CASA intervention included collaborative symptom care provided by a nurse and psychosocial care provided by a social worker, both of whom worked with the patients' primary care clinicians and were supervised by a study primary care clinician, cardiologist, and palliative care physician.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary outcome was patient-reported heart failure-specific health status, measured by difference in change scores on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (range, 0-100) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included depression (measured by the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety (measured by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire), overall symptom distress (measured by the General Symptom Distress Scale), specific symptoms (pain, fatigue, and shortness of breath), number of hospitalizations, and mortality.\n## RESULTS\nOf 314 patients randomized (157 to intervention arm and 157 to control arm), there were 67 women and 247 men, mean (SD) age was 65.5 (11.4) years, and 178 (56.7%) had reduced ejection fraction.

Using a train-the-trainer approach, an external trainer supports staff in nursing homes to introduce a palliative care approach over the course of 1 year following a 6-steps program. The steps are (1) advance care planning with residents and family, (2) assessment, care planning, and review of needs and problems, (3) coordination of care via monthly multidisciplinary review meetings, (4) delivery of high-quality care focusing on pain and depression, (5) care in the last days of life, and (6) care after death.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe primary resident outcome was comfort in the last week of life measured after death by staff using the End-of-Life in Dementia Scale Comfort Assessment While Dying (EOLD-CAD; range, 14-42).

We assessed the effectiveness of early palliative care integrated with respiratory services for patients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness.\n## METHODS\nIn this single-blind randomised trial, we enrolled consecutive adults with refractory breathlessness and advanced disease from three large teaching hospitals and via general practitioners in South London. We randomly allocated (1:1) patients to receive either a breathlessness support service or usual care. Randomisation was computer generated centrally by the independent Clinical Trials Unit in a 1:1 ratio, by minimisation to balance four potential confounders: cancer versus non-cancer, breathlessness severity, presence of an informal caregiver, and ethnicity. The breathlessness support service was a short-term, single point of access service integrating palliative care, respiratory medicine, physiotherapy, and occupational therapy. Research interviewers were masked as to which patients were in the treatment group. Our primary outcome was patient-reported breathlessness mastery, a quality of life domain in the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire, at 6 weeks. All analyses were by intention to treat. Survival was a safety endpoint. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01165034.\n## FINDINGS\nBetween Oct 22, 2010 and Sept 28, 2012, 105 consenting patients were randomly assigned (53 to breathlessness support service and 52 to usual care). 83 of 105 (78%) patients completed the assessment at week 6. Mastery in the breathlessness support service group improved compared with the control (mean difference 0\u00b758, 95% CI 0\u00b701-1\u00b715, p=0\u00b7048; effect size 0\u00b744). Sensitivity analysis found similar results. Survival rate from randomisation to 6 months was better in the breathlessness support service group than in the control group (50 of 53 [94%] vs 39 of 52 [75%]) and in overall survival (generalised Wilcoxon 3\u00b790, p=0\u00b7048). Survival differences were significant for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease but not cancer.\n## INTERPRETATION\nThe breathlessness support service improved breathlessness mastery. Our findings provide robust evidence to support the early integration of palliative care for patients with diseases other than cancer and breathlessness as well as those with cancer. The improvement in survival requires further investigation.\n## FUNDING\nUK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and Cicely Saunders International.\n",

            "abstract": "The specific aim of the PEACE pilot study was to determine the feasibility of a fully powered study to test the effectiveness of an in-home geriatrics/palliative care interdisciplinary care management intervention for improving measures of utilization, quality of care, and quality of life in enrollees of Ohio's community-based long-term care Medicaid waiver program, PASSPORT. This was a randomized pilot study (n=40 intervention [IG], n=40 usual care) involving new enrollees into PASSPORT who were >60 years old. This was an in-home interdisciplinary chronic illness care management intervention by PASSPORT care managers collaborating with a hospital-based geriatrics/palliative care specialist team and the consumer's primary care physician. This pilot was not powered to test hypotheses; instead, it was hypothesis generating. Primary outcomes measured symptom control, mood, decision making, spirituality, and quality of life. Little difference was seen in primary outcomes; however, utilization favored the IG. At 12 months, the IG had fewer hospital visits (50% vs. 55%, P=0.65) and fewer nursing facility admissions (22.5% vs. 32.5%, P=0.32). Using hospital-based specialists interfacing with a community agency to provide a team-based approach to care of consumers with chronic illnesses was found to be feasible. Lack of change in symptom control or quality of life outcome measures may be related to the tools used, as these were validated in populations closer to the end of life. Data from this pilot study will be used to calculate the sample size needed for a fully powered trial.\n",

We included patients 65 years or older with heart failure, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cirrhosis, who were able to give informed consent and who spoke English This study was a randomized, prospective, clinical trial. The intervention group received a PMC on enrollment and every weekday during hospitalization. Four physicians shared PMC duties. The PMC physician saw intervention patients daily, routinely assessed symptoms and psychosocial and spiritual needs, discussed treatment preferences, and consulted a pharmacist and chaplain as needed. The PMC physician communicated findings and recommendations to the patient's team via a medical chart note and by telephone. The usual care group received a brief visit from the PMC physician who gave them a packet of information on diet and exercise. On admission, we used the Activities of Daily Living (ADL)7 and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) scales8 to categorize each subject as dependent or independent. Participants reporting the need for assistance with any 1 of 13 tasks were categorized as dependent. We used the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) to assess depression.9 Responses were scored 1 = \u201cno\u201d and \u201cdon't know\u201d and 0 = \u201cyes\u201d and summed. Total scores of 6 or higher indicated the patient may be depressed. Pain, dyspnea, and anxiety were assessed daily by a research assistant who was blinded to group assignment and asked patients to rate each symptom at its worst level in the past 24 hours from 0 (\u201cnone\u201d) to 10 (\u201cthe worst you can imagine\u201d). Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group. All patients completed a telephone survey 2 weeks after discharge to reassess symptoms, rate physician and nursing care, and recall discussions of preferences. We reviewed medical records to determine patients' primary diagnosis on admission. This study was undertaken between January 2002 and December 2003 and approved by the University of California, San Francisco Committee on Human Research. All participants gave written informed consent. Frequencies, means, and standard deviations were used to examine the distribution of measures. We used \u03c72 analysis to test for bivariate associations between categorical variables. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to investigate the impact of the intervention on symptom severity over different assessment periods. We used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Mac (version 17; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois; March 11, 2009). \n## Results\nWe enrolled 107 patients (intervention, n = 54; usual care, n = 53); 81 patients (76%; intervention, n = 41; usual care, n = 40) completed follow-up surveys. Most patients were male (62%) and white (71%) and had some college education (56%). The mean (SD) age was 76 (7.5) years, and 45% were married or partnered. The primary diagnoses were heart failure (51%; mean ejection fraction, 23%); cancer (22%; type: prostate, 22%; lung, 18%; and bladder, 13%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20%; mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 1.5 L); and cirrhosis (6%; mean Model for Endstage Liver Disease score, 16). The mean (SD) hospital length of stay was 5.5 (5.8) days. Most participants were dependant in 1 or more ADL (71%), and 21% had a GDS-IS score of 6 or higher. The groups differed in mean age (77 and 74 years in the intervention and usual care groups, respectively; P = .007) but not in other characteristics. Symptom scores for all subjects improved from baseline to follow-up for pain (4.2 vs 2.3; P <.001), dyspnea (3.8 vs 2.0; P  <.001), and anxiety (4.8 vs 2.4; P <.001). There was no additional improvement in pain (P = .30), dyspnea (P = .50), or anxiety (P = .08) for patients assigned to the intervention at any assessment period (Figure). At follow-up, most patients believed that the staff understood what they were going through and that physicians and nurses listened to their hopes, fears, and beliefs (Table). However, a minority of patients reported that the physician discussed their preferences for care (43%), their chance of surviving hospitalization (42%), or their religious beliefs (31%). There were no differences between groups for any of these items.",

A specifically trained nurse had multiple contacts with the patient, family, physician, and hospital staff to elicit preferences, improve understanding of outcomes, encourage attention to pain control, and facilitate advance care planning and patient-physician communication.\n## RESULTS\nThe phase I observation documented shortcomings in communication, frequency of aggressive treatment, and the characteristics of hospital death: only 47% of physicians knew when their patients preferred to avoid CPR: 46% of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were written within 2 days of death; 38% of patients who died spent at least 10 days in an intensive care unit (ICU); and for 50% of conscious patients who died in the hospital, family members reported moderate to severe pain at least half the time.

A palliative care approach would nonetheless seem to be appropriate in various care settings, including the acute care hospital.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a randomized controlled trial of palliative care in patients with advanced dementia (Functional Assessment Staging Tool [FAST] stage 6d-7f) who were hospitalized with acute illness. Intervention patients received recommendations by a palliative care team with the goal of enhancing patient comfort; control patients received usual care without these recommendations.\n## RESULTS\nAmong 99 patients enrolled over 3 years, groups were comparable at baseline in terms of gender, age, race, dementia stage, and advance directive status. Outcomes were similar in terms of mean number of hospitalizations, average length of stay, and mortality. Intervention patients were more likely than control patients to receive a palliative care plan (23% versus 4%; p = 0.008), usually on discharge, and more decisions were made to forgo certain medical treatments but the numbers were small. Fewer patients in the intervention group received intravenous therapy throughout the admission (66% vs. 81%, p = 0.025). Overall, additional interventions included daily phlebotomy for at least half of the admission (41%), systemic antibiotics (75%), and new feeding tubes (44%). Including tubes present at the time of randomization, a total of 69% received long-term enteral feeding.\n## CONCLUSION\nIt was difficult for a palliative care research team to influence the care of advanced dementia patients in the acute hospital setting. When patients have advanced dementia, there may be unique barriers, including perceived prognostic uncertainty, difficulty assessing comfort level, and perceptions about tube feeding. There must be a reexamination of treatment approaches for this severely impaired group of patients. Further study should attempt to identify patients prior to the need for acute hospitalization so goals can be established when there is less urgency to make life and death decisions.\n",

Study interventions and assessments were administered over the telephone and internet by clinical and research teams in San Francisco, California, and Omaha, Nebraska. Of 2585 referred or volunteer PWD-caregiver dyads in California, Iowa, or Nebraska, 780 met eligibility criteria and were enrolled. A total of 512 PWD-caregiver dyads were randomized to receive care through the Care Ecosystem and 268 dyads to receive usual care. All eligible PWDs had a dementia diagnosis; were enrolled or eligible for enrollment in Medicare or Medicaid; and spoke English, Spanish, or Cantonese. Analyses were intention-to-treat.\n## INTERVENTION\nTelephone-based collaborative dementia care was delivered by a trained care team navigator, who provided education, support and care coordination with a team of dementia specialists (advanced practice nurse, social worker, and pharmacist).\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nPrimary outcome measure: Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease based on caregiver's rating of 13 aspects of PWD's well-being (including physical health, energy level, mood, living situation, memory, relationships, and finances) on a 4-point scale (poor to excellent). Secondary outcomes: frequencies of PWDs' use of emergency department, hospitalization, and ambulance services; caregiver depression (score on 9-Item Patient Health Questionnaire; higher scores indicate more severe depression); and caregiver burden (score on 12-Item Zarit Burden Interview; higher scores indicate more severe caregiver burden).\n## RESULTS\nThe 780 PWDs (56.3% female; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [9.9] years) and 780 caregivers (70.9% female; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [12.0] years) lived in California (n\u2009=\u2009452), Nebraska (n\u2009=\u2009284), or Iowa (n\u2009=\u200944). Of 780 dyads, 655 were still active at 12 months, and 571 completed the 12-month survey. Compared with usual care, the Care Ecosystem improved PWD quality of life (B, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25-1.30; P\u2009=\u2009.04), reduced emergency department visits (B, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.01; P\u2009=\u2009.04), and decreased caregiver depression (B, -1.14; 95% CI, -2.15 to -0.13; P\u2009=\u2009.03) and caregiver burden (B, -1.90; 95% CI, -3.89 to -0.08; P\u2009=\u2009.046).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nEffective care management for dementia can be delivered from centralized hubs to supplement usual care and mitigate the growing societal and economic burdens of dementia.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02213458.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nBreathlessness is the most common and intrusive symptom of advanced non-malignant respiratory and cardiac conditions. The Breathlessness Intervention Service (BIS) is a multi-disciplinary complex intervention, theoretically underpinned by a palliative care approach, utilising evidence-based non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions to support patients with advanced disease in managing their breathlessness. Having published the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of BIS for patients with advanced cancer and their carers, we sought to establish its effectiveness, and cost effectiveness, in advanced non-malignant conditions.\n## METHODS\nThis was a single-centre Phase III fast-track single-blind mixed method RCT of BIS versus standard care for breathless patients with non-malignant conditions and their carers. Randomisation was to one of two groups (randomly permuted blocks). Eighty-seven patients referred to BIS were randomised (intervention arm n\u2009=\u200944; control arm n\u2009=\u200943 received BIS after four-week wait); 79 (91\u00a0%) completed to key outcome measurement. The primary outcome measure was 0-10 numeric rating scale for patient distress due to breathlessness at four weeks. Secondary outcome measures were Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Client Service Receipt Inventory, EQ-5D and topic-guided interviews.\n## RESULTS\nQualitative analyses showed the positive impact of BIS on patients with non-malignant conditions and their carers; quantitative analyses showed a non-significant greater reduction in the primary outcome ('distress due to breathlessness'), when compared to standard care, of -0.24 (95\u00a0% CI: -1.30, 0.82). BIS resulted in extra mean costs of \u00a3799, reducing to \u00a3100 when outliers were excluded; neither difference was statistically significant. The quantitative findings contrasted with those previously reported for patients with cancer and their carers, which showed BIS to be both clinically and cost effective. For patients with non-malignant conditions there was a notable trend of improvement over both trial arms to the key measurement point; participants may have experienced a therapeutic effect from the research interviews, diluting the intervention's impact.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBIS had a statistically non-significant effect for patients with non-malignant conditions, and slightly increased service costs, but had a qualitatively positive impact consistent with findings for advanced cancer. Trials of palliative care interventions should consider multiple, mixed method, primary outcomes and ensure that protocols limit potential contaminating therapeutic effects in study designs.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nCurrent Controlled Trials ISRCTN04119516 (December 2008); ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00678405 (May 2008).\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nDespite their poor prognosis, patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have little access to palliative care and tend to have a high rate of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions during their last year of life.\n## OBJECTIVES\nTo determine the feasibility of a home palliative care intervention during 1 year versus usual care, and the possible impact of this intervention on emergency, hospital and ICU admissions, survival, mood, and health-related quality of life (HRQL).\n## METHODS\nProspective controlled study of patients with severe COPD (GOLD stage III or IV) and long-term oxygen therapy and/or home noninvasive ventilation and/or one or more hospital admissions in the previous year for acute exacerbation, randomized to usual care versus usual care with add-on monthly intervention by palliative care specialists at home for 12 months.\n## RESULTS\nOf 315 patients screened, 49 (15.5%) were randomized (26 to early palliative care; 23 to the control group); aged (mean \u00b1 SD) 71 \u00b1 8 years; FEV1 was 37 \u00b1 14% predicted; 88% with a COPD assessment test score > 10; 69% on long-term oxygen therapy or home noninvasive ventilation. The patients accepted the intervention and completed the assessment scales. After 1 year, there was no difference between groups in symptoms, HRQL and mood, and there was a nonsignificant trend for higher admission rates to hospital and emergency wards in the intervention group.\n## CONCLUSION\nAlthough this pilot study was underpowered to formally exclude a benefit from palliative care in severe COPD, it raises several questions as to patient selection, reluctance to palliative care in this group, and modalities of future trials.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nPatients with COPD consistently express a desire to discuss end-of-life care with clinicians, but these discussions rarely occur. We assessed whether an intervention using patient-specific feedback about preferences for discussing end-of-life care would improve the occurrence and quality of communication between patients with COPD and their clinicians.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a cluster-randomized trial of clinicians and patients from the outpatient clinics at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System. Using self-reported questionnaires, we assessed patients' preferences for communication, life-sustaining therapy, and experiences at the end of life. The intervention clinicians and patients received a one-page patient-specific feedback form, based on questionnaire responses, to stimulate conversations. The control group completed questionnaires but did not receive feedback. Patient-reported occurrence and quality of end-of-life communication (QOC) were assessed within 2 weeks of a targeted visit. Intention-to-treat regression analyses were performed with generalized estimating equations to account for clustering of patients within clinicians.\n## RESULTS\nNinety-two clinicians contributed 376 patients. Patients in the intervention arm reported nearly a threefold higher rate of discussions about end-of-life care (unadjusted, 30% vs 11%; P < .001). Baseline end-of-life communication was poor (intervention group QOC score, 23.3; 95% CI, 19.9-26.8; control QOC score, 19.2; 95% CI, 15.9-22.4). Patients in the intervention arm reported higher-quality end-of-life communication that was statistically significant, although the overall improvement was small (Cohen effect size, 0.21).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA one-page patient-specific feedback form about preferences for end-of-life care and communication improved the occurrence and quality of communication from patients' perspectives.\n## TRIAL REGISTRY\nClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00106080; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThe growing number of patients with congestive heart failure has increased both the pressure on hospital resources and the need for community management of the condition. Improving hospital-to-home transition for this population is a logical step in responding to current practice guidelines' recommendations for coordination and education. Positive outcomes have been reported from trials evaluating multiple interventions, enhanced hospital discharge, and follow-up through the addition of a case management role. The question remains if similar gains could be achieved working with usual hospital and community nurses.\n## METHODS\nA 12-week, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted of the effect of transitional care on health-related quality of life (disease-specific and generic measures), rates of readmission, and emergency room use. The nurse-led intervention focused on the transition from hospital-to-home and supportive care for self-management 2 weeks after hospital discharge.\n## RESULTS\nAt 6 weeks after hospital discharge, the overall Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score was better among the Transitional Care patients (27.2 +/- 19.1 SD) than among the Usual Care patients (37.5 +/- 20.3 SD; P = 0.002). Similar results were found at 12 weeks postdischarge for the overall MLHFQ and at 6- and 12-weeks postdischarge for the MLHFQ's Physical Dimension and Emotional Dimension subscales. Differences in generic quality life, as assessed by the SF-36 Physical component, Mental Component, and General Health subscales, were not significantly different between the Transition and Usual Care groups. At 12 weeks postdischarge, 31% of the Usual Care patients had been readmitted compared with 23% of the Transitional Care patients (P = 0.26), and 46% of the Usual Care group visited the emergency department compared with 29% in the Transitional Care group (chi2 = 4.86, df 1, P = 0.03).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThere were significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL) associated with Transitional Care and less use of emergency rooms.\n",
