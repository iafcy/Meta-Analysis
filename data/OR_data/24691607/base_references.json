            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy improves the success of autologous blood (AB) donation programs before elective surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate iron absorption during an AB donation program with or without rHuEPO.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-two patients were randomly assigned among placebo (Group 1) or 300 (Group 2) or 600 UI per kg rHuEPO (Group 3) on the first, second, and third donation visits. All patients also received daily oral iron (200 mg Fe(+)).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The number of units collected in Group 3 was higher than in Group 1 (4.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.8 units; p < 0.01). Red blood cell (RBC) production increased in a rHuEPO dose-dependent manner. With rHuEPO, the RBC volume collected per unit presented a lower decrease with number of donated units than with placebo and was similar to that of homologous blood units. Storage iron did not influence the number of units collected, whereas circulating mobilizable iron was the limiting factor. Oral iron absorption increased in a rHuEPO dose-dependent manner (12-fold with 600 UI/kg rHuEPO) and was proportional to erythropoietic activity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      rHuEPO does not only improve the number of AB units collected but also their quality. Storage iron cannot meet marrow iron requirements, but rHuEPO strongly increased oral iron absorption in a dose-dependent fashion through stimulation of erythropoietic activity."

            "abstract": "Fifty-two (41 females, 11 males) overweight patients, mean body mass index (BMI) = 29.3, were treated for 6 months in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design. The treatment consisted of an energy restricted diet and a dietary fibre supplement amounting to 7 g/day. After treatment the weight reduction in the fibre-treated group, 5.5 +/- 0.7 kg, was significantly higher than that of the placebo group, 3.0 +/- 0.5 kg (P = 0.005). Both groups were normotensive and comparable commencing treatment, 126.5/75.6 +/- 2.0/1.3 mm Hg versus 126.7/78.7 +/- 2.5/1.6 mm Hg. The treatment changed blood pressure non-significantly. Hunger feelings using visual analogue scales (VAS) were significantly reduced from 139.8 +/- 8.2 cm to 118.3 +/- 7.0 cm in the fibre-treated group, whereas a significant increase from 129.5 +/- 6.9 cm to 146.9 +/- 8.8 cm (P less than 0.02) was seen in the placebo group. Side-effects were predominantly gastrointestinal and equally distributed in the two groups. It is concluded that a dietary fibre supplement is of value in the management of overweight, enhancing weight loss and decreasing hunger feelings."

We aimed to develop a RBC demand model to assess the impact of restriction policies on RBC use and patient outcomes.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      A compartmental dynamic model was developed in which patients require RBCs acutely (within 1 hr), urgently (24 hr), semiurgently (1-7 days), or nonurgently; outcomes included death or remaining at or transitioning to more or less urgent categories. A mathematical model was developed with transitions governed by differential equations and calibrated to a baseline scenario of adequate blood supply (using population-based hospital data sets, registries, and RBC issues). Distribution into urgency categories was based on a prospective study of 5132 randomly selected RBC units. Scenarios when the blood supply is limited compared to baseline were investigated. Transition rates between urgency categories under these scenarios were established by clinician survey.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the baseline 21-day scenario, patients requiring the most RBCs were other surgery (2162, 22%), medical anemia (1916, 12%), malignant hematology (1092, 16%), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (1115, 8%). A policy of withholding RBCs for all nonurgent indications results in an estimated reduction of only 1007 (11.2%) RBC units and, if extended to semiurgent, a reduction of 2567 (28.5%) RBC units.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Based on this model, restrictions that withhold transfusion from nonurgent patients have minimal impact on RBC demand and may not be sufficient to address changed demand and/or decreased supply during a prolonged disaster."

Therefore, the objective of this evaluation was to compare the perioperative transfusion of blood components in cardiac surgery in multiple centers in different countries.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      Transfusion practice was investigated prospectively in 70 centers among 16 countries. A total of 5065 randomly selected cardiac surgery patients of the Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia Epidemiology II (EPI II) Study were evaluated.

            "abstract": "Linezolid is an important therapeutic option for infections from multi-drug resistant Gram-positive pathogens. However, prolonged linezolid treatment (>14 days) is considered to increase the risk of hematological adverse events. We aimed to evaluate the hematological safety profile of an i.v. single dose of linezolid in healthy volunteers of different body weight. We conducted a phase I clinical trial involving 20 healthy male Chinese volunteers that received an i.v. single dose of linezolid (600 mg). The study participants were assigned to two groups: low-weight (LW) group: 50 kg <body weight ≤55 kg and high-weight (HW) group: ≥80 kg. A significant decrease in the hemoglobin (Hb) levels and red blood cell (RBC) count was observed at the end of administration of the study drug in both groups. White blood cell (WBC) count was simultaneously decreased in the HW group. In the LW group, Hb levels and RBC count were also significantly decreased at 5, 7 and 24 h. In the HW group, both values were significantly decreased at 5 h. At 48 h all values were normal. The observed decreases were numerically higher in the LW group compared with the HW group. Yet, no statistical significance was noted. No difference was observed in the platelet count in both the groups. Our findings suggest that linezolid-associated hematological toxicity may also occur shortly after the i.v. administration of the drug in both LW and HW healthy volunteers. Early initiated continuous monitoring of hematological values and linezolid dosage adjustment for body weight are recommended."

            "abstract": "We performed a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to study whether early treatment with erythropoietin could prevent the development of acute kidney injury in patients in two general intensive care units. As a guide for choosing the patients for treatment we measured urinary levels of two biomarkers, the proximal tubular brush border enzymes gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase. Randomization to either placebo or two doses of erythropoietin was triggered by an increase in the biomarker concentration product to levels above 46.3, with a primary outcome of relative average plasma creatinine increase from baseline over 4 to 7 days. Of 529 patients, 162 were randomized within an average of 3.5 h of a positive sample. There was no difference in the incidence of erythropoietin-specific adverse events or in the primary outcome between the placebo and treatment groups. The triggering biomarker concentration product selected patients with more severe illness and at greater risk of acute kidney injury, dialysis, or death; however, the marker elevations were transient. Early intervention with high-dose erythropoietin was safe but did not alter the outcome. Although these two urine biomarkers facilitated our early intervention, their transient increase compromised effective triaging. Further, our study showed that a composite of these two biomarkers was insufficient for risk stratification in a patient population with a heterogeneous onset of injury."

To successfully minimize the need for blood transfusion, a systematic approach is needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of different anesthetic techniques, general vs combine epidural and general anesthesia, as well as different surgery strategies, on-pump vs off-pump, on postoperative bleeding complications and the need for blood transfusions during perioperative period.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-two consecutive patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery were randomized according to surgical and anesthetic techniques into 4 different groups: group 1 (patients operated on off-pump, under general anesthesia); group 2 (patients operated on off-pump, with combined general and high thoracic epidural anesthesia); group 3 (patients operated on using standard revascularization technique, with the use of extracorporeal circulation, under general anesthesia), and group 4 (patients operated on using standard revascularization technique, with the use of extracorporeal circulation, with combined general and high thoracic epidural anesthesia). Indications for transfusion were based on clinical judgment, but a restrictive policy was encouraged.

Intracerebral hemorrhage lacks an effective medical or surgical treatment despite the acknowledged pathophysiologic benefits of achieved hemostasis and clot removal. Image-guided stereotactic endoscopic hematoma evacuation is a promising minimally invasive approach designed to limit operative injury and maximize hematoma removal.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A single-center randomized controlled trial was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of stereotactic hematoma evacuation compared to best medical management. Patients were randomized within 24 hours of hemorrhage in a 3:2 fashion to best medical management plus endoscopic hematoma evacuation or best medical management alone. Data were collected to assess efficacy and safety of hematoma evacuation and to identify procedural components requiring technical improvement.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ten patients have been enrolled and randomized to treatment. Six patients underwent endoscopic evacuation with a hematoma volume reduction of 80% +/- 13% at 24 hours post procedure. The medical arm demonstrated a hematoma enlargement of 78% +/- 142% during this same period. Rehemorrhage rates and deterioration rates were similar in the 2 groups. Mortality was 20% in the endoscopic group and 50% in the medical treatment cohort. The endoscopic technique was shown to be effective in identification and evacuation of hematomas, whereas reduction in the number of endoscopic passes and maintenance of hemostasis require further study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Image-guided stereotactic endoscopic hematoma removal is a promising minimally invasive technique that is effective in immediate hematoma evacuation.

Anemia with hemoglobin levels below 7.5 g per deciliter developed in 24 percent of AZT recipients and 4 percent of placebo recipients (P less than 0.001). Twenty-one percent of AZT recipients and 4 percent of placebo recipients required multiple red-cell transfusions (P less than 0.001).

Concurrent use of acetaminophen was also associated with a higher frequency of hematologic toxicity. Although a subset of patients tolerated AZT for an extended period with few toxic effects, the drug should be administered with caution because of its toxicity and the limited experience with it to date."

Seventy-nine per cent of subjects wore their MAA for at least 4 hours at night. Sixty-eight per cent of subjects wore their MAA for 6-7 nights per week. Excessive salivation was the most commonly reported complication. One subject was unable to tolerate the MAA and withdrew from the study. Among the remaining 20 subjects, the MAA produced significantly lower AHI and ODI values than the placebo. However, although the reported frequency and loudness of snoring and the ESS values were lower with the MAA than the placebo, these differences were not statistically significant.

            "abstract": "A feasibility trial to investigate the practicality of determining the advantages and disadvantages of prompt pharmacologic treatment for mild hypertension was jointly funded by the Veterans Administration and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Its clinical phase has been completed, and it demonstrated 1. that the required relatively young asymptomatic population could be enrolled in the study and 2. that it could be persuaded to adhere to the protocol for 2 years; however, it was evident that intensive efforts would be required in both areas. The feasibility trial screened almost 120,000 potential subjects over a period of 16 months to randomize about 1,000 subjects at four clinical centers. These men and women were 21 to 50 years old, had diastolic pressures from 85 to 105 mm Hg as outpatients, and had no evidence of cardiovascular renal abnormalities. They were randomized in double-blind fashion into active drug therapy and placebo groups. Stepped care therapy involved 50 mg chlorthalidone (Step 1), 100 mg chlorthalidone (Step 2) and 100 chlorthalidone plus 0.25 mg reserpine (Step 3). Death, myocardial infarction, stroke, angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure were the \"major\" morbid events that were looked for; also recorded were \"minor\" morbid events consisting primarily of electrocardiographic arrhythmias. The development of significant hypertension was considered a treatment failure. Side effects were carefully tabulated in both active drug and placebo groups. The study revealed an average drop in diastolic pressure of almost 12 mm Hg for active drug group and less than half of that for the placebo group; once established 6 months after randomization, the new pressure levels persisted almost without change throughout the study. Although the feasibility trial was not designed to answer the primary question regarding the benefits of treatment, the events were tabulated for each group. A total of 12 placebo-treated subjects developed significant hypertension and were put on active drug. There was not a significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of \"major\" morbid events; a total of eight active and five placebo patients developed myocardial infarction or died suddenly. There, however, was an excess of arrhythmias among the active drug subjects (17 in the active group versus 8 in the placebo group on the basis of preliminary data). Finally, there were twice as many side effects and 20 times as many chemical abnormalities among the active as among the placebo subjects. A protocol for a full scale study of the benefits of pharmacologic therapy in mild hypertensives has been prepared and is ready for implementation as needed; it involves relatively minor modifications of the protocol tested in the feasibility trial."

Phase II in hospital clinical trials, as well as in vitro and in vivo work, suggest that resuscitation with an HBOC--in lieu of stored RBCs--attenuates the systemic inflammatory response invoked in the pathogenesis of MOF.

Group 2 patients were transfused with their own (autologous) blood, salvaged post-operatively, although donor blood was also available to them if needed. The two groups were further subdivided according to whether the patients received aspirin pre-operatively or not. The four subgroups thus formed were comparable pre- as well as intra-operatively, with respect to all available clinical and laboratory criteria. The post-operative data, however, showed that the combination of pre-operative aspirin and autotransfusion leads to excessive post-operative bleeding, together with increased donor blood requirement. It was also shown that autotransfusion without aspirin does reduce the need for donor blood transfusion without any increase in post-operative bleeding. Although aspirin alone did not increase post-operative bleeding or donor blood requirement, its combination with autotransfusion should be avoided."

Overall, 43% of the infants in the r-HuEPO group and 31% of placebo-treated infants were transfusion-free during the study (P = .18). The volume of blood removed for laboratory tests and the need for respiratory support at the start of treatment had major effects on transfusion requirements independent of r-HuEPO. Reticulocyte counts were higher during treatment in the r-HuEPO group (P = .0001), and r-HuEPO-treated infants had higher hematocrit values at the end of the study (32% versus 27.3% in the placebo group; P = .0001).

Hospitalization times, adverse events, and postoperative wound complications were also monitored. Blood loss during surgery and wound drainage volume was lower in the Vivostat group than in the control group, although the differences were not significantly different.

Laboratory and observational studies have raised the possibility that prolonged RBC storage may adversely affect clinical outcomes. Compared with RBCs stored less than 1 week, there are no clinical data demonstrating that RBCs stored longer remain as effective at carrying or releasing oxygen, and observational studies have risen to possibility that prolonged RBC storage might result in harm to vulnerable patients requiring blood transfusions. The \"Age of Blood Evaluation\" (ABLE) study (ISRCTN44878718) is a double-blind, multicenter, parallel randomized controlled clinical trial. It will test the hypothesis that the transfusion of prestorage leukoreduced RBCs stored for 7 days or less (fresh arm) as compared with standard-issue RBCs stored, on average, 15 to 20 days (control arm) will lead to lower 90-day all-cause mortality and reduced morbidity in critically ill adults. We include adults in intensive care units (ICUs) who (1) have had a request for a first RBC unit transfusion during the first 7 days of ICU admission and (2) have an anticipated requirement for ongoing invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation exceeding 48 hours. Enrolled patients are randomized at the time of transfusion to receive either standard-issue RBC units or RBCs stored 7 days or less issued by the local hospital transfusion service. The primary outcome is 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes include ICU and hospital mortality, organ failure, and serious nosocomial infections. With 2510 patients, we will be able to detect a 5% absolute risk reduction (from 25% to 20%). The ABLE study is currently enrolling patients in 23 university-affiliated and community-hospital ICUs across Canada; sites in France and United Kingdom are expected to start recruitment in 2011. Regardless of the results, ABLE study will have significant implications on the duration of RBC storage. A negative trial will reassure clinicians and blood bankers regarding the effectiveness and safety of standard-issue RBCs. A positive trial will have significant implications with respect to inventory management of RBCs given to critically ill adults with a high risk of mortality and will also prompt research to better understand the RBC storage lesion in the hopes of minimizing its clinical consequences through the development of better storage methods."

Vitamin K antagonist related intracerebral haemorrhage occurs in about 10% of patients. Intracerebral haemorrhage has the worst prognosis of all subtypes of stroke including spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, and a mortality rate of up to about 65%. The higher rate of haematoma expansion due to rebleeding is thought to be responsible for the higher mortality. Current international treatment recommendations include fresh frozen plasma and prothrombin complex concentrate. It is known that these substances lower the international normalised ratio, and thus it is assumed that normalisation of coagulopathy may lead to haemostasis and reduction of rebleeding. However, the issue of whether to use fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate for urgent reversal of vitamin K antagonists is unresolved: safety and efficacy of these treatments have never been studied in a randomised controlled trial. Our questions are: how effective are the two substances in normalisation of the international normalized ratio? How feasible is it to apply either of these treatments in an acute situation? What is the safety profile of each of these substances?

Patients will be included if a computed tomography scan shows an intraparenchymal or subdural haematoma within 12 h after onset of symptoms, if the patient is on treatment with vitamin K antagonists, and the international normalized ratio is ≥2.

From the 57 remaining patients, the number of units transfused averaged 5.5 +/- 8.43 red cell units in the experimental group compared to 3.3 +/- 3.27 red cell units in the standard group (P = 0.25). The median storage time was 4 days in the experimental group compared to 19 days in the standard group (difference of 15 days; interquartile range of 12-16 days; P < 0.001). Overall, 73% of patients received red cells with storage times that corresponded to the treatment allocation more than 90% of the time. The group receiving red cells <8 days old tended to be older on average (68 +/- 8.54 yr versus 63 +/- 15.30 yr; P = 0.13) and have more comorbid illnesses (85% versus 65%; P = 0.09). In total, 27% of patients in the experimental group died or had a life-threatening complication as compared to 13% in the standard group (P = 0.31). There were no differences in prolonged respiratory, cardiovascular, or renal support after randomization (P > 0.05). A large clinical trial comparing red cell storage times is feasible and warranted given the limited available evidence."

Previous studies have shown that limiting the amount of fluids given by following a strategy of permissive hypotension during the initial resuscitation period may improve trauma outcomes. This study examines the clinical outcomes from the first 90 patients enrolled in a prospective, randomized controlled trial of hypotensive resuscitation, with the primary aim of assessing the effects of a limited transfusion and intravenous (IV) fluid strategy on 30-day morbidity and mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients in hemorrhagic shock who required emergent surgery were randomized to one of the two arms of the study for intraoperative resuscitation.

Evidence demonstrates its consistent efficacy in reducing pain for a single painful procedure. The purpose of this study is to examine the sustained efficacy of KMC, provided during all routine painful procedures for the duration of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) hospitalization, in diminishing behavioral pain response in preterm neonates. The efficacy of KMC alone will be compared to standard care of 24% oral sucrose, as well as the combination of KMC and 24% oral sucrose.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      Infants admitted to the NICU who are less than 36 6/7 weeks gestational age (according to early ultrasound), that are stable enough to be held in KMC, will be considered eligible (N = 258).

The primary outcome is infant's pain intensity, which will be assessed using the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP). The secondary outcome will be maturity of neurobehavioral functioning, as measured by the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI). Gestational age, cumulative exposure to KMC provided during non-pain contexts, and maternal cortisol levels will be considered in the analysis.

            "abstract": "The question of whether storage of red blood cells (RBCs) alters their capacity to deliver oxygen and affects patient outcomes remains in a state of clinical equipoise. Studies of the changes which occur while RBCs are stored have led to several physiologically plausible hypotheses that these changes impair RBC function when the units are transfused. Although there is some evidence of this effect in vivo from animal model experiments, the results of several largely retrospective patient studies have not been consistent. Some studies have shown an association between worse clinical outcomes and transfusion of RBC which have been stored for longer periods of time, while others have found no effect. Three multicenter, randomized, controlled trials have been developed to address this important, but currently unanswered, question. Two clinical trials, one in low birth weight neonates and the other in intensive care unit patients, are enrolling subjects in Canada (the Age of Red Blood Cells in Premature Infants; the Age of Blood Study). The third trial, which is being developed in the United States, is the Red Cell Storage Duration Study (RECESS). This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial in which patients undergoing complex cardiac surgical procedures who are likely to require RBC transfusion will be randomized to receive RBC units stored for either 10 or fewer days or 21 or more days. Randomization will only occur if the blood bank has enough units of RBC of both storage times to meet the crossmatch request; hence, subjects randomized to the 21 day arm will receive RBC of the same storage time as they would have following standard inventory practice of \"oldest units out first\". The primary outcome is the change in the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS), a composite measure of multiorgan dysfunction, by day 7. Secondary outcomes include the change in the MODS by day 28, all-cause mortality, and several composite and single measures of specific organ system function. The estimated total sample size required will be 1434 evaluable subjects (717 per arm)."

The effects on bleeding as reflected by the amount of blood product support administered and a shortened bleeding time were assessed as secondary outcomes. Premature infants with a platelet count < 150 x 10(9)/L within the first 72 hours of life were randomly assigned to receive either conventional therapy or conventional therapy plus platelet concentrates (10 ml/kg). The platelet count was maintained < 150 x 10(9)/L until day 7 of life by one to three platelet transfusions. In 22 (28%) of the 78 treated infants and 19 (26%) of the 74 control infants, either a new intracranial hemorrhage developed or an already-present one became more extensive (p = 0.73). Similar numbers of infants had each grade of intracranial hemorrhage on both initial and follow-up ultrasonography. Similar numbers of infants received fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells, but treated infants received less of both. The bleeding time was prolonged in the treated group before the infusion of platelet concentrates but subsequently shortened (mean difference, 79.0; 95% confidence interval, 73.1 to 84.9). Subanalysis of the control group showed that infants with platelet counts < 60 x 10(9)/L (n = 21) on at least one occasion received more fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells than did those with platelet counts > 60 x 10(9)/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Five years (1995-1999) of surgical records were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were included if evacuation of an intracranial postoperative hematoma was reported. A control group was randomly selected. Forty-nine patients (0.8%) had postoperative hematomas requiring evacuation. The amount of intraoperative blood loss was significantly larger in the hematoma group (762 +/-735 mL [median 500 mL]) than in the control group (415 +/-403 mL; median 300 mL) (P = 0.004). Clinical deterioration occurred within the first 24 hours in 80%, within 6 hours in 51%, and within 1 hour in 12% of the patients. Those who deteriorated within 24 hours had a faster and more life-threatening deterioration than those who had a hematoma after 24 hours. A decreased level of consciousness was found in 61% and increased focal neurologic signs were found in 33% of the patients. An elevated intracranial pressure was seen significantly more often in the hematoma group (9/10 patients, 90%) than in the control group (1/8 patients, 12.5%) (P = 0.001). In this study, a large amount of intraoperative blood loss and elevated intracranial pressure were warning signs of postoperative hematoma and should alert the clinician to the increased risk. Most hematomas occurred within 24 hours after surgery, and in this time period the deterioration was more severe compared with the hematomas that occurred later."

Novo Nordisk recognizes the need to establish clinical guidance, and when possible, regulatory approvals for indications with bleeding episodes of various aetiologies. Currently, the safety and efficacy of rFVIIa is being investigated in 11 multinational, phase II trials, involving more than 1500 patients. Most of these trials have been designed to establish the efficacy of rFVIIa as a rescue treatment in episodes of severe life-threatening (upper gastrointestinal bleeding, stem cell transplantation, intra-cerebral haemorrhage and trauma). The remaining focus is on the prophylactic use of rFVIIa to improve haemostasis during surgery (orthotopic liver transplantation and liver resection), with the aim of avoiding or reducing the need for blood transfusions. In addition, Novo Nordisk is also continuing studies in haemophilia patients with inhibitors to increase therapeutic knowledge within this indication.

A therapeutic trial of iron has been used to differentiate between the two conditions, however, no previous study on its usefulness in a Thai population has been reported. Otherwise healthy persons who had complete blood count (CBC) as routine 'check-up' and found to be anemic (Hb < 12 g/dl) at a preventive medicine clinic were tested for hemoglobin typing, serum ferritin, serum iron, and were given oral iron sulfate (120 mg elemental iron per day for at least 2 months) and a repeat CBC on a follow-up visit. Sixty-six individuals, all females, with pre-treatment hemoglobin (Hb) level of 9.5 +/- 1.7 g/dl (mean +/- SD), had complete data for analysis. Final diagnoses were isolated iron deficiency in 23 (34.8%), iron deficient thalassemia traits in 6 (9.1%) and iron-sufficient thalassemia syndromes in 29 (43.9%) anemic subjects. After a therapeutic trial of iron, Hb rose to 12.8 +/- 1.0 g/dl (n = 16, p = 2 x 10(-8)) among the iron deficient group, but not in thalassemia. The authors have identified that the most useful red cell indices that will discriminate between iron deficiency and thalassemia is a combination of red blood cell counts (RBC) > 4.4 x 10(6)/microl and mean corpuscular volume (MCV) < 69 fl. High RBC (> 4.4 x 10(6)/microl) and very low MCV (< 69 fl) is a sensitive (92.9%) and highly specific (100%) criteria for diagnosis of mild thalassemia diseases (Hemoglobin H (HbH), Hemoglobin H-Constant Spring (HbH-CS), and homozygous Hemoglobin E (HbEE)). Conversely, a low RBC (> 4.4 x 10(6)/microl) and/or low to normal MCV (69-85 fl) is highly sensitive (91.3%) but not specific (60%) for the diagnosis of iron deficiency. The authors conclude that a therapeutic trial of iron is useful as a diagnostic test in anemic females except those with high RBC (> 4.4 x 10(6)/microl) and very low MCV (< 69 fl), a subgroup which most likely has thalassemia and are least likely to benefit from iron treatment."

Rh-positive patients with acute leukaemia undergoing induction chemotherapy and requiring platelet transfusions were allocated to weekly intravenous anti-D (20 micrograms/kg) or placebo. Platelets and red cell concentrates were administered according to standardized transfusion guidelines. Outcome measures included platelet transfusion utilization, red cell utilization, platelet recovery 18-24 h post-infusion, and the percentage of patients refractory to platelet transfusion. There were 43 patients studied: 21 received anti-D and 22 saline placebo.

Post-operative haemoglobin was higher in IOAT patients (IOAT 11.6 g/dl +/- 1.1 versus controls 11.2 g/dl +/- 0.98, P < 0.001). There is therefore the potential for a further reduction in homologous blood use in the IOAT group. There was no difference in early clinical outcome in the two groups; in particular the incidence of coagulopathies was not influenced by IOAT. The routine use of IOAT would add substantially to the cost of these operations. The decision to use it must therefore be based on an assessment of the value of the reduction in risk to the patient achieved by a small reduction in homologous donor exposures."

The primary endpoint of the study was the number of RBC units needed during SSCT. In addition, Hb levels and QOL were measured. The mean number of RBC units given in the epoetin beta arm was 4.5 compared to 8.3 in the control arm ( P=0.0134). The mean Hb levels during therapy were 10.4 g/dl in the epoetin beta arm and 9.7 g/dl in the control ( P=0.018). From baseline until BEAM therapy QOL (EORTC QLQ C30) and fatigue (MFI) assessment showed little QOL worsening or stable levels in both arms with a steeper increase of fatigue levels in the control group. Patients with relapsed lymphoma undergoing aggressive chemotherapy and stem cell support benefited from epoetin beta therapy, with a decrease of RBC transfusion requirements and lower rise of fatigue levels."

PK/PD data-including serum drug concentrations, reticulocyte counts, red blood cells, and hemoglobin levels-were obtained from 2 clinical studies. In sum, 149 healthy men received multiple intravenous or subcutaneous doses of HX575 (100 IU/kg) and the comparator 3 times a week for 4 weeks. A population model based on pharmacodynamics-mediated drug disposition and cell maturation processes was used to characterize the PK/PD data for the 2 drugs. Simulations showed that due to target amount changes, total clearance may increase up to 2.4-fold as compared with the baseline. Further simulations suggested that once-weekly and thrice-weekly subcutaneous dosing regimens would result in similar efficacy. The findings from the model-based analysis were consistent with previous results using the standard noncompartmental approach demonstrating PK/PD comparability between HX575 and comparator. However, due to complexity of the PK/PD model, control of random effects was not straightforward. Whereas population PK/PD model-based analyses are suited for studying complex biological systems, such models have their limitations (statistical), and their comparability results should be interpreted carefully."

To test the hypothesis that preoperative treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) with or without acute concomitant normovolaemic haemodilution (ANHD) is as effective as PDAB in reducing allogeneic blood transfusions, we conducted a prospective randomised study in women undergoing primary hip replacement.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty consecutive female patients scheduled for primary hip replacement and suitable for PDAB were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups.

The aim of our study was to investigate if RES had a clinically measurable cardioprotective effect in patients after myocardial infarction. In this double-blind, placebo controlled trial 40 post-infarction Caucasian patients were randomized into two groups. One group received 10 mg RES capsule daily for 3 months. Systolic and diastolic left ventricular function, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD), several laboratory and hemorheological parameters were measured before and after the treatment. Left ventricular ejection fraction showed an increasing tendency (ns) by RES treatment. However, left ventricular diastolic function was improved significantly (p < 0.01) by RES. A significant improvement in endothelial function measured by FMD was also observed (p < 0.05). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level significantly decreased (p < 0.05) in the RES treated group. Red blood cell deformability decreased and platelet aggregation increased significantly in the placebo group (p < 0.05), while resveratrol treatment has prevented these unfavourable changes. Concerning other measured parameters no significant changes were observed neither in placebo nor in RES group. Our results show that resveratrol improved left ventricle diastolic function, endothelial function, lowered LDL-cholesterol level and protected against unfavourable hemorheological changes measured in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD)."

            "abstract": "The transfusion of red blood cells is still associated with possible adverse effects and a residual risk of transmission of viral and nonviral diseases. In addition, there is an increasing shortage of blood supply worldwide. These two facts together with the success experienced in the treatment of various types of anemia with recombinant human EPO, have recently led to an increasing interest in the anemia of critically ill patients. As in the anemia of chronic diseases there are several reasons that contribute to the development of anemia in patients on intensive care units: pre-existing anemia, blood loss, reduced red cell life span, impaired iron availability and a direct inhibition of erythropoiesis by inflammatory cytokines. The implications of anemia for the progression and prognosis of critical illness are still unclear and the optimal treatment, including optimal \"transfusion triggers\" remains controversial. Recombinant human EPO has been proven to be effective in ameliorating the anemia of critical illness in several pilot studies and is currently being tested in larger trials."

            "abstract": "Carbohydrate-electrolyte (CE) feedings have been shown to improve endurance performance at moderate intensities (60-75% VO2max) and or more than 2 h duration. The effects of CE feedings during high intensity exercise (i.e. > or = 80% VO2 max) of shorter duration (approximately 1 h) are less clear. Therefore the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of the ingestion of a 7.6% CE solution during exercise on time trial cycling performance of approximately 1 h. This type of performance testing has been shown to be more reproducible (coefficient of variation 3.35%) than the traditional exercise test to exhaustion. On two occasions and in random order nineteen endurance trained cyclists completed an exercise test requiring the accomplishment of a set amount of work as fast as possible (time trial) under strictly standardized conditions. As the start and during the trials they drank in total 14 ml/kg of either a 7.6% CE solution or artificially flavored and colored water (placebo). Time to complete the set amount of work was significantly reduced and thus performance was significantly increase (p < 0.001) with the CE drink by 2.3%. Time to complete the set amount of work was 58.74 +/- 0.52 min with CE and 60.15 +/- 0.65 min with placebo (p < 0.001). Average workload during the time trials was 297.5 +/- 1.4W and 291.0 +/- 10.3 W, respectively. Subjects exercised at 76.4 +/- 0.7% of their maximal work rate (Wmax) with CE and at 74.8% Wmax with placebo (p < 0.001). It was concluded tht also in relative short term (1h) high intensity (75% Wmax) cycling exercise ingestion of a carbohydrate-electrolyte solution compared to placebo improves performance."

            "abstract": "A computer simulation study to produce ultrasonic backscatter coefficients (BSCs) from red blood cell (RBC) clusters is discussed. The simulation algorithm is suitable for generating non-overlapping, isotropic, and fairly identical RBC clusters. RBCs were stacked following the hexagonal close packing (HCP) structure to form a compact spherical aggregate. Such an aggregate was repeated and placed randomly under non-overlapping condition in the three-dimensional space to mimic an aggregated blood sample. BSCs were computed between 750 KHz and 200 MHz for samples of various cluster sizes at different hematocrits. Magnitudes of BSCs increased with mean aggregate sizes at low frequencies (<20 MHz). The accuracy of the structure-factor-size-estimator (SFSE) method in determining mean aggregate size and packing factor was also examined. A good correlation (R(2) ≥ 0.94) between the mean size of aggregates predicted by the SFSE and true size was found for each hematocrit. This study shows that for spherical aggregates there exists a region for each hematocrit where SFSE works most accurately. Typically, error of SFSE in estimating mean cluster size was <20% for dimensions between 14 and 17 μm at 40% hematocrit. This study suggests that the theoretical framework of SFSE is valid under the assumption of isotropic aggregates."

Eligibility criteria included failure to achieve a white blood cell (WBC) count > or = 100/microL by day +21 or > or = 300/microL by day +28, no absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > or = 200/microL by day +28, or secondary sustained neutropenia after initial engraftment.

For patients receiving GM-CSF alone, neutrophil recovery (ANC > or = 500/microL) occurred between 2 and 61 days (median, 8 days) after therapy, while those receiving GM-CSF+G-CSF recovered at a similar rate of 1 to 36 days (median, 6 days; P = .39).

Similarly, platelet transfusion independence was delayed until 4 to 249 days (median, 32 days) after enrollment, with no difference between the two treatment groups (GM-CSF: median, 28 days; GM-CSF+G-CSF: median, 42 days; P = .38). Recovery times were not different between patients with unrelated donors and those with related donors or autologous transplant recipients.

In those treated with tranexamic acid there was a significant reduction in the odds of fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events (odds ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.53 to 0.89; P=0.005) and a significant reduction in arterial thrombotic events (0.58, 0.40 to 0.83; P=0.003) but no significant reduction in venous thrombotic events (0.83, 0.59 to 1.17; P=0.295). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thrombotic events (P=0.74). If the effect of tranexamic acid is assumed to be the same in all risk strata (<6%, 6-20%, 21-50%, >50% risk of death at baseline), the percentage of deaths that could be averted by administration of tranexamic acid within three hours of injury in each group is 17%, 36%, 30%, and 17%, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Tranexamic acid can be administered safely to a wide spectrum of patients with traumatic bleeding and should not be restricted to the most severely injured.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ISRCTN86750102."

            "abstract": "Postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is often administered intravenously, despite an increased morbidity rate compared with oral application. This study investigates whether a postoperative oral antibiotic regimen is as effective as incorporation of intravenous antibiotics after bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. 42 patients who underwent bimaxillary orthognathic surgery between December 2008 and May 2010 were randomly allocated to 2 placebo-controlled postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis groups. Group 1 received oral amoxicillin 500mg three times daily; group 2 received intravenous ampicillin 1g four times daily, during the first two postoperative days. Both groups subsequently took oral amoxicillin for three more days. Clinically, the infection rate was assessed in both study groups for a period of 6 weeks after the surgery. 9 patients (21.4%) developed infection. No adverse drug event was detected. No significant difference (p=0.45) was detected in the infection rate between group 1 (3/21) and group 2 (6/21). Age, type of surgical procedures, duration of the operative procedure, surgical procedure-related events, blood loss, and blood transfusion were all found not related to infection (p>0.05). Administration of more cost-effective oral antibiotic prophylaxis, which causes less comorbidity, can be considered to be safe in bimaxillary orthognathic surgery with segmentalizations."

Demographic, medical, surgical, laboratory, mediastinal chest tube drainage (MCTD), hemoglobin loss, transfusion, and outcome data were collected. Allogenic blood product administration was tightly controlled. The demographic, medical, and surgical characteristics were similar in all three groups. The median postoperative MCTD and hemoglobin loss in the pre-CPB TA group (710 mL, 8.6 g) was significantly less (P < 0.001) compared with the control (1202 mL, 44.2 g) and post-CPB TA groups (1020 mL, 23.4 g). The percentage of patients who received no allogenic blood products was 27% for the pre-CPB TA group and 33% for the post-CPB TA group (not significant). These percentages were significantly lower than those in the placebo group (66%, P < 0.001). The median number of allogenic blood products administered to the pre-CPB TA group (0 units) was significantly less compared with the control group (4.5 units). The thromboelastogram and fibrinogen split product levels in the pre-CPB TA group indicated better platelet function and less activation of the fibrinolytic system compared with the other two groups (P < 0.05). There were no intergroup differences in reoperation, myocardial infarction, stroke, infections, or death.

Priming of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit with patients' own blood [retrograde autologous priming (RAP)] is a technique used to limit haemodilution and reduce transfusion requirements. We designed this study to evaluate the effects of RAP on reducing perioperative blood transfusion in small adults.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and twenty patients with a body surface area of less than 1.5 m undergoing first-time, nonemergency cardiac surgery were randomized to either the standard priming group or the RAP group.

Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs, filtration of RBCs appears rational, but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors, both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration."

Although prophylaxis is effective in reducing bleeding and joint damage in children, whether it is necessary to continue into adulthood is not known. The purpose of this article is to describe a Phase III randomized controlled trial to evaluate prophylaxis comparing two dose regimens in adults with severe hemophilia A. I hypothesize that adults with mature cartilage and joints are less susceptible to joint bleeds and joint damage, and that once-weekly recombinant factor VIII prophylaxis, with up to two rescue doses per week, is as effective as thrice-weekly prophylaxis in reducing bleeding frequency, but less costly and more acceptable, with higher quality of life. The ultimate goal of this project is to determine whether once-weekly prophylaxis is any worse than thrice-weekly prophylaxis in reducing joint bleeding frequency, while potentially utilizing less factor, at lower cost, leading to a better quality of life. This is an innovative concept, as it challenges the current paradigm of thrice-weekly prophylaxis in adults, which is based on dosing in children. Furthermore, this trial will assess interdose thrombin generation, a novel tissue factor-based assay of hemostasis, to determine if individualized thrombin generation can predict more individualized prophylaxis dosing, which would be practice changing."

            "abstract": "To test the safety and efficacy of tirilazad mesylate, a nonglucocorticoid 21-aminosteroid, in improving the outcome of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 902 patients were enrolled in a prospective randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial at 54 North American neurosurgical centers. Five patients were excluded prior to receiving any study drug. Of 897 patients who received at least one dose of study medication, 300 received a placebo containing a citrate vehicle, 298 received 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad, and 299 received 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad, all administered intravenously beginning within 48 hours of the SAH and continuing through 10 days posthemorrhage. All patients were also treated with orally administered nimodipine. At 3 months post-SAH, there were no significant differences (p < 0.025) among the groups with regard to mortality rate, favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, or employment status. During the first 14 days after the SAH, there were no significant differences among the groups in the incidence or severity of clinically symptomatic or angiographically identifiable cerebral vasospasm. Mortality data stratified by gender and neurological grade on admission (assessed according to a modified World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scale) demonstrated that the men with Grades IV to V had a 33% mortality rate in the vehicle group, 52% in the 2 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.29), and 5% in the 6 mg/kg per day tirilazad group (p = 0.03). Tirilazad was well tolerated at both dose levels. Tirilazad mesylate at dosage levels of up to 6 mg/kg per day for 8 to 10 days following SAH did not improve the overall outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH in this trial. The differences in the efficacy of tirilazad in this trial and a previously reported trial in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, in which dosage levels of tirilazad of 6 mg/kg per day reduced mortality rates and increased good recovery, may be a result of differences in admission characteristics of the patients and/or differences in management protocols, including the use of anticonvulsant medications."

            "abstract": "Stroke is generally uncommon in children, but sickle cell disease is associated with a high risk of stroke in the early years of childhood. Large cerebral arteries, especially the middle cerebral and intracranial internal carotid, develop stenosis that predisposes to ischemic stroke. Noninvasive prediction of risk using transcranial Doppler ultrasonography made it possible to test primary stroke prevention in a clinical trial comparing chronic blood transfusion with standard care. A consortium of 14 clinical centers conducted a randomized clinical trial (Stroke Prevention in Sickle Cell Anemia--the \"STOP\" study) to test a strategy to prevent first stroke in children with sickle cell disease. Over 2000 children were screened with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and of these, 130 with elevated blood velocity indicating high risk were enrolled in the trial. Regular red cell transfusions sufficient to reduce the percentage of Hb S gene product from over 90 to less than 30 of total hemoglobin was associated with a marked reduction in stroke. The untreated risk of 10% per year was reduced over 90% with treatment, an effect sufficient to cause early termination of the trial. Although treatment was unblinded, the design included blinded adjudication of possible stroke by a panel of neurologists remote from the study sites. The study led to a Clinical Alert, issued by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, recommending screening and consideration of treatment in children with sickle cell disease and 2 to 16 years of age who are at risk based on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, and who have not had stroke."

The control group comprised patients entered in the trauma registry during the study period who did not have a diagnosis of adrenal hematoma.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Fifty-four adrenal hematomas were detected in 51 patients: 42 with right-gland, 12 with left-gland, and three with bilateral lesions. The hematomas were round or ovoid and had a mean maximum diameter of 2.8 cm +/- 0.7 (SD) and a mean attenuation of 52 HU +/- 12. Periadrenal stranding was seen with 48 (89%) hematomas. At follow-up CT, 32 of 35 hematomas had resolved or decreased in size and attenuation. One patient with adrenal hematoma had no other intraabdominal injuries. Compared with the 6,757 control patients, the 51 patients with adrenal hematoma had a higher mortality rate (10% vs 4%; P <.001, chi(2) test) and a higher mean ISS (25.2 vs 9.7; P <.01, t test). Adrenal hematoma was found in 24 (0.4%) of 5,665 trauma patients with an ISS of 0-19, as compared with six (5.0%) of 122 patients with an ISS of 40 or higher.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Adrenal hematoma was detected in 51 (1.9%) of 2,692 trauma patients who underwent CT, or 0.8% of all patients (n = 6,808) entered in the trauma registry.

The intervention is blood transfusion versus observation. Two hundred and four participants (102 in each treatment assignment) will ensure 85% power to detect the effect necessary to recommend transfusion therapy (86% reduction), after accounting for 10% drop out and 19% crossover rates. MRI examination of the brain is done at screening, immediately before randomization and study exit. Each randomly assigned participant receives a cognitive test battery at study entry, 12-18 months later, and study exit and an annual neurological examination.

In a prospective randomized trial, the authors evaluated the ability of DDAVP to reduce perioperative bleeding during uncomplicated coronary bypass operations. Sixty-two patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to receive intraoperatively either a placebo or DDAVP. Both groups were similar with respect to operative characteristics and preoperative hematologic profiles, von Willebrand factor levels increased postoperatively in both placebo (2.77 +/- 1.06 versus 2.17 +/- 1.51 U) and DDAVP groups (2.75 +/- 0.94 versus 1.80 +/- 0.88 U). Only the increase in the DDAVP groups was significant (p less than 0.001). There was no difference in total blood loss between the placebo (1826 +/- 849 ml) and DDAVP groups (1716 +/- 688 ml). Total red cell transfusions were similar in placebo (3.4 +/- 1.3 units of blood) and DDAVP groups (3.6 +/- 0.8 units). These results do not support the intraoperative use of DDAVP to reduce perioperative bleeding in routine coronary artery bypass surgery."

            "title": "Human haemoglobin - Northfield.",
            "abstract": "PolyHeme is a chemically modified haemoglobin solution derived from human blood. It has been developed by Northfield Laboratories as an alternative to transfused blood for the treatment of acute blood loss (such as in trauma or surgery). Single molecules of haemoglobin are toxic to the kidneys and cause vasoconstriction. The haemoglobin molecules in PolyHeme are polymerised to create small chains of linked tetramers. In August 2001, Northfield Laboratories stated that it had submitted a Biologics Licence Application (BLA) to the US FDA for approval of PolyHeme as a blood substitute for use in the treatment of urgent, life-threatening blood loss. There were some undisclosed problems with the BLA, and the US FDA asked for more information before it would accept the application or allow the company to conduct a trial for this indication. In March 2003, Northfield Laboratories announced that it had received clearance from the US FDA to proceed with a pivotal phase III trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of PolyHeme in improving patient survival when used to treat severely injured and bleeding trauma patients at the scene of injury and during ambulance transport to the hospital. Because of the severity of patients' injuries, this trial will be conducted under federal regulations that allow clinical research in emergency settings without obtaining informed consent. This trial will be conducted in urban settings where transit times to hospital may be short and not long enough to demonstrate superiority to the control group, therefore dual primary endpoints of superiority and non-inferiority will be evaluated. Northfield Laboratories has initiated a public disclosure and community consultation process; because informed consent will not be possible, this is one of the US FDA requirements that must be met prior to initiating the trial. In June 2003, Northfield Laboratories reached an agreement with the US FDA on Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the trial. The SPA is an acknowledgment and agreement between the trial sponsor and the US FDA for successful completion of the proposed trial to form the primary basis for an efficacy claim. In October 2002, Northfield Laboratories announced that it was collaborating with the US Army in developing a treatment Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for the battlefield use of PolyHeme. The IND is being developed to gain authorisation for the use of PolyHeme in patients in shock in remote battlefield settings, where red blood cells are not available. Phase III trials in the UK, Germany and Sweden are underway with Pharmacia Corporation (now Pfizer), who has licenced PolyHeme in these countries. On 16 April 2003, Pharmacia Corporation was acquired by, and merged into, Pfizer. Northfield Laboratories' US phase III trials have focused on elective surgery indications while the European trials are focusing on surgery with acute trauma patients where large amounts of blood are lost. Up to 20 units of PolyHeme have been infused in US trials in trauma patients. This volume represents 200% of an average person's blood volume. Northfield Laboratories has estimated that of the approximately 14 million units of blood which were used for transfusions in the US in 2001, about 8.5 million units were for acute blood loss, for which patient charges amounted to an estimated $US2.5 billion. The US transfusion market consists of two principal segments: the acute blood loss segment, which accounts for about 60% of the total market according to Northfield Laboratories, and the chronic blood loss segment, accounting for the remaining 40%. The former includes transfusions in connection with trauma, surgery and unexpected blood loss, while the latter includes transfusions used in general medical applications and chronic anaemias. Northfield Laboratories believes that PolyHeme's largest potential is in the elective surgery market, at the time estimated to use approximately 6.5 million units of blood in the US annually.Earlier, on 7 March 2003, the newswires quoted er, on 7 March 2003, the newswires quoted the CEO of Northfield Laboratories, stating that it is to administer 10 000 units of PolyHeme to 20 US trauma centres, following US FDA approval of a third phase III trial. Pending market approval of PolyHeme, the company will initially produce 75 000 units of the product, but expects this to increase to 400 000 units annually. Wall Street analysts have estimated the market potential for a substitute blood product to be in the \"multibillion-dollar\" range, according to the CEO. However, launch of PolyHeme was at the time said to be \"a couple of years away\"."

Tranexamic acid significantly reduced all-cause mortality. Because tranexamic acid is thought to exert its effect through inhibition of fibrinolysis, we undertook exploratory analyses of its effect on death due to bleeding.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The CRASH-2 trial was undertaken in 274 hospitals in 40 countries. 20,211 adult trauma patients with, or at risk of, significant bleeding were randomly assigned within 8 h of injury to either tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min followed by infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or placebo. Patients were randomly assigned by selection of the lowest numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight numbered packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial coordinating centre staff ) were masked to treatment allocation. We examined the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding according to time to treatment, severity of haemorrhage as assessed by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow coma score (GCS), and type of injury. All analyses were by intention to treat. The trial is registered as ISRCTN86750102, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00375258, and South African Clinical Trial Register/Department of Health DOH-27-0607-1919.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      10,096 patients were allocated to tranexamic acid and 10,115 to placebo, of whom 10,060 and 10,067, respectively, were analysed. 1063 deaths (35%) were due to bleeding. We recorded strong evidence that the effect of tranexamic acid on death due to bleeding varied according to the time from injury to treatment (test for interaction p<0.0001). Early treatment (≤1 h from injury) significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding (198/3747 [5.3%] events in tranexamic acid group vs 286/3704 [7.7%] in placebo group; relative risk [RR] 0.68, 95% CI 0.57-0.82; p<0.0001).

Evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy may be safe for most patients. However, concern has been raised over the risks of anaemia in those with ischaemic cardiac disease. Perioperative silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) has a relatively high incidence in the elderly population undergoing elective surgery. This study used Holter monitoring to compare the effect of a restrictive and a liberal red cell transfusion strategy on the incidence of SMI in patients without signs or symptoms of ischaemic heart disease who were undergoing lower limb arthroplasty.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a multicentre, controlled trial in which 260 patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery were enrolled and randomized to transfusion triggers that were either restrictive (8 g/dl) or liberal (10 g/dl). Participants were monitored with continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) (Holter monitoring), preoperatively for 12 h and postoperatively for 72 h. The tapes were analysed for new ischaemia by technicians blinded to treatment. The total ischaemia time in minutes was divided by the recording time in hours and an ischaemic load in min/h was calculated. Haemoglobin levels were measured preoperatively, postoperatively in the recovery room, and on days one, three and five after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean postoperative haemoglobin concentration was 9.87 g/dl in the restrictive group and 11.09 g/dl in the liberal group. In the restrictive group, 34% were transfused a total of 89 red cell units, and in the liberal group 43% were given a total of 119 red cell units. A postoperative episode of silent ischaemia was experienced by 21/109 (19%) patients in the restrictive group and by 26/109 (24%) patients in the liberal group [mean difference -4.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -15.5% to 6%, P = 0.41). There was no significant difference (P = 0.53) between the overall ischaemic load in the restrictive group (median 0 min/h, range 0-4.18) and the liberal group (median 0 min/h, range 0-19.48). In those patients who did experience postoperative SMI, the mean ischaemic load was 0.48 min/h in the restrictive group and 1.51 min/h in the liberal group (ratio 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.76, P = 0.011). The median postoperative length of hospital stay in the restrictive group was 7.3 days [range 5-11; interquartile range (IQR) 6-8] compared with 7.5 days (range 5-13; IQR 7-8) in the liberal group. The numbers were not large enough to conclude equivalence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In patients without preoperative evidence of myocardial ischaemia undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery, a restrictive transfusion strategy seems unlikely to be associated with an increased incidence of SMI. A proportion of these patients experience moderate SMI, regardless of the transfusion trigger. Use of a restrictive transfusion strategy did not increase length of hospital stay, and use of this strategy would lead to a significant reduction in red cell transfusion in orthopaedic surgery. Our data did not indicate any potential for harm in employing such a strategy in patients with no prior evidence of cardiac ischaemia who were undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery."

Patients included in the second group were treated by short term sclerotherapy only if a variceal rebleeding was present. The overall cumulative proportion of patients rebleeding was not significantly different in either group. Combined sclerotherapy patients, however, experienced less episodes of variceal haemorrhage and the source of haemorrhage was different (p < 0.002). Combined sclerotherapy was more efficient in preventing bleeding from oesophageal bleeding points but not those arising from a junctional source (p < 0.05). A greater incidence of oesophageal rebleeding was found in those patients whose first source of bleeding was oesophageal (p < 0.05). No significant difference was detected in survival expectancy between either group.

There were significant decreases in serum ferritin (initial mean +/- standard deviation 2168 +/- 1142, final 418 +/- 247 micro g/l; t-test for paired samples, P = 0.005), hepatic iron (initial 20.3 +/- 6.26, final 11.7 +/- 4.83 mg/g/dry weight; P = < 0.02), red cell membrane iron (initial 76.2 +/- 3.64, final 7.2 +/- 0.56 mmol/mg protein; P = < 0.0005) and serum non-transferrin bound iron (initial 9.0 +/- 0.56, final 5.9 +/- 0.89 micro mol/l; P = < 0.0005). There was also a significant rise in serum erythropoietin (initial 240 +/- 195.1, final 433.2 +/- 269.2 U/l; P = 0.034). The haemoglobin level rose in three patients and transfusion requirements were reduced substantially in four patients. Serum thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) also fell in six of eight patients. Patients generally improved clinically, with weight gain observed. Side-effects were mild and included gastrointestinal symptoms (6) and arthralgia (1), not requiring withdrawal of the drug. One patient died at 17 weeks of therapy as a result of an intercurrent infection. His neutrophil count was normal. We conclude that deferiprone is an effective, well-tolerated iron chelator for patients with thalassaemia intermedia. Further studies are needed to determine the optimum dose and length of treatment needed to reduce iron burden to a safe level in these patients."

In more than 90% of all procedures wound drainage is used. It remains to be proven whether suction drainage actually is superior to gravity drainage in everyday use. In a random study with 200 patients it was proven that suction drainage shows no significant advantage in liquid quantum, haematoma and the frequency of complications. We conclude that the economically favourable gravity drainage can replace the more expensive suction drainage in most cases."

Experimental and clinical data implicate inadequate erythropoietin production as an important reason. In this study recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEpo) was used in an attempt to treat or prevent this anaemia and thereby provide an alternative to erythrocyte transfusions. Premature infants (birth weight < or = 1250 g and gestational age < or = 32 weeks), who were likely to need transfusions, were randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of treatment with either subcutaneously administered r-HuEpo (200 U; n = 12) or placebo (n = 12), three times weekly. All patients had oral supplements of elemental iron at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day. Treatment was started in the third week of life. Reticulocyte counts were significantly raised (P < 0.05) in the group treated with r-HuEpo at the end of treatment. The neonates in the group treated with r-HuEpo needed fewer erythrocyte transfusions than those in the placebo group during treatment. There were no toxic effects attributable to r-HuEpo. The results indicate that treatment of infants with very low birth weights with r-HuEpo will reduce their need for erythrocyte transfusions."

Sixty episodes of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage were evaluated during a 40-month period; 32 received conventional and 28 conventional plus vasopressin therapy.

Vasopressin was more effective in controlling hemorrhage from nonvariceal lesions (P less than 0.05) and from varices (P less than 0.01) than conventional therapy. Transfusion requirements were significantly reduced in those patients who received vasopressin. Paradoxically, survival was not affected by vasopressin administration. The failure of cessation of hemorrhage to improve survival is thought to be due to the degree of advancement of the underlying disease, to the torrential nature of the hemorrhage, to the frequency of recurrent hemorrhage, and to the use of intraarterial vasopressin in some patients in the conventional treatment group in whom conventional therapy had failed."

These differences were highly significant in favor of emergency portacaval shunt (all p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Emergency portacaval shunt was strikingly superior to endoscopic sclerotherapy as well as to the combination of endoscopic sclerotherapy and rescue portacaval shunt in regard to all outcome measures, specifically bleeding control, survival, incidence of portal-systemic encephalopathy, improvement in liver function, quality of life, and cost of care. These results strongly support the use of emergency portacaval shunt as the first line of emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in cirrhosis."

After a 1-week placebo washout period, patients were administered either 0.05 mg or 0.10 mg of procaterol or placebo twice daily for 2 wk. Spirometric determinations, vital signs, and ECGs were obtained at 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hr after the first dose and at the same time intervals after 1 and 2 wk of treatment. Patients recorded on a daily basis peak flow rates, asthma symptoms, need for supplemental aerosol, concurrent medications, and side effects. Spirometry results indicated significant improvement in pulmonary function with both doses of procaterol compared with placebo (P less than 0.05). The larger dose was generally more effective. Bronchodilatation was evident 1/2 hr after dosing and peaked at 2 hr. At 8 hr after 0.10 mg of procaterol, FEV1 was still above predose values. Daily peak flow rates were significantly higher with 0.10 mg than with 0.05 mg (P less than 0.05) and placebo (P less than 0.001). Tremor and nervousness were the most frequent side effects. They occurred in a dose-related frequency, were mild and transient, and occurred early in treatment. No significant drug-related changes were noted in ECGs, heart rate, blood pressure, or clinical laboratory data. Procaterol was found to be an effective, well-tolerated oral bronchodilator with a long duration of action, especially at 0.10 mg twice daily."

The subjects were studied during normal, suppressed or stimulated erythropoiesis induced by hypertransfusion and phlebotomy, respectively. The production of 14CO was calculated from determinations of the specific activity of the body CO store and the endogenous production of CO. The incorporation of labelled glycine into circulating red cell haemo;globin haem was calculated from the maximal specific activity of haemoglobin haem and the total amount of Hb. The average ELP was 73.0 X 10(3) disintegrations per min (dpm) and the incorportion of glycine into circulating haemoglobin haem 491 X 10(3) dpm in controls. The ELP and the incorporation of glycine increased by 86% and 92%, respectively, in phlebotomized subjects and decreased by 37% and 62%, respectively, in hypertransfused subjects. A linear regression equation was calculated for the relationship between ELP and erythropoiesis, expressed as the incorportion of glycine into circulating haemoglobin haem. The residual ELP remaining in the absence of erythropoiesis was 24.9 X 10(3) dpm calculated from data of all the subjects, and 32.8 X 10(3) dpm calculated from data of controls and hypertransfused subjects only. In conclusion, erythropoietic haem turnover was found to contribute about 60% and nonerythropoietic (mainly hepatic) haem turnover about 40% of the ELP in man."

Mean red cell volume and mean red cell hemoglobin were significantly elevated in alcoholic as compared with nonalcoholic patients (p less than 0.001), with a sensitivity of 40 and 51 percent, respectively. The ability of an elevated mean red cell volume and mean red cell hemoglobin to exclude active alcoholism (specificity) was 86 and 76 percent, respectively. Development of excessive consumption of alcohol during the course of the study was not associated with significant elevations over baseline values of either mean red cell volume or mean red cell hemoglobin. Similarly, the mean red cell volume and mean red cell hemoglobin in the small number of patients whose consumption of alcohol markedly decreased did not significantly change from baseline values. These findings suggest that although the specificity of mean red cell volume may be helpful in eliminating those persons who are not actively alcoholic, its sensitivity does not permit its use as a biologic marker for alcoholism. The inclusion of an elevated mean red cell volume as a major criterion for the diagnosis of alcoholism should be reconsidered."

The assay is based on the ability of solubilized, infected red blood cells (RBC) (P. falciparum \"antigen\") to combine with anti-P. falciparum antibodies and thus prevent the subsequent interaction of the latter with \"antigen\"-coated microtiter plates. A preliminary trial was carried out in Thailand to determine the usefulness of the RIA for the immunodiagnosis of malaria. Blood samples from malarious and non-malarious patients were examined both by standard microscopy and by RIA. Efficient solubilization of the parasites proved to be a major requirement for the successful performance of the RIA. Sonication or freezing and thawing, which were perfectly satisfactory for the solubilization of cultured, infected RBC, were found to be totally inadequate when applied to RBC taken from patients. However, parasites in RBC from patients could be solubilized efficiently by treatment with detergents (e.g., NP40, Triton X-100, etc.). Of the 108 blood samples tested, 23 were found positive for falciparum parasitemia by microscopy and 39 by RIA. One sample from a patient with patent falciparum parasitemia and three with patent vivax parasitemia were negative by RIA. Ten of the samples positive only by RIA belonged to patients with recent malarial infection, as shown by microscopy. Thus, the RIA detected almost all of the patients with microscopic evidence of falciparum malaria. The proportion of false positives in the RIA test was low."

The Hb followed an expected pattern, with a decreased concentration after PAD in the autologous group, then in both groups after surgery. The sEPO concentration was significantly higher in the allogeneic than in the autologous group on day one and day 4-5 postoperatively. The reticulocyte level, on the contrary, was higher in the autologous patients before, one hour after, and one day after surgery.

The current study evaluated this technique in patients undergoing repeat cardiac operations. Fifty-two patients undergoing repeat myocardial revascularization and/or valve replacement were evaluated in a prospective randomized controlled study design. Autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was harvested after the induction of anesthesia in the experimental group. After reversal of heparin, each patient received his or her autologous plasma. Patients in the control group did not have plasmapheresis and received standard transfusion therapy if coagulation variables were abnormal and a coagulopathy was clinically evident. Routine coagulation tests, thromboelastography (TEG), perioperative bleeding, and transfusion requirements were compared in the two groups. Forty-four patients completed the study. A significantly larger volume of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) was transfused in the PRP group than in the control group (P = 0.03). Platelet and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions did not differ between the two groups. Mediastinal tube drainage did not differ between the two groups. During PRP infusion, 60% of the patients required treatment for moderate hypotension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] < 60 mm Hg). Only 16% of control patients required treatment for hypotension during the comparable time period (P < 0.05). No patient who completed the study returned to the operating room for postoperative bleeding. These data suggest that PRP did not reduce postbypass bleeding or transfusion requirements in repeat cardiac surgical patients. Moreover, the incidence of hypotension during PRP reinfusion introduces a potential risk to the procedure in the absence of any obvious benefit."

We have conducted a prospective randomized and controlled trial in 60 patients with acute digestive hemorrhage without haemodynamic failure. We realized two groups: 1) control group: the target of transfusion in these patients was the hematocrit value of > or = 28%. 2) treatment group: these patients were supported with normovolemic haemodilution with crystalloid solutions until a hematocrit value of 21%. All patients have endoscopic diagnosis and they went evaluated across the study with clinic and laboratory controls. Both groups were significative differences in the hematocrit value. We did not see differences between the groups in the hospital stay neither the rate of organs failure. We find difference between the groups in the amount of red cell units (0.61 +/- 0.87 vs. 2.14 +/- 1.10; treatment and control respectively, P < 0.001). The APACHE score was greater in the treatment group. This supports that the oldest patients, who probably have least physiologic reserve, could be treated without complications.

Continuous ECG monitoring, performed after enrollment up to 96 hours, was analyzed by an automated algorithm and reviewed by a blinded cardiologist. We centrally adjudicated all bleeding and clinical events in a blinded fashion and calculated the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score (a validated predictor of mortality) for each patient.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 746 patients enrolled, 34 (4.6%) developed major bleeding within 96 hours.

Overall, 619 patients survived the first 96 hours with complete data on continuous ECG monitoring. Bleeding was associated with the simultaneous presence of ST-segment shifts on continuous ECG monitoring (P = .03). After adjusting for Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events risk score and myocardial ischemia detected by continuous ECG monitoring, major bleeding remained an independent predictor of death (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.48, 95% confidence interval 1.51-8.03, P = .003) and death/myocardial infarction (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.85, 95% confidence interval 1.40-5.78, P = .004).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bleeding is a powerful independent predictor of poor long-term outcome, even after adjusting for other associated prognostic factors such as advanced age and renal dysfunction.

This systematic review evaluated studies that compared TXA to placebo in children undergoing cardiac surgery. A systematic search was conducted in all relevant randomized controlled trials. The following information was extracted from the studies and analysed if relevant: demographic data, TXA dose and regimen of administration, cardiopulmonary bypass time, blood loss and blood product transfusion at 24 h. From the studies screened, only 8 (848 patients) were included in the analysis. Most data were heterogeneously distributed and could not be analysed. Further, transfusion policies were not well defined for each study. TXA reduced the need for red blood cell transfusion by 6.4 ml kg(-1) day(-1) (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.45), platelet transfusion by 3.7 ml kg(-1) day(-1) (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.46) and fresh frozen plasma transfusion by 5.4 ml kg(-1) day(-1) (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.53). The number of children who avoided all blood product transfusions was not reported in most of the studies. Evaluation of the side effects associated with TXA use and the effects of the agent on postoperative morbidity and mortality was not possible from the data. There was marked variability in the dosage and infusion schemes used in different studies. This systematic review showed that in paediatric cardiac surgery, the benefit-to-risk ratio associated with the use of TXA cannot be adequately defined. Evidence supporting the routine use of TXA in paediatric cardiac surgery remains weak."

The primary outcome was the combined endpoint of all thromboembolic events requiring hospitalisation and all major bleeding complications. Mean follow-up was 2.9 +/- 1.2 and 3.0 +/- 1.1 years in the SMG and RCG, respectively. In intention-to-treat analysis, 12 patients in the SMG versus 22 patients in the RCG reached a primary endpoint (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25 to 1.00; p = 0.049). The post-hoc analysis on OAC treatment sensitivity supported the benefit of self-management (HR 0.27; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.71; p = 0.006). Fifteen patients in the SMG died during the study, but none of the deaths was directly associated with anticoagulation therapy. In the RCG, 11 patients died; of those, three deaths were directly associated with anticoagulation therapy and there was one death of unknown cause. During follow-up, the quality of OAC control was significantly better in the SMG than in the RCG. In elderly patients, long-term self-management of oral anticoagulation is superior for the prevention of major thromboembolic and bleeding complications and for the quality of oral anticoagulation control compared to routine care for a mean follow-up period of three years."

This clinical trial enrolled 416 patients with AML aged 65 years or older who were considered eligible for standard intensive chemotherapy, with a first randomization comparing idarubicin with daunorubicin for all treatment sequences. After induction, an ambulatory postremission strategy based on 6 consolidation cycles administered monthly in outpatients was randomly compared with an intensive strategy with a single intensive consolidation course similar to induction. Complete remission (CR) rate was 57% with 10% induction deaths, and estimated overall survival was 27% at 2 years and 12% at 4 years, without notable differences between anthracycline arms. Among the 236 patients who reached CR, 164 (69%) were randomized for the postremission comparison. In these patients, the multivariate odds ratio in favor of the ambulatory arm was 1.51 for disease-free survival (P.05) and 1.59 for overall survival from CR (P.04). Despite repeated courses of chemotherapy associated with a longer time under treatment, the ambulatory arm was associated with significantly shorter rehospitalization duration and lower red blood cell unit and platelet transfusion requirements than observed in the intensive arm. In conclusion, more prolonged ambulatory treatment should be preferred to intensive chemotherapy as postremission therapy in elderly patients with AML reaching CR after standard intensive remission induction."

If these measures are insufficient to control the blood sugar, oral agents (sulphonylureas or biguanides) or insulin are added to the therapeutic regimen. Although the diet prescription has undergone some changes and refinements, this approach has been the traditional treatment for NIDDM for nearly 40 years. Recently a new class of oral agents, the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, has become available. These drugs are competitive inhibitors of the alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the bowel wall. They act to slow and delay the rate of carbohydrate absorption, thereby decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia. A recent study was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of acarbose, an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, in improving the glycemic control of patients with NIDDM who were sub-optimally controlled on either diet alone, or diet plus sulphonylurea, metformin or insulin. A total of 354 patients with NIDDM were studied, 77 on diet alone, 83 on metformin, 103 and sulphonylurea and 91 on insulin. Subjects in each treatment stratum were randomized, double-blind to either acarbose or placebo, for 1 year. At baseline and every 3 months thereafter, fasting and postprandial glucose and C-peptide, HbA1c and fasting lipids were measured. Compared to placebo, acarbose treatment resulted in a decrease in mean postprandial glucose in all four strata (19 +/- 0.8 to 15.3 +/- 0.7 mmol/l: P < 0.001).

All treatments were well tolerated, and adverse events were similar in frequency across treatment groups. No cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis were observed. In conclusion, treatment with rosuvastatin and atorvastatin produced beneficial lipid changes in this group of Hispanic patients that appear comparable in magnitude to those observed in primarily non-Hispanic white study populations.

We also studied the overall distribution of disability scores on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and the Barthel index.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We treated 300 patients with NXY-059 and 303 with placebo. Treatment groups were well matched for prognostic variables including Glasgow Coma Scale, risk factors, and age. The mean National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score on admission was 14 in both groups. The baseline hemorrhage volume was 22.4+/-20.1 mL in the NXY-059 group and 23.3+/-22.8 mL in the placebo group (mean+/-SD). Most hemorrhages were related to hypertension or anticoagulant use. Mortality was similar in both groups: 20.3% for NXY-059 and 19.8% for placebo-treated patients. The proportion of patients who experienced an adverse event was the same for both groups, whereas for serious adverse events the proportion was slightly higher in the NXY-059 group. However, no pattern emerged to indicate a safety concern. Serum potassium fell transiently in both groups, lower in the NXY-059 group. There were no differences in 3-month function, disability, or neurological deficit scores. The odds ratio for an improved outcome in 3-month mRS scores in the NXY-059 group was 1.01 (95% CI 0.75, 1.35).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      NXY-059 given within 6 hours of acute ICH has a good safety and tolerability profile, with no adverse effect on important clinical outcomes."

Patients were randomly assigned to receive, or not to receive, prophylactic platelet transfusions when morning platelet counts were less than 10×10(9) per liter. Eligible patients were persons 16 years of age or older who were receiving chemotherapy or undergoing stem-cell transplantation and who had or were expected to have thrombocytopenia. The primary end point was bleeding of World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2, 3, or 4 up to 30 days after randomization.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 600 patients (301 in the no-prophylaxis group and 299 in the prophylaxis group) underwent randomization between 2006 and 2011.

Patients in the no-prophylaxis group had more days with bleeding and a shorter time to the first bleeding episode than did patients in the prophylaxis group. Platelet use was markedly reduced in the no-prophylaxis group. A prespecified subgroup analysis identified similar rates of bleeding in the two study groups among patients undergoing autologous stem-cell transplantation.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of our study support the need for the continued use of prophylaxis with platelet transfusion and show the benefit of such prophylaxis for reducing bleeding, as compared with no prophylaxis.

            "abstract": "Although laboratory coagulation tests permit a rational approach to both diagnosis and management of coagulation disorders after cardiopulmonary bypass, their clinical utility is limited by delays in obtaining results. This study was designed to evaluate prospectively the impact of on-site coagulation testing on blood product use, operative time, and intraoperative management of microvascular bleeding. Patients who underwent cardiac procedures involving cardiopulmonary bypass and subsequently developed microvascular bleeding were randomly assigned to receive either standard therapy (n = 36) or therapy defined by a treatment algorithm based on results from an on-site coagulation monitoring laboratory (n = 30). No differences were found between treatment groups in hematologic assay data, operative procedures, or duration of cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients treated in accordance with on-site laboratory results (algorithm therapy) received significantly less intraoperative fresh frozen plasma (0.4 +/- 1.1 U versus 2.4 +/- 2.8 U; p = 0.0006) during the treatment interval, had shorter operative times, and had less mediastinal chest tube drainage during the initial perioperative interval (158 +/- 169 ml versus 326 +/- 258 ml; p = 0.003) than did patients in the standard therapy group. Patients who underwent algorithm therapy also received fewer platelet (1.6 +/- 5.9 versus 6.4 +/- 8.2 U; p = 0.02) and red blood cell (1.9 +/- 1.7 U versus 4.1 +/- 4.1 U; p = 0.01) transfusions after the operation. Nine of 36 (25%) standard group patients received initial therapy which differed from that which would have been guided by the on-site algorithm protocol. Our findings indicate that rapid and accurate coagulation test results can guide specific therapy and optimize treatment of microvascular bleeding in patients who undergo cardiac operations."

            "abstract": "The anemia of critical illness is a distinct clinical entity with characteristics similar to that of chronic disease anemia. Several solutions to the processes of anemia, such as blunted erythropoietin production and erythropoietin response and abnormalities in iron metabolism have been developed. The transfusion of RBCs provides immediate correction of low hemoglobin levels, which may be of value in patients with life-threatening anemia. Avoidance of RBC and blood component transfusion, however, is becoming increasingly important as data of adverse clinical outcomes in critically ill patients become clearer. Although the optimal hemoglobin in critically ill patients is not determined, this organ system has a generous reserve. Short-term compensated anemia is tolerated well, while exogenous erythropoietin allows patients to achieve higher hemoglobin concentrations without exposure to transfused blood/blood components. A recent randomized trial enrolled over 1300 critically ill patients to receive either 40,000 units of exogenous erythropoietin or placebo. These authors found that patients randomized to erythropoietin received significantly less allogeneic RBC transfusions and had significantly greater increases in hemoglobin. Although no differences were found between groups in gross clinical outcomes (ie, death, renal failure, myocardial infarction), this study did not have the power to identify small differences in outcomes. This and other studies of exogenous erythropoietin therapy in critically ill patients clearly demonstrate that the bone marrow in many of these patients will respond to the administration of erythropoietin despite their illness, suggesting a blunted production of erythropoietin rather than a blunted response to erythropoietin. Exogenous erythropoietin therefore represents a therapeutic option for treating anemia in critical illness. Acute events in medicine and surgery often lead to many patients becoming anemic. Solutions to this process of anemia should be focused on preventing such events. Anemia after surgery represents an area for prevention. Blood conservation strategies can be performed with adequate results. Monk et al randomized 79 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy to preoperative autologous donation (PAD), preoperative exogenous erythropoietin therapy plus ANH immediately following induction of general anesthesia, and ANH alone. This study concluded that all three techniques resulted in similar hemostasis outcomes (eg, bleeding and transfusion rates), but ANH alone was the least expensive, and ANH plus exogenous erythropoietin and ANH alone resulted in a higher ICU hematocrit compared with PAD. Regardless of these prophylactic strategies, patients still become anemic after surgery or during critical illness. This acute event anemia usually is treated with RBC transfusion; however, autologous blood recovery (cell salvage systems) has been shown to be effective in patients with acute bleeding-related anemia, and this may reduce patients' exposure to allogeneic blood in these patients. There are no universally accepted treatment guidelines for managing anemia, and practice differs between clinicians, hospitals, regions, and countries. Transfusion medicine is evolving and incorporating many new pharmacological agents into the armamentarium of anemia and bleeding therapy. Accumulating evidence suggests that anemia in critically ill patients is common and correlated with poor outcomes. The management of anemia can improve outcomes; however, the optimal management of anemia is not performed universally. New approaches, continued research, and an understanding of anemia may result in more consistent and improved outcomes for critically ill patients."

            "abstract": "The Affordable Care Act offers strong support for comparative effectiveness research, which entails comparisons among active treatments, to provide the foundation for evidence-based practice. Traditionally, a key form of research into the effectiveness of therapeutic treatments has been placebo-controlled trials, in which a specified treatment is compared to placebo. These trials feature high-contrast comparisons between treatments. Historical trends in placebo-controlled trials have been evaluated to help guide the comparative effectiveness research agenda. We investigated placebo-controlled trials reported in four leading medical journals between 1966 and 2010. We found that there was a significant decline in average effect size or average difference in efficacy (the ability to produce a desired effect) between the active treatment and placebo. On average, recently studied treatments offered only small benefits in efficacy over placebo. A decline in effect sizes in conventional placebo-controlled trials supports an increased emphasis on other avenues of research, including comparative studies on the safety, tolerability, and cost of treatments with established efficacy."

We randomly assigned patients to a liberal transfusion strategy (a hemoglobin threshold of 10 g per deciliter) or a restrictive transfusion strategy (symptoms of anemia or at physician discretion for a hemoglobin level of <8 g per deciliter).

One questionnaire was to be answered by the anaesthetist and the other one by the surgeon involved in cases o perioperative death within the first 30 days after the operation. 12 out of 135 addressed hospitals agreed to participate in the study. These included four small hospitals, six medical centres of medium capacity (about 500 beds) and two University hospitals. In order to obtain an exact description of the events leading to perioperative death, the questionnaires consisted of approximately 60 questions for the collection of demographic data and the surgical as well as anaesthesiological perioperative management.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From 1989 to 1993 more than 300 cases of perioperative death were reported. Only 200 cases could be analyzed due to incompletely answered or unreturned questionnaires. The mean risk-classification (ASA) was 3.46, mean age 74.6 years. Approximately 40 percent of deaths occurred in patients older than 80 years. More than 80 percent of patients had at least one pre-existing cardiovascular disease with prevalence of 41% for pulmonary and gastrointestinal diseases. In the majority of cases abdominal operations were performed, followed by hip-surgery and surgery of the aorta. In 86% of the cases, the surgeon was experienced and had performed the respective operation more than 20 times. In 38.2% an anaesthetist in training was responsible for anaesthesia, but only 11.6% were without supervision of a specialist anaesthetist. The majority of patients received general anaesthesia (78%) and 8.5% had a combination of EDA and general anaesthesia. Regional anaesthesia was performed in 12.5%, local anaesthesia in only 1%. The average blood loss was approximately 1.600 ml (with a very wide range) and 42.5% of the patients needed a transfusion of blood components, primarily in the form of packed red blood cells. Seventeen serious incidents occurred intraoperatively, including three \"exitus in tabula\". Four patients died shortly after the operation in the ICU, the other ten incidents were managed in the operating room. In 11 of 17 incidents the patients suffered a cardiac arrest; nine patients were resuscitated. Two patients were not resuscitated in view of pre-existing diseases and inoperability. All of the hospitals had an ICU for postoperative care, but two of the smaller hospitals had no recovery rooms. In 22 cases of emergency operations, there was a delay due to a lack of personnel or to logistic problems. In five of these cases, the delay was described as a possible cofactor of perioperative mortality. The most frequent causes of perioperative death were myocardial failure (33.7%) and multi-organ-failure (19.2%), followed by respiratory insufficiency (13%) and septic shock in 9.3%. A necropsy was carried out in only 28 of 200 perioperative deaths (14%); 13% of the cases were discussed in a surgical and only 2.5% in an anaesthesiological mortality-conference. In 9 out of 12 hospitals no mortality-conferences were held. All surgeons and anaesthetists were asked for self-assessment on the basis of an analog scale ranging from 0 and 10 points. The average score was 8.52 points (surgical management) and 9.36 points (anaesthesiological management respectively), which is not always in correspondence with the information provided in the questionnaires.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In order to further reduce perioperative mortality in critically ill patients, every hospital should aim to optimize the structure of the surgical and anaesthesiological departments. A delay due to logistical or personnel problems may be a co-factor in perioperative mortality. Recovery rooms with experienced personnel should be the standard in postoperative anaesthesiological care. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)"

            "abstract": "The feasibility of a family-based clinic-integrated behavioral intervention to improve family management of type 1 diabetes was evaluated. In each of four clinical sites, 30-32 families (a total of 122) were randomized to intervention or usual care comparison groups. The WE*CAN intervention, based on family problem-solving methods, was delivered during three routine clinic visits by trained 'Health Advisors'. Of eligible families across the four sites, 83% agreed to participate, of whom 96% completed the baseline, mid-term, and postintervention assessments. Families participated in an average of 2.85 intervention sessions over an 8-month period. The intervention was integrated into the clinic setting without impairing clinic flow and was implemented with fidelity and consistency across sites by trained non-professionals. The findings provide evidence of the feasibility of conducting a multisite trial to evaluate the effects of a clinic-integrated problem-solving intervention to improve family management. Many lessons were learned that provide guidance for recruitment, measurement, and intervention for the larger clinical trial."

            "abstract": "Reduction of atrial fibrillation-associated stroke risk has become the leading indication for warfarin use. Optimal management of warfarin can only be achieved with a relatively complex infrastructure. Alternative anticoagulant agents have been developed, and 3 have demonstrated effectiveness, safety, and adherence that are comparable or superior to warfarin in the clinical trial setting. None of the novel agents requires routine laboratory testing to demonstrate effective anticoagulation. Whereas these new agents present potential advantages, such as fixed dosing and dramatically reduced intracranial hemorrhaging, they are also subject to caveats that ought to be considered in the context of an \"ideal\" anticoagulant. If used casually, they have the potential to worsen rather than improve health care outcomes. There is little question that the management burden of the novel agents will be less than with warfarin. However, with a hemorrhagic risk that was similar to warfarin in these trials, there will likely remain a significant need for both baseline education and some level of focused interval follow-up to assess for bleeding risk and adherence considerations. These novel agents offer a definite advance in the available management options for thromboembolic disease, but until we understand the requirements for safe and effective use in the routine clinical setting, we will not be able to establish the extent to which they should replace warfarin."

Adjunctive desipramine or amitriptyline showed no significant therapeutic advantage, when compared with haloperidol and placebo, on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. After 4 weeks of combine therapy, patients receiving adjunctive amitriptyline or desipramine, as compared with those receiving adjunctive placebo, tended to score higher on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale hallucinatory behavior item and on the thinking disturbance factor than patients receiving placebo. These results suggest that adjunctive antidepressants are not indicated for the treatment of depressive symptoms in actively psychotic schizophrenic inpatients.

In order to test this hypothesis, 54 patients with hematologic malignancy or marrow aplasia were entered on a prospective randomized trial using cotton-wool filtration as a method of leukocyte depletion of red cell and platelet concentrates. Forty patients were considered evaluable; 20 patients received filtered products and 20 patients in the control group received standard unfiltered products. The filter was 99% efficient in removal of leukocytes (average number of WBC/platelet product, 6 X 10(6)). Platelet loss by this technique was 8%. Alloimmunization was assessed by detection of de novo formed lymphocytotoxic and platelet specific antibodies by microcytotoxicity test, Staph A protein radioimmunoassay, and solid phase red cell adherence test. In the group receiving filtered products, three of 20 (15%) patients developed lymphocytotoxic antibodies while ten of 20 (50%) patients in the control group developed cytotoxic antibodies (P = .01 by actuarial methods). Platelet antibodies were detected in seven of ten alloimmunized patients in the control group and three of three patients in the study group. Clinical evidence of refractoriness was seen in three of 20 patients in the filtered group and ten of 20 in the control group (P = .01 by actuarial methods). The cost of filtration was a fraction of the cost of a plateletpheresis product. Filtration appears to be an effective and economical method for reducing alloimmunization and clinical refractoriness to random donor platelets in patient receiving long-term transfusion support."

Infants were examined postnatally with real-time ultrasonography for evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. Maternal demographics, pregnancy complications, antenatal management, and route of delivery did not differ between the phenobarbital group (n = 50) and the placebo group (n = 60). The total incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage did not differ between the phenobarbital-treated (n = 54) and the placebo-treated (n = 67) infants. However, the frequency of grade 3 and grade 4 hemorrhages was 15% (10 infants) in the placebo group and 3.7% (2 infants) in the phenobarbital group (p less than 0.05). There were no differences in the severity of associated conditions in the babies to explain the difference in the incidence of severe hemorrhage between the study groups.

The presence of bleeding and abnormal tests of coagulation were associated with receiving larger transfusions (≥ 3 units), while patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery and those with a haemoglobin level over 7 g/dl had the lowest risk of receiving ≥ 3 units in any one transfusion episode.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The majority of red cells are now prescribed in a medical setting. With an ageing population and increasing therapeutic interventions, the demand for blood is likely to increase despite efforts to reduce usage by eliminating inappropriate transfusions through education and behaviour change. The post-transfusion target (and therefore the number of units to transfuse) for any given clinical situation as well as guidance on a 'safe' transfusion threshold should be considered in future guidelines."

AT877 is characterized by its strong spasmolytic activity, its inhibition of intracellular calcium ion activity, and the inhibition of several protein kinases. A total of 113 patients (Hunt and Hess grades I to IV) who had undergone surgery within 3 days of aneurysmal rupture entered the study. Patients were divided into 5 groups according to the total daily dose of AT877: I: 20 mg; II: 40 mg; III: 60 mg; IV: 90 mg; and V: 120-180 mg. AT877 was given by intravenous infusion over 30 min two or three times a day for 14 days after surgery. Although AT877 did not completely abolish angiographic vasospasm, severe vasospasm was seen less frequently in patients given higher doses. Vasospasm was the cause of a poor clinical outcome (Glasgow outcome scale rating 3 or greater) in 19%, 7%, 9%, 8%, and 6% of the patients in groups I to V, respectively. The results indicated a favourable clinical effect of AT877 at doses above 40 mg per day. Only mild hypotension was seen, even when 60 mg of AT877 was infused over 30 min. AT877 appears to be effective in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Part of its effect may be attributable to protection of the brain from ischaemic insults due to chronic cerebral vasospasm. However, the drug still needs to be evaluated in a placebo-controlled double-blind trial (which is currently being carried out)."

Laboratory Corporation of America acquired an interest in the GD partnership in mid 2002. We service more than 10,000 community-based Canadian clinicians, hospital partners, and private clients with an integrated customer-focused system that includes specimen collection, transportation, and results reporting services. With more than 1,700 highly qualified medical, technical, and support staff and a network of laboratories, Gamma Dynacare aims to be at the forefront of technological innovation to better service the clinician base and ultimately deliver better patient care. We were looking for a hematology analyzer that would allow. (1) standardization throughout Ontario in our 4 largest sites and (2) better performance to effectively handle aged samples and minimize slide review. To select the best, most productive hematology analyzer for our environment, it was decided to perform a side-by-side comparison of the top hematology analyzers from Abbott (Cell-Dyn 3500), Beckman Coulter (LH 750), Bayer (Advia 120), and Sysmex (XE 2100), utilizing the same samples. CBC, differential and reticulocyte parameters were all evaluated according to CLSI (formerly NCCLS) and established hematology analyzer evaluation guidelines. We assessed each analyzer for precision, linearity, carryover, stability, differential capabilities, slide review rates, and throughput (clean bench studies). Two hundred samples were assessed for differential and morphology flagging on each analyzer using the reference 400 cell manual differential for comparison. Throughput was assessed by analyzing 700 consecutive samples representative of our workload mix. Stability studies at 24 hours showed that the Beckman Coulter LH 750 was least affected by EDTA, effect with minimal changes in the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and hematocrit. Both the Bayer Advia 120 and Sysmex XE 2100 showed an elevation of the MCV (up to 5 fL) and Hematocrit over the 24 hours. Analysis of the 200 randomly selected patient samples showed that, while the false-negative rates on each of the instruments were comparable, there were significant differences in the false-positive rates. This has important implications for slide review rates. For our specimen mix, the Sysmex XE 2100 had the highest false-positive rate (15%), followed by the Cell-Dyn 3500 (8%), Advia 120 (6.5%) and the Beckman Coulter LH 750 (1.5%). Reticulocyte analysis performance was observed to be satisfactory with the Beckman Coulter LH 750, Cell-Dyn 3500, and XE 2100, while the Bayer Advia 120 showed a decrease in retic values after 12 hours. In conclusion, many laboratories will not be able to perform a 4-way evaluation such as described here due to time, space, and resource constraints. For our laboratories, result quality, sample stability performance, slide review rates, and efficiency were the primary criteria in selection of the most suitable hematology analyzer. Our 4-way evaluation resulted in selection of the Beckman Coulter LH 750 for Gamma-Dynacare Laboratories because it enabled the lowest slide review rate and handled aged samples better than the other analyzers."

The primary outcome variable was the proportion of children whose lactic acidosis resolved by four hours after transfusion.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-four of 37 (92%) of the children in the short storage treatment arm compared to 30/37 (81%) in the long storage arm achieved a blood lactate <5 mmol/L by four hours post transfusion (p value = 0.308). The mean time to lactic acidosis resolution was 2.65 hours (95% CI; 2.25-3.05) in the short storage arm, compared to 3.35 hours (95% CI; 2.60-4.10) in the long storage arm (p value = 0.264).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pilot data suggest that among children with severe malarial anaemia and lactic acidosis transfused with packed red blood cells, the storage age of blood does not affect resolution of lactic acidosis.

Imaging is not always able to clearly identify a tumor-related intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage (ICH), especially in the acute phase, the diagnosis being frequently based on evolution patterns. The aim of this study was to test the value of (99m)Tc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ((99m)Tc-MIBI) SPECT as a noninvasive diagnostic tool in early diagnosis of hemorrhagic brain neoplasm.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We prospectively studied 29 patients harboring a nontraumatic acute onset of clinical deterioration caused by ICH with atypical clinical or neuroradiologic features. All patients underwent (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT within 48 h from the clinical onset. Early and delayed images were obtained. Both visual and semiquantitative analyses were performed. The (99m)Tc-MIBI index was obtained from both early and delayed images and the retention index was calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In 19 patients (65.5%), a nonneoplastic hemorrhage (15 vascular degenerative diseases, 2 cavernous angiomas, 1 thrombosed middle cerebral artery giant aneurysm, and 1 sinus rectus thrombosis) was diagnosed by clinical and neuroradiologic follow-up or open surgery. In 10 patients (34.5%), a neoplastic hemorrhage (6 metastases, 2 glioblastomas multiforme, 1 ependymoma, and 1 intracranial angioblastic meningioma) was diagnosed by direct histologic typing (open surgery or stereotactic biopsy). In all neoplasm-related hemorrhages, a focal increased tracer uptake was observed in the area of the lesion, whereas no focal increased tracer uptake was noted in all nonneoplastic hematomas. A wide cutoff in the early ratio between neoplastic and nonneoplastic hemorrhages was found. Moreover, a statistically significant difference was found in the delayed ratio (P < 0.01) and the retention index (P < 0.05) between the 2 groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our data suggest that (99m)Tc-MIBI SPECT could play a role in the early noninvasive diagnostic work-up of hemorrhagic brain lesions, allowing a clear differentiation between neoplastic and nonneoplastic ICHs.

Splenectomy was to be performed in the anti-D group if patients failed to respond to three consecutive anti-D treatments given within 10 days. The incidences of splenectomy were 14 of 37 (38%) in the routine care group and 14 of 33 (42%) in the anti-D group (absolute risk reduction = 4.6% in favor of the routine care group, 95% CI, -18.4 to 27.6%). However, splenectomy was performed prematurely, not according to the protocol, in 11 of 14 patients in the anti-D group. The median time to splenectomy was 36 days (range, 9-78) in the routine care group and 112 days (range, 19-558) in the anti-D group (P = 0.045 at 100 days after randomization, P = 0.840 at 1 year after randomization, using log-rank analysis). Patients in the anti-D group were treated with prednisone for fewer days (70 days) compared to the routine care group (112 days, P = 0.01). No major bleeding events occurred. In this study, initial treatment of patients with intermittent anti-D initially deferred splenectomy. Whether our aggressive regimen of anti-D could have prevented splenectomy if it had been adhered to in all patients remains uncertain. However, compliance with this anti-D regimen was not feasible for many patients and/or their physicians."

            "abstract": "Because of their action as cerebral vasodilators, dihydropyridine calcium antagonists have received intense scrutiny for their potential benefit in ameliorating the devastating consequences of delayed cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). From October, 1987, to September, 1989, 41 North American neurosurgical centers in the Cooperative Aneurysm Study accrued 906 patients with recent (Days 0 to 7) aneurysmal SAH into a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial of high-dose intravenous nicardipine to test whether treatment with this agent improved overall outcome. Eligible patients received 0.15 mg/kg/hr of either nicardipine or placebo by continuous infusion for up to 14 days following hemorrhage. The 449 patients randomly assigned to the nicardipine-treated group and the 457 patients assigned to the placebo-treated group were balanced with regard to prognostic factors for ischemic deficits from vasospasm and for overall outcome. Other medical and surgical interventions were used with similar frequency in both groups, except that antihypertensive agents were used less frequently in the nicardipine-treated patients (26% of the nicardipine-treated group vs. 43% of the placebo-treated group, p < 0.001), and more patients in the placebo-treated group had intentional hypervolemia, induced hypertension, and/or hemodilution administered therapeutically for symptomatic vasospasm (38% of the placebo-treated group vs. 25% of the nicardipine-treated group, p < 0.001). The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm during the treatment period was higher in the placebo-treated group (46%) than in the nicardipine-treated group (32%) (p < 0.001). Despite the reduction in symptomatic vasospasm in the nicardipine-treated group, overall outcome at 3 months was similar between the two groups. Fifty-five percent of nicardipine-treated patients were rated as having a good recovery according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale at follow-up review and 17% were dead, compared to 56% and 18%, respectively, in the placebo-treated group (not statistically significant). These data suggest that high-dose intravenous nicardipine treatment is associated with a reduced incidence of symptomatic vasospasm in patients with recent aneurysmal SAH, but not with an improvement in overall outcome at 3 months when compared to standard management in North America. It is postulated that, while nicardipine prevents vasospasm, hypertensive/hypervolemic therapy may be effective in reversing ischemic deficits from vasospasm once they occur."

The intraoperative administration of blood products, including packed red blood cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), is often live saving. Complications of blood transfusions contribute considerably to perioperative costs and blood product resources are limited. Consequently, strategies to optimize the decision to transfuse are needed. Bleeding during surgery is a dynamic process and may result in major blood loss and coagulopathy due to dilution and consumption. The indication for transfusion should be based on reliable coagulation studies. While hemoglobin levels and platelet counts are available within 15 minutes, standard coagulation studies require one hour. Therefore, the decision to administer FFP has to be made in the absence of any data. Point of care testing of prothrombin time ensures that one major parameter of coagulation is available in the operation theatre within minutes. It is fast, easy to perform, inexpensive and may enable physicians to rationally determine the need for FFP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The objective of the POC-OP trial is to determine the effectiveness of point of care prothrombin time testing to reduce the administration of FFP.

Patients are randomized to usual care plus point of care prothrombin time testing or usual care alone without point of care testing. The primary outcome is the relative risk to receive any FFP perioperatively.

Poly(2-methoxyethylacrylate) (PMEA, X-coating) is a new polymer coating used in the ECC. PMEA studies have shown excellent biocompatibility with the components of blood. In this evaluation, PMEA-coated ECC were compared with control (CTR) circuits with emphasis on hematological parameters, peri-operative homologous blood product usage, and clinical outcomes. Patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to either a PMEA group (n = 30) or a CTR group (n = 30). Extracorporeal circuit components in the PMEA group were coated except for the cardioplegia delivery device and cannulas. Patients in the CTR group had just the arterial line filter coated. The following hematological parameters were measured: platelet count (PLT), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), and hematocrit (Hct). Blood product usage was observed along with clinical outcomes for the following parameters: ventilation time, mediastinal tube output, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay. The preoperative patient profiles were comparable between the two groups. The PMEA group had marginally higher CPB times (134+/-31.9 vs. 118+/-33.7 minutes) and cross clamp times (83.9+/-21.3 vs. 73.7+/-21.6 minutes), however no significant differences were reached. Platelet count, RBC, and Hct levels were also comparable between groups with no significant differences. However, there was a significant difference in WBC between groups (p = 0.041).

At 3 months, there were no significant differences in outcome by treatment group. Of the 170 patients, 11 (6%) died, and only 95 (56%) had a good outcome. Principal causes of unfavorable outcome were poor initial condition, delayed cerebral ischemia, and surgical complications.

To date, researchers have had only limited success in finding ways to reduce transfusions significantly in this patient population.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To reduce RBC transfusions for these infants by using a point-of-care bedside monitor that returns analyzed blood to the patient.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and patients:\n        \n      \n      This was a prospective, 2-center, randomized, open, controlled, clinical trial with a 1:1 assignment of extremely low birth weight infants (weighing 500-1000 g at birth) to control or monitor groups and analysis with the intention-to-treat approach. Predefined RBC transfusion criteria were applied uniformly in the 2 groups.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Clinical treatment of study subjects with an in-line, ex vivo, bedside monitor that withdraws blood through an umbilical artery catheter, analyzes blood gases and sodium, potassium, and hematocrit levels, and returns the sample to the patient.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcome measures:\n        \n      \n      The total volume and number of RBC transfusions during the first 2 weeks of life and the total volume of blood removed for laboratory testing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The trial was terminated prematurely when one center's NICU changed its standard method of laboratory testing. In the first 2 weeks of life, there was a nonsignificant 17% lower cumulative RBC transfusion volume in the monitor group (n = 46), compared with the control group (n = 47). However, data from the first week only (the period of greater catheter use) demonstrated a significant 33% lower cumulative RBC transfusion volume in the monitor group. Cumulative phlebotomy loss was approximately 25% less in the monitor group throughout the 2-week study period. There was no difference between groups in neonatal mortality, morbidity, and neurodevelopmental outcome rates at 18 to 24 months. This is the first randomized trial documenting that RBC transfusions administered to neonates can by reduced by decreasing laboratory phlebotomy loss.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      As long as an umbilical artery catheter is available for blood sampling with an in-line blood gas and chemistry monitor, significant reductions in neonatal RBC transfusions can be achieved.

Endralazine was more effective than dihydralazine, but the side effects were about the same in frequency and severity, apart from flushing, which was more common with endralazine. Patients receiving endralazine in the second phase of the cross-over design continued to be treated with endralazine for a period of 10-12 months. Blood pressure control remained good during this time, and the dosage was slightly reduced. No side effects suggestive of drug-induced lupus were seen, and only borderline changes in immunological tests [antinuclear antibodies (ANA)] in one patient were seen. One patient was reported to have lupus erythematosus (LE) cells in the peripheral blood but the ANA test was negative. Endralazine appears to be a useful new drug for the treatment of hypertension."

            "abstract": "Patients with solid tumours undergoing high-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation use an average of 10 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) while awaiting haemopoietic reconstitution. They are also known to have inappropriately low endogenous erythropoietin levels for their degree of anaemia. This pilot study was designed to determine the effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on erythroid recovery and PRBC transfusion requirements. Ten patients received high-dose chemotherapy (days -7 to -3), bone marrow reinfusion (day 0), and then rHuEPO (day 1 onward). RHuEPO (200 units/kg intravenous bolus daily), along with iron supplementation, was administered for 28 d or until a haematocrit (Hct) of 35% (independent of transfusions) was reached, whichever occurred first. PRBCs were routinely given for Hct < or = 25% and platelets for counts < 20,000/microliters. Eight (80%) patients developed a brisk reticulocytosis (median peak reticulocyte count 0.32 x 10(9)/l) and a haematocrit > or = 30% independent of red blood cell transfusions within 32 d of receiving marrow, as compared to 20/37 (54%) similarly treated controls. An unexpected finding was the more rapid engraftment in myeloid and platelet lineages in a subset of rHuEPO-treated patients. Quick return of red blood cells (17 v 33 d) (P = 0.0001), platelets (14 v 19 d) (P = 0.04), and neutrophils (13 v 25 d) (P = 0.01) (with circulating myeloblasts and early myeloid forms) characterized recovery from an ifosfamide-based intensification with rHuEPO support. Similar trilineage enhancement of haemopoiesis did not occur with the possibly more myeloablative cyclophosphamide-based regimens. Despite the enhancement by rHuEPO on reticulocytosis, there was no significant decrease in PRBC transfusion requirements. RHuEPO proved to be a well-tolerated agent in enhancing reticulocytosis following high-dose chemotherapy. Further study to elucidate the activity of erythropoietin on both erythroid and non-erythroid growth and maturation appears warranted."

We sought to compare resource use, costs and clinical outcomes between treatment groups and report the results using a cost-consequences framework.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Pre-specified methods were used to assign costs (US dollars, year 2004-5 values) to medical resources and patient time using a societal perspective. Costs for inpatient care, outpatient care and physician services were based on US Medicare reimbursement rates. Indirect costs assigned to patient time spent receiving study medication were based on the mean hourly wage in the US. In the base-case analysis, the average wholesale price was used to assign costs to medications. Clinical outcomes included all haemoglobin levels and transfusions recorded throughout the trial. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of different costing methods, cost sources, perspectives and methods to assign haemoglobin values following a blood transfusion.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Over a mean follow-up duration of 11.8 weeks, the average cost of study medications and their administration was the single largest component of total costs and was similar between groups (epoetin alfa 5979 US dollars and darbepoetin alfa 5935 US dollars, difference 44 US dollars; 95% CI -590, 692). There were no significant differences in the proportions of patients hospitalised (epoetin alfa 24.6%, darbepoetin alfa 22.0%; p = 0.57).

However, with regard to transfusions, patients in the epoetin alfa arm required fewer units of blood than patients in the darbepoetin alfa arm (0.46 vs 0.88, 95% CI for the difference -0.77, -0.08). Mean total costs, comprising costs for study medications and their administration, inpatient care, transfusions, unplanned radiation therapy, haematology and laboratory services, chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy drugs and indirect costs were 14,976 US dollars in the epoetin alfa arm compared with 14,101 US dollars in the darbepoetin alfa arm, a difference of 875 US dollars (95% CI for difference -849, 2607), of which 98% of the difference was attributable to higher inpatient costs in the epoetin alfa arm (2374 US dollars vs 1520 US dollars; 95% CI for difference -33, 1955).

One hundred and thirty-nine patients above 15 years of age with severe head injuries were included in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups--carbamazepine versus placebo. Prophylaxis was started immediately after the accident and was continued for one and a half to two years. Carbamazepine dosage was adjusted individually to provide serum levels within therapeutic range. In case of a seizure all the necessary clinical management was initiated. Patients on carbamazepine showed a lower probability of post-traumatic seizures than those on placebo (p less than 0.05). This difference was statistically significant with regard to early seizures within the first week and with regard to the follow-up time in total, but not regarding late seizures per se. Brain lesions with a high risk of post-traumatic seizures were situated in the parietal and temporal areas and included acute subdural haematomas in all locations, temporal lobe contusions, parietal epidural haematomas accompanied by other lesions and the deep stages of coma. Brain stem contusions were accompanied by a rather low probability of seizures. The above mentioned types and locations of brain lesions with the exception of brain stem contusions justify antiepileptic prophylaxis. The regimen consists of oral carbamazepine 100 mg three times daily by gastric tube during the first two days increasing to about 200 mg three times daily on the third day corresponding to the serum level. If oral medication is not possible within the initial twelve hours, phenytoin in a dose of 750 mg Phenhydan-Infusion Konzentrate is given on the first day, followed by an intravenous dose of 250-500 mg on the second day or until oral carbamazepine administration is tolerated.

Outcomes of patients treated by residents given the algorithm were as good and in a number of respects better than those of patients treated by residents without the algorithm. The mean resuscitation time of the protocol group was markedly and significantly less than that of the control group indicating that the policy of using the algorithm facilitated resuscitation even though it was not always properly followed.

Assessments of depression severity were completed 36 hours and 6 days thereafter.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The adolescents who received pulse clomipramine treatment demonstrated significant decreases in Hamilton depression scores from baseline at 6 days but not at 36 hours. A similar decrease from baseline was found in Clinical Global Impression severity at 6 days but not 36 hours. Seven of the clomipramine-treated patients and three of the saline-treated patients had drops of 50% or more from baseline in Hamilton depression score.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pulse clomipramine (200 mg i.v.) is associated with dramatic reduction in depressive symptoms at day 6 after infusion, which is significantly different from the effect of placebo."

A total of 131 patients participated in the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the multicenter study. For the first 6 weeks (fixed-dose period), patients were randomized to receive 100 U/kg of epoetin beta or placebo thrice weekly; in the second 6 weeks (dose-adjustment period), the dose of epoetin beta ranged from 50 to 150 U/kg thrice weekly. Of the 131 patients who entered the placebo-controlled period, 122 crossed over to a 24-week open-label period, where all patients received active drug and doses of epoetin beta could be individually titrated after the first 6 weeks. One hundred patients completed the 36-week study. In all phases of the study, epoetin beta was shown to produce a consistent, sustained increase in hemoglobin (baseline, 7.1 +/- 0.1 to 10.5 +/- 0.2 g/dL) and hematocrit (baseline, 21.5 to 32.7%), which virtually eliminated the need for packed red blood cell transfusions. Reticulocyte counts rose initially in response to epoetin beta and stabilized at levels higher than baseline throughout the remainder of the study period (baseline, 1.7 to 2.5%). The placebo group showed no change in these parameters during the double-blind period. Similar patterns of response were seen in the original placebo group after crossover to active drug (mean hemoglobin increase, 2.6 +/- 0.5).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Introduction.– Postoperative anaemia is common in frail elderly hip fracture patients. Blood transfusion down regulates immune responses. Numerous studies suggest that transfusions slightly increase the risk of infections. Our aim is to assess whether a liberal postoperative blood transfusion strategy increases the risk of infection.\nText.– Patients and methods.– One hundred and eighty-five hip fracture patients with postoperative anaemia aged 65 or older admitted from nursing home or senior housing for surgery were enrolled. The patients were randomized to two different blood transfusion strategies, a liberal and a restrictive. In the liberal strategy, transfusions were given when the hemoglobin level was less than 7 mmol/l (11.3 g/dl). In the restrictive strategy, transfusions were given at hemoglobin levels below 6 mmol/l (9.7 g/dl). During the first 30 postoperative days, C-reactive proteins (CRP), and leucocytes were determined weekly, and time to first treatment-requiring infection indicated by a positive urine culture or suspected infection.\nResults.– The likelihood ratio test (LRT) of the repeated measurements of CRP showed no difference in the logarithm transformed CRP-values (P = 0.85) in the two groups. LRT of the repeated measurements of leucocytes showed no difference in the logarithm transformed leucocytes (P = 0.55). In a Cox regression model, time to first infection after surgery was similar in the two groups (Hazard Ratio 0.81 [95% confidence interval: 0.58; 1.14]).\nConclusion.– A liberal strategy of blood transfusion does not increase the risk of infection after hip fracture in the frail elderly compared to a restrictive transfusion strategy.\nDisclosure.– No significant relationships."

A recent formulation, highly polymerized HBOC-201 (Biopure, Cambridge, MA), has been found to be less vasoactive than prior less polymerized formulations, and to improve outcome in animal models of hemorrhagic shock (HS) compared with standard resuscitation fluids. HBOCs are envisioned to have life- saving potential for severe trauma patients for whom death due to HS is common despite transport to level I trauma centers. As part of a benefit:risk analysis for a proposed clinical trial of HBOC-201 in patients with traumatic HS, we analyzed data from a previous phase III clinical trial of this HBOC that involved orthopedic surgery patients, for vasoactivity and related effects, with focus on patients more representative of the trauma population.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      In a previous phase III study involving orthopedic surgery patients, HEM-0115, consented/stabilized patients were randomized to receive HBOC-201 (N = 350) (up to ten 30 g Hb units) or red blood cells (RBC) (N = 338) (up to 9 units) at the first transfusion decision. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) responses, key system and individual adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events, and cardiac biomarker elevation incidences, were compared in the overall population and subpopulations with stable trauma, hypotension, and with age stratification (Student's t and Fisher's exact tests, significance p < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Mild to moderate peak SBP responses were common in HBOC-201 subjects and more common than with RBC in the overall population (mean, 60.8 years old), but less frequent in HBOC-201 subjects with stable trauma, younger age (<50 years old), and hypotension, in whom group differences were narrowed. SBP Delta responses were more common with HBOC-201 than RBC in the overall population, but not in subjects with stable trauma and <50 year olds, in whom response rates were lower. In the overall population, AEs were more common than with RBC in most systems (also, hypertension and stroke); only cardiac system serious adverse events were more common with HBOC-201. In contrast, there were few significant group differences in stable trauma, hypotensive, and <70 and especially <50-year-old subjects, in whom AE incidences were generally lower. A disproportionate number of key AEs occurred in elderly subjects. Troponin (but not CK-MB) elevation was more frequent with HBOC-201 than RBC in the overall population but not in <50 year olds, and was not associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or death.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our limited HEM-0115 safety analysis shows that key potentially vasoactivity-related adverse safety signals were more frequent with HBOC-201 than RBC in older patients undergoing orthopedic surgery with rapid access to safe blood transfusions. That incidences of these safety signals were generally lower and group differences narrowed in subpopulations with stable trauma, hypotension, and younger age, suggests an acceptable safety profile in younger acute trauma populations, especially in settings where rapid access to safe blood transfusions is unavailable; confirmation in controlled clinical trials is urgently warranted."

This large, multicenter, randomized clinical trial was designed to compare the addition of diaspirin cross-linked hemoglobin (DCLHb) with standard care in the initial resuscitation of adults experiencing severe, uncompensated, traumatic hemorrhagic shock. Before the first planned interim analysis of the data, review of fatal adverse events revealed an imbalance in mortality between the 2 treatment groups. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) recommended suspension of patient enrollment 24 days later. Additional data collection and analyses confirmed the excess number of deaths in patients treated with DCLHb but failed to reveal the cause of these deaths. The trial was formally terminated after only 112 of the planned 850 patients had been enrolled. We review the events leading up to and the rationale behind the DMC recommendations for suspension of patient enrollment and trial termination. Although the DCLHb trial was unsuccessful in achieving its goals, the monitoring process worked well. Emergency research was facilitated by DMC oversight, and the interests of research subjects were protected by the actions of the DMC."

Blood transfusion, previously the only available treatment for chemotherapy-induced anemia, may result in some clinical or subclinical adverse effects in the recipients. Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) provides a new treatment modality for chemotherapy-induced anemia.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effect of rhEPO on the need for blood transfusions and on hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations, 227 patients with solid tumors and chemotherapy-induced anemia were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, clinical trial. Of 189 patients evaluable for efficacy, 101 received 5000 IU rhEPO daily s.c., while 88 patients received no treatment during the 12-week controlled phase of the study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The results demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the need for blood transfusions (28% vs. 42%, P = 0.028) and in the mean volume of packed red blood cells transfused (152 ml vs. 190 ml, P = 0.044) in patients treated with rhEPO compared to untreated controls.

            "abstract": "The prospective randomized controlled study enrolled 58 patients diagnosed as having brain injury and hemorrhagic stroke. Enteral feeding was started within the first 24 hours after admission to an intensive care unit (ICU); a control group (n = 28) was given an isocalorie formula while a study group (n = 28) received a combination of a hypercalorie formula and a fiber-containing formula. In the study group, the intestine was stimulated with erythromycin within the first 3 days. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and APACHE II scores, the degree of a systemic inflammatory response (SIR) and multiple organ failure (MOF), serum albumin and glucose levels, energy expenditure and balance, and nitrogen excretion and balance were estimated on day 10. Treatment results on day 30, length of ICU stay, AV duration, mortality, and use of blood preparations were compared. On study day 10, nitrogen and energy balances and the pattern of signs of SIR and MOF were significantly better and fresh frozen plasma and albumin solutions were used less in the study group than in the control one. There were differences in APACHE II and GCS scores, energy expenditure and nitrogen loss, plasma albumin and glucose concentrations, mortality, and volume of used packed red blood cells. The original enteric feeding protocol based on the use of dietary fiber-fortified hypercalorie diets in combination with the new method of gastric motility stimulation makes it possible to reduce the accumulation of deficiency of energy and plastic substrates, to alleviate the manifestations of SIR and MOF and to decrease the consumption of blood components and preparations."

Women expecting to deliver singleton babies vaginally (ie, not planned caesarean section) were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) with a centrally generated allocation sequence, stratified by country, to placental delivery with gravity and maternal effort (simplified package) or controlled cord traction applied immediately after uterine contraction and cord clamping (full package). After randomisation, allocation could not be concealed from investigators, participants, or assessors. Oxytocin 10 IU was administered immediately after birth with cord clamping after 1-3 min. Uterine massage was done after placental delivery according to local policy. The primary (non-inferiority) outcome was blood loss of 1000 mL or more (severe haemorrhage). The non-inferiority margin for the risk ratio was 1·3. Analysis was by modified intention-to-treat, excluding women who had emergency caesarean sections.

In search of efficient chemotherapy protocols we combined cisplatin with epirubicin (PE scheme) in our clinic. Massive side effects of that aggressive chemotherapy scheme like gastro-intestinal trouble and myelotoxicity are the limiting factors of the scheme. With measures like reducing the dosage, delaying the next cycle, or breaking off the therapy the effective dosage can often not be achieved. The anti-emetics which are usually used today exclusively give anti-emetic protection. The additional administration of xenogenic peptides (Factor AF2) had additionally myeloprotective effect in former studies. In this study we examined whether, by additionally giving Factor AF2, the patients' subjective condition, and above all their hemogram, could be stabilised in order to achieve the effective dosage or dosage intensity. For that, the patients were prospectively randomised in two groups by means of a random selection board. The analysis of the data gained in the protocol showed that the additional administration of Factor AF2 improves the patients' subjective conditions significantly. Apart from that, we noticed a considerable reduction of the vomiting frequency. Concerning the objective measured parameters of the leukocytes, thrombocytes, erythrocytes, and the hemoglobin level, the significantly myeloprotective effect of Factor AF2 could be proved. Due to the fact that in the verum group there were considerably fewer cases of breaking off or delays of the treatment than in the control group, the effective dosage intensity could be achieved with a higher number of patients in that group."

We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to determine the safety and efficacy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; filgrastim) as an adjunct to phase I of induction chemotherapy for adult ALL. Patients (n = 53) were randomized to receive no growth factor or G-CSF (5 microg/kg/d subcutaneously) starting on day 2 of chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin (45 mg/m2) and vincristine (1.5 mg/m2) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; L-asparaginase (2500 U/m2) on days 1 through 14; and prednisone (60 mg/m2) on days 1 through 28. A total of 25 patients in the G-CSF group and 26 patients in the control arm fulfilled the inclusion criteria of the study. G-CSF markedly ameliorated neutropenia because the median proportion of days with neutropenia less than 1,000/microL was 29% in the G-CSF group as compared with 84% in the control arm (P < .00005). The median time to reach absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) > or = 1,000/microL was 16 days in G-CSF patients and 26 days in controls (P < .001). More importantly, G-CSF significantly reduced the incidence of febrile neutropenia (12% v 42% in controls, P < .05) and documented infections (40% v 77%, P < .05). No significant differences were found with regard to requirements for red blood cell transfusions and platelet concentrates. A total of 24 of 25 (96%) patients in the G-CSF group and 20 of 25 (80%) evaluable control patients had complete remission after phase I of induction therapy.

In the ELG group, the primary technical success rate was 100% with a 30-day mortality rate of 2.0%. The average hospital length of stay was 3.28 days with ICU stay of 1.20 days. The average operative estimated blood loss was 501 mL (100-2,500) with average transfusions of 0.49 unit packed red blood cells (prbc) (0-6). Eighty-eight percent of ELG patients left the hospital without complication. Seven patients (14%) required 11 follow-up procedures for complications including endoleak, limb or graft thrombosis, graft stenosis, distal embolization, or wound complications. Three of 26 patients (11%) with 6-month computed tomography follow-up had evidence of endoleak (2 have subsequently undergone lumbar embolization). Only 1 6-month follow-up patient had shown increased aneurysm size before endoleak treatment. A team of board-certified vascular surgeons at a nonclinical trial center can safely perform ELG for AAA with results similar to those of published series from trial centers."

            "abstract": "In this study, it is hypothesized that a planned increase in the dose of recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO) can prevent transfusion in very low birth weight infants. Two different regimens of rh-EPO were administrated, one consisting in increasing dosage up to 5000 U/kg/wk, according to the individual reticulocytes response, and the second in a standard therapy of 1250 U/kg/wk. Fifty-one infants participated. Despite a significant higher reticulocytosis, the study was prematurely terminated due to the results of an interim analysis showing that transfusion was not avoided by increasing the rh-EPO. No significant differences were found between the two regimens concerning transfusion rate, volume transfused, gain in weight, and adverse effects. Progressive titration of rh-EPO to improve the biological response does not leave premature infants free of transfusion."

For this purpose, 65 consecutive never transfused patients suffering from end-stage renal failure were assigned to one of two groups: the first group was transfused with 1 unit of packed red cells (containing a mean of 2350 x 10(6) leukocytes, 900 x 10(6) mononuclear cells) 3 times at 15-day intervals. The second group received one transfusion of about 30 ml of blood adjusted to contain 100 x 10(6) mononuclear cells. While no definitive conclusions are still possible, preliminary data indicate the following: (1) three small transfusions are capable of immunizing the recipient, but lymphocytotoxic antibodies tend to disappear rapidly; (2) in vitro lymphocyte response to lectins of patients receiving small transfusions is not significantly different from that of patients receiving standard transfusions; (3) the two groups of patients differ significantly as far as the T4+ /T8+ cell ratio is concerned: in fact while a decrease of the ratio is observed after standard transfusions, small transfusions determine an increase of the ratio, mainly due to a decrease in the number of T8+ cells; and (4) the clinical course and survival of the graft is worse in patients treated with small transfusions than in those treated with standard transfusions."

Bite cells are morphologically characterized as poikilocytes with one or more semicircular portions removed from the cell margin. The purpose of this report is to emphasize the importance of peripheral smear examination in patients with possible drug-associated hemolytic anemia.

Patients' characteristics, occurrences of transfusion, admission, pre-transfusion, post-transfusion and discharge haemoglobin concentrations have been collected. Two physicians (who are in charge) must evaluate the appropriateness of pre-transfusion, discharged haemoglobin concentrations, quantity and quality of transfused RBC. The mean pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentration was 7.89 ± 1.24, the median number of transfused RBC was two (extremes: 1-16), the mean discharge haemoglobin concentration was 10.14 ± 1.30 (-5 days after the end of transfusion). The pre-transfusion and discharge haemoglobin concentrations were higher if the patient presented a co-morbidity factor. Ninety-three percent of pre-transfusion and 79% of discharge haemoglobin concentrations are in accordance with the guidelines. According to the physicians, the RBC transfusions are too \"precocious\" when pre-transfusion haemoglobin concentration is above nine and the anaemia is asymptomatic. 50% of RBC transfusion with discharge haemoglobin concentration above 10 is not excessive. In case of acute anaemia, the pre-transfusion and discharge haemoglobin concentrations are higher and RBC transfusion excessive. In this study, the trigger haemoglobin concentration is \"restrictive\", but the target haemoglobin concentration is \"liberal\" with a high-discharge haemoglobin concentration. Inappropriate RBC transfusions are mainly due to over-transfusion."

            "abstract": "Patients with haematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic BMT were randomised to treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25). rHuEPO was given at 200 U/kg daily for 4 weeks and 200 U/kg twice weekly for a further 4 weeks. The groups were similar regarding several prognostic factors. There were no differences between the two groups regarding time to engraftment, fever, hospitalisation, GVHD, infections, haemorrhages, transplant-related mortality, relapse and survival. However, more patients in the control group had a raised serum creatinine (43% vs 14%; p = 0.04). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion requirements for the first 2 months after BMT were significantly lower in the rHuEPO group compared with the control group (5 units vs 10; p = 0.04). Time to unsupported Hb > 70 g/l was less in patients treated with rHuEPO (14 days vs 24; p = 0.03). No effect was seen on platelet engraftment or the number of transfused platelet units. Two patients in the control group compared with none in the rHuEPO group became refractory to platelet transfusions. According to the protocol the study drug was reduced (Hb > 100) or discontinued (Hb > 120) for a mean of 3.6 weeks among 11 rHuEPO patients compared with 1.9 weeks among 7 controls (p = 0.02). Seven of the treated patients compared with none of the controls reached Hb > 120 during the study period (p = 0.004). Among the rHuEPO treated patients, EPO-levels were significantly higher than in the controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Hepatic resection is the most effective treatment for many malignant and benign conditions affecting the liver and biliary tree. Despite improvements, major partial hepatectomy can be associated with considerable blood loss and transfusion requirements. Transfusion of allogeneic blood products, although potentially life-saving, is associated with many potential complications. The primary aim of this study was to determine if acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), an established blood conservation technique, reduces the requirement for allogeneic red cell transfusions in patients undergoing major hepatic resection.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred thirty patients undergoing major hepatic resection (> or =3 segments) were prospectively randomized to undergo either ANH or standard anesthetic management (STD). In the ANH group, intraoperative blood collection was performed to a target hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL. Low central venous pressure anesthetic technique was used intraoperatively for both groups. A standardized transfusion protocol was applied to all patients intraoperatively and throughout the hospital stay.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From April 2004 to March 2007, 63 patients were randomized to ANH and 67 to STD. Demographics, diagnoses, liver function, extent of resection, intraoperative blood loss, operative time, incidence and grade of complications, and length of hospital stay were similar between the 2 groups. ANH reduced the overall allogeneic red cell transfusion rate by 50% compared with STD [12.7% (n = 8) vs. 25.4% (n = 17), respectively; P = 0.067. ANH patients were less often transfused intraoperatively (n = 1, 1.6%) compared with the STD group (n = 7, 10.4%) (P = 0.036), had higher postoperative hemoglobin levels (P = 0.01), and tended to require fewer red cell units overall (28 vs. 47 units). In patients with intraoperative blood loss > or =800 mL, ANH reduced not only the allogeneic red cell transfusion rate (18.2% vs. 42.4%, P = 0.045) but also the proportion of patients requiring fresh frozen plasma (21.1% vs. 48.3%, P = 0.025).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      For patients undergoing major liver resection, ANH is safe, effectively reduces the need for allogeneic transfusions, and should be considered for routine use.

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that, unlike in patients submitted to allogeneic BMT, administration of recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) after autologous BMT (ABMT) had no significant effect on erythroid recovery and transfusional requirements. On the other hand, it has also been shown that combining Epo with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and with myelodysplastic syndromes resulted in additive effects on erythropoiesis. To test the effects of combined G-CSF + Epo therapy on erythroid recovery after autologous bone marrow transplantation a pilot randomized, three-arm trial was designed. Thirty patients suffering from lymphoid malignancies submitted to ABMT were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF alone (5 micrograms/kg, from day + 1 up to reaching an ANC > or = 10(9)/1), G-CSF + Epo (150 U/kg, from day +1 to +21), or neither of these (controls). Patients receiving G-CSF + Epo had significantly more reticulocytes on day +21 and reached 30 x 10(9)/1 reticulocytes earlier when compared to both G-CSF and control patients; however, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions was not modified by the addition of Epo to G-CSF, although both groups had significantly fewer units transfused than controls. No effect on platelet recovery or platelet transfusional requirements was observed. Myeloid recovery was comparable in the G-CSF and G-CSF+Epo groups, and significantly accelerated as compared to controls. We conclude that the addition of Epo to G-CSF causes a slight acceleration of erythroid recovery after ABMT, but is not associated with transfusional benefits. Therefore, the present data do not support the use of Epo in association with G-CSF to hasten erythroid recovery after ABMT."

We did not identify any ongoing RCTs.One cross-over TXA study (eight patients) was excluded from the outcome analysis because data from this study were at a high risk of bias. Data from the other three studies were all at unclear risk of bias due to lack of reporting of study methodology.Three studies (two TXA (12 to 56 patients), one EACA (18 patients)) reported in four articles (published 1983 to 1995) were included in the narrative review. All three studies compared the drug with placebo.All studies reported bleeding, but it was reported in different ways. All three studies suggested antifibrinolytics reduced the risk of bleeding. The first study showed a difference in average bleeding score of 42 in placebo (P) versus three (TXA). The second study only showed a difference in bleeding episodes during consolidation chemotherapy, with a mean of 2.6 episodes/patient (standard deviation (SD) 2.2) (P) versus a mean of 1.1 episodes/patient (SD 1.4) (TXA). The third study reported bleeding on 50% of days at risk (P) versus bleeding on 31% of days at risk (EACA).Two studies (68 patients) reported thromboembolism and no events occurred.All three studies reported a reduction in PlTx usage. The first study reported a difference of 222 platelet units (P) versus 69 platelet units (TXA). The second study only showed a difference in total platelet usage during consolidation chemotherapy, with a mean of 9.3 units (SD 3.3) (P) versus 3.7 (SD 4.1) (TXA). The third study reported one PlTx every 10.5 days at risk (P) versus one PlTx every 13.3 days at risk (EACA).Two studies reported red cell transfusion requirements and one study found a reduction in red cell transfusion usage.One study reported death due to bleeding as an outcome measure and none occurred.Only one study reported adverse events of TXA as an outcome measure and none occurred.None of the studies reported on the following pre-specified outcomes: overall mortality, adverse events of transfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or quality of life (QoL).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results indicate that the evidence available for the use of antifibrinolytics in haematology patients is very limited. The only available data suggest that TXA and EACA may be useful adjuncts to platelet transfusions so that platelet use, and the complications associated with their use, can be reduced. However, the trials were too small to assess whether antifibrinolytics increased the risk of thromboembolic events. Large, high-quality RCTs are required before antifibrinolytics can be demonstrated to be efficacious and safe in widespread clinical practice."

Apgar scores at one and five minutes and incidence of neonatal respiratory problems were not significantly different between groups. Babies in physiological group weighed mean of 85 g more than those in active group.

            "abstract": "Studies on baboons and preliminary observations in three patients with sickle cell anemia (SS) suggested that high doses of pulse administered recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) stimulate F-reticulocyte production. We now report on the administration of rHuEPO in a double-blind format to ascertain frequency of response and potential precipitation of side effects. Ten patients were enrolled, but one was discontinued due to the indication of a blood transfusion. Of the other nine, five received rHuEPO in escalating doses (from 400 to 1,500 U per kg twice daily [BID] per week), alternating with a placebo, in blinded fashion. The second group, consisting of four patients, followed an identical protocol (except starting dose was 1,000 U/Kg, BID per week) and were iron supplemented during treatment. The criterion of response was a transient doubling (as a minimum) of the steady-state F-reticulocyte level. We found that none of the five patients in the first group responded to rHuEPO, and two of them became iron deficient, as judged by a significant decrease in ferritin. Of the second group, four patients responded with F-reticulocyte increases. In three patients, open label administration of rHuEPO confirmed the effect. We observed seven painful episodes during this study, two during the EPO administration and five during the placebo arm. Three patients were phlebotomized because the hemoglobin level increased 1.5 g/dL more than steady-state levels. Of the six patients followed-up by percent dense cell determinations, one exhibited increased levels during periods of the treatment, whereas the other five showed no change. No anti-rHuEPO antibodies were detected. We conclude that rHuEPO can stimulate F-reticulocyte response in some patients with sickle cell anemia, without apparent negative clinical side effects. The state of iron stores may be critical. Whether higher doses of rHuEPO and/or a different regimen might induce sustained F cells and fetal hemoglobin increases remains to be determined."

Patients with AML undergoing induction or postremission consolidation chemotherapy were randomized into TA or placebo groups. Patients were not given platelet transfusions prophylactically but only when bleeding occurred. The severity of any bleeding event was scored. Thirty eight patients were randomized during induction. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of bleeding events and their severity or in the number of platelet transfusions given. Eighteen patients were studied during consolidation. In contrast, to the induction period, during consolidation there was a significantly less severe bleeding tendency in the TA group resulting in a lower platelet transfusion requirement [3.7 +/- 4.1 vs. 9.3 +/- 3.3 platelet units (p < .05)]. TA was well tolerated and no side effects were seen and no specific thromboembolic events were noticed. We conclude that giving TA during the thrombocytopenic period of AML patients undergoing consolidation chemotherapy is beneficial and safely reduces platelet transfusions."

Patients had substantial decreases over the first 6 months with respect to triglycerides, VLDL cholesterol, insulin, C peptide, and uric acid; these changes were sustained in the sibutramine group but not the placebo group. HDL cholesterol concentrations rose substantially in the second year: overall increases were 20.7% (sibutramine) and 11.7% (placebo, p<0.001). 20 (3%) patients were withdrawn because of increases in blood pressure; in the sibutramine group, systolic blood pressure rose from baseline to 2 years by 0.1 mm Hg (SD 12.9), diastolic blood pressure by 2.3 mm Hg (9.4), and pulse rate by 4.1 beats/min (11.9).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      This individualised management programme achieved weight loss in 77% of obese patients and sustained weight loss in most patients continuing therapy for 2 years.

Abdominal pain, bloating and altered bowel habit affect quality of life, social functioning and time off work. Current GP treatment relies on a positive diagnosis, reassurance, lifestyle advice and drug therapies, but many suffer ongoing symptoms.A recent Cochrane review highlighted the lack of research evidence for IBS drugs. Neither GPs, nor patients have good evidence to inform prescribing decisions. However, IBS drugs are widely used: In 2005 the NHS costs were nearly £10 million for mebeverine and over £8 million for fibre-based bulking agents. CBT and self-management can be helpful, but poor availability in the NHS restricts their use.

More patients in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm were transfused (100% vs 54%, p <0.001) and the average number of units transfused per patient tended to be higher in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm (2.5 vs 1.6, p = 0.07). The primary clinical safety measurement of in-hospital death, recurrent MI, or new or worsening congestive heart failure occurred in 8 patients in the liberal arm and 3 in the conservative arm (38% vs 13%, p = 0.046). In conclusion, compared to a conservative transfusion strategy, treating anemic patients with AMI according to a liberal transfusion strategy results in more patients receiving transfusions and higher hematocrit levels. However, this may be associated with worse clinical outcomes. A large-scale definitive trial addressing this issue is urgently required.\n"

            "abstract": "Despite aspirin's established role in the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease, considerable controversy exists regarding its most effective dosing strategy. In a retrospective observational study, we examined the relation between prescribed aspirin dose (<162 mg vs > or =162 mg/day aspirin) and clinical outcome in 4,589 placebo-treated patients enrolled in the Blockage of the Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor to Avoid Vascular Occlusion (BRAVO) trial over a median follow-up of 366 days. Standard Cox regression analysis was employed because propensity analysis was not feasible. Compared with lower aspirin doses, higher doses were associated with lower unadjusted all-cause mortality (2.9 vs 1.6%, respectively; log rank chi-square 8.6, p = 0.0034). Higher aspirin dose remained independently predictive of lower all-cause mortality in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.42 to 0.97, p = 0.037). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of the composite endpoint death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.1% vs 6.2%, p = 0.74). Higher aspirin dose was a significant independent predictor of any (hazard ratio 1.32, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.55, p = 0.001) but not serious bleeding. In conclusion, our findings suggest that aspirin doses of > or =162 mg/day may be more beneficial than those <162 mg/day at preventing death."

            "abstract": "Although considerable advances have been made in many aspects of platelet transfusion therapy in the last 30 years, some areas continue to provoke debate, including the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions for the prevention of thrombocytopenic bleeding in patients with bone marrow failure. We have designed a randomized controlled trial to compare prophylactic platelet use with a threshold of a platelet count of 10 x 10(9)/L with no prophylaxis in adult thrombocytopenic patients with hematologic malignancies. The trial question is whether a no-prophylactic policy for the use of platelet transfusions in patients with hematologic malignancies is not inferior to a threshold prophylactic policy at 10 x 10(9)/L, for bleeding at World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2, 3, or 4, up to 30 days from randomization. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients who have a significant clinical bleed, defined as WHO grade 2 or higher up to 30 days from randomization. Subsidiary clinical outcome measures include time to first bleed and a descriptive analysis of all severe bleeds. A bleeding assessment form is completed daily for all study subjects until day 30 from randomization. Minor modifications were made to the definitions at WHO grades 1 and 2 for petechiae and duration of nose bleeds, after piloting of the bleeding assessment forms. This study has been designed as a 2-stage randomized trial with an interim analysis planned after a minimum of 100 patients had been randomized and had completed their period of observation. Patients have initially been enrolled through 3 United Kingdom hematology centers. The interim analysis has been completed, and the results have confirmed a final sample size of 600 patients. Recruitment is now being extended to other centers in United Kingdom and Australia. Local research nurses are not blinded to treatment allocation, but a number of measures to reduce risk of assessment bias include repeated education around standard operating procedures, common definitions, and duplication of assessments. The expected completion date for the 5-year study is December 2011."

All consenting potential cadaver renal transplant recipients (n = 107) were randomly assigned to receive transfusions at 6-week intervals with either packed red cells (Group 1) or leukocyte-poor red cells (Group 2) until they were transplanted. Actuarial graft and patient survival were identical for graft recipients in both groups. Although the likelihood of receiving a graft was associated with the level of pretransplant sensitization to leukocyte (HLA) antigens (p less than 0.02) as measured by the percent of panel reactive antibody (PRA), it was not associated with the type of blood used. The highest mean peak reactive PRA level for all patients showed a low but significant increase (29 +/- 4 versus 43 +/- 5%; p less than 0.0005) following entry into the transfusion protocol, but the rate of increase was the same for patients in both treatment groups. The likelihood of receiving a transplant was primarily associated with a history of prior graft rejection (p less than 0.05), and patients with prior graft loss had the greatest increase in sensitization following entry into the transfusion protocol. These findings indicate that using leukocyte-poor red cells for pretransplant transfusions provided no added benefit when compared with packed red cells in terms of patient sensitization, the likelihood of receiving a transplant, or eventual graft survival."

The present study examines the clinical use of red cell concentrate (RCC) from 0.5 CPD-A2 blood donations. Forty-nine patients who were undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery and who required blood transfusion received 0.5 CPD-A2 RCC. A transfused control group of 107 patients received standard CPD-A1 RCC for their transfusion requirements. Patients in the two transfused groups had similar haemoglobin responses to transfusion. All patients experienced a moderate pyrexia following the operation. Both study groups showed similar responses to serum lactate dehydrogenase levels in the 2 weeks following surgery, and in postoperative peripheral blood platelet counts. Serious postoperative complications arose in both groups. In the 0.5 CPD-A2 group two patients had pulmonary emboli (one fatal) and one patient had a non-fatal myocardial infarction. Three patients had pulmonary emboli in the CPD-A1 transfused group. These incidences of major adverse events were within the expected range of these complications in patients who were undergoing major joint replacement surgery and did not differ significantly between the study groups.

The ratio of intraoperative RBC transfusion to blood loss was computed, and patients grouped by the median into a liberal transfusion practice (ratio equal to or above the median) and a restrictive transfusion practice group (ratio below the median).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Surgical site infection occurred in 27% of patients in the liberal group vs. 20% of patients in the restrictive group with an OR of 1·5 [95% CI: 0·8-2·9] (P=0·18) and an OR of 1·2 [95% CI: 0·5-2·9] (P=0·73) when adjusting for known confounding variables. Pneumonia occurred in 14% vs. 8% in the liberal and restrictive group, respectively (adjusted P=0·07), and admission to the intensive care unit was 15% vs. 7%, respectively (adjusted P=0·02), but no other significant differences were found.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A liberal transfusion practice was not significantly associated with postoperative complications, but pneumonia tended to be more common in the liberal group, which was more often admitted to the intensive care unit."

The adverse effects of blood transfusion are well documented. Retransfusion of shed mediastinal blood reduces the requirement for HBTs during conventional coronary artery bypass grafting. However, some studies have found that autotransfusion leads to bleeding diathesis and paradoxical increase in blood transfusions. Through this prospective randomized trial, we have studied the safety and efficacy of this modality in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB). Fifty patients enrolled in the study and 49 fulfilled the study criteria. They were randomly divided into group C (cell saver) and group N (non-cell saver). Whereas the cell saver group received processed shed autologous blood and homologous blood if necessary, the non-saver group was transfused homologous blood only. The threshold for transfusion was haemoglobin of 9 g dL(-1) in both the groups. The cell saver group required significantly less number of HBTs (1.6 +/- 1.2 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.3 units). The incidence of re-exploration was zero in both the groups. The mean mediastinal drainage in both the groups was not significantly different (355 +/- 196 vs. 316 +/- 119.8 mL). The number of patients requiring any blood transfusion however was very high. All the patients in the non-saver group and 20 (83%) of the patients in the saver group received homologous blood.

The periprocedural management of their anticoagulation presents a dilemma to physicians, particularly in the subset of patients with moderate-to-high risk of arterial thromboembolic events. Physicians have responded by treating patients with bridging anticoagulation while oral anticoagulation is temporarily discontinued. However, there are a number of downsides to bridging anticoagulation around device surgery; there is a substantial risk of significant device pocket hematoma with important clinical sequelae; bridging anticoagulation may lead to more arterial thromboembolic events and bridging anticoagulation is expensive.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      In response to these issues, a number of centers have explored the option of performing device surgery without cessation of oral anticoagulation.

Although anticoagulants factors are decreased as well, blood loss during orthotopic liver transplantation can still be excessive. Blood loss during orthotopic liver transplantation is currently managed by transfusion of red blood cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, fresh frozen plasma, and fibrinogen concentrate. Transfusion of these products may paradoxically result in an increased bleeding tendency due to aggravated portal hypertension. The hemostatic effect of these products may therefore be overshadowed by bleeding complications due to volume overload.In contrast to these transfusion products, prothrombin complex concentrate is a low-volume highly purified concentrate, containing the four vitamin K dependent coagulation factors. Previous studies have suggested that administration of prothrombin complex concentrate is an effective method to normalize a prolonged prothrombin time in patients with liver cirrhosis. We aim to investigate whether the pre-operative administration of prothrombin complex concentrate in patients undergoing liver transplantation for end-stage liver cirrhosis, is a safe and effective method to reduce perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This is a double blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized trial.Cirrhotic patients with a prolonged INR (≥1.5) undergoing liver transplantation will be randomized between placebo or prothrombin complex concentrate administration prior to surgery.

Prothrombin complex concentrate is a low-volume plasma product that contains both procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins and transfusion will not affect the volume status prior to the surgical procedure. We hypothesize that administration of prothrombin complex concentrate will result in a reduction of perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements. Theoretically, the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate may be associated with a higher risk of thromboembolic complications. Therefore, thromboembolic complications are an important secondary endpoint and the occurrence of this type of complication will be closely monitored during the study.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      The trial is registered at http://www.trialregister.nl with number NTR3174.

Significant differences in rates of clinical transfusion reactions and laboratory abnormalities were rare and had no apparent clinical importance, regardless of whether RBCs were donated by biologic parents or unrelated donors.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      A single-donor system, in which AS-3 RBCs were collected either from unrelated blood donors or from biologic parents and then stored up to 42 days, was able to supply small-volume RBC transfusions needed by individual preterm infants without immediate, adverse effects. Because the risk of infectious disease transmission is likely reduced by limiting donor exposure, it is logical to conclude that single-donor programs should increase transfusion safety and that biologic parents should be considered as blood donors for their infants."

            "abstract": "The hypothesis for this study is that weaning to an extensively hydrolyzed infant formula will decrease the incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), as it does in all relevant animal models for the disease. This will be tested in children who carry risk-associated human leukocyte antigen genotypes and have a first-degree relative with T1D. The trial will use a double-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled intervention protocol, comparing casein hydrolysate with a conventional cow's milk (CM)-based formula. A secondary aim is to determine relationships between CM antibodies, a measure of CM exposure, and diabetes-associated autoantibodies. To achieve an 80% power for the detection of a 40% intervention-induced difference in the development of autoantibodies and subsequent diabetes, the study requires 2032 subjects. A multicenter, international, collaborative effort is necessary to achieve recruitment targets. A collaborative international study group of 78 clinical centers in 15 countries has therefore been assembled for this purpose."

            "abstract": "Postoperative salvage autotransfusion of shed mediastinal blood, using the cardiotomy reservoir, is an inexpensive technique whose efficacy and safety are evaluated in this study. We randomized 75 consecutive patients into two groups. The autotransfusion group (n = 42) received autotransfusion after the completion of the coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) until the drainage was < or = 50 mL per hour for 2 consecutive hours. The control group (n = 33) was treated with standard chest drainage. Both groups received homologous blood transfusion when the hematocrit fell below 30%. Packed red cells were required post-operatively in 84.8% of the control group and 80.9% of the autotransfusion group (p = NS). Postoperative colloid fluid replacement (excluding autotransfusion fluid) did not differ significantly between the groups. The prothrombin time was significantly higher in the autotransfusion group 24 hours postoperatively (p = 0.03). The fibrin degradation products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). More febrile patients were seen in the autotransfusion group although not significantly more than the controls. The autotransfusion group received more red cells than the control group, but it lost more red cells in the mediastinal drains. In conclusion, the autotransfusion of shed mediastinal blood has not proved beneficial in reducing the postoperative requirements in homologous blood in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)."

This prospective study was designed to evaluate the effects of rHuEPO on regeneration of erythropoiesis after allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seventeen centers participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. The randomization was performed centrally for each center and stratified according to allogeneic or autologous BMT and major ABO-blood group incompatibility. One hundred and six patients received rHuEPO after allogeneic BMT and 109 patients received placebo. After autologous BMT, 57 patients were treated with rHuEPO and 57 with placebo. Patients received either 150 IU/kg/day C127 mouse-cell-derived rHuEPO or placebo as continuous intravenous infusion. Therapy started after bone marrow infusion and lasted until independence from erythrocyte transfusions for 7 consecutive days with stable hemoglobin levels > or = 9 g/100 mL or until day 41. After allogeneic BMT, the reticulocyte counts were significantly higher with rHuEPO from day 21 to day 42 after BMT.

A multivariate analysis (ANOVA) showed that acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), major ABO-blood group incompatibility, age greater than 35 years, and hemorrhage significantly increased the number of transfusions. However, after day 20, rHuEPO significantly reduced the number of erythrocyte transfusions in these patient groups, as well as reducing incompatibility in the major ABO-blood group. For the whole study period, rHuEPO reduced the transfusion requirements in GVHD III and IV from 18.4 +/- 8.6 to 8.5 +/- 6.8 U (P = .05). After autologous BMT, there was no difference in the time to independence from erythrocyte transfusions and in the regeneration of reticulocytes.

We assessed whether perioperative complication rates would be altered by preoperative transfusion.\n## METHODS\nWe did a multicentre, randomised trial. Eligible patients were aged at least 1 year, had haemoglobin SS or Sβ(0)thalassaemia sickle-cell-disease subtypes, and were scheduled for low-risk or medium-risk operations. Patients were randomly assigned no transfusion or transfusion no more than 10 days before surgery. The primary outcome was the proportion of clinically important complications between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis was by intention to treat.\n## FINDINGS\n67 (96%) of 70 enrolled patients-33 no preoperative transfusion and 34 preoperative transfusion-were assessed. 65 (97%) of 67 patients had the haemoglobin SS subtype and 54 (81%) were scheduled to undergo medium-risk surgery. 13 (39%) of 33 patients in the no-preoperative-transfusion group had clinically important complications, compared with five (15%) in the preoperative-transfusion group (p=0.023). Of these, 10 (30%) and one (3%), respectively, had serious adverse events. The unadjusted odds ratio of clinically important complications was 3.8 (95% CI 1.2-12.2, p=0.027). 10 (91%) of 11 serious adverse events were acute chest syndrome (nine in the no-preoperative-transfusion group and one in the preoperative-transfusion group). Duration of hospital stay and readmission rates did not differ between study groups.\n## INTERPRETATION\nPreoperative transfusion was associated with decreased perioperative complications in patients with sickle-cell disease in this trial. This approach could, therefore, be beneficial for patients with the haemoglobin SS subtype who are scheduled to undergo low-risk and medium-risk surgeries.\n## FUNDING\nNHS Blood and Transplant.\n"

            "abstract": "Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) have been shown to be effective in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after major orthopaedic surgery, such as total hip replacement (THR). The efficacy and safety of two LMWHs, reviparin and enoxaparin, were compared in a prospective, double-blind, double-dummy study involving 498 patients undergoing total hip replacement. Drugs were given preoperatively in doses of 4200 IU anti-Xa for reviparin and 40mg (approximately 4000 IU anti-Xa) for enoxaparin. The endpoint for the assessment of efficacy was venographically confirmed DVT. The endpoint for the assessment of safety was clinically important bleeding during study treatment. There were evaluable venograms for 460 patients (93%). Of these 460 patients only 416 fulfilled the study protocol. A total of 39 DVTs (9%) occurred in this per protocol group of patients, 21 (10%) in the reviparin group, and 18 (9%) in the enoxaparin group. The incidence of proximal DVT was 6% in each group. The two treatments were found to be equivalent in terms of efficacy. For the 460 patients with venograms (intent-to-treat) venous thrombosis occurred in 49 patients (11%). Of the 230 patients randomly assigned to reviparin, 27 had a DVT (12%), whereas 22 of the 230 enoxaparin patients (10%) had a DVT. The incidence of proximal DVT was 6% in both groups. Again, the two treatment groups were clinically equivalent in efficacy. Major bleeding complications occurred in two enoxaparin- and one reviparin-treated patient. Peri- and postoperative blood loss and blood transfusions were similar in both treatment groups. The reviparin-treated patients had fewer haematomas, bruisings and higher red cell counts and lower haemoglobin levels than the enoxaparin-treated patients."

            "abstract": "Stroke occurs in 7-8% of children with Sickle Cell Disease (Hb SS) and is a major cause of morbidity. Rates of recurrence have been reduced from 46-90% to less than 10% through chronic blood transfusions. Prevention of first stroke, however, would be preferable because even one stroke can cause irreversible brain injury. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound can detect arterial blood flow rates associated with subsequent stroke risk. By combining TCD screening and a potentially effective treatment, first stroke may be prevented. The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia (STOP) is the first stroke prevention trial in Hb SS and the first randomized, controlled use of transfusion in Hb SS. This multi-center trial is designed to test whether reducing sickle hemoglobin to 30% or less with periodic blood transfusions will reduce first-time stroke by at least 70% compared to standard care. Primary endpoints will be clinically evident symptoms of cerebral infarction with consistent findings on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Angiography (MRI/MRA) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Secondary endpoints will be asymptomatic brain lesions detected by MRI in brain areas not involved in primary endpoints. The design calls for a 6-month start-up interval, 18 months of TCD screening and randomization, and observation for stroke from entry through month 54. Key features of the trial are standardized TCD and MRI/MRA protocols interpreted blindly, and blinded adjudication of endpoints. The sample size (60 per treatment group) is based on prospective data relating TCD velocity to risk of stroke. A time-averaged mean velocity of > or = 200 cm/sec is associated with a 46% risk of cerebral infarction over 39 months. The sample size is sufficient to detect 70% reduction in the primary endpoint at 90% power. This trial will determine if transfusion is effective in the primary prevention of stroke. Secondary aims may further the understanding of the effects of transfusion on the brain and guide future research into cerebrovascular disease in Hb SS."

Subjects entered the study during inpatient treatment and were subsequently followed up for 12 months. Survival analysis disclosed essentially three categories of treatment response: one for noncompliant subjects (0% to 7% abstinent), one for compliant subjects not attaining therapeutic serum lithium levels (31% to 44% abstinent), and one for compliant subjects with therapeutic serum levels (67% abstinent). Two findings led us to believe that therapeutic serum levels of lithium were associated with better outcome over and above a behavioral compliance effect. First, in a dose-response analysis, serum lithium levels and abstinence rates were not linearly associated. Second, all subjects who started lithium carbonate therapy as inpatients were significantly less likely to relapse to drinking during the first month than were placebo-compliant subjects. There was no evidence that depressed alcoholics showed a better treatment response than nondepressed alcoholics or that lithium had any significant impact on the mood or social adjustment of alcoholics. Although the sample size and the difficulties of ascertaining placebo compliance caution against drawing firm conclusions, the data add further support to the hypothesis that lithium has an effect on drinking behavior not related to the treatment of affective symptoms."

In a prospective-randomised study to compare both methods regarding their efficiency, adverse effects, and economy, 20 patients of our department undergoing elective aortoiliac surgery received intraoperative autotransfusion by means of either cell-washing (CS) or salvage of whole blood (WB). Patients were preoperatively randomized into one of the two groups and were evaluated with respect to standard metabolic and haematological laboratory parameters preoperatively, during surgery, after transfer into the recovery room, 24 h after surgery, after transfer into the recovery room, 24 h after surgery, and at discharge. Both patient groups were well comparable in demographics, preoperative laboratory data, and indication for operation. Handling was easier, the set-up time was shorter with the whole blood filtration device (10.2 +/- 2.3 versus 21 +/- 1.9 min, p = 0.0023), and no additional personnel was needed to run the system. The whole blood device also allowed a greater percentage of aspirated blood to be returned intraoperatively compared to cell washing (73.5% +/- 7.2 versus 51.1% +/- 6.5, p = 0.03). Thrombocytopenia occurred in 7 (CS) and 3 (WB) patients intraoperatively with a significant difference in platelet count between the two groups (118 +/- 17 [CS] versus 170 +/- 12 [WB]*10(9)/L, p = 0.025).

As such, the optimum transfusion threshold after hip fracture surgery is unknown.\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nA total of 120 elderly, cognitively intact hip fracture patients admitted from their own home were randomly assigned to receive transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 10.0 g per dL (liberal) versus 8.0 g per dL (restrictive) in the entire perioperative period. Patients were treated according to a well-defined multimodal rehabilitation program. Primary outcome was postoperative functional mobility measured with the cumulated ambulation score (CAS).\n## RESULTS\nPatients in the liberal group received transfusions more frequently than those in the restrictive group (44 patients vs. 22 patients; p < 0.01) and received more transfusions during hospitalization (median, 2 units [interquartile range, 1-2] vs. 1 [1-2]; p < 0.0001).

Intra- and postoperative hemoglobin concentrations, transfusion and volume requirements were similar in both groups. 927 ml of plasma water were filtered during CPB within 4 min 20 s without hemodynamic changes or electrolyte imbalance. Hemoglobin and protein concentrations increased significantly during hemofiltration (Hb increases 3.6 g/dl). Hemolysis and activated complement fractions were elevated during CPB but showed no further increase during filtration; in contrast C4a, C5a, and prothrombin F1 + 2 increased significantly after cessation of CPB. In conclusion, hemofiltration during CPB is a safe and efficient method for water removal and for concentration of red blood cells and proteins without adverse effects on the patient's hemodynamics, blood quality, and volume requirements.

The intervention was decision support that provided dosing recommendations for targeted medications for patients aged 18 years and older when the patient's estimated creatinine clearance level was below the threshold for dosage adjustment. The primary outcome was the proportion of targeted medications that were excessively dosed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For 2,783 (46%) of the 6,015 patient visits, the decision support had sufficient information to estimate the patient's creatinine clearance level. The average age of these patients was 46 years, 1,768 (64%) were women, and 1,523 (55%) were black. Decision support was provided 73 times to physicians in the intervention group, who excessively dosed 31 (43%) prescriptions. In comparison, control physicians excessively dosed a significantly larger proportion of medications: 34 of 46, 74% (effect size=31%; 95% confidence interval 14% to 49%; P=.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Emergency physicians often prescribed excessive doses of medications that require dosage adjustment for renal impairment. Computerized physician order entry with decision support significantly reduced excessive dosing of targeted medications."

            "abstract": "The value of neurosurgical interventions after spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) is uncertain. We evaluated clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with SICH within 3 hours of symptom onset who underwent hematoma evacuation or external ventricular drainage (EVD) of the hematoma in the Factor Seven for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Trial (FAST). FAST was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between May 2005 and February 2007 at 122 sites in 22 countries. Neurosurgical procedures (hematoma evacuation and external ventricular drainage) performed at any point after hospital admission were prospectively recorded. Clinical outcomes evaluated were post-SICH disability, as assessed by the modified Rankin Scale; neurologic impairment, as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; and mortality at 90 days after SICH onset. The impact of neurosurgical procedures on clinical outcomes was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis, controlling for relevant baseline characteristics. Fifty-five of 821 patients underwent neurosurgery. Patients who underwent hematoma evacuation or EVD were on average younger, had greater baseline neurologic impairment, and lower levels of consciousness compared with patients who did not undergo neurosurgery. After adjusting for these differences and other relevant baseline characteristics, we found that neurosurgery was generally associated with unfavorable outcomes at day 90. Among the patients who underwent hematoma evacuation, those with lobar ICH had less ICH expansion than those with deep gray matter ICH, and the smaller expansion was associated with lower mortality. ICH volume was substantially decreased in patients who underwent hematoma evacuation between 24 and 72 hours after hospital admission, and this was associated with better clinical outcome. In conclusion, a small number of patients who underwent neurosurgery in FAST exhibited no overall clinical benefit from neurosurgical intervention, although outcomes varied by type of surgery, time of surgery, and hematoma location. Our findings support the need for further research into the value of neurosurgery in patients with SICH."

            "abstract": "The present study aimed to assess the influence of long-term therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) for 12 months on follitropin (FSH), lutropin (LH), testosterone (TE) and estradiol (E2) serum concentrations in hemodialyzed males with chronic renal failure. Two groups of hemodialyzed males with chronic renal failure were examined. The first one consisted of 20 male patients with uraemia and renal anaemia (haematocrit value < 28%). Eleven of them were treated with rHuEPO for 12 months in order to achieve and maintain a target haematocrit value (Hct) of 30-35% (EPO group). The remaining 9 male patients were only carefully monitored both clinically and biochemically (No-EPO group). Patients of both groups (EPO and No-EPO) were intensively supervised according to the same clinical and biochemical protocol. Before (0) and after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of the study, blood samples were withdrawn for the estimation of blood haemoglobin concentration, Hct, erythrocyte count, serum ferritin concentration, transferrin saturation and serum concentrations of FSH, LH, TE and E2. In patients of the EPO group a marked increase while of the No-EPO group, a slight, but statistically significant increase of the Hct value was found after 9 and 12 months and of E2 concentration after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of clinical monitoring. In contrast in patients of the EPO group a statistically significant decrease of serum FSH and LH concentrations (during the first 9 months of treatment) and an increase of serum TE and E2 concentrations was observed. From results obtained in this study the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. The degree of anaemia does influence significantly the hormonal profile of the pituitary-gonadal axis in haemodialyzed males with chronic renal failure. 2. rHuEPO therapy for 12 months does exert a significant, although transitory (confined to the first 6-9 months of therapy) suppressive effect on serum follitropin and lutropin levels but increases serum testosterone and estradiol levels in these patients. 3. Alterations of both haematological parameters and of hormone serum levels of the pituitary-gonadal axis observed in EPO treated patients do not seem to be due only to the administration of this hormone."

            "abstract": "In 1971 a prospective, randomized trial was initiated to determine efficacy of the distal splenorenal shunt in the management of cirrhotic patients who had previously bled from esophageal varices. When entry into the trial was terminated in 1976, 26 patients had received the distal splenorenal shunt (selective) and 29 had undergone a nonselective shunting procedure (18 interposition mesorenal, six interposition mesocaval, and five other nonselective shunts). Three operative deaths occurred in each group. Early postoperative angiography revealed preservation of hepatic portal perfusion in 14 of 16 selective patients (88%), but in only one of 20 nonselective patients (5%; p < .001). Quantitative measures of hepatic function (maximal rate of urea synthesis or MRUS and Child's score) were similar to preoperative values in the selective group but were significantly decreased in nonselective patients on the first postoperative evaluation (p < .001 for MRUS; p < .05 for Child's score). Eighty-seven per cent of selective and 81% of nonselective patients have now been followed for three to six years since surgery. Late postoperative evaluation of 29 survivors (12 selective, 17 nonselective) still shows an advantage to the selective group with respect to MRUS, Child's score, and incidence of hepatopetal portal blood flow, but differences are no longer statistically significant. However, if the seven patients with portal flow (five selective; two nonselective) are compared to the 20 with absent portal flow (seven selective; 13 nonselective), the former group has significantly higher values for MRUS (p < .05) and Child's score (p < .025). No patient with continuing portal perfusion has developed encephalopathy as compared to a 45% incidence of this complication in individuals without portal flow (p < .05). No significant differences between selective and nonselective groups have appeared with respect to total cumulative mortality (ten selective; 38%; eight nonselective, 28%), shunt occlusion (two selective, 10%; five nonselective, 18%), or recurrent variceal hemorrhage (one selective, 4%; two nonselective, 8%). Overall, significantly fewer selective patients have developed postoperative encephalopathy (three selective, 12%; 15 nonselective, 52%; p < .001). Therefore, we conclude that the distal splenorenal shunt, especially when its objective of maintaining hepatic portal perfusion is achieved, results in significantly less morbidity than nonselective shunting procedures."

Anti-fibrinolytic drugs are widely used, particularly in cardiac surgery, and previous reviews have found them to be effective in reducing blood loss, the need for transfusion, and the need for re-operation due to continued or recurrent bleeding. In the last few years questions have been raised regarding the comparative performance of the drugs. The safety of the most popular agent, aprotinin, has been challenged, and it was withdrawn from world markets in May 2008 because of concerns that it increased the risk of cardiovascular complications and death.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the comparative effects of the anti-fibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) on blood loss during surgery, the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and adverse events, particularly vascular occlusion, renal dysfunction, and death.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (July 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to July 2010, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to July 2010. References in identified trials and review articles were checked and trial authors were contacted to identify any additional studies. The searches were last updated in July 2010.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-fibrinolytic drugs in adults scheduled for non-urgent surgery. Eligible trials compared anti-fibrinolytic drugs with placebo (or no treatment), or with each other.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. This version of the review includes a sensitivity analysis excluding trials authored by Prof. Joachim Boldt.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      This review summarises data from 252 RCTs that recruited over 25,000 participants. Data from the head-to-head trials suggest an advantage of aprotinin over the lysine analogues TXA and EACA in terms of reducing perioperative blood loss, but the differences were small. Compared to control, aprotinin reduced the probability of requiring RBC transfusion by a relative 34% (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.72). The RR for RBC transfusion with TXA was 0.61 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.70) and was 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.99) with EACA. When the pooled estimates from the head-to-head trials of the two lysine analogues were combined and compared to aprotinin alone, aprotinin appeared more effective in reducing the need for RBC transfusion (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99).Aprotinin reduced the need for re-operation due to bleeding by a relative 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.62). This translates into an absolute risk reduction of 2% and a number needed-to-treat (NNT) of 50 (95% CI 33 to 100). A similar trend was seen with EACA (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99) but not TXA (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17). The blood transfusion data were heterogeneous and funnel plots indicate that trials of aprotinin and the lysine analogues may be subject to publication bias.When compared with no treatment aprotinin did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11), stroke (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.52), renal dysfunction (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54) or overall mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06). Similar trends were seen with the lysine analogues, but data were sparse. These data conflict with the results of recently published non-randomised studies, which found increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death with aprotinin. There are concerns about the adequacy of reporting of uncommon events in the small clinical trials included in this review.When aprotinin was compared directly with either, or both, of the two lysine analogues it resulted in a significant increase in the risk of death (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02, 1.89), and a non-significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.11 95% CI 0.82, 1.50). Most of the data contributing to this added risk came from a single study - the BART trial (2008).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Anti-fibrinolytic drugs provide worthwhile reductions in blood loss and the receipt of allogeneic red cell transfusion. Aprotinin appears to be slightly more effective than the lysine analogues in reducing blood loss and the receipt of blood transfusion. However, head to head comparisons show a lower risk of death with lysine analogues when compared with aprotinin. The lysine analogues are effective in reducing blood loss during and after surgery, and appear to be free of serious adverse effects."

One-hundred-eighty-one elective surgical patients were enrolled at 19 clinical sites from 1996 to 1998. Selection criteria included anticipated transfusion of 2-4 blood units, aortic repair, and major joint or abdomino-pelvic surgery. Once a decision to transfuse had been made, patients received initially up to 3 250-mL infusions of 10% DCLHb (n = 92) or 3 U of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) (n = 89). DCLHb was infused during a 36-h perioperative window. On the day of surgery, 58 of 92 (64%; confidence interval [CI], 54%-74%) DCLHb-treated patients received no allogeneic PRBC transfusions. On Day 1, this number was 44 of 92 (48%; CI, 37%-58%) and decreased further until Day 7, when it was 21 of 92 (23%; CI, 15%-33%).

We prospectively compared the effect of genotype-guided dosing with that of standard dosing on anticoagulation control in patients starting warfarin therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We conducted a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Genotyping for CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1 (-1639G→A) was performed with the use of a point-of-care test. For patients assigned to the genotype-guided group, warfarin doses were prescribed according to pharmacogenetic-based algorithms for the first 5 days. Patients in the control (standard dosing) group received a 3-day loading-dose regimen. After the initiation period, the treatment of all patients was managed according to routine clinical practice. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of time in the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0 for the international normalized ratio (INR) during the first 12 weeks after warfarin initiation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 455 patients were recruited, with 227 randomly assigned to the genotype-guided group and 228 assigned to the control group. The mean percentage of time in the therapeutic range was 67.4% in the genotype-guided group as compared with 60.3% in the control group (adjusted difference, 7.0 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 3.3 to 10.6; P<0.001). There were significantly fewer incidences of excessive anticoagulation (INR ≥4.0) in the genotype-guided group. The median time to reach a therapeutic INR was 21 days in the genotype-guided group as compared with 29 days in the control group (P<0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pharmacogenetic-based dosing was associated with a higher percentage of time in the therapeutic INR range than was standard dosing during the initiation of warfarin therapy.

The performance of WBC-reduction in RBCs, using varied filtration practices, in meeting the current FDA requirement (<5 x 10(6)), Council of Europe (EC) recommendation, the proposed FDA requirement (<1 x 10(6)), and a more stringent proposal (<5 x 10(5)) for residual WBCs per RBC unit was assessed and compared.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      Participating facilities were the 11 sites of the Viral Activation Transfusion Study (VATS), a prospective study of the impact of transfusion with and without WBC-reduction on survival and HIV viral load in HIV-1-infected patients.

The hypothesis of this study is that perioperative administration of celecoxib will improve analgesic efficacy, with a resultant improvement in short- and long-term clinical outcomes after TKA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied 200 patients undergoing elective TKA in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion. All patients underwent a similar perioperative anesthetic/analgesic procedure. After completion of surgery, patients were started on an epidural infusion with patient-controlled epidural analgesia. Patients were instructed to keep their numerical rating score pain < or = 3. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: celecoxib or placebo. The celecoxib group received celecoxib 100 mg orally twice a day 7 days before surgery. On the day of surgery, celecoxib 400 mg was administered 1-2 h before surgery and then 200 mg every 12 h for 10 postoperative days.

Definitive hemostasis was achieved in 29 patients in group A, and in 21 in group B (p less than 0.05). Seven patients in group A and 12 in group B underwent emergency surgery for persistent or recurrent bleeding (p = NS). Three patients from group B received endoscopic treatment owing to relative surgical contraindications. It was successful in all of them. Patients from group A needed a significantly lower number of units of packed red cells (p less than 0.05). Our results show that it is justified to employ endoscopic injection as the first therapeutic step in upper GI bleeding due to peptic gastroduodenal lesions."

            "abstract": "Part of the efficacy of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular events can be attributed to their blood pressure-lowering effect, but clinical trials primarily designed to investigate this effect are scarce. In a double-blind parallel placebo-controlled clinical trial with ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring, 79 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to 40 mg of simvastatin (n=40) or placebo (n=39) taken in the morning for 2 months. Between-group deltas of ABP change, adjusted for the corresponding baseline BP, were 2.8 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.4-5.1; P=0.02) for 24-h diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 4.2 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.1-8.4; P=0.04) for daytime systolic BP and 3.1 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.4-5.9; P=0.02) for daytime DBP. There was no effect on nighttime BP. There was an interaction between baseline cholesterol levels and treatment effect, which was restricted to patients with cholesterol above the median of the whole sample. There was no significant change in office BP. In conclusion, simvastatin lowers ABP in patients with hypertension, particularly in the presence of higher levels of cholesterol. This effect may contribute to the beneficial effects of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease."

Changes in self-reported dietary, physical activity, and psychosocial measures were significant. There were no significant differences in the physiological measures. Measurement error was generally low for all physiologic measures except skinfolds, indicating a high level of reliability. Across all sites, the coefficients of variation for lipids, height, and weight were less than 3%, whereas for skinfolds, they were considerably higher, ranging from 6 to 8%. Intraclass correlations for lipid studies were also uniformly high at 0.99. Interobserver agreement scores for SOFIT were greater than 90% for 9 of the 11 activities observed. Data entry error rates were low with less than five errors per 1,000 fields for all forms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The CATCH results provided more scientific evidence on the importance of schools in the population approach to health promotion. Many of the strategies used in this complex multicenter trial in the areas of design and analysis, measurement, training, data management, and quality control protocols might be appropriate for adoption in other studies."

Four patients received vidarabine on an open protocol, then ten additional patients were enrolled in a double-blind protocol. Among the nine patients who received vidarabine, no notable clinical improvement occurred in either the vidarabine- or placebo-treated groups. Thus, vidarabine showed no therapeutic effect in the treatment of CMV infections at the dosages used. Four patients showed dramatic CNS deterioration within several days of the onset of vidarabine therapy. Tremors and myoclonus were common, and one patient had unusual brain pathologic changes with widespread neuronal chromatolysis. The pathologic findings in the brain in the other three patients were complex and included intracerebral hemorrhage, Fabry's disease, coccidioidomycosis meningitis, and cerebral vascular occlusion. Thus, there was no conclusive proof that vidarabine contributed to the sudden neurologic deterioration of these patients."

            "abstract": "The immunosuppressive effect of extracorporeal irradiation of the blood (ECIB) in renal allotransplantation (RAT) has been investigated in a controlled clinical trial. A series of 101 uremic patients undergoing intermittent hemodialysis in preparation for RAT were allocated randomly to two groups; a treated group +ECIB (n=55), and a control group 0-ECIB (n= 46). ECIB treatment was given in the form of a fixed dose, with a transit dose of 400 rad and a cumulative dose of approximately 50 000 rad, both before and after RAT. A selective long-term lymphocytopenia was usually obtained, with no effect on immunoglobulins, complements or plasma proteins. Erythrocyte count was reduced in the majority of cases, but this had no limiting effect on the implementation of treatment. The shortest survival times and most deaths occurred in the +ECIB group. The first rejection episode occurred later in the +ECIB group, but there was no difference between the groups in the number of rejections during the first two months or during the whole observation period. There were more cases with two or more rejection episodes in the +ECIB than in the 0-ECIB group. There was no difference in graft survival, but shortest patient survival and most deaths after RAT occurred in the +ECIB group. It must therefore be concluded that the immunosuppressive effect of ECIB has no practical clinical relevance in RAT, and that ECIB given in the manner described involves the possibility of side-effects so serious that the method cannot be recommended."

An infusion of the drug in incremental doses (up to 12 ng kg-1 min-1) was begun before starting the ECC and was stopped at the end of the cardiopulmonary bypass, at the time of protamine injection. Significant arterial hypotension was observed during ECC in two patients of the Iloprost group. Comparison between Iloprost and placebo groups showed that the mean number of platelets was not significantly higher in the Iloprost group 20 min after the ECC and during the early post-operative recovery period. Platelet aggregability was higher after surgery in the Iloprost group than in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in post-bypass bleeding between the two groups. Thus, Iloprost does not reduce the fall in circulating platelets observed during cardiopulmonary bypass, but it might help in preserving the platelet function. However, the potential usefulness of the drug is limited by adverse haemodynamic reactions."

No infections occurred in either group, although the incidence of erythema and wound drainage at 2 weeks was higher for patients in the stainless steel group. One patient with metal staples had a postoperative hematoma requiring secondary irrigation and debridement. Patient satisfaction was higher with the resorbable staples. A resorbable subcuticular staple system can provide comparable wound closure to stainless steel staples following THA and may do so with less local discomfort, wound drainage, or erythematous reaction."

            "abstract": "We evaluated spleen function in 193 children with sickle cell anemia 8 to 18 months of age by (99m)Tc sulfur-colloid liver-spleen scan and correlated results with clinical and laboratory parameters, including 2 splenic biomarkers: pitted cell counts (PIT) and quantitative Howell-Jolly bodies (HJB) enumerated by flow cytometry. Loss of splenic function began before 12 months of age in 86% of infants in association with lower total or fetal hemoglobin and higher white blood cell or reticulocyte counts, reinforcing the need for early diagnosis and diligent preventive care. PIT and HJB correlated well with each other and liver-spleen scan results. Previously described biomarker threshold values did define patients with abnormal splenic function, but our data suggest that normal spleen function is better predicted by PIT of ≤1.2% or HJB ≤55/10(6) red blood cells and absent function by PIT ≥4.5% or HJB ≥665/10(6). HJB is methodologically advantageous compared with PIT, but both are valid biomarkers of splenic function. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00006400."

The number of patients who rebled was significantly lower in the sclerotherapy group than in the group treated conventionally (23% vs 53%). The number of bleeding episodes also was significantly lower in the sclerotherapy group (15 vs 32). Moreover, blood transfusion requirements were significantly decreased in the sclerotherapy group. This was true even for patients who were bleeding at the time of randomization or who were in Child's class C, but this primarily was because fewer patients who underwent sclerotherapy (10 of 24 vs 18 of 23) required transfusions.

The goal of this study was to determine if lowering the hemoglobin threshold for red cell (RBC) transfusion to 8 g per dL after coronary artery bypass graft surgery would reduce blood use without adversely affecting patient outcome.\n## STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS\nConsecutive patients (n = 428) undergoing elective primary coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: study patients (n = 212) received RBC transfusions in the postoperative period if the Hb level was < 8 g per dL or if predetermined clinical conditions required RBC support, and control patients (n = 216) were treated according to individual physician's orders (hemoglobin levels < 9 g/dL as the institutional guideline). Multiple demographic, procedure-related, transfusion, laboratory, and outcome data were analyzed. Questionnaires were administered for patient self-assessment of fatigue and anemia.\n## RESULTS\nPreoperative and operative clinical characteristics, as well as the intraoperative transfusion rate, were similar for both groups. There was a significant difference between the postoperative RBC transfusion rates in study (0.9 +/- 1.5 RBC units) and control (1.4 +/- 1.8 RBC units) groups (p = 0.005). There was no difference in clinical outcome, including morbidity and mortality rates, in the two groups; group scores for self-assessment of fatigue and anemia were also similar.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA lower Hb threshold of 8 g per dL does not adversely affect patient outcome.

However, methodologic problems and differences in study design limit the acceptance of the results and their relevance to other patient populations. Many of the trials were conducted in countries where, unlike the United States, the usual daily diet contained little calcium. Moreover, none of the trials has reported the outcome of systematic surveillance for urolithiasis, a potential complication of calcium supplementation. In response to the need for a thorough evaluation of the effects of calcium supplementation for the prevention of preeclampsia in the United States, the trial of Calcium for Preeclampsia Prevention (CPEP) was undertaken at five university medical centers. Healthy nulliparous patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 g supplemental calcium daily (n = 2295) or placebo (n = 2294) in a double-blind study.

We hypothesize that treatment with DFO could minimize neuronal injury and improve outcome in ICH patients. As a prelude to test this hypothesis, we conducted a Phase I, open-label study to determine the tolerability, safety, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DFO in patients with ICH. Intravenous infusions of DFO in doses up to 62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 6000 mg/day) were well-tolerated and did not seem to increase serious adverse events (SAEs) or mortality.

If we convert the analysis into a randomization analysis--where the one set of data is analyzed many times--once as though each acceptable assignment has been employed, we can eliminate any dependence of the analysis on statistical or probabilistic assumptions. To do this effectively when many assignments could be acceptable, we can go to double randomization, in which a subset, usefully kept balanced, of acceptable assignments is selected (perhaps randomly) before data acquisition. If we have one covariate, adjustment for which answers a question that is at least as appropriate, we can easily build on this. Imperfect covariance adjustments can help almost as much as perfect ones. If it is appropriate to work with many covariate(s), it is often desirable to first construct a (few) compound covariate(s) and then work with it (them). Often we can base the coefficients in our compound covariate on the univariate regressions of response on single covariates. Doing this within each arm of the trial and pooling keeps the fitting of the final adjustment unbiased. Since we can prespecify how the compounds are to be calculated and fitted, we can do all this while retaining rigid prespecification. Prespecification, randomization, and intelligent use of covariates combined to make the resulting significance analysis of platinum standard quality.

            "abstract": "The prognosis of out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is dismal. Recent reports indicate that high dose magnesium may improve survival. A prospective randomized double blind placebo controlled trial was conducted at the emergency department (ED) of Royal Perth Hospital, a University teaching hospital. Patients with OHCA of cardiac origin received either 5 g MgSO4 or placebo as first line drug therapy. The remainder of their management was standard advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Study endpoints were: (1) ECG rhythm 2 min after the trial drug; (2) return of spontaneous circulation; (3) survival to leave the ED; (4) survival to leave intensive care; and (5) survival to hospital discharge. Of 67 patients enrolled, 31 received magnesium and 36 placebo. There were no significant differences between groups for all criteria, except that there were significantly more arrests witnessed after arrival of EMS personnel in the magnesium group (11 or 35% vs 4 or 11%). Return of spontaneous circulation occurred in seven (23%) patients receiving magnesium and eight (22%) placebo. Four patients in each group survived to leave the ED and one from the magnesium group survived to hospital discharge. There were no survivors in the placebo group. In this study, the use of high dose magnesium as first line drug therapy for OHCA was not associated with a significantly improved survival. Early defibrillation remains the single most important treatment for ventricular fibrillation (VF). Further studies are required to evaluate the role of magnesium in cardiac and cerebral resuscitation."

            "abstract": "Critically ill patients receive an extraordinarily large number of blood transfusions. Between 40% and 50% of all patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) receive at least one allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) unit and average close to 5 U of RBCs during their ICU admission. RBC transfusion is not risk-free, and there is little evidence that \"routine\" transfusion of stored allogeneic RBCs is beneficial to critically ill patients. It is clear that most critically ill patients can tolerate hemoglobin levels as low as 7 g/dL, and therefore, a more conservative approach to RBC transfusion is warranted. Anemia of critical illness is a distinct clinical entity characterized by blunted erythropoietin (EPO) production and abnormalities in iron metabolism identical to what is commonly referred to as anemia of chronic disease. As such, the bone marrow in many of these patients responds to the administration of exogenous EPO, in spite of their underlying critical illness. The efficacy of perioperative recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been demonstrated in a variety of elective surgical settings. Similarly, in critically ill patients, rHuEPO therapy will also stimulate erythropoiesis. In randomized placebo-controlled trials, therapy with rHuEPO resulted in a significant reduction in allogeneic RBC transfusions. Strategies to increase the production of RBCs are complementary to other approaches to reduce blood loss in the ICU and decrease the transfusion threshold in the management of all critically ill patients."

In this report, we describe our experience in six patients, two who received a bolus administration of 10% DMSO and four who received a 20% solution titrated against the intracranial pressure (ICP). Five of the patients in this series suffered from severe head injury, and one had a cortical venous thrombosis associated with pregnancy. The first two patients were treated with a rapid infusion of a 10% solution of DMSO. Initially, the ICP was satisfactorily controlled using this method. Over time, however, fluid overload, severe electrolyte disturbances, and an ultimate loss of ICP control occurred. In subsequent patients, a 20% solution titrated against the ICP was used. Although ICP control was better achieved using this method of administration, problems with fluid management and electrolytes occurred again despite a high level of vigilance. In addition, because of the solvent properties of DMSO and its propensity over time to dissolve most standard intravenous infusion systems, mechanical difficulties in its administration were encountered in all six patients. The mechanism of action of DMSO is not well understood. It differs from the barbiturates, but acts too rapidly to function solely as a diuretic. The drug is extremely complex to use, and difficulties with its administration may make its risks ultimately greater than its potential benefits. Until more laboratory data are available concerning its use and better delivery systems are developed, neurosurgeons are cautioned against treating intracranial hypertension with DMSO."

However there is concern as to whether the rate of anticoagulant-related haemorrhage seen in these trials would be reproduced in a non-trial setting. Four hundred and ten consecutive patients attending a special anticoagulation clinic over one year were asked to complete a questionnaire concerning their warfarin treatment. The total number of years on warfarin was 2870. Of the 410 patients, 59 (14%) admitted to 88 bleeding episodes while on warfarin. Of these bleeding problems, 36/88 (41%) required admission to hospital or to casualty for treatment and 52/88 (59%) required only a lowering or temporary cessation of warfarin therapy. The calculated annual non-fatal bleeding rate of 3% in this survey is identical to that reported from the Copenhagen AFASAK trial. Similarly the 1.3% annual rate of major bleeding requiring attendance at hospital is identical to that in the Stroke Prevention in Non-Rheumatic Atrial Fibrillation trial.

Approximately 30 to 45% of patients have haemoglobin concentrations below population norms on admission, and around 10% are severely anaemic. Anaemia on admission, and in the postoperative period, is associated with poor outcomes with regard to mobility, postoperative mortality and readmission. There is currently no clear consensus on the optimal method of managing perioperative anaemia in this group of frail patients with frequent comorbidity. Liberal red cell transfusion in the postoperative period does not appear to improve outcome, whereas tranexamic acid appears to reduce transfusion rate at the expense of increased cardiovascular morbidity.

There was a trend in favour of rFVIIa in the number of participants transfused (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.01).

In prespecified subgroups, mortality/vasospasm-related morbidity was reduced in clazosentan-treated patients by 33% (8-51%) in poor WFNS (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons) grade (≥III) and 25% (5-41%) in patients with diffuse, thick SAH. Lung complications, anemia and hypotension occurred more frequently with clazosentan. Mortality (week 12) was 6% in both groups. The results showed that clazosentan nonsignificantly decreased mortality/vasospasm-related morbidity and nonsignificantly increased poor functional outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH undergoing surgical clipping."

On the other hand, processing of this blood by centrifugation and filtration removes coagulation factors and may potentially contribute to coagulopathy. We sought to evaluate the effects of cardiotomy blood processing on blood product use and neurocognitive functioning after cardiac surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Patients undergoing coronary and/or aortic valve surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized to receive unprocessed blood (control, n=134) or cardiotomy blood that had been processed by centrifugal washing and lipid filtration (treatment, n=132). Patients and treating physicians were blinded to treatment assignment. A strict transfusion protocol was followed. Blood transfusion data were analyzed using Poisson regression models. The treatment group received more intraoperative red blood cell transfusions (0.23+/-0.69 U versus 0.08+/-0.34 U, P=0.004). Both red blood cell and nonred blood cell blood product use was greater in the treatment group and postoperative bleeding was greater in the treatment group. Patients were monitored intraoperatively by transcranial Doppler and they underwent neuropsychometric testing before surgery and at 5 days and 3 months after surgery. There was no difference in the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in the 2 groups (relative risk: 1.16, 95% CI: 0.86 to 1.57 at 5 days postoperatively; relative risk: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.90 at 3 months).

Forty outpatients were randomized into group A (2 x 600 mg oral pentoxifylline per day) or group B (placebo). Both groups received the same exercise program in addition. The maximal and painfree walking distances and blood viscosity were measured. Intergroup differences in terms of blood viscosity reached the level of significance only after twelve weeks (p = 0.006 at shear rate of 94.5 s-1), but values of group A continuously decreased and those of group B continuously increased. After one and eight weeks, but not after twelve weeks, the maximal walking distances were significantly longer in group A than in group B. At no point were there significant intergroup differences in terms of painfree walking distance. The data suggest that pentoxifylline is clinically effective in claudicants even when given in addition to exercise. The benefit of drug plus physical therapy compared with exercise alone could be observed mainly in the first weeks of treatment and may wear off during long-term therapy."

A prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted to determine if hemodilution can serve as an alternative to preoperative autologous blood donation. Fifty patients were randomized to preoperatively deposit 3 units of autologous blood or to undergo hemodilution immediately before elective radical retropubic prostatectomy. All patients were treated under a standard protocol, including surgery performed by a single surgeon. The preoperative deposit groups received a mean of 2.44 +/- 1.0 units of blood; 2 of 25 patients required homologous blood transfusion for blood loss of 2600 mL and 1700 mL. The hemodilution group received a mean of 2.88 +/- 0.4 units of autologous blood: no hemodilution patient received homologous blood. At discharge, the mean hematocrit for the preoperative deposit group was 35.5 +/- 4.9 (0.35 +/- 0.05), and that for the hemodilution group was 31.8 +/- 4.7 (0.32 +/- 0.05) (p less than 0.001). There were no differences in perioperative morbidity in the treatment groups. The best predictor of discharge hematocrit was the initial hematocrit of the patient. It can be concluded that hemodilution can safely replace or at least augment preoperative autologous donations as a means of decreasing homologous blood transfusion in study patients. These results can be applied to any elective surgery procedure in which a 1000-mL blood loss is anticipated. Other advantages of hemodilution, including convenience, lower cost, and better preservation of all components of autologous blood, suggest that this practice deserves wider application."

Our aim was to assess whether methylprednisolone, when taken with IVIg, improves outcome when compared with IVIg alone.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, randomised study, to which we enrolled patients who were unable to walk independently and who had been treated within 14 days after onset of weakness with IVIg (0.4 g/kg bodyweight per day) for 5 days. We assigned 233 individuals to receive either intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg per day; n=116) or placebo (n=117) for 5 days within 48 h of administration of first dose of IVIg. Because age is an important prognostic factor, we split treatment groups into two age-groups-ie, younger than age 50 years, or 50 years and older. Our primary outcome was an improvement from baseline in GBS disability score of one or more grades 4 weeks after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      We analysed 225 patients. GBS disability scores increased by one grade or more in 68% (76 of 112) of patients in the methylprednisolone group and in 56% (63 of 113) of controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 0.97-2.88; p=0.06). After adjustment for age and degree of disability at entry, treatment OR was 1.89 (95% CI 1.07-3.35; p=0.03). Side-effects did not differ greatly between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      We noted no significant difference between treatment with methylprednisolone and IVIg and IVIg alone. Because of the relevance of prognostic factors and the limited side-effects of methylprednisolone, the potential importance of combination treatment with the drug and IVIg, however, warrants further investigation."

We designed a randomized controlled trial to determine whether routine cell salvage for elective uncomplicated cardiac surgery reduces blood transfusion and is cost effective in the setting of a rigorous transfusion protocol and routine administration of antifibrinolytics.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Two-hundred-thirteen patients presenting for first-time coronary artery bypass grafting and/or cardiac valve surgery were prospectively randomized to control or cell salvage groups.

            "abstract": "We undertook a prospective controlled clinical trial of 109 patients to determine whether postoperative blood salvage in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty decreased the need for transfusion with banked blood. The average amount of blood collected in our series was 493 ml, most of which was collected in the first four postoperative hours. In patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation. None of our patients developed adverse effects from the reinfused material. The cost of collecting and processing wound drainage using the Haemolite cell washer was $175 per patient, regardless of the volume processed, compared to $125 for a unit of banked blood. By reducing the requirement for homologous transfusion, blood salvage diminishes the risks of transmission of HIV and hepatitis viruses. In those cases where the equivalent of two units of blood are reinfused, blood salvage saves money. However, due to the small amounts of blood collected in unilateral hip or knee arthroplasty, we do not recommend its routine application in these cases."

We initiated this system in September 2003. In order to evaluate the availability of this system, we analyzed the clinical data during a one year period, based on the findings of patients showing panic values, mainly concerning the disease states and the correspondences by the doctors who were directly informed. We also carried out questionnaire surveys about the panic values and the new system for all of the doctors in our hospital (recovery rate: 84.3%). The total number of panic values reported was 113 and the mean percentage of the number of ordered examinations was 0.019%. After the report, 79 cases (69.9%) were examined again or treated, while 34 cases (30.1%) had already been treated or watched carefully at the time of the report. Malignant diseases were the main causes of increased panic values (38 cases), especially in the Na, K and blood glucose of patients. The next disease state, which appeared to demonstrate high rates, was chronic renal failure (16 cases), in the low K, high Ca, and low IP patients. Most of the cases of low Hb were caused from bleeding of the gastro-intestinal tract, with malignancies next. A blood infusion was performed for all of the cases with low Hb except for one. As a result of the questionnaire survey among the staff doctors, we confirmed that this system did indeed work efficiently, and 88% of the doctors who answered the questionnaires, were satisfied with the system. In conclusion, we established a new system, which made it possible for panic values to be directly reported to the doctor in charge and this system was then evaluated for its clinical usefulness."

At the start of the study, each of the 17 participating centers decided whether they would use a 10 x 10(9)/L prophylactic platelet transfusion trigger (group A/8 centers) or a 20 x 10(9)/L trigger (group B/9 centers). Bleeding complications (World Health Organization grade 2-4) during treatment cycles were comparable in the two groups: 20 of 110 (18%) in group A and 18 of 106 (17%) in group B (P = .8). Serious bleeding events (grade 3-4) were generally not related to the patient's platelet count but were the consequence of local lesions and plasma coagulation factor deficiencies due to sepsis. Eighty-six percent of the serious bleeding episodes occurred during induction chemotherapy. No patient died of a bleeding complication. There were no significant differences in the number of red blood cell transfusions administered between the two groups, but there were significant differences in the number of platelet transfusions administered per treatment cycle: pooled random donor platelet concentrates averaged 15.4 versus 25.4 (P < .01) and apheresis platelets averaged 3.0 versus 4.8 (P < .05) for group A versus group B, respectively.

            "abstract": "We conducted a prospective, randomized study to determine the efficacy of conjugated estrogen in reducing blood product transfusion during orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Patients undergoing OLT were included in the study. Only those having a reaction time of more than 30 mm or 15 min (19 -28 mm) on computed thromboelastography (CTEG) at the beginning of surgery were enrolled in the study. Patients were randomized to receive either conjugated estrogen (CE) or placebo. Every patient received a first dose of CE (100 mg i.v.) (20 mL) or placebo (20 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution) at the beginning of the procedure and a second dose of CE (100 mg i.v.) or 20 mL of placebo (20 mL of isotonic sodium chloride solution) just after reperfusion of the new graft. The two groups were similar in age, weight, requirement for veno-veno bypass, time on veno-veno bypass, CTEG measurement, and preoperative hemoglobin and platelet values. Blood products were given in relation to hematocrit and coagulation (CTEG) variables, which were measured every hour during the surgery. The amount of transfused blood products did not differ in terms of units of cryoprecipitate, but the intraoperative requirements for red blood cells (6 +/- 3 vs 9 +/- 6 U; P = 0.05), platelets (12 +/- 8 U vs 18 +/- 10 U; P = 0.05) and fresh-frozen plasma (3 +/- 3 U vs 6 +/- 4 U; P = 0.001) was significantly less in the estrogen group than in the control group. We conclude that CE is associated with a significant decrease in use of fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, and red blood cells during OLT.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      In this study, we prospectively investigated whether i.v. conjugated estrogen could decrease blood product transfusion during orthotopic liver transplantation. Conjugated estrogen-treated patients received less fresh-frozen plasma, red blood cells, and platelets. In this population of patients, conjugated estrogen can be a useful addition in coagulation management during orthotopic liver transplantation."

Seventy-eight patients were randomized to receive EPO and 74 received placebo during the first 12 wk. After this, placebo patients with hematocrit less than 32% entered the EPO maintenance phase along with the initial EPO patients. Hematocrit rose significantly in the EPO group from 23.8 to 32% after 6 wk, and this was sustained at 33.7% at 12 wk. In the placebo group, the prestudy hematocrit was 23.8% as well, and no significant change in hematocrit occurred over 12 wk. Concomitant with the rise in hematocrit, transfusion requirements fell only in the EPO group. Eighty-eight percent of patients receiving EPO had their anemia ameliorated by Week 12 of the study. There was a wide range of dosage requirements during the maintenance phase, ranging from 8,000 U thrice weekly to 4,000 U every other week. Adverse events after EPO were similar to those seen in hemodialysis patients given this agent, with hypertension developing or worsening in 55% of EPO patients during the initial 12 wk of therapy. Blood pressure was more likely to rise in patients with hypertension before receiving EPO. EPO is safe and effective in peritoneal dialysis patients, as it is in hemodialysis patients. Other than a rise in blood pressure, which is manageable with antihypertensives and ultrafiltration with dialysis, no serious side effects are seen. The optimal target hematocrit, effects of anemia improvement on quality of life, and end-organ (heart, brain) effects of anemia improvement in this patient population require further study."

In this review, the ISAT report was analyzed critically and the available literature was scrutinized stratifying the common criticisms as to the weak aspects of this study. The aim of ISAT was to compare the safety and efficacy of endovascular coiling with neurosurgical clipping for aneurysms, which were suitable for both treatments. The results showed a 22.5% relative and 6.9% absolute risk reduction at one year in the disability outcome of patients who were treated with coiling. However, long-term risk of re-bleeding from the treated aneurysms and the risk of repeat procedures was higher in this group also. Lack of angiographic data following the initial treatment and long-term follow-up represents one of the main flaws of this study. The outcome assessment scale, biases regarding patient selection and center participation criteria were further issues of criticism. The results of ISAT are not sufficient to provide a definitive answer as to the superiority of endovascular treatment over microsurgery, although coiling appears to produce less peri-procedural morbidity in a selected group of patients. An optimum outcome assessment should include a universally accepted scale and a detailed long-term angiographic outcome."

A total of 104 women were randomised into three groups: misoprostol group (28 patients); oxytocin group (37 patients) and control group (39 patients). Misoprostol and oxytocin significantly minimised the blood loss during the third stage of labour and reduced the need for additional treatments for PPH as compared with the control group. Oxytocin was more effective than misoprostol in minimising blood loss and the need for additional uterotonic treatments. However, a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, associated with tachycardia was observed in the oxytocin group. In conclusion, sublingual misoprostol appears to be less effective than i.m. oxytocin in the prevention of PPH; however, it has the potential advantages of being easily used, cost-effective and stable at room temperature.

The primary outcome was the rate of success, i.e. achieving the LPs (sampling or injection) at the first attempt, without bleeding (RBC < 50/mm3). The secondary outcomes included: the child's pain, assessed by a self-administered visual analogical scales (VAS) for children over 6 years of age; the parents' and caregivers' perception of the child's pain; the satisfaction of the children, the parents, the caregivers and the physician.

In the urgent colonoscopy group, 17 patients received endoscopic therapy; in the standard care group, 10 patients had angiographic hemostasis. There was no difference in outcomes among the two groups-including: mortality 2%versus 4%, hospital stay 5.8 versus 6.6 days, ICU stay 1.8 versus 2.4 days, transfusion requirements 4.2 versus 5 units, early rebleeding 22%versus 30%, surgery 14%versus 12%, or late rebleeding 16%versus 14% (mean follow-up of 62 and 58 months).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Although urgent colonoscopy identified a definite source of LGIB more often than a standard care algorithm based on angiography and expectant colonoscopy, the approaches are not significantly different with regard to important outcomes.

All three objectives can be represented by the same set of statistical hypotheses with the parameters defined differently. The various designs and statistical analysis procedures for active-controlled trials proposed in the literature can be group into two basic types: the historical-controlled trial approach and the cross-study comparison approach. These approaches require some unverifiable constancy assumptions. Under the constancy assumptions, the cross-study comparison uses the estimate effect of active-control treatment as the unbiased estimate of the active/placebo difference in the current noninferiority trial. A normalized Z-statistic is used to test the hypotheses. On the other hand, the historical controlled trial approach uses a conservative confidence limit as if it were a constant to replace the active/placebo difference in the current trial. The two approaches may lead to consistent conclusions only when the constancy assumptions can be supported by a large number of historical studies giving a consistent active-control treatment effect over placebo and that the active-control effect does not change over time."

Eight-week treatment phases were completed for both a placebo and L-carnitine. Outcome was measured by parents/caregivers and at medical follow-up using three established tools: the Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment, the Hand Apraxia Scale, and the Patient Well-Being Index. Analysis comparing change between baseline and week 8 of treatment for L-carnitine and the placebo showed that both parents/caregivers and medical follow-up detected improvements in the subjects' well-being. In addition, medical review showed an improvement on the Hand Apraxia Scale for a higher proportion of girls on L-carnitine. Identification of predictors of clinical improvement has been limited by the power of the study. These findings suggest that L-carnitine is of benefit in some patients with Rett syndrome. While L-carnitine did not lead to major functional changes in ability, the type of changes reported could still have a substantial impact on the girls and their families.

Compared to nonsmokers, smokers had significantly lower rates of mortality and major bleeding at 30 days and at 1 year; however, the differences were no longer significant after covariate adjustment. Smoking was associated with increased rates of definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST) at 1 year (adjusted RR 1.99, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 3.10) mainly because of a higher rate of late ST after paclitaxel-eluting stent implantation (1.9% vs 0.4%, p = 0.0006). In smokers bivalirudin monotherapy compared to UFH plus a GPI was associated with lower mortality at 30 days (0.5% vs 2.2%, p = 0.002) and at 1 year (1.8% vs 4.0%, p = 0.008).

In conclusion, in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention, smoking is an independent predictor of definite/probable ST at 1 year.

Measurements were performed before and after a packed RBC transfusion of 15 ml/kg, which was administered because the infant's haematocrit had fallen below the threshold defined by study protocol. Haemoglobin, haematocrit, RBC count, reticulocyte count, lactic acid and erythropoietin were measured before and after transfusion using standard methods. Cardiac output was measured by echocardiography. Oxygen consumption was determined using indirect calorimetry. Systemic oxygen transport and fractional oxygen extraction were calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Systemic oxygen transport rose in both groups following transfusion. Lactic acid was lower after transfusion in both groups. Oxygen consumption did not change significantly in either group. Cardiac output and fractional oxygen extraction fell after transfusion in the low haematocrit group only.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These study's results demonstrate no acute physiological benefit of transfusion in the high haematocrit group. The fall in cardiac output with transfusion in the low haematocrit group shows that these infants had increased their cardiac output to maintain adequate tissue oxygen delivery in response to anaemia and, therefore, may have benefitted from transfusion."

            "abstract": "This study, conducted for the UK Blood Transfusion Services (UKBTS), evaluated the clinical safety of red cells filtered through a CE-marked prion removal filter (P-Capt™). Patients requiring blood transfusion for elective procedures in nine UK hospitals were entered into a non-randomized open trial to assess development of red cell antibodies to standard red cell (RCC) or prion-filtered red cell concentrates (PF-RCC) at eight weeks and six months post-transfusion. Patients who received at least 1 unit of PF-RCC were compared with a control cohort given RCC only. About 917 PF-RCC and 1336 RCC units were transfused into 299 and 291 patients respectively. Twenty-six new red cell antibodies were detected post-transfusion in 10 patients in each arm, an overall alloimmunization rate of 4.4%. Neither the treatment arm [odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3, 2.5] nor number of units transfused (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.8, 1.1) had a significant effect on the proportion of patients who developed new alloantibodies. No pan-reactive antibodies or antibodies specifically against PF-RCC were detected. There was no difference in transfusion reactions between arms, and no novel transfusion-related adverse events clearly attributable to PF-RCC were seen. These data suggest that prion filtration of red cells does not reduce overall transfusion safety. This finding requires confirmation in large populations of transfused patients."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Concerns regarding the safety of transfused blood have led to the development of a range of interventions to minimise blood loss during major surgery. Anti-fibrinolytic drugs are widely used, particularly in cardiac surgery, and previous reviews have found them to be effective in reducing blood loss, the need for transfusion, and the need for re-operation due to continued or recurrent bleeding. In the last few years questions have been raised regarding the comparative performance of the drugs. The safety of the most popular agent, aprotinin, has been challenged, and it was withdrawn from world markets in May 2008 because of concerns that it increased the risk of cardiovascular complications and death.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the comparative effects of the anti-fibrinolytic drugs aprotinin, tranexamic acid (TXA), and epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) on blood loss during surgery, the need for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, and adverse events, particularly vascular occlusion, renal dysfunction, and death.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched: the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register (July 2010), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE (Ovid SP) 1950 to July 2010, EMBASE (Ovid SP) 1980 to July 2010. References in identified trials and review articles were checked and trial authors were contacted to identify any additional studies. The searches were last updated in July 2010.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of anti-fibrinolytic drugs in adults scheduled for non-urgent surgery. Eligible trials compared anti-fibrinolytic drugs with placebo (or no treatment), or with each other.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      This review summarises data from 252 RCTs that recruited over 25,000 participants. Data from the head-to-head trials suggest an advantage of aprotinin over the lysine analogues TXA and EACA in terms of reducing perioperative blood loss, but the differences were small. Compared to control, aprotinin reduced the probability of requiring RBC transfusion by a relative 34% (relative risk [RR] 0.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.72). The RR for RBC transfusion with TXA was 0.61 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.70) and was 0.81 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.99) with EACA. When the pooled estimates from the head-to-head trials of the two lysine analogues were combined and compared to aprotinin alone, aprotinin appeared more effective in reducing the need for RBC transfusion (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.81 to 0.99).Aprotinin reduced the need for re-operation due to bleeding by a relative 54% (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.62). This translates into an absolute risk reduction of 2% and a number needed-to-treat (NNT) of 50 (95% CI 33 to 100). A similar trend was seen with EACA (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.99) but not TXA (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.17). The blood transfusion data were heterogeneous and funnel plots indicate that trials of aprotinin and the lysine analogues may be subject to publication bias.When compared with no treatment aprotinin did not increase the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11), stroke (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.52), renal dysfunction (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.54) or overall mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.06). Similar trends were seen with the lysine analogues, but data were sparse. These data conflict with the results of recently published non-randomised studies, which found increased risk of cardiovascular complications and death with aprotinin. There are concerns about the adequacy of reporting of uncommon events in the small clinical trials included in this review.When aprotinin was compared directly with either, or both, of the two lysine analogues it resulted in a significant increase in the risk of death (RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.02, 1.89), and a non-significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 1.11 95% CI 0.82, 1.50). Most of the data contributing to this added risk came from a single study - the BART trial (2008).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Anti-fibrinolytic drugs provide worthwhile reductions in blood loss and the receipt of allogeneic red cell transfusion. Aprotinin appears to be slightly more effective than the lysine analogues in reducing blood loss and the receipt of blood transfusion. However, head to head comparisons show a lower risk of death with lysine analogues when compared with aprotinin. The lysine analogues are effective in reducing blood loss during and after surgery, and appear to be free of serious adverse effects."

Patients had major hemorrhage indicated by hematemesis or melena and evidence of significant blood loss. For entry, patients had to have endoscopic demonstration of active bleeding from esophageal varices or stigmata of recent hemorrhage and bright red blood in the gastric aspirate with no other source of bleeding found. Randomized patients received identical-appearing somatostatin or placebo for a 30-hr study period. Those given somatostatin received a 250-micrograms bolus and a 250-micrograms per hr infusion with repeat bolus and doubling of the infusion if the bleeding was not controlled. In retrospect, 18 patients could not be evaluated. Of the 84 evaluable patients, 48 received somatostatin and 36 placebo. They were comparable in age, gender, severity of liver disease and history of variceal bleeding. Transfusion requirements were similar in both groups. Bleeding stopped for 12 consecutive hr during 30 hr of the study period in 31 (65%) of the somatostatin group vs. 30 (83%) of the placebo group (p = 0.06). The median time to cessation of bleeding was 2 hr in the placebo group and 3 hr in the somatostatin group. Deaths following the study period were nine (25%) in the placebo group and 15 (31%) in the somatostatin group. Within the limitations of the present study, we conclude that somatostatin was ineffective in the management of active bleeding of esophageal varices."

            "abstract": "In retrospective studies, perioperative blood transfusions were associated with poor prognosis after surgery for cancer and were a major independent risk factor for postoperative bacterial infection. Leucocyte-depleted, in contrast to buffy-coat-depleted, blood has no immunosuppressive effects in transplantation and so might lack detrimental effects on cancer prognosis and postoperative infections. We studied this hypothesis in a controlled trial by randomly allocating patients to receive either leucocyte-depleted red cells or packed cells without buffy coat when blood was needed. Between 1987 and 1990, 871 eligible patients with colorectal cancer, including 697 patients operated upon with curative intent, were randomised in the 16 participating hospitals. Neither the eligible group nor the curative group showed significant differences between the two trial transfusions in survival, disease-free survival, cancer recurrence rates, or overall infection rates after an average follow-up of 36 months. Patients who had a curative resection and who received blood of any sort had a lower 3-year survival than non-transfused patients (69% vs 81%, p = 0.001) and a higher infection rate (39% vs 24%, p < 0.001). Colorectal cancer recurrence rates, however, were not influenced by blood transfusion (30% vs 26%, p = 0.22). These combined observations confirm the association between blood transfusion and poor patient survival but indicate that the relation is not due to promotion of cancer."

            "abstract": "A high-dose regimen of aprotinin 5-6 million KIU is effective in reducing bleeding and the need for homologous blood products (HBP) associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). These high doses aim at achieving plasmin and plasma kallikrein concentrations which in vitro are inhibitory but, theoretically, smaller doses could suffice in vivo. Also, aprotinin is an expensive drug, so efficiency requires using the smallest effective dose. Therefore, the efficacy of prophylactic aprotinin 1 million KIU (the maximal dose approved currently) was evaluated in a patient population at high risk of bleeding and of being transfused. Forty-one patients undergoing reoperation or a complex surgical procedure were included in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Before skin incision, a bolus of 200,000 KIU aprotinin was administered in 20 min, followed by an infusion of 100,000 KIU.hr-1 over eight hours. Control patients received an equal volume of saline. Dryness of the operative field, chest drainage, transfusion of HBP, haemoglobin concentrations, and coagulation variables (including bleeding time) were compared. There were no differences between aprotinin and placebo-treated patients for all clinical and laboratory variables. The apparent ineffectiveness of aprotinin may be explained by the use of an insufficient dose, by a different protocol of administration (e.g., no bolus in CPB prime), or by the inability of aprotinin to decrease bleeding and transfusions any further. Also, the number of patients studied does not exclude the possibility of a Type II error.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

IPE/WBE was initiated shortly after admission with a mixture of both fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate as the replacement solution. All IPE procedures were performed using a continuous flow system and a red cell prime. The mean fibrinogen level increased from 62 to 192 mg/dl, the prothrombin time (PT) decreased from a mean of 32.4 seconds to 15.1 seconds, and the mean activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) decreased from 89.5 seconds to 40.1 seconds following completion of the initial IPE/WBE. There was a corresponding improvement in all coagulation factor levels but only slight improvement in antithrombin III (ATIII) and protein C levels. Seven of eight patients survived (87.5%) their initial presentation with the sole early death attributed to meningitis with cerebral edema. Mean fluid balance after the procedure was +10.8 +/- 5.87 cc/kg. There were no significant bleeding or cardiovascular complications during the procedure. There was no clinical or radiographic evidence of fluid overload after the procedure. This experience demonstrates that IPE/WBE may be conducted safely in critically ill, unstable pediatric patients and is effective in rapidly improving coagulopathy without fluid overload."

One major complication was observed in the sclerotherapy group (aspiration) and two in the octreotide group (pulmonary oedema, severe paralytic ileus). During 60 days of follow up there was an overall trend towards an increased mortality in the octreotide group which was not statistically significant (relative risk of dying at 60 days 1.91, 95% CI 0.97 to 3.78, p = 0.06).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of this study indicate that intravenous octreotide is as effective as injection sclerotherapy in the control of acute variceal bleeding, but further controlled trials are necessary to evaluate the safety of this treatment."

Firstly, closing the defect by suturing the cavity walls together and secondly leaving the tumour bed open thus allowing seroma fluid to collect. There is debate regarding which technique is preferable, as it has been reported that a post-operative seroma increase post-operative infection rates and late normal tissue side effects.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Data from 648 patients who participated in the Cambridge Breast IMRT trial were used. Seromas were identified on axial CT images at the time of radiotherapy planning and graded as not visible/subtle or easily visible.

The first and most productive decade was characterized by case series, each with a small number of patients. These trials used nonstandardized clinical observation as outcomes and seldom had a comparison group. The crossover design became widely used to examine acute psychiatric treatments in the 1950s and 1960s. Although this strategy provided comparison data, it introduced problems in study implementation and interpretation. In 1962, the US Food and Drug Administration began to require \"substantial evidence of effectiveness from adequate and well-controlled studies.\" Subsequent decades saw remarkable advances in clinical trial design, assessment, and statistical analyses. Standardized instruments were developed and parallel groups, double-blinding, and placebo controls became the benchmark. Sample sizes increased and data analytic procedures were developed that could accommodate the problems of attrition. Randomized withdrawal designs were introduced in the 1970s to examine maintenance therapies. Ethical principles for research became codified in the United States at that time. A wave of regulatory approvals of novel antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants came in the 1980s and 1990s, each based on data from randomized double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trials. These trial designs often involved fixed-dose comparisons based, in part, on a greater appreciation that much of the benefit and harm in psychopharmacology was dose related.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite the progress in randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, the discovery of new mechanisms of action and blockbuster interventions has slowed during the past decade."

In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 208 patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery, subcutaneous administration of epoetin alfa (300 IU/kg daily) for 14 or 9 days perioperatively (commencing 10 and 5 days preoperatively, respectively) significantly reduced the incidence of primary outcome events (any allogeneic blood transfusion or a postoperative hemoglobin [Hb] level < 8.0 g/dL) compared with placebo (P = .003). Furthermore, the transfusion requirements of epoetin alfa-treated patients were significantly lower than those of patients treated with placebo (P = .007). Preoperative and postoperative Hb levels and reticulocyte counts were higher in epoetin alfa-treated patients compared with placebo. Epoetin alfa was well tolerated, and the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was not different from that observed in placebo recipients. Thus, perioperative administration of epoetin alfa reduces the allogeneic blood requirements of patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery and is of particular benefit in the subgroup of patients whose baseline Hb levels are less than 13.5 g/dL."

Drain clamping is a popular method that is applied to reduce blood loss after TKA. However, the clamping protocol remains controversial. Therefore, we established a new protocol, 3-h interval clamping, and compared the bleeding control efficacy of this protocol following TKA with the non-clamping technique.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between March and July 2008, we enrolled 100 patients (100 knees) who underwent uncomplicated TKA using a minimally invasive surgical technique. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups based on the draining protocol: non-clamping (group A) and 3-h interval clamping (group B). For group A, a vacuum drain was connected to a container and was run continuously during the first postoperative day, whereas the vacuum was stopped twice (for ~3 h each time) for group B. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected, including the levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit, the total blood loss volume, the number of patients who required a blood transfusion, and any complications that developed. The perioperative data were compared between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The drainage blood volume in the interval-clamping group (group B) was significantly lower than that in the non-clamping group (group A) during the first 48 h following the procedure (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005 for first and second postoperative days, respectively). The mean fall in hemoglobin levels at 12 h in the interval-clamping group (2.8 ± 0.9 g/dL) was also lower than in the non-clamping group (3.2 ± 0.8 g/dL). In the 3-h interval clamping protocol, the number of patients requiring a transfusion was 2.2 times less than the number in the non-clamping protocol, but was not significantly different (odds ratio = 2.20, p = 0.24), and the significant predictor of blood transfusion was the preoperative hemoglobin level (odds ratio = 7.73, p < 0.001).

Several studies have suggested that the coagulopathy could be corrected by substitution with a fibrinogen concentrate.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The aims of the present prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial were to investigate the hemostatic effect of a fibrinogen concentrate after coagulopathy induced by hydroxyethyl starch in patients experiencing sudden excessive bleeding during elective cystectomy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty patients were included. Blood loss was substituted 1:1 with HES 130/0.4. At a dilution level of 30%, patients were randomly selected for intra-operative administration of a fibrinogen concentrate or placebo. The primary endpoint was maximum clot firmness (MCF), as assessed by thromboelastometry. Secondary endpoints were blood loss and transfusion requirements, other thromboelastometry parameters, thrombin generation and platelet function.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Whole-blood MCF was significantly reduced after 30% dilution in vivo with HES. The placebo resulted in a further decline of the MCF, whereas randomized administration of fibrinogen significantly increased the MCF. Furthermore, only 2 out of 10 patients randomly chosen to receive fibrinogen substitution required postoperative red blood cell transfusions, compared with 8 out of 10 in the placebo group (P = 0.023). Platelet function and thrombin generation were reduced after 30% hemodilution in vivo, and fibrinogen administration caused no significant changes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      During cystectomy, fluid resuscitation with HES 130/0.4 during sudden excessive bleeding induces coagulopathy that shows reduced whole-blood maximum clot firmness. Randomized administration of fibrinogen concentrate significantly improved maximum clot firmness and reduced the requirement for postoperative transfusion."

These patients were randomized to receive up to three 250-ml infusions of DCLHb (n = 104) or three units of packed erythrocytes (pRBCs; n = 105). Further transfusions of pRBCs or whole blood were permitted, if indicated. Primary efficacy end points were the avoidance of blood transfusion through hospital discharge or 7 days postsurgery, whichever came first, and a reduction in the number of units of pRBCs transfused during this same time period. Various laboratory, physiologic, and hemodynamic parameters were monitored to define the safety and pharmacologic effect of DCLHb in this patient population.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During the period from the end of cardiopulmonary bypass surgery through postoperative day 7 or hospital discharge, 20 of 104 (19%) DCLHb recipients did not receive a transfusion of pRBCs compared with 100% of control patients (P < 0.05). The overall number of pRBCs administered during the 7-day postoperative period was not significantly different. Mortality was similar between the DCLHb (6 of 104 patients) and the control (8 of 105 patients) groups. Hypertension, jaundice/hyperbilirubinemia, increased serum glutamic oxalo-acetic transaminase, abnormal urine, and hematuria were reported more frequently in the DCLHb group, and there was one case of renal failure in each group. The hemodynamic effects of DCLHb included a consistent and slightly greater increase in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance with associated increases in systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures compared with pRBC. Cardiac output values decreased more in the DCLHb group patients after the first administration than the control group patients. At 24 h postinfusion, the plasma hemoglobin level was less than one half the maximal level for any amount of DCLHb infused.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Administration of DCLHb allowed a significant number (19%) of cardiac surgery patients to avoid exposure to erythrocytes postoperatively."

Patients with acute coronary syndrome may benefit from higher hemoglobin levels.\n## METHODS\nWe performed a pilot trial in 110 patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable angina undergoing cardiac catheterization and a hemoglobin <10 g/dL. Patients in the liberal transfusion strategy received one or more units of blood to raise the hemoglobin level ≥10 g/dL. Patients in the restrictive transfusion strategy were permitted to receive blood for symptoms from anemia or for a hemoglobin <8 g/dL. The predefined primary outcome was the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unscheduled revascularization 30 days post randomization.\n## RESULTS\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups except age (liberal, 67.3; restrictive, 74.3). The mean number of units transfused was 1.6 in the liberal group and 0.6 in the restrictive group. The primary outcome occurred in 6 patients (10.9%) in the liberal group and 14 (25.5%) in the restrictive group (risk difference = 15.0%; 95% confidence interval of difference 0.7% to 29.3%; P = .054 and adjusted for age P = .076). Death at 30 days was less frequent in liberal group (n = 1, 1.8%) compared to restrictive group (n = 7, 13.0%; P = .032).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe liberal transfusion strategy was associated with a trend for fewer major cardiac events and deaths than a more restrictive strategy. These results support the feasibility of and the need for a definitive trial.\n"

Serial hemodynamic measurements and blood samples were obtained before, during and after the CPB procedure. During CPB, there were no differences between both groups in the need for vasopressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine), urinary output, or fluid balance. In the early postoperative period, normothermic CPB patients had significantly lower systemic vascular resistance and higher cardiac index measurements (mean +/- standard error: systemic vascular resistance, 880 +/- 27 versus 1,060 +/- 57 dyne.s.cm-5, p = 0.025; cardiac index, 3.6 +/- 0.1 versus 2.9 +/- 0.1 L.min-1.m-2, p = 0.01) without differences in the administration of vasoactive drugs. Blood loss was significantly higher in patients after hypothermic CPB (median [range] body surface area: 370 [180-560] versus 490 [280-2,120] mL/m2, p = 0.0006), with a greater need for transfusion of erythrocytes and fresh frozen plasma. Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors increased during and after CPB, independent of perfusion temperature. This study suggests a significant influence of CPB temperature and respective perfusion management on postoperative hemodynamics and blood loss.

Poor results of conventional treatment and shunt surgery led us to evaluate injection sclerotherapy, using fibreoptic endoscopy. In a controlled trial, 108 patients were randomly allocated to injection sclerotherapy or to conventional treatment (medical measures, with modified splenectomy and oesophagogastric devascularization in selected cases). We report the results in the first 108 patients, with a follow-up of 1-35 months. Fifty-three patients received injection sclerotherapy; 5 died (2 of recurrent bleeding) and 5 others had recurrent bleeding but were controlled by further injections. Thirty-six of the 55 control patients underwent surgery; 5 died (2 of recurrent bleeding) and 2 others developed recurrent bleeding. Further bleeding occurred in 12 of the 19 patients who were managed by medical measures alone, with 7 dying. These early results indicate that injection sclerotherapy can be effective in urgent and elective situations and that it appears to have advantages over conventional medical and surgical treatments."

            "abstract": "Medicare regulations and the guidelines of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations require assessment of the appropriateness of transfusions by a hospital committee. A set of criteria maps for component transfusion review by nurses or technical personnel was designed, tested, and modified. The algorithms were based on written guidelines developed by a group of physicians. In the first part of the study, 196 medical records of patients from medical and surgical diagnosis-related groups with the highest utilization of blood (Group I) were screened. Forty patients were excluded because of a preexisting transfusion protocol. Of the remaining 156 patients, 146 (94%) received red cell transfusions, of which 96 percent were indicated, 1 percent not indicated, and 3 percent controversial. Thirty-five patients (22%) received fresh-frozen plasma transfusions, of which 69 percent were indicated, 11 percent not indicated, 17 percent controversial, and 6 percent indeterminate. In the second part of the study, medical records were screened from 99 randomly selected patients who had received red cell transfusions (Group II), and the results were similar to those in Group I. Physician review was necessary in 20 percent of the transfused patients screened with the criteria maps. It is concluded that algorithms for transfusion review can be developed and used easily to fulfill regulatory and accreditation requirements and to plan focused educational programs."

However, the rates were significantly lower with the restrictive transfusion strategy among patients who were less acutely ill -- those with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of < or =20 (8.7 percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 16.1 percent in the liberal-strategy group; P=0.03) -- and among patients who were less than 55 years of age (5.7 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively; P=0.02), but not among patients with clinically significant cardiac disease (20.5 percent and 22.9 percent, respectively; P=0.69). The mortality rate during hospitalization was significantly lower in the restrictive-strategy group (22.3 percent vs. 28.1 percent, P=0.05).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA restrictive strategy of red-cell transfusion is at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy in critically ill patients, with the possible exception of patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.\n"

            "abstract": "The majority of intracerebral haemorrhage patients present with markedly elevated blood pressure immediately after symptom onset. Management of blood pressure in the first 24 h is extremely controversial and lends itself to two competing rationales. There is some evidence that early treatment may improve outcome, potentially by reducing the rate of haematoma expansion. It is also possible that this will reduce cerebral blood flow and therefore exacerbate the cerebral injury, particularly in the region surrounding the haematoma. Only a trial that includes both randomisation of patients to two different blood pressure management strategies and actual measurement of cerebral blood flow can effectively address this pressing debate. This is the only unequivocal way to demonstrate the haemodynamic effects of rapid blood pressure reduction. The Intracerebral Haemorrhage Acutely Decreasing Arterial Pressure Trial is designed to test the hypothesis that blood pressure reduction does not result in significant or harmful changes in cerebral blood flow in acute intracerebral haemorrhage. Two hours after randomisation to a systolic blood pressure target of <150 or <180 mmHg, cerebral blood flow is measured using computed tomography perfusion, which is the primary end-point of the trial. A study of this type is critical to establishing the safety of early blood pressure treatment and is necessary for planning larger efficacy trials in a rational manner. This trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00963976)."

Eculizumab inhibits terminal complement-mediated PNH RBC destruction by targeting C5. In the phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, TRIUMPH study, eculizumab reduced haemolysis, stabilized haemoglobin levels, reduced transfusion requirements and improved fatigue in patients with PNH. Herein, we explored the effects of eculizumab on measures of anaemia in patients from the TRIUMPH study and the open-label SHEPHERD study, a more heterogeneous population. Eculizumab reduced haemolysis regardless of pretreatment transfusion requirements and regardless of whether or not patients became transfusion-dependent during treatment (P < 0.001). Reduction in haemolysis was associated with increased PNH RBC counts (P < 0.001) while reticulocyte counts remained elevated. Eculizumab-treated patients demonstrated significantly higher levels of haemoglobin as compared with placebo in TRIUMPH and relative to baseline levels in SHEPHERD (P < 0.001 for each study). Eculizumab lowered transfusion requirement across multiple pretreatment transfusion strata and eliminated transfusion support in a majority of both TRIUMPH and SHEPHERD patients (P < 0.001). Patients who required some transfusion support during treatment with eculizumab showed a reduction in haemolysis and transfusion requirements and an improvement in fatigue.

Traditionally, patients have been placed supine, with the head of the bed (HOB) flat. This study sought to explore the influence of three different post-procedure positions on the incidence of complications and patient perceptions of satisfaction. Sixty-nine patients were randomized into three groups immediately after hemostasis of the arterial puncture site was achieved. Group 1 patients were placed supine with the HOB flat. Group 2 patients were placed on their sides, with the affected extremity straight. Group 3 patients were placed on their backs, with the HOB at 15-30 degrees. Endpoints included the presence of any complication (bleeding, hematoma formation or expansion, back pain and urinary retention) and patient comfort and satisfaction with the randomized position. Patients were asked prior to discharge to select the position they would have preferred post-procedure. Selection of an alternative position was felt to indicate dissatisfaction with the randomized position. Ten patients in Group 1, and nine patients in Group 2 and Group 3 experienced a complication (X2 = 3.682, df = 1, p = 0.05).

Unit concentration of potassium and infants' hematocrit value, K+ level, pH, and base excess were measured before and after transfusion. Compared with control infants, study infants had similar transfusion needs, but received blood from significantly fewer donors. The age of the blood received by study infants was significantly older and had a higher plasma K+ level. However, the change in infants' serum K+ levels before and after a transfusion was not significantly different in the two groups, and no adverse effects from transfusion of older blood were observed. We conclude that a protocol that allows use of an assigned unit of packed red blood cells preserved with citrate-phosphate-dextrose-adenine anticoagulant until its expiration date is safe, minimizes donor exposures, and meets the transfusion needs of low birth weight neonates."

Blood losses were calculated from determination of circulating blood volume and measurement of preoperative and postoperative hematocrit. Amount of colloids that could be administered was limited to 50 mL/kg. If additional fluids were required, balanced crystalloid solution was used. Anesthetic and surgical techniques were standardized. Both groups were similar with regard to demographic and intraoperative variables. Total study drug was 48.9 +/- 17.2 mL/kg in the HES group and 48.9 +/- 14.6 mL/kg in the GEL group. Total red blood cell loss was 544 +/- 305 mL in the HES group and 504 +/- 327 mL the GEL group. Measured blood losses were also similar in both groups (HES, 19.4 +/- 12.3 mL/kg; GEL, 19.2 +/- 14.5 mL/kg). Exposure to allogeneic blood product was comparable in both groups. In the conditions of the present study, HES 130/0.4 up to 50 mL/kg is a valuable alternative to modified fluid gelatin for plasma volume expansion during and after cardiac surgery."

Similarly, red blood cell count and hemoglobin were far more stable in the therapy group, which required fewer transfusions of red blood cells than did the placebo group (p < 0.05). There seemed to be a tendency toward a consumptive coagulation disorder in the placebo group as indicated by a decrease of fibrinogen levels, prothrombin time, and antithrombin III activity, and an increase of partial thromboplastin time.

Rates are escalating, with studies from the United States of America, the United Kingdom, China and the Republic of Ireland reporting rates between 20% and 25%. Operative morbidity includes haemorrhage, anaemia, blood transfusion and in severe cases, maternal death. The value of routine oxytocics in the third stage of vaginal birth has been well established and it has been assumed that these benefits apply to caesarean delivery as well. A slow bolus dose of oxytocin is recommended following delivery of the baby at caesarean section. Some clinicians use an additional infusion of oxytocin for a further period following the procedure. Intravenous oxytocin has a very short half-life (4-10 minutes) therefore the potential advantage of an oxytocin infusion is that it maintains uterine contractility throughout the surgical procedure and immediate postpartum period, when most primary haemorrhages occur. The few trials to date addressing the optimal approach to preventing haemorrhage at caesarean section have been under-powered to evaluate clinically important outcomes. There has been no trial to date comparing the use of an intravenous slow bolus of oxytocin versus an oxytocin bolus and infusion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and design:\n        \n      \n      A multi-centre randomised controlled trial is proposed.

This prospective, single-blinded, comparative trial randomized 52 patients with TBI or SAH to receive prophylactic LEV or fos-PHT.

The present prospective, randomized, clinical study analyzes the impact of HHD with 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 solution on the rate transfusion, laboratory parameters, and the incidence of complications as compared with those in the control group receiving no preoperative HHD.\n    \n\n\n          Material and methods:\n        \n      \n      80 patients who had undergone total prostatectomy or cystectomy were randomized into 2 groups. Before anesthesia, the HHD group (n=40) received 15 ml/kg of 6% HES 130/0.4 solution. In the HHD and control (n=40) groups, 6% HES 130/0.4 was intraintraoperatively infused in its maximum dose of 33 ml/kg according to the patients' needs. Indicationsf or blood transfusion trigger were Hb <5 g/dl or packed cell volume < 0.24. Laboratory parameters (Hb, PCV, platelets, prothrombin index, prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen, antithrombin III were measured before surgery, after HHD and 2, 24, and 48 hours after surgery. The mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), and central venous pressure (CVP) were determined before surgery, after HHD, and 2 hours postsurgery. Statistical measurements were made in all patients from the HHD and control groups, as well as in a subgroup, in which intraoperative blood loss was greater than 30% of the total blood volume (70 ml/kg body weight).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Demographic data and surgical techniques were similar in both groups. After HHD, CVP rose significantly. The changes in MBP and HR were statistically insignificant. There were no complications after HHD. Of the 40 HHD-group patents, 5 needed donor blood transfusion while in the control group blood was transfused to 10 of the 40 patients in the control group. Comparing both groups showed a lower need for blood transfusion in the HHD-group patients than in the controls (10 versus 24 packed red cells). The postoperative Hb values showed no difference between both groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Preoperative HHD in patients undergoing surgery with expected >30% blood loss leads to decreased needs for blood transfusion. The method is safe and easy-to-use."

            "abstract": "Platelet refractoriness arising from HLA alloimmunization is a serious complication of transfusion therapy. In a prospective randomized trial, white cell (WBC)-reduced blood components were compared to standard platelet and red cell concentrates with respect to alloimmunization, refractoriness, and platelet increments after transfusion. Sixteen of 31 adult acute leukemia patients received only WBC-reduced platelet concentrates (PCs) and red cells (RBCs), with fewer than 10(6) WBCs per unit. Fifteen control patients received standard blood components with a mean of 0.1 x 10(9) (PCs) and 1 x 10(9) (RBCs) WBCs per unit. Platelet loss during cotton-wool filtration averaged 14 percent (range, 3-32%) from fresh PCs and 24 percent (range, 9-62%) from stored PCs. Filtration did not change corrected increments (CI) measured after transfusion of fresh PCs. The Cl 1 hour after filtration of stored PCs diminished by 27 percent, but the difference was smaller after 18 hours, which suggests better survival of WBC-reduced platelets. The number of platelet units transfused did not differ in the two groups. No patient in the WBC-reduced group developed permanent platelet refractoriness; transient HLA antibodies of low titer developed in two patients. In the control group, one patient became refractory because of immunization and two developed transient HLA antibodies. It can be concluded that the reduction of WBCs in blood components can effectively prevent alloimmunization."

            "abstract": "The interim monitoring and final analysis of data arising from a clinical trial require an inferential method capable of convincing a broad group of potential consumers: doctors; patients; politicians; members of the media, and so on. While Bayesian methods offer a powerful and flexible analytic framework in this setting, this need to convince a diverse community necessitates a practical approach for studying and communicating the robustness of conclusions to the prior specification. In this paper we attempt to characterize the class of priors leading to a given decision (such as stopping the trial and rejecting the null hypothesis) conditional on the observed data. We evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of this procedure over a range of smoothness conditions on the prior class. First, we consider a non-parametric class of priors restricted only in that its elements must have certain prespecified quantiles. We then obtain more precise results by further restricting the prior class, first to a non-parametric class whose members are quasi-unimodal, then to a semi-parametric normal mixture class, and finally to the fully parametric normal family. We illustrate all of our comparisons with a dataset from an AIDS clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of the drug pyrimethamine and a placebo in preventing toxoplasmic encephalitis."

Positive agglutination reactions were observed only with RBC from 26 hospital patients; however, by the radiolabeled antiglobulin method, C3d was demonstrable on all RBC, but its amount varied widely among different subjects. A normal range for RBC-bound C3d was established. RBC-bound C3d levels were not related to the age (18-88 years) or sex of the subjects and remained unchanged over 9 months. Red blood cells taken into CPD had more RBC-bound C3d than cells taken into EDTA; cord RBC had less than adult RBC. In 39 percent of the hospital patients (excluding those with autoimmune hemolytic anemia) RBC-bound C3d was above the normal range and a good correlation was found between values obtained by the radiolabeled anti-antiglobulin method and by agglutination titration scores. There was a threshold level of RBC-bound C3d below which agglutination reactions were negative. Evaluation of RBC-bound C3d in health and disease is important for determining optimal characteristics of anticomplement antiglobulin reagents."

Significant differences in exercise blood lactate kinetics and heart rate were also observed. The lactate vs. exercise load curve shifted to the right and heart rate decreased, thus indicating an improvement of aerobic endurance. These results were associated with a significant increase in the ventilatory anaerobic threshold (p<0.05). Significant increases (p<0.05) in pulmonary ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory frequency, O2 uptake, CO2 output and ventilatory equivalents to oxygen (VE/Vo2) and carbon dioxide (VE/co2) were observed at the ventilatory threshold and within the transitional zone of the curves. We conclude that short-term intermittent exposure to moderate hypoxia, in combination with low-intensity exercise in a hypobaric chamber, is sufficient to improve aerobic capacity and to induce altitude acclimation."

Their results would be the ideal, rather than what might be expected during routine operation.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      To obtain information on routine filtration of blood components, data have been collected from a large-scale, ongoing, multicenter clinical trial designed to determine the effectiveness of WBC reduction in or ultraviolet B radiation of platelet concentrates before transfusion in preventing platelet alloimmunization and platelet transfusion refractoriness. The WBC content of blood components both before and after filtration was determined by automated cell counters and a manual propidium iodide-staining method, respectively. Platelet and red cell losses during filtration were measured.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The average platelet losses after filtration were 24 +/- 15 percent and 20 +/- 9 percent for apheresis platelets and pooled platelets, respectively. The frequencies at which filtered platelet concentrates contained high levels of residual WBCs (> 5 x 10(6)) were 7 percent and 5 percent for apheresis platelets and pooled platelets, respectively. Further analysis of the platelet filtration data showed that greater numbers of total initial WBCs in the pooled platelets were associated with increased percentages of filtration failure (> 5 x 10(6) residual WBCs). For packed red cells, the average losses during filtration were 23 +/- 4 percent and 15 +/- 3 percent for CPDA-1 units and Adsol units, respectively. The frequencies at which filtered red cells contained > 5 x 10(6) residual WBCs were 2.7 percent for one type of filter and 0.3 percent for another type of filter.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There were significant losses of platelets during filtration, which could add to the costs of WBC reduction and lead to possible increases in donor exposures. Filtration failures still occurred, despite careful observation of the standard filtration procedures. The number of total WBCs in pooled platelets before filtration has been identified as an important factor in determining the success of WBC reduction."

We analyzed the subgroup of patients with sepsis and transfusion requirements in a pediatric intensive care unit study to determine the impact of a restrictive vs. liberal transfusion strategy on clinical outcome.\n## DESIGN\nSubgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.\n## SETTING\nMulticenter pediatric critical care units.\n## PATIENTS\nStabilized critically ill children (mean systemic arterial pressure >2 sd below normal mean for age and cardiovascular support not increased for at least 2 hrs before enrollment) with a hemoglobin ≤ 9.5 g/dL within 7 days after pediatric critical care unit admission.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nOne hundred thirty-seven stabilized critically ill children with sepsis were randomized to receive red blood cell transfusion if their hemoglobin decreased to either <7.0 g/dL (restrictive group) or 9.5 g/dL (liberal group).\n## MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS\nIn the restrictive group (69 patients), 30 patients did not receive any red blood cell transfusion, whereas only one patient in the liberal group (68 patients) never underwent transfusion (p < .01). No clinically significant differences were found for the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p = .97), for pediatric critical care unit length of stay (p = .74), or for pediatric critical care unit mortality (p = .44) in the restrictive vs. liberal group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this subgroup analysis of children with stable sepsis, we found no evidence that a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy, as compared to a liberal one, increased the rate of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Furthermore, a restrictive transfusion threshold significantly reduced exposure to blood products. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe stabilized for children with sepsis, but further studies are required to support this recommendation.\n"

As a result, morbidity and mortality from cardiomyopathy are likely to increase for patients with generalized myopathies. One hundred consecutive patients with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy and a mean age of 17.2 yr (range, 5-41) satisfied criteria for having dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and received digitalis and diuretics. Nine of the 14 patients were symptom-free, despite left ventricular ejection fractions (LVEFs) of 25-40%. The five patients with symptomatic heart failure had severe ventricular dilatation, with LVEFs < 25%. Two of the five patients died of heart failure within 1 yr. For the remaining three patients, we evaluated the addition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril and, subsequently, the use of beta-blockers to the therapeutic regimen. Addition of these medications, never before attempted in the management of cardiomyopathy associated with generalized myopathic disease, complemented each other in relieving symptoms and reversing signs of congestive heart failure and DCM. We conclude that the combination of ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker deserves further exploration for inclusion in any management regimen for the treatment of muscular dystrophy-associated cardiomyopathy."

Within the framework of a screening programme for stomach cancer, 2200 subjects of 35-69 years of age have been recruited.

At the end of the treatment phase, the investigations performed at study entry will be repeated. Before the initiation of the trial, various pilot studies were carried out that showed an extremely high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection (over 90%). Two eradication trials using anti-H. pylori treatments that give good results in Europe and North America gave very poor results in our study population. The low eradication rates achieved (5-20%) suggest a high prevalence of antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains or high reinfection rates.

This anaemia results in symptoms such as fatigue, which may have major impact on the health-related quality of life. RBC transfusion is generally thought to alleviate these undesirable effects although it may cause transfusion reactions. Moreover, the postpartum haemoglobin level seems to influence fatigue only for a short period of time. At present, there are no strict transfusion criteria for this specific indication, resulting in a wide variation in postpartum policy of RBC transfusion in the Netherlands.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      The WOMB trial is a multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial. Women with acute anaemia due to postpartum haemorrhage, 12-24 hours after delivery and not initially treated with RBC transfusion, are eligible for randomisation. Patients with severe physical complaints are excluded. Patients are randomised for either RBC transfusion or expectant management. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed at inclusion, at three days and one, three and six weeks postpartum with three validated measures (Multi-dimensional Fatigue Inventory, ShortForm-36, EuroQol-5D). Primary outcome of the study is physical fatigue three days postpartum. Secondary outcome measures are general and mental fatigue scores and generic health related quality of life scores, the number of RBC transfusions, length of hospital stay, complications and health-care costs. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. The various longitudinal scores will be evaluated using Repeated Measurements ANOVA. A costs benefit analysis will also be performed. The power calculation is based on the exclusion of a difference in means of 1.3 points or greater in favour of RBC transfusion arm regarding physical fatigue subscale. With missing data not exceeding 20%, 250 patients per arm have to be randomised (one-sided alpha = 0.025, power = 80%).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study will provide evidence for a guideline regarding RBC transfusion in the postpartum patient suffering from acute anaemia.

Treatment was continued for the first 6 weeks of life. A total of 178 infants were studied. Vitamin E levels were significantly higher in a supplemented group by day 3 and for the remainder of the 6-week period. At 6 weeks of age, there was no significant difference between the supplemented and unsupplemented groups in hemoglobin concentration, reticulocyte and platelet counts, or erythrocyte morphology. It is concluded that there is no evidence to support a policy of administering vitamin E to premature infants to prevent the anemia of prematurity."

Several alternatives exist today, one of which, used for autologous blood salvage perioperatively, is the Sangvia Blood Management System. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of the system and to add data to previously reported safety results.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology/principal findings:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred sixteen patients undergoing primary or revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) were enrolled in this randomized, controlled, assessor-blinded multicenter study. Randomization was either autologous blood transfusion (Sangvia group) or no use of autologous blood (Control group), both in combination with a transfusion protocol for allogeneic transfusion. Patients were followed during hospital stay and at two months after discharge. The primary outcome was allogeneic blood transfusion frequency. Data on blood loss, postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit, safety and quality of life were also collected. The effectiveness analysis including all patients showed an allogeneic blood transfusion rate of 14% in both groups. The efficacy analysis included 197 patients and showed a transfusion rate of 9% in the Sangvia group as compared to 13% in the Control group (95%CI -0.05-0.12, p = 0.5016). A mean of 522 mL autologous blood was returned in the Sangvia group and lower calculated blood loss was seen. 1095 mL vs 1285 mL in the Control group (95%CI 31-346, p = 0.0175). No differences in postoperative hemoglobin was detected but a lower hematocrit reduction after surgery was seen among patients receiving autologous blood. No relevant differences were found for safety parameters or quality of life.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions/significance:\n        \n      \n      General low use of allogeneic blood in THA is seen in the current study of the Sangvia system used together with a transfusion protocol.

Efficacy of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in reducing childhood pneumonia has been estimated in four double-blind, randomized, controlled trials. An investigational 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (11PCV) had an efficacy of 22.9% against radiologically defined pneumonia during first 2 years of life in Filipino infants. We report here the immunogenicity of the vaccine in a nested study of 1111 infants randomized 1:1 to receive 11PCV or placebo scheduled to be given according to the National EPI Program at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      IgG antibody concentrations to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides were measured by a standardized enzyme immuno-assay in serum samples drawn post-3rd dose for peak antibody response and at the time of measles vaccination at 9 months of age for persistence of the antibodies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of antibodies were significantly higher in 11PCV than in placebo recipients against vaccine serotypes at both sampling points.

We hypothesised that restriction of parenteral fluids in comparison to a liberal fluid administration policy leads to less use of packed red cells in CABG operations supported by cell salvage. After consent and approval, 130 patients operated under equal conditions were assigned prospectively and randomly either for a restrictive protocol for intravenous fluid administration (group A, 65 pts) or not (group B, 65 pts). Transfusion guidelines were common for the two groups. The volumes of intravenous fluids, priming, \"extra\" volume on pump and cardioplegic solution and the volume of urine were recorded. Net erythrocyte volume loss was calculated. The number of the transfused PRC was analyzed as a continuous variable. \"Transfusion\" was analyzed as a categorical characteristic. Significant difference existed between groups for the fluids administered intravenously until the initiation of CPB and for fluid balance after CPB. Intraoperatively transfused units were significantly lower in A (0.32 +/- 0.77 vs 1.26 +/- 1.05 u/per pt; p<0.0001). Transfused patients were also significantly lower in A (11/65 vs 44/65; p<0.0001).

A total of 35,533 men were assigned randomly to one of the four treatment groups (vitamin E + placebo, selenium + placebo, vitamin E + selenium, and placebo + placebo).

            "abstract": "HLA immunization is a common complication of transfusion therapy in 30% to 60% of oncohematologic patients. Evidence shows that leukocytes present in cellular blood products are the main component involved in the occurrence of HLA immunization, and several studies showed that leukocyte-poor blood products are less able to induce it. However, leukocyte-poor platelet concentrates obtained by conventional techniques, ie, centrifugation, frequently have a high level of remaining leukocytes. Cotton wool filter Imugard IG 500 can be used to obtain leukocyte-poor cellular blood products. The technique is easy to perform, even in an emergency, and can be used with either packed RBCs or platelet concentrates. Means of 97%, 92%, and 76% elimination of leukocytes are obtained for packed RBCs, pooled standard platelet concentrates, and single-donor platelet concentrates, respectively. Patients were randomized to receive either standard (control group) or filtered (leukocyte-poor group) blood products. Of 112 randomized patients, 69 were evaluable, 35 in the control group and 34 in the leukocyte-poor group. Both groups are comparable according to age, diagnosis, sex ratio, previous transfusions, and pregnancies. There is a significant difference in regard to the HLA immunization rate (31.4% in the control v 11.7% in the leukocyte-poor group, P less than .05) and frequency of refractoriness to platelet transfusions (46.6% v 11.7%, P less than .05). We conclude that this filtration technique can be an efficient means to reduce the HLA immunization rate in polytransfused oncohematologic patients."

Oftentimes this population is mobile and does not receive consistent preventive care. This trial tested whether an intensive fluoride 5% sodium varnish regimen (three applications/2 weeks) applied annually has an equivalent effect on caries progression in the primary dentition compared to single applications applied semiannually. This study was a randomized clinical trial with two treatment groups. All participants (n = 600; mean age +/- SD = 55.3 +/- 4.6 months) received three varnish applications (active varnish or placebo) at semiannual visits over 3 years. Once per year the intensive-treatment group received one set of three active treatments and three placebo treatments 6 months later, each time within 2 weeks. The standard group received one active and two placebo treatments every 6 months. Children were assessed clinically at baseline and 12, 24 and 36 months after the initiation of the study. The mean (SD) numbers of newly decayed primary tooth surfaces observed over 3 years were 9.8 (8.6) and 7.4 (7.7) in the intensive and standard groups, respectively. The adjusted rate ratio was 1.13 (95% CI = 0.94-1.37, p = 0.20). In conclusion, the trial failed to demonstrate clear evidence of a difference in efficacy. However, differences of up to 36% greater rates of caries in the intensive group could not be ruled out, thus equivalence of the treatments cannot be concluded."

WBC depletion was produced by an additional centrifugation of pooled PC, with removal of 81% of WBC and an associated platelet loss of 27%. Lymphocytotoxic antibody (LCTAb) levels were monitored as a serologic marker of alloimmunization. Overall, 5 of 25 evaluable patients receiving WBC-depleted PC developed LCTAb, compared to 13/31 receiving standard PC (p = 0.071). There was no significant difference in alloimmunization rate in the subgroup of patients who had no previous exposure to histocompatibility antigens by pregnancy or prior transfusions (4/15 alloimmunized receiving WBC depleted versus 4/12 receiving standard PC). There was no difference in the number of patients in each group who required HLA-matched platelets during induction therapy. In view of the significant loss of platelets with WBC depletion, the expense and difficulty of providing WBC-poor RBC, the absence of impact on the need for HLA-matched platelets during induction, and the small potential benefit from this approach, WBC-depleted platelets should not be utilized to prevent alloimmunization in patients with leukemia."

However, repeated RBC transfusions are often complicated by RBC alloimmunization. To investigate whether the frequency of RBC alloimmunization could be accounted for by racial and RBC phenotype differences between donors and recipients in Brazil, in this study we compared the RBC phenotype of 100 SCD patients with that observed in 120 randomly selected blood donors. A comparison of the RBC phenotype between the two groups revealed a statistically significant increase in the frequency of the C antigen in the donor population (P < 0.01), but no significant difference was observed for the A,B,D,c,E,e,K,k,Fya,M,N,S,s, and Jka antigens. Using standard techniques (indirect antiglobulin test, enzyme treatment, and low-ionic-strength solution) we observed an RBC alloimmunization rate of 12.9% (11/85) in the SCD patients. Fifteen alloantibodies were detected in 11 patients, and most (80%) involved antigens in the Rhesus and Kell systems. This observed RBC alloimmunization rate in SCD patients in Brazil is lower than that reported by studies from North America, suggesting that the requirement for extended antigen-matched RBC transfusion for SCD patients in the setting of a RBC phenotype concordant donor-recipient population may not be cost-effective in some countries."

Parts of the Vacufix blood collection bags of group A contained bacteria, but none in group B. Processed red blood cell concentrates in both groups showed bacterial growth. Greater blood loss did not increase the contamination rate in general. Isolated bacteria included the species Staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Propionibacteria in both groups, but with different cell counts. In addition, Corynebacterium bovis et minutissimum and Moraxelle were identified in group A. In conclusion, autologous blood transfusion was a safe procedure. If contamination occurred, the bacterial count was low, and the bacteria of low pathogenicity. Antibiotic prophylaxis with cefuroxime reduced this contamination of suction tips and collection bags and limited the transfer of autologous blood products."

Considerable controversy remains regarding the optimal form of therapy. Between 1983 and 1989 we conducted a prospective randomized trial with three treatment strategies: best medical management, best medical management plus intracranial pressure monitoring, and surgical evacuation. Only patients with significant deficit harboring a putaminal hematoma at least 3.0 cm in diameter were entered. The study was interrupted after 21 patients had been studied (9, best medical management; 4, intracranial pressure monitoring; and 8, surgical evacuation). No differences were found among groups for age, admission blood pressure, and time interval between onset of symptoms and arrival at hospital. None of the subjects were capable of returning to prestroke activity. Fifteen (71%) died or remained vegetative at 6 months, and only 4 (19%) were capable of independent life at home. Of the 9 patients in the best medical management arm, 7 were dead or vegetative. In the surgical group, 4 patients died and only 2 were capable of independent life. These results suggest that current medical and neurosurgical therapies remain ineffective in preventing the devastating neurologic consequences of hypertensive putaminal hemorrhage."

            "abstract": "Blood stem cell transplantation (BSCT) results in rapid hematopoietic recovery in both the allogeneic and autologous transplant settings. Because of the large numbers of progenitor cells in mobilized blood, the administration of growth factors after transplantation may not provide further acceleration of hematopoietic recovery. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed to determine the effects of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor; G-CSF) administration on hematopoietic recovery after allogeneic BSCT. Fifty-four patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing a related, HLA-matched allogeneic BSCT were randomly assigned to receive daily filgrastim at 10 microg/kg or placebo starting on the day of transplantation. A minimum of 3 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg in the allograft was required for transplantation. All patients received a standard preparative regimen and a standard regimen for the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The median time to achieve an absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 11 days (range, 9-20 days) for patients who received filgrastim compared with 15 days (range, 10-22 days) for patients who received placebo (P =.0082). The median time to achieve a platelet count greater than 20 x 10(9)/L was 13 days (range, 8-35 days) for patients who received filgrastim compared with 15.5 days (range, 8-42 days) for patients who received placebo (P =.79). There were no significant differences for red blood cell transfusion independence, the incidence of acute GVHD, or 100-day mortality between the groups. The administration of filgrastim appears to be a safe and effective supportive-care measure following allogeneic BSCT."

We hypothesized that these complaints may arise from intestinal ischemia caused by the shunting of blood away from the splanchnic circulation during endurance racing followed by reperfusion injury. Studies in animal models have suggested prophylactic vitamin E supplementation may prevent this type of injury. We sought to determine if prerace vitamin E supplementation would prevent intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury in humans. Forty subjects who planned to complete the 1996 Houston-Tennaco Marathon were randomized to receive vitamin E (1000 IU daily) or placebo (soya lecithin) for 2 wk before the race in a double-blinded trial. Inclusion criteria included no use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) within 24 d of the race or vitamin or mineral supplements containing vitamins C or E or selenium within 30 d of the race. Subjects were studied 2 wk before the race and immediately following the race. Blood was obtained for serum vitamin E and total lipid and salicylate concentrations. A solution of lactulose (5 g) and mannitol (2 g) was consumed and urine was collected for 6 h. Aliquots were assayed for lactulose and mannitol concentration. Stool samples were tested for occult blood and following the race subjects rated their nausea, abdominal pain, and cramping on a 1-5 scale. Twenty-six subjects (24 male, 2 female) completed the marathon. Finish times ranged between 2 h 43 min and 5 h 28 min. All subjects had heme-negative stool prerace and four developed heme-positive stool postrace, with no difference between vitamin E and placebo groups (Fisher's exact = 0.63). All had non-detectable salicylate concentrations pre- and postrace. Serum vitamin E concentration increased in botPP = 0.02 in the vitamin E group and 1.45 +/- 0.40 to 1.66 +/- 0.48 mg/dL in the placebo group, P = 0.02). However, the serum vitamin E: total lipid ratio increased significantly in the vitamin E-supplemented group (0.0022 +/- 0.0002 to 0.0051 +/- 0.0015, P = 0.02), but not in the placebo group (P = 0.25). Overall, the urinary lactulose:mannitol ratio increased from 0.03 +/- 0.02 to 0.06 +/- 0.08 postrace (P = 0.06) without difference between vitamin E or placebo groups. Intestinal permeability increased significantly more in those who developed occult bleeding. More subjects in the placebo group developed abdominal cramping (Fisher's exact = 0.04) and abdominal pain (Fisher's exact = 0.06), although there was no difference in severity between groups. There was no difference in the incidence of nausea and no diarrhea was reported by any subject. Intestinal permeability tends to increase and occult gastrointestinal bleeding occurs during endurance running, suggesting the occurrence of intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Prerace supplementation with the antioxidant vitamin E had no effect on performance, intestinal injury, occult bleeding, or the severity of postrace gastrointestinal complaints. Vitamin E supplementation was associated with a decreased incidence of these complaints but had no effect on their severity."

It consisted of a double-blind placebo-controlled study of mifepristone (600 mg) against placebo. A total of 46 women consulting for interrupted pregnancy were diagnosed at ultrasound with no clinical sign of miscarriage. Measurements were made of the occurrence of natural expulsion, the frequency of complete expulsion, the need for subsequent surgical evacuation, analgesia and the need for transfusion. Natural expulsion occurred within 5 days in 82% of patients receiving mifepristone treatment versus 8% of placebo-treated patients (P < 0.001). All patients experienced bleeding after RU 486 and two needed emergency aspiration for haemorrhagic expulsion. The treatment failed in four patients, who underwent evacuation under local anaesthesia. In the control group, 19 patients underwent evacuation under local (n = 10) or general (n = 9) anaesthesia.

Data were extracted and methodological quality was examined. Studies using rFVIIa prophylactically and those using rFVIIa therapeutically have been considered separately.

There were no outcomes by which any observed advantage, or disadvantage, of rFVIIa over placebo could not have been observed by chance alone. There were trends in favour of rFVIIa for a number of outcomes, particularly the number of participants transfused, pooled RR 0.85 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.01) but this was balanced by a trend against rFVIIa with respect to thromboembolic adverse events, pooled RR 1.25 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.07). Seven trials involving 1214 participants examined the therapeutic use of rFVIIa; 687 received rFVIIa.

There was a trend in favour of rFVIIa for reducing mortality, RR 0.82 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.04), although no other clear trends in favour of rFVIIa were noted for other desired outcomes. Interpretation of these results must take into account one study which could not be included in the quantitative summary but which showed results strongly in favour of rFVIIa for the treatment of intra-cerebral haemorrhage. There was a trend against rFVIIa with respect to thromboembolic adverse events; the RR 1.50 (95% CI 0.86 to 2.62).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although rFVIIa has a role in the management of patients with haemophilia, its effectiveness as a more general haemostatic drug, either prophylactically or therapeutically, remains uncertain. Its effectiveness as a therapeutic agent, particularly for intra-cerebral haemorrhage, looks more encouraging than prophylactic use. The use of rFVIIa outside its current licensed indications should be very limited and its wider use await the results of ongoing and possibly newly commissioned RCTs. In the interim, rFVIIa use should be restricted to clinical trials."

Furthermore, extrapolation of longer-term follow-up data for patient mortality appears to suggest that this advantage will be maintained in the longer term. Based on a reassessment of the published data, the authors note: (1) the incidence of rebleeding following treatment is approximately three times higher in the coiled group (p<0.001); (2) the need for aneurysm retreatment is likely to be higher in the coiled group; (3) trends in longer-term mortality data are not a reliable basis for predicting future outcomes of the trial; (4) trends in longer-term morbidity data are more reliable and suggest that the advantage of coiling diminishes with time; (5) The absence of up-to-date published rates of aneurysm retreatment and of longer-term rates of death or dependence makes ISAT extremely hard to interpret. It is far from clear that the early advantage of coiling will be maintained in the future and, hence, longer follow-up is required. Treatment of aneurysms is a continually evolving field and there is currently no other major source of information concerning management of aneurysms. For these reasons the authors recommend the instigation of a national aneurysm registry to prospectively collect data."

Ninety patients who underwent heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were studied. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=41) received the centrifuged autologous shed mediastinal blood collected from the cardiotomy reservoir 4 hours after surgery; in Group 2 (n=49) all shed mediastinal blood was discarded (control group). Haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (Hct), C-reactive protein values, and leucocyte count were compared before surgery, at 4 h and 20 h after surgery, and on the fifth postoperative day. We have measured serum procalcitonin (PCT) concentration at 4 h and 20 h after CPB. We assessed drained blood loss within 20 postoperative hours. Leucocyte count, Hb, Hct values, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin concentration did not differ between the groups before and at 4 h after surgery. Hb, Hct level, and leucocyte count were similar at 20 hours and on the fifth day after surgery. At 20 hours after surgery, an increase of serum PCT concentration (>0.5-2 ng/mL) was more frequent in Group 2 (58.3% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.03).

Previous studies investigating its use have yielded conflicting results and have often suffered from design defects. The theoretical lower incidence of respiratory and circulatory depression with IPA suggests significant advantages over epidural analgesia. Patients who had documented blunt chest wall trauma were entered into a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, crossover, placebo-controlled study within 16 hours of their injury. Patients who were intubated or had significant trauma outside of the chest wall were not entered. Intrapleural catheters were placed using a standardized technique. Each patient received either a placebo solution of normal saline or a combination of bupivacaine/lidocaine in a blinded, crossover fashion for two 24-hour periods. Data were obtained on the use of supplementary narcotics, transcutaneous pCO(2') pulse oximetry, pulmonary function tests, and both patient and nursing evaluations of pain based on a numeric analogue scale. A series of 16 patients from a Level I trauma center were identified over a 2-year period. The ratio of male to female was approximately 2:1, with an age range of 35-80 years. There were no complications related to catheter placement or anesthetic toxicity. Mean values for patient and nursing pain ratings revealed opposite trends. We found no significant difference in the mean values for supplemental narcotic use, pCO(2') p0(2') forced vital capacity, or forced expiratory volume between the placebo and the test solution. Although previous studies have suggested that IPA may be beneficial in the management of chest wall pain, this was not confirmed in our study for blunt chest injuries. The addition of IPA to the more traditional use of opioid analgesics was not more effective for management of blunt chest wall pain. Despite our small patient population (n = 16), the crossover design should have allowed clinically significant differences to become evident (alpha value = 0.95). A review of the literature and a historical basis for the evolution in the management of this type of pain is included."

Erythrocytapheresis provides a new therapeutic modality that can remove up to three times more red blood cells per single procedure and could thus have a clinical and economic benefit.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      To compare the number of treatment procedures between erythrocytapheresis and phlebotomy needed to reach the serum ferritin (SF) target level of 50 µg/L, a two-treatment-arms, randomized trial was conducted in which 38 newly diagnosed patients homozygous for C282Y were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to undergo either erythrocytapheresis or phlebotomy. A 50% decrease in the number of treatment procedures for erythrocytapheresis compared to phlebotomy was chosen as the relevant difference to detect.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Univariate analysis showed a significantly lower mean number of treatment procedures in the erythrocytapheresis group (9 vs. 27; ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.45; Mann-Whitney p < 0.001). After adjustments for the two important influential factors initial SF level and body weight, the reduction ratio was still significant (0.43; 95% CI, 0.35-0.52; p < 0.001).

These conditions likely contribute to premature cardiovascular disease and a 20 to 30 percent shortened life expectancy in this vulnerable population. Persons with serious mental illness need effective, appropriately tailored behavioral interventions to achieve and maintain weight loss. Psychiatric rehabilitation day programs provide logical intervention settings because mental health consumers often attend regularly and exercise can take place on-site. This paper describes the Randomized Trial of Achieving Healthy Lifestyles in Psychiatric Rehabilitation (ACHIEVE). The goal of the study is to determine the effectiveness of a behavioral weight loss intervention among persons with serious mental illness that attend psychiatric rehabilitation programs. Participants randomized to the intervention arm of the study are hypothesized to have greater weight loss than the control group.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A targeted 320 men and women with serious mental illness and overweight or obesity (body mass index ≥ 25.0 kg/m2) will be recruited from 10 psychiatric rehabilitation programs across Maryland. The core design is a randomized, two-arm, parallel, multi-site clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of an 18-month behavioral weight loss intervention to usual care. Active intervention participants receive weight management sessions and physical activity classes on-site led by study interventionists. The intervention incorporates cognitive adaptations for persons with serious mental illness attending psychiatric rehabilitation programs. The initial intensive intervention period is six months, followed by a twelve-month maintenance period in which trained rehabilitation program staff assume responsibility for delivering parts of the intervention. Primary outcomes are weight loss at six and 18 months.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Evidence-based approaches to the high burden of obesity and cardiovascular disease risk in person with serious mental illness are urgently needed. The ACHIEVE Trial is tailored to persons with serious mental illness in community settings. This multi-site randomized clinical trial will provide a rigorous evaluation of a practical behavioral intervention designed to accomplish and sustain weight loss in persons with serious mental illness."

Infants were randomly selected to receive either furosemide, 4 mg/kg in two divided doses on alternate days orally, or placebo for 8 days, followed by crossover to the alternate-therapy for an additional 8-day period. The two study periods were separated by a 48-hour washout period. Dynamic compliance, total pulmonary resistance, the concentration of electrolytes in serum, and the concentrations of calcium and creatinine in urine were measured on nontreatment days. Alternate-day furosemide therapy increased dynamic lung compliance by 76 +/- 112% and decreased total pulmonary resistance by 20 +/- 39%, compared with placebo (both variables p = 0.032). Alternate-day furosemide therapy did not result in increased urine output, electrolyte abnormalities, or increased urinary calcium excretion.

            "abstract": "One hundred thirteen patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomly assigned to receive either bovine or porcine heparin. Heparin was infused at 4.5 mg/kg during bypass and administered at the lesser of 70 units/kg or 5000 units/dose at 12-hour intervals postoperatively. Platelet counts decreased to 45% of preoperative levels during the first 3 days postoperatively (porcine, 44 +/- 13%, n = 50; bovine, 46 +/- 15%), but returned to preoperative levels by the seventh postoperative day. The average blood loss in the porcine heparin group significantly exceeded that of the bovine heparin group (porcine, 1350.7 +/- 727.8 ml; bovine, 1059.6 +/- 381.0 ml; p less than .01). Consequently, the platelet transfusion requirement was greater in the porcine heparin group (porcine, 1.7 +/- 3.9 units; bovine, 0.5 +/- 1.7 units; p less than .05); however, blood and blood component (with the exception of platelets) administration was not significantly different between the two groups. The four patients taking anticoagulants or antiinflammatory agents in the porcine group required a mean of 8.5 units of red blood cells (RBC) plus supplemental platelets. The seven such patients in the bovine group received a mean of 3.0 units of RBC and no platelets. Thus, the use of porcine heparin resulted in a generalized increase in postoperative bleeding with increased management problems in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass."

            "abstract": "The efficacy of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil has been assessed clinically in a double blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre study in patients with grade I-III portosystemic encephalopathy. In an ancillary study reported here the effect of flumazenil on the electroencephalogram (EEG) was analysed in 32 patients who had EEG grading according to protocol. Following the baseline observation period, patients were randomised to receive (at 1 min interval) 3 sequential bolus injections of flumazenil (0.4, 0.8 and 1 mg) or placebo followed by infusions of flumazenil (1 mg/h) or placebo for 3 h. Patients were monitored for 5 h after infusion. A positive response was defined as 1 point improvement in EEG grade. After independent analysis of the EEG gradings 5 out of 17 (29%) flumazenil treated patients showed an improvement in EEG grading (3 after bolus, 2 during follow-up) compared to 2 out of 15 (13%) placebo treated patients (1 after bolus, 1 during follow-up) (95% confidence interval of difference: -12% to + 50%). Of the 5 EEG responders after flumazenil, 3 also had an improvement in clinical PSE grading (none after bolus, 2 during infusion, 1 during follow-up), compared to neither of the 2 EEG responders after placebo. EEg responders did not differ from non-responders with respect to Child-Pugh score, basal EEG, PSE grade and positivity for benzodiazepines. In conclusion, treatment perspectives for flumazenil in portosystemic encephalopathy appear to be present for only a minority of patients; however, this study yields no support for a major role of benzodiazepine antagonists in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy."

We report on the design and preliminary results of our ongoing randomized control pilot trial (ClinicalTrial.gov NCT00945542).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This is a 2-year feasibility randomized control trial at a single tertiary trauma center. Bleeding trauma patients were randomized to either a laboratory-driven or a formula-driven (1 plasma:1 platelet:1 RBC) transfusion protocols. Feasibility was assessed by analyzing for ability to enroll patients, appropriate activation of transfusion protocols, time to transfusion of each type of blood product, laboratory turnaround time, ratio of blood products transfused, and wastage of blood products.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From July 6, 2009, to May 31, 2010, n = 18 patients were randomized and included in the study. Issues that we noted were the need to do postrandomization exclusions, the need to have rapid and accurate predictors of massive bleeding to enroll patients quickly, and the need to have waived consent for study participation. As well, we noted that the logistics of administering 1:1:1 were formidable and required rapid access to thawed plasma. Similarly, challenges in the control arm of such a study included the turnaround time for obtaining laboratory results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Despite major challenges, our initial experience suggests that with an organized system, it is possible to prospectively randomize massively bleeding trauma patients. The accomplishment of high ratios of plasma to RBCs is challenging with current thawing methods and unavailability of thawed plasma in Canada. Longer shelf-life for plasma and faster plasma thawing microwaves should overcome some of these obstacles. For a laboratory-guided transfusion protocol, massive transfusion protocols should be in place with faster turnaround time for coagulation tests. Finally, further research on predictors of massive transfusion is needed."

The Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia showed that transfusion therapy is effective in the primary prevention of stroke. Despite its efficacy, transfusion therapy is limited by alloimmunization. The purpose of this study was to determine if a multicenter trial could implement a transfusion program utilizing phenotypically matched blood to reduce alloimmunization.\n    \n\n\n          Study design and methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred thirty children underwent RBC phenotyping and antibody screening with review of blood bank records.

Five patients (8%) developed a clinically significant alloantibody. Four developed a single antibody to E or Kell. Three patients (5%) developed a warm autoantibody. There were 11 transfusion reactions and 8 transfusion-associated events. Transfusion reactions included 6 febrile reactions (0.33%/unit), 3 allergic (0.16%/unit), and 2 hemolytic (0.11%/unit).

Costs and health benefits, expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), are reported from the 'within-trial' analysis and for the decision-analytic model. The probability of cost-effectiveness for each form of management is calculated taking into account the small sample size and other sources of uncertainty. In the range of scenarios considered in the analysis, preoperative transfusion was more effective, with the mean improvement in QALYs ranging from 0.018 to 0.206 per patient, and also less costly in all but one scenario, with the mean cost difference ranging from -£813 to £26.

Clinically meaningful deteriorations were demonstrated in the vibratory perception threshold in the toe and the Valsalva ratio. The greatest deterioration rate in electrophysiologic measures was found in peroneal F-wave latency and in sensory nerve conduction velocities in the upper limb, but none of these reached the threshold of clinically meaningful change. Assuming that drug efficacy will be based on the deterioration rates in placebo patients alone, the present data suggest a minimum of 250 patients treated for at least 2 years to achieve convincing efficacy."

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that maintaining high hemoglobin levels in patients after chemotherapy reduced the length of neutropenia. Thus, we undertook a randomized, controlled, clinical trial in children undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation after receiving a myeloablative conditioning regimen to compare 2 hemoglobin thresholds as triggers for red blood cell transfusion: 120 g/L in the experimental arm and 70 g/L in the control arm. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board closed the study after enrollment of the sixth patient because 3 patients in the experimental arm contracted veno-occlusive disease, but none in the control arm did (P = .05). Ascites was present in all 3 patients, pleura effusion in 2, and portal vein thrombosis in 2. One patient experienced hepatic failure and required treatment with the molecular adsorbent recycling system. Another patient required hemodialysis for renal failure. No major imbalance between groups was seen with regard to risk factors for veno-occlusive disease. Therefore, maintaining the hemoglobin at higher levels should be avoided after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."

DFMO pharmacokinetics was linear and attained an average peak plasma concentration of 58 micrograms/ml and an average area under the concentration x time curve from 0 to 6 h of 240 micrograms/ml.h at an administered dose of 1600 mg/m2. Transient decreases in RBC polyamine levels were observed in only 3 of 22 subjects; all of the others showed an increase in the levels at some time during DFMO administration. In contrast to these findings, 17 of 22 subjects showed a decline in urinary polyamines; 10 of 22 showed this decline by the end of the first month and the remaining subjects during subsequent administration of the drug. One subject with familial polyposis who had high RBC and urinary polyamine levels prior to DFMO treatment showed a significant decline in urinary polyamines and responded to DFMO treatment with nearly complete resolution of the polyps in the rectal stump. Our results suggest that (a) DFMO concentrations achieved in this study are adequate to modulate polyamine pools as reflected by their reduced urinary excretion; (b) the red blood cell polyamines are not reliable indicators of DFMO activity; and (c) the modulation of polyamines occurs at doses of DFMO that are tolerated by a majority of the subjects."

            "abstract": "Childhood hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is most often caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). Due to severe hemolysis, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are often necessary, and anemia is aggravated by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels caused by acute renal failure. In a single center, prospective study, we randomized ten children with EHEC-positive HUS into two therapeutic groups: one receiving EPO treatment (median age 2 years, age range 1-3 years) and the other receiving standard therapy (median age 2 years, age range 1-6 years). Red blood cell transfusions were performed when the hemoglobin level (Hb) fell below 5 mg/dl. The number of RBC transfusions was compared in both groups. The Hb level at admission was comparable between both groups (6.4 vs. 8.1 mg/dl, P > 0.05, t-test). However, children in the EPO group required a significantly lower mean number of RBCs than those in the non-EPO group (0.2 vs. 1.4, P < 0.04, t-test). Based on these results, we suggest that the early administration of EPO at the time of hemolytic anemia and beginning renal failure may attenuate renal anemia in children with EHEC-induced HUS and thereby reduce the number of RBC transfusions required. The results of this pilot study will have to be confirmed in a larger multicenter trial."

            "abstract": "Oncologists have several reasons for trying to maintain or increase hemoglobin levels in their patients during therapy. Relief of the symptoms of anemia, including fatigue and dyspnea, are traditional, well-accepted indications. A newer rationale is to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy in controlling tumors. A laboratory animal study found that administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) increased intratumoral median oxygen levels and diminished the proportion of measurements in the very low (< 3 mm Hg) range. Hemoglobin level is a strong independent prognostic factor for tumor control by radiation therapy. The hemoglobin level at the end of radiation therapy is a stronger prognostic factor than is the hemoglobin level at the start of therapy. Numerous clinical trials have utilized rHuEPO during radiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy. All 4 trials which enrolled patients with low hemoglobin levels (< 12 to 13.5 g/dl) found that rHuEPO significantly increased hemoglobin within 2 weeks and that hemoglobin levels continued to rise until the end of rHuEPO treatment. rHuEPO was efficacious in limiting the decrease in hemoglobin and use of packed red blood cell transfusion in the one reported trial in which it was used in patients with initially normal hemoglobin levels during intensive concurrent radiation and chemotherapy. One trial found a statistically significant improvement in complete pathologic response rate after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with the use of rHuEPO. rHuEPO has a potentially large to play in the care of the cancer patient."

Reluctantly, a number of laboratory and observational studies have indicated that the amount of time RBCs are stored can affect oxygen delivery to tissues. Consequently, older RBCs may result in higher rates of organ dysfunction, nosocomial infection, and lengths of stay. Because of such harmful effects, an evaluation of the association between age of blood and nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction is warranted. The aim of the study was to determine if RBCs stored for 7 days or less (fresh RBCs) compared to current standard transfusion practice decreases major nosocomial infection and organ dysfunction in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit and requiring at least one RBC transfusion. This study is a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial design. The trial will be an effectiveness study evaluating the effectiveness of stored vs fresh RBCs in neonates requiring transfusion. Neonatal patients requiring at least one unit of RBCs will be randomized to receive either (1) RBCs stored no longer than 7 days or (2) standard practice. The study was conducted in Canadian university-affiliated level III (tertiary) neonatal intensive care units. The primary outcome for this study will be a composite measure of major neonatal morbidities (necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and mortality). Secondary outcomes include individual items of the composite measure and nosocomial infection (bacteremia, septic shock, and pneumonia). The sample size calculations have been estimated based on the formula for 2 independent proportions using an alpha of .05, a (1-beta) of .80, and a 10% noncompliance factor. The baseline rate for our composite measure is estimated to be 65% as indicated by the literature. Assuming a 15% absolute risk reduction with the use of RBCs stored 7 days or less, our estimated total sample size required will be 450 (225 patients per treatment arm).

            "abstract": "Placebos are an essential tool in randomised clinical trials, where they are used to control for bias and contextual healing effects. Placebos and their effects are also studied from multiple diverse perspectives, but the perspectives of placebo recipients are seldom considered. Research shows that people form cognitive and affective representations of active treatments such as medicines, and that they use these representations to guide their behaviour; it seems reasonable to suggest that people might also think about and develop representations of placebos. We adopted a qualitative approach to examine in detail how participants in one RCT, conducted in the USA, conceptualised placebos. 12 people were interviewed 3 times each, at the start, middle, and end of a trial of placebo effects and acupuncture for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The interview data were analysed inductively and we identified four ways in which the participants conceptualised placebos: placebos are necessary for research; placebo effects are fake; placebo acupuncture is not real acupuncture; placebos have real effects mediated by psychological mechanisms. Participants' conceptualisations of placebos were dynamic and situated in a broader psychological and socio-cultural context. Seeing placebo effects as legitimate seemed to be facilitated by having more holistic models of healing, viewing IBS as psychological, and seeing treatment as multifactorial. However, some participants maintained a negative view of placebo effects (e.g. as illusions) that was apparently inconsistent with their other beliefs (e.g. in mind-body healing mechanisms). This may indicate a dominance of negative discourses around placebos at a socio-cultural level. Negative views of placebos are inconsistent with evidence that placebo treatments can have positive effects on symptoms. RCT participants should be informed about potential benefits of placebo treatments to avoid misunderstandings and unease. Future work should improve methods of providing participants with full accurate information about placebos and their effects."

This subgingival cleansing might not be adequately detected by the PHP index. These results might indicate a gingival health promotion potential for this toothbrush with conical filaments."

            "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a recalcitrant inflammatory process which has a marked detrimental impact on quality of life. At the present there is no cure for this condition, measures are taken to stop progression, and provide symptomatic relief. Topical corticosteroids are commonly prescribed in the management of CRS, but few trials show effectiveness in clinical settings. We set up a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effectiveness of a topical corticosteroid agent--fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (FPANS) in patients with CRS. We measured symptoms, diary card, and rigid endoscopy scores, acoustic rhinometry, middle meatal swabs, blood tests--CRP, ESR, WBC, and eosinophil count. Measurements were done at the start of the trial, at 8 weeks, and 16 weeks where possible. Twenty-two patients completed the trial, 9 received FPANS, and 13 had placebo. There was no difference between the 2 groups on all counts. When patients were considered as one group, there was an improvement in the diary card scores (p = 0.054), comparing baseline to 8 or 16 weeks. There was no evidence that the regular use of topical corticosteroid increased the risk of developing an infection. An important observation was that the topical corticosteroid did not precipitate acute sinusitis. There is compelling evidence that topical corticosteroids down-regulate cytokine expression, and it is likely that a larger, and longer multi-centre trial may prove their efficacy in CRS."

            "abstract": "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) comprises 15% of all strokes, and carries the highest risk of mortality and poor long-term outcome. ICH has long been recognized as the least treatable form of stroke, and hematoma volume as the strongest single predictor of mortality and outcome. CT-based studies have found that early substantial hematoma expansion occurs in 18-38% of patients initially scanned within 3 h of symptom onset. This finding is associated with early neurological deterioration and an increased risk of poor outcome. Ultra-early hemostatic therapy might be beneficial in preventing hematoma growth, resulting in improved mortality and neurological function. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) promotes local hemostasis in the presence or absence of coagulopathy at sites of vascular injury, and is a promising treatment for arresting active bleeding in ICH. The safety and feasibility of this approach was confirmed in a phase IIb randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of 399 patients with non-coagulopathic ICH. Administration of rFVIIa within 4 h of ICH onset resulted in a significant reduction of hematoma expansion at 24 h, and reduced mortality and improved functional outcome at 90 days. A confirmatory phase III trial (The FAST Trial) to confirm these results will complete enrollment in the end of 2006."

A total of 142 patients with a proved duodenal or gastric ulcer were randomised after stratification for age and site of ulcer to early (aggressive) surgical management or a delayed (conservative) policy. Significantly more operations (n = 42; 60%) were performed in the early than in the delayed (n = 9; 20%) groups (p less than 0.01). There were no deaths among the 42 patients under 60. The overall mortality in the 100 patients aged over 60 was 10% and when analysed on an \"intention to treat\" basis there was no difference between early and delayed surgery. When, however, an unrelated death from a bleeding colonic polyp was excluded and the data analysed on \"treatment received\" the mortality was only 2% in the early group compared with 13% in the delayed group (p less than 0.05). When analysis was confined to gastric ulcer the difference between early (0%) and delayed (24%) treatment was even greater. The results of this trial indicate that for patients over 60 an aggressive surgical policy is associated with a significant reduction in mortality."

After dramatic advances in blood banking in the 1970s, blood donor centers began supplying hospitals with individual components [red blood cell (RBC), plasma, platelets] and removed WB as an available product. However, no studies of efficacy or hemostatic potential in trauma patients were performed before doing so.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Single-center, randomized trial of severely injured patients predicted to large transfusion volume. Pregnant patients, prisoners, those younger than 18 years or with more than 20% total body surface area burns (TBSA) burns were excluded. Patients were randomized to mWB (1 U mWB) or COMP therapy (1 U RBC+ 1 U plasma) immediately on arrival. Each group also received 1 U platelets (apheresis or prepooled random donor) for every 6 U of mWB or 6 U of RBC + 6 U plasma. The study was performed under the Exception From Informed Consent (Food and Drug Administration 21 code of federal regulations [CFR] 50.24).

There were no differences in demographics, arrival vitals or laboratory values, injury severity, or mechanism. Transfusions were similar between groups (intent-to-treat analysis). However, when excluding patients with severe brain injury (sensitivity analysis), WB group received less 24-hour RBC (median 3 vs 6, P = 0.02), plasma (4 vs 6, P = 0.02), platelets (0 vs 3, P = 0.09), and total products (11 vs 16, P = 0.02).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Compared with COMP therapy, WB did not reduce transfusion volumes in severely injured patients predicted to receive massive transfusion.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Among trauma patients who survive to reach hospital, exsanguination is a common cause of death. A widely practicable treatment that reduces blood loss after trauma could prevent thousands of premature deaths each year. The CRASH-2 trial aimed to determine the effect of the early administration of tranexamic acid on death and transfusion requirement in bleeding trauma patients. In addition, the effort of tranexamic acid on the risk of vascular occlusive events was assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces bleeding in patients undergoing elective surgery. We assessed the effects and cost-effectiveness of the early administration of a short course of TXA on death, vascular occlusive events and the receipt of blood transfusion in trauma patients.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Randomised placebo-controlled trial and economic evaluation. Randomisation was balanced by centre, with an allocation sequence based on a block size of eight, generated with a computer random number generator. Both participants and study staff (site investigators and trial co-ordinating centre staff) were masked to treatment allocation. All analyses were by intention to treat. A Markov model was used to assess cost-effectiveness. The health outcome was the number of life-years (LYs) gained. Cost data were obtained from hospitals, the World Health Organization database and UK reference costs. Cost-effectiveness was measured in international dollars ($) per LY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results to model assumptions.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Two hundred and seventy-four hospitals in 40 countries.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      Adult trauma patients (n = 20,211) with, or at risk of, significant bleeding who were within 8 hours of injury.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 minutes then infusion of 1 g over 8 hours) or matching placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcome measures:\n        \n      \n      The primary outcome was death in hospital within 4 weeks of injury, and was described with the following categories: bleeding, vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction, stroke and pulmonary embolism), multiorgan failure, head injury and other.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients were allocated to TXA (n = 10,096) and to placebo (n = 10,115), of whom 10,060 and 10,067 patients, respectively, were analysed. All-cause mortality at 28 days was significantly reduced by TXA [1463 patients (14.5%) in the TXA group vs 1613 patients (16.0%) in the placebo group; relative risk (RR) 0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.97; p = 0.0035]. The risk of death due to bleeding was significantly reduced [489 patients (4.9%) died in the TXA group vs 574 patients (5.7%) in the placebo group; RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.76 to 0.96; p = 0.0077]. We recorded strong evidence that the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding varied according to the time from injury to treatment (test for interaction p < 0.0001). Early treatment (≤ 1 hour from injury) significantly reduced the risk of death due to bleeding [198 out of 3747 patients (5.3%) died in the TXA group vs 286 out of 3704 patients (7.7%) in the placebo group; RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.57 to 0.82; p < 0.0001]. Treatment given between 1 and 3 hours also reduced the risk of death due to bleeding [147 out of 3037 patients (4.8%) died in the TXA group vs 184 out of 2996 patients (6.1%) in the placebo group; RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03]. Treatment given after 3 hours seemed to increase the risk of death due to bleeding [144 out of 3272 patients (4.4%) died in the TXA group vs 103 out of 3362 patients (3.1%) in the placebo group; RR 1.44; 95% CI1.12 to 1.84; p = 0.004]. We recorded no evidence that the effect of TXA on death due to bleeding varied by systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale score or type of injury. Administering TXA to bleeding trauma patients within 3 hours of injury saved an estimated 755 LYs per 1000 trauma patients in the UK. The cost of giving TXA to 1000 patients was estimated at $30,830. The incremental cost of giving TXA compared with not giving TXA was $48,002. The incremental cost per LY gained of administering TXA was $64.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Early administration of TXA safely reduced the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients and is highly cost-effective. Treatment beyond 3 hours of injury is unlikely to be effective.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Late onset sepsis is a frequent complication of prematurity associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The commensal bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract play a key role in the development of healthy immune responses. Healthy term infants acquire these commensal organisms rapidly after birth. However, colonisation in preterm infants is adversely affected by delivery mode, antibiotic treatment and the intensive care environment. Altered microbiota composition may lead to increased colonisation with pathogenic bacteria, poor immune development and susceptibility to sepsis in the preterm infant.Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host. Amongst numerous bacteriocidal and nutritional roles, they may also favourably modulate host immune responses in local and remote tissues. Meta-analyses of probiotic supplementation in preterm infants report a reduction in mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. Studies with sepsis as an outcome have reported mixed results to date.Allergic diseases are increasing in incidence in \"westernised\" countries. There is evidence that probiotics may reduce the incidence of these diseases by altering the intestinal microbiota to influence immune function.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial investigating supplementing preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation weighing < 1500 g, with a probiotic combination (Bifidobacterium infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Bifidobacterium lactis). A total of 1,100 subjects are being recruited in Australia and New Zealand. Infants commence the allocated intervention from soon after the start of feeds until discharge home or term corrected age. The primary outcome is the incidence of at least one episode of definite (blood culture positive) late onset sepsis before 40 weeks corrected age or discharge home. Secondary outcomes include: Necrotising enterocolitis, mortality, antibiotic usage, time to establish full enteral feeds, duration of hospital stay, growth measurements at 6 and 12 months' corrected age and evidence of atopic conditions at 12 months' corrected age.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Results from previous studies on the use of probiotics to prevent diseases in preterm infants are promising.

None the less, a positive change in the haematological variables of treated patients was clearly discernible. The negative result may be due to the short treatment interval and to iron deficiency, which was present in the majority of patients. The general change of attitude towards allogeneic blood transfusion is demonstrated by the overall low frequency of blood transfusion in this study."

            "abstract": "Background and purpose:\n        \n      \n      Telemedicine techniques can be used to address the rural-metropolitan disparity in acute stroke care. The Stroke Team Remote Evaluation Using a Digital Observation Camera (STRokE DOC) trial reported more accurate decision making for telemedicine consultations compared with telephone-only and that the California-based research network facilitated a high rate of thrombolysis use, improved data collection, low risk of complications, low technical complications, and favorable assessment times. The main objective of the STRokE DOC Arizona TIME (The Initial Mayo Clinic Experience) trial was to determine the feasibility of establishing, de novo, a single-hub, multirural spoke hospital telestroke research network across a large geographical area in Arizona by replicating the STRokE DOC protocol.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Methods included prospective, single-hub, 2-spoke, randomized, blinded, controlled trial of a 2-way, site-independent, audiovisual telemedicine system designed for remote examination of adult patients with acute stroke versus telephone consultation to assess eligibility for treatment with intravenous thrombolysis. The primary outcome measure was whether the decision to give thrombolysis was correct. Secondary outcomes were rate of thrombolytic use, 90-day functional outcomes, incidence of intracerebral hemorrhages, and technical observations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From December 2007 to October 2008, 54 patients were assessed, 27 of whom were randomized to each arm. Mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation was 7.3 (SD 6.2) points. No consultations were aborted; however, technical problems (74%) were prevalent in the telemedicine arm. Overall, the correct treatment decision was established in 87% of the consultations. Both modalities, telephone (89% correct) and telemedicine (85% correct), performed well. Intravenous thrombolytic treatment was used in 30% of the telemedicine and telephone consultations. Good functional outcomes at 90 days were not significantly different. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality (4% in telemedicine and 11% in telephone) or rates of intracerebral hemorrhage (4% in telemedicine and 0% in telephone).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      It is feasible to extend the original STRokE DOC trial protocol to a new state and establish an operational single-hub, multispoke rural hospital telestroke research network in Arizona. The trial was not designed to have sufficient power to detect a difference between the 2 consultative modes: telemedicine and telephone-only. Whether by telemedicine or telephone consultative modalities, there were appropriate treatment decisions, high rates of thrombolysis use, improved data collection, low rates of intracerebral hemorrhage, and equally favorable time requirements. The learning curve was steep for the hub and spoke personnel of the new telestroke network, as reflected by frequent technical problems. Overall, the results support the effectiveness of highly organized and structured stroke telemedicine networks for extending expert stroke care into rural remote communities lacking sufficient neurological expertise."

No differences were observed in the decrease in haemoglobin, requirement for additional oxytocics, the need for blood transfusion or the degree of shivering in each group (p > 0.05 in each case).

Hematologic measurements, transfusion requirements, and growth were followed during therapy and for 6 months thereafter. Treated (EPO) and control babies did not differ with respect to weight, hematocrit, overall mean absolute reticulocyte count, calculated erythrocyte mass, or rate of growth. However, reticulocyte counts increased earlier in patients given r-HuEPO. Six of ten babies in the EPO group, and 8 of 10 assigned to the control group, received at least one erythrocyte transfusion during treatment. For all infants the amount of blood sampled for laboratory tests was strongly predictive of the volume of packed erythrocytes transfused (r = 0.890; p = 0.0001). Of nine infants who had less than 20 ml packed erythrocytes removed for laboratory tests, none of four given r-HuEPO received a transfusion, whereas three of five infants assigned to the placebo group received one. No toxic effects were attributable to r-HuEPO, and no significant changes in leukocyte or platelet counts occurred during treatment. Reticulocyte counts were correlated with simultaneous platelet counts and were inversely related to absolute neutrophil counts in both study groups.

Investigations from the last decade established that extent of ICH-mediated brain injury relates directly to blood clot volume and duration of blood exposure to brain tissue. Using minimally-invasive surgery plus recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), MISTIE investigators explored aggressive avenues to treat ICH.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We investigated the difference between surgical intervention plus rtPA and standard medical management for ICH.

The benefit as measured in clinical trials may be affected by changes of blood pressure at entry and by departure from randomised treatment, but the magnitude of such effects is disputed. We have assessed benefit from reduction of stroke using data from the MRC Trial of mild to moderate hypertension, taking these factors into account, and have studied the likely effect of recent guidelines. The original analysis suggested that 850 patients needed treatment for 1 year to prevent one stroke. Under the more conservative of two assumptions made about the effect of treatment, this falls to 695 patients when allowance is made for reduction of stroke in placebo group patients withdrawn and actively treated, to 680 patients when allowance is made for the fall in blood pressure after entry, and to 556 patients with allowance for both. When benefit is assessed in patients whose entry diastolic blood pressure was > or = 100 mm Hg, 557 patients require treatment annually per stroke saved and this is decreased to 360 patients when allowance is made for withdrawal and active treatment of placebo group patients. These results suggest that benefit from reduction of stroke was underestimated in the MRC trial and that this is likely to be present in most trials. Changes to diagnostic criteria for hypertension in new management guidelines are likely to have significant effects on the number of patients treated per stroke prevented."

            "abstract": "The effects of therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin (Epoetin alfa) on erythropoiesis, preoperative autologous blood donation, and risk of exposure to allogeneic blood were evaluated in 204 patients scheduled to undergo elective orthopedic surgery. Study protocol required patients to have a baseline hematocrit < or = 39% and surgery scheduled 25-35 days in advance. Patients were randomized to two equal groups and were seen at study centers every 3-4 days within the 21-day trial period. At each visit, phlebotomy(< or = 450 mL) was performed if the hematocrit was > or = 33%, and Epoetin alfa (600 U/kg) or placebo was administered intravenously. A total of 173 patients were assessable; 31% of placebo recipients and 20% of Epoetin alfa recipients required allogeneic transfusion (p = 0.09). Logistic regression modeling showed that the risk of allogeneic transfusion was reduced by Epoetin alfa (p = 0.025). When patients receiving > 6 units of blood (necessitating allogeneic units) were excluded from analysis, 29% of placebo recipients and 14% of Epoetin alfa recipients were exposed to allogeneic blood (p = 0.015). Epoetin alfa recipients predonated more autologous units than did placebo recipients (4.5 vs 3.0 units, respectively; p < 0.001), and their production of red blood cells increased significantly more over baseline production values (668 vs 353 mL, respectively; p < 0.05). These results demonstrate that administration of Epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis, allows predonation of more units of autologous blood, and reduces the risk of exposure to allogeneic blood. Optimal dosing regimens and surgical patients most likely to benefit fro Epoetin alfa therapy must be established."

            "abstract": "Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (AUGIB) is the commonest reason for hospitalization with hemorrhage in the UK and the leading indication for transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs). Observational studies suggest an association between more liberal RBC transfusion and adverse patient outcomes, and a recent randomised trial reported increased further bleeding and mortality with a liberal transfusion policy. TRIGGER (Transfusion in Gastrointestinal Bleeding) is a pragmatic, cluster randomized trial which aims to evaluate the feasibility and safety of implementing a restrictive versus liberal RBC transfusion policy in adult patients admitted with AUGIB. The trial will take place in 6 UK hospitals, and each centre will be randomly allocated to a transfusion policy. Clinicians throughout each hospital will manage all eligible patients according to the transfusion policy for the 6-month trial recruitment period. In the restrictive centers, patients become eligible for RBC transfusion when their hemoglobin is <8 g/dL. In the liberal centers patients become eligible for transfusion once their hemoglobin is <10 g/dL. All clinicians will have the discretion to transfuse outside of the policy but will be asked to document the reasons for doing so. Feasibility outcome measures include protocol adherence, recruitment rate, and evidence of selection bias. Clinical outcome measures include further bleeding, mortality, thromboembolic events, and infections. Quality of life will be measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D at day 28, and the costs associated with hospitalization for AUGIB in the UK will be estimated. Consent will be sought from participants or their representatives according to patient capacity for use of routine hospital data and day 28 follow up. The study has ethical approval for conduct in England and Scotland. Results will be analysed according to a pre-defined statistical analysis plan and disseminated in peer reviewed publications to relevant stakeholders. The results of this study will inform the feasibility and design of a phase III randomized trial."

Of the deaths 99% are in low and middle income countries. Obstetric haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality, most occurring in the postpartum period. Systemic antifibrinolytic agents are widely used in surgery to prevent clot breakdown (fibrinolysis) in order to reduce surgical blood loss. At present there is little reliable evidence from randomised trials on the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in the treatment of postpartum haemorrhage.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The Trial aims to determine the effect of early administration of tranexamic acid on mortality, hysterectomy and other morbidities (surgical interventions, blood transfusion, risk of non-fatal vascular events) in women with clinically diagnosed postpartum haemorrhage. The use of health services and safety, especially thromboembolic effect, on breastfed babies will also be assessed. The trial will be a large, pragmatic, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial among 15,000 women with a clinical diagnosis of postpartum haemorrhage. All legally adult women with clinically diagnosed postpartum haemorrhage following vaginal delivery of a baby or caesarean section will potentially be eligible. The fundamental eligibility criterion is the responsible clinician's 'uncertainty' as to whether or not to use an antifibrinolytic agent in a particular woman with postpartum haemorrhage. Treatment will entail a dose of tranexamic acid (1 gram by intravenous injection) or placebo (sodium chloride 0.9%) will be given as soon as possible after randomisation. A second dose may be given if after 30 minutes bleeding continues, or if it stops and restarts within 24 hours after the first dose. The main analyses will be on an 'intention to treat' basis, irrespective of whether the allocated treatment was received or not. Subgroup analyses for the primary outcome will be based on type of delivery; administration or not of prophylactic uterotonics; and on whether the clinical decision to consider trial entry was based primarily on estimated blood loss alone or on haemodynamic instability. A study with 15,000 women will have over 90% power to detect a 25% reduction from 4% to 3% in the primary endpoint of mortality or hysterectomy."

Many laboratories continue to administer heparin intravenously for 12 to 24 hours in an attempt to alleviate this problem. But prolonged heparin therapy delays sheath removal and may lead to groin and vascular complications, and so prolong the hospital stay. To test the hypothesis that subcutaneous heparin was as efficacious as intravenous heparin in preventing acute closure while reducing the vascular complications associated with extended sheath placement, we prospectively randomized 151 patients to two groups. The intravenous group, 77 patients, received continuous intravenous heparin at 1000 units/hour for 12 to 18 hours; the subcutaneous group, 74 patients, received 12,500 units subcutaneously every 12 hours for three doses after sheath removal 2 to 3 hours after the angioplasty. The activated clotting time immediately after the angioplasty was 401 +/- 108 seconds in subcutaneous group, as compared with 368 +/- 67 seconds in the intravenous group (p = 0.028). Patients receiving subcutaneous heparin continued to show adequate anticoagulation, with a PTT of 85 +/- 21 seconds obtained approximately 12 hours after the procedure.

Routine hematochemical evaluations, perioperative blood loss, major complications, and outcomes were also recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No differences were found between the groups regarding demographics, baseline hematochemical data, and operative characteristics. There was no difference in the amount of transfusions of packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma, platelet concentrates, total number of patients transfused (control group, 36% vs. ANH group, 34.3%; P = 0.88), and amount of postoperative bleeding (control group, 412 ml [313-552 ml] vs. ANH group, 374 ml [255-704 ml]) (median [25th-75th percentiles]); P = 0.94. Further, perioperative complications, postoperative hematochemical data, and outcomes were not different.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In patients undergoing elective open-heart surgery, low-volume ANH showed lack of efficacy in reducing the need for allogeneic transfusions and postoperative bleeding."

The mean half-life of the neocyte-enriched RBCs was 45.2 +/- 8.2 days in one laboratory and 45.1 +/- 4.4 days in the other. This represented a more than 30 percent increase in half-life for the neocyte-enriched RBCs, a significant difference. This new system, a two-bag set that costs +15, allows the simple, efficient separation of neocyte-enriched RBCs that would have a longer half-life and could reduce the transfusion requirement in patients receiving chronic transfusion therapy."

The primary outcome was exposure to allogeneic blood up to the first 24 hours postinjury.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-three patients were entered into the control group and 21 into the CS group. The groups were equivalent in demographic details, injury patterns and injury severity. The mean volume of salvaged blood re-infused in the CS group was 1,493 ml (range 0-2,690 ml). The mean number of units of allogeneic blood transfused in the first 24 hours in the control group was 11.17 compared to 6.47 in the CS group (P=0.008). Enteric injury had been sustained in 17/23 (75%) of the control group and 18/21 (85%) of the CS group (P=NS). Survival in the control group was 8/23 (35%) compared to 7/21 (33.3%) in the CS arm (P=NS). Patients with documented postoperative sepsis were significantly more likely to die compared to those without sepsis (P=0.04); however, those patients in the CS arm were no more likely to develop sepsis compared to those who received allogeneic blood alone.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this randomised, controlled trial for patients with penetrating abdominal injuries, IBS led to a significant reduction in allogeneic blood usage with no discernable effect on rates of postoperative infection or mortality."

            "abstract": "Controlled trials have shown that bleeding peptic ulcers can be successfully treated by endoscopy and injection of adrenaline, with or without sclerosant. However, these trials have been done in major research centres, and endoscopic treatment of upper gastrointestinal bleeding has not yet become routine in general hospitals. We have done a prospective, randomised, controlled trial of injection treatment for bleeding peptic ulcers in a district general hospital. Between April, 1989, and June, 1991, all patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 555) underwent endoscopy by an experienced endoscopist within 24 h of admission. 98 patients were found to have an ulcer with a visible vessel, of whom 93 were randomised to injection (n = 48) or standard treatment alone (n = 45). Injection treatment consisted of 1-2 ml of 1 in 10,000 adrenaline injected at four to six sites around the ulcer. Adrenaline and 5% ethanolamine oleate (1-2 ml) were then injected directly into the vessel. The medical team managing the patient was unaware of the endoscopic treatment given. The two groups were similar for age, initial haemoglobin concentration, shock, and ulcer site. Rebleeding (injected 8 [16.7%] vs control 21 [46.7%], p = 0.011) was significantly reduced in treated patients. The treated group also had lower mortality (4 [8.3%] vs 9 [20%]), requirement for surgery (4 [8.3%] vs 8 [17.8%]), and mean blood-transfusion requirement (5 vs 7.5 units). Endoscopic injection treatment in our patients significantly reduced rebleeding rate and may have other benefits. This cheap and widely applicable treatment can be used routinely in the management of patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who are at high risk of rebleeding."

After protamine, all patients in both groups had significant coagulopathy (P< or = 0.05 versus baseline). There were fewer patients receiving transfusions of fresh frozen plasma (FPP) in the intervention group, when compared to the control group (P< or = 0.05). Patients receiving BP spent less time in theatre to achieve haemostasis (P< or = 0.05), had a lesser amount of bleeding intraoperatively (P< or = 0.01), at 4h (P< or = 0.05) and at 24h (P< or = 0.05), required a lower amount of transfusions of red cells (P< or = 0.01), FPP (P< or = 0.05) and platelets (P< or = 0.05).

            "abstract": "As a result of the AIDS crisis, public and physician pressure have increased the utilization of autologous blood products. Attitudes about homologous blood transfusion, however, have changed dramatically in recent years. A large segment of the population undergoing elective surgery is elderly and therefore has a significant incidence of cardiovascular disease and a slow response of the erythropoietic system when acute anemia occurs. However, preoperative autologous blood donation programs require 2-5 weeks to complete; the average yield is only 2.2 units per patient. As a consequence, autologous predonation is underused and homologous transfusion cannot be completely avoided in all patients. For several years recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been available and has been successfully used in the treatment of patients with renal anemia. This study evaluated the effect of r-HuEPO on patients with preoperative autologous blood collection. METHODS. Ten patients of both sexes scheduled for hip arthroplasty underwent a preoperative autologous program. During a period of 23 days prior to surgery autologous blood donation was performed with 7.5 ml/kg withdrawal on four occasions, the last one 5 days prior to surgery. Five patients were randomly treated with subcutaneous injections of rHuEPO (Erypo, Cilag GmbH, Sulzbach; Distributor: Fresenius AG, Oberursel, FRG) 200 IU/kg seven times, starting 3 days after the first blood withdrawal. All patients (n = 10) received oral iron therapy with iron sulphate 304 mg/die (= 100 mg iron/die). Patients with hypertension or recent myocardial infarction were excluded from the study. The hemoglobin level before donation had to be at least 11.0 g/dl. On each study day, a complete blood count and platelets, differential, and reticulocyte count were determined by standard methods as were transferrin, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity. Blood loss and blood consumption during and after the operation were registered. The indication for blood transfusion (autologous/homologous) was based on hemoglobin values, which were not acceptable below 8.5 g/dl. RESULTS. No side effects of rHuEPO treatment were observed. Blood loss ranged from 650 to 1100 ml intraoperatively and 400 to 950 ml postoperatively with no differences between the groups. Patients with rHuEPO had no autologous red cell concentrates (aRCC) during the operation; two of them had two units of aRCC on the 2nd postoperative day. Two of the patients in the control group had intraoperative blood transfusions (2 and 3 units aRCC, respectively); all patients in this group were transfused postoperatively: 12 of the 20 units collected were utilized. At the onset of the operation the mean hemoglobin value in patients with rHuEPO was 13.5 +/- 0.4 g/dl compared to 11.3 +/- 0.3 g/dl in the controls. Reticulocytes increased significantly during the investigation period. On the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th days of autologous blood collection and before the onset of surgery, the number of reticulocytes was significantly greater in rHuEPO patients than in the controls. Further laboratory variables such as transferrin, ferritin, and total iron-binding capacity did not change significantly during the investigation period; there were no significant differences between the two groups. DISCUSSION. The results of the present study show that rHuEPO leads to an increase in reticulocytes with maintenance of hemoglobin levels during the phlebotomy program. As a consequence, patients with anemia and particular contraindications to homologous blood derivatives (irregular antibodies, Jehovah's Witnesses) may be able to undergo major surgery successfully. The possibility of shortening the intervals between phlebotomies would seem to be of major advantage; our data also suggest that an aggressive autologous blood collection program would increase yields over present programs. In our institute a minimum hemoglobin level of 11.5 g/dl is accepted for autologous donation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Platelet transport towards the vessel wall is influenced by the hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) size, and shape. Recent in vitro studies have indicated that RBC deformability may also influence platelet transport. The observation that isoxsuprine, a known vasodilating drug, caused increased RBC deformability in vitro and decreased platelet transport in vitro prompted us to study the effects of this drug in vivo. The study was performed in a double-blind cross-over study of isoxsuprine v placebo in ten patients with peripheral arterial insufficiency. RBC deformability was estimated from viscosity measurements using the blood viscosity equation of Dintenfass and expressed as T value. Platelet transport was studied in an annular perfusion chamber according to Baumgartner. Human umbilical arteries were used as blood vessels. Perfusion studies were performed with whole blood or with RBCs of the patients mixed with normal platelets and plasma at a standardized hematocrit and platelet count. An increase in RBC deformability concomitant with a decrease in platelet adherence was observed in patients on isoxsuprine with a drop in T value of approximately 0.06 (from 0.91 toward 0.86), and a concomitant decrease in platelet adherence of 20% to 40%. These observations differed significantly from the results in the placebo group and showed a significant group-period interaction at the cross-over of medication (analysis of variance). The effects on platelet adherence were observed at high vessel wall shear rate (1,800 s-1) with perfusates consisting of patients' RBCs and donor plasma and platelets at standardized hematocrit and platelet count. No differences were observed under these conditions at a shear rate of 300 s-1. When whole blood of patients was used, nonsignificant effect was observed at shear rates of 300 s-1 and 1,800 s-1. This was probably caused by the added noise due to variations in hematocrit and platelet number. These data demonstrate that isoxsuprine increases RBC deformability, and they suggest the possibility of decreasing platelet-vessel wall interaction in vivo by manipulation of RBC deformability."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPreoperative transfusions are frequently given to prevent perioperative morbidity in patients with sickle cell anemia. There is no consensus, however, on the best regimen of transfusions for this purpose.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a multicenter study to compare the rates of perioperative complications among patients randomly assigned to receive either an aggressive transfusion regimen designed to decrease the hemoglobin S level to less than 30 percent (group 1) or a conservative regimen designed to increase the hemoglobin level to 10 g per deciliter (group 2).\n## RESULTS\nPatients undergoing a total of 604 operations were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2. The severity of the disease, compliance with the protocol, and the types of operations were similar in the two groups. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 11 g per deciliter in group 1 and 10.6 g per deciliter in group 2. The preoperative value for hemoglobin S was 31 percent in group 1 and 59 percent in group 2. The most frequent operations were cholecystectomies (232), head and neck surgery (156), and orthopedic surgery (72). With the exception of transfusion-related complications, which occurred in 14 percent of the operations in group 1 and in 7 percent of those in group 2, the frequency of serious complications was similar in the two groups (31 percent in group 1 and 35 percent in group 2). The acute chest syndrome developed in 10 percent of both groups and resulted in two deaths in group 1. A history of pulmonary disease and a higher risk associated with surgery were significant predictors of the acute chest syndrome.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA conservative transfusion regimen was as effective as an aggressive regimen in preventing perioperative complications in patients with sickle cell anemia, and the conservative approach resulted in only half as many transfusion-associated complications.\n"

            "abstract": "Allogeneic blood transfusions in surgical patients have been associated with an increased risk of infectious complications and organ dysfunction. Residual leukocytes contaminating units of packed red blood cells have been incriminated through the induction of anergy and/or a potentiated inflammatory response, leading to the possibility that leukoreduced red blood cell transfusion might mitigate these effects. We set out to evaluate the effect of leukoreduced red cell transfusion on the risk of infections complications in patients requiring transfusion following injury. We conducted a single-center, double-blinded randomized controlled trial of leukoreduced versus standard, nonleukoreduced red blood cell transfusions in injured patients receiving transfusion within 24 hrs of injury. The primary endpoint was infectious complications within 28 days of randomization. Secondary end points were multiple organ failure, length of stay, febrile episodes, and mortality. Two hundred sixty eight subjects were eligible for analysis. Rates of infectious complications were similar in subjects receiving leukoreduced transfusions (30%) or standard transfusions (36%) ([RR], 0.84 [0.55-1.3]) and there was no statistically significant effect of leukoreduced blood transfusion on mortality [RR, 1.20 (0.74-1.9)], febrile episodes [RR, 1.01 (0.89-1.2)], or organ dysfunction scores (5.9 vs. 6.6; P=0.29). Thus, pre-storage leukoreduction of allogeneic red blood cells had a small, but non-significant effect on the rate of infectious complication in this high-risk population requiring transfusion. There was no effect on the rates of febrile episodes, mortality, length of stay, or severity of organ dysfunction."

Six hundred eighty-eight patients were randomized to treatment with HBOC-201 (H, n = 350) or PRBC (R, n = 338) at the first transfusion decision. Primary endpoints were transfusion avoidance and blinded assessment [Mann-Whitney estimator (MW)] of safety noninferiority.

Assessments took place before randomisation, at 10 weeks (in a random 50% subsample of participants), 6 months and 1 year in the leisure centre and walking arms.

There were significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in all groups at each assessment point compared with baseline. There were also significant and sustained improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and leg extensor power, and small reductions in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in all groups, but there were no consistent differences between the groups for any parameter over time. All three groups showed improvement in anxiety and mental well-being scores 6 months after the beginning of the trial. Leisure centre and walking groups maintained this improvement at 1 year. There were no differences between groups. Costs to the participants amounted to pound 100 for the leisure centre scheme and pound 84 for the walking scheme, while provider costs were pound 186 and pound 92, respectively.

The inclusion of supervised exercise classes or walks as a formal component of the scheme may not be more effective than the provision of information about their availability. On cost-effectiveness grounds, assessment and advice alone from an exercise specialist may be appropriate to initiate action in the first instance. Subsidised schemes may be best concentrated on patients at higher absolute risk, or with specific conditions for which particular programmes may be beneficial. Walking appears to be as effective as leisure centre classes and is cheaper. Efforts should be directed towards maintenance of increased activity, with proven measures such as telephone support. Further research should include an updated meta-analysis of published exercise interventions using the standardised mean difference approach."

            "abstract": "We have prospectively evaluated the efficacy of an individualized pre-operative blood saving protocol in elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The primary aim was to obtain a pre-operative haemoglobin (Hb) level of > or =14 g dL(-1). A reduction in requirements for allogeneic transfusion was considered the second aim. Several strategies are available for increasing pre-operative Hb levels and reducing red blood cell (RBC) transfusions following THA or TKA, but the success of these programmes depends on selecting the most appropriate treatment for each patient. Three hundred and five patients with an indication of elective THA or TKA were individually assigned to the following strategies according to Hb and ferritin levels and medical conditions: (a) no pre-operative intervention, (b) oral iron therapy, (c) intravenous (i.v.) iron therapy, (d) recombinant human erythropoietin alpha with i.v. iron and (e) pre-operative autologous donation (PAD) plus oral iron. Eighty-two percent of the patients reached a pre-operative Hb level of > or =14 g dL(-1) compared with 62% of patients with Hb levels of > or =14 g dL(-1) at the baseline visit. Treatment with PAD showed a significant reduction in the pre-operative Hb levels. The rate of RBC transfusion was 18.8% compared with 31.5% of matched historic group (P < 0.001). In conclusion, all patients scheduled to undergo THA or TKA should be candidates for an individualized pre-operative blood salvage programme."

            "abstract": "Intracerebral haemorrhage accounts for 10-15% of strokes and is associated with high mortality and severe disability in survivors. Despite its seriousness, the treatment options for intracerebral haemorrhage are limited. Measures aimed at decreasing elevated intracranial pressure are of limited effectiveness. This has stimulated an interest in attempting to improve the prognosis of intracerebral haemorrhage by addressing the haematoma directly, either removing it by surgical means or limiting its early spontaneous growth. The international Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH), which randomized subjects with intracerebral haemorrhage within 72 h of symptom onset to medical management vs. surgery, failed to document the superiority of one treatment over the other, when compared with regard to mortality and functional outcome at 90 days. The subgroup of patients with lobar haematomas located at a depth of 1 cm or less from the cortical surface fared better with surgery than with medical management. A similar comparison trial is planned for this subgroup of patients. The neutral results of The international Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH) prompted the assessment of haemostatic therapies, based on the observation that haematomas often enlarge substantially in the hours that follow the onset of symptoms. Recombinant activated factor VII has been shown in a phase IIb, dose-finding trial to result in a significant reduction of haematoma growth, and both mortality and functional scales trended in favour of recombinant activated factor VIIa. The main complication of this therapy was arterial thromboembolic events (myocardial infarction and ischaemic stroke). A phase III randomized trial has recently been completed."

The conventional treatment of intraventricular hemorrhage consists of ventricular drainage or surgical evacuation, but neither of them is encouraged. The objective of this article is to compare different surgical procedures in order to evaluate a method of minimally invasive treatment for intraventricular hemorrhage.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Neuroendoscopy was applied to treat 22 cases of intraventricular hemorrhage. Twenty cases of the same disease that were treated by external ventricular drainage were taken as a control and comparison.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All patients were followed up for 2 months. In the neuroendoscopy group, according to the Glasgow outcome scale, the result was excellent in 5 cases, good in 9, fair in 4, poor in 2 and death in 2. In the external ventricular drainage group, the result was excellent in 1 case, good in 5, fair in 7, poor in 5 and death in 2. More patients in the neuroendoscopy group showed good recovery after 2 months of surgery (p < 0.05). The difference in mortality rate between the 2 groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Neuroendoscopic neurosurgery for intraventricular hemorrhage offers better surgical treatment because it is characterized by visualized manipulation, effective hemorrhage evacuation and excellent postoperative outcomes."

In this study we investigated GC performance over time during implementation of GC strategies within three intensive care units (ICUs) and in routine clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      All adult critically ill patients who stayed for >24 h between 1999 and 2007 were included. Effects of implementing local GC guidelines and guideline revisions on effectiveness/efficiency-related indicators, safety-related indicators, and protocol-related indicators were measured.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data of 17,111 patient admissions were evaluated, with 714,141 available blood glucose levels (BGL) measurements. Mean BGL, time to reach target, hyperglycemia index, sampling frequency, percentage of hyperglycemia events, and in-range measurements statistically changed after introducing GC in all ICUs. The introduction of simple rules on GC had the largest effect. Subsequent changes in the protocol had a smaller effect than the introduction of the protocol itself. As soon as the protocol was introduced, in all ICUs the percentage of hypoglycemia events increased. Various revisions were implemented to reduce hypoglycemia events, but levels never returned to those from pre-implementation. More intensive implementation strategies including the use of a decision support system resulted in better control of the process.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There are various strategies to achieve GC in routine clinical practice but with variable success. All of them were associated with an increase in hypoglycemia events, but GC was never stopped. Instead, these events have been accepted and managed. Statistical process control is a useful tool for monitoring phenomena over time and captures within-institution changes."

The benefits and toxicity of hydroxychloroquine sulfate in 120 patients with rheumatoid arthritis of less than 2 years duration are assessed.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      A 36-week randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at two university centers and four community rheumatology private practices. Patients had to have had their disease for less than 2 years and to have never received a second-line drug. Patients were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or an equivalent number of placebo tablets in a dose of up to 7 mg/kg per day (maximum 400 mg/day). The initial dose was half the maximum dose and, if after 2 weeks of treatment there had been no side effects, the full dose was prescribed. There were four a priori primary outcomes: (1) a joint index composed of the tender joint count, the swollen joint count, the grip strength, and the duration of morning stiffness; (2) a pain index composed of the pain dimension of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) and the visual analog pain scale of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ); (3) a physical function index composed of the HAQ, the physical disability dimension of the AIMS, and the McMaster-Toronto Arthritis Patient Performance Disability Questionnaire; (4) the psychological function subscale of the AIMS. Secondary outcomes included adverse events, patient and physician global assessments, hematocrit, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and corticosteroid usage. An intent-to-treat analysis assessed improvement at 36 weeks by Student's t-test and average improvement over the course of the study by analysis of variance for repeated measures.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of 148 eligible patients, 120 were randomized. The characteristics of those randomized to hydroxychloroquine compared to placebo were similar at the study onset.

There was no improvement in psychological function for hydroxychloroquine compared to placebo (P = 0.837 at 36 weeks, P = 0.89 over the course of the study). Among the secondary outcomes there was significant improvement only in the patient's (P = 0.01) and the outcome assessor's (P = 0.03) assessment of change and a trend towards a fewer number of intra-articular corticosteroid injections (P = 0.05) in the hydroxychloroquine-treated group. There were no important differences in the side effects between hydroxychloroquine or placebo.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Over 36 weeks, hydroxychloroquine had a significant benefit on synovitis, pain, and physical disability of recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis, but did not benefit psychological function."

Fifty-eight men and women, aged from 45-69 years, with blood pressure levels between 100 and 120 mm Hg were matched for age, sex, and blood pressure levels with 58 control patients. The maintenance of diastolic blood pressures at levels below 100 mm Hg was successfully carried out without serious drug side effects. Treatment effectively maintained diastolic pressures below 100 mm Hg, but no effect was shown on other terminating events. Few problems were found in the management of patients with minimally raised blood pressure, most of whom were symptom-free. The treatment and control groups became less comparable as increasing numbers of patients in the control group were withdrawn from the trial as diastolic pressures rose above 130 mm Hg."

            "abstract": "Untreated pain during the transportation of patients after minor trauma is a common problem in emergency medicine. Because paramedics usually are not allowed to perform invasive procedures or to give drugs for pain treatment, a noninvasive, nondrug-based method would be helpful. Acupressure is a traditional Chinese treatment for pain that is based on pain relief followed by a short mechanical stimulation of specific points. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that effective pain therapy is possible by paramedics who are trained in acupressure. In a double-blinded trial we included 60 trauma patients. We randomly assigned them into three groups (\"true points,\" \"sham-points,\" and \"no acupressure\"). An independent observer, blinded to the treatment assignment, recorded vital variables and visual analog scales for pain and anxiety before and after treatment. At the end of transport, we asked for ratings of overall satisfaction. For statistical evaluation, one-way analysis of variance and the Scheffé F test were used. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Morphometric and demographic data and potential confounding factors such as age, sex, pain, anxiety, blood pressure, and heart rate before treatment did not differ among the groups.

Our results show that acupressure is an effective and simple-to-learn treatment of pain in emergency trauma care and leads to an improvement of the quality of care in emergency transport.

Between 11 September, 1991 to 10 September, 1992, 66 women with previous caesarean section were given a trial of scar. The main pre-requests to allow a trial of scar were: only one previous lower uterine segment section, a cephalic presentation with no disproportion in the current labour and, the presence of a functional operating theatre. Labour was being monitored by checking the uterine contractions by fundal palpation and counting the Foetal heart rate (FHR) using the Pinnard Stethoscope. Compatible blood was prior prepared in only 7 (10.6%) labours. Forty seven (71.2%) parturients delivered vaginally. In 19 (28.2%) an emergency repeat section was done for failure of progress in labour. In one (1.5%) patient, a uterine scar dehiscence was detected. The 5th minute APGAR score was 7/10 or more in 64 (94.1%) and 6/10 in 3 (4.5%) of 68 neonates. There was one prepartum intra-uterine foetal death and one neonatal death of a preterm baby making the perinatal mortality rate (PNMR) of 29.4 per thousand. There was no maternal death.

With the increasing popularity of artificial blood substitutes (ABS), which solely provide oxygen-transport capacity, this issue becomes even more complex. We developed a mathematical model to quantitatively analyze hemostasis during hemodilution and validated it by recalculating patient data. We calculated and compared maximal allowable blood losses (MABL) related to minimal acceptable hematocrit, platelet concentration, and plasma fibrinogen concentration. MABL is the maximal blood loss that can be tolerated without any additional blood products. The variable with the smallest MABL thus limits hemodilution foremost. Hemodilution included isovolemic replacement of blood loss with colloid or acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) followed by isovolemic replacement of blood loss with colloid and ABS. We also related our findings to preoperative patient data (n = 204). The decline in platelet concentrations rarely (<2% of all patients) limits hemodilution. By contrast, critical plasma fibrinogen (< or =100 mg/dL) concentrations can often (< or =20% of all patients) limit hemodilution if their initial concentrations are within the lower normal range (<300 mg/dL). These findings become more frequent if ANH is combined with ABS. Under those circumstances ANH blood products are solely required for stabilization of hemostasis, thereby defeating the original purpose of combining ANH with ABS.\n    \n\n\n          Implications:\n        \n      \n      The causes of quantitative changes of hemostasis during hemodilution, as well as their clinical effect and relevance, remain unclear.

A current example of this problem is the study of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa), which has attracted considerable interest as a systemic procoagulant agent for use in trauma patients with exsanguinating hemorrhage.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To report on the implementation of an international trial - CONTROL - intended to assess the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in trauma, and discuss trauma research study design in light of this experience.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The CONTROL trial international steering committee confronted a number of barriers in the design of the CONTROL trial. They addressed methodologies for (1) standardizing entry criteria for trauma patients suffering inherently heterogeneous injuries, (2) obtaining informed consent in an acutely injured population with altered levels of consciousness, (3) avoiding futile care, while recruiting subjects with incompletely diagnosed injuries, (4) standardizing trauma intensive care across different investigating sites and countries, and (5) establishing study endpoints that were both clinically relevant and convincing to regulatory authorities. The resulting study methodology is reported.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The CONTROL trial began active recruitment in October 2005, and was halted on June 11, 2008 because the observed mortality in the 576 enrolled patients was so far below expectations that the study would lack sufficient statistical power at the planned number of subjects to demonstrate a benefit. The utility of the endpoints selected for study will not be known until completion of data analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      Any clinical trial in trauma patients must cope with the urgency of care required, issues of patient heterogeneity, standardization of care across multiple centers, and the difficulties of obtaining informed consent.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Research in acutely hemorrhaging trauma patients presents numerous scientific and ethical challenges.

The laser system proved both simple and safe in use. Initial haemostasis was achieved by the laser in 10 of 15 'spurting vessels', but four of 13 'control' spurting vessels also stopped bleeding spontaneously. Overall, there were no statistically significant differences between the laser treated and control groups in terms of rebleeding, the need for surgical intervention, or death.

When the patients were arousable and their vital signs stable in the intensive care unit, the authors administered nalbuphine or placebo (randomly and double-blinded) until extubation criteria were met, and subsequently gave nalbuphine for analgesia. In one of ten placebo patients, tracheal extubation was accomplished without nalbuphine. This patient then retained CO2 and required nalbuphine; the other nine placebo patients could not be extubated after placebo trials and were given nalbuphine. In all other patients in both groups, tracheal extubation was successful following nalbuphine (median dose 60 micrograms/kg, range 30-180 micrograms/kg). One patient became renarcotized 4 h after tracheal extubation without an increase in plasma fentanyl concentration; he received an additional dose of nalbuphine and recovered without further incident. Nine patients required treatment with vasoactive agents or beta-blockers for hypertension or tachycardia associated with the administration of nalbuphine. Eight of 18 patients were not satisfied with nalbuphine analgesia, and required morphine for relief of their pain. Recurrent elevations of fentanyl concentrations in plasma were observed and appeared to be related to increasing motor activity. Nalbuphine is an effective opioid antagonist after fentanyl anesthesia, but its use is associated with side effects, and analgesia for the post-sternotomy patient may be unsatisfactory unless the dose is carefully titrated to the minimum required to antagonize respiratory depression."

Secondary measures included blood pressure goal attainment (<140/90 mmHg), hypertension-related knowledge, medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring, resource utilization, quality of life, and satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 463 subjects were enrolled (n = 233 control, n = 230 intervention). Subjects receiving the intervention achieved significantly lower systolic (p = 0.007) and diastolic (p = 0.002) blood pressures compared to control (137/75 mmHg vs. 143/78 mmHg). In addition, 62% of intervention subjects achieved target blood pressure compared to 44% of control subjects (p = 0.003). The intervention group received more total office visits (7.2 vs. 4.9, p < 0.0001), however had fewer physician visits (3.2 vs. 4.7, p < 0.0001) compared to control. Intervention subjects were prescribed more antihypertensive medications (2.7 vs. 2.4, p = 0.02), but did not take more antihypertensive pills per day (2.4 vs. 2.5, p = 0.87). There were minimal differences between groups in hypertension-related knowledge, medication adherence, quality of life, or satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients randomized to collaborative primary care-pharmacist hypertension management achieved significantly better blood pressure control compared to usual care with no difference in quality of life or satisfaction."

Of the 24 patients whose data could be evaluated, four (29%) of 14 responded well to fluoxymesterone therapy (hemoglobin level rise, of greater than 2 to greater than 10 g/dL and relief of symptoms of anemia), whereas, in the transfusion arm, there were no good \"responders\"; one of ten patients was a partial \"remitter\" (responder), with a rise in the hemoglobin level of 1 to 2 g/dL. All responders to fluoxymesterone therapy showed a 50% or more maximum uptake of injected ferrous citrate Fe 59 into RBC hemoglobin, whereas no nonresponder met this criterion. All responders had MF (marrow more than one third replaced by collagen). There was no significant difference in survival of patients in the two arms of the study."

Both are selected based on definite guidelines for clinicoradiological criteria as follows: Endovascular therapy comprising of GDC embolization, CSF wash-out with UK or TP A were performed in cases with Hunt and Kosnik grade 4 (GCS 7, 8), and grade 5 (without hydrocephalus or intracranial hemorrhage), age>70 years, subacute stage (4--14 days of vasospasm), basilar aneurysm and peripheral MCA/PCA aneurysms. Microsurgical clipping with a drainage procedure was performed in cases with Hunt and Kosnik grades 0--3, grade 4 (GCS 9--12), age less than 70 years, grade 5 with hydrocephalus or intracerebral hematoma and acute stage (0--3 days after bleed). The patient's outcome was measured using GOS (Glasgow outcome score) at the time of discharge. In our series of severe (poor grade) SAH cases, 120 cases underwent clipping and 59 cases underwent coiling. Although they accounted for 37.8 % and 48 % of total SAH cases, respectively, the outcome was satisfactory. Good recovery and moderate disability, together termed \"favorable outcome\" was found in 69.16 % of clipping cases and 44.06 % of coiling cases. Clipping had a better outcome than coiling in cases of acute severe SAH in our series. The golden hour resuscitation, pre-hospital care and the adjunctive treatment strategies like hypothermia are discussed. A critical appraisal of the ISAT of microsurgical clipping versus coiling is used for comparison of our results."

One patient died from sudden hemorrhage and a second one underwent further drainage for a residual pelvic abscess. In the 32 alive patients, a close watch over with ultrasound and CT scan gave prominence to a complete disappearance of the lesions within 4 to 24 weeks. The nonoperative management of such hepatic injuries may be a safe and reasonable alternative to a high risk surgery, as far as the hemodynamic condition or associated visceral lesions do not require an emergency surgery."
