            "criteria": "Study selection was conducted through independent review. Two teams of independent reviewers (J. R. and D. D.; L. K. and M. A. M. R.) examined abstracts for eligibility based on study design (randomized trial) and comparators (RBC transfusion strategies). To divide the work effort, the first team reviewed entries prior to February 6, 2013, and the second team reviewed entries from February 6, 2013, to January 22, 2014. For publications with team member disagreement, the full-text articles were obtained and eligibility was determined through consensus. Trials that did not contain infectious outcomes were excluded, as well as studies with duplicate samples, ineligible comparators, and studies that described the methods of the trials but did not report results.",
