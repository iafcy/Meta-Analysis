            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nThere is controversy regarding the application of transfusion triggers in cardiac surgery. The goal of this study was to determine if lowering the hemoglobin threshold for red cell (RBC) transfusion to 8 g per dL after coronary artery bypass graft surgery would reduce blood use without adversely affecting patient outcome.\n## STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS\nConsecutive patients (n = 428) undergoing elective primary coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomly assigned to two groups: study patients (n = 212) received RBC transfusions in the postoperative period if the Hb level was < 8 g per dL or if predetermined clinical conditions required RBC support, and control patients (n = 216) were treated according to individual physician's orders (hemoglobin levels < 9 g/dL as the institutional guideline). Multiple demographic, procedure-related, transfusion, laboratory, and outcome data were analyzed. Questionnaires were administered for patient self-assessment of fatigue and anemia.\n## RESULTS\nPreoperative and operative clinical characteristics, as well as the intraoperative transfusion rate, were similar for both groups. There was a significant difference between the postoperative RBC transfusion rates in study (0.9 +/- 1.5 RBC units) and control (1.4 +/- 1.8 RBC units) groups (p = 0.005). There was no difference in clinical outcome, including morbidity and mortality rates, in the two groups; group scores for self-assessment of fatigue and anemia were also similar.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA lower Hb threshold of 8 g per dL does not adversely affect patient outcome. Moreover, RBC resources can be saved without increased risk to the patient.\n",

            "abstract": "Red blood cell transfusion is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, observational data suggest that this practice may be associated with worse clinical outcomes and data from clinical trials are lacking in this population. We conducted a prospective multicenter randomized pilot trial in which 45 patients with AMI and a hematocrit level \u226430% were randomized to a liberal (transfuse when hematocrit <30% to maintain 30% to 33%) or a conservative (transfuse when hematocrit <24% to maintain 24% to 27%) transfusion strategy. Baseline hematocrit was similar in those in the liberal and conservative arms (26.9% vs 27.5%, p = 0.4). Average daily hematocrits were 30.6% in the liberal arm and 27.9% in the conservative arm, a difference of 2.7% (p <0.001). More patients in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm were transfused (100% vs 54%, p <0.001) and the average number of units transfused per patient tended to be higher in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm (2.5 vs 1.6, p = 0.07). The primary clinical safety measurement of in-hospital death, recurrent MI, or new or worsening congestive heart failure occurred in 8 patients in the liberal arm and 3 in the conservative arm (38% vs 13%, p = 0.046). In conclusion, compared to a conservative transfusion strategy, treating anemic patients with AMI according to a liberal transfusion strategy results in more patients receiving transfusions and higher hematocrit levels. However, this may be associated with worse clinical outcomes. A large-scale definitive trial addressing this issue is urgently required.\n",

Because a definitive trial will require thousands of patients, and because there is variability in transfusion practices, a pilot study was undertaken to determine adherence to proposed strategies.\n## STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS\nA single-center parallel randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted in high-risk cardiac patients to assess adherence to two transfusion strategies. Fifty patients were randomly assigned either to a \"restrictive\" transfusion strategy (RBCs if their Hb concentration was 70 g/L or less intraoperatively during cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] and 75 g/L or less postoperatively) or a \"liberal\" transfusion strategy (RBCs if their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or less during CPB and less than 100 g/L postoperatively).\n## RESULTS\nThe percentage of adherence overall was 84% in the restrictive arm and 41% in the liberal arm. Twenty-two (88%) patients were transfused 99 units of RBCs in the liberal group compared to 13 patients who were transfused 50 units in the restrictive group (p<0.01). There were no significant differences in individual adverse outcomes; however, more adverse events occurred in the restrictive group (38 vs. 15, p<0.01).\n## CONCLUSION\nAdherence to the evaluated interventions is vital to all randomized controlled trials as it has the potential to affect outcomes. Further pilot studies are required to optimize enrollment and transfusion adherence before a definitive study is conducted.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nRed cell transfusion is commonly used in orthopaedic surgery. Evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy may be safe for most patients. However, concern has been raised over the risks of anaemia in those with ischaemic cardiac disease. Perioperative silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) has a relatively high incidence in the elderly population undergoing elective surgery. This study used Holter monitoring to compare the effect of a restrictive and a liberal red cell transfusion strategy on the incidence of SMI in patients without signs or symptoms of ischaemic heart disease who were undergoing lower limb arthroplasty.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe performed a multicentre, controlled trial in which 260 patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery were enrolled and randomized to transfusion triggers that were either restrictive (8 g/dl) or liberal (10 g/dl). Participants were monitored with continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) (Holter monitoring), preoperatively for 12 h and postoperatively for 72 h. The tapes were analysed for new ischaemia by technicians blinded to treatment. The total ischaemia time in minutes was divided by the recording time in hours and an ischaemic load in min/h was calculated. Haemoglobin levels were measured preoperatively, postoperatively in the recovery room, and on days one, three and five after surgery.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean postoperative haemoglobin concentration was 9.87 g/dl in the restrictive group and 11.09 g/dl in the liberal group. In the restrictive group, 34% were transfused a total of 89 red cell units, and in the liberal group 43% were given a total of 119 red cell units. A postoperative episode of silent ischaemia was experienced by 21/109 (19%) patients in the restrictive group and by 26/109 (24%) patients in the liberal group [mean difference -4.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -15.5% to 6%, P = 0.41). There was no significant difference (P = 0.53) between the overall ischaemic load in the restrictive group (median 0 min/h, range 0-4.18) and the liberal group (median 0 min/h, range 0-19.48). In those patients who did experience postoperative SMI, the mean ischaemic load was 0.48 min/h in the restrictive group and 1.51 min/h in the liberal group (ratio 0.32, 95% CI: 0.14-0.76, P = 0.011). The median postoperative length of hospital stay in the restrictive group was 7.3 days [range 5-11; interquartile range (IQR) 6-8] compared with 7.5 days (range 5-13; IQR 7-8) in the liberal group. The numbers were not large enough to conclude equivalence.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn patients without preoperative evidence of myocardial ischaemia undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery, a restrictive transfusion strategy seems unlikely to be associated with an increased incidence of SMI. A proportion of these patients experience moderate SMI, regardless of the transfusion trigger. Use of a restrictive transfusion strategy did not increase length of hospital stay, and use of this strategy would lead to a significant reduction in red cell transfusion in orthopaedic surgery. Our data did not indicate any potential for harm in employing such a strategy in patients with no prior evidence of cardiac ischaemia who were undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPerioperative anemia leads to increased morbidity and mortality and potentially inhibits rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery. As such, the optimum transfusion threshold after hip fracture surgery is unknown.\n## PATIENTS AND METHODS\nA total of 120 elderly, cognitively intact hip fracture patients admitted from their own home were randomly assigned to receive transfusion at a hemoglobin threshold of 10.0 g per dL (liberal) versus 8.0 g per dL (restrictive) in the entire perioperative period. Patients were treated according to a well-defined multimodal rehabilitation program. Primary outcome was postoperative functional mobility measured with the cumulated ambulation score (CAS).\n## RESULTS\nPatients in the liberal group received transfusions more frequently than those in the restrictive group (44 patients vs. 22 patients; p < 0.01) and received more transfusions during hospitalization (median, 2 units [interquartile range, 1-2] vs. 1 [1-2]; p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in postoperative rehabilitation scores (CAS: median, 9 [9-15] vs. 9 [9-13.5]; p = 0.46) or in length of stay (median, 18 days vs. 16 days, respectively; p = 0.46). There were fewer patients in the liberal transfusion group with cardiovascular complications (2% vs. 10%; p = 0.05) and a lower mortality (0% vs. 8%; p = 0.02).\n## CONCLUSION\nAlthough a liberal transfusion trigger did not result in increased ambulation scores, restrictive transfusion thresholds should be treated with caution in elderly high-risk hip fracture patients, until their safety has been proved in larger randomized studies.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nIn elective orthopaedic hip- and knee replacement surgery patients, we studied the effect of implementation of a uniform transfusion policy on RBC usage.\n## STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS\nA randomized, controlled study. A new uniform, restrictive transfusion policy was compared with standard care, which varied among the three participating hospitals. Only prestorage leucocyte-depleted RBC(s) were used. Primary end-point was RBC usage, related to length of hospital stay. Secondary end-points were Hb levels, mobilization delay and postoperative complications.\n## RESULTS\nSix hundred and three patients were evaluated. Adherence to the protocol was over 95%. Overall mean RBC usage was 0.78 U/patient in the new policy group and 0.86 U/patient in the standard care policy group (mean difference 0.08;95% CI [-0.3; 0.2]; P = 0.53). In two hospitals, the new transfusion policy resulted in a RBC reduction of 30% (0.58U RBC/patient) (P = 0.17) and 41% (0.29 U RBC/patient) (P = 0.05) respectively. In the third hospital, however, RBC usage increased by 39% (0.31 U RBC/patient) (P = 0.02) with the new policy, due to a more restrictive standard care policy in that hospital. Length of hospital stay was not influenced by either policy.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nImplementation of a uniform transfusion protocol for elective lower joint arthroplasty patients is feasible, but does not always lead to a RBC reduction. Length of hospital stay was not affected.\n",

We conducted a randomized trial to determine whether a higher threshold for blood transfusion would improve recovery in patients who had undergone surgery for hip fracture.\n## METHODS\nWe enrolled 2016 patients who were 50 years of age or older, who had either a history of or risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and whose hemoglobin level was below 10 g per deciliter after hip-fracture surgery. We randomly assigned patients to a liberal transfusion strategy (a hemoglobin threshold of 10 g per deciliter) or a restrictive transfusion strategy (symptoms of anemia or at physician discretion for a hemoglobin level of <8 g per deciliter). The primary outcome was death or an inability to walk across a room without human assistance on 60-day follow-up.\n## RESULTS\nA median of 2 units of red cells were transfused in the liberal-strategy group and none in the restrictive-strategy group. The rates of the primary outcome were 35.2% in the liberal-strategy group and 34.7% in the restrictive-strategy group (odds ratio in the liberal-strategy group, 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.22), for an absolute risk difference of 0.5 percentage points (95% CI, -3.7 to 4.7). The rates of in-hospital acute coronary syndrome or death were 4.3% and 5.2%, respectively (absolute risk difference, -0.9%; 99% CI, -3.3 to 1.6), and rates of death on 60-day follow-up were 7.6% and 6.6%, respectively (absolute risk difference, 1.0%; 99% CI, -1.9 to 4.0). The rates of other complications were similar in the two groups.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA liberal transfusion strategy, as compared with a restrictive strategy, did not reduce rates of death or inability to walk independently on 60-day follow-up or reduce in-hospital morbidity in elderly patients at high cardiovascular risk.

Non-inferiority was demonstrated if the physical fatigue difference between study arms was maximal 1.3. Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life and physical complications. Health-related quality of life questionnaires were completed at five time-points until 6 weeks postpartum.\n## RESULTS\nIn all, 521 women were randomised to non-intervention (n = 262) or RBC transfusion (n = 259). Mean physical fatigue score at day 3 postpartum, adjusted for baseline and mode of delivery, was 0.8 lower in the RBC transfusion arm (95% confidence interval: 0.1-1.5, P = 0.02) and at 1 week postpartum was 1.06 lower (95% confidence interval: 0.3-1.8, P = 0.01). A median of two RBC units was transfused in the RBC transfusion arm. In the non-intervention arm, 33 women received RBC transfusion, mainly because of anaemic symptoms. Physical complications were comparable.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nStatistically, non-inferiority could not be demonstrated as the confidence interval crossed the non-inferiority boundary. Nevertheless, with only a small difference in physical fatigue and no differences in secondary outcomes, implementation of restrictive management seems clinically justified.\n",

No clinically significant differences were found for the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p = .97), for pediatric critical care unit length of stay (p = .74), or for pediatric critical care unit mortality (p = .44) in the restrictive vs. liberal group.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn this subgroup analysis of children with stable sepsis, we found no evidence that a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy, as compared to a liberal one, increased the rate of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Furthermore, a restrictive transfusion threshold significantly reduced exposure to blood products. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe stabilized for children with sepsis, but further studies are required to support this recommendation.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nPreoperative transfusions are frequently given to prevent perioperative morbidity in patients with sickle cell anemia. There is no consensus, however, on the best regimen of transfusions for this purpose.\n## METHODS\nWe conducted a multicenter study to compare the rates of perioperative complications among patients randomly assigned to receive either an aggressive transfusion regimen designed to decrease the hemoglobin S level to less than 30 percent (group 1) or a conservative regimen designed to increase the hemoglobin level to 10 g per deciliter (group 2).\n## RESULTS\nPatients undergoing a total of 604 operations were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2. The severity of the disease, compliance with the protocol, and the types of operations were similar in the two groups. The preoperative hemoglobin level was 11 g per deciliter in group 1 and 10.6 g per deciliter in group 2. The preoperative value for hemoglobin S was 31 percent in group 1 and 59 percent in group 2. The most frequent operations were cholecystectomies (232), head and neck surgery (156), and orthopedic surgery (72). With the exception of transfusion-related complications, which occurred in 14 percent of the operations in group 1 and in 7 percent of those in group 2, the frequency of serious complications was similar in the two groups (31 percent in group 1 and 35 percent in group 2). The acute chest syndrome developed in 10 percent of both groups and resulted in two deaths in group 1. A history of pulmonary disease and a higher risk associated with surgery were significant predictors of the acute chest syndrome.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA conservative transfusion regimen was as effective as an aggressive regimen in preventing perioperative complications in patients with sickle cell anemia, and the conservative approach resulted in only half as many transfusion-associated complications.\n",
