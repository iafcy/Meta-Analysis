Abstract 
Preoperative transfusions are 
frequently given to prevent perioperative morbidity in pa- 
tients with sickle cell anemia. There is no consensus, how- 
ever, on the best regimen of transfusions for this purpose. 
We conducted a multicenter study to com- 
pare the rates of perioperative complications among pa- 
tients randomly assigned to receive either an aggressive 
transfusion regimen designed to decrease the hemoglo- 
bin S level to less than 30 percent (group 1) or a conser- 
vative regimen designed to increase the hemoglobin level 
to 10 g per deciliter (group 2). 

Patients undergoing a total of 604 operations 
were randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2. The se- 
verity of the disease, compliance with the protocol, and 
the types of operations were similar in the two groups. 
The preoperative hemoglobin level was 11 g per deciliter 
in group 1 and 10.6 g per deciliter in group 2. The preop- 
erative value for hemoglobin S was 31 percent in group

reported perioperative mortality rates as high as 10 
percent, and the rate of postoperative complications 
reached 50 percent. 
 These problems may arise 
from perioperative hypoxia, hypoperfusion, and acido- 
sis, which cause erythrocytes to sickle, thus precipitat- 
ing vaso-occlusion and organ dysfunction. To prevent 
these complications, transfusions of red cells are given 
to reduce the proportion of sickle erythrocytes and cor- 
rect the anemia. Various regimens, ranging from con- 
servative (correcting the anemia) to aggressive (lower- 
ing the level of hemoglobin S to less than 30 percent), 
have been used. 
 However, there is no agreement 
on which approach — conservative or aggressive — is 
better suited to the surgical treatment of patients with 
sickle cell anemia. 


In 1988, a multicenter study group began to address 
the question of perioperative care for such patients. 
The objective was to compare prospectively the rates of 
perioperative complications among patients who were 
randomly assigned to an aggressive or a conservative

1 and 59 percent in group 2. The most frequent opera- 
tions were cholecystectomies (232), head and neck sur- 
gery (156), and orthopedic surgery (72). With the excep- 
tion of transfusion-related complications, which occurred 
in 14 percent of the operations in group 1 and in 7 percent 
of those in group 2, the frequency of serious complica- 
tions was similar in the two groups (31 percent in group 
1 and 35 percent in group 2). The acute chest syndrome 
developed in 10 percent of both groups and resulted in 
two deaths in group 1. A history of pulmonary disease and 
a higher risk associated with surgery were signiﬁcant pre- 
dictors of the acute chest syndrome. 

A conservative transfusion regimen was 
as effective as an aggressive regimen in preventing peri- 
operative complications in patients with sickle cell ane- 
mia, and the conservative approach resulted in only half 
as many transfusion-associated complications. (N Engl 
J Med 1995;333:206-13.) 
regimen of transfusions and to determine the factors 
that may predict complications. 
Patients were enrolled at 36 centers. Each institution had a princi- 
pal investigator, surgeon, anesthesiologist, data coordinator, and nurse 
assigned to the study. A protocol was followed from enrollment 
through the follow-up period. 
Patients were eligible for enrollment in the study if they had a di- 
agnosis of sickle cell anemia documented by the presence of hemo- 
globin SS on electrophoresis, were undergoing elective surgery, and 
had not received a transfusion within three months before the sur- 
gery. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo an aggres- 
sive regimen of transfusions designed to maintain a preoperative he- 
moglobin level of 10 g per deciliter (range, 9 to 11) and a hemoglobin 
S level of 30 percent or less (group 1) or a conservative transfusion 
regimen designed to maintain the hemoglobin level at 10 g per deci- 
liter (range, 9 to 11), regardless of the percentage of hemoglobin S 
(group 2). 
From 1988 through 1993, data were collected on 692 surgical pro- 
cedures randomly assigned to group 1 or group 2. Eighty-eight of 
these procedures were subsequently excluded from the study (42 in 
group 1 and 46 in group 2). 
The types of surgery, demographic characteristics of the patients, 
and reasons for elimination from the study (cancellation of the 
surgery, diagnostic error, or refusal of the patient to participate) were 
similar in the two groups. The age distribution of the patients whose 
procedures were excluded was representative of that of the whole 
sample. A total of 551 patients were randomly assigned to group 1 or 
group 2 and underwent a total of 604 operations. Patients who had 
more than one operation were randomly reassigned to a treatment 
group for each subsequent procedure. 
A multidisciplinary committee developed a standardized treatment 
protocol. An anesthesiologist met with each patient the day before 
the surgery. The patients received at least eight hours of preoperative

hydration, with intraoperative monitoring of temperature, blood pres- 
sure, electrocardiographic features, and oxygenation. Postoperative 
care included the administration of oxygen, intravenous hydration, 
and monitoring with pulse oximetry. 
Each patient’s transfusion history was recorded. The presence of 
35 
alloantibodies was determined with standard screening techniques 
at the time of enrollment, before and after each transfusion, and 
when the patient left the study. All patients received blood from do- 
nors who tested negative for hemoglobin SS. Patients with prior fe- 
brile reactions to transfusion received leukocyte-depleted red cells 
(washed or ﬁltered). 
Laboratory studies included serial measurements of hemoglobin 
and hemoglobin S, antiglobulin tests, liver- and renal-function stud- 
ies, and measurement of oxygen saturation. Chest ﬁlms were also ob- 
tained. For each patient, the risk associated with the administration 
of anesthesia was determined on the basis of a scoring system devel- 
oped by the American Society of Anesthesiologists. 
 Each operation 
was classiﬁed as low risk (e.g., repair of inguinal hernia), intermedi- 
ate risk (e.g., intraabdominal surgery), or high risk (e.g., intracranial 
surgery), according to an established risk classiﬁcation for surgical 
procedures. 


All complications occurring from the time of enrollment through- 
out a 30-day follow-up period were monitored and classiﬁed as minor 
(brief temperature elevations and mild wound infections), serious 
(complications requiring prolonged hospitalization), or life-threaten- 
ing. Most complications that developed during surgery or in the re- 
covery room (e.g., hypotension, hypoxia, and major bleeding) were 
classiﬁed as serious. Complications that were speciﬁcally deﬁned in- 
cluded alloimmunization, painful crisis, the acute chest syndrome, 
neurologic events, renal complications, and fever or infection. De- 
tailed information about these events was collected. Alloimmuniza- 
tion was deﬁned as a new, clinically important red-cell antibody. 
Painful crisis was deﬁned as nonsurgical pain lasting longer than 24 
hours and requiring narcotic analgesia. The acute chest syndrome 
was deﬁned as the presence of a new pulmonary inﬁltrate involving 
at least one full segment. A neurologic event was deﬁned as a change 
in neurologic status accompanied by neurologic ﬁndings (e.g., sei- 
zure, coma, or stroke). A renal complication was deﬁned as renal in- 
sufﬁciency, hematuria, or proteinuria (3 
). Fever or infection was de- 
ﬁned as a temperature higher than 38.5ºC or a documented infection 
lasting at least 48 hours. 


 we calculated that a sample 
of 600 patients was required to provide a power of 0.90 to detect a 
50 percent reduction in the rate of complications in group 1 (10 per- 
cent) as compared with group 2 (20 percent). Analysis of complica- 
tions was carried out by comparing the number of operations with 
and without each type of complication in the randomized groups.

risk factors, with the presence or absence of a complication as the pri-

ate relations (P 
0.05) to the event. Since 9 percent of the patients 
underwent more than one procedure, we adjusted all signiﬁcance lev- 
els in the logistic regressions, using the model proposed by Zeger and 
 to account for the correlation with the outcome. Data on pa- 
Liang 
tients’ characteristics, transfusions, perioperative management, and 
complications were compared between groups. A chi-square or Fish- 
er’s exact test for proportions was used, conﬁdence intervals were 
two-sided, and a P value of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate 
statistical signiﬁcance.

vative transfusion regimen). There was no signiﬁcant 
difference in the demographic or clinical characteris- 
tics of the patients in the two groups, except for a high- 
er incidence of central nervous system disease in group 
1 (Table 1). 
The average hemoglobin values were similar in 
groups 1 and 2: 8 and 7.9 g per deciliter, respectively, 
at the time of enrollment and 11 and 10.6 g per decili- 
ter, respectively, before surgery. The median preopera- 
tive value for hemoglobin S was 31 percent in group 1 
and 59 percent in group 2. Seventy-seven percent of the 
patients in group 2 received a single transfusion before 
surgery. In contrast, 57 percent of the patients in group 
1 underwent exchange transfusions, and 30 percent re- 
ceived repeated transfusions to decrease the percent- 
age of hemoglobin S. The patients in group 1 received 
an average of 5.0 units; children (age, birth to 9 years) 
A total of 551 patients (278 in group 1 and 273 in 
group 2) underwent 604 operations; 303 procedures

of 6.1 units. The average in group 2 was 2.5 units; chil- 
dren received an average of 1.5 units, and adults 3.3 
units. Seventy-two percent of the transfusions in group 
1 and 62 percent of those in group 2 involved leuko- 
cyte-depleted red cells. 
The distribution of preoperative values for hemoglo- 
bin S in the two groups overlapped. In group 1, 14 per- 
cent of the patients had preoperative hemoglobin S lev- 
els that were more than 1 SD above the mean. In about 
40 percent of these patients, the percentage of hemo- 
globin S did not fall substantially, despite adequate ex- 
change transfusions or repeated simple transfusions; 
the other 60 percent had inadequate transfusions be- 
cause of calculation errors by physicians, difﬁculty in 
obtaining matched blood, or complications that pre- 
cluded further transfusion. In group 2, 15 percent of 
the patients had preoperative hemoglobin S levels that 
were less than 1 SD below the mean; 42 percent of 
these patients required several units of packed red cells 
to increase their hemoglobin levels to 10 g per deciliter 
and therefore had signiﬁcant decreases in the percent- 
age of hemoglobin S. Most of the other patients in this 
group received minimal transfusion therapy. The data 
were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat prin- 
ciple, and once the random assignments had been 
made, the patients remained in their designated groups, 
regardless of their preoperative hemoglobin S values. 
However, the relation between hemoglobin S levels and 
complication rates was also analyzed. 
There were no signiﬁcant differences in the periop- 
erative care of the patients in the two groups. Eighty-

of those in group 2 received preoperative hydration. All 
the patients in both groups were monitored intraoper- 
atively. Eighty-two percent of the patients in group 1 
and 83 percent of those in group 2 received a combina- 
tion of inhalation and intravenous anesthesia. The av- 
erage duration of anesthesia was 2.6 hours in group 1 
and 2.5 hours in group 2. Postoperative care was also 
similar in the groups; 93 percent of the patients in 
group 1 and 92 percent of those in group 2 received ox- 
ygen; intravenous hydration was administered to 97 
percent of the patients in group 1 and to 96 percent of 
those in group 2. 
There were no signiﬁcant differences between group 
1 and group 2 with respect to the types of surgery that 
were performed or the surgical-risk scores. Over three 
quarters of the operations were cholecystectomies; ear, 
nose, and throat procedures; or orthopedic procedures 
(Table 2). Within these surgical categories, the two 
groups were matched for age, risk factors, presenting 
symptoms, and subtypes of surgery. 
Nine percent of the procedures in group 1 and 6 per- 
cent of those in group 2 were associated with minor 
complications. The most common minor complication 
was a brief fever. Only serious or life-threatening com- 
plications were analyzed.

cations that occurred after the start of transfusion ther- 
apy. Transfusion-associated complications are reported 
separately. Thirty-one percent of the procedures in 
group 1 and 35 percent of those in group 2 were associ- 
ated with at least one complication. Except for compli- 
cations related to transfusion, there was no signiﬁcant 
difference between the two groups in terms of speciﬁc 
complication rates or overall complication rates accord- 
ing to the surgical-risk category and type of surgery.

riod, after the start of the transfusion regimen. Most of

these complications (87 percent in group 1 and 57 per- 
cent in group 2) consisted of the development of new 
alloantibodies or reactions to transfusion. The other 
preoperative complications were mainly fever or pain- 
ful crises. 
Intraoperative complications occurred in 19 percent 
of the patients. Serious blood loss (more than 10 per- 
cent of the total volume of blood) accounted for over 
half these complications, and the frequency was similar 
in the two groups (12 percent in group 1 and 10 percent 
in group 2). 
Twenty-one percent of the operations in group 1 and 
22 percent of those in group 2 were associated with at 
least one serious or life-threatening postoperative com- 
plication (Table 3); three quarters of the complications 
developed within 14 days after surgery. The frequency 
of the acute chest syndrome, the most common serious 
complication, was the same (10 percent) in the two 
groups. It developed an average of three days after sur- 
gery and lasted for an average of eight days. Thirty- 
seven percent of the patients with this complication 
were treated with transfusions, and 11 percent required 
intubation. Painful crises occurred after 5 percent of 
the operations, and 26 percent of the painful crises 
were associated with the acute chest syndrome. 
There were two deaths in group 1 and none in group 
2. Both deaths occurred in adults with a history of 
pulmonary disease. The ﬁrst patient who died was a 
26-year-old man with a history of the acute chest 
syndrome and splenic sequestration. He underwent an 
elective splenectomy, with a preoperative hemoglobin 
level of 11 g per deciliter and 30 percent hemoglobin S. 
Respiratory distress developed on the second postoper- 
ative day and was eventually followed by multiorgan 
failure. The second patient who died was a 43-year-old 
man with a history of recurrent acute chest syndrome 
and chronic lung disease. He underwent an elective hip 
replacement preceded by transfusions that raised the 
preoperative hemoglobin S level to 26 percent. His in- 
traoperative course was complicated by blood loss re- 
quiring transfusions. Respiratory failure developed on 
the fourth postoperative day and progressed to multior- 
gan failure. 
We attempted to identify predictors of the acute 
chest syndrome, pain, and any other serious or life- 
threatening complication by selecting 15 variables from 
demographic data, medical histories, laboratory results, 
and surgical-risk categories. In a univariate analysis, a 
history of pulmonary disease and a higher surgical-risk 
category were associated with a higher incidence of the 
acute chest syndrome. In a multivariate logistic regres- 
sion that included these two risk factors, age, and 
group assignment, only a higher surgical-risk category 
and a history of pulmonary disease remained signiﬁ- 
cant independent predictors of the acute chest syn- 
drome (Table 4). In a univariate analysis, age and in- 
dicators of clinical severity (organ dysfunction, frequent 
hospitalization, extensive transfusion, and alloimmuni- 
zation) were signiﬁcantly related to the incidence of 
painful crises. In a multivariate logistic analysis, which 
included these variables and the group assignment, 
only older age and a greater number of hospitalizations 
in the year before the surgery remained independent 
signiﬁcant predictors of painful crises (Table 4). In 
univariate logistic analyses, age, previous central nerv- 
ous system disease, frequent hospitalization, extensive 
transfusion, alloimmunization, surgical risk, and the 
preoperative hemoglobin S value were signiﬁcantly re- 
lated to the incidence of any serious or life-threatening 
complication. In the multivariate model, only older age, 
central nervous system disease, prior alloimmuniza- 
tion, and a higher surgical-risk category remained sig- 
niﬁcant independent predictors of a serious or life- 
threatening complication. 
Over 7 percent of all the patients had at least one 
new alloantibody, and 3 percent had multiple alloan- 
tibodies (Table 5). There was a signiﬁcant difference 
between the two groups in the frequency of new allo- 
antibodies (group 1, 10 percent; group 2, 5 percent; 
P(cid:4)0.01). Alloimmunization was associated with the 
number of units transfused (Fig. 1). The four most 
common alloantibodies detected at enrollment were to 
antigens E (in 20 percent of the patients), K (in 13 per- 
cent), C (in 10 percent), and Fya (in 5 percent). These 
were also the four most frequent new alloantibodies: 
antigens E (in 19 percent of the patients), K (in 12 per- 
cent), C (in 14 percent), and Fya (in 5 percent). Hemo- 
lytic transfusion reactions were six times more frequent 
in group 1 (6 percent) than in group 2 (1 percent). 
Autoantibodies developed in 3 percent of the patients, 
most of whom were alloimmunized. 
The average length of hospitalization was the same 
in the two groups (eight days). The average duration 
for a patient with one serious complication was 14 days, 
but the duration varied according to the speciﬁc com- 
plication: acute chest syndrome (11 days), pain (12 
days), infection (19 days), neurologic event (22 days), 
and renal complication (36 days). 
Many patients with sickle cell anemia require surgery 
for complications of the disease.41-48 Despite standard 
perioperative care, they frequently have serious com- 
plications.8,9,25,49 Prophylactic transfusions, which de- 
crease the frequency of most complications in patients 
with sickle cell disease,50 are also frequently given as 
part of perioperative management. In this study we 
compared an aggressive preoperative regimen of trans- 
fusions with a conservative preoperative regimen. We 
found that the conservative approach was as effective 
as the aggressive approach in preventing complications 
and was associated with fewer short-term complica- 
tions of blood transfusion. 
The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease found 
that 7 percent of all deaths among patients with sickle 
cell anemia were related to surgery.49 In this review of 
over 1000 operations the mortality rate was 1.1 per- 
cent.49,51 However, the lack of randomization and the

common practice of using an inten- 
sive transfusion regimen in patients 
viewed as having a high operative 
risk hinder objective comparison of 
transfusion practices. In our random- 
ized, prospective study, 33 percent of 
the patients had complications, and 
the mortality rate was 0.3 percent. 
The acute chest syndrome, the 
most frequent clinical complication, 
developed in 10 percent of the pa- 
tients in our study and was the pri- 
mary factor in the two deaths. In pa- 
tients who do not have sickle cell 
anemia, the frequency of periopera- 
tive pulmonary complications ranges 
from 3 to 70 percent, but most of 
these complications are attributable 
to atelectasis.52-59 We excluded ate- 
lectasis from our analysis of the 
acute chest syndrome. In multiple 
studies of over 100,000 operations, 
the risk of serious pulmonary events 
is less than 1 percent; thus, patients 
with sickle cell anemia are at higher 
risk for serious perioperative pulmo- 
nary complications than the general 
population.36,60 Our ﬁnding that a 
higher surgical-risk category was a 
predictive factor for the acute chest 
syndrome is probably related to 
changes in ventilatory functions after 
major surgery.61 A decrease in oxy- 
genation and ventilation–perfusion 
mismatching may increase the risk of 
pulmonary infarction and infection 
in patients with sickle cell anemia.62 
A history of pulmonary disease was 
also a predictive factor for the acute 
chest syndrome in our study, which is 
consistent with the ﬁnding in the 
general population that a history of 
pulmonary disease or abnormal pul- 
monary function may be associated 
with a sixfold increase in the risk of 
postoperative pulmonary complica- 
tions.63-67 
Painful crises resulting in pro- 
longed hospitalization occurred in 
5 percent of our patients. Older age 
and a greater number of previous 
hospitalizations were predictors of 
such crises, which underlines the im- 
portance of the medical history in 
planning surgery.68-71 
This study demonstrates that the 
frequency of transfusion reactions in 
patients with sickle cell anemia is 
higher than in other patients under-

found to be as effective in preventing 
recurrent stroke as maintaining it at 
30 percent.77,79,85 


We did not include a group of pa- 
tients who received no transfusions in 
this study. The consensus of the in- 
vestigators was that the risk associat- 
ed with no transfusion, estimated on 
the basis of previous data, was too 
high. Studies of elective surgery in 
patients with sickle cell anemia who 
did not receive transfusions suffer 
from the same design ﬂaws and se- 
lection bias reviewed above. In the 
largest series, which included chil- 
dren undergoing elective major sur- 
gery, 35 percent of the patients who 
did not receive transfusions before 
surgery had pulmonary complications, whereas none of 
the patients who received transfusions had such com- 
plications.86 Since prophylactic transfusion therapy re- 
duces the incidence of pulmonary disease and other 
complications of sickle cell anemia, we concluded that 
a pilot prospective trial of surgery without transfusion 
must be conducted before attempting a randomized 
trial.3,80,81,87-90 
In summary, elective surgery in patients with sickle 
cell anemia is generally safe when performed by a mul- 
tidisciplinary team. Despite optimal care, however, 
there is a substantial risk of morbidity, necessitating 
close cooperation among the medical, anesthesia, and 
surgical teams. A conservative transfusion regimen is 
as effective as an aggressive regimen in preventing per- 
ioperative complications, and a conservative approach 
reduces the risk of transfusion-associated complica- 
tions by 50 percent.

going surgery.72 In a group of 530 patients who had car- 
diac surgery and who underwent a transfusion regimen 
that was similar to the regimen we used in group 1, 
red-cell alloantibodies developed in only 2 percent of 
the patients, and no hemolytic transfusion reactions 
were observed.72 In contrast, new red-cell antibodies 
developed in 10 percent of our patients in group 1, and 
hemolytic transfusion reactions occurred in 6 percent. 
Among the patients in group 2, who received half as 
many units of blood as the patients in group 1, the al- 
loimmunization rate was reduced to 5 percent, and the 
rate of hemolytic reactions to 1 percent. The alloanti- 
bodies detected in our patients were from common an- 
tigens, conﬁrming our previous observation73 that the 
high incidence of alloantibodies in patients with sickle 
cell anemia is due in part to differences in the incidence 
of red-cell antigens between black patients and blood 
donors, who are typically white. Therefore, routine use 
of extended, matched transfusions could be made cost 
effective by decreasing the susceptibility to alloimmuni- 
zation.73-75 
The optimal number of transfusions required to 
decrease sickling in patients undergoing surgery is un- 
known. A growing body of evidence suggests that lim- 
ited dilution of sickle cells is beneﬁcial.51,76-80 A hemo- 
globin S level of 30 percent has been recommended, but 
levels as high as 50 to 60 percent could be equally ef- 
fective. Early studies of transfusion therapy demon- 
strated a reversal of organ dysfunction despite relative- 
ly high hemoglobin S levels.80,81 In vitro studies have 
shown that blood ﬂow and viscosity depend on the level 
of hemoglobin and the percentage of hemoglobin 
S.78,82-84 A ﬁxed hematocrit of 30 percent minimizes the 
rise in viscosity associated with higher proportions of 
sickle cells.83 Moreover, interactions between reversibly 
sickled cells may increase the viscosity78; the addition of 
normal cells reduces these interactions, which suggests 
that a relatively small number of units of transfused 
blood can decrease sickling events in vivo. In patients 
with sickle cell anemia and stroke, maintaining the he-
