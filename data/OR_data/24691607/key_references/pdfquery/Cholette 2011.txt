Objective: To examine the impact of a restrictive vs. liberal 
transfusion strategy on arterial lactate and oxygen content dif- 
ferences in children with single-ventricle physiology post cavo- 
pulmonary connection. Children with single-ventricle physiology 
are routinely transfused postoperatively to increase systemic 
oxygen delivery, and transfusion thresholds in this population 
have not been studied. 
Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. 
Setting: Pediatric cardiac intensive care unit in a teaching 



Interventions: Subjects were randomized to a restrictive (he- 
moglobin of <9.0 g/dL), or liberal (hemoglobin of >13.0 g/dL) 
transfusion strategy for 48 hrs post operation. Primary outcome 
measures were mean and peak arterial lactate. Secondary end 
points were arteriovenous (C(a-v)O2) and arteriocerebral oxygen 
content (C(a-c)O2) differences and clinical outcomes. 
Measurements and Main Results: A total of 30 children were in 
each group. There were no signiﬁcant preoperative differences. 
Mean hemoglobin in the restrictive and liberal groups were 11 (cid:2) 
1.3 g/dL and 13.9 (cid:2) 0.5 g/dL, respectively (p < .01). No differ- 
ences in mean (1.4 (cid:2) 0.5 mmol/L [Restrictive] vs. 1.4 (cid:2) 0.4 
mmol/L [Liberal]) or peak (3.1 (cid:2) 1.5 mmol/L [Restrictive] vs. 
3.2 (cid:2) 1.3 mmol/L [Liberal]) lactate between groups were found. 
Mean number of red blood cell transfusions were 0.43 (cid:2) 0.6 and 
2.1 (cid:2) 1.2 (p < .01), and donor exposure was 1.2 (cid:2) 0.7 and 2.4 (cid:2) 
1.1 to (p < .01), for each group, respectively. No differences were 
found in C(a-v)O2, C(a-c)O2, or clinical outcome measures. 
Conclusion: Children with single-ventricle physiology do not 
beneﬁt from a liberal transfusion strategy after cavopulmonary 
connection. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy 
decreases the number of transfusions, donor exposures, and 
potential risks in these children. Larger studies with clinical 
outcome measures are needed to determine the transfusion 
threshold for children post cardiac repair or palliation for 
congenital heart disease. (Pediatr Crit Care Med 2011; 12:

commonly transfused to higher hemoglo- 
bin levels to increase their oxygen- 
carrying capacity, particularly post car- 
diac surgery and during periods of 
cardiorespiratory stress (1–3). 
Children with complex congenital 
heart disease often require palliative in- 
terventions that maintain intracardiac 
mixing lesions and cyanosis. Postopera- 
tively, these children are relatively ane- 
mic and may have poor cardiac function. 
Practitioners typically maintain elevated 
hemoglobin concentrations in these 
children immediately post palliative 
procedures for concern that they can- 
not increase their cardiac output to 
compensate for low systemic oxygen de- 
livery (2, 3). The risk/beneﬁt ratio of this 
practice is unknown, and clinical practice 
varies greatly (4, 5). 
adults (6, 7) and children (8) and the ev- 
idence that a restrictive transfusion strat- 
egy in critically ill adults (9) and chil- 
dren (10) is well tolerated, it is important 
to determine whether children with car- 
diac disease and those undergoing car- 
diac surgery (speciﬁcally for single- 
ventricle physiology) can tolerate relative 
anemia. Subgroup analysis (11) of the 
transfusion requirements in a pediatric 
intensive care (TRIPICU) study that fo- 
cused on children post cardiac surgery 
found no difference in new or progressive 
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (pri- 
mary outcome variable) in the restrictive 
vs. liberal group; however, patients with 
cyanotic heart disease and those having 
palliative interventions (including Bidi- 
rectional Glenn [BDG] and Fontan pro- 
cedures) were excluded. 
Given the cost and risks of blood prod- 
uct administration in critically ill 
We hypothesize that a restrictive strat- 
egy of RBC transfusion is as effective as, 

and possibly superior to, a liberal trans- 
fusion strategy in children with single- 
ventricle physiology undergoing cavopul- 
monary connection. Our primary aim is 
to compare peak and mean arterial lac- 
tate in children post cavopulmonary con- 
nection randomized to a restrictive vs. 
liberal transfusion protocol. Our second- 
ary aims are to compare surrogate mea- 
sures of oxygen delivery, speciﬁcally the 
arteriovenous and arteriocerebral oxygen 
content differences, and clinical out- 
comes between transfusion groups. 

Subjects. Infants and children presenting 
to the University of Rochester Medical Center 
for elective partial or total cavopulmonary 
connection (BDG or Fontan procedures) were 
eligible. Children were excluded only if con- 
sent could not be obtained. The protocol was 
approved by the University of Rochester 
Medical Center Research Subjects Review 
Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov 
(NCT00350220). Interim review was performed 
every 6 months by an independent medical 
safety monitor. 
Subjects were enrolled at their preanesthe- 
sia visit. Properly witnessed and documented 
informed consent was obtained from a parent/ 
guardian. Once enrolled, subjects were divided 
into those having BDG or Fontan procedures, 
and block randomization (block size 8) was 
used to randomize subjects to either the re- 
strictive or liberal transfusion strategy (strati- 
ﬁed randomization). The transfusion strategy 
was initiated on postoperative admission to 
the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit 
(PCICU) and continued until 48 hrs from the 
time of admission after which RBC transfu- 
sions were utilized, according to current best 
practice at University of Rochester Medical 
Center. 
Baseline Assessment. Baseline measures 
were collected at the time of surgery. Preop- 
erative hemoglobin concentration, partial 
pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2), 
arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), venous oxy- 
gen saturation (SvO2), and regional cerebral 
oxygen saturation (rSO2) were collected. Left 
forehead cerebral oximeters, using the INVOS 
system (Somanetics Inc., Troy, MI), were uti- 
lized for rSo2 measurements. These data were 
also collected in the operating room after car- 
diopulmonary bypass (CPB). Surgical details 
and intraoperative use of blood products were 
recorded. 
Surgical Procedures. A single sur- 
geon (G.M.A.) performed all surgeries. Cavo- 
pulmonary connection was achieved with a 
BDG or Fontan procedure. In general, BDG 
was done as part of a staged correction that 
ultimately would lead to Fontan. The BDG 
directed superior vena caval blood ﬂow to the 
conﬂuent pulmonary arteries. The Fontan was 
an extracardiac, total cavopulmonary connec- 

tion utilizing a 16 –20 mm polytetraﬂuoroeth- 
ylene Impra or Gore-Tex conduit (Bard Pe- 
ripheral Vascular Inc., Tempe, AZ; or W. L. 
Gore & Associates Inc., Flagstaff, AZ). The 
extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection 
included a 4 –5 mm fenestration between the 
polytetraﬂuoroethylene graft and the lateral 
wall of the right atrium. CPB was established, 
using single arterial, bicaval cannulation. All 
patients were maintained at normothermia. 
Aortic cross-clamping with global myocardial 
ischemia was rarely necessary. 
The Terumo RX05 oxygenator (Terumo 
Cardiovascular Systems, Ann Arbor, MI) was 
used for subjects weighing (cid:1)10 kg, and the 
Terumo RX15 oxygenator was used for sub- 
jects weighing (cid:1)10 kg. Red blood cells (RBCs) 
were used in the CPB prime for infants wigh- 
ing (cid:2)10 kg. All patients were managed intra- 
operatively on CPB with unfractionated hepa- 
rin adjusted according to activated clotting 
times and reversed with protamine. All pa- 
tients on CPB received epsilon aminocaproic 
acid. 

fresh-frozen 
plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate were given at 
the discretion of the cardiac surgeon and an- 
esthesiologist. Central venous and arterial 
catheters and mediastinal drainage tubes were 
placed in the operating room. Vasoactive 
medications (epinephrine and/or dopamine 
and/or milrinone) were utilized to maintain 
hemodynamics during transition off CPB at 
the discretion of the cardiac surgical team. All 
patients remained intubated and sedated for 
transfer to the PCICU. 
PCICU Procedures. All subjects received 
current PCICU standard of care aside from 
their transfusion strategy. Subjects were 
weaned from mechanical ventilation and ex- 
tubated as their cardiopulmonary status al- 
lowed. Crystalloid and/or 5% albumin were 
infused in 10 –20 mL/kg boluses for clinical 
ﬁndings of hypovolemia and poor cardiac out- 
put (i.e., tachycardia, poor pulses and perfu- 
sion, low urine output and/or hypotension) 
as needed to maintain hemodynamic stabil- 
ity. Vasoactive agents were adjusted to 
maintain hemodynamics and end-organ per- 
fusion. Subjects were transferred to the gen- 
eral 
inpatient units once they no longer 
required intensive care. 
Transfusion Strategy. The cardiac sur- 
geon, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, and oper- 
ating room staff were blinded to study assign- 
ment. Transfusion of blood products in the 
operating room, both on and off CPB, pro- 
ceeded as per standard practice. The study 
protocol was initiated at the time of PCICU 
admission. 
Liberal Transfusion Group. The liberal 
transfusion group required 10 mL/kg of RBCs 
for any hemoglobin of (cid:2)13.0 g/dL regardless 
of whether there was a clinical indication for 
transfusion. 
Restrictive Transfusion Group. The restric- 
tive transfusion group required 10 mL/kg of 
RBCs for any hemoglobin of (cid:2)9.0 g/dL accom- 
panied by clinical ﬁndings suggestive of symp- 
tomatic anemia (i.e., tachycardia and/or hypo- 
tension unresponsive to crystalloid or colloid 
infusion; poor perfusion and/or worsening ox- 
ygenation). 

irradiated 
RBC units were used for all transfusions. 
When possible, RBC units were split to reduce 
donor exposure. RBC transfusions were typi- 
cally given rapidly for (cid:2)3 hrs at the discretion 
of the intensivist. RBC transfusions were be- 
gun within 1 hr of reaching the hemoglobin 
threshold. The transfusion protocol was ap- 
plied for the ﬁrst 48 hrs of PCICU admission. 
The protocol could be suspended at the dis- 
cretion of the cardiac intensivist for hemody- 
namic instability, refractory hypoxemia, active 
bleeding, and/or need for surgical interven- 
tion. Clinical staff and patient families were 
aware of transfusion group assignment; the 
independent data safety monitor was blinded 
to the assignment. 
Transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma, plate- 
lets, and/or cryoprecipitate was performed as 
clinically indicated for both groups. According 
to our practice, all subjects received aspirin 
daily beginning on the ﬁrst postoperative day. 
In addition, subjects having Fontan proce- 
dures were begun on warfarin once patients 
were tolerating oral medications (goal inter- 
national normalized ratio, 2–2.5). 
Ongoing Measurements. Hemoglobin con- 
centration, PaO2, SaO2 SvO2, rSO2, mean arte- 
rial blood pressure, central venous pressure 
proximal to the BDG or Fontan, and blood 
lactate were measured at PCICU admission 
and every 4 hrs for 48 hrs. Arterial, venous, 
and cerebral oxygen content (from rSO2 val- 
ues) was derived from established formulas 
and C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 were calculated. 
Outcome Measures. Mean and peak arterial 
lactate level during the initial 48 hrs were the 
primary outcome measures. Secondary out- 
comes were the C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 and clin- 
ical outcomes (length of mechanical ventila- 
tion, 
length and dose of vasoactive agent 
administration, PCICU and hospital length of 
stay, mediastinal tube drainage, and volume of 
crystalloid and albumin infused during the 
study period). 
Statistical Analysis. Sample size calcula- 
tions were performed before initiating the 
study. We deﬁned the two treatments as equiv- 
alent if the mean and peak lactate during the 
study period did not differ by (cid:1)2 mmol/L. 
Based on our experience, we expected the SD of 
arterial lactate to be 1.5 mmol/L. We set type 
I error rate to 0.05. Based on these assump- 
tions, we determined that 29 subjects would 
be needed per group to have 80% power to 
reject the null hypothesis. 
Primary analysis compared mean and peak 
arterial lactate levels between each treatment 
group. Data from each time point for each 
variable were collated, and the mean, median, 
and SD values were determined. Comparisons 
were made, using analysis of variance and Stu- 
dent’s t tests for normally distributed data. For 

data that were not normally distributed (spe- 
ciﬁcally clinical outcome measures), Mann- 
Whitney tests were performed. A p (cid:2) .05 was 
considered statistically signiﬁcant. The z tests 
of two proportions were calculated to compare 
proportions; a z score (cid:2)(cid:3)2.0 or (cid:1)2.0 was 
considered statistically signiﬁcant. 
All subject data were analyzed at study 
completion in the manner of “intention-to- 
treat” to ensure proper statistical interpreta- 
tion of the study results. The statistical pack- 
age for the social sciences (SPSS) version 
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all 
statistical analyses. 

From August 2006 to September 2009, 
63 children were eligible for study partic- 
ipation. Sixty-two children and families 
agreed to participate and gave informed 
consent. Thirty-one subjects were ran- 
domized to each group. One subject in 
each group was unable to have surgery 
performed and was excluded. One could 
not be endotracheally intubated second- 
ary to Klipple Feil syndrome, and the 
other had bleeding complications before 
going on CPB. Thirty subjects underwent 
surgery and completed study procedures. 
No subjects dropped out of the study, and 
none was lost to follow-up. Adherence to 
data collection for each study variable 
was (cid:2)97% with missed data points due to 
discontinuation of arterial and/or venous 
access. There was 100% compliance with 
study procedures; the protocol was never 
suspended. All transfusions were initiated 
(cid:2)60 mins of meeting transfusion criteria. 
Thirty-three (55%) subjects under- 
went BDG, and 27 (45%) underwent the 
Fontan procedure. Fifty-nine (98.3%) 
cases were performed on CPB. The one 
case performed off CPB was a BDG ran- 
domized to the liberal group. Mean CPB 
time was 75 (cid:4) 35 mins. No subjects re- 
quired reexploration for bleeding. There 
were no signiﬁcant differences in baseline 
characteristics between groups, or admis- 
sion hemoglobin, 
lactate, and oxygen 
saturations (Table 1). 
Arterial Lactate Levels. Mean (restric- 
tive: 1.4 (cid:4) 0.5 mmol/L; liberal: 1.4 (cid:4) 0.4 
mmol/L) and peak (restrictive: 3.1 (cid:4) 1.5 
mmol/L; liberal: 3.2 (cid:4) 1.3 mmol/L) arte- 
rial lactate levels were similar between the 
two treatment groups (Table 2; Fig. 1). 
Oxygen Utilization. C(a-v)O2 (restric- 
tive: 3.86 (cid:4) 1; liberal: 4.15 (cid:4) 0.09; p (cid:5) 
.234) and C(a-c)O2 (restrictive: 2.77 (cid:4) 
1.07; liberal: 2.72 (cid:4) 0.91; p (cid:5) .84) did not 
differ between the study groups. Simi- 
larly, when the largest differences for 
each patient over the 48 hrs were com-

RBC Transfusions/Donor Exposures. 
Mean hemoglobin for the restrictive 




group was signiﬁcantly lower (11.1 (cid:4) 1.3 
g/dL) 
liberal 
group (13.9 (cid:4) 0.5 g/dL) (p (cid:2) .01) (Table 
2). Patients in the restrictive group re- 
ceived fewer transfusions (0.43 (cid:4) 0.6 vs. 
2.1 (cid:4) 1.2; p (cid:2) .001). Nineteen (63.3%) of 
30 restrictive subjects did not require any 
RBC transfusions; only one (3%) in the 
liberal group did not receive any RBC 
transfusion (z (cid:5) 4.656; p (cid:2) .01). Five 
restrictive group subjects received an 
RBC transfusion after the 48-hr study pe- 

riod and before hospital discharge, com- 
pared with three liberal group subjects. 
There was no substantial difference in the 
results when these ﬁve subjects were re- 
moved from analysis. 
Twenty-nine (96.6%) restrictive sub- 
jects at one time point had a measured 
hemoglobin of (cid:2)13.0 g/dL and would 
have received at least one additional RBC 
transfusion had they been assigned to the 
liberal group. The mean number of donor 
exposures (including RBCs given in the 
OR) was different between groups (restric- 
tive: 1.2 (cid:4) 0.7; liberal: 2.4 (cid:4) 1.1, p (cid:2) .01). 
Clinical Outcomes. Although not pow- 
ered to test for statistical differences, 
mortality, PCICU and hospital length of 
stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, 
dose and duration of inotropic support, 
total colloid infusion, coagulant product 
infusions, and total mediastinal tube 
drainage were similar between subject 
groups. There was a trend toward in- 
creased crystalloid infusion in the restric- 
tive group (27.1 mL/kg vs. 14.6 mL/kg; 
p (cid:5) .07) (Table 2). One subject in the 
liberal transfusion strategy died on post- 
operative day 39 from staphlycoccal sep- 
sis. No restrictive strategy subjects died. 
Subgroup Analysis of BDG and Fon- 
tan Subjects. Although not powered to 
test for statistical differences, subgroup 
analysis of BDG and Fontan subjects re- 
vealed similar results (Table 4). Peak and 
mean arterial lactate and mean C(a-c)O2 
did not differ between study groups for 
subjects speciﬁcally receiving BDG or 
Fontan procedures. In BDG subjects, 
mean C(a-v)O2 was signiﬁcantly lower in 
the restrictive group (restrictive: 3.6 (cid:4) 
0.5; liberal: 4.2 (cid:4) 0.9; p (cid:5) .04). These 
results were not duplicated in Fontan 
subjects (restrictive: 4.2 (cid:4) 1.3; 
liberal: 
4.1 (cid:4) 0.9; p (cid:5) .89). 

Despite their uniquely compromised 
physiology, children with single-ventricle 
physiology and lower hemoglobin con- 
centrations were able to maintain ade- 
quate tissue oxygen delivery post cavo- 
pulmonary connection and did not seem 
to beneﬁt from a liberal transfusion strat- 
egy. Mean and peak arterial lactate levels 
were similar in children managed with a 
restrictive and liberal transfusion strat- 
egy. The adverse effects of RBC transfu- 
sions are well described (12–14), and 
those subjects maintained at higher he- 
moglobin concentrations 
received 
greater numbers of RBC transfusions, do-

nor exposures, and risk of RBC transfu- 
sions without apparent clinical beneﬁt. 
Peak and mean arterial lactate were 
selected as primary outcome measures as 
use of a primary clinical outcome mea- 
sure (such as illness severity scores) 
would be less sensitive to subtle changes 
and require subject numbers that would 
necessitate multicentered participation. 
Lactate was chosen as it is an easily avail- 
able, objective, and reliable marker of ill- 
ness severity, indicating circulatory com- 
promise and inadequate oxygen delivery 
and/or utilization (15–18). Serial lactate 
levels have been found to correlate with 
morbidity and mortality post pediatric 
cardiac surgery (19 –24). The mean arte- 
rial lactate level over 48 hrs represented a 
rough summation of hemodynamics dur- 
ing the period, whereas the peak level 
represented the worst hemodynamics of 
the period. Venous and regional oxygen 
saturations were collected to serve as sur- 
rogate measures of oxygen delivery and to 
generate C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 differ- 
ences as indices of cardiac output and 
cerebral blood ﬂow. 
Measures of SvO2 and rSO2 were lower 
in the restrictive group, and although 
statistically signiﬁcant, 
it is unclear 
whether these differences are clinically 
important. Additional studies with larger 
subject numbers and long-term follow-up 
data that explore for an association be- 
tween hemoglobin, venous and cerebral 
oxygen saturations, and neurodevelop- 
mental outcomes are warranted. In the 
restrictive group, CaO2, CvO2, and CcO2 
were lower as a consequence of lower 
hemoglobin concentrations, but signiﬁ- 
cant increases in C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 
were not found. When combined with 
stable blood lactate levels, this suggests 
that children in the restrictive group 
were not disadvantaged by their lower 
CaO2, and were able to maintain adequate 
tissue oxygen delivery and utilization. 
This study did not speciﬁcally examine 
the effect of hemoglobin on systemic and 
pulmonary vascular resistance. Data re- 
garding heart rate, urine output, capillary 
reﬁll, and perfusion would provide addi- 
tional information regarding the hemo- 
dynamics of each subject. As this popula- 
tion is dependent on low pulmonary 
vascular resistance for pulmonary blood 
ﬂow, the effect of the hemoglobin level 
on pulmonary vascular resistance would 
be interesting to compare. It is unlikely 
that the liberal group had a clinically 
relevant elevation in their pulmonary 
vascular resistance from higher hemoglo- 
bin levels, as they did not demonstrate 
signiﬁcantly lower SaO2 or PaO2 levels. 
There was a numeric but not statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant increase in length of me- 
chanical ventilation, duration and degree 
of inotropic support, and length of stay in 
the restrictive group. As this study was 
not powered to assess for clinical out- 
come differences, it is possible that, with 
larger subject numbers, these differences 
would become signiﬁcant. The restrictive 
group did receive larger volumes of crys- 
talloid infusion compared with the liberal 
group, which potentially contributed to 
increased pulmonary edema and duration 
of mechanical ventilation. 
This is the only randomized controlled 
trial to examine the postoperative trans- 
fusion threshold in children with single- 
ventricle physiology undergoing surgical 
palliation. There was no selection bias as 
all subjects presenting for cavopulmo- 
nary connection were considered eligible, 
and 98% of eligible subjects were in- 
cluded. As the exclusion criteria con- 
sisted only of inability to obtain consent, 
no complicating or preexisting clinical 
condition prevented study participation. 
As the research protocol was initiated im- 
mediately at the time of admission to the 
PCICU, there was no requirement for pa- 
tient “stabilization”; therefore, the most 
severely ill or compromised subjects were 
included. Study ﬁndings are further sup- 


ported by the fact that there were no 
protocol violations, there was 100% ad- 
herence to the transfusion strategy, and 
no subjects were lost to follow-up. 
Strengths of the study design include 
the focus on the immediate postoperative 
period where the potential for low cardiac 
output syndrome and bleeding complica- 
tions is the highest, and when RBC trans- 
fusions are most likely to be adminis- 
tered. The one other study to examine 
transfusion thresholds post pediatric car- 
diac surgery (the TRIPICU subgroup 
analysis) included subjects within 7 days 
after pediatric intensive care unit admis- 
sion (presumably up to 7 days post oper- 
ation), possibly outside the period of 
greatest risk for hemodynamic compro- 
mise, bleeding, and need for RBC trans- 
fusion (20). An additional strength of this 
study is the frequency at which data were 
obtained. Hemoglobin concentration was 
measured every 4 hrs, and all transfu- 
sions were initiated within an hour of 
reaching the transfusion threshold, thus 
ensuring that liberal group subjects were 
maintained consistently over the hemo- 
globin threshold of 13 g/dL. 
The major limitation of this study is 
that the difference in mean hemoglobin 
between the two treatment groups was 
not larger. Subjects were admitted to the 
PCICU with a mean hemoglobin of 12 
g/dL, and in the absence of signiﬁcant 
bleeding, many restrictive group subjects 
maintained their hemoglobin well (cid:1)9 
g/dL, decreasing the between-group dif- 
ference. However, the aim of this study 
was to test a transfusion strategy, not an 
intervention, as demonstrated by the fact 
that several subjects in each group did 
not receive any RBCs because they did 
not meet the threshold for transfusion. 
When this study was designed, the re- 
search subject review board would not 
permit decreasing the transfusion thresh- 
old limit further for the restrictive group, 
but in light of these results, future stud- 
ies with a lower hemoglobin threshold 
should be performed. 
Although results more distant from 
surgery would add valuable data, the 
48-hr postoperative study period was se- 
lected as this is when patients are at 
greatest risk for low cardiac output states 
and when RBCs are most commonly 
transfused. Obtaining study measures 
further out would require prolonging in- 
dwelling catheters for access (limiting 
patient mobility and increasing risk of 
catheter-related thrombosis) or using 
needle-sticks, and the additional blood 

sampling might lead to larger phlebot- 
omy losses that would affect hemoglobin 
values. Furthermore, postoperatively pa- 
tients typically raise their hemoglobin 
concentration over several weeks to 
months, especially in the presence of cy- 
anosis. Therefore, hemoglobin differ- 
ences between groups would lessen over 
time until the two groups would not be 
signiﬁcantly different and, thus, not allow 
for between-group comparison. 
This study would have been stronger 
had it been powered to assess BDG and 
Fontan subjects separately, as signiﬁcant 
differences in postoperative physiology 
exist for each procedure. Children with 
variations of single-ventricle physiology 
were chosen as they are cyanotic on pre- 
sentation and have the unique limitation 
in their ability to increase their cardiac 
output and oxygen delivery. Because sub- 
ject numbers are limited, all patients 
with single-ventricle physiology undergo- 
ing cavopulmonary connection were in- 
cluded. Future studies with larger subject 
numbers would allow each group to be 
analyzed separately. This study would be 
of greater interest if it included neonates 
with single-ventricle physiology undergo- 
ing initial palliation, as these subjects 
have a greater degree of cyanosis and 
pulmonary vascular reactivity. In light of 
our results,we are initiating a prospective 
randomized trial comparing transfusion 
thresholds in neonates with single- 
ventricle physiology undergoing ﬁrst 
stage surgical palliation. 
Had study measures been followed 
longer or more subjects studied, addi- 
tional clinical outcomes measures (e.g., 
sepsis, mediastinitis, thrombosis) would 
have been interesting to compare. Test- 
ing of cognitive and behavioral develop- 
ment and function at distant time points 
could provide documentation of longer- 
term neurodevelopmental outcomes and 
might add important information. Future 
studies, including markers of inﬂamma- 
tion, could add valuable information re- 
garding each subject’s degree of inﬂam- 
mation and immunomodulation in 
response to blood transfusions. 

It seems that a lower hemoglobin level 
can be maintained in children with sin- 
gle-ventricle physiology post cavopulmo- 
nary connection without effecting arte- 
rial lactate levels, measurable end points 
of tissue oxygenation, and/or clinical out- 
comes. These results strongly suggest 
that the practice of aggressively main- 
taining high hemoglobin concentrations 
postoperatively in children with single- 
ventricle physiology post cavopulmonary 
connection be reexamined. Achieving 
this unproven therapeutic goal comes at 
the cost of increased transfusions without 
proven beneﬁts. Larger studies utilizing 
clinical outcome measures might reﬂect 
improved outcomes in subjects managed 
with a restrictive RBC transfusion strat- 
egy. These results might be extrapolated 
to neonates and other children with com- 
plex congenital heart disease who un- 
dergo palliative procedures. Further work 
is necessary to explore whether our re- 
sults can be generalized to these popula- 
tions.
