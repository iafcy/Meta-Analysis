ambulation after hip fracture surgery

BACKGROUND: Perioperative anemia leads to 
increased morbidity and mortality and potentially inhibits 
rehabilitation after hip fracture surgery. As such, the 
optimum transfusion threshold after hip fracture surgery 
is unknown. 
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 elderly, cog- 
nitively intact hip fracture patients admitted from their 
own home were randomly assigned to receive transfu- 
sion at a hemoglobin threshold of 10.0 g per dL (liberal) 
versus 8.0 g per dL (restrictive) in the entire periopera- 
tive period. Patients were treated according to a well- 
deﬁned multimodal rehabilitation program. Primary 
outcome was postoperative functional mobility mea- 
sured with the cumulated ambulation score (CAS). 
RESULTS: Patients in the liberal group received trans- 
fusions more frequently than those in the restrictive 
group (44 patients vs. 22 patients; p < 0.01) and 
received more transfusions during hospitalization 
(median, 2 units [interquartile range, 1-2] vs. 1 [1-2]; 
p < 0.0001). There were no signiﬁcant differences in 
postoperative rehabilitation scores (CAS: median, 9 
[9-15] vs. 9 [9-13.5]; p = 0.46) or in length of stay 
(median, 18 days vs. 16 days, respectively; p = 0.46). 
There were fewer patients in the liberal transfusion 
group with cardiovascular complications (2% vs. 10%; 
p = 0.05) and a lower mortality (0% vs. 8%; p = 0.02). 
CONCLUSION: Although a liberal transfusion trigger 
did not result in increased ambulation scores, restrictive 
transfusion thresholds should be treated with caution in 
elderly high-risk hip fracture patients, until their safety 
has been proved in larger randomized studies. 

which in the elderly patient is associated 
operative blood loss leading to anemia, 
with increased postoperative morbidity and 
mortality.1-4 In addition, postoperative anemia leads to 
increased cardiac demand and tissue hypoxia,5 and hemo- 
globin (Hb) levels below 8.0 g per dL have been associated 
with increased postoperative mortality.6 However, moder- 
ate anemia in hip fracture patients with Hb levels between 
8.0 and 10.0 g per L has not been demonstrated to increase 
mortality in hip fracture patients, but has been associated 
with decreased postoperative ambulation.7-10 
Anemia has been shown to decrease functional 
outcome and increase morbidity and mortality, but the 
correction of moderate anemia with red blood cell (RBC) 
transfusions has not been shown to improve either reha- 
bilitation or morbidity outcomes.11 As such, the optimal 
transfusion threshold in elderly hip fracture patients is 
controversial.

We therefore conducted a randomized study of 
elderly cognitively intact hip fracture patients admitted 
from their own home and treated with a well-deﬁned 
multimodal rehabilitation program to either a liberal or a 
restrictive transfusion threshold to assess the impact on 
postoperative ambulation, morbidity, and mortality. 


Hip fracture patients admitted to the hip fracture unit at 
the department of orthopedics at Hvidovre University 
Hospital were screened for inclusion between February 
2004 and July 2006. Inclusion criteria were primary hip 
fracture occurring in the community in patients older 
than 65 years of age with an independent prefracture 
walking function, community dwelling, and intact cogni- 
tive status. Patients with multiple fractures, prefracture 
terminal condition, alcoholism, chronic transfusion 
needs, acute cardiac or other acute severe medical condi- 
tions, or contraindication to epidural analgesia were 
excluded. Furthermore, patients were excluded from the 
per-protocol analysis of rehabilitation if they were not 
able to participate in the physical therapy program due to 
mobilization restriction by the operating surgeon, transfer 
to another ward for medical complications, or reoperation 
within the ﬁrst 4 days. 
The study is part of Hvidovre University Hospitals Hip 
Fracture Project. The study protocol was approved by the 
local ethics committee and by the Danish data protection 
agency and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with 
the identiﬁer NCT00162617. The study was conducted 
according to the CONSORT guidelines and the Helsinki 
declaration was adhered to. 
Preliminary data indicated that 41 patients were 
needed in each group to demonstrate a 25 percent abso- 
lute reduction in the cumulated ambulation score (CAS) 
with a level of signiﬁcance of 0.05 and a power of 0.80.12 
Since the preliminary data showed that only 69 percent of 
patients required transfusion with a liberal transfusion 
regimen, it was decided to include 60 patients in each 
group. 
A total of 120 included patients were randomly 
assigned into two groups of 60. In the liberal transfusion 
threshold group the patients received transfusion when 
their Hb level decreased to below 10.0 g per dL, whereas 
patients in the restrictive threshold group received 
transfusion when their Hb level decreased to below 8.0 g 
per dL. The randomization was done via a computer- 
generated list by a person not afﬁliated with the project. 
Upon inclusion the sealed envelope, containing the trans- 
fusion threshold and with the patient’s study number on 
it, was placed in the patient charts next to the transfusion 
papers concealing the allocation to both the patient and 

the physiotherapists conducting the ambulation assess- 
ments, making the study double-blind. 

The department’s standardized multimodal rehabilitation 
program was instituted in all patients. The rehabilitation 
program included surgery within 24 hours, epidural anes- 
thesia, and epidural analgesia initiated immediately after 
admittance and continued for 96 hours postoperatively.13 
All patients received oxygen therapy 2 L per minute when- 
ever supine until the fourth postoperative day and were 
given antibiotics as 1.5 g of cefuroxim preoperatively and 
antithrombotic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight 
heparin (40 mg enoxaparin subcutaneously once daily) 
from the time of admission. Patients were on a regular diet 
supplemented by three daily protein drinks. Patients’ 
regular medications were continued throughout the entire 
stay except for warfarin, which was discontinued in the 
immediate perioperative period. 

Preoperative ﬂuid therapy consisted of 20 mL per kg 
rehydration ﬂuid (40 mmol/L Na, 
intravenous 
20 mmol/L K, 250 mmol/L glucose) immediately upon 
admission but after blood sampling; an intraoperative 
infusion of 5 mL per kg per hour isotonic saline was pro- 
vided, supplemented by 6 percent hydroxyethyl starch 
(HES) 130/0.4 (Voluven, Fresenius KABI, Albertslund, 
Denmark) on signs of hypovolemia. Intraoperative blood 
loss was replaced by 6 percent HES 130/0.4, at a rate of 1:1. 
In the postanesthesia care unit all patients received 
500 mL IV glucose (278 mmol/L). Postoperative ﬂuid 
therapy was standardized and IV ﬂuids were only admin- 
istered if daily oral intake was less than 1500 mL or in the 
case of hypovolemia when 500 mL of 6 percent HES 
130/0.4 was given. 

Hb was as a standard measured immediately upon admis- 
sion via venous sampling and analyzed with cyanomethe- 
moglobin method (Advia, Bayer, Lyngby, Denmark), again 
in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and every morning 
until the ﬁfth postoperative day via venous sampling 
with an Hb analyzer (Hemocue, Hemocue Corp., Vedbæk, 
Denmark). 
An intraoperative Hb was only measured and trans- 
fusions given when excessive blood loss was observed. In 
the PACU, any transfusions ordered as a consequence of 
anemia were initiated before the patients left the PACU. In 
the ward, the Hb values were measured in the morning 
and any indication for transfusion was to be acted upon 
immediately. 
If a Hb level less than 10.0 g per dL was measured in a 
patient, the attending physician opened the sealed enve- 
lope to reveal the transfusion group to which the patient 


belonged. The transfusion group was not disclosed to 
either the patient or the attending physiotherapists, and 
as such the study was double-blind. 
Guidelines for transfusions were set according to ran- 
domization as outlined in Fig. 1. If a patient developed an 
acute cardiac condition he or she was transfused as in the 
liberal group regardless of randomization; if patients were 
transferred to other wards due to medical or surgical com- 
plications, they were here transfused at the discretion of 
the attending physicians. Leukoreduced RBC transfusions 
were not given. Transfusion indications were handled by 
the dedicated trauma surgeons attending the wards and 
supervised by MK. 

If possible the patients were mobilized on the day of 
surgery. A physiotherapy program comprising two daily 
30-minute sessions was initiated on the ﬁrst postoperative 
day. Discharge criteria from the hip fracture unit were 
standardized: the ability to independently get in and out 
of bed and to and from a place of eating, the ability to 
independently perform bathroom visits, and the ability to 
walk with the walking aid to be used in the home. Patients 
were primarily rehabilitated in the orthopedic ward. 
Patients, who after initial rehabilitation in the hip fracture 
unit, still required an excessive length of intensive reha- 
bilitation, were only then transferred to a secondary reha- 
bilitation facility. 

Medical conditions, American Society of Anesthesiolo- 
gists (ASA) classiﬁcation, type of surgery, and residential 
status were recorded. Mental status was assessed by a vali- 
dated 9-point Danish version of the abbreviated mental 
status test taken upon admission.14 Functional level pre- 
fracture were assessed with the new mobility score.15 
During the physiotherapy session the patients were 
evaluated on their ambulatory capacity via the CAS,15 
which allows day to day measurements of functional 
mobility in hip fracture patients in the early postoperative 
phase. The CAS describes the patients’ independence in 
ambulation in transfer from supine-to-sitting-to-supine 
and sitting-to-standing-to-sitting and the patient’s 
walking ability with an appropriate aid. 
Each function is assessed on a 3-point 
scale; 2 = independent of human assi- 
stance; 1 = patient 
requiring human 
assistance to perform function; and 
0 = patient unable to perform function 
despite human assistance. The scores of 
each function are cumulated to provide 
a daily score between 0 and 6, with 6 
indicating independent ambulation on 
that particular day. When cumulating the scores from the 
ﬁrst 3 postoperative days, they combine to give a value 
(CAS) from 0 to 18, which has been validated and found to 
be predictive of postoperative rehabilitation outcome.16 
During physiotherapy the patients were also evalu- 
ated for symptoms of anemia by the physiotherapists. The 
symptoms were evaluated by 5-point verbal rating scores 
for both dizziness on standing and feeling of general 
fatigue separately: 0 = none; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; 
3 = severe; and 4 = very severe, prohibiting patient from 
rising from bed. 
Complication was registered in all patients by inten- 
tion to treat. Length of stay and 30-day mortality were 
registered, the latter established via the Danish civil 
registry. 
Primary outcome was the CAS as registered on the 
ﬁrst 3 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes were 
length of stay, cardiac complications (deﬁned as acute 
myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema/acute conges- 
tion, or new onset arrhythmia), infectious complications 
(pneumonia, sepsis, or wound infections), and mortality. 

The CASs were analyzed per-protocol since these data 
were not obtainable in excluded patients, length of stay 
was analyzed both per-protocol and by intention-to-treat, 
and all other data were analyzed by intention-to-treat. 
Tests for signiﬁcant differences between groups were 
done with the chi-square test for categorical data, t tests 
were used for parametric data, and the U test was used for 
nonparametric numeric data. For the analysis of differ- 
ences between types of surgery one-way analysis of vari- 
ance and Kruskall-Wallis test were used. The level of 
signiﬁcance was set at 0.05 or less. All data analysis was 
conducted with computer software (SPSS for Windows 
Version 10.1, SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). 

Inclusion of patients is shown in Fig. 2. A total of 120 
patients were available for intention-to-treat analysis and 
107 patients for the per-protocol analysis. Demographic 
data are shown in Table 1. The randomization did not 
succeed in making two completely comparable groups; 


8.8 g/dl < Hb < 10 g/dl: 
1 unit of RBC 
7.2 g/dl < Hb ≤ 8.8 g/dl: 2 units of RBC 
3 units of RBC 
Hb < 7.2 g/dl: 


7.2 g/dl < Hb < 8 g/dl: 
1 unit of RBC 
5.6 g/dl < Hb ≤ 7.2 g/dl: 2 units of RBC 
3 units of RBC 
Hb < 5.6 g/dl: 



signiﬁcant differences between the two 
groups apart 
reported 
fatigue values in the restrictive transfu- 
sion group on the second postoperative 
day (p = 0.04). There were signiﬁcant 
intergroup differences in the CAS be- 
tween the different types of surgery 
(p = 0.02), with screws/pins and arthro- 
plasty having the highest numbers (i.e., 
best rehabilitation scores); to elucidate 
these differences 
the per-protocol 
analysis were performed on each type of 
surgery separately (Table 3). There was a 
trend toward improved CAS in patients 
with arthroplasty in the liberal transfu- 
sion group, although this was not sig- 
niﬁcant (p = 0.07). 


there were a higher number of patients in the restrictive 
group with an ASA rating of 3 than in the liberal group 
(p = 0.02). This was, however, not reﬂected in a higher 
number of patients with cardiovascular disease (p = 0.19). 
The overall distribution of types of surgery was not differ- 
ent between the two groups (p = 0.18) but there were 
fewer patients (p = 0.05) with pins/screws (Hansson 
Hookpins/Olmed screws) in the liberal transfusion group. 
In the per-protocol analysis there was a signiﬁcantly 
higher number of patients (p = 0.02) in the liberal group 
who had either a sliding hip screw (SHS) or an inter- 
medullary hip screw (IMHS) procedure—predictive of 
higher perioperative blood loss.1 
More patients received transfusions in the liberal 
transfusion group (44 [74%]) than in the restrictive group 
(22 [37%]); the difference was signiﬁcant (<0.01). Patients 
in the liberal transfusion group received signiﬁcantly 
more transfusions (p < 0.0001) than those in the restrictive 
group (median, 2 [interquartile range, 1-2] units vs. 1 [1-2] 
units). Perioperative Hb values are shown in Fig. 3. 
The per-protocol analysis of rehabilitation outcomes 
and anemia symptoms is shown in Table 2. There were no 

Outcomes are shown in Table 4. 
There were no differences in rehabilita- 
tion outcome on an intention-to-treat 
basis. There was a higher rate of cardio- 
vascular complications in the restrictive 
transfusion group (2% vs. 10%; p = 0.05) 
and a higher 30-day mortality (0% vs. 
8%; p = 0.02; relative risk, 2.1 [1.5-2.5]); 
there was no signiﬁcant difference 
between infectious complications in the 
two groups, although there was a trend 
toward a higher incidence of wound 
infections (p = 0.08) in the liberal group. 
Of the ﬁve patients who died in the 
restrictive group none had any known 
disease; 
prefracture 
three had cardiovascular conditions as primary cause of 
death, one died suddenly during the night, and one died of 
general exhaustion (age 98). 


In this randomized trial we did not ﬁnd a decreased reha- 
bilitation potential in patients treated with a restrictive 
transfusion therapy, in the form of decreased postopera- 
tive ambulation, length of stay in hospital, or number of 
patients achieving independent ambulation. We did, 
however, ﬁnd an increased morbidity in the form of car- 
diovascular events and an increased mortality in the 
restrictive transfusion group. 
We previously found postoperative anemia after hip 
fracture surgery to be an independent predictor of post- 
operative inability to walk independently and postopera- 
tive Hb level was also positively correlated with the 
ambulation score.10 Hb level has been found to be an inde- 
pendent predictor for distance walked at discharge, and 
anemia on discharge has been found to be predictive of 
readmission.8-9,17 The only previous randomized study of

* Ambulation score is a composite score evaluating independence in walking or getting 
up from chair. Fatigue and dizziness scores are verbal rating scale 0-4. Cumulated 
scores are the cumulated values from Days 1-3. Values given are median (25-75 per- 
centiles) for ordinal scales, mean (SD) for continuous numeric data, and number (%) 
for categorical data. 



transfusion thresholds after hip fracture 
surgery found no difference in the 
ability to walk independently at dis- 
charge.11 The major advantage of this 
study is that perioperative setup was 
standardized. Patients received a multi- 
modal rehabilitation program,3 includ- 
ing regional anesthesia and analgesia, 
standardized ﬂuid therapy, nutrition 
support, 
supplemental oxygen, and 
intensive physical therapy as well as 
day to day nurse care plans.18 Similar 
programs have been shown to improve 
physical capacity in other types of sur- 
gery compared to conventional care.18 
Pain is associated with poor ambulation 
and 
and 
regional analgesia has been shown to 
reduce pain as a limiting factor in 
rehabilitation.13,19,20 As such, our setup 
should optimize conditions to deﬁne 
and isolate the inﬂuence of transfusion 
thresholds on rehabilitation. Unfortu- 
nately our randomization resulted in a 
signiﬁcant higher proportion of patients 
with either SHS or IMHS in the liberal 
transfusion group. These types of 
surgery that are used in pertrochanteric 
and subtrochanteric fractures have 
been shown to be independent predic- 
tors of increased perioperative blood 
loss; they are associated with higher 
pain levels, a decreased ability to inde- 
pendent ambulation, poorer rehabi- 
litation 
increased 
mortality.1,16,20-23 In the restrictive group, 
there also were a signiﬁcantly higher 
number of patients receiving screws/ 
pins—the procedure associated with 
the least blood loss.1 This could explain 
the fact that despite a higher number of 
transfusions in the liberal group, mean 
Hb values were actually very close in 
the perioperative period, confounding 
the impact of the liberal transfusion 
therapy. A continued blood loss into the 
postoperative period was evident, as 
patients in the liberal transfusion group 
continued to become anemic despite 
transfusions, as documented in previ- 
ous studies.1 


Moderate anemia has been asso- 
ciated with increased mortality in 
patients over 65 years old undergoing 
noncardiac surgery, but no effect of RBC 

to the fact that mortality was a second- 
ary outcome measure, which the study 
was not initially powered to detect. 
Existing cardiovascular disease has 
been shown to increase the risk of perio- 
perative anemia.3 Regional analgesia 
with epidural local anesthetics reduces 
preoperative cardiac complications and 
minimizes postoperative ischemia, and 
as such, our perioperative setup should 
theoretically decrease the risk of cardiac 
complications.13,24,25 We found a signiﬁ- 
cantly higher rate of cardiac complica- 
tions in the restrictive threshold group 
compared to the liberal group, despite 
no signiﬁcant difference in existing 
fatalities 
cardiovascular disease. All 
occurred in patients without known 
cardiac disease. Age is a proxy for 
comorbidity, and elderly patients have 
reduced organ reserves compared to 
younger. Since it is not known to which 
extent cardiovascular disease is under- 
diagnosed in this group of patients, the 
decision to transfuse should probably 
reﬂect this.26 It is also of importance to 
note that the hip fracture population 
included in a study such as this repre- 
sents the ﬁttest part of the population 
and that any negative effects seen will 
potentially be ampliﬁed if implemented 
in the general hip fracture population 
where the degree of medical comorbid- 
ity is even higher. As such, restrictive 
transfusion triggers in elderly hip frac- 
ture patients without known cardiac 
comorbidity should be used cautiously 
until further evidence exists.

transfusion on mortality has been found in hip fracture 
patients with a Hb level of more than 80 g per L.4,17 The 
previous randomized study of transfusion thresholds in 
hip fracture patients compared a threshold of a Hb level of 
less than 100 g per L with a threshold of less than 80 g per 
L or “symptomatic anemia,” and showed a similar trend 
toward improved survival with the liberal transfusion 
trigger—a relative risk of 2.5, compared to 2.1 in the 
present study.11 Despite a signiﬁcantly higher mortality in 
the restrictive transfusion group, the ﬁndings should be 
interpreted with caution both due to the fact that the 
skewed distribution of patients with an ASA score of 3 
between groups may have confounded the result and due 

Transfusions can be immunosup- 
pressive and have been linked to 
increased risk of bacterial infections in 
hip fracture patients, although this is 
controversial.27-29 We did ﬁnd a tendency toward an 
increased incidence of wound infections in the liberal 
group, but no difference in overall incidence of infectious 
complications was found; this outcome is most likely not 
inﬂuenced by the distribution of surgical procedures 
between the groups.30 
The present data do not allow us to conclude ﬁnally 
on the safety of restrictive transfusion thresholds in the 
elderly hip fracture patient with or without cardiac comor- 
bidity thereby calling for larger well-designed randomized 
studies with mortality as a primary outcome measure. 
Such studies should stratify patients according to type of 
surgery to avoid the confounding effects of pain and

of transfusion thresholds on rehabilitation. Until such 
data are available, the clinical application of restrictive 
transfusion thresholds should be applied cautiously in hip 
fracture patients.
