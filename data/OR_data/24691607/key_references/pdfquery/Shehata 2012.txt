BACKGROUND: It is important to determine the 
optimal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration for red blood 
cell (RBC) transfusion for patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery because increased mortality has been associ- 
ated with the severity of anemia and exposure to RBCs. 
Because a deﬁnitive trial will require thousands of 
patients, and because there is variability in transfusion 
practices, a pilot study was undertaken to determine 
adherence to proposed strategies. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center par- 
allel randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted in 
high-risk cardiac patients to assess adherence to two 
transfusion strategies. Fifty patients were randomly 
assigned either to a “restrictive” transfusion strategy 
(RBCs if their Hb concentration was 70 g/L or less intra- 
operatively during cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] and 
75 g/L or less postoperatively) or a “liberal” transfusion 
strategy (RBCs if their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or 
less during CPB and less than 100 g/L postoperatively). 
RESULTS: The percentage of adherence overall was 
84% in the restrictive arm and 41% in the liberal arm. 
Twenty-two (88%) patients were transfused 99 units of 
RBCs in the liberal group compared to 13 patients 
who were transfused 50 units in the restrictive group 
(p < 0.01). There were no signiﬁcant differences in indi- 
vidual adverse outcomes; however, more adverse 
events occurred in the restrictive group (38 vs. 15, 
p < 0.01). 
CONCLUSION: Adherence to the evaluated interven- 
tions is vital to all randomized controlled trials as it has 
the potential to affect outcomes. Further pilot studies 
are required to optimize enrollment and transfusion 
adherence before a deﬁnitive study is conducted. 

cardiac surgery, in part due to the question of 
whether these patients require a higher transfu- 
sion threshold. However, there is little direct evi- 
dence to support this assumption. To date no randomized 
controlled trial has assessed the optimal transfusion 
threshold or determined the crossover point at which the 
risk of acute anemia exceeds that of RBC transfusion in 
cardiac surgical patients. 
In a retrospective study of seven Canadian centers, 
which included 11,812 cardiac surgical patients,1 44% of 
patients received one or more RBC units, and the range of 
patients transfused was 28% to 60%. In a recent study in

the United States, in 100, 000 patients undergoing primary 
elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) the 
frequency of RBC transfusion rates ranged from 7.8% to 
92.8%.2 Because morbidity and mortality may be depen- 
dent on the severity of anemia and exposure to 
transfusions,3-8 it is essential to determine the optimal 
threshold hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at which phy- 
sicians should be transfusing these patients, to reduce 
morbidity and mortality. This is particularly important 
because the efﬁcacy of liberal transfusion has not been 
established in cardiac surgical patients and RBC transfu- 
sion has been associated with an increased risk of renal 
failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 
1.9-2.3), cardiac complications (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.6), 
neurologic events (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.4), and mortality 
(OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-1.9).8 
Despite the large number of published clinical studies 
which have attempted to determine the optimal Hb con- 
centration at which to transfuse cardiac surgical patients, 
no clear consensus has emerged to guide clinical practice. 
Retrospective analyses have demonstrated increased 
morbidity and mortality near preoperative Hb values less 
than 120 g/L5,9 and at intraoperative Hb values ranging 
from 50 to 80 g/L.10,11 Furthermore, patients having car- 
diovascular surgery with postoperative hematocrit (Hct) 
values of 34% (Hb concentrations of 110 g/L) or higher 
appeared to have an increase in morbidity.12 The OR for 
myocardial infarction for the group with a Hct of 34% or 
higher was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.04-4.76) compared to the group 
with a Hct of 24% or less.12 Yet, low Hb concentrations 
have also been associated with adverse outcomes. Of 
27 patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass sur- 
gery,13 six patients who had symptomatic cardiac events 
had a Hct level below 28% (a Hb concentration of approxi- 
mately 93 g/L). 
Because there is a wide range of Hb concentrations 
for transfusion, and because anemia and transfusions are 
independently associated with morbidity and mortality, 
a deﬁnitive study is needed to determine the effect of 
anemia. However, barriers to recruitment and adherence 
need to be identiﬁed so they can be addressed before a 
larger deﬁnitive study.14 Clinical uncertainty resulting 
from 1) apprehension about transfusion, 2) concern that 
the transfusion thresholds are not consistent with clinical 
practice, 3) not knowing which treatment is best, and 4) 
the concern that the doctor–patient relationship could be 
adversely affected by trial participation have been shown 
to be deterrents in previous randomized controlled tri- 
als.15,16 Therefore, a pilot study is required to determine the 
acceptability and feasibility of the transfusion strategies 
by physicians and patients because it is anticipated that 
enrollment and adherence will be low. The objective of 
this study was to determine enrollment and adherence 
with a protocol for Hb transfusion strategies in patients 
having cardiac surgery. 




A single-center open-labeled parallel randomized con- 
trolled pilot trial of two transfusion strategies in patients 
having elective cardiac surgery was conducted to deter- 
mine enrollment and adherence to Hb concentrations 
used for 
randomization 
sequence was created using permuted blocks of four 
stratiﬁed by age and the Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Score 
(CARE) score.17 Opaque sequential sealed envelopes were 
used and opened at the start of surgery. The allocation 
sequence was generated by an independent statistician 
at the Ottawa Methods Centre of the Ottawa Hospital 
Research Institute. The research coordinator enrolled 
participants and assigned participants to the trans- 
fusion strategies. The study was approved by the research 
ethics board at St Michael’s Hospital and written in- 
formed consent was obtained from all patients before 
randomization. 
Eligible participants were identiﬁed in the preopera- 
tive clinic or hospital ward at St Michael’s Hospital 
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) from 2007 to 2010. St Micha- 
el’s Hospital is a university-afﬁliated tertiary care center 
with approximately 1000 cardiac surgeries conducted 
yearly. 
Patients were allocated to one of two transfusion 
strategies. Patients allocated to a “restrictive” transfusion 
strategy received RBC transfusions if their Hb was 70 g/L 
or less during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and 75 g/L 
or less postoperatively after bypass. Patients allocated to a 
“liberal” transfusion strategy received RBC transfusions if 
their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or less during and less 
than 100 g/L after bypass. A lower Hb concentration for 
transfusion was used during CPB because metabolic 
demands are reduced during anesthesia and CPB. When a 
threshold was reached, each group was to receive 1 unit of 
RBCs administered at a time followed by determination of 
the Hb concentration. The transfusion protocols were to 
be adhered to from beginning of surgery until discharge 
from hospital. Patients who had rapid blood loss were 
transfused at the discretion of the attending physician. All 
other aspects of patient care were left to the discretion of 
the attending physicians. 
All outcomes were prespeciﬁed. The primary objec- 
tive was to assess the enrollment rate and overall adher- 
ence to the transfusion strategies. We deﬁned successful 
adherence as adherence to the transfusion strategies in 
90% of patients in more than 90% of their days in hospital. 
Adherence was deﬁned as transfusion of RBCs according 
to the Hb threshold. 
Secondary outcomes included RBC transfusions, 
clinical outcomes, and physiologic indicators of hypox- 
emia (mixed venous oxygen saturation). Clinical out- 
comes were deﬁned as 1) in-hospital all-cause mortality; 
2) a composite score of morbidity consisting of a) neuro- 
logic events deﬁned as a new focal neurologic deﬁcit 
lasting more than 24 hours or irreversible encephalopathy, 
b) dialysis-dependent renal failure or greater than 50% 
increase in creatinine, c) prolonged low cardiac output 
state (i.e., need for two or more inotropes for 24 hours or 
more, 
intraaortic balloon pump or ventricular assist 
device for greater than 48 h), and/or myocardial infarc- 
tion, deﬁned as troponin I level greater than 2.5 mg/L and 
new Q waves on electrocardiogram or a clinical diagnosis; 
and 3) hospital lengths of stay. We assembled an indepen- 
dent data safety monitoring board consisting of a cardiac 
anesthesiologist and a hematologist who reviewed the 
data after 20 patients were recruited. 

Eligible participants were adults patients undergoing 
cardiac surgery with a CARE score (a score for cardiac 
surgery patients used to predict morbidity and mortality) 
of 3 or 4,17 or patients of advanced age deﬁned as greater 
than or equal to 80 years on the day of screening were 
included. A CARE score of 3 is deﬁned as patients with 
uncontrolled medical problems such as unstable angina 
treated with intravenous heparin or nitroglycerin, use of a 
preoperative intraaortic balloon pump, heart failure with 
pulmonary or peripheral edema, uncontrolled hyperten- 
sion, renal insufﬁciency (creatinine level greater than 
140 mmol/L), debilitating systemic diseases, or patients in 
whom a complex surgery is undertaken (i.e., reoperation, 
combined valve and coronary artery surgery, multiple 
valve surgery, left ventricular aneurysmectomy, repair of 
ventricular septal defect after myocardial infarction, or 
CABG of diffuse or heavily calciﬁed vessels). A CARE score 
of 4 is deﬁned as patients with any uncontrolled medical 
problem and in whom a complex surgery is undertaken.17 
These patients were selected as transfusion rates in these 
individuals are high (e.g., reoperation, combined valve 
and coronary artery surgery,18-20 renal insufﬁciency18,21,22). 
Patients were excluded if they refused participation, were 
unable to receive or refused blood products, or were 
involved in the autologous predonation program. 

All patients remained on their preoperative medications 
as directed until the surgical date. Patients were anesthe- 
tized using a narcotic (1-2 mg/kg sufentanil or 10-20 mg/kg 
fentanyl), a benzodiazepine (0.1-0.15 mg/kg midazolam), 
0.2% to 1.5% isoﬂurane, and/or 50-100 mg/kg/min propo- 
fol, with muscle relaxation provided from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg 
rocuronium or 0.15 mg/kg pancuronium. Heparin was 
given to maintain an activated clotting time of more than 
420 seconds during CPB. Bypass management included 
nonpulsatile pump ﬂow of 2.4 ¥ body surface area, mean 

arterial pressure 55 to 85 mmHg, temperature 33 to 35°C, 
and blood sugar 4 to 10 mmol/L. Myocardial protection 
was achieved with cold blood crystalloid cardioplegia, and 
a “hot-shot” (250 to 500 mL) was delivered just before the 
removal of the aortic cross-clamp. After separation from 
CPB, heparin was reversed with protamine (approx. 
10 mg/1000 units of heparin) to normalize the activated 
clotting time. Postoperatively, patients were managed in a 
specialized cardiovascular intensive care unit with stan- 
dardized protocols for early extubation (2-4 hr). Intraop- 
erative use of antiﬁbrinolytic agents and cell salvage are 
routinely used at the study site and were used at the dis- 
cretion of the surgical team. 

Continuous variables were described as mean (standard 
deviation [SD]) or medians (with interquartile range [IQR]) 
if the data were not normally distributed. Categorical vari- 
ables were described as numbers and percentages.We ana- 
lyzed adherence rates and also examined the effect of the 
transfusion strategies on the clinical outcomes using 
univariate analysis, t test, and Mann-Whitney U test for 
continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical 
variables (or the Fisher’s exact test if the expected number 
in any cell was less than 5). The signiﬁcance level was set at 
a p value of less than 0.05 for all statistical analyses. All 
analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis. 
A total sample size of 50 patients was estimated to 
produce a 97.5% CI equal to the sample adherence preva- 
lence plus or minus 8% when the true prevalence of 
adherence was hypothesized to be 90%. Therefore, 25 
patients were randomized to the restrictive group and 25 
patients were randomized to the liberal group. We esti- 
mated our sample size using computer software (PASS 
2002, NCSS, Kaysville, UT). 

A ﬂow diagram for the 50 patients recruited in this study 
demonstrated that a high percentage of individuals were 
not eligible and a considerable proportion declined part- 
icipation in the study (Fig. 1). Enrollment rate was less 
than 1%. 
The characteristics of the patients according to allo- 
cation group are listed in Table 1. There were no signiﬁ- 
cant differences between the groups with regard to age, 
height, weight, and comorbid illnesses. Intraoperatively, 
the duration of CPB and cross-clamping were similar for 
both groups as were the volume of estimated intraopera- 
tive blood loss and the number of attempts to separate 
from CPB. Seventy-two percent of patients in the restric- 
tive group and 68% of patients in the liberal group were 
using antiplatelet (PLT) medications before surgery. Anti- 
PLT medications tended to be discontinued earlier in the

did not achieve signiﬁcance (median 5 days, IQR 6 days vs. 
median 1 day, IQR 7 days; p = 0.9). Twenty-eight percent of 
patients in the restrictive group and 32% of patients in the 
liberal group were taking anticoagulants preoperatively. 
All patients received antiﬁbrinolytics except one patient in 
the restrictive group. Two patients in the restrictive group 
received aprotinin. 
Overall, 13 patients were transfused 50 units in the 
restrictive group compared to 22 (88%) patients who were 
transfused 99 units of RBCs in the liberal group (p < 0.01 
for the number of units transfused). Intraoperatively, 14 
RBC units were transfused to the restrictive group com- 
pared to 48 units of RBCs administered to the liberal group 
(p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). Table 2 illustrates the proportion of 
patients transfused RBCs, plasma, and PLTs.

Table 3 illustrates the adherence data. The median 
number of days of adherence to the transfusion strategy 
was 8 days (IQR, 12 days) in the restrictive arm and 6 days 
(IQR, 3 days) in the liberal arm (p = 0.04). Adherence was 
calculated as the proportion of triggers that resulted in 
transfusions administered according to the transfusion 
strategy (i.e., below the Hb transfusion threshold attained 
and patient was transfused/transfusion threshold attained 
for all patients). RBC units transfused for excessive bleed- 
ing were not included in the calculation of adherence data 
as the protocol was suspended if a patient was rapidly 
bleeding. If 2 units of RBCs were trans- 
fused after one Hb measurement, the 
ﬁrst unit was considered adherent if 
the Hb threshold was attained; however, 
the second unit was not considered 
adherent because only one RBC unit 
was to be transfused for each trigger 
attained. The adherence table (Table 3) 
also does not include data for units 
transfused in the absence of a known Hb 
concentration. For patients allocated to 
the restrictive strategy, adherence was 
69% in the operating room, 82% in the 
intensive care unit, and 100% on the 
ward. For the liberal group, adherence 
was 40% in the operating room, 69% in 
the intensive care unit, and 14% on 
the ward. There were 10 RBC units in the 
restrictive group and 3 units in the 
liberal group that were transfused in 
the absence of a Hb transfusion thresh- 
old being attained. Thus adherence 
overall was 84% in the restrictive group 
and 41% in the liberal group. Reasons for 
nonadherence included patient refusal, 
the use of hemoconcentration, hemor- 
rhage, the Hct and not the Hb concentra- 
tion being used to transfuse the patient,

confusion about the transfusion strategy and whether it 
was to be applied on the ward, hyperkalemia, the physician 
planning to repeat the complete blood count before trans- 
fusing the patient, and the perfusionist being occupied. 
The rationale for nonadherence was not well described for 
the remainder of the transfusions. 
The mean Hb concentrations were similar preopera- 
tively but after surgery the Hb concentrations began to 
diverge (Fig. 2). The differences in Hb concentration 
increased as the hospital stay increased (p < 0.01). The 
mean Hb concentration on Day 6 for the restrictive group 
was 91.1 g/L and for 
the liberal group 107.0 g/L 
(p = 0.0004). 
The mixed venous oxygen saturation was measured 
in some patients (11 patients in the liberal group and four 
patients in the restrictive group) with a pulmonary artery 
catheter as a sign of tissue hypoxia (Fig. 4). There were no 
differences in the mixed venous oxygen saturation before 
or after RBC transfusion in the restrictive or liberal group. 
We did not detect signiﬁcant differences in any of the 
adverse outcomes (Table 4); however, the total number of 
adverse events was 38 (including death) in the restrictive 
strategy group compared to 15 in the liberal strategy (OR, 
6.4; 95% CI, 2.8-14.9). There were four deaths in the 
restrictive group and one in the liberal group. In the 
restrictive strategy, one patient died of respiratory failure

one patient had a cerebrovascular accident. The cause of

shock. 

This is the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial in patients 
undergoing cardiac surgery to focus on adherence rates to 
transfusion strategies in a patient population where there 
is variability in transfusion practice and clinical equipoise 
in selecting transfusion thresholds. The trend for reduced 
adherence in the liberal group suggests an unproven bias 
that cardiac surgery patients require lower thresholds 
which may have the potential to inﬂuence practice and 
study outcomes. The importance of the determination of 
adherence rates to transfusion strategies cannot be under- 
stated because adherence rates can affect outcomes if a 
considerable proportion of patients do not receive a trans- 
fusion according to their transfusion strategy. Experimen- 
tal data can be difﬁcult to interpret if a high proportion of 
patients do not receive transfusion according to the trans- 
fusion threshold or if patients only receive a transfusion 
during presumed critical periods of reduced oxygen 
supply, that is, intraoperatively and in the intensive care 
unit. Adherence to transfusion strate- 
gies should occur throughout the entire 
hospital stay since changes in trans- 
fusion practice may impact patient 
outcomes regardless of when the trans- 
fusion was received in the periope- 
rative period. There is evidence that 
preoperative and intraoperative anemia 
and transfusion are associated with 
increased adverse events and length of 
stay, and adverse events are increased 
by the number of RBC transfusions.6,23,24 
The recently published single- 
center Transfusion Requirements after 
Cardiac Surgery study (TRACS; a ran- 
domized controlled trial of two trans- 
fusion strategies in cardiac surgery 
patients) highlights the need for recruit-

ward in the liberal group could confound a study of trans- 
fusion. The lack of adherence likely reﬂects the preference 
for a restrictive transfusion strategy at our hospital and 
patient preference due to educational information admin- 
istered to them about the risks of transfusion during hos- 
pitalization. These adherence rates are lower than we had 
anticipated and reﬂects the challenges of conducting 
studies in transfusion medicine in this patient population 
that need to be surmounted. For example, as a result of this 
study we will revise our consent form to highlight the 
potential risk of not receiving a transfusion and the uncer- 
tainty for the need of transfusion. In addition, the lack of 
adherence also reﬂects how adherence is deﬁned and 
calculated. 
Although not our primary outcome, patients allo- 
cated to a lower Hb concentration experienced more 
adverse events. This occurred despite a lack of signiﬁcant 
difference in the mixed venous oxygen saturation. It has 
been well established that reduction in mixed venous 
oxygen saturation is a poor surrogate of focal tissue 
hypoxia as focal reductions in vital organs have been dem- 
onstrated in the absence of changes in venous satura- 
tion.27 In addition, the pilot study was not powered to 
detect a difference in the mixed venous oxygen saturation. 
Nonetheless, the higher frequency of adverse events 
potentially related to tissue oxygen delivery suggests that 
further research is needed to determine if patients with 
high-risk features may beneﬁt from higher Hb concentra- 
tions for transfusion. 
Although the TRACS study did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant 
difference in mortality between a Hb concentration of 
80 g/L compared to 100 g/L, the trial was not powered to 
do so. Because mortality rates in cardiac surgery are low, 
thousands of patients would need to be recruited for mor- 
tality as a primary outcome.25 TRACS did ﬁnd a trend to an 
increased risk of cardiogenic shock in patients random- 
ized to a Hb concentration of 80 g/L. There was also a 
suggestion that mortality may be increased in the restric- 
tive group because the hazard ratio for mortality, although 
not signiﬁcant, was 1.28 (95% CI, 0.60-2.73); and the mor- 
tality rate from Day 18 to Day 28 was approximately 3% for 
the liberal strategy but 5% for the restrictive strategy, 
which would be a clinically important difference.25 
There are a few limitations to this study. The enroll- 
ment rate was low; however, considering that patients are 
sensitized to the risk of transfusion before surgery and 
there were several competing studies, these results are not 
unexpected. Future studies need to stress the importance 
of determining the transfusion thresholds and the lack of 
scientiﬁc evidence to support institutional transfusion 
thresholds in this population. The adherence rates on the 
ward were lower than anticipated, likely due to the percep- 
tion that most adverse events secondary to hypoxia would 
be anticipated to occur in the operating room or in the 
intensive care unit. This study was a pilot study and the

resultant low adherence data can direct investigators in 
future trials to provide appropriate education materials to 
all individuals who participate in transfusion of these 
patients to ensure adherence to transfusion strategies. This 
study included patients with high-risk features and there- 
fore cannot be applied to all patients. The rationale for the 
selection of this population was that this population would 
more likely receive a transfusion because of a higher risk of 
organ injury and because they are a group that would most 
likely derive a beneﬁt from the transfusion. Selecting a 
homogenous population potentially also ensures compa- 
rability.28 The choice of triggers and range of Hb concen- 
trations selected reﬂect 1) the values studied in the trans- 
fusion triggers in critical care trial;29 2) the need to have a 
sufﬁcient range difference between strategies so as to have 
the potential to inﬂuence outcomes; 3) representative 
values within the margin of clinical practice as established 
by surveys, variation studies, and clinical guidelines;30 4) 
ranges perceived to be safe by the investigators and experts 
in the ﬁeld;31,32 and 5) the clinical uncertainty of optimum 
Hb concentrations for transfusion.33-37 

transfusion thresholds should 
include detailed information about enrollment and 
adherence rates. Adherence rates and the proportion of 
individuals satisfying these adherence rates should be 
reported for the entire hospitalization. An 80% adherence 
rate is acceptable as previous reports have attained this 
adherence rate,27,30 albeit not for the entire hospitaliza- 
tion. By achieving this adherence rate a deﬁnitive study 
that will require at least 2000 patients can be completed 
and used to guide clinical practice. 
This study identiﬁed barriers to enrollment and 
recruitment so that methods to overcome these barriers 

can be incorporated in future studies to 
improve enrollment and recruitment 
rates. By addressing uncertainty sur- 
rounding transfusion thresholds and 
overtransfusion, future studies may be 
completed in a timely fashion. However, 
additional pilot studies need to be con- 
ducted to ensure enrollment and adher- 
ence before a deﬁnitive randomized 
controlled trial is conducted. 
This pilot study demonstrated that 
there are physician and patient biases 
for transfusion thresholds and that there 
is a need for knowledge translation. The 
pilot study also demonstrated that the 
adherence rates were sufﬁcient in the 
operating room and intensive care unit 
to separate Hb concentrations. Studies 
assessing transfusion strategies should 
report adherence rates because adher- 
ence reﬂects the proportion of patients 
transfused according to the transfusion 
strategy and therefore compliance. Adherence will affect 
the interpretation of outcomes if a high proportion of 
patients are not transfused according to the strategy. This 
study and the TRACS study highlight the need for a large 
multicentered collaborative study to address transfusion 
requirements in this patient population.
