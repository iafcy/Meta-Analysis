A 
BSTRACT 
Background 
To determine whether a restrictive 
strategy of red-cell transfusion and a liberal strategy 
produced equivalent results in critically ill patients, 
we compared the rates of death from all causes at 30 
days and the severity of organ dysfunction. 
Methods 
We enrolled 838 critically ill patients with 
euvolemia after initial treatment who had hemoglobin 
concentrations of less than 9.0 g per deciliter within 
72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit 
and randomly assigned 418 patients to a restrictive 
strategy of transfusion, in which red cells were trans- 
fused if the hemoglobin concentration dropped below 
7.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations 
were maintained at 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter, and 420 
patients to a liberal strategy, in which transfusions 
were given when the hemoglobin concentration fell 
below 10.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentra- 
tions were maintained at 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter. 
Results 
Overall, 30-day mortality was similar in 
the two groups (18.7 percent vs. 23.3 percent, P= 
0.11). However, the rates were significantly lower 
with the restrictive transfusion strategy among pa- 
tients who were less acutely ill — those with an 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II 
score of «20 (8.7 percent in the restrictive-strategy 
group and 16.1 percent in the liberal-strategy group, 
P=0.03) — and among patients who were less than 
55 years of age (5.7 percent and 13.0 percent, respec- 
tively; P=0.02), but not among patients with clinical- 
ly significant cardiac disease (20.5 percent and 22.9 
percent, respectively; P=0.69). The mortality rate 
during hospitalization was significantly lower in the 
restrictive-strategy group (22.2 percent vs. 28.1 per- 
cent, P=0.05). 
Conclusions 
A restrictive strategy of red-cell 
transfusion is at least as effective as and possibly su- 
perior to a liberal transfusion strategy in critically ill 
patients, with the possible exception of patients with 
acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

ED-cell transfusions are a cornerstone of 
critical care practice, 
 but there are diver- 
1 
gent views on the risks of anemia and the 
benefits of transfusion in this setting. One 
important concern is that anemia may not be well 
tolerated by critically ill patients. 
 Indeed, two re- 
cent studies suggested that anemia increases the risk 
of death after surgery in patients with cardiac disease 
2 
and in critically ill patients. 
 Red-cell transfusions are 
3 
used to augment the delivery of oxygen in the hope 
of avoiding the deleterious effects of oxygen debt. 
4 
This view prompted the routine use of transfusion 
in patients with hemoglobin concentrations that were 
often more than 10.0 g per deciliter in studies eval- 
uating resuscitation protocols. 



Critically ill patients may, however, be at increased 
 and microcircu- 
risk for the immunosuppressive 
,8 
7 
 complications of red-cell transfusions. In ad- 
latory 
dition, concern about the supply and safety of blood 
has also encouraged a conservative approach to trans- 
fusions. For these reasons, the optimal transfusion 
practice for various types of critically ill patients with 
anemia has not been established. 
To elucidate the potential risks of anemia and pos- 
sible benefits of transfusions in critically ill patients, 
we conducted a randomized, controlled, clinical trial 
to determine whether a restrictive approach to red- 
cell transfusion that maintains hemoglobin concen- 
trations between 7.0 and 9.0 g per deciliter is equiv-

alent to a more liberal strategy of maintaining hemo- 
globin concentrations between 10.0 and 12.0 g per 
deciliter in critically ill patients with euvolemia after 
initial treatment. 


We enrolled patients who were admitted to 1 of 22 tertiary-lev- 
el and 3 community intensive care units in Canada (see the Ap- 
pendix) between November 1994 and November 1997. We in- 
cluded patients who were expected to stay in the intensive care 
unit more than 24 hours, had a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 
g per deciliter or less within 72 hours after admission to the in- 
tensive care unit, and were considered to have euvolemia after ini- 
tial treatment by attending physicians. Patients were excluded for 
any of the following reasons: an age of less than 16 years; inability 
to receive blood products; active blood loss at the time of enroll- 
ment, defined as evidence of ongoing blood loss accompanied by 
a decrease in the hemoglobin concentration of 3.0 g per deciliter 
in the preceding 12 hours or a requirement for at least 3 units of 
packed red cells during the same period; chronic anemia, defined 
as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 9.0 g per deciliter on 
at least one occasion more than one month before admission to 
the hospital; pregnancy; brain death or imminent death (within 
24 hours); a question on the part of attending physicians whether 
to withhold or withdraw ongoing treatment; and admission after 
a routine cardiac surgical procedure. The study protocol was ap- 
proved by the institutional review board of each participating in- 
stitution, and informed consent was obtained from either the pa- 
tient or the closest family member before enrollment in the study. 

Consecutive critically ill patients with normovolemia were as- 
signed to one of two treatment groups, stratified according to 
center and disease severity (an Acute Physiology and Chronic 
Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score of 15 or less or a score of 
more than 15, with higher scores indicating more severe dis- 
 and balanced with the use of permuted blocks of four or 
ease), 
11 
six. 
 Sealed, opaque envelopes arranged in a computer-generated 
12 
random order were prepared by the data-coordinating center and 
distributed to each participating institution, where they were 
opened sequentially to determine the patients’ treatment assign- 
ments. The envelopes were returned periodically to the coordi- 
nating center for auditing. 



Transfusion guidelines for both study groups were developed 
from information obtained in a national survey of critical care 
practitioners in Canada 
 The hemoglobin 
concentrations of patients assigned to the restrictive strategy of 
transfusion were maintained in the range of 7.0 to 9.0 g per dec- 
iliter, with a transfusion given when the hemoglobin concentra- 
tion fell below 7.0 g per deciliter. Among patients assigned to the 
liberal strategy of transfusion, the hemoglobin concentrations 
were maintained in the range of 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter, with 
a threshold for transfusion of 10.0 g per deciliter. It was not fea- 
sible to mask the assigned transfusion strategy from health care 
providers. 
In Canada, red cells are separated from whole blood and stored 
in citrate–phosphate–dextrose–adenine anticoagulant solution 
without leukodepletion. The volume of a unit of red cells ranges 
from 240 to 340 ml, with a hematocrit of approximately 80 per- 
cent. 

The physicians caring for the patients were instructed to ad- 
minister transfusions, one unit at a time, and to measure a pa- 
tient’s hemoglobin concentration after each unit was transfused. 
Although specific goals for oxygen delivery were not part of the 
protocol, we provided suggestions for the use of fluids and vaso- 
active drugs, when necessary, and advice when a transfusion was 
not indicated by the study protocol. All other management deci- 
sions were left to the discretion of the patients’ physicians. Adher- 



ence to the transfusion protocols was required only during the 
patient’s stay in the intensive care unit. When a patient was dis- 
charged from the intensive care unit, a copy of the American Col- 
 was placed in his or 
lege of Physicians guidelines for transfusion 
her medical record. 

Compliance with the two transfusion protocols was monitored 
by daily measurements of hemoglobin concentrations in each pa- 
tient. In addition, transfusion records were sent regularly to the 
study coordinating center, which monitored the ability of individual 
centers to maintain hemoglobin concentrations in the target range. 


At the time of randomization, demographic, diagnostic, and 
therapeutic information as well as information necessary to deter- 
mine the severity of illness — including APACHE II scores, 
 cal- 
culated from data gathered within 24 hours after admission to the 
 — 
intensive care unit, and the multiple-organ-dysfunction score 
was obtained for each patient. The worst laboratory values re- 
corded during each patient’s stay in the intensive care unit were 
noted for use in assessing organ dysfunction with use of the mul- 
tiple-organ-dysfunction score 
 and the multiple-system organ- 
failure score. 
 Hemoglobin concentrations; the use of red-cell 
18 
transfusions; medications given, including vasoactive drugs; and 
the need for mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and surgical inter- 
vention were recorded on a daily basis. 


The principal reason for admission to the intensive care unit 
was recorded. We included as many as three secondary diagnoses 
and eight coexisting conditions. In postoperative patients, the un- 
derlying diagnosis and the surgical procedure were recorded. All 
data were abstracted from clinical records by trained study per- 
International Classification of 
sonnel and coded according to the 
Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification. 
 All diagnoses were 
reviewed by two of the four critical care physicians, and disagree- 
ments were resolved by consensus. 


The primary outcome measure was death from all causes in the 
30 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included 60- 
day rates of death from all causes, mortality rates during the stay 
in the intensive care unit and during hospitalization, and survival 
times in the first 30 days. Measures of organ failure and dysfunc- 
tion, including the number and rates of organ failure as defined 
previously 
 were also 
 and the multiple-organ-dysfunction score, 
assessed. To improve our ability to detect meaningful differences 
between groups, we used some composite outcomes that includ- 
ed death and organ dysfunction or failure as indicators of morbid- 
ity. Patients who died were assigned a multiple-system organ-fail- 
ure score of 7 and a multiple-organ-dysfunction score of 24, the 
worst possible values for each scale, as a means of adjusting meas- 
ures of organ dysfunction and failure for deaths. Lengths of stays 
in the intensive care unit and the hospital were also recorded. 


Since this was an equivalency trial, we used 95 percent confi- 
dence intervals to estimate the number of patients necessary for 
the study to have the power to rule out clinically meaningful dif- 
ferences in outcomes. We estimated that 2300 patients would be 
needed to rule out an absolute difference of 4 percent in 30-day 
mortality between the two groups, assuming a combined mortal- 
ity rate of 18 percent (the rate for a group receiving standard care 
). An interim analysis conducted 
was estimated to be 20 percent 
3 
in a blinded fashion by the data-monitoring committee after 404 
patients had been enrolled revealed that the combined 30-day 
mortality rate was actually 23 percent. This change increased the 
detectable difference to 4.5 percent for a sample of 2300 patients. 
Because of this increase in observed mortality, we decided to de- 
crease the target sample to 1620 patients (primarily on the basis 
of the hypothesis-testing method, in which the mortality rate for 
the standard-care group was 26.6 percent, the type 1 and type 2 
error rates were 5 percent, and there was no change in the relative

risk of 27.5 percent from the original estimate of sample size). 
The recalculated sample size allowed us to rule out an absolute 
difference in the 30-day mortality rate of 5.5 percent between 
groups. 
The final analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. 
Comparisons of hemoglobin concentrations over time were made 
with use of analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed 
by Tukey’s honestly-significant-difference test for pairwise com- 
parisons. 
Mortality rates, the number of organs that failed per patient, 
and the rates of multiorgan failure were compared with use of 
Fisher’s exact test. A forward, stepwise logistic-regression proce- 
dure was then performed to adjust raw mortality data with use of 
covariates that were found to be significant predictors of out- 
comes. Covariates were entered into the logistic model at a P val- 
ue of «0.10. A second logistic regression was performed in which 
potential confounders, including age, APACHE II score, coexist- 
ing illnesses, diagnostic category, and study center, were forced 
into the model. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for each group 
were compared with use of a log-rank test statistic. Multiple- 
organ-dysfunction scores were analyzed with use of an independ- 
ent t-test. To account for the influence of death on the assessment 
of organ failure and organ dysfunction, we conducted an addi- 
tional analysis in which all patients who died were assigned the 
maximal scores. The complication rates were compared with use 
of a chi-square test. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and 
the hospital were analyzed with use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test for independent samples. 
A priori subgroup analyses of patients at potential risk for the 
adverse effects of anemia included patients who were 55 years of 
age or older, patients with cardiac disease, and patients with 
APACHE II scores indicating more severe illness. In the final 
analysis, we increased the threshold value for APACHE II scores 
from 15 to 20 because less than 20 percent of all patients had an 
APACHE II score below 15 and because a score of 20 was con- 
sidered to be a better indicator of severe illness. We also examined 
patients with systemic infections. Differences in primary out- 
comes were considered statistically significant when the overall 
two-sided alpha level was 0.05 or less. No adjustments were made 
for multiple comparisons. Where appropriate, absolute P values 
are reported with 95 percent confidence intervals for differences 
between the groups. 


A total of 6451 patients were assessed for eligibil- 
ity (Fig. 1). After exclusions for a variety of medical 
and administrative reasons, 838 patients were en-

rolled in the study: 418 patients were assigned to a 
restrictive strategy of transfusion and 420 were as- 
signed to a liberal strategy of transfusion. The con- 
sent rate was 41 percent (838 of 2039 patients). As 
compared with the patients who were enrolled in 
the study, those who were not enrolled were slightly 
older (mean [±SD] age, 57.6±18.2 vs. 59.4±18.8 
years; P=0.04), but they had similar APACHE II 
scores (P=0.36) and diagnoses (P=0.26) with the 
exception of cardiac disease. Twenty-six percent of 
enrolled patients had cardiac disease, as compared 
with 20 percent of those who were not enrolled 
(P<0.01). Nine patients (1 percent) did not com- 
plete the trial; four were in the liberal-strategy group 
and five were in the restrictive-strategy group. Three 
additional patients were lost to follow-up at 60 days. 
The executive committee, without foreknowledge of 
treatment-specific outcomes, decided to terminate 
the study prematurely because of a decrease in en- 
rollment to below 20 percent of predicted levels over 
a period of several months. 
There were no significant differences in any base- 
line characteristics between the two groups (Table 
1). The two most common reasons for admission to 
the intensive care unit were respiratory and cardiac 
diseases. The average APACHE II score was 21, and 
more than 80 percent of the patients were receiving 
mechanical ventilation. A total of 222 patients (26.5 
percent) had an infection as either a primary or a 
secondary diagnosis. 

The average daily hemoglobin concentrations 
were 8.5±0.7 g per deciliter in the restrictive-strat- 
egy group and 10.7±0.7 g per deciliter in the liber- 
al-strategy group (P<0.01). The average hemoglo- 
bin concentrations also differed significantly between 
the groups during each day of the 30-day study (P< 
0.01). An average of 2.6±4.1 red-cell units per pa- 
tient was administered in the restrictive-strategy 
group, as compared with an average of 5.6±5.3 units 
per patient in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.01). 
This equals a relative decrease of 54 percent in the 
number of transfusions when the lower threshold was 
used. In addition, 33 percent of the patients in the re- 
strictive-strategy group did not receive any red cells 
after randomization, as compared with 0 percent of 
the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.01). 
Noncompliance of physicians with the study regi- 
men, as indicated by a finding of hemoglobin con- 
centrations outside the prespecified ranges for at 
least 48 hours, occurred in 4.3 percent of patients in 
the liberal-strategy group (18 of 420) and 1.4 per- 
cent of patients in the restrictive-strategy group (6 of 
418) (P=0.02). A subgroup of these patients were 
inadvertently crossed over from one group to the 
other when physicians either administered or with- 
held red-cell transfusions. The overall rate of cross-

over was 1.8 percent (15 of 838): 2.6 percent (11) 
in the liberal-strategy group and 1 percent (4) in the 
restrictive-strategy group (P=0.12). 
Given that the investigators were aware of the pa- 
tients’ treatment assignments, other interventions may 
have influenced outcomes. The use of medications, 
including vasoactive drugs; the administration of flu- 
ids and daily fluid balance; and the use of pulmo- 
nary-artery catheters were similar in both groups 
throughout the stay in the intensive care unit (P= 
0.15). The use of other interventions such as dialy- 
sis, mechanical ventilation, and surgical procedures 
was also similar (P=0.58). 

The primary outcome — the rate of death from 
all causes in the 30 days after admission to the in- 
tensive care unit — was 18.7 percent in the restric- 
tive-strategy group and 23.3 percent in the liberal- 
strategy group (95 percent confidence interval for 
the difference between the groups, ¡0.84 percent 
to 10.2 percent; P=0.11) (Table 2). The mortality 
rates during hospitalization were lower in the restric- 
tive-strategy group (22.2 percent vs. 28.1 percent, 
P=0.05). Other mortality rates including the mor- 
tality rate during the entire stay in the intensive care 
unit (13.9 percent vs. 16.2 percent, P=0.29) and 
the 60-day mortality rate (22.7 percent vs. 26.5 per- 
cent, P=0.23) were also lower in the restrictive- 
strategy group but not significantly so. 
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were similar for the 
patient group as a whole, but they were significant- 
ly different in the subgroup of patients with an 
APACHE II score of 20 or less (P=0.02) and in the 
subgroup of patients who were younger than 55 years 
(P=0.02) (Fig. 2). The unadjusted odds ratio for 
death within 30 days in the restrictive-strategy group 
as compared with the liberal-strategy group was 
0.75 (P=0.09). Adjustment for the influence of age, 
APACHE II score, diagnosis, and coexisting illnesses 
with use of logistic-regression analysis did not change 
the odds ratio significantly (odds ratio, 0.72; 95 per- 
cent confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.07; P=0.07). 

The number of patients with multiorgan failure 
(more than three organs), which was analyzed as 
a dichotomous variable (present or absent) for each 
of seven organ systems, 
 was not significantly differ- 
ent between the restrictive-strategy and liberal-strat- 
egy groups (5.3 percent vs. 4.3 percent, P=0.36). 
The mean multiple-organ-dysfunction score was mar- 
ginally lower in the restrictive-strategy group than 
in the liberal-strategy group (8.3±4.6 vs. 8.8±4.4, 
P=0.10). 







 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

gan-failure scores of 7 were assigned to all patients 
who died within 30 days after admission to the in- 
tensive care unit, the number of patients with mul- 
tiorgan failure was substantially increased in both 
groups, and the results were marginally better in the 
restrictive-strategy group (20.6 percent vs. 26.0 per- 
cent, P=0.07). Similarly, when all patients who died 
were given a multiple-organ-dysfunction score of 
24, the total scores (P=0.03) and the changes in the 
scores from base line (P=0.04) were significantly 
lower in the restrictive-strategy group (Table 2). 
Cardiac events, primarily pulmonary edema and 
myocardial infarction, were more frequent in the lib- 
eral-strategy group than in the restrictive-strategy 
group during the stay in the intensive care unit 
(P<0.01) (Table 3). However, there were no signifi- 
cant differences in the rates of cardiac events (41 per- 
cent in the restrictive-strategy group and 44 percent 
in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.86), infectious 
complications (3 percent and 4 percent, respectively; 
P=1.00), or multiorgan failure (37 percent and 32 
percent, respectively; P=0.59) in the 48 hours pre- 
ceding death among the patients who died (Table 4). 

When the patients were analyzed according to age 
(<55 years vs. »55 years) and APACHE II score 
(«20 vs. >20), there were no significant differences 
in base-line characteristics. In the restrictive-strategy 
group, 173 patients were younger than 55 years, 207 
patients had an APACHE II score of 20 or less, 151 
patients had cardiac disease, 100 had a traumatic in- 
jury, and 114 had a severe infection or septic shock. 
In the liberal-strategy group, 161 patients were 
younger than 55 years, 217 had an APACHE II 
score of 20 or less, 175 had cardiac disease, 100 had 
a traumatic injury, and 104 had a severe infection or 
septic shock. All outcomes in the two transfusion- 
strategy groups were similar for the patients who 
were older than 55 years and for those with an 
APACHE II score of more than 20 (P>0.36). How- 
ever, 30-day mortality was significantly lower in the 
restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy 
group among the patients with an APACHE II score 
of 20 or less (8.7 percent vs. 16.1 percent; 95 per- 
cent confidence interval for the absolute difference, 
1.0 to 13.6 percent; P=0.03) and among the pa- 
tients who were less than 55 years of age (5.7 per- 
cent vs. 13.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 
1.1 to 13.5 percent; P=0.02). There were no signif- 
icant differences in 30-day mortality between treat- 
ment groups in the subgroup of patients with a pri- 
mary or secondary diagnosis of cardiac disease (20.5 
percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 22.9 
percent in the liberal-strategy group; 95 percent 
confidence interval for the difference, ¡6.7 to 11.3 
percent; P=0.69), in the subgroup of patients with 
severe infections and septic shock (22.8 percent and

29.7 percent, respectively; P=0.36), or in the sub- 
group of patients with trauma (10.0 percent and 8.8 
percent, respectively; P=0.81). 
The results for the rates of organ dysfunction in the 
subgroups were similar to those for other subgroup 
analyses. The multiple-organ-dysfunction scores ad- 
justed for patients who died did not differ signifi- 
cantly in the subgroup of patients with an APACHE 
II score of more than 20, the subgroup more than 
55 years of age, and the subgroup with specific di- 
agnoses, including cardiac disease, trauma, and se- 
vere infections and septic shock (all P>0.30). How- 
ever, adjusted multiple-organ-dysfunction scores were 
significantly lower in the subgroup of patients with 
an APACHE II score of 20 or less (8.3±6.2 in the 
restrictive-strategy group and 10.0±7.2 in the liber- 
al-strategy group, P=0.01) and in the subgroup of 
patients who were younger than 55 years of age 
(8.8±5.7 and 10.3±6.6, respectively; P=0.03). 

Our findings indicate that the use of a threshold 
for red-cell transfusion as low as 7.0 g of hemoglo- 
bin per deciliter, combined with maintenance of he- 
moglobin concentrations in the range of 7.0 to 
9.0 g per deciliter, was at least as effective as and 
possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy 
(threshold, 10.0 g per deciliter; maintenance range, 
10.0 to 12.0) in critically ill patients with normovo- 
lemia. There was a trend toward decreased 30-day 
mortality among patients who were treated accord- 
ing to the restrictive transfusion strategy. The signif- 
icant differences in mortality rates during hospital- 
ization, rates of cardiac complications, and rates of 
organ dysfunction all favored the restrictive strategy. 
We also found that maintaining hemoglobin con- 
centrations in the range of 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter 
decreased the average number of red-cell units trans- 
fused by 54 percent and decreased exposure to any 
red cells after randomization by 33 percent. Con- 
cern about exposure to blood products has increased 
the use of expensive drugs such as epoetin alfa and 
aprotinin, which reduce perioperative exposure by 
an average of one to two red-cell units, with little ev- 
idence of overall effectiveness. In contrast, a simple 
and inexpensive intervention that lowers the transfu- 
sion threshold improved clinical outcomes and re- 
duced exposure to red cells. 






A number of randomized, controlled clinical trials 
have addressed the hypothesis that oxygen delivery 
should be increased or maintained at high levels to 
minimize the effects of tissue hypoxia caused by dis- 
ease processes that interfere with oxygen delivery or 
the body’s ability to extract oxygen. One meta-analy- 
sis24 found that oxygen delivery was increased when 
oxygen therapy was initiated preoperatively, but this 
benefit was not observed in studies that evaluated 
patients admitted to the intensive care unit. In all 
the previous studies, the transfusion thresholds ex- 
ceeded 10.0 g per deciliter; therefore, it was not pos- 
sible to make inferences about optimal strategies for 
red-cell transfusion. In our study, red-cell transfu- 
sions, used as a means of augmenting oxygen deliv- 
ery, did not offer any survival advantage in patients 
with normovolemia when hemoglobin concentra- 
tions exceeded 7.0 g per deciliter. 
There is also concern about the adverse effects of 
anemia in patients with ischemic heart disease. Two 
large cohort studies found that an increasing severity 
of anemia was associated with a disproportionate in- 
crease in mortality rates among patients with ische- 
mic heart disease.2,3 In our study, however, patients 
with diagnoses of cardiac disease did not have more 
adverse outcomes when a transfusion threshold of 
7 
.0 g per deciliter was used. The apparent discrepan- 
cy between our results and those of previous studies 
may be the result of confounding3 or an inability to 
document the negative effects of transfusion2 in the 
observational studies. 
In most clinical trials, there are more patients who 
are asked to participate than actually agree to partic- 
ipate. There is therefore a possibility that refusals on 
the part of patients, their surrogates, or their physi- 
cians affect the generalizability of the results. A 
greater proportion of patients with severe cardiac 
disease than with other types of disease had attend- 
ing physicians who declined to enroll them in our 
study. Nevertheless, we believe that a restrictive strat- 
egy can be implemented in patients with coronary 
artery disease but should be considered with caution 
in patients with acute myocardial infarction and un- 
stable angina. 
On the basis of our results, we recommend that 
critically ill patients receive red-cell transfusions 
when their hemoglobin concentrations fall below 
7 
.0 g per deciliter and that hemoglobin concentra- 
tions should be maintained between 7.0 and 9.0 g per 
deciliter. The diversity of the patients enrolled in this 
trial and the consistency of the results suggest that 
our conclusions may be generalized to most critical- 
ly ill patients, with the possible exception of patients 
with active coronary ischemic syndromes.

†No data on complications or interventions were available for the 42 
patients who died outside the intensive care unit. Complications or inter- 
ventions were recorded for 134 patients who died in the intensive care 
unit: 61 in the restrictive-strategy group and 73 in the liberal-strategy 
group. 
A recent systematic review of transfusion prac- 
tice19 identified five randomized, controlled clinical 
trials that compared clinical outcomes after the im- 
plementation of two transfusion strategies. The only 
large trial, in patients with chronic anemia due to 
sickle cell disease, did not demonstrate decreases in 
the incidence of sickle cell crises among patients 
assigned to a liberal transfusion strategy.20 The four 
other trials were quite small. Two studies in patients 
undergoing bypass surgery21,22 and our pilot study14 
did not find differences between the transfusion 
strategies but were too small to yield clinically useful 
inferences. The fifth trial, in patients with nonvar- 
iceal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, found that admin- 
istering transfusions liberally or expectantly resulted 
not only in increased overall use of transfusions but 
also in a higher frequency of coagulation abnor- 
malities.23
