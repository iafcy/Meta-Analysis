Objective To determine whether extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) trans- 
fused at lower hemoglobin thresholds versus higher thresholds have different rates of 
survival or morbidity at discharge. 
Study design Infants weighing <1000 g birth weight were randomly assigned within 
48 hours of birth to a transfusion algorithm of either low or high hemoglobin transfusion 
thresholds. The composite primary outcome was death before home discharge or survival 
with any of either severe retinopathy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or brain injury on 
cranial ultrasound. Morbidity outcomes were assessed, blinded to allocation. 
Results Four hundred ﬁfty-one infants were randomly assigned to low (n (cid:1) 223) or 
high (n (cid:1) 228) hemoglobin thresholds. Groups were similar, with mean birth weight of 
770 g and gestational age of 26 weeks. Fewer infants received one or more transfusions 
in the low threshold group (89% low versus 95% high, P (cid:1) .037). Rates of the primary 
outcome were 74.0% in the low threshold group and 69.7% in the high (P (cid:1) .25; risk 
difference, 2.7%; 95% CI –3.7% to 9.2%). There were no statistically signiﬁcant differ- 
ences between groups in any secondary outcome. 
Conclusions 
In extremely low birth weight infants, maintaining a higher hemoglobin 
level results in more infants receiving transfusions but confers little evidence of beneﬁt.

Canadian births in 1996 to 1997 and 9% of all neonatal intensive care unit 
admissions.1 These newborn infants rapidly become anemic from a combination of 
frequent laboratory blood sampling and an immature hematopoietic system,2-4 leading to 
the transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBCs) in at least 94%.5 RBC transfusion 
guidelines available at the start of this trial6,7 recommended the maintenance of the 
hemoglobin of ELBW infants at “physiologic” levels, but the justiﬁcation for such an 
intervention is poorly supported. The risks and beneﬁts of RBC transfusions to ELBW 
infants are unclear: Limiting RBC transfusions may reduce transfusion-associated infec- 
tion and iron overload, but the resulting low hemoglobin levels may result in the 
morbidities associated with chronic anemic hypoxemia. A study in adult patients in critical 
care8 reported no beneﬁt in survival from liberally transfusing allogeneic RBCs to 
maintain a hemoglobin concentration between 100 and 120 g/L. A restrictive RBC

transfusion strategy (maintaining the hemoglobin concentra- 
tion between 70 and 90 g/L) was at least as good as, and, for 
some subgroups, better than the liberal strategy. 
In this randomized, controlled trial, we randomly as- 
signed ELBW newborn infants to RBC transfusion algo- 
rithms, incorporating restrictive or liberal (low or high) he- 
moglobin “thresholds.” The primary outcome was 
a 
composite of either death before home discharge or survival 
with severe morbidity, where severe morbidity was deﬁned as 
one or more of (1) retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), (2) 
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or (3) brain injury on 
cranial ultrasound. This composite outcome captured the 
competing outcomes of death, or survival with severe mor- 
bidity, in one measure. The purpose of this trial was to 
determine whether maintaining ELBW infants at a restrictive 
hemoglobin level, by adopting a restrictive (lower) RBC 
transfusion threshold, led to a difference in clinical outcome 
compared with a liberal RBC transfusion threshold, in the 
ﬁrst weeks of post-natal life. 


Newborn infants were enrolled from 10 neonatal inten- 
sive care units in Canada, the United States, and Australia 
(Appendix; available at www.jpeds.com). Eligible babies were 
required to be of birth weight (cid:1)1000 g, gestational age (cid:1)31 
weeks, and to be (cid:1)48 hours old at the time of enrollment. 
Infants deemed non-viable by the attending physician were 
excluded, as were those with cyanotic heart disease, congenital 
anemia, acute shock, transfusion after 6 hours of age, or 
known parental opposition to transfusions, a family history of 
anemia and hemolytic disease, or where the attending physi- 
cian anticipated using erythropoietin. Informed consent was 
requested from the parents or guardians. After consent, in- 
fants were individually randomly assigned to either the re- 
strictive or the liberal threshold for RBC transfusion. Treat- 
ment allocation was by telephone to an interactive voice 
system at the coordinating center. The concealed computer- 
generated randomization sequence was stratiﬁed by center 
and birth weight ((cid:1)750 g, 751 to 999 g) and incorporated 
random block sizes. The study was approved by each local 
research ethics board.

Infants were allocated to a transfusion algorithm of low 
or high hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion (Table I). The 
algorithm was developed by consensus among participating 
sites, against the background of then current guidelines.6,7 
The appropriate hemoglobin threshold was adjusted for cap- 
illary or arterial/venous blood sampling according to prior 
work.9 The thresholds developed were based on whether or 
not the infant was receiving respiratory support (assisted 
ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or supple- 
mental oxygen) and on post-natal age. The protocol did not 
dictate how or how often the hemoglobin value was to be 
determined, but all hemoglobin values were recorded. Phle- 
botomy losses were not recorded. Transfusion was indicated 
whenever the hemoglobin equaled or fell below the threshold 
value. In addition, attending neonatologists were allowed to 
give non-algorithm dictated RBC transfusions in the event of 
shock, severe sepsis, coagulation defects, surgery, or for un- 
anticipated emergencies. RBC transfusions were given within 
6 hours of the hemoglobin determination, but as soon as 
possible after the attainment of a threshold value. All trans- 
fusions consisted of washed, packed RBCs (homologous or 
directed donation) given at 15 mL/kg at rates determined by 
local policy. No attempt was made to blind caregivers with 
respect to treatment group, as the concealment of hemoglobin 
values was considered both unethical and impractical. The 
transfusion algorithm was distributed widely and placed 
prominently at the site of care of each study patient. The 
allocated transfusion algorithm was maintained after dis- 
charge from tertiary care to the level 2 nursery, but data 
collection was limited to transfusions, hemoglobin levels 
prompting transfusion, and hemoglobin at discharge. All cen- 
ters used iron supplementation according to local guidelines. 

All data, including Score for Acute Physiology (SNAP) 
scores, were collected from entry to discharge by using spe- 
ciﬁcally designed case report forms. Routine care of ELBW 
infants at all participating institutions included ﬁrst-week and 
pre-discharge cranial ultrasounds and pre-discharge retinal 
examination. Donor exposure to RBCs, platelets, and fresh 


frozen plasma was ascertained retrospectively from blood 
bank records at each institution. 

The primary outcome included the main clinically rel- 
evant morbidities experienced before ﬁrst neonatal discharge 
home and was a composite of either death or survival with one 
or more of 
(i) ROP: Grades 3 through 510; 
(ii) BPD: Supplemental oxygen requirement at a postconcep- 

(iii) Brain injury: Presence of cystic periventricular leukoma- 
lacia, intra-parenchymal echodensity, porencephalic cyst, 
or ventriculomegaly on the “worst” cranial ultrasound 
available before discharge.12 
In all infants, these assessments were performed in the 
ﬁrst week of life and before discharge from the tertiary care 
hospital. The presence of severe ROP was based on a locally 
interpreted retinal assessment conducted by an ophthalmol- 
ogist unaware of treatment group. The need for oxygen at 36 
weeks was determined by the attending physician. Cranial 
ultrasounds were interpreted independently by a blinded, 
two-person committee (JM and PG) who reviewed all images; 
where one reviewer disagreed with the local report, the com- 
mittee adjudicated the ﬁnal results. 

Pre-speciﬁed secondary outcomes included hemoglobin 
level, numbers of RBC transfusions, numbers of donor expo- 
sures, rate of growth (as weekly weights and head circumfer- 
ences), and serum ferritin change from early to discharge 
values. Other recorded outcomes included numbers of infants 
with necrotizing enterocolitis or with apnea requiring treat- 
ment and the use of xanthines or doxapram, culture proven 
infections, or requiring post-natal steroids. We also recorded 
time in oxygen, time to extubation, and time to discharge. 

The planned sample size of 424 neonates was based on 
detecting, with 90% power, an absolute risk reduction of 15% 
in either direction (a two-sided (cid:3) of 0.05) for the primary 
outcome. Analyses of outcomes were adjusted for birth weight 
stratum and center, using a logistic regression model. Cumu- 
lative mortality was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier meth- 
od.13 The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat 
basis. Data were reviewed by an external safety and monitor- 
ing committee. One formal interim analysis of efﬁcacy was 
conducted at the mid-point, which required a value of P (cid:1) 
.001 to stop the trial. 


A total of 795 infants were screened for entry into the 
study from January 2000 to February 2003 inclusive, of whom 
694 were eligible and 451 were subsequently randomly as- 
signed (Figure 1; available at www.jpeds.com). Consent was 
not obtained for 136 infants, and the parents of 107 were not 
approached to participate because parents were not available 
or not accessible for consent within 48 hours of birth. Two 
hundred twenty-three infants were allocated to the restrictive 
(low threshold) group and 228 to the liberal (high threshold) 
group. Both groups were similar with respect to initial ma- 
ternal and infant variables, including those reﬂecting severity 
of illness (Table II; available at www.jpeds.com). Birth weight 
was not signiﬁcantly different between those enrolled and 
those eligible but not enrolled (P (cid:2) .28). Numbers recruited 
ranged in the 10 centers from 6 to 94 (median 42). 

From initially similar levels, hemoglobin declined with 
time in both treatment groups but with a weekly mean con- 
sistently higher in the high threshold group (Table III). The 
separation in the mean hemoglobin levels was statistically 
signiﬁcant within the ﬁrst week and stabilized at about 10g/L 
by week 4. The mean hemoglobin separation slowly declined 
during the remainder of the neonatal hospitalization, remain- 
ing statistically signiﬁcantly different up to 12 weeks, becom- 
ing no longer signiﬁcantly different by discharge (Figure 2). 
As a result of maintaining a reduced hemoglobin level, the 
low threshold group received fewer RBC transfusions (mean, 
4.9 units) than the high threshold group (mean, 5.7 units) but 
this difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (P (cid:2) .070). 
However, the mean number of transfusions triggered by a 
hemoglobin threshold was signiﬁcantly lower in the low 
threshold group, but this difference was offset by a small but 
statistically signiﬁcant difference in the opposite direction in 
transfusions given for “clinical reasons,” many of which were 
for bleeding or 
surgery (Table IV; available at www. 
jpeds.com). However, the total number of these transfusions 
was low (7.4% low group versus 3.1% high group). The 
median day of ﬁrst transfusion was 4 days in both groups. By 
discharge from the hospital, 89% of infants in the low thresh- 
old group had received a transfusion either by algorithm or 
clinical decision, compared with 95% in the high threshold 
group (P (cid:2) .037). The mean number of blood product donors 
to which infants were exposed was slightly lower in the low 
threshold group, both for all blood products and for RBCs 
speciﬁcally, but the differences were only statistically signiﬁ- 
cant for RBC donors (P (cid:2) .035). 

The primary outcome was the combination of either 
death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe 
retinopathy of prematurity, or brain injury. The outcome 
status of all infants was known (ie, there was no loss of infant 
data). During the neonatal period, 74.0% of the low threshold 
group had this outcome, compared with 69.7% of infants 
allocated to the high threshold cohort (Table V). The birth 
weight–adjusted and center strata–adjusted difference of 2.7%

.75). The Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 3; available at www. 
jpeds.com) shows no signiﬁcant differences in cumulative 
mortality rates at any time after random assignment. At the 
median follow-up of 12 weeks, the cumulative mortality rate 
approximates the overall mortality rate, as seen in Table V. 
There was no evidence that the treatment effect varied by 
birth weight strata. 

The treatment effects on protocol-designated secondary 
outcomes and other outcomes assessed during hospitalization 
are shown in Table VII. Data for growth were analyzed at 32 
weeks’ corrected age because of varying times of discharge. 
There were no signiﬁcant differences demonstrated in any 
secondary outcomes. In particular, there were no statistically 
signiﬁcant differences in duration of ventilatory support, 
growth, or length of hospital stay. Similarly, the observed 
differences in the other outcomes were all quite consistent 
with chance variation, given the number of comparisons being 
made.

was not statistically signiﬁcant (P (cid:2) .25; 95% CI, (cid:3)3.7% to

components of the composite primary outcome each slightly 
favored the high threshold group, but all differences were 
statistically nonsigniﬁcant. Table VI (available at www.jped- 
s.com) details the frequency of the head ultrasound ﬁndings

outcome between centres was not signiﬁcantly different (P (cid:2) 
In this randomized, controlled trial, we allocated acutely 
ill, ELBW infants during their ﬁrst 2 days of life to an 
algorithm of either a low or a high hemoglobin transfusion 
threshold, which was maintained until discharge. As a result, 
the high threshold group had a mean hemoglobin concentra- 
tion about 10 g/L higher than the low threshold group during 
the ﬁrst 4 weeks of life. This difference in hemoglobin level 
slowly dissipated over the neonatal hospitalization period as

blood sampling declined and the infant matured. This was 
associated with a lower likelihood of receiving at least one 
transfusion in the low threshold group despite a slightly 
higher use of “clinically” driven RBC transfusions. Presum- 
ably, the hemoglobin thresholds in the low threshold group 
resulted in later RBC transfusions as well as a reduction in 
algorithmic determined RBC transfusions when compared 
with the high threshold group. 
No statistically or clinically important between-group 
difference was observed in the primary composite outcome of 
death or neonatal morbidity. The primary composite outcome 
captured the competing risks of death or survival with serious 
morbidity, by combining the most frequent and serious com- 
plications in the ELBW survivors with death. These compli- 
cations (ultrasound brain injury, ROP, BPD) independently 
adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months’ 
corrected age.14 These conditions are thought to result from 
hypoxic ischemia, oxygen radical toxicity, or iron overload 
mediated oxygen toxicity.15-19 Our study was of sufﬁcient size 
to detect a 15% absolute difference in this clinically relevant 
primary outcome with 90% power. Despite this, the 95% 
conﬁdence interval for the true risk difference ranged from 
(cid:3)3.7% (favoring low) to 9.2% (favoring high). Therefore, as 
a worse-case scenario, the prescribing clinician must weigh 
whether adopting a low hemoglobin threshold with a poten- 
tial 9% increase in poor neonatal outcome is offset by the need 
for fewer RBC blood transfusions. Nonetheless, the adjusted 
difference of 2.7% (only slightly favoring the high threshold) 
is most likely the true effect size in the conﬁdence interval 
range. 
Two studies exist of similar strategies to limit early 
transfusions.20,21 One trial, using adjunctive therapy with 
erythropoietin, found no signiﬁcant clinical differences.20 Our 
thresholds were similar to prior recommendations.20-22 In a 
trial of late RBC transfusion, restriction had no effect on the 
incidence or severity of ROP.23 We found no important 
differences in either the composite outcome or the individual 
outcomes over the initial neonatal hospitalization. 
A similar but smaller trial (n (cid:2) 100) by Bell et al21 was 
powered for the primary outcome of number of transfusions. 
They achieved a larger hemoglobin separation and corre- 
spondingly bigger effect on the mean number of transfusions, 
and reported a signiﬁcant difference (in favor of the liberal, 
high threshold group) for the combined outcome of intraven- 
tricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade 4 or periventricular leu- 
komalacia (PVL). This latter combination was not a pre- 
speciﬁed outcome. In addition, Bell et al enrolled infants later 
and may have received up to two prior transfusions; further- 
more, late head ultrasound ﬁndings were reported in only half 
of the infants enrolled. The PINT secondary outcome of 
“brain injury” includes a somewhat different mix of ultrasound 
ﬁndings but shows little evidence of a treatment difference, 
and, if anything, favors the low threshold group. These dis- 
crepant ﬁndings may be attributable to the play of chance, 
differences in protocols of enrollment, and outcome measure- 
ment. 
Before the current generation of trials,20-23 two small, 
randomized trials were performed in larger, more stable in- 
fants.24,25 No differences in short-term outcomes were de- 
scribed. Prior recommendations for allogeneic RBC transfu- 
sion were derived from small, non-randomized studies, 
advocating allogeneic RBC transfusions to prevent apnea, to 
foster weight gain and growth,26 or to increase oxygenation in 
ventilated infants.27 Others have challenged the notion of 
impaired oxygenation from lower hemoglobin values,28 al- 
though other observational studies caution against lower he- 
moglobins.29 None of the secondary outcomes in our study 
indicate the presence of harm from adopting a lower trans- 
fusion threshold regimen. The lack of statistically signiﬁcant, 
important differences in numbers of infants with apnea are 
consistent with studies of apnea frequency measured objec- 
tively with pneumocardiography, where there was no docu- 
mented increase in number or severity of apneas by hemoglo- 
bin range.30 Volume infusion alone, whether as RBCs or as 
albumin, was associated with similar reductions in apnea rate. 
This is consistent with observations of Bell et al of a decrease 
in the rate of apnea associated with transfusion, which did not 
translate into a signiﬁcant reduction in the numbers of infants 
with apnea.21

minimizing sampling loss, using erythropoietin, or using sim- 
ple transfusion guidelines.31 Enthusiasm for early interven- 
tion with erythropoietin32 has been tempered both by safety 
concerns33 and disappointing results from clinical trials.34 
Many RBC transfusion guidelines have suggested 
downward revisions, but the safety or potential beneﬁts of 
either the upper or lower hemoglobin limits recommended 
have not been adequately tested. Our study incorporated 
transfusion thresholds that fall within then-current clinical 
practice boundaries and guidelines.6 Controversy arose from 
the ARDS NET trial, from suggestions that the chosen 
interventions were beyond the boundary of clinical prac- 
tice.35,36 In this trial, we incorporated a comparison of algo- 
rithms, which, while within clinical practice boundaries, were 
expected to create a separation in mean hemoglobin between 
groups. We decided to allow additional “clinically driven” 
RBC transfusions in speciﬁc situations. We recognized that 
this clinical judgment might be differentially applied; in fact, 
these “clinical” transfusions were more frequent in the lower 
hemoglobin arm. However, there was no way to achieve a 
pragmatic trial without, for example, enabling surgeons and 
anesthetists to transfuse for “clinical reasons.” Although the 
contrast between high and low groups was slightly less than 
that achieved in adults in the TRICC trial (107 versus 85)8 or 
in Bell’s study,21 this present study achieved a likely physio- 
logically important difference in hemoglobin between groups 
throughout much of the hospital stay. This difference was 
especially evident in the ﬁrst 2 weeks of life. This trial could 
not be powered to detect differences in rates of RBC trans- 
fusion-related infections. However, transfusion frequency was 
taken as a proxy for this outcome, and this was marginally 
reduced in the low threshold group. Rates of all bacterial 
culture–proven infections were similar in the two groups 
(Table VII). 
The present ﬁndings provide evidence that transfusion 
thresholds in ELBW infants can be moved downward by at 
least 10 g/L, without incurring a clinically important increase 
in the risk of death or major neonatal morbidity. Further 
studies will be required to clarify residual concerns about 
secondary outcomes.
