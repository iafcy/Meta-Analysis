Red blood cell transfusion is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). 
However, observational data suggest that this practice may be associated with worse 
clinical outcomes and data from clinical trials are lacking in this population. We conducted 
a prospective multicenter randomized pilot trial in which 45 patients with AMI and a 
hematocrit level <30% were randomized to a liberal (transfuse when hematocrit <30% to 
maintain 30% to 33%) or a conservative (transfuse when hematocrit <24% to maintain 
24% to 27%) transfusion strategy. Baseline hematocrit was similar in those in the liberal 
and conservative arms (26.9% vs 27.5%, p (cid:1) 0.4). Average daily hematocrits were 30.6% in 
the liberal arm and 27.9% in the conservative arm, a difference of 2.7% (p <0.001). More 
patients in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm were transfused (100% vs 54%, 
p <0.001) and the average number of units transfused per patient tended to be higher in the 
liberal arm than in the conservative arm (2.5 vs 1.6, p (cid:1) 0.07). The primary clinical safety 
measurement of in-hospital death, recurrent MI, or new or worsening congestive heart 
failure occurred in 8 patients in the liberal arm and 3 in the conservative arm (38% vs 13%, 
p (cid:1) 0.046). In conclusion, compared to a conservative transfusion strategy, treating anemic 
patients with AMI according to a liberal transfusion strategy results in more patients 
receiving transfusions and higher hematocrit levels. However, this may be associated with 
worse clinical outcomes. A large-scale deﬁnitive trial addressing this issue is urgently 
required. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2011;108:1108 –1111) 
In patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes 
(ACS) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common yet 
highly variable practice with uncertain beneﬁt.1–5 We con- 
ducted a randomized pilot trial in which anemic patients 
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly as- 
signed to a traditional liberal transfusion strategy or a more 
conservative transfusion strategy. The purpose of this study 
was to assess the effect of this randomization scheme on 
RBC usage rates, hematocrit levels, and clinical safety in a 
preliminary manner and thus to inform the design of a 
deﬁnitive large-scale trial. 

This was a prospective multicenter parallel-group random- 
ized pilot trial to compare 2 RBC transfusion strategies in 
anemic patients with AMI. Patients were randomly assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups by the coordinating center 
using consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. Blinding of 
treatment assignment was not feasible.

Center with AMI from May 2003 through October 2009 were 
considered for enrollment. AMI was deﬁned as ischemic-type 
chest discomfort lasting (cid:1)30 minutes and associated with 
a creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) or cardiac troponin level 
above the upper limit of normal (determined locally). We 
included patients in whom the hematocrit was (cid:2)30% within 
72 hours of symptom onset. We excluded patients for the 
following reasons: (1) noncoronary cause for clinical syn- 
drome; (2) active bleeding, deﬁned as overt blood loss accom- 
panied by a decrease in hematocrit of (cid:1)5% in the preceding 12 
hours; (3) inability or unwillingness to receive RBC transfu- 
sion; (4) RBC transfusion within 7 days of enrollment; (5) 
previous severe transfusion reaction; (6) imminent death; (7) 
decision to provide limited or comfort care; (8) age (cid:1)21 years; 
(9) pregnancy; (10) participation in another clinical trial in 
which RBC transfusion was a requirement or a component of 
a primary or secondary end point; and (11) previous partici- 
pation in the present study. 
The protocol was approved by the institutional review 
board of each participating institution. Written informed 
consent was provided by the patient or an appropriate sur- 
rogate. An independent data and safety monitoring board 
monitored the study and performed 4 interim safety analy- 
ses during the course of the study. The study was supported 
by the Cardiovascular Research Institute of the Washington 
Hospital Center and received no external funding (http:// 
www.Clinicaltrials.gov, identiﬁer NCT00126334). 
Hematocrit was measured at least daily. Patients ran- 
domized to the liberal 
transfusion strategy underwent 
RBC transfusion when their hematocrit decreased (cid:1)30% 
with the goal of maintaining a hematocrit from 30% to

New or worsening HF was deﬁned as 1 of the following 
occurring (cid:1)6 hours after randomization: cardiogenic shock 
or a physician’s decision to treat HF with an intravenous 
diuretic or intravenous vasoactive drug and evidence of 
pulmonary vascular congestion. Recurrent ischemia was 

33%. Patients randomized to the conservative transfusion 
strategy underwent RBC transfusion when their hemato- 
crit decreased (cid:1)24% with the goal of maintaining a 
hematocrit from 24% to 27%. In the 2 groups leukocyte- 
depleted packed RBCs were transfused 1 U at atime and 
hematocrit was measured again 1 hour later. Additional 
units were transfused as necessary to achieve a hemato- 
crit within the target range. If the hematocrit was (cid:2)5% 
below the target range, 2 U were transfused before the 
hematocrit was measured again. If a patient underwent a 
major surgical procedure, RBCs were subsequently trans- 
fused according to the judgment of the treating physician 
until discharge from the hospital and any such transfu- 
sions were excluded from the transfusion-related analy- 
ses (other patient outcomes were not excluded). 
Patients could receive RBC transfusion for any of the 
following reasons at the discretion of the treating physician: 
(1) active bleeding as deﬁned earlier; (2) persistent hypo- 
tension related to hypovolemia; (3) active ischemia; and (4) 
at any time it was determined that it was in a patient’s best 
interest to receive a transfusion. Once the active issue was 
resolved, transfusion was again administered according to 
the study protocol. In all cases patients were analyzed ac- 
cording to the randomization scheme (“intention to treat”). 
Transfusion-related end points included the proportion of 
patients receiving (cid:1)1 transfusion, number of transfusions 
received per patient, and average daily hematocrit. The 
primary clinical safety measurement was a composite of the 
ﬁrst occurrence of in-hospital death, recurrent MI, or new or 
worsening heart failure (HF). Each additional exploratory 
clinical end point reported below was prespeciﬁed. 
Patients were followed daily by study personnel during 
their hospitalization and contacted by telephone at 30 days 
from randomization. Events were determined by the local 
study investigator. Recurrent MI was deﬁned for nonproc- 
edure-related events as recurrent ischemic chest discomfort, 
new ischemic electrocardiographic changes, and CK-MB 
increase above the upper limit of normal and increased by 
(cid:1)50% over the previous value. For patients with percuta- 
neous coronary intervention (cid:1)24 hours previously, CK-MB 
(cid:1)3 times the upper limit of normal and increased by (cid:1)50% 
over the previous value was required. For patients with 
coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (cid:1)24 hours previ-

deﬁned as pain or discomfort considered probable or deﬁ- 
nite angina that was (cid:1)5 minutes in duration. 
The initial enrollment goal for the trial was 92 patients. 
After the fourth interim safety analysis, the data and safety 
monitoring board determined that an adequate number of 
patients had been enrolled to provide preliminary results 
with respect to transfusion-related end points and clinical 
safety. Therefore, in the face of slower-than-expected en- 
rollment, the steering committee decided to halt further 
enrollment and the study was terminated after the last en- 
rolled patient completed 30-day follow-up. 
Between-group comparisons for continuous variables 
were made using t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test and 
categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test 
or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Curves of daily hemat- 
ocrit values were compared using a mixed linear model. A 
p value (cid:1)0.05 was considered to represent statistical sig- 
niﬁcance. Because of the preliminary nature of this pilot 
study, no corrections were made for multiple comparisons. 

We enrolled 45 patients, of whom 21 were randomized to 
the liberal transfusion strategy and 24 were randomized to 
the conservative transfusion strategy (Figure 1). Mean time 
from AMI symptom onset to trial enrollment was 1.6 (cid:4) 0.5 
days. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 and 
were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. MI char- 
acteristics and therapies at time of enrollment are presented 
in Table 2. There were 18 patients (40%) with ST-segment 
elevation MI and 27 patients (60%) with non–ST-segment 
elevation MI. Percutaneous coronary intervention had been 
performed in 25 patients (56%) before enrollment. Nearly 
all patients were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy. 
Baseline hematocrit levels were similar in those random- 
ized to the liberal and conservative treatment arms (26.9 (cid:4) 
1.9% vs 27.5 (cid:4) 2.4%, p (cid:3) 0.4). After randomization the mean 
hematocrit diverged in the 2 treatment arms and this difference 
was maintained throughout the study period (Figure 2). Aver- 
age daily hematocrit levels were 30.6% in the liberal arm and 
27.9% in the conservative arm, an absolute difference of 2.7% 
(p (cid:1)0.001). More patients in the liberal arm than in the con- 
servative arm were transfused with RBCs (cid:1)1 U (100% vs 
54%, p (cid:1)0.001). Average number of units of RBCs transfused 
per patient trended higher in the liberal arm than in the con- 
servative arm (2.5 (cid:4) 1.3 vs 1.6 (cid:4) 2.0, p (cid:3) 0.07). Five patients

in the conservative arm (21%) received a transfusion despite a 
hematocrit that was above the transfusion threshold. In 4 of 
these patients transfusion was administered in the setting of 
active bleeding as allowed by the protocol. One patient in each 
group erroneously received an RBC transfusion when the he- 
matocrit was above the transfusion threshold. No transfusion 
reactions occurred. 
In-hospital follow-up was complete for all patients. Three 
patients were lost to follow-up from hospital discharge to 30 
days (2 in the liberal group and 1 in the conservative group). 
Clinical end points are presented in Table 3. The primary 
clinical safety measurement, a composite of in-hospital death, 
recurrent MI, or new or worsening HF, occurred in 8 patients 
in the liberal arm and 3 patients in the conservative arm (38% 
vs 13%, p (cid:3) 0.046). Most of this difference was accounted for 
by an increase in the number of patients with new or worsening 
HF in the liberal arm (8 vs 2 patients). Recurrent ischemia 
occurred in 1 patient in the conservative arm and none in the 
liberal arm. Coronary care unit and hospital lengths of stay 
were similar in the 2 groups. At 30 days death, recurrent MI, 
or new or worsening HF occurred in 12 patients in the liberal 
arm and 4 patients in the conservative arm (60% vs 20%, p (cid:3) 
0.02). There were 2 deaths in the conservative arm (1 because 
of probable left ventricular rupture and 1 because of sepsis) and 
1 in the liberal arm (because of progressive cardiogenic shock). 

This is the ﬁrst report of a randomized trial comparing 
different RBC transfusion strategies in patients with AMI. 
In this small pilot trial we found that the randomization 
scheme we used was able to successfully maintain signiﬁ- 
cantly different hematocrit levels at or near the target levels 













for the 2 treatment groups throughout the study period. The 
conservative transfusion strategy was associated with a 36% 
relative decrease in the number of units transfused per 
patient and a 46% relative decrease in the proportion of 
patients receiving any transfusion. Furthermore, although 
our trial was not powered to detect differences in clinical 
outcomes, a signiﬁcantly higher rate of adverse clinical 
outcomes—largely related to HF—was observed in patients 
randomized to the liberal transfusion strategy. 
Theoretically, RBC transfusion might beneﬁt patients 
with ACS by increasing oxygen delivery to ischemic myo- 
cardium but might be harmful by leading to transfusion 
reactions, transmission of diseases, circulatory overload, 
acute lung injury, and/or immunosuppression.6 Previous 
studies of the role of RBC transfusion speciﬁcally in pa- 
tients with ACS are observational and have shown conﬂict- 
ing results. Wu et al5 found that RBC transfusion in Medi- 
care beneﬁciaries with AMI was associated with a lower 
short-term mortality if the admission hematocrit was 30% 
and possibly (cid:2)33%. In contrast, Rao et al2 reported that 
RBC transfusion was associated with a higher 30-day mor- 
tality rate when administered to patients with ACS and a 
nadir hematocrit of (cid:1)25%. Yang et al1 reported a similar 
increase in mortality associated with RBC transfusion in 
patients with ACS enrolled in a large prospective registry. 
To date randomized controlled trials in patients with 
ACS have been lacking. The Transfusion Requirements in 
Critical Care (TRICC) trial compared a restrictive RBC 
transfusion strategy (target hemoglobin 7.0 to 9.0 g/dl) to a 
liberal transfusion strategy (target hemoglobin 10.0 to 12.0 
g/dl) in 838 anemic patients admitted to general intensive 
care units. Thirty-day mortality was similar in the 2 groups 
despite a 54% decrease in RBC transfusions in the restric- 
tive strategy group.7 In the subgroup with cardiovascular 
disease there was no signiﬁcant difference in 30-day mor- 
tality. Results were not reported for patients with ACS.8 The 
Functional Outcomes in Cardiovascular Patients Undergo- 
ing Surgical Hip Fracture Repair (FOCUS) investigators 
randomly assigned 2,016 high-risk elderly patients who 
were undergoing hip surgery to a liberal transfusion strategy 
(transfusion for hemoglobin (cid:1)10 g/dl) or a symptom-driven 
transfusion strategy (transfusion for symptoms of anemia or 
if hemoglobin decreased to (cid:1)8 g/dl).9 Neither the primary 
functional end point nor the secondary cardiovascular end 
points were signiﬁcantly different between treatment groups. The 
Transfusion Requirement After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) trial 
randomized 502 patients undergoing cardiac surgery to 
transfusion triggers identical to those used in our study. The 
restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy resulted in non- 
inferior rates of the combined outcome of 30-day mortality 
and severe morbidity.6 
Our ﬁndings in patients with AMI, although clearly pre- 
liminary in nature, are in general agreement with these 
previous randomized trials in other patient populations in 
that we did not observe any signal of clinical harm in those 
patients randomized to a conservative transfusion strategy. 
Despite the small number of patients enrolled, the signiﬁ- 
cantly lower rate of the primary clinical end point in the 
conservative transfusion group— driven by a decrease in HF 
events—is plausible because of the substantial volume load 
associated with RBC transfusion. It is reassuring that no 
patient in this group developed a recurrent MI and only 1 
had recurrent ischemia. 
Certain important limitations of our study must be ac- 
knowledged. First, despite the randomized design, there was 
imbalance between the randomized groups in some speciﬁc 
clinical characteristics. Second, a large proportion of pa- 
tients in the 2 treatment arms underwent a revascularization 
procedure during their hospital stay. Risk of recurrent isch- 
emia associated with a conservative RBC transfusion strat- 
egy might be greater in an AMI population treated with a 
less aggressive approach to revascularization. Third, the 
small number of patients enrolled in this study represents a 
minority of all patients with AMI admitted to the partici- 
pating institutions during the time the study was ongoing. 
However, we believe our patients are representative of those 
patients with AMI and lower hematocrit values in whom 
RBC transfusion is often considered a therapeutic adjunct.
