Objectives: In children with severe sepsis or septic shock, the 
optimal red blood cell transfusion threshold is unknown. We ana- 
lyzed the subgroup of patients with sepsis and transfusion require- 
ments in a pediatric intensive care unit study to determine the impact 
of a restrictive vs. liberal transfusion strategy on clinical outcome. 
Design: Subgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter, ran- 

Setting: Multicenter pediatric critical care units. 
Patients: Stabilized critically ill children (mean systemic arterial 
pressure >2 SD below normal mean for age and cardiovascular support 
not increased for at least 2 hrs before enrollment) with a hemoglobin 
<9.5 g/dL within 7 days after pediatric critical care unit admission. 
Interventions: One hundred thirty-seven stabilized critically ill 
children with sepsis were randomized to receive red blood cell 
transfusion if their hemoglobin decreased to either <7.0 g/dL 
(restrictive group) or 9.5 g/dL (liberal group). 
Measurements and Main Results: In the restrictive group (69 
patients), 30 patients did not receive any red blood cell transfusion, 
whereas only one patient in the liberal group (68 patients) never 
underwent transfusion (p < .01). No clinically signiﬁcant differences 
were found for the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ 
dysfunction syndrome (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p (cid:1) .97), for pediatric 
critical care unit length of stay (p (cid:1) .74), or for pediatric critical care 
unit mortality (p (cid:1) .44) in the restrictive vs. liberal group. 
Conclusions: In this subgroup analysis of children with stable 
sepsis, we found no evidence that a restrictive red cell transfusion 
strategy, as compared to a liberal one, increased the rate of new 
or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Further- 
more, a restrictive transfusion threshold signiﬁcantly reduced 
exposure to blood products. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin 
level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe stabilized for children with sepsis, 
but further studies are required to support this recommendation.

their cardiac output and hemoglobin 
level (5). 
It is frequently stated by intensivists 
that critically ill patients with sepsis re- 
quire a higher hemoglobin level. In two 
surveys (6, 7) addressing this issue, pedi- 
atric intensivists replied that they prefer 
to maintain a high hemoglobin concen- 
tration in children with sepsis requiring 
intensive care and that sepsis would 
prompt them to administer red blood cell 
(RBC) transfusions at a higher hemoglo- 
bin threshold. In a landmark randomized 
clinical trial, Rivers et al (5) studied the 
efﬁcacy of goal-directed therapy in adults 
with severe sepsis before they were stabi- 
lized and reported an improved outcome 
if the central venous oxygen saturation 
was maintained at (cid:1)70% in the ﬁrst 6 hrs 
after presentation; RBC transfusions were 
among the proposed means to reach a 
central venous oxygen saturation of 70%. 
The 2008 guidelines from the Surviv- 
ing Sepsis Campaign recommend that 
adults with sepsis with low venous oxy- 
gen saturation during the ﬁrst 6 hrs of 
treatment should undergo transfusion to 
target a hematocrit (cid:1)30%. Once tissue 
hypoperfusion is resolved, the guidelines 
propose that the hemoglobin level be 
maintained between 7.0 and 9.0 g/dL; 
RBC transfusion is recommended if the 
hemoglobin decreases to (cid:2)7.0 g/dL 
(8, 9). The previous version of the Sur- 
viving Sepsis guidelines in 2004 (10) rec- 
ommended that the hemoglobin concen- 
tration be kept within the normal range 
for age in children with severe sepsis and 
septic shock ((cid:1)10 g/dL); no speciﬁc rec- 
ommendation was made for children in 
the more recently published guidelines 
(8). There is almost no evidence-based 
data on which to base recommendations 
regarding the optimal hemoglobin level 
for critically ill children with severe sep- 
sis (10). 
In 2007, Lacroix et al (11) published a 
large randomized controlled trial com- 
paring a transfusion threshold of 7.0 g/dL 
and 9.5 g/dL in stabilized critically ill 
children and provided evidence that the 
lower threshold of 7.0 g/dL was safe in 
this patient population. In the present 
subgroup analysis, we compare the effect 
of restrictive and liberal transfusion strat- 
egies on multiple organ dysfunction and 

adverse outcome in critically ill stabilized 
children with sepsis or septic shock. 

Protocol. A detailed description of the 
transfusion requirements in pediatric inten- 
sive care units (TRIPICU) results was previ- 
ously reported (11). Brieﬂy, the TRIPICU study 
enrolled stabilized critically ill children from 
19 tertiary care pediatric intensive care units 
(PICUs) from four countries. Institutional re- 
view boards approved the study protocol, and 
parental consent was obtained. The condition 
of patients was considered stable if the mean 
systemic arterial pressure was not (cid:2)2 SD below 
the normal mean for age and if cardiovascular 
support (ﬂuid, vasoactive, and inotropic 
drugs) had not been increased for at least 2 hrs 
before enrollment. Once stabilized, children 
aged between 3 days and 14 yrs, with at least 
one hemoglobin concentration (cid:2)9.5 g/dL 
within the ﬁrst 7 days after PICU admission, 
were considered for inclusion. TRIPICU study 
exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1. 
Participants were randomly allocated to 
restrictive or liberal treatment arms. In the 
restrictive group, the transfusion threshold 
was hemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL, with a target 
range after transfusion between 8.5 and 9.5 
g/dL; in the liberal group, the threshold was 
9.5 g/dL, with a target range of 11.0 to 12.0 
g/dL. Only pre-storage leukocyte-reduced al- 
logeneic RBC units were used. Transfusion 
strategies were applied until intensive care 
unit discharge, 28 days after randomization, 
or until the time of death, whichever came 
ﬁrst. Temporary suspensions from the pro- 
tocol were allowed during active blood loss, 
emergency surgery, severe hypoxemia, or 
hemodynamic instability. 
The primary outcome was the proportion 
of patients with development of or progression 
of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes 
(MODS) after randomization. MODS was de- 
ﬁned by Proulx et al (1), and new or progres- 
sive MODS was deﬁned by Lacroix et al (11). 
New MODS was considered if a patient with no 
organ dysfunction or one organ dysfunction at 
randomization developed two or more organs 
during the study. Progressive MODS was con- 
sidered if a patient who already had MODS 
(dysfunction of at least two organs) at ran- 
domization had dysfunction of at least one 
other organ during the study. The secondary 
outcomes included nosocomial 
infections 
(12), mortality, duration of mechanical venti- 
lation, and PICU length of stay. 
Assignment. Randomization for the TRIPICU 
trial was centralized, with assignment data 
posted on the Internet. Patients were assigned 
to the study groups in blocks of two or four 
that were randomly distributed and stratiﬁed 
according to center and three age groups (28 
days or younger, 29 to 364 days, and older 
than 364 days). Physicians, nurses, and re- 
search staff were unaware of the block ran- 
domization strategy. 

Figure 1. Enrollment and outcomes. Some patients had more than one exclusion criterion. In addition 
to the causes listed for exclusion, other causes were a postconception age of less than 40 wks (69 
patients), severe thrombocytopenia (68), hypoxemia (65), a decision to withhold or withdraw critical 
care (59), predicted survival of (cid:2)24 hrs (54), previous enrollment in the study (33), brain death (25), 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (22), hemoﬁltration (21), blood exchange transfusion (20), 
plasmapheresis (17), an inability to receive blood products (14), and pregnancy (1). 
Blinding Procedures. The TRIPICU study 
was not blinded because this was not feasible. 
Clinical staff and parents were aware of the 
assignments to study groups (presence of 
blood bag at the bedside, increase in hemoglo- 
bin level after transfusion), but the statistician 
and members of the data and safety monitor- 
ing committee were unaware of the assign- 
ments. 
Subgroup Study. The present study is a 
subgroup analysis of septic patients enrolled 
in the TRIPICU study. This subgroup analysis 
was planned before the TRIPICU study was 
started. Expected direction (noninferiority) of 
results was stated before this subgroup analy- 
sis began. 
Systemic inﬂammatory response syn- 
drome (SIRS) was deﬁned by the presence of 
at least two of the following criteria: (1) tem- 
perature (cid:1)38°C rectal or (cid:2)36°C rectal; (2) 
heart rate (cid:1)2 SD for age; (3) tachypnea with a 
respiratory rate (cid:1)2 SD for age; and (4) white 
blood cell count (cid:1)12 (cid:3) 109/L ((cid:1)12,000 cells/ 
mm3) or (cid:2)4 (cid:3) 109/L ((cid:2)4,000 cells/mm3) or 
(cid:1)10% immature neutrophils. Sepsis was de- 
ﬁned as a systemic inﬂammatory response 
syndrome caused by an infection (positive cul- 
ture from any site or clinical evidence of in- 
fection or both). Severe sepsis was deﬁned as 
sepsis with Glasgow score (cid:2)15, serum lactate 
level above normal, or low urine output ((cid:2)1 
mL/kg/hr for (cid:1)2 hrs). Septic shock was de- 
ﬁned as severe sepsis with hypotension (blood 
pressure (cid:2)2 SD for age) or need for inotropic 
or vasopressor agents (1, 13). Sepsis, severe 
sepsis, and septic shock are deﬁned according 
to Bone et al (13); categories are mutually 
exclusive and the most severe was attributed 
to each patient. 
Statistical Analysis. Continuous variables 
were compared using Student t test or Wil- 
coxon rank sum test; categorical variables 
were analyzed using chi-square testing. Base- 
line characteristics were compared using uni- 
variate descriptive statistics. Descriptive sta- 
tistics are reported as mean (cid:4) SD or as 
numbers and proportions. 
It was estimated that at least 626 patients 
would be required to complete the original 
TRIPICU study to test a noninferiority hypoth- 
esis (p (cid:2) .05; power of 0.9; margin of safety, 
higher 95% CI of absolute risk reduction of 
10%). The present subgroup analysis involved 
137 septic patients and the statistical analyses 
tested noninferiority in a manner similar to 
that in the original study (11). Statistical anal- 
ysis of the primary outcome measure was con- 
ducted using an intent-to-treat approach; for 
this analysis, we calculated 95% conﬁdence 
intervals around the absolute risk reduction in 
the proportion of patients with new or pro- 
gressive MODS. 
All secondary analyses were conducted us- 
ing an intent-to-treat approach. We compared 
daily pediatric logistic organ dysfunction 
scores, using the worst scores after baseline, 
and the total number of organ dysfunctions 
per patient. We also compared 28-day and hos- 
pital all-cause mortality, nosocomial 
infec- 
tions, transfusion reactions, duration of me- 
chanical ventilation, and PICU and hospital 
length of stay. To determine whether a restric- 
tive transfusion strategy decreased exposure to 
RBCs, we compared the total number of trans- 

fusions per patient and the proportion of pa- 
tients who did not receive RBC transfusions in 
the two groups. 
Differences were considered statistically 
signiﬁcant when a two-sided (cid:5) level was 
(cid:2)0.05. No adjustments were made for multi- 
ple comparisons. Data were analyzed by a bio- 
statistician (T.D.) with SAS software (version 
9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 

Patients at Admission and at Ran- 
domization. There were 137 septic pa- 
tients enrolled from 19 sites and four 
countries in the septic patients subgroup, 
representing 21.5% of all TRIPICU pa- 
tients: 69 were randomized to the restric- 
tive group and 68 were randomized to the 
liberal group (Fig. 1). Table 1 describes 
patient characteristics on PICU admis- 
sion. Both groups were similar with re- 
gard to demographic data, severity of (as 
measured by the Pediatric Risk of Mortal- 
ity score) (14) and proportion requiring 
mechanical ventilation. There were fewer 
patients with septic shock in the restric- 
tive compared to the liberal group (13 
[19%] vs. 21 [31%]); this difference was 
not statistically signiﬁcant (p (cid:6) .32). Ta- 
ble 2 describes patient characteristics at 
randomization, which occurred 2.3 (cid:4) 1.7 
days after entry into PICU. Severity of 
illness and need for mechanical ventila- 
tion were similar in both groups. 
Intervention. The baseline hemoglo- 
bin concentration at randomization was 
7.9 (cid:4) 1.0 in the restrictive group and 
7.8 (cid:4) 0.9 g/dL in the liberal group. Time 
between randomization and ﬁrst transfu- 
sion was 1.3 (cid:4) 2.1 days in the restrictive 
group vs. 0.2 (cid:4) 0.4 days in the liberal 
group (p (cid:2) .001) (Table 3). As expected, 
the hemoglobin level before the ﬁrst 
transfusion was signiﬁcantly lower in the 
restrictive group (6.6 (cid:4) 0.5 vs. 7.9 (cid:4) 0.9 
g/dL; p (cid:2) .01), as well as the lowest he- 
moglobin level after randomization 
(8.3 (cid:4) 1.1 vs. 10.6 (cid:4) 1.7 g/dL; p (cid:2) .01). 
Overall, in the restrictive group, 30 
patients (44%) did not receive any RBC 
transfusion, whereas only one patient 
(1%) in the liberal group did not undergo 
transfusion (p (cid:2) .01). The median vol- 
ume transfused was 7.6 vs. 15.7 mL/kg, 
respectively (p (cid:2) .01). 
Storage time of the transfused RBC 
units was similar in both the liberal and 
restrictive groups (14.3 (cid:4) 8.3 days vs. 
15.6 (cid:4) 8.6 days, respectively). Eleven pa- 
tients in the restrictive and six in the 
liberal group (p (cid:6) .96) were temporarily 
suspended from the transfusion protocol.

Length of suspension in the restrictive 
group and liberal group was 6.7 (cid:4) 7.7 
and 2.3 (cid:4) 2.0 days, respectively. Cointer- 
ventions, including requirement for vaso- 
active drugs (proportion of patients re- 
ceiving at 
and 
fresh-frozen plasma, 
administration of 
platelets, and albumin were similar in 
both groups. 


Thirteen patients in the restrictive 
group and 13 in the liberal group had 
new or progressive MODS after random- 
ization (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p (cid:6) .97) (Ta- 
ble 4). In this subgroup analysis, the ab- 
solute risk reduction was 0.3%, whereas 
it was 0.4% in the original study; the 95% 
conﬁdence interval ((cid:7)12.8% to (cid:8)13.4%) 
was outside the 10% margin of safety 
agreed on for the original study. There 
were no differences among the 17 pa- 
tients who were temporarily suspended 
from the transfusion protocol, with the 
primary outcome being present in eight 
(72%) vs. ﬁve (67%) patients (p (cid:6) .56). 

There were no clinically signiﬁcant 
differences in any of the measures of or- 
gan dysfunction analyzed (Table 4), in- 
cluding oxygenation markers and dura- 
tion of mechanical ventilation. There 
were 12 cases (17%) of nosocomial infec- 
tions in the restrictive group compared to 
23 (34%) in the liberal group (p (cid:6) .02). 
There were no differences in the total 
PICU length of stay (13.2 (cid:4) 8.1 vs. 13.4 (cid:4) 
8.4 days; p (cid:6) .74) and in the PICU length 
of stay after randomization (7.5 (cid:4) 6.3 vs. 
7.1 (cid:4) 6.2 days; p (cid:6) .74). There were ﬁve 
deaths in the restrictive group and two in 
the liberal group in the PICU (p (cid:6) .44). 
Two additional patients died in the re- 
strictive group after PICU discharge but 
within 28 days after randomization (p (cid:6) 
.08). 

In this subgroup analysis of septic pa- 
tients enrolled in the TRIPICU trial, an 
equal number of patients had new or pro- 
gressive MODS in both transfusion strat- 
egy groups. Furthermore, there were no 
meaningful differences for any of the sec- 
ondary outcomes analyzed. These results 
suggest that a restrictive transfusion 
threshold of 7.0 g/dL may be safe for 
hemodynamically stabilized septic pa- 
tients admitted to the PICU, and that the 
outcome for this particular subgroup of 
patients was similar to that of other pa- 
tients in the TRIPICU trial. 
In the Surviving Sepsis campaign pub- 
lished in 2008, the recommended trans- 
fusion strategy for septic adult patients 
with low central venous oxygen satura- 
tion, who are considered to have tissue 
hypoperfusion and therefore are to be un- 
stable, is to maintain a hematocrit level 
(cid:1)30%; once stabilized, the recom- 
mended target hemoglobin level is 7.0 – 
9.0 g/dL. The previous version of Surviv-

aTo be considered on dopamine, the patient had to receive (cid:1)5 (cid:9)g/kg/min. Results are expressed as 

ing Sepsis published in 2004 stated that 
“the optimal hemoglobin for a critically 
ill child with severe sepsis is not known” 
and made no recommendations regard- 
ing the triggers (10). In the 2008 version 
of these guidelines, it is stated that “it is 
still unclear whether a lower transfusion 
trigger is safe or appropriate during the 
initial resuscitation of children with sep- 
tic shock” and again made no recommen- 
dations for a hemoglobin threshold for 
RBC transfusion (8). In the present study, 
children with sepsis were evaluated once 
they were considered stabilized. The lat- 
ter deﬁnition required that patients have 
a mean systemic arterial pressure not (cid:2)2 
SD below the normal mean for age and no 
increase in any cardiovascular treatment 
(ﬂuids, vasoactive, and inotropic drugs) 
for at least 2 hrs before enrollment. Al- 
though this cohort of patients with sepsis 
did not include the most severely ill chil- 
dren with sepsis because TRIPICU exclu- 
sion criteria did not allow for their inclu- 
sion if unstable, it nonetheless suggests 
that a lower transfusion threshold may be 
safe for children with sepsis once stabi- 
lized (after the initial resuscitation 
phase). In addition, we found that a re- 
strictive strategy resulted in a two-fold 
reduction in the number of septic pa- 
tients who received a transfusion, as well 
as a two-fold reduction in the median 
volume and number of RBC transfusions, 
resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction in ex- 
posure to blood products. 
The treatment of septic patients re- 
quires optimization of oxygen delivery 
and utilization by tissues to minimize 
cellular dysfunction. RBC transfusion is 
administered to increase the oxygen 
content of arterial blood and oxygen 
delivery to tissues; however, increasing 
global oxygen delivery does not always 
improve oxygen consumption (15–17). In 
sepsis and septic shock, it is well estab- 
lished that microcirculatory dysfunction 
and mitochondrial depression occur de- 
spite adequate global oxygen delivery, re- 
sulting in regional hypoxia and oxygen 
extraction deﬁcit. Microcirculatory dys- 
function is characterized by heteroge- 
neous abnormalities in blood ﬂow, with 
some capillaries being underperfused, 
whereas others have normal to abnor- 
mally high blood ﬂow. Sakr et al (18) 
have demonstrated that patients with 
septic shock had abnormal small vessel 
perfusion initially, which improved over 
time only in survivors. Similarly, Trze- 
ciak et al (19) have shown that early mi- 
crocirculatory perfusion indices in severe

sepsis and septic shock are more mark- 
edly impaired in nonsurvivors compared 
to survivors and are associated with in- 
creasing severity of global cardiovascular 
dysfunction. In addition, Brealey et al 
(20) showed that mitochondrial dysfunc- 
tion is correlated with a less favorable 
outcome in sepsis. Both microcirculatory 
anomalies and mitochondrial dysfunction 
lead to the inability to increase oxygen 
consumption, which cannot be immedi- 
ately improved with RBC transfusion be- 
cause of the changes that occur during 
the storage process. Stored RBC units 
have decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate 
and S-nitrosohemoglobin levels, which 
cause abnormal vasodilatory responses to 
hypoxemia and mismatch between local 
oxygen delivery through small vessels 
and O2 requirements in tissues (21, 22). 
Stored RBCs are less deformable (23), 
contain more extracellular ubiquitin (24) 
and advanced glycation end products 
(25), express more phosphatidylserine 
(26), and induce more cytokine produc- 
tion (27) and secretory phospholipase A2 
(28). All these changes are known to have 
immunologic or pro-coagulant proper- 
ties, which may further contribute to the 
inability of RBC transfusion to rapidly 
increase tissue oxygen consumption in 
critically ill patients. 
Besides uncertainty with regard to im- 
provement of oxygen consumption, there 
are several other issues associated with 
transfusion of any blood product that re- 
quire consideration. The risks associated 

with RBC transfusion are well established 
and include acute transfusion reactions 
(29, 30) and infectious disease transmis- 
sion (31); some studies even suggesting 
an increased incidence rate of MODS, 
morbidity, and mortality (32–34). In this 
study, we found that a restrictive trans- 
fusion strategy resulted in a two-fold re- 
duction in both the number of patients 
undergoing transfusion and the median 
volume transfused. Almost all patients 
(99%) in the liberal group received a 
transfusion compared to only 56% of 
those in the restrictive strategy group. 
Thus, a restrictive transfusion strategy 
allowed a signiﬁcant reduction in RBC 
transfusion and its inherent risks without 
increasing the rate of new or progressive 
MODS, mortality, or any other MODS de- 
scriptor. 
Interestingly, our data also showed 
that patients in the liberal group had 
signiﬁcantly more nosocomial infections 
than those in the restrictive group (23 vs. 
12 cases; p (cid:6) .02). Whereas other studies 
have show that RBC transfusions are as- 
sociated with increased nosocomial infec- 
tions (33, 35, 36), there was only a trend 
in the initial TRIPICU study. This might 
be explained by a combined effect of 
transfusions and septic state, a hypothe- 
sis supported by data suggesting that pre- 
existing infections and RBC transfusions 
are independently associated with noso- 
comial 
infections (37). One hypothesis 
could be that sepsis induces an immuno- 
modulation that renders the patient more 
prone to contract transfusion-associated 
nosocomial infections. 
Certain limitations in our study must 
be recognized. First, it could be argued 
that the patients included in TRIPICU 
were stabilized and therefore did not have 
the most severe cases of sepsis and septic 
shock, because patients had to have a 
mean systemic arterial pressure (cid:1)2 SD 
below the normal mean for age and no 
increase in cardiovascular support (ﬂuid, 
vasoactive, and inotropic drugs) for at 
least 2 hrs before enrollment. However, 
our cohort of septic patients was none- 
theless quite ill, and half of them re- 
quired inotropic or vasopressor support 
or both, and 90% had respiratory dys- 
function. Second, because the TRIPICU 
trial protocol was written in 2000, the 
deﬁnitions of sepsis, severe sepsis, and 
septic shock used were based on the 1992 
deﬁnitions of the American College of 
Chest Physicians (13), which were 
adapted for the pediatric population by 
Proulx et al (1), and not the more recent 
2001 deﬁnitions (38). Nevertheless, the 
two sets of deﬁnitions are quite similar, 
because the 2001 deﬁnitions use the def- 
inition for organ dysfunctions in children 
cited by Proulx et al. Third, the deaths 
during PICU stay and at 28 days were not 
signiﬁcantly different between both 
groups, but these results should be inter- 
preted cautiously because the number of 
deaths was low. Nevertheless, no other 
secondary outcome measuring morbidity 

was different between the two groups, 
and this further supports the ﬁndings 
with regard to mortality. Fourth, the in- 
vestigators and members of the Canadian 
Critical Care Trials Group had a priori 
considered the following as a statistically 
signiﬁcant result for the original TRI- 
PICU noninferiority trial: a higher 95% 
conﬁdence interval for the absolute risk 
reduction that is lower than a 10% mar- 
gin of safety when comparing the propor- 
tion of patients with new or progressive 
MODS in the restrictive and liberal 
group. The 95% conﬁdence interval of 
(cid:7)12.8% does not conﬁrm a noninferior- 
ity hypothesis, which is likely attributable 
to the fact that this subgroup analysis is 
underpowered to attain statistical signif- 
icance. Finally, the most important limi- 
tations of our study are the pitfalls inher- 
ent 
to any subgroup analysis that 
preclude the possibility of generating de- 
ﬁnitive conclusions and, at best, allow for 
hypothesis generation only (39). Hence, 
no deﬁnitive recommendations regarding 
transfusion thresholds in stabilized chil- 
dren with sepsis can be made. It is none- 
theless striking that the frequency of the 
primary outcome in the two transfusion 
groups was similar. 
To our knowledge, there are no other 
studies that have prospectively evaluated 
the safety of a restrictive transfusion 
strategy in septic patients. Furthermore, 
it has been shown that there are signiﬁ- 
cant variations in transfusion practice 
patterns among pediatric critical care 
practitioners with respect to the thresh- 
old hemoglobin concentration for RBC 
transfusion in critically ill septic patients 
(6, 33). Therefore, the results reported in 
this article are important, even though it 
is a subgroup analysis. Our results are 
certainly generalizable because the pop- 
ulation is representative of North Ameri- 
can and European centers. Furthermore, 
the trial was pragmatic, allowing for sus- 
pension from the study protocol for unsta- 
ble patients and therefore reﬂecting real- 
life clinical situations of critically ill 
patients. The strength of these ﬁndings is 
enhanced by the excellent adherence to the 
research protocol (nearly 99% of patients 
in the TRIPICU study met the 80% adher- 
ence criterion), by the fact that no patient 
was lost to follow-up, and by the remark- 
able similarity of the results reported in the 
overall TRIPICU study and two other sub- 
group analyses of cardiac surgery (40) and 
general surgery patients (41). 


In conclusion, in this subgroup anal- 
ysis of children with stable sepsis, we 
found no evidence that a restrictive red 
cell transfusion strategy, as compared to 
a liberal one, increased the rate of new or 
progressive MODS. Furthermore, a re- 
strictive transfusion threshold signiﬁ- 
cantly reduced exposure to blood prod- 
ucts. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin 
level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe for children 
with stabilized sepsis, but further studies 
are required to support this recommen- 
dation.
