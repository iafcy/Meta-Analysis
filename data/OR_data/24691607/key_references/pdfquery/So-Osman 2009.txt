Objective In elective orthopaedic hip- and knee replacement surgery patients, we 
studied the effect of implementation of a uniform transfusion policy on RBC usage. 
Study Design and Methods A randomized, controlled study. A new uniform, 
restrictive transfusion policy was compared with standard care, which varied 
among the three participating hospitals. Only prestorage leucocyte-depleted RBC(s) 
were used. Primary end-point was RBC usage, related to length of hospital stay. 
Secondary end-points were Hb levels, mobilization delay and postoperative 
complications. 
Results Six hundred and three patients were evaluated. Adherence to the protocol 
was over 95%. Overall mean RBC usage was 0Æ78 U ⁄ patient in the new policy group 
and 0Æ86 U ⁄ patient in the standard care policy group (mean difference 0Æ08;95% CI 
[)0Æ3; 0Æ2]; P = 0Æ53). In two hospitals, the new transfusion policy resulted in a RBC 
reduction of 30% (0Æ58U RBC ⁄ patient) (P = 0Æ17) and 41% (0Æ29 U RBC ⁄ patient) 
(P = 0Æ05) respectively. In the third hospital, however, RBC usage increased by 39% 
(0Æ31 U RBC ⁄ patient) (P = 0Æ02) with the new policy, due to a more restrictive stan- 
dard care policy in that hospital. Length of hospital stay was not inﬂuenced by 
either policy. 
Conclusions Implementation of a uniform transfusion protocol for elective lower 
joint arthroplasty patients is feasible, but does not always lead to a RBC reduction. 
Length of hospital stay was not affected.

uniform use of allogeneic RBC transfusions. In itself, one of 
the tools to accomplish a reduction in allogeneic RBC trans- 
fusions is a standardized protocol for the use of a restrictive 
transfusion trigger. Studies on the use of such a protocol in 
(orthopaedic hip fracture) surgery report an allogeneic RBC 
reduction between 40 and 80%, depending on the type of 
restriction used [4–6]. In elective orthopaedic surgery, a ran- 
domized study in which different transfusion trigger proto- 
cols are compared has never been performed. Additionally, 
except for studies in paediatric and neonatal patients, all 
previous studies that compared different transfusion trig- 
gers used non-leucocyte-depleted RBC units [4,5,7]. We 
only used prestorage leucocyte-depleted (LD) RBC(s) and

conducted a randomized controlled trial among elective 
orthopaedic surgery patients in three Dutch hospitals to 
investigate the effect of a new, restrictive transfusion proto- 
col compared with the standard care on the magnitude of 
reduction in RBC transfusions and its effects on length of 
hospital stay (LOHS), postoperative complications and reha- 
bilitation. 


Primary objective was to investigate whether or not a 
reduction of RBC usage was associated with a prolonged 
hospital stay. 
Primary outcome was RBC usage. With the new transfu- 
sion policy, we aimed at a reduction of 40% in RBC use 
without increasing hospital stay. Secondary end-points 
were: postoperative Hb values (g ⁄ dl) at day +1, day +4 and 
day +14, mobilization delay (days) and postoperative com- 
plication rate. 
Inclusion criteria 
All patients of 18 years and older scheduled for a primary 
or revision total hip replacement 
(THR) or total knee 
replacement (TKR) surgery of three Dutch participating 
hospitals were eligible for inclusion. 
Exclusion criteria 
Refusal of allogeneic transfusions (e.g. Jehovah’s witnesses). 

A randomized open study stratiﬁed by hospital, type of 
surgery and risk group. Eligible patients were informed 
during the preoperative intake at the orthopaedic outpa- 
tient clinic and after obtaining informed consent were 
randomly assigned to a new transfusion policy (protocol 
A) or standard care (protocol B). The new policy, which 
was risk level based and uniform among the three partic- 
ipating hospitals, is described in Table 1 and was meant 
to include the more restrictive transfusion policy. In this 
policy, age and co-morbidity were determinants for the 
used risk levels for transfusion. Three clinical risk groups 
(low, 
intermediate and high) were deﬁned: age groups 
< 50 years, 50 to 70 years and older than 70 years or 
presence of signiﬁcant co-morbidity (i.e. cardiovascular 
and pulmonary disease, and ⁄ or insulin-dependent diabe- 
tes). The standard care policies, which varied among hos- 
pitals, are described in Table 2, and were supposed to 
include the more liberal transfusion policies. Randomiza- 
tion took place as follows: all patients were stratiﬁed by 
hospital, type of surgery (primary ⁄ revision THR ⁄ TKR) and

Netherlands, our data comprise only prestorage LD- RBC(s). 
Intra-operative transfusions were guarded by the anaesthe- 
siologist and postoperative transfusions by the orthopaedic 
surgeon. Both were informed about the treatment assign- 
ment 
they were not 
involved in the co-ordination and evaluation of the study. 
The chart data were written on the Clinical Research Form 
and placed in the database by the research nurse, who had 
access to the medical records in which the study assignment 
was noted. The study investigators, however, were blinded 
for the randomization arm. Transfusion trigger deviations 
were regarded as protocol violations. The following post- 
operative complications were scored: 
ICU 
(deﬁned by the national 
stay, 


haemovigilance association), neuro-psychiatric, cardiovas- 
cular, haemorrhagic and drug-related complications, and 
death. Postoperative infections were deﬁned according to 
the CDC criteria [8]. Wound infections were scored accord- 
ing to Gaine et al. [9]. Mobilization was deﬁned according 
to the hospital protocols (hospital number 1: mobilization 
from day +2 onwards, hospitals number 2 and 3: mobiliza- 
tion from day +1 onwards) and was recorded by the ortho- 
paedic surgeon on the ward. Postoperative discharge from 
the hospital was based on physical properties of the patient: 
they had to be ambulated with a crutch and had to be able 
to walk a staircase with ease. Hospital number 2 used a 
short-stay protocol 
the most healthy and mobile 
patients. Follow up ended at the outpatient clinic 14 days 
after surgery or (in case of a hospital stay of more than 
14 days) at ﬁnal discharge. All patients provided informed 
consent and the trial was conducted according to good 
clinical practices and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study 
was approved by the Medical Ethical Committees of the 
three participating hospitals. 


The initial sample size calculation (power 0Æ90; alpha 
0Æ05) was based on pilot data of hospital number 1, from 
which a 40% RBC reduction (in terms of RBC units 
divided by the total patients in each randomization 
group) was expected by introducing the new transfusion 
policy. Since the main statistical analysis is a comparison 
of group means, the reduction for which the study was 
powered, was transformed to an absolute reduction from 
an estimated mean RBC use of 2Æ6 units (SD 2Æ4) in one 
group to a mean RBC use of 1Æ6 units (SD 2Æ4) in the 
other group. A t-test with adjustment for possibly non- 
normally distributed data needed two groups of 125 
patients to achieve 90% power for a treatment effect of 1 
RBC unit at a pooled SD of 2Æ4, while at the same time 
powering with 90% for equivalence in length of stay with 
a delta of at most 4 days between the groups. At the 
time, the study protocol was designed, a mean hospital 
stay of 10 to 12 days was usual; therefore, a prolonga- 
tion of hospital stay of more than 4 days was not 
acceptable from a clinical point of view. To adjust for 
non-evaluable patients, each of three hospitals had at 
least to randomize 100 patients. An interim analysis was 
performed after the ﬁrst 125 patients became evaluable. 
A formal stopping rule was prespeciﬁed to enable the 
trial to stop for futility as well as efﬁcacy, using a simple 
Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (alpha = 0Æ025). 
This prespeciﬁed rule also included the condition of a 
maximal prolongation of hospital stay of 4 days in the 
new policy group, which was expected to include the 
most restrictive transfusion policy: so if RBC use was

signiﬁcantly lower in the new policy group, but hospital 
stay increased by more than four days, the new transfu- 
sion policy was considered neither clinically nor econom- 
ically beneﬁcial. A much lower percentage of patients 
the 
who were actually transfused (33% in stead of 
expected 75%, which was calculated from the pilot 
study), irrespective of hospital and trial arm, resulted in 
an adjustment of the group sizes, leading to two groups 
of 300 evaluable patients. 

Analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and 
for the parametric analyses stratiﬁed by all stratiﬁcation 
factors in the design. Frequencies were described as mean 
and SD and in addition, median and interquartile range in 
case of a non-normal distribution. Analysis of laboratory 
parameters between patients and other numerical end- 
points was performed with the ANOVA-test for between- 
group comparisons and by a paired t-test (or a mixed 
model) for within-patients effects. Differences between the 
groups in the number of RBC transfusions and the total 
number of units RBC transfusions given were analyzed with 
the non-parametric Mann–Whitney test. Categorical end- 
points were tested using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s 
Exact test. LOHS and age were analyzed as a continuous 
variable. 
In case of heterogeneity between the three 
hospitals concerning the primary and secondary end- 
points, subgroup analyses by hospital will be performed. 
Regarding the primary end-point, a P-value of < 0Æ05 
was considered statistically signiﬁcant. For the analysis of 
the secondary end-points, we used a Bonferroni correction 
to adjust 
for multiple testing (signiﬁcant P-value of 
< 0Æ01). Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical 
program (version 11Æ0) for Windows (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). 


From 2001 to 2003, 713 patients were assessed for eligibil- 
ity of which 619 consecutive patients were included. 
Sixteen patients were not analyzed because of the follow- 
ing reasons: cancellation of surgery in seven, death before 
surgery in one, consent withdrawn before surgery in six 
and charts missing in two cases (Fig. 1: FLOW CHART). 
Baseline characteristics of the excluded group were com- 
parable with the analyzed group (data not shown). The 
included patients were equally assigned to the randomiza- 
tion groups within each hospital. 
Baseline characteristics between the two randomization 
groups (protocol A and protocol B) were comparable, 
except for female patients, who were represented more in 

the new policy group (P = 0Æ01) and for patients with rheu- 
matoid arthritis, who were represented more in the standard 
care group (P = 0Æ02) (Table 3). 
The baseline characteristics between hospitals were 
comparable, except for hospital number 1, the university 
medical centre, who included a signiﬁcantly higher pro- 
portion of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients (31Æ7% vs. 
9Æ2% and 3Æ3% in the other hospitals, 
respectively; 
P < 0Æ001). Also, hospital number 1 included patients 
with a lower mean age (SD) than the other hospitals 
(67Æ1 (11Æ7) vs. 71Æ1 (9Æ8) and 70Æ5 (9Æ9); P < 0Æ001). This 
age difference can be explained by the larger RA patient 
population, who are generally younger when indicated 
for joint replacement surgery. Co-morbidities such as 
hypertension, myocardial infarction, heart failure, diabe- 
tes, stroke, peripheral arterial disease and arrhythmia 
were all comparable among hospitals, as well as use of 
medication (steroids, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs 
(NSAID’s), anticoagulants etc). Autologous re-infusion by 
cell saver was used in two hospitals in a total of nine cases 
(2% of total; twice in hospital number 2 and seven times in 
hospital number 3). 

Overall RBC usage in the group with the new policy was 
0Æ78 U ⁄ patient (SD 1Æ4) and 0Æ86 U ⁄ patient (SD 1Æ6) in the 
standard care group, with an overall mean difference of 
0Æ08 (95% CI of mean difference [)0Æ3, 0Æ2]; P = 0Æ53). 
LOHS was comparable between the groups [mean difference 
of )0Æ6 days (95% CI of mean difference [)1Æ2, 0Æ5]; 
P = 0Æ21) (Table 4). 

Results of all categorical, secondary end-points were not 
signiﬁcantly different between the new policy and the stan- 
dard care policy (P > 0Æ05) (Table 4). 

Due to heterogeneity of the effects on primary outcome 
across the three hospitals (P = 0Æ008), we performed a sub- 
group-analysis by hospital. 
Primary outcome 
RBC use and the proportion of transfused patients were 
highest in hospital number 1 (Table 5). In two hospitals 
(number 1 and 2), the new policy (protocol A) was more 
restrictive than the standard care, but resulted in a non- 
signiﬁcant RBC reduction of 30% in hospital number 1 
(P = 0Æ17) and a nearly signiﬁcant reduction of 41% in 
hospital number 2 (P = 0Æ05). 
In the third hospital, 
(cid:2) 2009 The Author(s) 
Journal compilation (cid:2) 2009 International Society of Blood Transfusion, Vox Sanguinis (2010) 98, 56–64 

however, the standard care was more restrictive, which 
led to an increase of 39% in RBC usage (P = 0Æ02) and to 
an increase in the proportion of transfused patients as 
well (P = 0Æ001). The effect on RBC use differed signiﬁ- 
(test on interaction; P = 0Æ008). An 
cantly per hospital 
interaction of RBC use with risk group was found in hos- 
pital number 1: compared with the high risk group, the 
effect size (this is the difference between the new policy 
and standard care) was larger in the lowest risk group, 
namely )4Æ9 RBC(s) (95% CI [)7Æ1, )2Æ7]; P < 0Æ001) and 
)2Æ1 RBC(s) 
in the 




intermediate risk group. In hospital number 2 and 3, no 
clinical 
risk 
group was found. Within each hospital, mean duration of 
surgery and median blood loss were comparable between 
randomization groups. Total LOHS differed between hos- 
pitals because of the different hospital protocols. Hospital 
number 2 used a short-stay protocol, which resulted in 
the shortest LOHS. Due to a non-normal distribution of 
data, median values are shown, which were comparable 
within randomization groups. In all hospitals, LOHS was 
not affected by any transfusion protocol. 
Fig. 1 The ﬂowchart shows the progress of all participants in the trial, from the time they are assessed for eligibility until the end of their involvement. In 
hospital #1 and hospital #2, the new policy (protocol A) was the most restrictive policy, as expected. In hospital #3, the standard care policy (Protocol B) 
turned out to be the most restrictive policy.

Secondary outcome 
Mean postoperative Hb levels were comparable between 
hospitals and within each hospital between randomization 
groups. For hospital number 1, the mean values were: 
9Æ8 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ3) at day +1, 10Æ3 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ1) at day +4 
and 10Æ9 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ1) at day +14. For hospital number 2, 
these values were: 10Æ8 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ6), 10Æ9 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ1) 
and 11Æ8 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ3), respectively, and for hospital num- 
ber 3 these values were: 10Æ5 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ3), 10Æ3 g ⁄ dl (SD 
1Æ1) and 11Æ3 g ⁄ dl (SD 1Æ1) respectively. 
In 203 patients (33Æ7%), a postoperative complication 
was observed, which was highest in hospital number 1 
(83 ⁄ 123 = 67%). Between transfusion policies, differences 
were found in composite complications in hospital number 
2, which were slightly more represented in the standard 
care group that had the most liberal policy (n = 35 vs. 
n = 21 in the new policy group; P = 0Æ04) (Table 6). In hos- 
pital number 1, 
respiratory complications were more 
observed in the standard care group that had the most lib- 
eral transfusion policy (n = 13 vs. n = 3 in the new policy 
group; P = 0Æ008). Furthermore, delayed mobilization (i.e. 
from the standard ambulation protocol) was 
different

reported more frequent in the standard care group of hospi- 
tal number 3 (n = 18 vs. n = 8 in the new policy group; 
P = 0Æ04), which contained the most restrictive transfusion 
policy. Infections occurred in 47 (7Æ8%) of all patients, 
which were mostly urinary tract infections (24 cases); 16 
patients had wound infections, of which ﬁve were deep 
prosthetic infections. The remaining wound infections con- 
sisted of mostly superﬁcial wound infections, which 
resolved uneventful: mild, grade 2 infections (haematoma 
with or without evident inﬂammation, but no bacterial 
growth) and in two cases, more severe infections: one grade 
3 (bacterial growth with a haematoma, but no evident 
inﬂammation) and one grade 4 infection (evident inﬂam- 
mation and bacterial growth). Furthermore, one patient 
suffered from a pneumonia and in six patients, a systemic 
bacterial infection (n = 3) or a localized infection (n = 3) 
was found. One patient had two infections. Respiratory 
complications were pulmonary embolism in one, pneumo- 
nia in one, ﬁve cases of transfusion associated cardiac 
overload (TACO), three cases of respiratory insufﬁciency 
due to opiates for pain reduction, bronchospasm in COPD 
in two and shortness of breath without evident clinical sub- 
strate in nine cases. Of all complications, ICU stay of more 
than 1 day (n = 3) and transfusion reactions (n = 3) were 
negligible (< 1%). Mortality was found in three cases, one 
in each hospital, which all occurred in the groups who were 
transfused with the most liberal policies. The proportion of 
patients who had a delay in mobilization differed per hospi- 
tal, but within hospitals, delay was comparable between 
randomization groups in hospitals number 1 and 2. In hos- 
pital number 3, however, more patients (n = 18) were 
delayed in the group with the most restrictive transfusion 
policy compared with the patients in the group transfused 
with the most liberal policy (OR 2Æ4 (95% CI [1Æ0, 5Æ8]); 
P = 0Æ008). Nevertheless, total hospital stay in hospital 3 
was comparable in both groups. This delay in mobilization 
could not be explained by a difference in postoperative Hb 
level of these patients: mean Hb level at day +1 was 
10Æ2 g ⁄ dl with delay and 10Æ5 g ⁄ dl without delay (NS). 
Other complications as neuropsychiatric and haemorrhage 
were not different between randomization groups within 
each hospital. 

Implementation of a new restrictive transfusion protocol in 
three different hospitals compared with the standard care 
did not result in an overall signiﬁcant reduction of RBC 
transfusions, however, this study shows that a uniform 
transfusion policy can be implemented with great reliabil- 
ity, as deviations from the trigger protocol were only 4Æ5%. 
By implementing a new presumably restrictive transfusion 
trigger, we aimed at a reduction in RBC use, but one of the 
hospitals (number 3) showed an increase instead. This can 
not be explained by a population difference or a staff com- 
pliance difference to the protocol, because patients charac- 
teristics (age, gender) were not different from hospital 
number 2 which was the other general hospital. Hospital 1 
and 2 had a liberal standard care transfusion policy. How- 
ever, hospital 3 turned out to have a different more restric- 
tive standard care policy. Furthermore, that policy did not 
consider age as a risk factor. Thus, their current standard 
policy resulted in a lower RBC use. As a result, the overall 
difference in RBC use between the original randomization 
groups was negligible. Due to heterogeneity between hospi- 
tals in primary outcome, we performed a subgroup analysis 
by hospital. Hospital number 1 had a modest RBC reduc- 
tion, but showed a signiﬁcant interaction of RBC use with 
risk group. This is explained by the difference in Hb trigger 
of age-matched patients between randomization groups in 
this hospital: the difference was largest in the low-risk 
group (age < 50 years): transfusion trigger of 6Æ4 g ⁄ dl with 
the new protocol and 9Æ7 g ⁄ dl with standard care. In the 
(cid:2) 2009 The Author(s) 
Journal compilation (cid:2) 2009 International Society of Blood Transfusion, Vox Sanguinis (2010) 98, 56–64 
intermediate group (age 50–70 years), these were 8Æ1 g ⁄ dl 
and 9Æ7 g ⁄ dl, respectively, and 9Æ7 g ⁄ dl in both arms for 
the high risk group (> 70 years). The standard care policy 
advocated to give two RBC(s) per transfusion against one 
RBC in the new protocol. In hospital number 2, a high mean 
age of the patient population (71Æ1 years) resulted in a large 
population of high risk patients who were transfused with a 
trigger of 9Æ7 g ⁄ dL according to the new, restrictive policy 
(protocol A) compared a trigger of 10Æ5 g ⁄ dl according to 
standard care (protocol B). Despite this small difference, 
still an overall reduction of transfused RBC units was 
found, but not a reduction of the percentage of transfused 
patients. In none of the three hospitals, the Hb level of the 
transfusion triggers was identical between randomization 
arms 
for high-risk 
patients (age from 70 years onwards). Hospital number 1 
had a trigger of 9Æ7 g ⁄ dl in either arm, but differed in num- 
ber of units transfused (one vs. two). The largest difference 
in transfusion protocol effect was seen in hospital number 
3, because of the exclusion of age in the standard care pro- 
tocol (protocol B), which resulted in a more restrictive 
RBC use compared with the new, age-dependent protocol 
(protocol A). 

A reduction of RBC use would not be acceptable at the 
cost of an increased hospital stay (due to increased morbid- 
ity from anaemia). However, the most restrictive transfu- 
sion policies were safe and LOHS was not affected by either 
of the two transfusion policies, although ambulation in 
hospital number 3 was slightly slowed down in the stan- 
dard care group that used the most restrictive transfusion 
policy. 
The impact of different transfusion triggers on postoper- 
ative complications (e.g. infection rate) in elective ortho- 
paedic surgery patients has not been previously reported. 
Allogeneic RBC transfusions were found to be associated 
with a higher postoperative infection rate compared with 
non-transfused patients [10–15], but these studies were 
observational and ⁄ or retrospective and performed with 
non-leucocyte-reduced RBC(s). Subgroup-analysis by hos- 
pital showed that in hospital number 1, respiratory compli- 
cations were signiﬁcantly higher in the group with the 
most liberal transfusion policy. This association should be 
further studied in future trials. 
Of the total of respiratory complications, in 14 of 21 
cases, the respiratory complications might be explained by 
the RBC transfusion itself: ﬁve cases were classiﬁed as 
transfusion related (TACO), whereas in the nine cases of 
unclassiﬁed hypoxaemia, a subclinical TACO or a transfu- 
sion related acute lung injury (TRALI) might have been 
present [16]. The occurrence of postoperative infections 
was not signiﬁcantly different between randomization 
groups. Age appeared no risk factor for postoperative com- 
plications, as shown by data of hospital number 3, who had 

a standard care policy that was more restricted and not 
age-dependent, but was not associated with an increase in 
postoperative complications, although mobilization was 
signiﬁcantly delayed in this group. Other factors, such as 
pre-existent cardiovascular disease, may play a role; how- 
ever, the current study was not powered to identify such an 
effect. In the FOCUS trial [17], an ongoing randomized, 
multi-centre study on elderly hip fracture patients (from 
50 years of age onwards), patients with cardiovascular dis- 
ease or cardiovascular risk factors are studied to investigate 
the impact of a restrictive transfusion trigger in this speciﬁc 
patient population with functional outcome as the primary 
end-point. 
This study has some limitations. First, our data can not 
be extrapolated to other hospitals in general, as the hospi- 
tal’s standard care transfusion policy turned out to be very 
different between hospitals and therefore, it is unlikely that 
these three hospitals do represent the overall transfusion 
policy in the Netherlands. Second, our study was not pow- 
ered to evaluate mortality or cardiovascular outcomes. 
Third, it is possible that our assessment of secondary end- 
points was biased since the trial and classiﬁcation of 
outcomes was not blinded. However, the secondary end- 
points were scored by use of predeﬁned objective criteria 
by the orthopaedic residents not performing the surgery. 
Fourth, to take RBC usage as a primary end-point can be 
seen as a limitation, because transfusion less blood is the 
intended intervention of a restrictive policy. However, to 
use another well-accepted primary outcome such as mor- 
tality or postoperative complications is difﬁcult, because of 
the low prevalence of such end-points in this study popula- 
tion. Although it seemed logically that a new, restrictive 
policy would always result in a RBC reduction, this was not 
the case in one hospital. 

there is a limitation concerning the 
un-transfused patients, which is a general problem con- 
cerning all transfusion medicine trials: due to the early time 
of randomization, prior to surgery, the majority of patients 
included in the study did not meet any of the criteria for 
transfusion. In our study, this concerns a large part (45 to 
80%) of the randomized patients. Ideally, a patient should 
only be randomized when a transfusion is inevitable, but in 
practice this is very difﬁcult to perform. However, by com- 
paring the randomized patients according to the intention- 
to-treat principle, both groups remain balanced in terms of 
the levels of all known confounding factors [18]. 
In conclusion, implementation of a new, intentionally 
restrictive transfusion protocol in elective hip and knee 
replacement surgery is feasible and safe without lenghten- 
ing the hospital stay. Whether a more restrictive transfusion 
policy is associated with less postoperative complications 
should be investigated in further studies, which are 
powered to ﬁnd this effect.
