Red cell transfusion is commonly used in orthopaedic 
Background and Objectives 
surgery. Evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy may be safe for most 
patients. However, concern has been raised over the risks of anaemia in those with 
ischaemic cardiac disease. Perioperative silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) has a relatively 
high incidence in the elderly population undergoing elective surgery. This study used 
Holter monitoring to compare the effect of a restrictive and a liberal red cell transfusion 
strategy on the incidence of SMI in patients without signs or symptoms of ischaemic 
heart disease who were undergoing lower limb arthroplasty. 
We performed a multicentre, controlled trial in which 260

of 119 red cell units. A postoperative episode of silent ischaemia was experienced by

In patients without preoperative evidence of myocardial ischaemia under- 
Conclusions 
going elective hip and knee replacement surgery, a restrictive transfusion strategy seems 
unlikely to be associated with an increased incidence of SMI. A proportion of these 
patients experience moderate SMI, regardless of the transfusion trigger. Use of a restric- 
tive transfusion strategy did not increase length of hospital stay, and use of this strategy 
would lead to a signiﬁcant reduction in red cell transfusion in orthopaedic surgery. Our 
data did not indicate any potential for harm in employing such a strategy in patients with 
no prior evidence of cardiac ischaemia who were undergoing elective orthopaedic surgery. 


The beneﬁts and problems associated with allogeneic blood 
transfusion in the elderly have been discussed in the recent 
medical literature [1]. The use of transfusion thresholds and 
optimal target haemoglobin concentrations attempt to balance 
the potential beneﬁts against possible risk [2]. There are cogent 
reasons to avoid blood transfusion, including haemolytic 
reactions, immunomodulation [3–5] and transmission of infec- 
tious agents [6,7]. Furthermore, red blood cells (RBCs) are a 
perishable, ﬁnite resource, the cost of which is escalating, 
as production costs that include increasingly sophisticated 
screening assays for infectious agents, as well as techniques 
 In the UK, the perceived 
. 
such as universal leucodepletion, soar 
risk of transfusion-transmitted variant Creuzfeldt–Jacob 
Disease (vCJD) has increased the cost further as some plasma 
for fractionation and for clinical use in children is now sourced 
from outside the UK. vCJD might also threaten the UK blood 
supply as a result of extended criteria for donor deferral [8,9]. 
Against all of the known and identiﬁable risks must be set 
the potential consequences of anaemia, in particular cardiac 
ischaemia. These risks are poorly deﬁned. Commensurate 
with this has been the re-evaluation of thresholds for trans- 
fusion in critical care [10]. Clearly, concerns remain over the 
effect of a restrictive transfusion threshold on patients 
with ischaemic heart disease. The available data on which to 
conﬁdently decide transfusion triggers are limited. 
In the UK, the majority of red cells are used in surgical 
patients. A multicentre survey showed that 594 810 transfused 
RBC units were successfully traced to their respective clinical 
specialties, representing 91·9% of all RBC units issued to the 
study hospitals. Of the RBC units transfused, 51·2% were 
transfused in surgical specialties and 60 470 (10·17% of the 
total) were used in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgical 
procedures. Based on National Blood Transfusion Service 
ﬁgures for 1998, when 2·24 million units of blood were issued 
≈ 
nationally, this suggests that 
 224 000 units of blood per year 
are used nationally for orthopaedics. In 24 of the hospitals 
studied in more detail over the same 12-month period, it was 
shown that 38·7% of the orthopaedic red blood cell usage was 
for primary hip and knee replacement surgery [11]. 
The volume and complexity of elective orthopaedic surgery 
is continuing to grow because of an increasingly elderly 
population, many of whom have comorbidities, including 
ischaemic heart disease. There is a clear need to deﬁne the risk 
of ischaemia in these patients. The incidence of cardiac events 
is extremely small in patients with no underlying cardiac 
disease, and massive studies would be required to explore the 
effects of anaemia on such events. However, the incidence of 
myocardial ischaemia, which may be considered a surrogate 
for myocardial events, is relatively much higher and can be 
detected and quantiﬁed by Holter continuous ambulatory 
electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring [12–14]. Previous studies 
have reported that silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) can be 
found in up to 30% of patients during the perioperative period 
following non-cardiac surgery [15–20]. Both increased inci- 
dence and duration of perioperative SMI are associated with 
adverse outcomes [21–23]. Anaemia may increase the risk of 
SMI, but there is sparse information about the relationship 
between haemoglobin concentration and SMI in this popula- 
tion of patients. To address this issue, patients undergoing 
elective hip and knee joint replacement surgery were recruited 
in order to assess the inﬂuence of a restrictive or a liberal trans- 
fusion strategy on the incidence of perioperative SMI. 

We undertook a randomized, controlled, multicentre equiva- 
lence trial. Our proposal, following a statistician’s advice, was 
to recruit 660 patients. Local and Regional Ethics Committee 
approval was obtained for all three participating acute 
hospitals in southeast England (Chelsea and Westminster, 
Royal London and Oldchurch hospitals). Written, informed 
consent was obtained from patients undergoing elective lower 
limb joint replacement. 
Exclusion criteria were age < 55 years, digoxin therapy, 
ECG evidence of conduction defects, ST segment depression, 
left ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle branch block. Any 






 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patient with anaemia was also excluded. The following patient 
information was collected: age; gender; smoking status; 
cardiovascular risk factors; history of hypertension; angina; 
previous myocardial infarction; diabetes; and cardiac drug 
therapies. 
At the preoperative visit, Holter monitors (Delmar Reynolds 
Tracker I; Reynolds Medical Limited, Hertford, UK) were 
connected to the patients using bipolar leads and silver/silver 
chloride skin electrodes. The electrode conﬁguration used 
was CM3 and CM5. The Reynolds Pathﬁnder 700 was used to 
analyse the output data. Patients were randomized preoper- 
atively using permuted blocks that were derived from random 
number tables. Envelopes containing the number and allocation 
sequence remained sealed until the patient was assigned to inter- 
vention. The patient and technician analysing the Holter tapes 
were unaware of treatment allocation. The anaesthetists and 
surgical team responsible for the patient were informed of treat- 
ment allocation. Each patient was monitored for 12 h preopera- 
tively, intraoperatively and then for a 72-h postoperative period. 
A benzodiazepine premedication was administered at the 
discretion of the anaesthetist. General anaesthesia was induced 
using propofol and fentanyl. Paralysis was achieved with 
rocuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Analgesia was admin- 
istered with a morphine patient-controlled pump, via an 
epidural (for the postoperative period only), or by a nerve block. 
All patients received postoperative oxygen while being 
Holter monitored. Transfusion was guided by an algorithm 
(Fig. 1). Normovolaemia was maintained. Patients assigned 
to the restrictive group were transfused when haemoglobin 
concentrations fell below 8 g/dl and were then maintained at 
haemoglobin concentrations between 8 and 9·5 g/dl. Patients 
allocated to the liberal transfusion group received blood 
when the haemoglobin concentration fell below 10 g/dl and 
were then maintained at haemoglobin concentrations of 
10–12 g/dl. 
An episode of silent ischaemia was deﬁned as horizontal 
or down-sloping ST segment depression of at least 1 mm 
occurring 60 ms after the J point on an ECG complex for at 



least 1 min and returning to baseline for at least 1 min. The 
ischaemic load for each patient was calculated by dividing 
the minutes of ischaemia by number of hours that the patients 
were monitored. This method of calculating ischaemic load 
was based on previous studies of SMI. 
Each patient was visited daily by a research fellow when a 
history was taken and an examination carried out. Any patient 
displaying signs or symptoms consistent with anaemia, for 
example shortness of breath, had a full blood count taken that 
day (if not one of the protocol blood test days), and if anaemia 
was conﬁrmed they were transfused to improve their clinical 
condition. At no point was the patient’s care compromised 
for the sake of the study. 
Further measurements recorded were blood loss, haemo- 
globin concentration in the recovery room and on postoper- 
ative days 1, 3 and 5, number of units transfused, length of 
postoperative hospital stay, adverse events and new infections 
requiring antibiotic therapy. Twelve-lead ECGs were recorded 
daily for the ﬁrst three postoperative days. 
Compliance with the transfusion protocol was ensured 
by blood transfusion being prescribed only by the research 
fellows involved in the study. 

The study was originally powered to demonstrate equivalence 
between the liberal and restrictive groups. Assuming the 
± 
incidence of silent ischaemia to be 30 
 10%, 330 patients were 
required per arm, for an 80% power at a 5% signiﬁcance level. 
To verify that the transfusion trigger protocols were 
adequately implemented, haemoglobin concentrations in 
each group were summarized over the entire postoperative 
monitoring period, as shown in Table 1. 
Patient characteristics and baseline measurements were 
summarized by transfusion trigger group. The primary outcome 
(i.e. ischaemic load over the whole postoperative monitoring 
period) was compared for the two trigger groups by three 
approaches: ﬁrst, the proportion of patients with any ischaemic

load was assessed by a two-sample 
 of proportions; second, 
the ischaemic load (in min/h) was compared, assuming a non- 
parametric distribution, using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
equality of distributions test; and, third, the same data were 
compared with a two-sample 
-test. Secondary outcomes were 
t 
summarized by group. 

Unfortunately, the study recruited only 260 participants, 
from a target of 660 to achieve sufﬁcient statistical power. As 
recruitment commenced it became clear that the strict exclu- 
sion criteria, speciﬁcally the ECG criteria, meant that the 
proportion of patients eligible to participate in the study was 
much lower than anticipated. This, in turn, prolonged the time 
during which recruitment took place. With a ﬁxed amount of 
funding and time available to research fellows in subspecialty 
training in England, the study had to be curtailed after 2 years. 
The total number of patients recruited into the study was 
260, of whom 218 had analysable tape recordings. The total 
ECG recording time for the whole study was 936 786 min. 
Patient demographics are summarized in Table 2. There was 
no difference in any characteristics between the two groups.

The mean haemoglobin concentrations over the postoperative 
recording period are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The 
mean haemoglobin concentration was 9·87 g/dl in the restrictive 
group and 11·09 g/dl in the liberal group. Of the 109 patients 
in the restrictive group, 37 (34%) were transfused a total of 
89 red cell units (median 0, range 0–5 units). Of those in the 
liberal group, 46 out of 109 (43%) received a total of 119 units 
(median 0, range 0–10). 
The number of patients presenting with any silent ischaemia 
during the postoperative monitoring period was 21/109 (19%) 
in the restrictive group and 26/109 (24%) in the liberal group 
(mean difference 
 = 0·41). 
There did not appear to be a temporal relationship between 
ischaemia on Holter recordings and transfusion levels, in 
particular ischaemic changes did not appear to occur when 
the haemoglobin level was at its lowest. 





The median ischaemic load was 0 min/h (range 0–4·18) in 
the restrictive group and 0 min/h (range 0–19·48) in the liberal 

group. There was no signiﬁcant difference in distribution, as 
measured by using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test ( 
 = 0·53), 
for non-inferiority. Of the small number of patients with post- 
operative SMI, the data followed a log-normal distribution. 
The data were therefore log transformed before carrying out 
-test on this subset of patients. The mean 
t 
a two-sample 
ischaemic load was 0·48 min/h in the restrictive group and 
1·51 min/h in the liberal group (ratio 0·32, 95% CI 0·14–0·76, 
P 
 = 0·011), indicating that amongst those with ischaemia, the 
ischaemic load was signiﬁcantly less in the restrictive group 
than in the liberal group. Median length of hospital stay in 
the restrictive group was 7·3 days (range: 5–11) compared 
with 7·5 days (range: 5–13) in the liberal group. 
For the entire randomized population there was no evidence 
of an overall difference in the incidence of ischaemia between 
the liberal and restrictive groups. The numbers were not large 
enough to conclude equivalence. Indeed, a far larger study of 
660 patients would be needed to provide conclusive evidence 
of no difference. 
Patient adverse events are summarized in Table 3. In the 
restrictive group, 16 adverse events occurred and in the 
liberal group 13 adverse events occurred. 
These events were for the 260 patients randomized in the 
study. One death occurred during the study. The patient in whom 
death occurred was randomized to the liberal transfusion 
strategy and died as a result of a myocardial infarction, which 
was conﬁrmed electrocardiographically and by analysis of 
cardiac enzymes. 

The main ﬁndings of the study are that the rate of SMI was 
22%, which is lower than reported in previous studies. This 
is not likely to be a result of the exclusion criteria because 
all studies measuring new ischaemic changes on Holter 
monitoring traces are subject to the same exclusion criteria 
for ECGs. In the 218 patients no difference was demonstrated 
between the restrictive and the liberal transfusion strategy in

et al 
terms of either SMI or length of postoperative stay. In those 
patients who demonstrated ischaemia, there was a signiﬁcantly 
greater ischaemic load (0·48 vs. 1·51) associated with a liberal 
transfusion strategy. The actual incidence of myocardial events 
in this study was extremely low, as was the incidence of post- 
operative infection. 
Clearly, the study falls short of the 660 patients (330 in 
each limb) required in order to conclude equivalence, but it 
is by far the largest study of its kind to date, and analysis of 
the data provides no suggestion that a signiﬁcant difference 
is likely to be found if this study were to be repeated. Indeed 
the trend, such as it was, favours a restrictive transfusion 
regime. It would be preferable if the results were conclusive, 
but that is not possible from this data. The authors feel that, 
from a clinical viewpoint, some reassurance can be gained by 
the absence of obvious morbidity on these numbers, although 
statistical certainty would have been preferable. What is worthy 
of note is that the transfusion requirements in critical care 
(TRICC) study accrued only 52% power, yet its restrictive 
transfusion strategy seems to have been adopted worldwide. 
Other problems with the study design are that patients with 
obvious ECG changes that either show, or are likely to hide, new 
cardiac ischaemia, are excluded. Paradoxically, these patients 
are considered as being in a presumed high-risk category and 
therefore by excluding them this study is focused on the more 
worrying occult ischaemic population who are not readily 
identiﬁed. It is regrettable that the measurement of troponin 
I, which is released from myocytes in SMI, was not included, 
but the study design preceded the easy availability of this test 
in the study hospitals. 
Calculating ischaemic load from Holter monitoring, and 
hence SMI, is well accepted in cardiological practice and has 
been documented in the anaesthetic literature. Holter contin- 
uous electrocardiography was employed with bipolar leads 
monitoring two channels. This had the advantages that it was 
relatively easy to perform, patient compliance was high and 
reliable results were obtained. Other studies employing two- 
channel Holter monitoring have reported similar rates of 
ischaemia [20,24]. The electrode conﬁguration allows reliable 
detection of anterolateral and septal distributions of cardiac 
ischaemia. The disadvantage is that some ischaemia may have 
been missed. Monitoring over three channels would increase 
the yield for inferior areas of the heart, but would be more 
susceptible to disruption and artefacts. The problems of 
compliance and of artefacts are a major consideration in such 
studies. Owing to technical difﬁculties with the recording 
system, 44 of our traces were incomplete, yet even this was an 
improvement on a previously reported study, in which only 
100 out of 160 tapes could be analysed. The centre analysing 
the tapes was remote from the participating hospitals and 
therefore the tapes were analysed in batches. The advantage 
of independence was offset by the time delay that occurred 
before the tapes were found to be unanalysable [25]. This 
design problem should be addressed when designing a future 
trial using Holter monitoring. 
Although this was a short-term study, the clinical con- 
sequences of SMI have been widely studied [12]. As stated 
above, SMI is associated with the release of troponin I from 
myocytes [26]. In addition, the measurement of left ventricular 
haemodynamics in patients with SMI demonstrated an increase 
in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of > 5 mmHg and an 
increased oxygen extraction in 63% of the patients studied 
[23]. In 385 elective vascular non-cardiac surgical patients, 
a long duration of SMI was predictive of adverse cardiac events 
in the perioperative period [22]. In 176 elective non-cardiac 
surgical patients, the adverse clinical consequences of SMI 
were clearly demonstrated [27]. A large study investigated 
the prevalence of SMI and new coronary events in elderly 
patients over a 45-month follow-up period. The results 
demonstrated a doubling of new coronary events in patients 
with coronary artery disease (CAD), a 1·8-fold increase in 
patients with hypertension, valvular disease but no CAD, and 
a 6·3-fold increase in those with no cardiovascular disease. 
The results of this study, however, need to be interpreted with 
caution as the mean age of the participants was 80 [28]. In 
addition, a long-term follow-up study of patients undergoing 
elective non-cardiac vascular surgery identiﬁed SMI as an 
independent correlate of cardiac death or myocardial infarction 
[29]. In these longer-term studies, perioperative SMI may be 
a surrogate marker for coronary insufﬁciency. 
All of this information indicates that Holter monitoring of 
SMI is a reasonable surrogate for the measurement of ischaemia 
in the surgical population and is, by virtue of its frequency, 
a reasonable study end point. 
Further problems in the study design were the chosen 
triggers. This really serves to indicate the rapidity with which 
the medical profession has responded to the recommendation 
for lower transfusion triggers. When this study was designed, 
the triggers chosen were considered to be low, but were accept- 
able to both ethics committees and orthopaedic surgeons, 
although with some reservations. By the completion of the 
studies, the triggers were considered normal. Consequently, 
the transfusion triggers and maintenance haemoglobin 
concentrations in the two groups could be interpreted as 
high, even for the restrictive strategy, in the light of the TRICC 
study. Ethics approval preceded the TRICC study and, in the 
absence of evidence, we may not have received approval for 
a more restrictive strategy than that used. It is important to 
emphasize that despite the studies already published, the 
evidence about these transfusion triggers and ischaemia is 
embarrassingly small. 
The incidence of serious adverse events in our study was 
low, occurring in only 17 out of 260 randomized patients. In 
., six adverse events 
a similar study reported by Nelson 
were reported in 27 patients [30]. During the current study, one 
death from a myocardial infarction occurred and this was in 







 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the liberal transfusion group. There is a common perception 
that anaemia delays mobilization of patients following lower 
limb joint replacement surgery and may therefore increase 
the length of the postoperative hospital stay. Length of stay 
was not statistically different between the groups in this 
study, although no patients in the restrictive group suffered 
from severe anaemia. 
The postoperative infection rate was low. All blood in the 
current study was leucodepleted, whereas this was not the 
case in some previous studies. Several studies have suggested 
that leucodepletion reduces the incidence of infection [31–33]. 
Increased awareness of the deleterious effects of stored blood 
and the risks of transfusion have been highlighted [34,35]. 
During blood storage, red cells become less deformable, so 
blood transfusion may paradoxically decrease microcirculatory 
oxygen delivery and contribute to tissue hypoxia [36]. Deple- 
tion of red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) and ATP, a 
reduction in deformability, and accumulation of bioreactive 
substances in storage media, are recognized consequences of 
blood storage. Several studies have addressed the possible 
adverse effects of stored red cells [37]. One review identiﬁed 
14 studies evaluating the impact of RBC transfusion on oxygen 
kinetics. Blood transfusion consistently increased oxygen 
delivery, but oxygen consumption increased in only ﬁve of 
the studies. It is possible, although purely conjecture, that these 
issues may explain the paradoxical ﬁnding that the ischaemic 
load was greater in those patients experiencing SMI who 
were assigned to the liberal transfusion strategy. 
Although this study was carried out in patients undergoing 
elective surgery, there may be useful information from the 
TRICC study, which showed that a restrictive transfusion 
policy in the critically ill is not associated with an increased 
mortality [38,39]. Younger patients and those with a low 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) 
score (< 20) seem to have a lower mortality with a lower 
transfusion threshold. However, in critically ill patients with 
cardiac disease and a high APACHE II score it was suggested 
that transfusion was associated with a lower mortality [40]. 
This ties in with the observations in Jehovah’s witnesses with 
cardiovascular disease undergoing major surgical proce- 
dures where there is a higher mortality as the preoperative 
haemoglobin falls from 10 to 6 g/dl [41]. In a subset analysis 
of the TRICC study of patients with cardiovascular disease, 
there was a non-signiﬁcant trend towards increased mortality 
at the lower transfusion threshold of 7 g/dl [42]. 
The intention of this study was to try to identify the risks 
of a restrictive transfusion policy. Clearly, implementing a 
lower transfusion threshold could lead to an important 
saving in the amount of blood transfused. Additional beneﬁt 
could be accrued if, when a restrictive policy is in place, 
‘group and save’ protocols were in place, rather than having 
crossmatched blood available, regardless of need. This may 
itself decrease the possibility of transfusion [43]. The potential 



savings of implementing a restrictive transfusion policy are 
impressive. Elective orthopaedic surgery accounts for the 
use of 
 200 000 units of blood per year in the UK alone. In 
addition, general surgeons use 13·6% of blood units issued 
nationally per annum (300 000 units), so a restrictive trans- 
fusion strategy applied to selected elective subgroups of these 
patients could achieve substantial savings. Against all of this 
is the spectre of potential harm. The present study is one of 
the few studies to be carried out comparing two transfusion 
strategies. It is underpowered to conﬁrm safety, but, at a 
minimum, serves to describe the incidence of SMI and to 
highlight the important relationship between haemoglobin 
and SMI. In doing so it goes a little way towards providing 
clinical conﬁdence in the use of this restrictive trigger. Clearly, 
larger randomized controlled studies are needed and this study 
gives a clear indication of the minimum size of such studies 
if conﬁrmation of equivalence is to be sought. 
In conclusion, in patients with no preoperative evidence of 
ischaemia on their ECG, a haemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dl 
as a transfusion trigger with a restrictive transfusion strategy 
seems unlikely to increase the risk of SMI in terms of incidence 
and may be associated with a lesser SMI load. Despite the 
belief that anaemia leads to delayed postoperative mobilization 
and therefore longer hospital stay, this study did not show an 
increased length of postoperative stay in patients assigned to 
the restrictive transfusion strategy 

This study was funded by a grant from the NHS/NBS National 
Research Review Committee.
