16% of the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.01), and adverse events oc-
curred in 40% as compared with 48% (P = 0.02). The probability of survival was
slightly higher with the restrictive strategy than with the liberal strategy in the
subgroup of patients who had bleeding associated with a peptic ulcer (hazard ratio,
0.70; 95% CI, 0.26 to 1.25) and was significantly higher in the subgroup of patients
with cirrhosis and Child–Pugh class A or B disease (hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11 to
0.85), but not in those with cirrhosis and Child–Pugh class C disease (hazard ratio,
1.04; 95% CI, 0.45 to 2.37). Within the first 5 days, the portal-pressure gradient
increased significantly in patients assigned to the liberal strategy (P = 0.03) but not
in those assigned to the restrictive strategy.
Conclusions
As compared with a liberal transfusion strategy, a restrictive strategy significantly
improved outcomes in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. (Funded

‡ Included are all red-cell transfusions received from the time of admission to discharge.
§ This category refers to the units of red cells transfused before further bleeding.
¶ Transfusions were administered in 31 patients (26 in the restrictive-strategy group and 5 in the liberal-strategy group)
because of symptoms or signs (defined as tachycardia, chest pain, or signs of severe hypoxemia) in 14 patients (8 in the
restrictive-strategy group and 6 in the liberal-strategy group) because of massive bleeding, and in 2 patients (1 in each
group) because of surgery.
‖ In the restrictive-strategy group, 39 patients without signs or symptoms, massive bleeding, or surgery received a
transfusion when the hemoglobin level was higher than 7 g per deciliter. In the liberal-strategy group, 15 patients with
a hemoglobin level lower than 9 g per deciliter did not receive a transfusion.

Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of the 6-week survival rate in the two groups. The probability of survival
was significantly higher in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group. The gray arrows indicate
the day on which data from a patient were censored. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis. Panel B
shows the hazard ratios, with 95% confidence intervals, for death by 6 weeks, according to prespecified subgroups.
In the subgroup of patients with Child–Pugh class A or B disease, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)
score (on a scale from 6 to 40, with higher values indicating more severe liver disease) was 10.3±5 in the restrictive-
strategy group and 10.9±5 in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.41). In the subgroup of patients with Child–Pugh class C
disease, the MELD score was 20.6±6 in the restrictive-strategy group and 18.1±5 in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.11).
