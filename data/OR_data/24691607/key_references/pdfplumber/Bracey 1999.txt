(14%) of 42 patients in the control group with Hb >10 g per

In this subgroup, 5 percent (5/98) of patients in the study
group received RBCs, whereas 18 percent (18/98) of control
patients underwent RBC transfusion (p = 0.004) (Fig. 2).
In the 71 study patients and the 78 control patients with
a lowest postoperative Hb level between 8 and 9 g per dL,
we found no significant differences in patient and proce-
dure-related variables. However, the transfusion rates were
significantly different: 38 percent of study patients received
RBC transfusions versus 56 percent of control patients (p =
0.025) (Fig. 2). In this subset of patients, the mean number
of RBC units transfused in the postoperative period was 0.8

We found no evidence to indicate that the study regi-
men alone delayed the necessity of RBC transfusion. A mi-
nority of patients in both groups received an RBC transfu-
sion after the first 24 hours after surgery: 21 percent in the
study group and 22 percent in the control group. The num-
ber of RBC units transfused to the study patients after 24
hours represents 22 percent of RBC units transfused in the
entire hospital stay, while in control patients, the number
represents 20 percent. The mean number of RBCs admin-
istered after the first 24 hours was 0.44 ± 0.9 in the study
group and 0.49 ± 1.1 in controls.
