mortality, PCICU and hospital length of
stay, duration of mechanical ventilation,
dose and duration of inotropic support,
total colloid infusion, coagulant product
infusions, and total mediastinal tube
drainage were similar between subject
groups. There was a trend toward in-

Subgroup Analysis of BDG and Fon-
4.5 tan Subjects. Although not powered to

3.5 analysis of BDG and Fontan subjects re-
3 vealedsimilarresults(Table4).Peakand
mean arterial lactate and mean C(a-c)O2
did not differ between study groups for
subjects specifically receiving BDG or
Fontan procedures. In BDG subjects,
mean C(a-v)O2 was significantly lower in
the restrictive group(restrictive: 3.6 (cid:4)
0.5; liberal: 4.2 (cid:4) 0.9; p (cid:5) .04). These
results were not duplicated in Fontan
subjects(restrictive: 4.2 (cid:4) 1.3; liberal:
4.1 (cid:4) 0.9; p (cid:5) .89).
DISCUSSION
Despite their uniquely compromised
physiology,childrenwithsingle-ventricle
physiology and lower hemoglobin con-
centrations were able to maintain ade-
quate tissue oxygen delivery post cavo-
pulmonary connection and did not seem
tobenefitfromaliberaltransfusionstrat-
egy.Meanandpeakarteriallactatelevels
were similar in children managed with a
restrictive and liberal transfusion strat-
egy. The adverse effects of RBC transfu-
sions are well described(12–14), and
those subjects maintained at higher he-
moglobin concentrations received
