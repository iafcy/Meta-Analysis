Redbloodcelltransfusioniscommoninpatientswithacutemyocardialinfarction(AMI).
However, observational data suggest that this practice may be associated with worse
clinicaloutcomesanddatafromclinicaltrialsarelackinginthispopulation.Weconducted
a prospective multicenter randomized pilot trial in which 45 patients with AMI and a
hematocritlevel<30%wererandomizedtoaliberal(transfusewhenhematocrit<30%to
maintain 30% to 33%) or a conservative (transfuse when hematocrit <24% to maintain
24% to 27%) transfusion strategy. Baseline hematocrit was similar in those in the liberal
andconservativearms(26.9%vs27.5%,p(cid:1)0.4).Averagedailyhematocritswere30.6%in
the liberal arm and 27.9% in the conservative arm, a difference of 2.7% (p <0.001). More
patients in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm were transfused (100% vs 54%,

patients with AMI according to a liberal transfusion strategy results in more patients
receivingtransfusionsand higher hematocritlevels.However,this maybe associatedwith
worse clinical outcomes. A large-scale definitive trial addressing this issue is urgently
required. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2011;108:1108–1111)

The initial enrollment goal for the trial was 92 patients.
After the fourth interim safety analysis, the data and safety
monitoring board determined that an adequate number of
patients had been enrolled to provide preliminary results
with respect to transfusion-related end points and clinical
safety. Therefore, in the face of slower-than-expected en-
rollment, the steering committee decided to halt further
enrollment and the study was terminated after the last en-
rolled patient completed 30-day follow-up.
