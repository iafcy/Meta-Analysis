Abstract
Background—Prior trials suggest it is safe to defer transfusion at hemoglobin levels above 7–8
g/dL in most patients. Patients with acute coronary syndrome may benefit from higher hemoglobin
levels.
Methods—We performed a pilot trial in 110 patients with acute coronary syndrome or stable
angina undergoing cardiac catheterization and a hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. Patients in the liberal
transfusion strategy received one or more units of blood to raise the hemoglobin level ≥ 10 g/dL.
Patients in the restrictive transfusion strategy were permitted to receive blood for symptoms from
anemia or for a hemoglobin < 8 g/dL. The predefined primary outcome was the composite of
death, myocardial infarction, or unscheduled revascularization 30 days post randomization.
Results—Baseline characteristics were similar between groups except age (liberal-67.3,
restrictive-74.3). The mean number of units transfused was 1.6 in the liberal group and 0.6 in the
restrictive group. The primary outcome occurred in 6 patients (10.9%) in the liberal group and 14
(25.5%) in the restrictive group (risk difference= 15.0%; 95% confidence interval of difference
0.7% to 29.3%; p=0.054 and adjusted for age p=0.076). Death at 30 days was less frequent in
liberal group (n=1, 1.8%) compared to restrictive group (n=7, 13.0%; p=0.032).

Conclusions—The liberal transfusion strategy was associated with a trend for fewer major
cardiac events and deaths than a more restrictive strategy. These results support the feasibility of
and the need for a definitive trial.
Introduction
Recently, published guidelines recommended that clinicians adopt a restrictive transfusion
strategy in most acutely ill patients.1, 2 Patients with coronary artery disease frequently
become anemic and receive transfusion because they have pre-existing anemia, undergo
invasive procedures, and receive multiple classes of anticoagulants.3 Moderate anemia may
result in increased rates of myocardial ischemia and infarction in patients with pre-existing
coronary lesions that limit myocardial oxygen delivery.4 Observational studies examining
the association between transfusion and outcomes document an association between
transfusion and increased.5 These studies are limited by confounding (more severely ill
patients also get more transfusions), making causal inferences impossible.6, 7 However,
there are no clinical trials to guide transfusion decisions in patients with acute coronary
syndrome. The absence of high quality evidence contributes to the ongoing large variation in
clinical practice8
Given this uncertainty, we undertook a multicenter pilot trial to evaluate the feasibility and
outcomes of a liberal transfusion strategy compared to a restrictive transfusion strategy in
patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease including acute coronary syndromes.
Methods
Study Population
We enrolled patients from 8 US hospitals from March 15, 2010 to May 8, 2012 who were:
1) greater than 18 years of age; 2) had either a) ST segment elevation myocardial infarction,
b) Non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, c) unstable angina, or d) stable coronary
artery disease undergoing a cardiac catheterization; and 3) had a hemoglobin concentration
less than 10 g/dL at the time of random allocation. We excluded patients who had active
bleeding from cardiac catheterization puncture site, including retroperitoneal, judged to be
uncontrolled or needing surgical repair or resulting in hemodynamic instability at any time
during the index admission; symptoms of anemia at the time of randomization; or other
health concerns (i.e., acute psychiatric illness) that would interfere with the reporting of
symptoms and adherence to treatment protocols. The institutional review board at all
participating hospitals approved the protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients. An independent data and safety monitoring board also approved the protocol
and monitored the trial.
Definitions of diagnostic categories—We defined an ST elevation myocardial
infarction as symptoms of cardiac ischemia at rest with at least one episode lasting 10
minutes and who had ST-segment elevation of 1 mm or more in two or more contiguous
leads, new left bundle-branch block, cardiac biomarkers (troponin or creatine kinase MB)
above the upper limit of the normal range. We defined a Non ST elevation myocardial
infarction as symptoms of cardiac ischemia at rest with at least one episode lasting 10
minutes AND a level of troponin or creatine kinase MB above the upper limit of the normal
range. The diagnosis of unstable angina required symptoms of cardiac ischemia at rest with
at least one episode lasting 10 minutes AND ST-segment depression of 0.01 mV or more or
transient [<30-minute] ST-segment elevation of 0.1 mV or more in two or more contiguous
leads), OR prior documented coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction, percutaneous
cardiac intervention, coronary artery bypass graft surgery), or age >55 with diabetes mellitus
or peripheral arterial disease and no biomarker elevation. For stable coronary artery disease,

we required the presence of coronary artery disease (one cardiac artery with at least 70%
obstruction by visual inspection based on cardiac catheterization or undergoing a
percutaneous cardiac intervention, during index admission).
Randomization and Intervention
Using an automated telephone system, we implemented a permuted block randomization
process stratified by clinical site and clinical diagnosis (acute coronary syndrome or stable
coronary artery disease).
Patients randomly allocated to the liberal transfusion strategy received one unit of packed
red blood cells following randomization and then received enough blood to raise the
hemoglobin concentration to 10 g/dL or above any time the hemoglobin concentration was
detected to be below 10g/dL during the hospitalization for up to 30 days. Patients
randomized to the restrictive transfusion strategy were permitted to receive a transfusion if
they developed symptoms related to anemia. A blood transfusion was also permitted, but not
required, in the absence of symptoms if the hemoglobin concentration fell below 8 g/dL.
There was no lower threshold for which blood was required in the restrictive group. Blood
was to be administered one unit at a time and the presence of symptoms reassessed. Only
enough blood was given to relieve symptoms or to increase the hemoglobin concentration
above 8 g/dL. Symptoms of anemia that were indications for transfusion included definite
angina requiring treatment with sublingual nitroglycerin or equivalent therapy, and
unexplained tachycardia or hypotension. Leukoreduction was not required.
Study Outcomes
The primary clinical endpoint was the composite rate of all cause mortality, myocardial
infarction or unscheduled coronary revascularization up to 30 days after randomization.
Secondary outcomes were: i) composite 6 month rates of all cause mortality, recurrent
myocardial infarction, or unscheduled coronary revascularization. ii) Rates of each of the
individual components of the composite outcome at 30 days and 6 months. iii) Mortality
from cardiac cause at 30 days and 6 months. iv) Unscheduled hospital admission at 30 days
and 6 months for any reason, for cardiac reason, or infection. v) Stroke at 30 days and 6
months. vi) Congestive heart failure at 30 days and 6 months. vii) Stent thrombosis at 30
days and 6 months. viii) Deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism at 30 days and 6
months. ix) Composite 30 day and 6 month infection outcome of pneumonia and blood
stream infection. x) Each of the components of the composite infection outcome at 30 days
and 6 months. xi) Composite 30 day rates of all cause mortality, myocardial infarction,
unscheduled coronary revascularization, and pneumonia. xii) Composite 6 month rates of all
cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, unscheduled coronary revascularization
and pneumonia.
Outcome adjudications and event classifications were performed by a committee composed
of two cardiologists or infectious disease specialist (for infections) masked to the assignment
group. Disagreements were settled by consensus.
Vital status was determined by telephone follow-up and a review of medical records. Deaths
were classified as definite cardiac death (sudden cardiac death, definite myocardial
infarction, congestive heart failure, cardiac procedure, cardiogenic shock, stent thrombosis,
or other), probable cardiac death (probable myocardial infarction, unwitnessed death beyond
one hour, other), cerebrovascular (stroke, other), noncardiac death (infection, cancer,
pulmonary, renal, accident, trauma/suicide, other).9
Myocardial infarction was defined using The Joint European Society of Cardiology/
American College of Cardiology Committee definitions.10 The diagnosis of myocardial

infarction required rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarkers (preferably troponin) together with
evidence of myocardial ischemia and either symptoms of ischemia or electrocardiogram
changes indicative of new ischemia. Myocardial infarction was classified as ST-segment
elevation or non-ST segment elevation.
Unstable angina was defined as: 1) the absence of elevated cardiac biomarkers and 2)
presence of ischemic symptoms or electrocardiogram changes indicative of ischemia or 3)
chest pain or angina equivalent leading to a coronary artery intervention (e.g., coronary
angioplasty) and 4) hospitalization.
Re-admission to hospital was classified, overall, for primary cardiac diagnosis (acute
coronary artery syndrome, congestive heart failure, or other), stroke, infection, or
noncardiac.
Congestive heart failure required at least one of the following symptoms or signs, new or
worsening including: dyspnea at rest, orthopnea, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, AND
radiological evidence of heart failure or worsening heart failure AND additional/increased
therapy. Hospitalization for congestive heart failure required an admission to an inpatient
unit for at least a 12-hour stay (or a date change if the time of admission/discharge is not
available). Biomarker results (e.g., brain natriuretic peptide) consistent with congestive heart
failure were considered supportive but not diagnostic of the diagnosis.
Stent thrombosis11 and pneumonia12 were also adjudicated by committee. Based on medical
record review, unscheduled coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous cardiac
intervention, stroke, deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, laboratory confirmed
blood stream infection were recorded.
We documented the number of eligible study subjects and enrollment rate. We characterized
the patients randomized in the trial, and assessed the adherence to the transfusion protocol
including the mean hemoglobin concentrations and the median number of units of red blood
cell transfusions in the two study arms. The observed frequencies of the proposed primary
and secondary outcomes were documented for study planning purposes.
Follow-up
We recorded daily hemoglobin concentrations for the first 3 days following randomization.
We did not mandate daily measurements thereafter but recorded all other hemoglobin
concentrations during the hospitalization (up to 30 days). We performed a baseline
electrocardiogram and troponin concentration prior to randomization and collected all
electrocardiograms, troponin and CK results obtained for clinical purposes. After
randomization, troponin values were obtained every 12 hours for 1 day, and then daily for 2
days or until discharge from the hospital. An electrocardiogram was performed daily up to 3
days after randomization or discharge, or when clinically indicated.
We contacted all surviving patients discharged from the hospital by telephone at 30 days and
6 months after randomization to learn of their vital status and repeated hospital admissions.
Follow-up telephone calls were performed centrally by the Clinical Coordinating Center. If a
patient was admitted to the hospital, copies of medical records were obtained.
Sample size and Analysis
We planned to enroll 200 patients. However, we terminated recruitment with the approval
the Data Safety Monitoring Committee at the end of 18 months. 110 patients had been
enrolled providing sufficient information about implementation and rates of clinical
outcomes to plan a larger trial.

We used the intention to treat principle for all randomized comparisons. Baseline
characteristics of the patients in each of the two arms of the trial were described (e.g.,
means, standard deviations, medians, interquartile ranges, and proportions) and statistically
compared using chi-square statistics for categorical variables and t-tests or Wilcoxon rank
sum statistics for continuous variables. We compared the number of units transfused and the
mean hemoglobin concentration each day between the randomized transfusion groups using
a Spearman and Wilcoxon rank sum statistics.
We used a stratified Mantel-Haenszel chi-square statistic to compare event rates for the
primary composite clinical outcome between treatment groups; alpha level of 0.05 was used
for the primary outcome. As a sensitivity analysis, a logistic regression model was created to
estimate the assigned treatment effect on the primary composite outcome adjusting for
measured baseline variables that were significantly different (p<0.05) between the two
assigned groups. The other pre-specified 30-day clinical events were compared using
standard chi-square statistics (since there were often too few events for stratification).
Randomized comparisons of time to event outcomes at 6-months were analyzed with Kaplan
Meier estimates and log rank statistics. An alpha level of 0.01 was used for all secondary
outcomes to adjust for multiple comparisons.

Results
A total of 1920 patients with a hemoglobin concentration less than 11 g/dL were screened.
The most common reasons for exclusion (Figure 1) were the hemoglobin > 10 g/dL (n=644),
patient declined (n=198), cardiac surgery was planned within 30 days (n=156), patient was
unable to provide consent (n=144), or severe illness (n=139). The incidence of hemoglobin
concentration < 10 g/dL was 24.2%. Among patients approached, consent was obtained in
25% of patients. We randomly allocated 110 patients; Robert Wood Johnson University
Hospital= 32, Montefiore-Weiler Division=24, Rhode Island Hospital=21, Montefiore-
Moses Division=15, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-Presbyterian Hospital=12,
Duke University=2, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-Passavant Hospital=2,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital=2. One patient was lost to follow-up (Figure 1).
Study Population
Clinical characteristics (table 1) were similar between the two transfusion groups with
exception of age: 74.3 years in the restrictive group compared to 67.3 years in the liberal
group; p=0.004. Pre-existing anemia was present in 41% of patients and active bleeding in
only 14% of patients.
Hemoglobin Levels and Transfusion
The mean hemoglobin concentration was between 1.3 and 1.8 g/dL higher in the liberal
transfusion group than restrictive transfusion group (all p-value < 0.001) (Table 2). On
average, the patients in the liberal arm received about 3 times as many transfusions as those
in the restrictive arm (total number of units 87 versus 27; p < 0.001). Of note, 72.7% of
patients in the restrictive arm did not receive blood transfusion. Consistent with the protocol,
the mean hemoglobin concentration at the time transfusion was implemented was 1.4 g/dL
higher in the liberal group than in the restrictive group (P<0.001) (Table 2).
Violations in the transfusion protocol occurred in five patients (9.1%) in the liberal group
and one patient (1.8%) in the restrictive group. The most common reason for protocol

violation was insufficient time to administer a transfusion prior to discharge in the liberal
group.
Thirty day and 6-month Study Outcomes
The pre-defined primary outcome of death, myocardial infarction, and unscheduled
revascularization occurred within 30 days in six patients (10.9%) in the liberal-transfusion
strategy and 14 (25.5%) in the restrictive-transfusion strategy (risk difference= 15.0%; 95%
confidence interval of difference 0.7% to 29.3%; p=0.054). Death at 30 days was less
frequent among liberal transfusion patients (n=1, 1.8%) compared to restrictive transfusion
patients (n=7, 13.0%); risk difference=11.1%, 95% confidence interval of difference 1.5% to
20.8%; p=0.032). All deaths were classified as cardiac. Most of the other adverse cardiac
outcomes were more frequent in restrictive transfusion compared with the liberal transfusion
group (Table 3).
The trend favoring liberal transfusion persisted throughout follow-up although the risk of
death, myocardial infarction, unscheduled revascularization was not statistically different in
the two groups (27.3% Liberal versus 37.0% Restrictive; risk difference=9.7%, 95%
confidence interval of difference -5.3% to 24.7%; p=0.26) (Figure 2). Similarly, the risk of
death and of death or myocardial infarction did not differ significantly by transfusion
strategy (death 12.7% Liberal versus 18.5% Restrictive, p=0.26; death/MI 23.6% Liberal
versus 33.2% Restrictive p=0.28; Figure 3B and 3C). The curves suggest that the event rates
separate by 30 days and remain parallel for 6 months.
We performed a post-hoc analysis to adjust for age, the one variable that was significantly
different between assigned groups. The unadjusted odds of death, myocardial infarction, or
unscheduled revascularization within 30 days was higher in the restrictive group than the
liberal group (odds ratio=2.86, 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 8.12, p=0.049). Adjusting
for age, the 30-day death, myocardial infarction, or unscheduled revascularization estimate
for the restrictive versus liberal strategy was slightly attenuated and was not statistically
significant (odds ratio=2.65; 95% confidence interval 0.90 to 7.78; p=0.076).
Discussion
In this multicenter pilot trial, patients transfused using a restrictive strategy had more than 2
times the rate of death, myocardial infarction or unscheduled revascularization in the first 30
days of care compared with those transfused using a liberal strategy. Although there was a
trend strongly favoring the liberal arm, we believe these data should be interpreted
cautiously. The study was small and the apparent impact of transfusion was much larger
than expected. Furthermore, the restrictive group was 6 years older than the liberal group.
We successfully implemented this pilot randomized trial in eight US centers. We noted that
patients hemoglobin levels less than 10 g/dL were common, occurring in 24.2% of patients
with acute coronary syndrome. In adopting our transfusion strategies hemoglobin levels
averaged 1.5 g/dL higher in the liberal transfusion group as compared to the restrictive
transfusion group. Also, the liberal transfusion group received 3 fold more blood
transfusions. Adherence to the protocol exceeded 94% and follow-up at six months was
achieved in 99.1% of patients. The observed rates for death and key cardiac outcomes were
high.
Prior to initiating the pilot, we anticipated enrolling a large number of patients with anemia
that resulted from bleeding. Instead, we found bleeding to be infrequent (only 14%) and pre-
existing anemia to be common (41%) resulting in fewer patients eligible for the trial. The
low rate of bleeding may reflect the widespread use of lower risk anticoagulants. Thus, we

tested the impact of transfusion in patients with chronic anemia or modest bleeding rather
than the hemorrhaging patient. Importantly, these patients had extensive co-morbidity, and
as we found in this trial, anemia is a marker for poor outcome in patients with acute
coronary disease.3
We were unable to blind the treating physician or patient to the transfusion strategy.
However, we did classify outcomes blinded to treatment assignment. We do not know if
process of care differed between the two groups of patients although adherence to the
protocol was similar.
We did learn several important lessons from the pilot that will inform the conduct of larger
trial. We plan to reduce exclusions (patients who could not consent for themselves, patients
with hemodynamic instability, and patients with life expectancy less than 6 months) to
simplify the enrollment process, increase enrollment of patients at risk of adverse
consequences of both anemia and transfusion, and enhance generalizability. We will also
include patients with demand ischemia because they represent about 15% of patients with
acute myocardial infarction and may benefit from a liberal approach to transfusion
In the critically ill and in surgery patients with stable cardiovascular disease or cardiac risk
factors, prior randomized trials support that a more restrictive approach to transfusion leads
to similar clinical outcomes compared to a liberal approach.13–15 However, patients with
acute coronary disease may require higher hemoglobin concentrations than patients without
cardiovascular disease. Oxygen delivery to the myocardium is flow dependent since the
heart extracts a high percentage of oxygen, and myocardial ischemia and ventricular
arrhythmias may be precipitated by anemia.16–18
In contrast to the findings of our trial, the only other randomized trial comparing transfusion
triggers in 45 patients with acute coronary syndrome documented an increase in the
combined rates of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and new or worsening congestive
heart failure in liberal transfusion group.19 The apparent difference seen in that study was
explained by increase risk of congestive heart failure in the liberal group. Observational
studies demonstrate conflicting results with one study finding benefit of liberal transfusion20
but most studies suggesting harm of transfusion.5 The inconsistent results among these two
small clinical trials and multiple observational studies further support equipoise on this issue
and underscore the need for a definitive trial.
This study was designed as a pilot trial, and thus, the primary goals were to assess feasibility
of enrollment, characterize the patient population with coronary disease and anemia, identify
protocol challenges, and estimate event rates. While our results are provocative, this pilot
trial was not designed to enroll enough patients to answer the transfusion dilemma currently
facing clinicians in practice.
This pilot was successful in recruiting anemic ill patients predominately with acute coronary
syndrome and implementing transfusion protocol and follow-up. The MINT pilot trial
results suggest that liberal transfusion strategy might improve outcome, although there were
few events, and large treatment differences that could be explained by chance. A large
multicenter trial is feasible and essential to definitively establish whether patients with acute
coronary syndrome benefit from liberal transfusion.
