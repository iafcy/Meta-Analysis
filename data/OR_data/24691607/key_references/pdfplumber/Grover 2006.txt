Background and Objectives Red cell transfusion is commonly used in orthopaedic
surgery. Evidence suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy may be safe for most
patients. However, concern has been raised over the risks of anaemia in those with
ischaemic cardiac disease. Perioperative silent myocardial ischaemia (SMI) has a relatively
high incidence in the elderly population undergoing elective surgery. This study used
Holter monitoring to compare the effect of a restrictive and a liberal red cell transfusion
strategy on the incidence of SMI in patients without signs or symptoms of ischaemic
heart disease who were undergoing lower limb arthroplasty.
Materials and Methods We performed a multicentre, controlled trial in which 260
patients undergoing elective hip and knee replacement surgery were enrolled and
randomized to transfusion triggers that were either restrictive (8 g/dl) or liberal (10 g/
dl). Participants were monitored with continuous ambulatory electrocardiogram
(ECG) (Holter monitoring), preoperatively for 12 h and postoperatively for 72 h. The
tapes were analysed for new ischaemia by technicians blinded to treatment. The total
ischaemia time in minutes was divided by the recording time in hours and an ischaemic
load in min/h was calculated. Haemoglobin levels were measured preoperatively,
postoperatively in the recovery room, and on days one, three and five after surgery.
Results The mean postoperative haemoglobin concentration was 9·87 g/dl in the
restrictive group and 11·09 g/dl in the liberal group. In the restrictive group, 34% were
transfused a total of 89 red cell units, and in the liberal group 43% were given a total
of 119 red cell units. A postoperative episode of silent ischaemia was experienced by
21/109 (19%) patients in the restrictive group and by 26/109 (24%) patients in the
liberal group [mean difference −4·6%; 95% confidence interval (CI): −15·5% to 6%,
P = 0·41). There was no significant difference (P = 0·53) between the overall ischaemic
load in the restrictive group (median 0 min/h, range 0–4·18) and the liberal group
(median 0 min/h, range 0–19·48). In those patients who did experience postoperative
SMI, the mean ischaemic load was 0·48 min/h in the restrictive group and 1·51 min/h
in the liberal group (ratio 0·32, 95% CI: 0·14–0·76, P = 0·011). The median postoperative
length of hospital stay in the restrictive group was 7·3 days [range 5–11; interquartile

The numbers were not large enough to conclude equivalence.
Conclusions In patients without preoperative evidence of myocardial ischaemia under-
going elective hip and knee replacement surgery, a restrictive transfusion strategy seems
unlikely to be associated with an increased incidence of SMI. A proportion of these
patients experience moderate SMI, regardless of the transfusion trigger. Use of a restric-
tive transfusion strategy did not increase length of hospital stay, and use of this strategy
would lead to a significant reduction in red cell transfusion in orthopaedic surgery. Our
data did not indicate any potential for harm in employing such a strategy in patients with

operative SMI, the data followed a log-normal distribution.
The data were therefore log transformed before carrying out
a two-sample t-test on this subset of patients. The mean
ischaemic load was 0·48 min/h in the restrictive group and
1·51 min/h in the liberal group (ratio 0·32, 95% CI 0·14–0·76,

with 7·5 days (range: 5–13) in the liberal group.
