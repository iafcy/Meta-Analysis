The optimal number of transfusions required to
decrease sickling in patients undergoing surgery is un-
known. A growing body of evidence suggests that lim-
ited dilution of sickle cells is beneficial.51,76-80 A hemo-
globin S level of 30 percent has been recommended, but
levels as high as 50 to 60 percent could be equally ef-
fective. Early studies of transfusion therapy demon-
strated a reversal of organ dysfunction despite relative-
ly high hemoglobin S levels.80,81 In vitro studies have
shown that blood flow and viscosity depend on the level
of hemoglobin and the percentage of hemoglobin
S.78,82-84 A fixed hematocrit of 30 percent minimizes the
rise in viscosity associated with higher proportions of
sickle cells.83 Moreover, interactions between reversibly
sickled cells may increase the viscosity78; the addition of
normal cells reduces these interactions, which suggests
that a relatively small number of units of transfused
blood can decrease sickling events in vivo. In patients Figure 1. Percentage of Patients in Whom New Antibodies De-
