In stable, critically ill children a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g per deciliter for red-cell
transfusion can decrease transfusion requirements without increasing adverse out-

† The average difference between the restrictive-strategy group and the liberal-strategy group was 2.1±0.2 g per deciliter

‡ The number is for all transfusions after randomization, including those given during suspension; 71 transfusions in
the restrictive-strategy group and 61 in the liberal-strategy group were given while patients were suspended from the
study. One patient in the liberal-strategy group received 29 transfusions during study suspension.
§ It was expected that red cells would be transfused if the hemoglobin concentration fell below 7 g per deciliter in the
restrictive-strategy group or below 9.5 g per deciliter in the liberal-strategy group.
¶ Attending physicians were permitted to transfuse more red cells than indicated in the study protocol if one of the fol-
lowing events occurred: severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with refractory hypoxemia; shock; instability in the
patient’s condition; acute blood loss; surgery; blood exchange-transfusion (manual or automated); hemofiltration, if
priming was done with blood; or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or plasmapheresis.

† The comparison between the restrictive-strategy group and the liberal-strategy group is given as an absolute reduction in risk.
‡ Noninferiority (NI) was checked only for the primary outcome (the number of patients who had new or progressive multiple-organ-dys-
function syndrome [MODS], including death, after randomization). The absolute risk reduction for new or progressive MODS in the re-
strictive-strategy group versus the liberal-strategy group was 0.4% (two-sided 95% CI, –4.6 to 5.5) by intention-to-treat analysis; we also
calculated a two-sided 97.5% CI of –5.4 to 6.2. Some experts also consider that a per-protocol analysis should be done in a noninferiority
trial. In the per-protocol analysis, we excluded 11 patients who did not meet the 80% adherence criterion; the number of patients with the
primary outcome was 37 of 319 (11.6%) in the restrictive-strategy group and 38 of 307 (12.4%) in the liberal-strategy group (absolute risk
reduction, 0.8%; two-sided 95% CI, –4.3 to 5.9). In all analyses, the upper limit of the confidence interval was lower than the safety margin
of error of 10% approved by consensus before the study was undertaken, which means that noninferiority was statistically significant.
§ The comparison between the restrictive-strategy group and the liberal-strategy group is given as an odds ratio.
¶ Scores on the Paediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) range from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of death.
‖ The comparison between the restrictive-strategy group and the liberal-strategy group is given as a difference between the means.
** Scores on the Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) assessment range from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating more severe
organ dysfunction. The PELOD score can be estimated over the entire stay in the ICU or over 1 day (daily PELOD). The change in the
PELOD score is the difference between the daily PELOD score at study entry and the worst daily PELOD score thereafter. Patients whose
PELOD score did not change or decreased after randomization were considered to have a change of 0.
