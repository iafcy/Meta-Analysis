Subgroup Analyses
When the patients were analyzed according to age
(<55 years vs. »55 years) and APACHE II score
(«20 vs. >20), there were no significant differences
in base-line characteristics. In the restrictive-strategy
group, 173 patients were younger than 55 years, 207
patients had an APACHE II score of 20 or less, 151
patients had cardiac disease, 100 had a traumatic in-
jury, and 114 had a severe infection or septic shock.
