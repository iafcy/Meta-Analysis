Objective
To determine whether extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) trans-
fused at lower hemoglobin thresholds versus higher thresholds have different rates of
survival or morbidity at discharge.
Study design
Infants weighing <1000 g birth weight were randomly assigned within
48 hours of birth to a transfusion algorithm of either low or high hemoglobin transfusion
thresholds. The composite primary outcome was death before home discharge or survival
with any of either severe retinopathy, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or brain injury on
cranial ultrasound. Morbidity outcomes were assessed, blinded to allocation.
Results
Four hundred ﬁfty-one infants were randomly assigned to low (n  223) or
high (n  228) hemoglobin thresholds. Groups were similar, with mean birth weight of
770 g and gestational age of 26 weeks. Fewer infants received one or more transfusions
in the low threshold group (89% low versus 95% high, P  .037). Rates of the primary
outcome were 74.0% in the low threshold group and 69.7% in the high (P  .25; risk
difference, 2.7%; 95% CI –3.7% to 9.2%). There were no statistically signiﬁcant differ-
ences between groups in any secondary outcome.
Conclusions
In extremely low birth weight infants, maintaining a higher hemoglobin
level results in more infants receiving transfusions but confers little evidence of beneﬁt.

E
xtremely low birth weight infants (ELBW  1000 g) accounted for 0.4% of all
Canadian births in 1996 to 1997 and 9% of all neonatal intensive care unit
admissions.1 These newborn infants rapidly become anemic from a combination of
frequent laboratory blood sampling and an immature hematopoietic system,2-4 leading to
the transfusion of allogeneic red blood cells (RBCs) in at least 94%.5 RBC transfusion
guidelines available at the start of this trial6,7 recommended the maintenance of the
hemoglobin of ELBW infants at “physiologic” levels, but the justiﬁcation for such an
intervention is poorly supported. The risks and beneﬁts of RBC transfusions to ELBW
infants are unclear: Limiting RBC transfusions may reduce transfusion-associated infec-
tion and iron overload, but the resulting low hemoglobin levels may result in the
morbidities associated with chronic anemic hypoxemia. A study in adult patients in critical
care8 reported no beneﬁt in survival from liberally transfusing allogeneic RBCs to
maintain a hemoglobin concentration between 100 and 120 g/L. A restrictive RBC

transfusion strategy (maintaining the hemoglobin concentra-
tion between 70 and 90 g/L) was at least as good as, and, for
some subgroups, better than the liberal strategy.
In this randomized, controlled trial, we randomly as-
signed ELBW newborn infants to RBC transfusion algo-
rithms, incorporating restrictive or liberal (low or high) he-
moglobin
“thresholds.”
The
primary
outcome
was
a
composite of either death before home discharge or survival
with severe morbidity, where severe morbidity was deﬁned as
one or more of (1) retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), (2)
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), or (3) brain injury on
cranial ultrasound. This composite outcome captured the
competing outcomes of death, or survival with severe mor-
bidity, in one measure. The purpose of this trial was to
determine whether maintaining ELBW infants at a restrictive
hemoglobin level, by adopting a restrictive (lower) RBC
transfusion threshold, led to a difference in clinical outcome
compared with a liberal RBC transfusion threshold, in the
ﬁrst weeks of post-natal life.
METHODS
Study Population
Newborn infants were enrolled from 10 neonatal inten-
sive care units in Canada, the United States, and Australia
(Appendix; available at www.jpeds.com). Eligible babies were
required to be of birth weight 1000 g, gestational age 31
weeks, and to be 48 hours old at the time of enrollment.
Infants deemed non-viable by the attending physician were
excluded, as were those with cyanotic heart disease, congenital
anemia, acute shock, transfusion after 6 hours of age, or
known parental opposition to transfusions, a family history of
anemia and hemolytic disease, or where the attending physi-
cian anticipated using erythropoietin. Informed consent was
requested from the parents or guardians. After consent, in-
fants were individually randomly assigned to either the re-
strictive or the liberal threshold for RBC transfusion. Treat-
ment allocation was by telephone to an interactive voice
system at the coordinating center. The concealed computer-
generated randomization sequence was stratiﬁed by center
and birth weight (750 g, 751 to 999 g) and incorporated
random block sizes. The study was approved by each local
research ethics board.
Intervention
Infants were allocated to a transfusion algorithm of low
or high hemoglobin thresholds for transfusion (Table I). The
algorithm was developed by consensus among participating
sites, against the background of then current guidelines.6,7
The appropriate hemoglobin threshold was adjusted for cap-
illary or arterial/venous blood sampling according to prior
work.9 The thresholds developed were based on whether or
not the infant was receiving respiratory support (assisted
ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, or supple-
mental oxygen) and on post-natal age. The protocol did not
dictate how or how often the hemoglobin value was to be
determined, but all hemoglobin values were recorded. Phle-
botomy losses were not recorded. Transfusion was indicated
whenever the hemoglobin equaled or fell below the threshold
value. In addition, attending neonatologists were allowed to
give non-algorithm dictated RBC transfusions in the event of
shock, severe sepsis, coagulation defects, surgery, or for un-
anticipated emergencies. RBC transfusions were given within
6 hours of the hemoglobin determination, but as soon as
possible after the attainment of a threshold value. All trans-
fusions consisted of washed, packed RBCs (homologous or
directed donation) given at 15 mL/kg at rates determined by
local policy. No attempt was made to blind caregivers with
respect to treatment group, as the concealment of hemoglobin
values was considered both unethical and impractical. The
transfusion algorithm was distributed widely and placed
prominently at the site of care of each study patient. The
allocated transfusion algorithm was maintained after dis-
charge from tertiary care to the level 2 nursery, but data
collection was limited to transfusions, hemoglobin levels
prompting transfusion, and hemoglobin at discharge. All cen-
ters used iron supplementation according to local guidelines.
Data Collection
All data, including Score for Acute Physiology (SNAP)
scores, were collected from entry to discharge by using spe-
ciﬁcally designed case report forms. Routine care of ELBW
infants at all participating institutions included ﬁrst-week and
pre-discharge cranial ultrasounds and pre-discharge retinal
examination. Donor exposure to RBCs, platelets, and fresh

frozen plasma was ascertained retrospectively from blood
bank records at each institution.
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome included the main clinically rel-
evant morbidities experienced before ﬁrst neonatal discharge
home and was a composite of either death or survival with one
or more of
(i) ROP: Grades 3 through 510;
(ii) BPD: Supplemental oxygen requirement at a postconcep-
tual age of 36 weeks or later11;
(iii) Brain injury: Presence of cystic periventricular leukoma-
lacia, intra-parenchymal echodensity, porencephalic cyst,
or ventriculomegaly on the “worst” cranial ultrasound
available before discharge.12
In all infants, these assessments were performed in the
ﬁrst week of life and before discharge from the tertiary care
hospital. The presence of severe ROP was based on a locally
interpreted retinal assessment conducted by an ophthalmol-
ogist unaware of treatment group. The need for oxygen at 36
weeks was determined by the attending physician. Cranial
ultrasounds were interpreted independently by a blinded,
two-person committee (JM and PG) who reviewed all images;
where one reviewer disagreed with the local report, the com-
mittee adjudicated the ﬁnal results.
Secondary Outcomes
Pre-speciﬁed secondary outcomes included hemoglobin
level, numbers of RBC transfusions, numbers of donor expo-
sures, rate of growth (as weekly weights and head circumfer-
ences), and serum ferritin change from early to discharge
values. Other recorded outcomes included numbers of infants
with necrotizing enterocolitis or with apnea requiring treat-
ment and the use of xanthines or doxapram, culture proven
infections, or requiring post-natal steroids. We also recorded
time in oxygen, time to extubation, and time to discharge.
Sample Size and Statistical Analysis
The planned sample size of 424 neonates was based on
detecting, with 90% power, an absolute risk reduction of 15%
in either direction (a two-sided  of 0.05) for the primary
outcome. Analyses of outcomes were adjusted for birth weight
stratum and center, using a logistic regression model. Cumu-
lative mortality was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier meth-
od.13 The analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat
basis. Data were reviewed by an external safety and monitor-
ing committee. One formal interim analysis of efﬁcacy was
conducted at the mid-point, which required a value of P 
.001 to stop the trial.
RESULTS
Study Population
A total of 795 infants were screened for entry into the
study from January 2000 to February 2003 inclusive, of whom
694 were eligible and 451 were subsequently randomly as-
signed (Figure 1; available at www.jpeds.com). Consent was
not obtained for 136 infants, and the parents of 107 were not
approached to participate because parents were not available
or not accessible for consent within 48 hours of birth. Two
hundred twenty-three infants were allocated to the restrictive
(low threshold) group and 228 to the liberal (high threshold)
group. Both groups were similar with respect to initial ma-
ternal and infant variables, including those reﬂecting severity
of illness (Table II; available at www.jpeds.com). Birth weight
was not signiﬁcantly different between those enrolled and
those eligible but not enrolled (P  .28). Numbers recruited
ranged in the 10 centers from 6 to 94 (median 42).
Hematologic and Transfusion Outcomes
From initially similar levels, hemoglobin declined with
time in both treatment groups but with a weekly mean con-
sistently higher in the high threshold group (Table III). The
separation in the mean hemoglobin levels was statistically
signiﬁcant within the ﬁrst week and stabilized at about 10g/L
by week 4. The mean hemoglobin separation slowly declined
during the remainder of the neonatal hospitalization, remain-
ing statistically signiﬁcantly different up to 12 weeks, becom-
ing no longer signiﬁcantly different by discharge (Figure 2).
As a result of maintaining a reduced hemoglobin level, the
low threshold group received fewer RBC transfusions (mean,
4.9 units) than the high threshold group (mean, 5.7 units) but
this difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (P  .070).
However, the mean number of transfusions triggered by a
hemoglobin threshold was signiﬁcantly lower in the low
threshold group, but this difference was offset by a small but
statistically signiﬁcant difference in the opposite direction in
transfusions given for “clinical reasons,” many of which were
for bleeding or surgery (Table IV; available at www.
jpeds.com). However, the total number of these transfusions
was low (7.4% low group versus 3.1% high group). The
median day of ﬁrst transfusion was 4 days in both groups. By
discharge from the hospital, 89% of infants in the low thresh-
old group had received a transfusion either by algorithm or
clinical decision, compared with 95% in the high threshold
group (P  .037). The mean number of blood product donors
to which infants were exposed was slightly lower in the low
threshold group, both for all blood products and for RBCs
speciﬁcally, but the differences were only statistically signiﬁ-
cant for RBC donors (P  .035).
Primary Outcome
The primary outcome was the combination of either
death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, severe
retinopathy of prematurity, or brain injury. The outcome
status of all infants was known (ie, there was no loss of infant
data). During the neonatal period, 74.0% of the low threshold
group had this outcome, compared with 69.7% of infants
allocated to the high threshold cohort (Table V). The birth
weight–adjusted and center strata–adjusted difference of 2.7%

(High) Transfusion Threshold For Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants

was not statistically signiﬁcant (P  .25; 95% CI, 3.7% to
9.2%). With the exception of brain injury, the individual
components of the composite primary outcome each slightly
favored the high threshold group, but all differences were
statistically nonsigniﬁcant. Table VI (available at www.jped-
s.com) details the frequency of the head ultrasound ﬁndings
by group and by survival status. The frequency of the primary
outcome between centres was not signiﬁcantly different (P 
.75). The Kaplan-Meier plot (Figure 3; available at www.
jpeds.com) shows no signiﬁcant differences in cumulative
mortality rates at any time after random assignment. At the
median follow-up of 12 weeks, the cumulative mortality rate
approximates the overall mortality rate, as seen in Table V.
There was no evidence that the treatment effect varied by
birth weight strata.
Secondary Outcomes
The treatment effects on protocol-designated secondary
outcomes and other outcomes assessed during hospitalization
are shown in Table VII. Data for growth were analyzed at 32
weeks’ corrected age because of varying times of discharge.
There were no signiﬁcant differences demonstrated in any
secondary outcomes. In particular, there were no statistically
signiﬁcant differences in duration of ventilatory support,
growth, or length of hospital stay. Similarly, the observed
differences in the other outcomes were all quite consistent
with chance variation, given the number of comparisons being
made.
DISCUSSION
In this randomized, controlled trial, we allocated acutely
ill, ELBW infants during their ﬁrst 2 days of life to an
algorithm of either a low or a high hemoglobin transfusion
threshold, which was maintained until discharge. As a result,
the high threshold group had a mean hemoglobin concentra-
tion about 10 g/L higher than the low threshold group during
the ﬁrst 4 weeks of life. This difference in hemoglobin level
slowly dissipated over the neonatal hospitalization period as

blood sampling declined and the infant matured. This was
associated with a lower likelihood of receiving at least one
transfusion in the low threshold group despite a slightly
higher use of “clinically” driven RBC transfusions. Presum-
ably, the hemoglobin thresholds in the low threshold group
resulted in later RBC transfusions as well as a reduction in
algorithmic determined RBC transfusions when compared
with the high threshold group.
No statistically or clinically important between-group
difference was observed in the primary composite outcome of
death or neonatal morbidity. The primary composite outcome
captured the competing risks of death or survival with serious
morbidity, by combining the most frequent and serious com-
plications in the ELBW survivors with death. These compli-
cations (ultrasound brain injury, ROP, BPD) independently
adversely affect neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months’
corrected age.14 These conditions are thought to result from
hypoxic ischemia, oxygen radical toxicity, or iron overload
mediated oxygen toxicity.15-19 Our study was of sufﬁcient size
to detect a 15% absolute difference in this clinically relevant
primary outcome with 90% power. Despite this, the 95%
conﬁdence interval for the true risk difference ranged from
3.7% (favoring low) to 9.2% (favoring high). Therefore, as
a worse-case scenario, the prescribing clinician must weigh
whether adopting a low hemoglobin threshold with a poten-
tial 9% increase in poor neonatal outcome is offset by the need
for fewer RBC blood transfusions. Nonetheless, the adjusted
difference of 2.7% (only slightly favoring the high threshold)
is most likely the true effect size in the conﬁdence interval
range.
Two studies exist of similar strategies to limit early
transfusions.20,21 One trial, using adjunctive therapy with
erythropoietin, found no signiﬁcant clinical differences.20 Our
thresholds were similar to prior recommendations.20-22 In a
trial of late RBC transfusion, restriction had no effect on the
incidence or severity of ROP.23 We found no important
differences in either the composite outcome or the individual
outcomes over the initial neonatal hospitalization.
A similar but smaller trial (n  100) by Bell et al21 was
powered for the primary outcome of number of transfusions.
They achieved a larger hemoglobin separation and corre-
spondingly bigger effect on the mean number of transfusions,
and reported a signiﬁcant difference (in favor of the liberal,
high threshold group) for the combined outcome of intraven-
tricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade 4 or periventricular leu-
komalacia (PVL). This latter combination was not a pre-
speciﬁed outcome. In addition, Bell et al enrolled infants later
and may have received up to two prior transfusions; further-
more, late head ultrasound ﬁndings were reported in only half
of the infants enrolled. The PINT secondary outcome of
“brain injury” includes a somewhat different mix of ultrasound
ﬁndings but shows little evidence of a treatment difference,
and, if anything, favors the low threshold group. These dis-
crepant ﬁndings may be attributable to the play of chance,
differences in protocols of enrollment, and outcome measure-
ment.
Before the current generation of trials,20-23 two small,
randomized trials were performed in larger, more stable in-
fants.24,25 No differences in short-term outcomes were de-
scribed. Prior recommendations for allogeneic RBC transfu-
sion were derived from small, non-randomized studies,
advocating allogeneic RBC transfusions to prevent apnea, to
foster weight gain and growth,26 or to increase oxygenation in
ventilated infants.27 Others have challenged the notion of
impaired oxygenation from lower hemoglobin values,28 al-
though other observational studies caution against lower he-
moglobins.29 None of the secondary outcomes in our study
indicate the presence of harm from adopting a lower trans-
fusion threshold regimen. The lack of statistically signiﬁcant,
important differences in numbers of infants with apnea are
consistent with studies of apnea frequency measured objec-
tively with pneumocardiography, where there was no docu-
mented increase in number or severity of apneas by hemoglo-
bin range.30 Volume infusion alone, whether as RBCs or as
albumin, was associated with similar reductions in apnea rate.
This is consistent with observations of Bell et al of a decrease
in the rate of apnea associated with transfusion, which did not
translate into a signiﬁcant reduction in the numbers of infants
with apnea.21

sions have focused largely on one of three main strategies:
minimizing sampling loss, using erythropoietin, or using sim-
ple transfusion guidelines.31 Enthusiasm for early interven-
tion with erythropoietin32 has been tempered both by safety
concerns33 and disappointing results from clinical trials.34
Many RBC transfusion guidelines have suggested
downward revisions, but the safety or potential beneﬁts of
either the upper or lower hemoglobin limits recommended
have not been adequately tested. Our study incorporated
transfusion thresholds that fall within then-current clinical
practice boundaries and guidelines.6 Controversy arose from
the ARDS NET trial, from suggestions that the chosen
interventions were beyond the boundary of clinical prac-
tice.35,36 In this trial, we incorporated a comparison of algo-
rithms, which, while within clinical practice boundaries, were
expected to create a separation in mean hemoglobin between
groups. We decided to allow additional “clinically driven”
RBC transfusions in speciﬁc situations. We recognized that
this clinical judgment might be differentially applied; in fact,
these “clinical” transfusions were more frequent in the lower
hemoglobin arm. However, there was no way to achieve a
pragmatic trial without, for example, enabling surgeons and
anesthetists to transfuse for “clinical reasons.” Although the
contrast between high and low groups was slightly less than
that achieved in adults in the TRICC trial (107 versus 85)8 or
in Bell’s study,21 this present study achieved a likely physio-
logically important difference in hemoglobin between groups
throughout much of the hospital stay. This difference was
especially evident in the ﬁrst 2 weeks of life. This trial could
not be powered to detect differences in rates of RBC trans-
fusion-related infections. However, transfusion frequency was
taken as a proxy for this outcome, and this was marginally
reduced in the low threshold group. Rates of all bacterial
culture–proven infections were similar in the two groups
(Table VII).
The present ﬁndings provide evidence that transfusion
thresholds in ELBW infants can be moved downward by at
least 10 g/L, without incurring a clinically important increase
in the risk of death or major neonatal morbidity. Further
studies will be required to clarify residual concerns about
secondary outcomes.

Figure 3. Cumulative mortality rates with 95% conﬁdence intervals.
Kaplan-Meier curve is plotted from time from random assignment by
group. Dotted line depicts the low threshold group; solid line depicts high
threshold group. At time intervals of 5, 10, 15, and 20 weeks after
randomization, 95% conﬁdence intervals are depicted. Overall P  .29.
Below x-axis are the “number at risk” in both the low and high groups.
These are the infants still alive at that time and not yet discharged home
from the neonatal intensive care unit, that is, all infants who have not yet
reached one of the primary end points.
