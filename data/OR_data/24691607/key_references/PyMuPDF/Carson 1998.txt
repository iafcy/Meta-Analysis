BACKGROUND: The indications for transfusion have 
never been evaluated in an adequately sized clinical 
trial. A pilot study was conducted to plan larger clinical 
trials. 
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Hip fracture patients 
undergoing surgical repair who had postoperative hemo- 
globin levels less than 10 g per dL were randomly as- 
signed to receive 1) symptomatic transfusion: that is, 
transfusion for symptoms of anemia or for a hemoglobin 
level that dropped below 8 g per dL or 2) threshold 
transfusion: that is, patients receive 1 unit of packed 
RBCs at the time of random assignment and as much 
blood as necessary to keep the hemoglobin level above 
10 g per dL. Outcomes were 60-day mortality, morbidity, 
functional status, and place of residence. 
RESULTS: Among 84 eligible patients enrolled, mean 
(&D) prerandomization hemoglobin was 9.1 (* 0.6) g/ 
dL. The median number of units transfused in the 
threshold transfusion group was 2 (interquartile range, = 
1 -2), and that in the symptomatic transfusion group was 
0 (6; interquartile range, = 0-2) (p<O.OOl). Mean hemo- 
globin levels were approximately 1 g per dL higher in the 
threshold group than in the symptomatic group: for ex- 
ample, on Day 2, 10.3 (* 0.9) g per dL versus 9.3 (* 1.2) 
g per dL, respectively (p<O.OOl). At 60 days, death or in- 
ability to walk across the room without assistance oc- 
curred in 16 (39.0%) of the symptomatic transfusion 
group and 19 (45.2%) of the threshold transfusion 
group. Death occurred by 60 days in 5 (1 1.9%) of the 
symptomatic transfusion group and 2 (4.8%) in the 
threshold transfusion group (relative risk = 2.5; 95% CI, 
0.5-12.2). Other outcomes were similar for the two 
groups. 
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic transfusion may be an ef- 
fective blood-sparing protocol associated with the transfu- 
sion of appreciably fewer units of RBCs and lower mean 
hemoglobin levels than are associated with the threshold 
transfusion policy. However, it is unknown whether these 
two clinical strategies have comparable mortality, morbid- 
ity, or functional status. A definitive trial is needed. 
n 1992, over 11 million units of red cells (RBCs) were 
transfused in the United States.’ Each unit of RBCs is 
estimated to cost about $150 to $200, for a total an- 
I 
nual expenditure of approximately $2 billi~n.~-~ 
Most 
RBC transfusions are given to surgical patients. While there 
is extensive literature documenting the risks associated 
with tran~fusion,~*~ 
much less is known about the indica- 
tions for transfusion and the benefits of transfusion in the 
perioperative setting. 
In five small randomized clinical trials that contrasted 
transfusion thresholds, no differences were observed be- 
tween transfusion groups,’-” except for the finding in one 
study of delayed myocardial recovery in patients with lower 
hemoglobin (Hb)  level^.^ However, the largest of these tri- 
als included only69 patients. An observational cohort study 
of 1957 surgical patients who refused blood transfusion for 
religious reasons suggests that mortality in surgical patients 
starts to increase at Hb levels below 10 g per dL; patients 
with cardiovascular disease had higher mortality with ane- 
mia than those without cardiovascular disease. A retrospec- 
tive cohort study of 8787 hip fracture patients found no 
association between postoperative transfusion and 30- or 
90-day mortality.13

TRANSFUSION TRIAL FOLLOWING HIP FRACTURE 
As a preliminary step in evaluating the clinical benefit 
of transfusion, we conducted a pilot study for a randomized 
clinical trial comparing two transfusion strategies. The 
goals of this pilot study were to demonstrate 1) that recruit- 
ment of an elderly population of patients with hip fracture 
was feasible, 2) that the study protocol could be imple- 
mented and would result in different mean Hb levels and 
numbers of units transfused in the groups, and 3) that fol- 
low-up for mortality, place of residence, and functional sta- 
tus could be completed. 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
Study deslgn and study population 
We performed a randomized clinical trial in hip fracture 
patients who underwent surgical repair from March 1996 
to March 1997. All patients presenting for hip fracture re- 
pair were assessed for eligibility for the study. Patients were 
eligible for the trial if their Hb levels were less than 10 g per 
dL in the immediate postoperative period, defined as the 
time from the end of anesthesia in the operating room to 
11:59 PM 3 days after surgery (counted from 12:OO midnight 
on the first day after surgery). Hb levels were measured on 
each of the first three postoperative days to identify eligible 
subjects. Patients who refused transfusion because of reli- 
gious beliefs, suffered multiple trauma (defined as any in- 
jury that required surgical repair in addition to the hip frac- 
ture), or had symptoms of anemia were excluded from the 
trial. 
The study was performed at RobertWood Johnson Uni- 
versity Hospital, a 491-bed university hospital located in 
New Brunswick, NJ; St. Peters Medical Center, a 450-bed 
university-affiliated hospital also located in New Brunswick 
Miriam Hospital, a 247-bed university-affiliated hospital 
located in Providence, RI; and The Royal Infirmary of 
Edinburgh (for only 1 month), an 828-bed university hos- 
pital located in Edinburgh, Scotland. The Edinburgh site 
was added at the end of recruitment and was included in 
the evaluation of treatment outcome but not in the evalu- 
ation of recruitment experience. In accordance with the 
principle of intention to treat, all randomly assigned pa- 
tients are counted in treatment comparisons. Random 
treatment allocation and ongoing monitoring of enrollment 
were managed on an automated telephone-response sys- 
tem at the Maryland Medical Research Institute (Baltimore, 
MD). Institutional review board or an ethics committee 
approved the study at each institution. 
Transfuslon strategies 
Eligible patients who gave informed consent (or, for those 
not mentally competent, whose relatives gave informed 
consent) were randomly assigned to one of two transfusion 
strategy groups. The threshold transfusion strategy required 
patients to receive 1 unit of packed RBCs at the time of ran- 
domization and as much additional blood as needed to 
keep the Hb level above 10 g per dL during the hospital 
admission.The symptomatic transfusion strategy required 
that transfusion be delayed until the patient developed 
symptoms or experienced consequences of anemia, but 
transfusion was permitted in the absence of symptoms if 
the Hb level fell below 8 g per dL. If transfusion was given 
for symptoms of anemia, enough blood was given to relieve 
the symptoms; if transfusion was given because the Hb level 
fell below 8 g per dL, enough blood was given to increase 
the Hb level above 8 g per dL. Postrandomization Hb level 
evaluations were performed at least twice in all patients and 
as clinically indicated. 
Symptoms and consequences of anemia were defined 
as chest pain thought to be cardiac in origin; myocardial 
infarction (MI); congestive heart failure; unexplained 
tachycardia, hypotension, or decreased urine output that 
was unresponsive to fluid replacement; and poor rehabili- 
tation, defined as inability to get out of bed for rehabilita- 
tion by the third postoperative day. 
Outcomes 
primary outcome.The outcome of most interest was death 
within 60 days of the operative procedure or the inability 
to walk 10 feet or across a room without human assistance 
60 days after surgery. These possible outcomes were cho- 
sen because the main objective after hip fracture surgery 
is to restore function, and Hb levels may be important to 
patient recovery. Information about walking ability was 
ascertained by telephone interviews. If the patient could 
not be interviewed directly, information was obtained from 
either a family member or health care provider. 
Secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were 30- 
and 60-day mortality, place of residence at 60 days, func- 
tional status at 60 days, in-hospital myocardial infarction, 
thromboembolism, stroke, and pneumonia. Residence sta- 
tus for the patients were classified as follows: community 
dwelling (home alone, home with others), retirement home 
(e.g., sheltered housing, congregate housing, halfway 
house, or board and care facility), nursing home (e.g., 
skitled-nursing facility, intermediate-care facility, extended- 
care facility), or other. 
We assessed functional status with questions designed 
to evaluate lower extremity function after hip fracture.14J5 
The activities queried were 1) getting in and out of bed, 2) 
walking 10 feet or across the room, 3) walking one block on 
level sidewalk, 4) climbing five stairs, 5) getting into and out 
of a car, 6) rising from an armless chair, 7) putting on pants, 
8) putting socks and shoes on both feet, 9) getting in and 
out of bath or shower, and 10) taking a shower, bath, or 
sponge bath. For each task, patients were classified as re- 
quiring no help, requiring the use of equipment only, requir- 
ing human assistance (with or without equipment), or be- 
ing unable to perform the task for health reasons. Any

CARSON ET AL. 
patient who died within the first 60 days was classified as 
being unable to perform the task for health reasons. If the 
patient did not perform the task for reasons other than 
health or was unable to accurately define the level of assis- 
tance needed, the score for that specific task was treated as 
missing. 
Postoperative MI was defined as definite if the patient 
had positive CK-MB enzymes, if an electrocardiogram was 
interpreted locally as consistent with a MI, or if there was 
postmortem evidence of an acute MI. MI was defined as 
possible if the patient had chest pain and an electrocardio- 
gram interpreted as consistent with possible new MI. 
Thromboembolism was defined as deep venous 
thrombosis confirmed by duplex ultrasound, impedance 
plethysmography, venogram, or postmortem examination 
or as pulmonary embolism confirmed by a high-probabil- 
ityventilation-perfusion scan, or pulmonary angiogram, or 
postmortem examination.16-” 
Stroke was defined as definite if there. was evidence of 
a new hemorrhage or infarction on a magnetic resonance 
image study, CT scan of the head, or autopsy. Stroke was 
defined as possible if there was an unsupported physician 
diagnosis of neurologic deficit. 
We used a modified Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) case definition of pneumonia22: chest ra- 
diograph with new or progressive infiltrate, consolidation, 
or cavitation and any of the following: new onset of puru- 
lent sputum or change in character of sputum, or the iso- 
lation of the organism from blood culture, transtracheal 
aspirate, bronchial brushings, or biopsy. We did not con- 
sider a patient with rales and purulent sputum to have 
pneumonia, nor did we use pleural effusion in our chest 
radiograph definition. 
Randomization 
Study personnel at the clinical sites randomly assigned 
patients by contacting the data coordinating center’s 24- 
hour automated telephone service. Randomization sched- 
ules were stratified by clinical site and cardiovascular dis- 
ease status; the randomization was designed in blocks of 
two to eight patients to avoid imbalance within a site. Bal- 
anced randomization of patients with cardiovascular dis- 
ease was deemed important because prior data suggested 
that patients with cardiovascular disease may not tolerate 
anemia as well as patients without cardiovascular disease. l2 
Cardiovascular disease was defined by a history of 
ischemic heart disease (MI, angina pectoris, or evidence of 
coronary artery disease) or by an electrocardiogram with 
evidence for previous MI, history or presence of congestive 
heart failure, chest radiograph consistent with congestive 
heart failure, history or presence of peripheral vascular dis- 
ease, or history of stroke or transient ischemic attack. 
Data collection 
Study nurses abstracted data primarily from the patients’ 
medical records and the administered study question- 
naires. Additional information was obtained from the pa- 
tients’ physician(s) as needed. Chronic lung disease was 
defined by a history, chest radiograph interpretation, or 
pulmonary function test consistent with chronic obstruc- 
tive pulmonary, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or restric- 
tive lung disease. Diabetes mellitus was defined by a his- 
tory of diabetes mellitus treated with oral medication or 
insulin. Dementia or confusion was defined by a prefracture 
history of confusion, disorientation, global intellectual im- 
pairment, or memory loss. 
The type of hip fracture was classified as femoral neck 
(subcapital, cervical, midcervical, transcervical, intracapsu- 
1x1, intertrochanteric (basilar, basicervical, pertrochanteric, 
or extracapsular), or subtrochanteric (proximal femur).The 
American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical sta- 
tus assessment was recorded.z3~24Thromboem-bolism 
pro- 
phylaxis was classified as warfarin, low-molecular-weight 
heparin, intravenous heparin, or subcutaneous heparin 
(10,000-30,000 unitslday), pneumatic compression stock- 
ings, or aspirin.The type of thromboembolism prophylaxis 
was chosen by the attending physician. We recorded the 
number of blood transfusions during the preoperative, intra- 
operative, and postoperative periods; the last preoperative 
Hb level; and the postoperative Hb levels. 
Data collection was completed with a telephone inter- 
view 60 days after. Study nurses, blind to the transfusion 
status of the patient, obtained information from patients or 
proxies on survival, place of residence, and functional sta- 
tus. 
Statistical analysis 
We performed all the analyses using the intention-to-treat 
principle. Patient characteristics were compared by using 
tests for homogeneity of proportions for categorical vari- 
ables and the l test to test for differences in mean (* SD) or 
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test for distributions represented by 
median and interquartile ranges. Relative risk and 95% CI 
were calculated by standard methods. 
RESULTS 
There were 192 eligible hip fracture patients admitted to the 
three US study hospitals. We obtained consent from 143 
(74%) of these patients. Ninety-six (67%) of these 143 pa- 
tients had a Hb level less than 10 g per dL in the immediate 
postoperative period. We randomly assigned 80 (83%) of the 
96 patients40 in each of the two treatment groups. The 
reasons for not enrolling the remaining 16 patients were 
that the attending physician declined to permit random 
assignment of 14 patients, one patient had been randomly

assigned within the previous month, and one patient was 
withdrawn by the spouse. We recruited 42 percent of eligible 
hip fracture patients at the US study sites (Fig. 1). In addi- 
tion, 4 (9.8%) of 41 patients were enrolled in Edinburgh: 2 
patients were randomly assigned to each of the two treat- 
ment groups. 
Of the 84 enrolled patients, 3 refused to comply with 
the study protocol after randomization, although follow-up 
was completed at 60 days. The assigned transfusion strat- 
egy was successfully implemented in 93.8 percent (76181) 
of the remaining patients. One patient in the threshold 
transfusion group did not receive a transfusion, and four 
patients in the symptomatic transfusion group received a 
transfusion in violation of the protocol (i.e., they did not 
have symptoms of anemia or a Hb of c8 gldL). Sixty-day 
follow-up was obtained in all patients. The overall study

population had a mean age of 82.3 (k9.5) years and was pre- 
dominatelywhite and female (Table 1). Cardiovascular dis- 
ease was present in 45.2 percent and a history of dementia 
or confusion in 35.7 percent. Most patients had intertro- 
chanteric fractures (65.5%) and underwent general anes- 
thesia (60.7%). The mean prerandomization Hb level was 
9.1 g per dL (k 0.6). The two groups were similar in these 
baseline characteristics. 
The median number of units transfused differed in the 
two transfusion groups: in the threshold transfusion group, 
it was 2 (maximum of 4, interquartile range = 1-21, and in 
the symptomatic transfusion group, it was 0, (maximum of 
6, interquartile range = 0-2), p<O.OOl (Table2). Nineteen pa- 
tients (45.2%) in the symptomatic transfusion group re- 
ceived transfusion(s) . 
The lowest mean Hb level after randomization in the 
symptomatic transfusion group was 8.75 g per dL (SD f 1.2: 
range, 5.6-11.4 gldL). The highest 
mean Hb level in the threshold trans- 
fusion group was 11.1 g per dL (SD f 
0.9: range, 8.6-14.0 gldL). Mean daily 
Hb levels in the transfusion groups 
differed by approximately 1 g per dL 
from the time of randomization until 
discharge from the hospital (Fig. 2). 
Sixty days after randomization, 
16 (39.0%) patients in the symptom- 
atic transfusion group and 19 (45.2%) 
in the threshold transfusion group 
were dead or could not walk across 
the room or 10 feet without human 
assistance (relative risk = 0.9,95% CI 
0.5-1.4, p = 0.57) (Table 3). Five

pital stay were similar in the groups. 
Morbid events were uncommon 
(Table 3). There were no appreciable 
differences in outcomes in patients 
with and without cardiovascular dis- 
ease. 
Many patients had important 
limitations in function at 60 days 
(Table 4). Only 57.8 percent of pa- 
tients could walk across the room or 
10 feet, and 51.8 percent could get in 
and out of bed without the assistance 
of another person.

DISCUSSION 
RBC transfusion is a commonly used 
treatment that is expensive and in- 
volves important risks. In this pilot 
study, we successfully enrolled eld- 
erly patients with hip fracture, and in 
most patients the assigned transfu- 
sion protocol was appropriately fol- 
lowed. The two transfusion strategy 
groups had clinically important and 
significant differences in the number 
of RBC units transfused and in the 
mean Hb levels during the hospital- 
ization for hip fracture repair. 
Before the National Institutes of 
Health 1988 consensus conference 
report on red cell  transfusion^,^^ pa- 
tients often received transfusion(s1 
when the Hb level fell below 10 g per 
dL. However, the conference report 
concluded that patients should be 
given transfusion(s) on the basis of an 
overall assessment of clinical status 
and symptoms rather than a thresh- 
old Hb level, although there are few 
data to support this or any other 
transfusion strategy. Our trial was de- 
signed to document the feasibility of 
testing the clinical strategy suggested 
in the consensus statement and 
evaluate if patients would benefit 
from higher Hb levels. 
The two transfusion strategies 
tested in this trial have an empirical 
and theoretical basis. The rationale 
for the threshold transfusion strategy 
(keeping the postoperative Hb level 
>10 gldL) include the following. 1) A 
recent study of 1958 Jehovah’s Witness 
patients undergoing surgery suggests 
that the risk of mortality and morbid- 
ity begins to increase when the post- 
operative Hb falls below 10 g per dL, 
especially in patients with concomi- 
tant cardiovascular disease.12 2) 
Transfused patients may have more 
“energy” and be better able to get out 
of bed (which reduces the risk of 
pneumonia and thromboembolism) 
and may be able to work harder at re- 
habilitation, which results in better 
functional status, reduced use of 
nursing home, and shorter length of 
hospital stay. 3) Greater oxygen-cany-

ing capacity might result in fewer 
MIS and fewer episodes of congestive 
heart failure. The rationales for the 
symptomatic transfusion strategy are: 
1) a cohort study of 8787 hip fracture 
patients found no apparent effect of 
transfusion on mortality in patients 
with Hb levels as low as 8 g per dL, 
even those with cardiovascular dis- 
easel3; 2) a lower Hb level would re- 
duce blood viscosity, which might 
lower the risk 
of 
fatal 
and 
nonfatal thrombosis resulting in MI, 
stroke, and thromboembolism; 3) less 
blood use would result in lower risk 
of transfusion-related complications, 
such as the immunomodulating ef- 
fect of allogeneic blood, and of rare 
viral infections; and 4) less blood use 
might reduce the risk of transfusion 
complications resulting from human 
errors, such as the use of mismatched 
blood. 
The options for blood manage- 
ment are rapidly expanding and in- 
clude the use of autologous blood do- 
nation, erythropoietin, intraoperative 
hemodilution, and blood substitutes. 
The rationale for the use of each of 
these new treatments is to reduce al- 
logeneic blood transfusion. When we 
have a clearer understanding of how 
to treat patients with allogeneic blood 
transfusions, we will be better able to 
determine the appropriate indica- 
tions for these new blood-manage- 
ment strategies and drugs. 
The results from a definitive trial 
are likely to change RBC transfusion 
practice. If the study shows that blood 
can be safelywithheld until the patient is symptomatic, that 
should lead to more widespread acceptance and use of 
lower transfusion thresholds. Alternatively, if a definitive 
trial demonstrates that higher Hb levels are needed to 
maintain function or reduce mortality (as the trend in this 
analysis showed), then current transfusion guidelines 
would have to be updated. Large, simple, randomized clini- 
cal trials are feasible and are needed to provide a scientific 
basis for transfusion decisions.
