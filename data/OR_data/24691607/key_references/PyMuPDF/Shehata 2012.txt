BACKGROUND: It is important to determine the
optimal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration for red blood
cell (RBC) transfusion for patients undergoing cardiac
surgery because increased mortality has been associ-
ated with the severity of anemia and exposure to RBCs.
Because a deﬁnitive trial will require thousands of
patients, and because there is variability in transfusion
practices, a pilot study was undertaken to determine
adherence to proposed strategies.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center par-
allel randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted in
high-risk cardiac patients to assess adherence to two
transfusion strategies. Fifty patients were randomly
assigned either to a “restrictive” transfusion strategy
(RBCs if their Hb concentration was 70 g/L or less intra-
operatively during cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] and
75 g/L or less postoperatively) or a “liberal” transfusion
strategy (RBCs if their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or
less during CPB and less than 100 g/L postoperatively).
RESULTS: The percentage of adherence overall was
84% in the restrictive arm and 41% in the liberal arm.
Twenty-two (88%) patients were transfused 99 units of
RBCs in the liberal group compared to 13 patients
who were transfused 50 units in the restrictive group
(p < 0.01). There were no signiﬁcant differences in indi-
vidual adverse outcomes; however, more adverse
events occurred in the restrictive group (38 vs. 15,
p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Adherence to the evaluated interven-
tions is vital to all randomized controlled trials as it has
the potential to affect outcomes. Further pilot studies
are required to optimize enrollment and transfusion
adherence before a deﬁnitive study is conducted.
R
ed blood cell (RBC) transfusion rates are high in
cardiac surgery, in part due to the question of
whether these patients require a higher transfu-
sion threshold. However, there is little direct evi-
dence to support this assumption. To date no randomized
controlled trial has assessed the optimal transfusion
threshold or determined the crossover point at which the
risk of acute anemia exceeds that of RBC transfusion in
cardiac surgical patients.
In a retrospective study of seven Canadian centers,
which included 11,812 cardiac surgical patients,1 44% of
patients received one or more RBC units, and the range of
patients transfused was 28% to 60%. In a recent study in

the United States, in 100, 000 patients undergoing primary
elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) the
frequency of RBC transfusion rates ranged from 7.8% to
92.8%.2 Because morbidity and mortality may be depen-
dent
on
the
severity
of
anemia
and
exposure
to
transfusions,3-8 it is essential to determine the optimal
threshold hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at which phy-
sicians should be transfusing these patients, to reduce
morbidity and mortality. This is particularly important
because the efﬁcacy of liberal transfusion has not been
established in cardiac surgical patients and RBC transfu-
sion has been associated with an increased risk of renal
failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI],
1.9-2.3), cardiac complications (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.6),
neurologic events (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.4), and mortality
(OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-1.9).8
Despite the large number of published clinical studies
which have attempted to determine the optimal Hb con-
centration at which to transfuse cardiac surgical patients,
no clear consensus has emerged to guide clinical practice.
Retrospective analyses have demonstrated increased
morbidity and mortality near preoperative Hb values less
than 120 g/L5,9 and at intraoperative Hb values ranging
from 50 to 80 g/L.10,11 Furthermore, patients having car-
diovascular surgery with postoperative hematocrit (Hct)
values of 34% (Hb concentrations of 110 g/L) or higher
appeared to have an increase in morbidity.12 The OR for
myocardial infarction for the group with a Hct of 34% or
higher was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.04-4.76) compared to the group
with a Hct of 24% or less.12 Yet, low Hb concentrations
have also been associated with adverse outcomes. Of
27 patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass sur-
gery,13 six patients who had symptomatic cardiac events
had a Hct level below 28% (a Hb concentration of approxi-
mately 93 g/L).
Because there is a wide range of Hb concentrations
for transfusion, and because anemia and transfusions are
independently associated with morbidity and mortality,
a deﬁnitive study is needed to determine the effect of
anemia. However, barriers to recruitment and adherence
need to be identiﬁed so they can be addressed before a
larger deﬁnitive study.14 Clinical uncertainty resulting
from 1) apprehension about transfusion, 2) concern that
the transfusion thresholds are not consistent with clinical
practice, 3) not knowing which treatment is best, and 4)
the concern that the doctor–patient relationship could be
adversely affected by trial participation have been shown
to be deterrents in previous randomized controlled tri-
als.15,16Therefore, a pilot study is required to determine the
acceptability and feasibility of the transfusion strategies
by physicians and patients because it is anticipated that
enrollment and adherence will be low. The objective of
this study was to determine enrollment and adherence
with a protocol for Hb transfusion strategies in patients
having cardiac surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
A single-center open-labeled parallel randomized con-
trolled pilot trial of two transfusion strategies in patients
having elective cardiac surgery was conducted to deter-
mine enrollment and adherence to Hb concentrations
used
for
transfusion
triggers.
The
randomization
sequence was created using permuted blocks of four
stratiﬁed by age and the Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Score
(CARE) score.17 Opaque sequential sealed envelopes were
used and opened at the start of surgery. The allocation
sequence was generated by an independent statistician
at the Ottawa Methods Centre of the Ottawa Hospital
Research Institute. The research coordinator enrolled
participants and assigned participants to the trans-
fusion strategies. The study was approved by the research
ethics board at St Michael’s Hospital and written in-
formed consent was obtained from all patients before
randomization.
Eligible participants were identiﬁed in the preopera-
tive clinic or hospital ward at St Michael’s Hospital
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) from 2007 to 2010. St Micha-
el’s Hospital is a university-afﬁliated tertiary care center
with approximately 1000 cardiac surgeries conducted
yearly.
Patients were allocated to one of two transfusion
strategies. Patients allocated to a “restrictive” transfusion
strategy received RBC transfusions if their Hb was 70 g/L
or less during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and 75 g/L
or less postoperatively after bypass. Patients allocated to a
“liberal” transfusion strategy received RBC transfusions if
their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or less during and less
than 100 g/L after bypass. A lower Hb concentration for
transfusion was used during CPB because metabolic
demands are reduced during anesthesia and CPB. When a
threshold was reached, each group was to receive 1 unit of
RBCs administered at a time followed by determination of
the Hb concentration. The transfusion protocols were to
be adhered to from beginning of surgery until discharge
from hospital. Patients who had rapid blood loss were
transfused at the discretion of the attending physician. All
other aspects of patient care were left to the discretion of
the attending physicians.
All outcomes were prespeciﬁed. The primary objec-
tive was to assess the enrollment rate and overall adher-
ence to the transfusion strategies. We deﬁned successful
adherence as adherence to the transfusion strategies in
90% of patients in more than 90% of their days in hospital.
Adherence was deﬁned as transfusion of RBCs according
to the Hb threshold.
Secondary outcomes included RBC transfusions,
clinical outcomes, and physiologic indicators of hypox-
emia (mixed venous oxygen saturation). Clinical out-
comes were deﬁned as 1) in-hospital all-cause mortality;

2) a composite score of morbidity consisting of a) neuro-
logic events deﬁned as a new focal neurologic deﬁcit
lasting more than 24 hours or irreversible encephalopathy,
b) dialysis-dependent renal failure or greater than 50%
increase in creatinine, c) prolonged low cardiac output
state (i.e., need for two or more inotropes for 24 hours or
more, intraaortic balloon pump or ventricular assist
device for greater than 48 h), and/or myocardial infarc-
tion, deﬁned as troponin I level greater than 2.5 mg/L and
new Q waves on electrocardiogram or a clinical diagnosis;
and 3) hospital lengths of stay. We assembled an indepen-
dent data safety monitoring board consisting of a cardiac
anesthesiologist and a hematologist who reviewed the
data after 20 patients were recruited.
Study population
Eligible participants were adults patients undergoing
cardiac surgery with a CARE score (a score for cardiac
surgery patients used to predict morbidity and mortality)
of 3 or 4,17 or patients of advanced age deﬁned as greater
than or equal to 80 years on the day of screening were
included. A CARE score of 3 is deﬁned as patients with
uncontrolled medical problems such as unstable angina
treated with intravenous heparin or nitroglycerin, use of a
preoperative intraaortic balloon pump, heart failure with
pulmonary or peripheral edema, uncontrolled hyperten-
sion, renal insufﬁciency (creatinine level greater than
140 mmol/L), debilitating systemic diseases, or patients in
whom a complex surgery is undertaken (i.e., reoperation,
combined valve and coronary artery surgery, multiple
valve surgery, left ventricular aneurysmectomy, repair of
ventricular septal defect after myocardial infarction, or
CABG of diffuse or heavily calciﬁed vessels). A CARE score
of 4 is deﬁned as patients with any uncontrolled medical
problem and in whom a complex surgery is undertaken.17
These patients were selected as transfusion rates in these
individuals are high (e.g., reoperation, combined valve
and coronary artery surgery,18-20 renal insufﬁciency18,21,22).
Patients were excluded if they refused participation, were
unable to receive or refused blood products, or were
involved in the autologous predonation program.
Anesthesia and surgical management
All patients remained on their preoperative medications
as directed until the surgical date. Patients were anesthe-
tized using a narcotic (1-2 mg/kg sufentanil or 10-20 mg/kg
fentanyl), a benzodiazepine (0.1-0.15 mg/kg midazolam),
0.2% to 1.5% isoﬂurane, and/or 50-100 mg/kg/min propo-
fol, with muscle relaxation provided from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg
rocuronium or 0.15 mg/kg pancuronium. Heparin was
given to maintain an activated clotting time of more than
420 seconds during CPB. Bypass management included
nonpulsatile pump ﬂow of 2.4 ¥ body surface area, mean
arterial pressure 55 to 85 mmHg, temperature 33 to 35°C,
and blood sugar 4 to 10 mmol/L. Myocardial protection
was achieved with cold blood crystalloid cardioplegia, and
a “hot-shot” (250 to 500 mL) was delivered just before the
removal of the aortic cross-clamp. After separation from
CPB, heparin was reversed with protamine (approx.
10 mg/1000 units of heparin) to normalize the activated
clotting time. Postoperatively, patients were managed in a
specialized cardiovascular intensive care unit with stan-
dardized protocols for early extubation (2-4 hr). Intraop-
erative use of antiﬁbrinolytic agents and cell salvage are
routinely used at the study site and were used at the dis-
cretion of the surgical team.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables were described as mean (standard
deviation [SD]) or medians (with interquartile range [IQR])
if the data were not normally distributed. Categorical vari-
ablesweredescribedasnumbersandpercentages.Weana-
lyzed adherence rates and also examined the effect of the
transfusion strategies on the clinical outcomes using
univariate analysis, t test, and Mann-Whitney U test for
continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical
variables (or the Fisher’s exact test if the expected number
in any cell was less than 5).The signiﬁcance level was set at
a p value of less than 0.05 for all statistical analyses. All
analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis.
A total sample size of 50 patients was estimated to
produce a 97.5% CI equal to the sample adherence preva-
lence plus or minus 8% when the true prevalence of
adherence was hypothesized to be 90%. Therefore, 25
patients were randomized to the restrictive group and 25
patients were randomized to the liberal group. We esti-
mated our sample size using computer software (PASS
2002, NCSS, Kaysville, UT).
RESULTS
A ﬂow diagram for the 50 patients recruited in this study
demonstrated that a high percentage of individuals were
not eligible and a considerable proportion declined part-
icipation in the study (Fig. 1). Enrollment rate was less
than 1%.
The characteristics of the patients according to allo-
cation group are listed in Table 1. There were no signiﬁ-
cant differences between the groups with regard to age,
height, weight, and comorbid illnesses. Intraoperatively,
the duration of CPB and cross-clamping were similar for
both groups as were the volume of estimated intraopera-
tive blood loss and the number of attempts to separate
from CPB. Seventy-two percent of patients in the restric-
tive group and 68% of patients in the liberal group were
using antiplatelet (PLT) medications before surgery. Anti-
PLT medications tended to be discontinued earlier in the

restrictive group than the liberal group but this difference
did not achieve signiﬁcance (median 5 days, IQR 6 days vs.
median 1 day, IQR 7 days; p = 0.9). Twenty-eight percent of
patients in the restrictive group and 32% of patients in the
liberal group were taking anticoagulants preoperatively.
All patients received antiﬁbrinolytics except one patient in
the restrictive group. Two patients in the restrictive group
received aprotinin.
Overall, 13 patients were transfused 50 units in the
restrictive group compared to 22 (88%) patients who were
transfused 99 units of RBCs in the liberal group (p < 0.01
for the number of units transfused). Intraoperatively, 14
RBC units were transfused to the restrictive group com-
pared to 48 units of RBCs administered to the liberal group
(p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). Table 2 illustrates the proportion of
patients transfused RBCs, plasma, and PLTs.
Table 3 illustrates the adherence data. The median
number of days of adherence to the transfusion strategy
was 8 days (IQR, 12 days) in the restrictive arm and 6 days
(IQR, 3 days) in the liberal arm (p = 0.04). Adherence was
calculated as the proportion of triggers that resulted in
transfusions administered according to the transfusion
strategy (i.e., below the Hb transfusion threshold attained
and patient was transfused/transfusion threshold attained
for all patients). RBC units transfused for excessive bleed-
ing were not included in the calculation of adherence data
as the protocol was suspended if a patient was rapidly
bleeding. If 2 units of RBCs were trans-
fused after one Hb measurement, the
ﬁrst unit was considered adherent if
the Hb threshold was attained; however,
the second unit was not considered
adherent because only one RBC unit
was to be transfused for each trigger
attained. The adherence table (Table 3)
also does not include data for units
transfused in the absence of a known Hb
concentration. For patients allocated to
the restrictive strategy, adherence was
69% in the operating room, 82% in the
intensive care unit, and 100% on the
ward. For the liberal group, adherence
was 40% in the operating room, 69% in
the intensive care unit, and 14% on
the ward. There were 10 RBC units in the
restrictive group and 3 units in the
liberal group that were transfused in
the absence of a Hb transfusion thresh-
old being attained. Thus adherence
overall was 84% in the restrictive group
and 41% in the liberal group. Reasons for
nonadherence included patient refusal,

planning to repeat the complete blood count before trans-
fusing the patient, and the perfusionist being occupied.
The rationale for nonadherence was not well described for
the remainder of the transfusions.
The mean Hb concentrations were similar preopera-
tively but after surgery the Hb concentrations began to
diverge (Fig. 2). The differences in Hb concentration
increased as the hospital stay increased (p < 0.01). The
mean Hb concentration on Day 6 for the restrictive group
was
91.1 g/L
and
for
the
liberal
group
107.0 g/L
(p = 0.0004).
The mixed venous oxygen saturation was measured
in some patients (11 patients in the liberal group and four
patients in the restrictive group) with a pulmonary artery
catheter as a sign of tissue hypoxia (Fig. 4). There were no
differences in the mixed venous oxygen saturation before
or after RBC transfusion in the restrictive or liberal group.
We did not detect signiﬁcant differences in any of the
adverse outcomes (Table 4); however, the total number of
adverse events was 38 (including death) in the restrictive
strategy group compared to 15 in the liberal strategy (OR,
6.4; 95% CI, 2.8-14.9). There were four deaths in the
restrictive group and one in the liberal group. In the
restrictive strategy, one patient died of respiratory failure
secondary to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pul-
monary edema; two patients died from septic shock; and
one patient had a cerebrovascular accident. The cause of
death of the patient in the liberal group was cardiogenic
shock.
DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst randomized controlled trial in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery to focus on adherence rates to
transfusion strategies in a patient population where there
is variability in transfusion practice and clinical equipoise
in selecting transfusion thresholds. The trend for reduced
adherence in the liberal group suggests an unproven bias
that cardiac surgery patients require lower thresholds
which may have the potential to inﬂuence practice and
study outcomes. The importance of the determination of
adherence rates to transfusion strategies cannot be under-
stated because adherence rates can affect outcomes if a
considerable proportion of patients do not receive a trans-
fusion according to their transfusion strategy. Experimen-
tal data can be difﬁcult to interpret if a high proportion of
patients do not receive transfusion according to the trans-
fusion threshold or if patients only receive a transfusion
during presumed critical periods of reduced oxygen
supply, that is, intraoperatively and in the intensive care
unit. Adherence to transfusion strate-
gies should occur throughout the entire
hospital stay since changes in trans-
fusion practice may impact patient
outcomes regardless of when the trans-
fusion was received in the periope-
rative period. There is evidence that
preoperative and intraoperative anemia
and transfusion are associated with
increased adverse events and length of
stay, and adverse events are increased
by the number of RBC transfusions.6,23,24

izability of results.25 Only a minority of patients are
included in randomized controlled trials—28% of patients
assessed in TRACS were included in that study.26
For both strategies there was a lower than accepted
adherence rate. The low proportion of adherence on the
ward in the liberal group could confound a study of trans-
fusion. The lack of adherence likely reﬂects the preference
for a restrictive transfusion strategy at our hospital and
patient preference due to educational information admin-
istered to them about the risks of transfusion during hos-
pitalization. These adherence rates are lower than we had
anticipated and reﬂects the challenges of conducting
studies in transfusion medicine in this patient population
that need to be surmounted. For example, as a result of this
study we will revise our consent form to highlight the
potential risk of not receiving a transfusion and the uncer-
tainty for the need of transfusion. In addition, the lack of
adherence also reﬂects how adherence is deﬁned and
calculated.
Although not our primary outcome, patients allo-
cated to a lower Hb concentration experienced more
adverse events. This occurred despite a lack of signiﬁcant
difference in the mixed venous oxygen saturation. It has
been well established that reduction in mixed venous
oxygen saturation is a poor surrogate of focal tissue
hypoxia as focal reductions in vital organs have been dem-
onstrated in the absence of changes in venous satura-
tion.27 In addition, the pilot study was not powered to
detect a difference in the mixed venous oxygen saturation.
Nonetheless, the higher frequency of adverse events
potentially related to tissue oxygen delivery suggests that
further research is needed to determine if patients with
high-risk features may beneﬁt from higher Hb concentra-
tions for transfusion.
Although the TRACS study did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
difference in mortality between a Hb concentration of
80 g/L compared to 100 g/L, the trial was not powered to
do so. Because mortality rates in cardiac surgery are low,
thousands of patients would need to be recruited for mor-
tality as a primary outcome.25 TRACS did ﬁnd a trend to an
increased risk of cardiogenic shock in patients random-
ized to a Hb concentration of 80 g/L. There was also a
suggestion that mortality may be increased in the restric-
tive group because the hazard ratio for mortality, although
not signiﬁcant, was 1.28 (95% CI, 0.60-2.73); and the mor-
tality rate from Day 18 to Day 28 was approximately 3% for
the liberal strategy but 5% for the restrictive strategy,
which would be a clinically important difference.25
There are a few limitations to this study. The enroll-
ment rate was low; however, considering that patients are
sensitized to the risk of transfusion before surgery and
there were several competing studies, these results are not
unexpected. Future studies need to stress the importance
of determining the transfusion thresholds and the lack of
scientiﬁc evidence to support institutional transfusion
thresholds in this population. The adherence rates on the
ward were lower than anticipated, likely due to the percep-
tion that most adverse events secondary to hypoxia would
be anticipated to occur in the operating room or in the
intensive care unit. This study was a pilot study and the

resultant low adherence data can direct investigators in
future trials to provide appropriate education materials to
all individuals who participate in transfusion of these
patients to ensure adherence to transfusion strategies.This
study included patients with high-risk features and there-
fore cannot be applied to all patients. The rationale for the
selection of this population was that this population would
more likely receive a transfusion because of a higher risk of
organ injury and because they are a group that would most
likely derive a beneﬁt from the transfusion. Selecting a
homogenous population potentially also ensures compa-
rability.28 The choice of triggers and range of Hb concen-
trations selected reﬂect 1) the values studied in the trans-
fusion triggers in critical care trial;29 2) the need to have a
sufﬁcient range difference between strategies so as to have
the potential to inﬂuence outcomes; 3) representative
values within the margin of clinical practice as established
by surveys, variation studies, and clinical guidelines;30 4)
ranges perceived to be safe by the investigators and experts
in the ﬁeld;31,32 and 5) the clinical uncertainty of optimum
Hb concentrations for transfusion.33-37
Future studies of transfusion thresholds should
include
detailed
information
about
enrollment
and
adherence rates. Adherence rates and the proportion of
individuals satisfying these adherence rates should be
reported for the entire hospitalization. An 80% adherence
rate is acceptable as previous reports have attained this
adherence rate,27,30 albeit not for the entire hospitaliza-
tion. By achieving this adherence rate a deﬁnitive study
that will require at least 2000 patients can be completed
and used to guide clinical practice.
This study identiﬁed barriers to enrollment and
recruitment so that methods to overcome these barriers
can be incorporated in future studies to
improve enrollment and recruitment
rates. By addressing uncertainty sur-
rounding transfusion thresholds and
overtransfusion, future studies may be
completed in a timely fashion. However,
additional pilot studies need to be con-
ducted to ensure enrollment and adher-
ence before a deﬁnitive randomized
controlled trial is conducted.
This pilot study demonstrated that
there are physician and patient biases
for transfusion thresholds and that there
is a need for knowledge translation. The
pilot study also demonstrated that the
adherence rates were sufﬁcient in the
operating room and intensive care unit
to separate Hb concentrations. Studies
assessing transfusion strategies should
report adherence rates because adher-
ence reﬂects the proportion of patients
transfused according to the transfusion
strategy and therefore compliance. Adherence will affect
the interpretation of outcomes if a high proportion of
patients are not transfused according to the strategy. This
study and the TRACS study highlight the need for a large
multicentered collaborative study to address transfusion
requirements in this patient population.
