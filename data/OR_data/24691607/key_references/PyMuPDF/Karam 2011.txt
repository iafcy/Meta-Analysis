S
evere sepsis and septic shock
are major healthcare prob-
lems, both in adults and chil-
dren (1–4). Because the patho-
physiology of sepsis and septic shock
involves decreased oxygen delivery, myo-
cardial dysfunction, and mitochondrial
depression, a therapeutic goal frequently
advocated for these patients is to insure
adequate oxygen delivery by optimizing
their cardiac output and hemoglobin
level (5).
It is frequently stated by intensivists
that critically ill patients with sepsis re-
quire a higher hemoglobin level. In two
surveys (6, 7) addressing this issue, pedi-
atric intensivists replied that they prefer
to maintain a high hemoglobin concen-
tration in children with sepsis requiring
intensive care and that sepsis would
prompt them to administer red blood cell
(RBC) transfusions at a higher hemoglo-
bin threshold. In a landmark randomized
clinical trial, Rivers et al (5) studied the
efﬁcacy of goal-directed therapy in adults
with severe sepsis before they were stabi-
lized and reported an improved outcome
if the central venous oxygen saturation
was maintained at 70% in the ﬁrst 6 hrs
after presentation; RBC transfusions were
among the proposed means to reach a
central venous oxygen saturation of 70%.
The 2008 guidelines from the Surviv-
ing Sepsis Campaign recommend that
adults with sepsis with low venous oxy-
gen saturation during the ﬁrst 6 hrs of
treatment should undergo transfusion to
target a hematocrit 30%. Once tissue
hypoperfusion is resolved, the guidelines
propose that the hemoglobin level be
maintained between 7.0 and 9.0 g/dL;
RBC transfusion is recommended if the
hemoglobin decreases to 7.0 g/dL
(8, 9). The previous version of the Sur-
viving Sepsis guidelines in 2004 (10) rec-
ommended that the hemoglobin concen-
tration be kept within the normal range
for age in children with severe sepsis and
septic shock (10 g/dL); no speciﬁc rec-
ommendation was made for children in
the more recently published guidelines
(8). There is almost no evidence-based
data on which to base recommendations
regarding the optimal hemoglobin level
for critically ill children with severe sep-
sis (10).
In 2007, Lacroix et al (11) published a
large randomized controlled trial com-
paring a transfusion threshold of 7.0 g/dL
and 9.5 g/dL in stabilized critically ill
children and provided evidence that the
lower threshold of 7.0 g/dL was safe in
this patient population. In the present
subgroup analysis, we compare the effect
of restrictive and liberal transfusion strat-
egies on multiple organ dysfunction and

Objectives: In children with severe sepsis or septic shock, the
optimal red blood cell transfusion threshold is unknown. We ana-
lyzed the subgroup of patients with sepsis and transfusion require-
ments in a pediatric intensive care unit study to determine the impact
of a restrictive vs. liberal transfusion strategy on clinical outcome.
Design: Subgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter, ran-
domized, controlled trial.
Setting: Multicenter pediatric critical care units.
Patients: Stabilized critically ill children (mean systemic arterial
pressure >2 SD below normal mean for age and cardiovascular support
not increased for at least 2 hrs before enrollment) with a hemoglobin
<9.5 g/dL within 7 days after pediatric critical care unit admission.
Interventions: One hundred thirty-seven stabilized critically ill
children with sepsis were randomized to receive red blood cell
transfusion if their hemoglobin decreased to either <7.0 g/dL
(restrictive group) or 9.5 g/dL (liberal group).
Measurements and Main Results: In the restrictive group (69
patients), 30 patients did not receive any red blood cell transfusion,
whereas only one patient in the liberal group (68 patients) never
underwent transfusion (p < .01). No clinically signiﬁcant differences
were found for the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ
dysfunction syndrome (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p  .97), for pediatric
critical care unit length of stay (p  .74), or for pediatric critical care
unit mortality (p  .44) in the restrictive vs. liberal group.
Conclusions: In this subgroup analysis of children with stable
sepsis, we found no evidence that a restrictive red cell transfusion
strategy, as compared to a liberal one, increased the rate of new
or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Further-
more, a restrictive transfusion threshold signiﬁcantly reduced
exposure to blood products. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin
level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe stabilized for children with sepsis,
but further studies are required to support this recommendation.

adverse outcome in critically ill stabilized
children with sepsis or septic shock.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protocol. A detailed description of the
transfusion requirements in pediatric inten-
sive care units (TRIPICU) results was previ-
ously reported (11). Brieﬂy, the TRIPICU study
enrolled stabilized critically ill children from
19 tertiary care pediatric intensive care units
(PICUs) from four countries. Institutional re-
view boards approved the study protocol, and
parental consent was obtained. The condition
of patients was considered stable if the mean
systemic arterial pressure was not 2 SD below
the normal mean for age and if cardiovascular
support (ﬂuid, vasoactive, and inotropic
drugs) had not been increased for at least 2 hrs
before enrollment. Once stabilized, children
aged between 3 days and 14 yrs, with at least
one hemoglobin concentration 9.5 g/dL
within the ﬁrst 7 days after PICU admission,
were considered for inclusion. TRIPICU study
exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.
Participants were randomly allocated to
restrictive or liberal treatment arms. In the
restrictive group, the transfusion threshold
was hemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL, with a target
range after transfusion between 8.5 and 9.5
g/dL; in the liberal group, the threshold was
9.5 g/dL, with a target range of 11.0 to 12.0
g/dL. Only pre-storage leukocyte-reduced al-
logeneic RBC units were used. Transfusion
strategies were applied until intensive care
unit discharge, 28 days after randomization,
or until the time of death, whichever came
ﬁrst. Temporary suspensions from the pro-
tocol were allowed during active blood loss,
emergency surgery, severe hypoxemia, or
hemodynamic instability.
The primary outcome was the proportion
of patients with development of or progression
of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes
(MODS) after randomization. MODS was de-
ﬁned by Proulx et al (1), and new or progres-
sive MODS was deﬁned by Lacroix et al (11).
New MODS was considered if a patient with no
organ dysfunction or one organ dysfunction at
randomization developed two or more organs
during the study. Progressive MODS was con-
sidered if a patient who already had MODS
(dysfunction of at least two organs) at ran-
domization had dysfunction of at least one
other organ during the study. The secondary
outcomes included nosocomial infections
(12), mortality, duration of mechanical venti-
lation, and PICU length of stay.
Assignment. Randomization for the TRIPICU
trial was centralized, with assignment data
posted on the Internet. Patients were assigned
to the study groups in blocks of two or four
that were randomly distributed and stratiﬁed
according to center and three age groups (28
days or younger, 29 to 364 days, and older
than 364 days). Physicians, nurses, and re-
search staff were unaware of the block ran-
domization strategy.
Blinding Procedures. The TRIPICU study
was not blinded because this was not feasible.
Clinical staff and parents were aware of the
assignments to study groups (presence of
blood bag at the bedside, increase in hemoglo-
bin level after transfusion), but the statistician
and members of the data and safety monitor-
ing committee were unaware of the assign-
ments.
Subgroup Study. The present study is a
subgroup analysis of septic patients enrolled
in the TRIPICU study. This subgroup analysis
was planned before the TRIPICU study was
started. Expected direction (noninferiority) of
results was stated before this subgroup analy-
sis began.
Systemic inﬂammatory response syn-
drome (SIRS) was deﬁned by the presence of
at least two of the following criteria: (1) tem-
perature 38°C rectal or 36°C rectal; (2)
heart rate 2 SD for age; (3) tachypnea with a
respiratory rate 2 SD for age; and (4) white
blood cell count 12  109/L (12,000 cells/
mm3) or 4  109/L (4,000 cells/mm3) or
10% immature neutrophils. Sepsis was de-
ﬁned as a systemic inﬂammatory response
syndrome caused by an infection (positive cul-
ture from any site or clinical evidence of in-
fection or both). Severe sepsis was deﬁned as
sepsis with Glasgow score 15, serum lactate
level above normal, or low urine output (1
mL/kg/hr for 2 hrs). Septic shock was de-
ﬁned as severe sepsis with hypotension (blood
pressure 2 SD for age) or need for inotropic
or vasopressor agents (1, 13). Sepsis, severe
sepsis, and septic shock are deﬁned according
to Bone et al (13); categories are mutually
exclusive and the most severe was attributed
to each patient.
Statistical Analysis. Continuous variables
were compared using Student t test or Wil-
coxon rank sum test; categorical variables
were analyzed using chi-square testing. Base-
line characteristics were compared using uni-
variate descriptive statistics. Descriptive sta-
tistics are reported as mean 
SD or as
numbers and proportions.
It was estimated that at least 626 patients
would be required to complete the original
TRIPICU study to test a noninferiority hypoth-
esis (p  .05; power of 0.9; margin of safety,
higher 95% CI of absolute risk reduction of
10%). The present subgroup analysis involved
137 septic patients and the statistical analyses
tested noninferiority in a manner similar to
that in the original study (11). Statistical anal-
ysis of the primary outcome measure was con-
ducted using an intent-to-treat approach; for
this analysis, we calculated 95% conﬁdence
intervals around the absolute risk reduction in
the proportion of patients with new or pro-
gressive MODS.
All secondary analyses were conducted us-
ing an intent-to-treat approach. We compared
daily pediatric logistic organ dysfunction
scores, using the worst scores after baseline,
and the total number of organ dysfunctions
per patient. We also compared 28-day and hos-
pital all-cause mortality, nosocomial infec-
tions, transfusion reactions, duration of me-
chanical ventilation, and PICU and hospital
length of stay. To determine whether a restric-
tive transfusion strategy decreased exposure to
RBCs, we compared the total number of trans-
Figure 1. Enrollment and outcomes. Some patients had more than one exclusion criterion. In addition
to the causes listed for exclusion, other causes were a postconception age of less than 40 wks (69
patients), severe thrombocytopenia (68), hypoxemia (65), a decision to withhold or withdraw critical
care (59), predicted survival of 24 hrs (54), previous enrollment in the study (33), brain death (25),
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (22), hemoﬁltration (21), blood exchange transfusion (20),
plasmapheresis (17), an inability to receive blood products (14), and pregnancy (1).

fusions per patient and the proportion of pa-
tients who did not receive RBC transfusions in
the two groups.
Differences were considered statistically
signiﬁcant when a two-sided  level was
0.05. No adjustments were made for multi-
ple comparisons. Data were analyzed by a bio-
statistician (T.D.) with SAS software (version
9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Patients at Admission and at Ran-
domization. There were 137 septic pa-
tients enrolled from 19 sites and four
countries in the septic patients subgroup,
representing 21.5% of all TRIPICU pa-
tients: 69 were randomized to the restric-
tive group and 68 were randomized to the
liberal group (Fig. 1). Table 1 describes
patient characteristics on PICU admis-
sion. Both groups were similar with re-
gard to demographic data, severity of (as
measured by the Pediatric Risk of Mortal-
ity score) (14) and proportion requiring
mechanical ventilation. There were fewer
patients with septic shock in the restric-
tive compared to the liberal group (13
[19%] vs. 21 [31%]); this difference was
not statistically signiﬁcant (p  .32). Ta-
ble 2 describes patient characteristics at
randomization, which occurred 2.3  1.7
days after entry into PICU. Severity of
illness and need for mechanical ventila-
tion were similar in both groups.
Intervention. The baseline hemoglo-
bin concentration at randomization was
7.9  1.0 in the restrictive group and
7.8  0.9 g/dL in the liberal group. Time
between randomization and ﬁrst transfu-
sion was 1.3  2.1 days in the restrictive
group vs. 0.2  0.4 days in the liberal
group (p  .001) (Table 3). As expected,
the hemoglobin level before the ﬁrst
transfusion was signiﬁcantly lower in the
restrictive group (6.6  0.5 vs. 7.9  0.9
g/dL; p  .01), as well as the lowest he-
moglobin level after randomization
(8.3  1.1 vs. 10.6  1.7 g/dL; p  .01).
Overall, in the restrictive group, 30
patients (44%) did not receive any RBC
transfusion, whereas only one patient
(1%) in the liberal group did not undergo
transfusion (p  .01). The median vol-
ume transfused was 7.6 vs. 15.7 mL/kg,
respectively (p  .01).
Storage time of the transfused RBC
units was similar in both the liberal and
restrictive groups (14.3  8.3 days vs.
15.6  8.6 days, respectively). Eleven pa-
tients in the restrictive and six in the
liberal group (p  .96) were temporarily
suspended from the transfusion protocol.
Length of suspension in the restrictive
group and liberal group was 6.7  7.7
and 2.3  2.0 days, respectively. Cointer-
ventions, including requirement for vaso-
active drugs (proportion of patients re-
ceiving
at
least
one
drug),
and
administration of fresh-frozen plasma,
platelets, and albumin were similar in
both groups.
Primary Outcome
Thirteen patients in the restrictive
group and 13 in the liberal group had
new or progressive MODS after random-
ization (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p  .97) (Ta-
ble 4). In this subgroup analysis, the ab-
solute risk reduction was 0.3%, whereas
it was 0.4% in the original study; the 95%
conﬁdence interval (12.8% to 13.4%)
was outside the 10% margin of safety
agreed on for the original study. There
were no differences among the 17 pa-
tients who were temporarily suspended
from the transfusion protocol, with the
primary outcome being present in eight
(72%) vs. ﬁve (67%) patients (p  .56).
Secondary Outcomes
There were no clinically signiﬁcant
differences in any of the measures of or-
gan dysfunction analyzed (Table 4), in-
cluding oxygenation markers and dura-
tion of mechanical ventilation. There
were 12 cases (17%) of nosocomial infec-
tions in the restrictive group compared to
23 (34%) in the liberal group (p  .02).
There were no differences in the total
PICU length of stay (13.2  8.1 vs. 13.4 
8.4 days; p  .74) and in the PICU length
of stay after randomization (7.5  6.3 vs.
7.1  6.2 days; p  .74). There were ﬁve
deaths in the restrictive group and two in
the liberal group in the PICU (p  .44).
Two additional patients died in the re-
strictive group after PICU discharge but
within 28 days after randomization (p 
.08).
DISCUSSION
In this subgroup analysis of septic pa-
tients enrolled in the TRIPICU trial, an
equal number of patients had new or pro-
gressive MODS in both transfusion strat-
egy groups. Furthermore, there were no
meaningful differences for any of the sec-
ondary outcomes analyzed. These results
suggest that a restrictive transfusion
threshold of 7.0 g/dL may be safe for
hemodynamically stabilized septic pa-
tients admitted to the PICU, and that the
outcome for this particular subgroup of
patients was similar to that of other pa-
tients in the TRIPICU trial.
In the Surviving Sepsis campaign pub-
lished in 2008, the recommended trans-
fusion strategy for septic adult patients
with low central venous oxygen satura-
tion, who are considered to have tissue
hypoperfusion and therefore are to be un-
stable, is to maintain a hematocrit level
30%; once stabilized, the recom-
mended target hemoglobin level is 7.0–
9.0 g/dL. The previous version of Surviv-

ing Sepsis published in 2004 stated that
“the optimal hemoglobin for a critically
ill child with severe sepsis is not known”
and made no recommendations regard-
ing the triggers (10). In the 2008 version
of these guidelines, it is stated that “it is
still unclear whether a lower transfusion
trigger is safe or appropriate during the
initial resuscitation of children with sep-
tic shock” and again made no recommen-
dations for a hemoglobin threshold for
RBC transfusion (8). In the present study,
children with sepsis were evaluated once
they were considered stabilized. The lat-
ter deﬁnition required that patients have
a mean systemic arterial pressure not 2
SD below the normal mean for age and no
increase in any cardiovascular treatment
(ﬂuids, vasoactive, and inotropic drugs)
for at least 2 hrs before enrollment. Al-
though this cohort of patients with sepsis
did not include the most severely ill chil-
dren with sepsis because TRIPICU exclu-
sion criteria did not allow for their inclu-
sion if unstable, it nonetheless suggests
that a lower transfusion threshold may be
safe for children with sepsis once stabi-
lized (after the initial resuscitation
phase). In addition, we found that a re-
strictive strategy resulted in a two-fold
reduction in the number of septic pa-
tients who received a transfusion, as well
as a two-fold reduction in the median
volume and number of RBC transfusions,
resulting in a signiﬁcant reduction in ex-
posure to blood products.
The treatment of septic patients re-
quires optimization of oxygen delivery
and utilization by tissues to minimize
cellular dysfunction. RBC transfusion is
administered to increase the oxygen
content of arterial blood and oxygen
delivery to tissues; however, increasing
global oxygen delivery does not always
improve oxygen consumption (15–17). In
sepsis and septic shock, it is well estab-
lished that microcirculatory dysfunction
and mitochondrial depression occur de-
spite adequate global oxygen delivery, re-
sulting in regional hypoxia and oxygen
extraction deﬁcit. Microcirculatory dys-
function is characterized by heteroge-
neous abnormalities in blood ﬂow, with
some capillaries being underperfused,
whereas others have normal to abnor-
mally high blood ﬂow. Sakr et al (18)
have demonstrated that patients with
septic shock had abnormal small vessel
perfusion initially, which improved over
time only in survivors. Similarly, Trze-
ciak et al (19) have shown that early mi-
crocirculatory perfusion indices in severe

sepsis and septic shock are more mark-
edly impaired in nonsurvivors compared
to survivors and are associated with in-
creasing severity of global cardiovascular
dysfunction. In addition, Brealey et al
(20) showed that mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion is correlated with a less favorable
outcome in sepsis. Both microcirculatory
anomalies and mitochondrial dysfunction
lead to the inability to increase oxygen
consumption, which cannot be immedi-
ately improved with RBC transfusion be-
cause of the changes that occur during
the storage process. Stored RBC units
have decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
and S-nitrosohemoglobin levels, which
cause abnormal vasodilatory responses to
hypoxemia and mismatch between local
oxygen delivery through small vessels
and O2 requirements in tissues (21, 22).
Stored RBCs are less deformable (23),
contain more extracellular ubiquitin (24)
and advanced glycation end products
(25), express more phosphatidylserine
(26), and induce more cytokine produc-
tion (27) and secretory phospholipase A2
(28). All these changes are known to have
immunologic or pro-coagulant proper-
ties, which may further contribute to the
inability of RBC transfusion to rapidly
increase tissue oxygen consumption in
critically ill patients.
Besides uncertainty with regard to im-
provement of oxygen consumption, there
are several other issues associated with
transfusion of any blood product that re-
quire consideration. The risks associated
with RBC transfusion are well established
and include acute transfusion reactions
(29, 30) and infectious disease transmis-
sion (31); some studies even suggesting
an increased incidence rate of MODS,
morbidity, and mortality (32–34). In this
study, we found that a restrictive trans-
fusion strategy resulted in a two-fold re-
duction in both the number of patients
undergoing transfusion and the median
volume transfused. Almost all patients
(99%) in the liberal group received a
transfusion compared to only 56% of
those in the restrictive strategy group.
Thus, a restrictive transfusion strategy
allowed a signiﬁcant reduction in RBC
transfusion and its inherent risks without
increasing the rate of new or progressive
MODS, mortality, or any other MODS de-
scriptor.
Interestingly, our data also showed
that patients in the liberal group had
signiﬁcantly more nosocomial infections
than those in the restrictive group (23 vs.
12 cases; p  .02). Whereas other studies
have show that RBC transfusions are as-
sociated with increased nosocomial infec-
tions (33, 35, 36), there was only a trend
in the initial TRIPICU study. This might
be explained by a combined effect of
transfusions and septic state, a hypothe-
sis supported by data suggesting that pre-
existing infections and RBC transfusions
are independently associated with noso-
comial infections (37). One hypothesis
could be that sepsis induces an immuno-
modulation that renders the patient more
prone to contract transfusion-associated
nosocomial infections.
Certain limitations in our study must
be recognized. First, it could be argued
that the patients included in TRIPICU
were stabilized and therefore did not have
the most severe cases of sepsis and septic
shock, because patients had to have a
mean systemic arterial pressure 2 SD
below the normal mean for age and no
increase in cardiovascular support (ﬂuid,
vasoactive, and inotropic drugs) for at
least 2 hrs before enrollment. However,
our cohort of septic patients was none-
theless quite ill, and half of them re-
quired inotropic or vasopressor support
or both, and 90% had respiratory dys-
function. Second, because the TRIPICU
trial protocol was written in 2000, the
deﬁnitions of sepsis, severe sepsis, and
septic shock used were based on the 1992
deﬁnitions of the American College of
Chest Physicians (13), which were
adapted for the pediatric population by
Proulx et al (1), and not the more recent
2001 deﬁnitions (38). Nevertheless, the
two sets of deﬁnitions are quite similar,
because the 2001 deﬁnitions use the def-
inition for organ dysfunctions in children
cited by Proulx et al. Third, the deaths
during PICU stay and at 28 days were not
signiﬁcantly different between both
groups, but these results should be inter-
preted cautiously because the number of
deaths was low. Nevertheless, no other
secondary outcome measuring morbidity

was different between the two groups,
and this further supports the ﬁndings
with regard to mortality. Fourth, the in-
vestigators and members of the Canadian
Critical Care Trials Group had a priori
considered the following as a statistically
signiﬁcant result for the original TRI-
PICU noninferiority trial: a higher 95%
conﬁdence interval for the absolute risk
reduction that is lower than a 10% mar-
gin of safety when comparing the propor-
tion of patients with new or progressive
MODS in the restrictive and liberal
group. The 95% conﬁdence interval of
12.8% does not conﬁrm a noninferior-
ity hypothesis, which is likely attributable
to the fact that this subgroup analysis is
underpowered to attain statistical signif-
icance. Finally, the most important limi-
tations of our study are the pitfalls inher-
ent to any subgroup analysis that
preclude the possibility of generating de-
ﬁnitive conclusions and, at best, allow for
hypothesis generation only (39). Hence,
no deﬁnitive recommendations regarding
transfusion thresholds in stabilized chil-
dren with sepsis can be made. It is none-
theless striking that the frequency of the
primary outcome in the two transfusion
groups was similar.
To our knowledge, there are no other
studies that have prospectively evaluated
the safety of a restrictive transfusion
strategy in septic patients. Furthermore,
it has been shown that there are signiﬁ-
cant variations in transfusion practice
patterns among pediatric critical care
practitioners with respect to the thresh-
old hemoglobin concentration for RBC
transfusion in critically ill septic patients
(6, 33). Therefore, the results reported in
this article are important, even though it
is a subgroup analysis. Our results are
certainly generalizable because the pop-
ulation is representative of North Ameri-
can and European centers. Furthermore,
the trial was pragmatic, allowing for sus-
pension from the study protocol for unsta-
ble patients and therefore reﬂecting real-
life clinical situations of critically ill
patients. The strength of these ﬁndings is
enhanced by the excellent adherence to the
research protocol (nearly 99% of patients
in the TRIPICU study met the 80% adher-
ence criterion), by the fact that no patient
was lost to follow-up, and by the remark-
able similarity of the results reported in the
overall TRIPICU study and two other sub-
group analyses of cardiac surgery (40) and
general surgery patients (41).
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, in this subgroup anal-
ysis of children with stable sepsis, we
found no evidence that a restrictive red
cell transfusion strategy, as compared to
a liberal one, increased the rate of new or
progressive MODS. Furthermore, a re-
strictive transfusion threshold signiﬁ-
cantly reduced exposure to blood prod-
ucts. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin
level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe for children
with stabilized sepsis, but further studies
are required to support this recommen-
dation.
