Objective To assess the effect of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion
on quality of life in acutely anaemic women after postpartum
haemorrhage.
Design Randomised non-inferiority trial.
Setting Thirty-seven Dutch university and general hospitals.
Population Women with acute anaemia (haemoglobin 4.8–7.9 g/dl
[3.0–4.9 mmol/l] 12–24 hours postpartum) without severe
anaemic symptoms or severe comorbidities.
Methods Women
were
allocated
to
RBC
transfusion
or
non-intervention.
Main outcome measures Primary outcome was physical fatigue
3 days postpartum (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory, scale 4–20;
20 represents maximal fatigue). Non-inferiority was demonstrated if
the physical fatigue difference between study arms was maximal 1.3.
Secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life and physical
complications. Health-related quality of life questionnaires were
completed at ﬁve time-points until 6 weeks postpartum.
Results In all, 521 women were randomised to non-intervention
(n = 262) or RBC transfusion (n = 259). Mean physical fatigue
score at day 3 postpartum, adjusted for baseline and mode of
delivery, was 0.8 lower in the RBC transfusion arm (95%
conﬁdence interval: 0.1–1.5, P = 0.02) and at 1 week postpartum
was 1.06 lower (95% conﬁdence interval: 0.3–1.8, P = 0.01). A
median of two RBC units was transfused in the RBC transfusion
arm. In the non-intervention arm, 33 women received RBC
transfusion, mainly because of anaemic symptoms. Physical
complications were comparable.
Conclusions Statistically, non-inferiority could not be demonstrated
as the conﬁdence interval crossed the non-inferiority boundary.
Nevertheless, with only a small difference in physical fatigue and no
differences in secondary outcomes, implementation of restrictive
management seems clinically justiﬁed.
Keywords Anaemia, blood transfusion, postpartum haemorrhage,
quality of life.

Introduction
Postpartum haemorrhage is an important cause of maternal
mortality. It causes acute anaemia with physical sequelae
varying from fatigue to severe haemodynamic disturbance.
A recent systematic review showed a worldwide incidence
of severe postpartum haemorrhage (blood loss of at least
1000 ml during delivery)1 of 1.9% in the period 1997–
2006.2
The most important treatment of severe postpartum
haemorrhage is red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, with the
aim to reduce morbidity. In the past few years increasing
concerns have arisen about the supply and safety of this
treatment, encouraging more conservative management.3
Despite
the
introduction
of
several
new
guidelines,4,5
transfusion criteria still vary widely between clinicians.
The decision whether to prescribe RBC transfusion is
mainly based on postpartum haemoglobin (Hb) concen-
trations, where guidelines recommend RBC transfusion
when Hb concentration is <6 g/dl and no transfusion in
women with an Hb concentration >10 g/dl.5–7 A survey
among Dutch gynaecologists revealed that RBC transfu-
sion
for
anaemic
postpartum
women
was
considered
when Hb concentration was <5.0 mmol/l (8.1 g/dl).8 To
provide insight into potential risks of anaemia and bene-
ﬁts of transfusion in women with severe postpartum
haemorrhage we conducted the Wellbeing of Obstetric
patients on Minimal Blood transfusions (WOMB) study, a
multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial assessing the
effect of RBC transfusion on health-related quality of life
in women with acute anaemia due to severe postpartum
haemorrhage. A non-inferiority design was chosen because
the non-intervention treatment in this study has greater
availability, reduced costs, less invasiveness and leads to
fewer
adverse
effects.
Physical
fatigue
was
chosen
as
primary outcome because it was considered the earliest
arising complaint in acute anaemia. Based on the results
of a pilot study the largest difference was expected at day
three.9
Methods
The study was approved by the University of Rotterdam’s
Institutional Review Board (MEC-2003-247), and had local
approval from the boards of all participating hospitals. The
study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00335023
and at the Dutch Trial Register (NTR335).
The methods have already been reported in detail.10
Patients
We enrolled women in 37 Dutch hospitals from May 2004
to February 2011. Eligible women sustained postpartum
haemorrhage (blood loss of ≥1000 ml and/or a decrease in
Hb concentration of ≥1.9 g/dl [1.2 mmol/l]) and had an Hb
concentration between 4.8 and 7.9 g/dl (3.0–4.9 mmol/l)
12–24 hours after delivery. The lower Hb threshold was
formulated at the request of the Institutional Review Board
because in the original protocol no lower threshold was
deﬁned. Participants either delivered in hospital or were
admitted after a home birth. Exclusion criteria were severe
symptoms of anaemia (deﬁned as dyspnoea, syncope,
tachycardia [>100 beats/minute], angina pectoris and/or
transient ischaemic attacks), RBC transfusion administered
during
or
within
12 hours
after
delivery,
severe
pre-eclampsia, severe infectious disease, congenital haemo-
lytic disease, compromised immunological status, malig-
nancy, severe co-morbidity (ASA II/III), and death or
critical condition of the neonate. Finally, a good knowledge
of the Dutch language was required. Participants were seen
by research midwives and nurses who provided counselling,
obtained informed consent, monitored the study protocol
and collected data.
Randomisation
After informed consent, women were randomly allocated in
a 1:1 ratio to receive RBC transfusion or no intervention,
using a web-based application for block randomisation
with a variable block size of two to eight. Randomisation
was stratiﬁed for mode of delivery and participating hospi-
tal. Due to the intervention’s nature, the study was not
blinded.
From
2005
onwards,
women
who
declined
informed consent were asked to complete questionnaires;
follow up was identical.
Women allocated to RBC transfusion received at least
one unit of red blood cells; we aimed to reach an Hb con-
centration of at least 8.9 g/dl (5.5 mmol/l). The Hb and
haematocrit concentrations were recorded before and after
RBC transfusion. In women allocated to non-intervention,
RBC transfusion was allowed if severe symptoms of anae-
mia developed or at their physicians’ discretion. Additional
use of iron and/or folic acid supplementation according to
local protocol was allowed.
Follow up and outcome measures
The follow up period was limited to 6 weeks postpartum.
Health-related quality of life questionnaires were to be
completed at ﬁve points in time: at inclusion, 3 days,
1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks postpartum. Physical compli-
cations during follow up were recorded and Hb concentra-
tion was determined at inclusion and 6 weeks postpartum.
The primary outcome was physical fatigue at day 3, mea-
sured with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory.11 This
time-point was chosen as the difference between arms was
expected to be largest at day 3 because data of the pilot study
showed that Hb 12–24 hours postpartum was related to
health-related quality of life at the same time-point but not

to health-related quality of life 1 week after delivery.12 Sec-
ondary outcomes were remaining health-related quality of life
scores, number of RBC units transfused, transfusion reactions,
length of hospital stay and physical complications during
follow up (infections, thromboembolic events, secondary
postpartum haemorrhage and other physical complications).
Ethnicity was assessed according to the deﬁnition of
Statistics Netherlands.13 In twin pregnancies, we used the
data of the ﬁrst child in the analyses. With more than one
mode of delivery method, one mode was recorded using
the following order: caesarean section, operative vaginal
delivery, spontaneous vaginal delivery. With more than one
method of analgesia, this was recorded using the following
order: general anaesthesia, locoregional anaesthesia, opiates.
Health-related quality of life
We used internationally validated health-related quality of
life measures: the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and
the Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form Health
Survey version one (ShortForm-36). The Multidimensional
Fatigue Inventory is a domain-speciﬁc measure for physical
and mental fatigue. The Multidimensional Fatigue Inven-
tory consists of 20 items grouped into ﬁve dimensions:
general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced
motivation and mental fatigue.11 The Multidimensional
Fatigue Inventory scores range from 4 to 20; higher scores
indicate a higher degree of fatigue. The health-related qual-
ity of life questionnaire Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory
scores fatigue on several domains and has a high feasibility,
reliability and validity in chronically anaemic women.14
The ShortForm-36 is a generic health-related quality of life
measure with eight dimensions: physical functioning, role
limitations due to physical health problems (role–physical),
bodily
pain,
general
health
perception,
vitality,
social
functioning,
role
limitations
due
to
emotional
health
(role–emotional) and mental health.15 The ShortForm-36
scores range from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better
functioning or wellbeing. The ShortForm-36 is a generic
questionnaire widely used for measuring patient-reported
outcomes.16 Population-based norm scores are available for
the Dutch adaptation of ShortForm-36.17 Both health-re-
lated quality of life questionnaires were previously validated
in postpartum women in a pilot study.9 The Multidimen-
sional Fatigue Inventory was to be completed at all ﬁve
time-points, whereas the ShortForm-36 was to be com-
pleted at 1 week, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.
Sample size
For the subscale physical fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue
Inventory), a minimum clinically important difference had
not been established before our study. Therefore data from
a pilot study, assessing health-related quality of life in post-
partum women,9 was used. We calculated that, with a sam-
ple size of 400 women (200 per arm), a difference of 1.3
points or greater (in favour of the RBC transfusion arm
regarding physical fatigue at day 3) could be excluded
(power: 80%, one-sided a: 0.025). This difference was
considered small and clinically irrelevant and therefore used
as non-inferiority boundary. Because we observed that 20%
of health-related quality of life data was missing, in 2008
we decided to include 500 women.
Statistics
Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.
Continuous variables were summarised as means with stan-
dard deviations (SD), or medians with interquartile ranges
(IQR). Health-related quality of life scores were presented
as differences in adjusted means with 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI).
Non-inferiority is intended to show that the effect of one
treatment is not worse than that of an active control by more
than a prespeciﬁed boundary. When the difference between
study arms does not exceed this boundary, non-inferiority is
demonstrated. A difference can be statistically signiﬁcant but
too small to be clinically relevant: only when the difference
exceeds the non-inferiority boundary is clinical relevance
demonstrated. The signiﬁcance of the difference between
study arms is therefore of minor importance.
Besides evaluation of physical fatigue in both study arms,
we tested non-inferiority of the primary outcome measure
by assessing whether the upper 95% CI lay within the
non-inferiority boundary. Adjusted means of primary out-
come and remaining Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory
scores were calculated using repeated measurement analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with an unstructured covariance matrix,
while including baseline value (at inclusion) and mode of
delivery as covariates. The same statistical method was used
for the ShortForm-36 scores, with only mode of delivery as a
covariate, because the ShortForm-36 was not completed at
inclusion. Additionally, the inﬂuence of mode of delivery
was analysed using repeated measurement ANOVA, with an
unstructured covariance matrix including baseline value as
covariate.
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory scores were analysed
if data were available at inclusion and at least one addi-
tional time-point. ShortForm-36 scores were analysed if at
least one questionnaire (1 week, 3 weeks or 6 weeks) was
completed. Internal consistency within questionnaires was
assessed for each Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and
ShortForm-36 subscale by calculating Cronbach’s a; this
showed high reliability, with a > 0.70 for all health-related
quality of life subscales except the ShortForm-36 dimension
bodily pain (a > 0.5).
Prespeciﬁed exploratory subgroup analyses of the pri-
mary outcome were performed for Hb concentration at
inclusion with categories 4.8–6.5, 6.6–7.3 and 7.4–7.9 g/dl

(3.0–4.0, 4.1–4.5 and 4.6–4.9 mmol/l) and for physical fati-
gue score at inclusion using quartiles. The signiﬁcance of
differences in primary outcome between subgroups (effect
modiﬁcation)
was
calculated.
A
post-hoc
per-protocol
analysis was performed after excluding women allocated to
non-intervention
who
received
RBC
transfusion,
and
women allocated to RBC transfusion who did not receive
RBC units. Estimates of ANOVA of health-related quality of
life means were calculated to create graphics. Superiority
analyses were used to analyse secondary outcomes. For sec-
ondary analyses, we used the chi-square test for comparing
proportions and the Mann–Whitney U test for comparing
continuous variables. P-values given are two-sided and 0.05
was considered the limit of signiﬁcance. Data were analysed
using SPSS version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
During the study, 1011 women were approached; 521
gave informed consent for randomisation: 259 were allo-
cated to RBC transfusion and 262 to non-intervention.
After
randomisation,
two
participants
were
excluded
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (Fig-
ure 1). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of both
randomised and nonrandomised women. Among rando-
mised
women,
no
signiﬁcant
differences
were
found
between study arms. Two neonatal deaths in preterm
neonates occurred during follow up due to sepsis and
necrotising enterocolitis.
Baseline characteristics of responders versus nonrespond-
ers (at least one completed questionnaire versus no ques-
tionnaires) showed signiﬁcant differences for ethnicity, age
and blood loss (responders versus nonresponders; western
ethnicity in 81% versus 54%, mean age 31 versus 28 years,
median blood loss 1500 versus 1150 ml).
Concentration
of
Hb
at
inclusion
was
comparable
between study arms (Table 1). Women randomised to RBC
transfusion received a median of two RBC units. In these
women, median Hb concentration after transfusion was
9.0 g/dl and median Hb concentration at discharge was
signiﬁcantly higher than in women allocated to non-inter-
vention (Table 2). Among women allocated to RBC trans-
fusion, seven received no RBC transfusion: four withdrew
consent, one appeared to have no health insurance, one
had fever and one had irregular erythrocyte alloantibodies.
Of women allocated to non-intervention, 33/261 (13%)
received RBC transfusion during follow up. Indications
were anaemic symptoms (n = 28), blood loss following
retained placenta (n = 3), discomfort with parenteral iron
supplementation (n = 1) and readmission for endometritis
(n = 1). Compared with women who did not receive
another transfusion during follow up, these women had
lower Hb concentrations and higher physical fatigue scores
at inclusion (median Hb 7.4 versus 6.9 g/dl, P = 0.02 and
median physical fatigue score 19 versus 17, P = 0.08). In
those women who suffered symptoms of anaemia, RBC
transfusion was given at a median of 2 days (IQR 1–3),
and ﬁve were readmitted. Three transfusion reactions

(3/291) were recorded, all in the RBC transfusion arm: one
developed a rash (WHO Category 1, mild transfusion reac-
tion) and two a rise in temperature (WHO Category 2,
moderate–severe transfusion reaction).18
Concentrations
of
Hb at
6 weeks were
comparable
between study arms, as demonstrated in Table 2.
Primary outcome (physical fatigue at day 3) was analy-
sed in 208 women in the RBC transfusion arm and in 204
women in the non-intervention arm. Women randomised
to non-intervention had a 0.78 higher mean physical fati-
gue score at day 3 than women randomised to RBC trans-
fusion (95% CI 0.1–1.5, P = 0.024) (Figure 2, Table 3).
The non-inferiority boundary was just exceeded by the
95% CI. At 1 week, the difference in physical fatigue scores
between study arms was 1.06 (95% CI 0.3–1.8, P = 0.007)
(Table 3). In Figure 3, mean differences in physical fatigue
scores between study arms and conﬁdence intervals are pre-
sented with the non-inferiority boundary. Primary outcome
was not signiﬁcantly affected by mode of delivery (interac-
tion P-value: 0.40).
The remaining health-related quality of life scores are
presented in the Supplementary material, Table S1. All
Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory subscales, with the
exception of mental fatigue at 3 days, showed slightly
higher mean scores in the RBC non-intervention arm: the
largest difference was 1.1 (physical fatigue at 1 week).
Regarding
the
ShortForm-36,
differences
in
subscale
scores between arms ran up to 5.5 points (physical
functioning at 1 week) with a tendency to lower health
scores in the non-intervention arm. The difference was
signiﬁcant only in the subscale physical functioning at 1
and 3 weeks (scores respectively 5.5 and 4.3 points lower
in the non-intervention arm). Again though, signiﬁcance
of
the
difference
is
of
secondary
interest
to
its
magnitude, which seems relatively small on the scale of
ShortForm-36.

Transfusion policy after postpartum haemorrhage

Health-related quality of life results were similar after
excluding questionnaires not completed within the pre-
scribed time frames after follow up (0–2, 2–5, 6–10 days,
2–4 and 5–7 weeks postpartum) (138/1803 questionnaires
excluded).
Length of hospital stay after delivery was equal in both
study arms (median days: 2, P = 0.37) and physical com-
plications were comparable (Table 4). Use of iron supple-
mentation was more frequent in women allocated to
non-intervention. The percentage of women who breastfed
initially, as well as those who continued until 6 weeks post-
partum, was not different between study arms (Table 4).
Results were consistent in a per-protocol analysis (mean
physical fatigue score at day 3 was 0.80 higher in the
non-intervention arm, P = 0.03, 95% CI 0.1–1.5).
The difference at day 3 in mean physical fatigue scores
per category Hb at inclusion (Hb 4.8–6.5, 6.6–7.3 and 7.4–
7.9 g/dl) was 1.19 ( SE 1.07), 0.91 ( SE 0.60), and 0.73
( SE 0.44), respectively. These differences did not signiﬁ-
cantly differ from each other (P = 0.91). Per category phys-
ical fatigue score at inclusion (<14, 14–17, 18–19, 20) these
differences were 1.58 ( SE 1.02), 1.22 ( SE 0.68), 0.61
( SE 0.71) and 0.10 ( SE 0.49), respectively, and did
not signiﬁcantly differ from each other (P = 0.42).
Ten randomised women were retrospectively identiﬁed
with an exclusion criterion: HIV (three), severe pre-eclampsia
(four) and thalassaemia (three). Primary outcome analysis
after excluding these women gave similar results (data not
shown).
Non-randomised women
Of the 490 women who declined informed consent; 415
(85%) were willing to complete questionnaires: 53 chose
RBC transfusion and 362 non-intervention. Characteristics
of nonrandomised participants are described in Table 1.
Compared
with
randomised
women,
nonrandomised
women were less often of western ethnicity: 363/471 (77%)
versus 293/346 (85%), P = 0.01; and had less often had an
operative vaginal delivery: 110/402 (27%) versus 61/318
(19%), P = 0.01).
Among non-randomised women, Hb concentration was
signiﬁcantly lower in women who chose RBC transfusion
(median Hb 7.4 versus 6.9 g/dl, P < 0.001). The women who
chose RBC transfusion all received RBC units. Of women
who chose non-intervention, 41/362 (11%) received RBC
transfusion, 34 (9%) because of anaemic symptoms. These
rates are comparable to the rates in randomised women.
Discussion
Main ﬁndings
In this study, the difference in physical fatigue at day 3
postpartum between both study arms was small. Although

the difference was only 0.78, the 95% CI of this difference
(0.1–1.5) just exceeded the non-inferiority boundary of 1.3.
Although
non-inferiority
cannot
be
demonstrated,
the
clinical relevance of this difference seems negligible. No
differences were found between study arms for secondary
outcomes.
Regarding non-inferiority, its boundary is ideally based
on the minimum clinically important difference, however,
minimum clinically important differences for the Multidi-
mensional Fatigue Inventory subscales had not been estab-
lished in 2004. The prespeciﬁed level of 1.3 was the feasible
detectable difference in physical fatigue calculated using
data obtained in a pilot study9: this was not considered a
valid estimate of the score’s clinical relevance. Retrospec-
tively, our prespeciﬁed level seems too strict considering
the following arguments. First, the minimum clinically
important difference for physical fatigue has recently been
determined to be larger, namely 2.04, in radiotherapy

Transfusion policy after postpartum haemorrhage

patients.19 Second, the difference in physical fatigue score
in this study is very small, given the large difference
between scores after uncomplicated deliveries (derived from
the pilot study) and scores after postpartum haemorrhage
(this study). These scores, demonstrated in Figure 2, indi-
cate that postpartum haemorrhage greatly increases physi-
cal fatigue irrespective of the treatment policy. Third, in
social sciences, Cohen’s effect size (d) is used to determine
a relevant difference (relevant when d ≥0.50).20 In our
data, values of d were <0.20 for all Multidimensional
Fatigue Inventory subscales (calculated at all time-points),
indicating no relevant differences. The disadvantage of
Cohen’s effect size, and the reason not to include it in this
study design, is that the measure is distribution-based,
whereas we think determining clinical relevance should be
content-based. In addition, we analysed all randomised and
nonrandomised patients together and found that the differ-
ence in physical fatigue between study arms was equal (0.8)
to the difference in randomised patients alone, while its
95% CI was smaller (0.23–1.27) and so does not exceed the
non-inferiority boundary.
Interpretation
Most trials investigating transfusion policy were conducted
in
intensive
care,
cardiovascular,
and
orthopaedic
patients,21–29 while recently a trial in patients with gastroin-
testinal bleeding has been published.30 Six trials used as
restrictive trigger an Hb threshold of ≥8 g/dl22–26,30 and
two used haematocrit thresholds of 24% and 30%.27,28 To
our knowledge, only Hebert conducted a randomised con-
trolled trial with Hb thresholds below 8 g/dl (Hb <7 g/dl
versus <9 g/dl).21 This study in intensive care patients
showed that a restrictive threshold was at least as effective
regarding mortality, multi-organ failure, and length of
hospital stay in patients without cardiac disease. A recent
update on Cochrane evidence regarding Hb thresholds,
including
19
randomised
trials
and
more
than
6000
women, demonstrated a relative risk for 30-day all-cause
mortality of 0.85 (95% CI 0.70–1.03) in women allocated to
a lower Hb threshold (threshold varying from 7 to 10 g/dl)
compared with a more liberal transfusion policy. Also, a
lower threshold was not associated with any signiﬁcant
differences in major complications.31 In our study, physical
complications between study arms were also comparable, as
was duration of hospital stay.
Previously, few studies investigated postpartum heal-
th-related quality of life. The Multidimensional Fatigue
Inventory was only used in our pilot study, to validate
health-related quality of life measures in Dutch postpartum
women.9 This study found signiﬁcant differences in Multi-
dimensional Fatigue Inventory scores after different modes
of delivery, though the present study has not conﬁrmed
this ﬁnding. After vaginal delivery, women in the pilot
study had signiﬁcantly more favourable scores than in the
present study, whereas the scores after caesarean section in
the pilot study were comparable to scores in the present
study. Differences in physical fatigue between modes of
delivery might be inﬂuenced by the large effect of postpar-
tum haemorrhage on physical fatigue.

Minimum

differences determined in orthopaedic problems, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma and cardiac disease
are at least 10 points so the differences found in Short-
Form-36 subscales in this study (maximal difference 5.5)
seem to not be clinically relevant.32–34
Strengths and limitations
Main strengths of this study are the comparison of rando-
mised arms and the large study population. Questionnaires
to score health-related quality of life outcomes were inter-
nationally validated. Primary outcome was available in 412/
519 (80%) of randomised participants, a usual response
rate in health-related quality of life studies. A large percent-
age of eligible women declined informed consent, mainly
because they did not want an intervention. Baseline charac-
teristics of randomised versus nonrandomised participants
showed only differences in ethnicity and frequency of
operative delivery.
The majority of participants in our study delivered vagi-
nally. Women presumably receive RBC transfusions more
reluctantly in operating theatres than after vaginal deliver-
ies. As a result of the small numbers, comparisons between
emergency and elective caesarean sections could not be
made. Although iron supplementation is assumed to have
no effect after RBC transfusion, still a remarkable percent-
age of women in the RBC transfusion arm used iron sup-
plementation. Wide variations in type, dosage and duration
of iron supplementation made it impossible to make com-
parisons. Though the assumption is that anaemia compro-
mises breastfeeding,35 our study showed that more women
in
the
non-intervention
arm
were
still
breastfeeding
6 weeks postpartum although the intention to breastfeed
had been similar in the study arms. These results should be
interpreted with caution because reasons for discontinua-
tion of breast feeding were not reported.
A minority of clinicians is unaware of or reluctant to
accept
lower
transfusion
thresholds.36
Implementing
a
restrictive approach to RBC transfusion would lead to a
striking decrease in demand for RBC units and adverse
events. In our study, the use of RBC units in the
non-intervention arm was 88/517 (17%) of that in the
RBC transfusion arm (Table 2). A high percentage of
women in the non-intervention arm (28/261, 11%) second-
arily received RBC units for anaemic symptoms. Among
1012

Prick et al.

non-randomised women this percentage was similar, even
though they were expected to be more motivated for
non-intervention.
The randomised women allocated to non-intervention
who received RBC transfusion during follow up had signiﬁ-
cantly lower Hb concentrations at inclusion. Also, a trend
towards a larger difference in physical fatigue between
study arms was seen in the women in the lowest category
Hb concentrations and in highest category of physical fati-
gue scores at inclusion. Therefore, Hb concentration should
be
considered
when
counselling
postpartum
anaemic
women: RBC transfusion seems to have the greatest effect
in women with the lowest Hb and highest physical fatigue
scores.
Conclusion
The difference in mean physical fatigue score between
study arms was only small (0.78). The clinical relevance of
this difference seems negligible even though non-inferiority
of non-intervention policy could statistically not be demon-
strated. The recently established minimum clinical differ-
ence of physical fatigue,19 suggests that non-intervention
policy is safe with regard to physical complications and
only accompanied by slightly higher physical fatigue scores;
we feel that our results justify the implementation of
non-intervention in daily clinical practice. Future studies
are needed to establish the optimal iron supplementation
in these women and justify implementation of a non-inferi-
ority policy.
