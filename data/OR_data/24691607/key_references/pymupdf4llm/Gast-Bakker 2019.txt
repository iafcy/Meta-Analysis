Abstract Objective: To investigate the safety and effects of a
restrictive red blood cell (RBC)
transfusion strategy in pediatric cardiac surgery patients.
Design: Randomized controlled
trial. Setting: Pediatric ICU in an
academic tertiary care center, Leiden
University Medical Center, Leiden,
The Netherlands. Patients: One
hundred seven patients with noncyanotic congenital heart defects
between 6 weeks and 6 years of age.
One hundred three patients underwent
corrective surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass. Interventions: Prior to
surgery patients were randomly
assigned to one of two groups with
specific RBC transfusion thresholds:
Hb 10.8 g/dl (6.8 mmol/l) and Hb
8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l). Measurements: Length of stay in hospital
(primary outcome), length of stay in
PICU, duration of ventilation (secondary outcome), incidence of
adverse events and complications
related to randomization (intention to
treat analysis). Results: In the
restrictive transfusion group, mean


volume of transfused RBC was 186
(±70) ml per patient and in the liberal
transfusion group 258 (±87) ml per
patient, (95 % CI 40.6–104.6),
p \ 0.001. Length of hospital stay
was shorter in patients with a
restrictive RBC transfusion strategy:
median 8 (IQR 7–11) vs. 9 (IQR
7–14) days, p = 0.047. All other
outcome measures and incidence of
adverse effects were equal in both
RBC transfusion groups. Cost of
blood products for the liberal transfusion group was 438.35 (±203.39)
vs. 316.27 (±189.96) euros (95 % CI
46.61–197.51) per patient in the
restrictive transfusion group,
p = 0.002. Conclusions: For
patients with a non-cyanotic congenital heart defect undergoing elective
cardiac surgery, a restrictive RBC
transfusion policy (threshold of Hb
8.0 g/dl) during the entire perioperative period is safe, leads to a shorter
hospital stay and is less expensive.

### Introduction

Blood transfusions can be lifesaving in patients with
excessive bleeding or severe anemia. A retrospective
survey among pediatric intensive care units in the USA
showed that 54.5 % of all children with a pre-transfusion
hemoglobin concentration (Hb) below 9 g/dl (5.6 mmol/l)
received at least one red blood cell (RBC) transfusion [1].
Although transfusion practice has become increasingly
safe over the years, numerous data published in the past
decade have demonstrated various deleterious effects of
blood transfusions [2–11]. Therefore, current transfusion
practice has evolved to increasingly restrictive use of
blood product transfusions in adults [12–14].
Up until quite recently, it has been a widely held belief
that withholding blood transfusions to anemic young children, especially infants, is harmful. Children have an
increased metabolic rate and thus an increased tissue oxygen
demand compared to adults, while at the same time they have
a limited ability to increase their cardiac output to compensate for a fall in Hb. Like in adults, pediatric studies have
demonstrated not only an increase in morbidity but also an
increased mortality associated with RBC transfusion [5–8,
15–17]. Most patients, also children, tolerate lower hemoglobin levels than were previously held appropriate for this
age group, without any deleterious effects [9, 14, 18–26].
Since the landmark paper by Lacroix [27], which
demonstrated that a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy
with an Hb threshold of 7 g/dl (4.4 mmol/l) in stable,
critically ill children decreases transfusion requirements
without increasing adverse outcome, clinicians have
questioned the need for a higher Hb in the pediatric
population [15, 16, 28, 29]. However, a well-defined Hb
threshold value to use for making the decision when to
transfuse or not is unavailable [15, 16, 18–21, 28, 30, 31].
Perioperative management in congenital heart surgery
is aimed at maximizing systemic oxygen delivery. It is
generally believed that oxygen delivery can be improved
by increasing Hb; therefore, treatment of anemia is the
main rationale for transfusing children after cardiac surgery [9, 15–17, 20, 21, 32]. This concept, however, has
never been proven [9, 28, 32].
The published experience with restrictive RBC transfusion strategies in pediatric cardiac surgery is not
extensive. In this study we sought to determine the safety
and effects of a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy in
children undergoing corrective surgery for a non-cyanotic
congenital heart defect.

### Methods and materials

Setting

This randomized clinical trial was conducted at Leiden
University Medical Center (LUMC), an academic tertiary


care center. The study was approved by the institutional
Ethics Committee (protocol P07.186).

Study population

Between April 2009 and January 2012, 162 eligible
patients were scheduled for elective surgery for a noncyanotic congenital heart defect. Inclusion criteria were
elective surgery for a congenital heart defect; patients
between 6 weeks and 6 years of age and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 95 % on admission.
All parents/legal guardians received written information about the study protocol prior to scheduled admission
to the hospital. Additional verbal information was presented to the parents/legal guardians on the day of
hospital admission. Prior to anesthesia and surgery,
written informed consent was obtained from all parents/
legal guardians. Upon request of parents/legal guardians,
patients could be withdrawn from study participation at
any time.

Study protocol

In a single-center open-labeled randomized controlled
trial, the safety and effects of two RBC-transfusion policies were determined in pediatric patients with a noncyanotic congenital heart defect that required elective
cardiac surgery.
After written informed consent, sealed randomization
envelopes were opened. Patients were allocated to one of
two transfusion strategies. In the liberal transfusion group
(group A) patients received RBC transfusion if their Hb
concentration dropped below 10.8 g/dl (6.8 mmol/l). In
the restrictive transfusion group (group B), patients
received an RBC transfusion if their Hb concentration
was 8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l) or less. When a threshold was
reached, each patient was to receive an RBC transfusion
of 10 ml/kg. RBC units were always leukocyte-depleted.
The transfusion policy was to be adhered to from induction of anesthesia until hospital discharge. All other
aspects of patient care were left to the discretion of the
attending physician. Hb values were measured 1 day
before the operation, at induction of anesthesia, following
both initiation and discontinuation of cardiopulmonary
bypass (CPB) and directly on admission to the PICU. At
the PICU, Hb values are checked routinely, every 6 h for
the first 24 h after admission, if necessary more frequently on an individual basis and thereafter once daily.
Transfusion thresholds were communicated to the
attending physician and entered in the Patient Data
Management System (PDMS) (Metavision, iMDsoft,
Needham, MA, USA) at bedside. Nurses were asked to
monitor and report blood loss and also to report all RBC
transfusions by entering the RBC transfusion volume and


-----

RBC bag ID number into the PDMS. When an RBC
transfusion was either withheld or administered in contradiction to the randomization protocol, this was
considered a protocol violation.

Anesthesia and CPB

Anesthesia was performed with inhalation of sevoflurane
followed by intravenous administration of pancuronium,
sufentanil and propofol in all patients. All patients were
intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube (Kimvent[TM]

Microcuff[TM], Kimberly-Clark Health Care, Roswell, GE,
USA) and ventilated according to institutional protocol.
All patients received a peripheral venous catheter, an
arterial canula and a central venous PediaSat Oximetry
Catheter (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA). The
PediaSat catheter was preferably sited in the right jugular
vein for additional monitoring of central venous oxygen
saturation (ScvO2). Additional monitoring in the operating theatre and PICU included bilateral cerebral oxygen
saturation with a Somanetics Invos Cerebral Oximeter
(Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) and depth of anesthesia
with the Bispectral index (compact BISx Power Link[TM],
Philips, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). The last two
monitoring tools are standard care for all pediatric cardiac
operations performed at our hospital.
Cardiopulmonary bypass was performed using phosphorylcholine-coated closed circuit tubing and a hollowfiber membrane oxygenator (Sorin Group Italia, Mirandola, Modena, Italy), using standard techniques according
to age and weight. The CPB circuit was primed with
crystalloid and colloid solutions. Mannitol, albumin,
RBCs and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) were added to the
bypass circuit as needed. The amount of RBCs was
individually calculated using the following variables:
bodyweight, preoperative hematocrit and prime volume:

CV ¼ weight � 80 ml,

Ek ¼ CV � Ht,

Tv ¼ CV þ CPB volume,

En ¼ Tv � 0:25;

En � Ek=0:55 ¼ ml RBC needed for prime:

In this calculation, CV = circulating blood volume,
Ek = volume of erythrocytes, Tv = total volume, and
En = the calculated amount of erythrocytes resulting in a
Ht of 0.25.
Myocardial protection was achieved with cold crystalloid cardioplegia. After separation from CPB, heparin
was reversed with protamine 3 mg/kg or more as necessary in order to normalize the activated clotting time to
the preoperative value. On completion of CPB, performing modified ultra-filtration (MUF) is common practice in


our hospital. After induction of anesthesia, dexamethasone (0.5 mg/kg) was administered to all patients.
Intraoperative use of antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic
acid) and cell salvage are routine at the study site. Patients
received milrinone, norepinephrine or dobutamine at the
discretion of the attending anesthetist and surgical team.
Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis consisted of 24 h of
cefazoline.

Data collection

Data collection consisted of demographic data, cardiac
diagnosis, RACHS-1 score [33], duration of CPB, aortic
cross-clamp time, PRISM II/III and PIM 2 scores [34, 35],
blood loss and blood transfusion data. Data recorded
directly from PDMS included heart rate (HR), arterial
blood pressure (ABP), central venous pressure (CVP),
central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2), cerebral regional O2 saturation of the left and right hemisphere (rSO2),
body temperature and ventilator settings. Additionally, we
recorded protocoladherence,incidenceof (serious) adverse
events, complications and use of concomitant medication.

End points

The primary outcome measure was in-hospital length of
stay (LOS), calculated in days.
Secondary outcomes were PICU LOS (days), duration
of mechanical ventilatory support (defined as the time
between induction of anesthesia and extubation at the
PICU, and expressed in hours) and incidence of all
reported (serious) adverse events, complications and
transfusion costs. Respiratory infections (defined as fever,
leucocytosis, signs on chest X-ray and a positive sputum
culture) were noted as a complication. Re-thoracotomy,
hemato- or pneumothorax and resuscitation (CPR) were
registered as serious adverse events and were reported to
the institutional ethics committee. Costs of blood products
were calculated in euros based on information from the
Sanquin Blood Bank, Leiden, The Netherlands.

Statistical analysis

Assuming a significant difference in hospital LOS from
20.1 (±21.8) (group A) to 10.1 (±10.9) (group B), we
estimated that 48 patients would be needed per group for a
power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05 (Department of Medical
Statistics and Bioinformatics, Leiden University).
Statistical analysis was conducted according to an
intention-to-treat approach.
Continuous variables are described as mean with (SD)
or medians with interquartile range (IQR) if the data were
not normally distributed. Based on distribution, continuous


-----

variables were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test or
Student’s t test, when appropriate. Categorical variables
are described as numbers (n) and percentages. The categorical variables were examined using a chi-square test or
Fisher’s exact test (if the expected number in any cell was
\5). A Kaplan-Meier curve was calculated and plotted to
assess hospital LOS, PICU LOS and duration of ventilatory
support. The effect of a difference in gender distribution in
the two groups was evaluated in a Cox regression analysis.
Differences between group A and B were considered significant with two-sided p values B0.05. Data analysis was
performed using SPSS 20 (Chicago, IL, USA).

### Results

Between April 2009 and January 2012, a total of 162
patients with non-cyanotic congenital heart defects were
eligible for participation in the study. In 55 cases, patients
were not eligible for randomization (Fig. 1).
After obtaining informed consent, we enrolled 107
patients into the study. After randomization, the study was
discontinued in seven patients because of a protocol
violation (Fig. 1). Of these seven patients, four (aortic
coarctation) were operated on without CPB and required
minimal or no RBC transfusions. For ethical considerations (the chance of randomization in the liberal group A
and thereby forced RBC transfusions), patients with aortic
coarctation were excluded by approved addendum to the
original study protocol.
The 107 patients had a median age of 8.4 (IQR
3.2–29.5) months, with a median weight of 7.2 (IQR
5.0–12.0) kg, and 53 % were male. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to
age, weight, RACHS-1, PRISM and PIM scores. Duration
of the operation, duration of CPB and cross-clamp time
were similar for both groups. Characteristics of the
patients according to allocation are listed in Table 1. Data
inspection showed a possibly non-negligible difference in
gender distribution.
All patients had comparable Hb values the day before
and at the start of the operation. During CPB and surgery,
an equal amount of RBC and FFP was transfused in both
groups (Electronic Supplementary Material), resulting in
equal Hb values directly after the CPB and MUF procedure (Table 2). After CPB, Hb concentrations began to
diverge because of the implementation of the study protocol. The mean Hb concentration, prior to discharge from
the PICU, was 12.2 (±1.2) g/dl (7.5 ± 0.8 mmol/l) in the
liberal transfusion group after 4.5 days compared to 10.2
(±1.2) g/dl (6.4 ± 0.8 mmol/l) in the restrictive group
after 3.6 days (95 % CI 1.44–2.39), p \ 0.001. All RBC
transfusions were administered in the PICU, thus none
during the remainder of the hospital stay. The mean


transfused RBC volumes in the liberal group (A) and
restrictive group (B) were 258 (±87) vs. 186 (±70) ml
per patient (95 % CI 40.6–104.6), p \ 0.001. Average
blood loss due to production from the chest tube and due
to blood withdrawal was comparable between groups
(Table 2).
Red blood cell units used for transfusion were up to
30 days old. The average storage time of transfused RBCs
in this study was 9.8 (±7.0) days. Storage time was not
different between the two study groups (p = 0.990)
(Table 2).

Primary outcome results

Length of stay in hospital was 9 (7–14) days for the liberal transfusion group (A), whereas for the restrictive
transfusion group (B), it was 8 (7–11) days, log-rank test
p = 0.047 (Fig. 2). Gender included in the Cox regression model with group as the main predictor changed the
probability ratio (hazard ratio) of hospital discharge
slightly from 1.422 to 1.434 (p = 0.079) in favor of the
restrictive transfusion group. Gender itself was not a
significant predictor (p = 0.911). No re-admissions to the
PICU were recorded during the entire study period, and
every patient was discharged home alive.

Secondary outcome results

Duration of mechanical ventilation and LOS in PICU
(days) did not differ. All (serious) adverse events and
complications were recorded during the PICU stay
(Table 3). Of the postoperative complications during the
PICU stay, respiratory infections were most frequently
observed: in five patients in group A; in six patients in
group B, p = 0.726. After extubation one patient in group
A and three patients in group B needed re-intubation,
p = 0.302. The incidence of serious adverse events such as
hemato- or pneumothorax, re-thoracotomy and resuscitation (CPR) at the PICU was equal in both groups (n = 3).
Postoperatively, milrinone and norepinephrine were
administered in an equal number of patients in both
groups. However, the average dose of norepinephrine in
patients in group A of 0.09 (±0.08) lg/kg/min was
slightly higher than in patients in group B with 0.07
(±0.09) lg/kg/min, p = 0.003. Dobutamine was infrequently used as a vasoactive drug in both study groups (in
four patients in group A and seven patients in group B).
The total cost of transfused blood products calculated
per patient (RBCs and FFP combined) was 438.35
(±203.39) euros in the liberal transfusion group
(A) compared to 316.27 (±189.96) euros in the restrictive
transfusion group (B) (95 % CI 46.61–197.51),
p = 0.002. This resulted in a cost reduction of 28 %. The
cost of blood products is presented in detail in Table 3.

and group B: Hb threshold 8.0 g/dl) in non-cyanotic pediatric patients with corrective operations for congenital heart defects


### Discussion

This is the first randomized controlled trial investigating a
restrictive transfusion policy during the entire perioperative period (from induction of anesthesia right up to
hospital discharge) in children undergoing surgery for
congenital heart disease.


This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a
restrictive transfusion strategy was safe in pediatric cardiac surgery patients with a non-cyanotic congenital heart
defect. We found no difference in morbidity between the
groups with the exception of a significant difference in
length of hospital stay in favor of the patients in the
restrictive RBC transfusion group. These data are

consistent with those reported in recently published
comparable studies on the risks and benefits of red cell
transfusions in children, including pediatric cardiac surgical patients [15, 16, 27]. The results from the TRIPICU
study published by Lacroix et al. [27] demonstrated that a
restrictive RBC transfusion strategy with a hemoglobin
threshold of Hb \ 7 g/dl (4.4 mmol/l) in stable, critically
ill children decreases transfusion requirements without
increasing adverse outcomes. In a subgroup analysis of
pediatric cardiac surgery patients in the TRIPICU study,
Willems et al. [16] demonstrated that a restrictive RBC
transfusion strategy, as compared with a liberal strategy
(with an Hb threshold of 9.5 g/dl; 5.9 mmol/l), was not
associated with any significant difference in multiorgan
dysfunction syndrome or length of PICU stay. In this substudy, however, the storage time of transfused RBCs was
not similar in the two groups. Recently, Cholette et al.

[15] demonstrated that children with single-ventricle
physiology did not benefit from a liberal transfusion

strategy after cavo-pulmonary connection. The authors
concluded that a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy did
decrease the number of transfusions, donor exposures and
potential risks in these children.
The premise that an RBC transfusion will result in
improved oxygen delivery and thus decreased tissue
hypoxia no longer holds true. Recent data have suggested
that RBC transfusions might, through various mechanisms, contribute to a reduction in local oxygen delivery
in the tissues, which may play a role in the negative
outcomes associated with transfusions in critically ill
patients despite an increase in the global hemoglobin
concentration and a theoretical increase in global oxygen
delivery [29].
Tolerance of anemia differs over various populations.
A healthy adult with normal compensatory mechanisms
may be capable of dealing with lower Hb levels than an
infant that has just undergone complex cardiac surgery.
The critical Hb level, at which level the body can no
longer compensate for a further fall in Hb, may vary
considerably, depending on many factors including age
and disease. In order to apply an appropriate blood
transfusion management, it is necessary to know the
threshold value of Hb at which we need to transfuse blood
to avoid tissue hypoxia. Unfortunately, we do not know
the transfusion threshold for each individual patient.

(in days). Comparison of length of hospital stay in 107 noncyanotic pediatric cardiac surgery patients with two RBC transfusion strategies. For the liberal transfusion group (A), length of
hospital stay is 9 (7–14) days, whereas for the restrictive transfusion
group (B), it is 8 (7–11) days, log-rank test p = 0.047

In adult volunteers there is no evidence of impaired
tissue oxygenation until Hb levels fall to 4–5 g/dl
(2.4–3.1 mmol/l) [31], while the optimal Hb in critically
ill adults is still unknown. However, an Hb level between
7.0 and 9.0 g/dl has been generally accepted, based on the
paper by Hebert et al. in 1999 [36].


Results found in adults should not be generalized to
critically ill children as they have different diseases and
different adaptive responses compared with adults [30].
On average, the Hb value at which a blood transfusion
is prescribed in critically ill children is 8.0 g/dl
(5.0 mmol/l), which seems to be consistent with the
current practice in many adult intensive care units [19].
We chose an Hb threshold of 8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l) in our
study for the restrictive transfusion strategy group as we
felt this was a safe level in this patient group considering
the close monitoring for signs of inadequate tissue oxygenation. The choice of an Hb threshold of 10.8 g/dl
(6.8 mmol/l) in the liberal transfusion group in our study
was based on the Hb level at which we routinely prescribe
blood transfusions to children after corrective surgery for
non-cyanotic cardiac lesions in our PICU.
Possible deleterious effects of ‘‘old’’ blood—although
almost exclusively found in studies involving non-leukocyte-depleted blood products of more than 14 days
storage time—did not play a role in our study as equal
storage conditions were applied for the RBCs transfused
in both groups. On average, the storage time was equal in
both groups 9.8 (±6.8) vs. 9.8 (±7.2) days (Table 2).
Despite the fact that this is the first randomized controlled trial of a restrictive vs. liberal blood transfusion
strategy in cardiac surgery patients encompassing the
whole perioperative period lasting up to the day of discharge from the hospital, this study seems in line with the
present findings on this issue.
A few limitations, however, have to be delineated.
One limitation of our study is that it was conducted as a
single-center study in a relatively homogeneous, lower
risk cardiac surgical group of patients. This may limit
generalization of the findings. In particular, cyanotic,

single-ventricle patients, in whom the hemoglobin level is
a more critical factor in oxygen delivery, were excluded.
Furthermore, our liberal transfusion trigger is based on
local guidelines.
Another limitation of the study is that we did not
include a third arm based on individual patient status. In
such an individualized study arm, instead of acting on a
preset transfusion threshold, a blood transfusion would
additionally be triggered by signs of inadequate tissue
oxygenation, such as increases in lactate concentrations
and decreased ScvO2, thereby providing information on
the critical hemoglobin level.
Based on the results of this study, the restrictive blood
transfusion policy, with a transfusion threshold of Hb
8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l), has now been implemented in our
pediatric intensive care unit.

### Conclusions

For patients with a non-cyanotic congenital heart defect, a
restrictive RBC transfusion policy with a transfusion
threshold of Hb 8.0 g/dl (5.0 mmol/l) during the entire
perioperative period is safe. Furthermore, restriction in
blood transfusion leads to a shorter duration of hospital
stay and is less expensive compared to a liberal transfusion strategy.
