**Red blood cell transfusion is common in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).**
**However, observational data suggest that this practice may be associated with worse**
**clinical outcomes and data from clinical trials are lacking in this population. We conducted**
**a prospective multicenter randomized pilot trial in which 45 patients with AMI and a**
**hematocrit level <30% were randomized to a liberal (transfuse when hematocrit <30% to**
**maintain 30% to 33%) or a conservative (transfuse when hematocrit <24% to maintain**
**24% to 27%) transfusion strategy. Baseline hematocrit was similar in those in the liberal**
**and conservative arms (26.9% vs 27.5%, p �** **0.4). Average daily hematocrits were 30.6% in**
**the liberal arm and 27.9% in the conservative arm, a difference of 2.7% (p <0.001). More**
**patients in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm were transfused (100% vs 54%,**
**p <0.001) and the average number of units transfused per patient tended to be higher in the**
**liberal arm than in the conservative arm (2.5 vs 1.6, p �** **0.07). The primary clinical safety**
**measurement of in-hospital death, recurrent MI, or new or worsening congestive heart**
**failure occurred in 8 patients in the liberal arm and 3 in the conservative arm (38% vs 13%,**
**p �** **0.046). In conclusion, compared to a conservative transfusion strategy, treating anemic**
**patients with AMI according to a liberal transfusion strategy results in more patients**
**receiving transfusions and higher hematocrit levels. However, this may be associated with**
**worse clinical outcomes. A large-scale definitive trial addressing this issue is urgently**
**required.** **© 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2011;108:1108–1111)**


In patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes
(ACS) red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is a common yet
highly variable practice with uncertain benefit.[1–5] We conducted a randomized pilot trial in which anemic patients
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly assigned to a traditional liberal transfusion strategy or a more
conservative transfusion strategy. The purpose of this study
was to assess the effect of this randomization scheme on
RBC usage rates, hematocrit levels, and clinical safety in a
preliminary manner and thus to inform the design of a
definitive large-scale trial.

**Methods**

This was a prospective multicenter parallel-group randomized pilot trial to compare 2 RBC transfusion strategies in
anemic patients with AMI. Patients were randomly assigned in
a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups by the coordinating center
using consecutively numbered opaque envelopes. Blinding of
treatment assignment was not feasible.

Center with AMI from May 2003 through October 2009 were
considered for enrollment. AMI was defined as ischemic-type
chest discomfort lasting �30 minutes and associated with
a creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) or cardiac troponin level
above the upper limit of normal (determined locally). We
included patients in whom the hematocrit was �30% within
72 hours of symptom onset. We excluded patients for the
following reasons: (1) noncoronary cause for clinical syndrome; (2) active bleeding, defined as overt blood loss accompanied by a decrease in hematocrit of �5% in the preceding 12
hours; (3) inability or unwillingness to receive RBC transfusion; (4) RBC transfusion within 7 days of enrollment; (5)
previous severe transfusion reaction; (6) imminent death; (7)
decision to provide limited or comfort care; (8) age �21 years;
(9) pregnancy; (10) participation in another clinical trial in
which RBC transfusion was a requirement or a component of
a primary or secondary end point; and (11) previous participation in the present study.
The protocol was approved by the institutional review
board of each participating institution. Written informed
consent was provided by the patient or an appropriate surrogate. An independent data and safety monitoring board
monitored the study and performed 4 interim safety analyses during the course of the study. The study was supported
by the Cardiovascular Research Institute of the Washington
[Hospital Center and received no external funding (http://](http://www.Clinicaltrials.gov)
[www.Clinicaltrials.gov, identifier NCT00126334).](http://www.Clinicaltrials.gov)
Hematocrit was measured at least daily. Patients randomized to the liberal transfusion strategy underwent
RBC transfusion when their hematocrit decreased �30%
with the goal of maintaining a hematocrit from 30% to

33%. Patients randomized to the conservative transfusion
strategy underwent RBC transfusion when their hematocrit decreased �24% with the goal of maintaining a
hematocrit from 24% to 27%. In the 2 groups leukocytedepleted packed RBCs were transfused 1 U at a time and
hematocrit was measured again 1 hour later. Additional
units were transfused as necessary to achieve a hematocrit within the target range. If the hematocrit was �5%
below the target range, 2 U were transfused before the
hematocrit was measured again. If a patient underwent a
major surgical procedure, RBCs were subsequently transfused according to the judgment of the treating physician
until discharge from the hospital and any such transfusions were excluded from the transfusion-related analyses (other patient outcomes were not excluded).
Patients could receive RBC transfusion for any of the
following reasons at the discretion of the treating physician:
(1) active bleeding as defined earlier; (2) persistent hypotension related to hypovolemia; (3) active ischemia; and (4)
at any time it was determined that it was in a patient’s best
interest to receive a transfusion. Once the active issue was
resolved, transfusion was again administered according to
the study protocol. In all cases patients were analyzed according to the randomization scheme (“intention to treat”).
Transfusion-related end points included the proportion of
patients receiving �1 transfusion, number of transfusions
received per patient, and average daily hematocrit. The
primary clinical safety measurement was a composite of the
first occurrence of in-hospital death, recurrent MI, or new or
worsening heart failure (HF). Each additional exploratory
clinical end point reported below was prespecified.
Patients were followed daily by study personnel during
their hospitalization and contacted by telephone at 30 days
from randomization. Events were determined by the local
study investigator. Recurrent MI was defined for nonprocedure-related events as recurrent ischemic chest discomfort,
new ischemic electrocardiographic changes, and CK-MB
increase above the upper limit of normal and increased by
�50% over the previous value. For patients with percutaneous coronary intervention �24 hours previously, CK-MB
�3 times the upper limit of normal and increased by �50%
over the previous value was required. For patients with

defined as pain or discomfort considered probable or definite angina that was �5 minutes in duration.
The initial enrollment goal for the trial was 92 patients.
After the fourth interim safety analysis, the data and safety
monitoring board determined that an adequate number of
patients had been enrolled to provide preliminary results
with respect to transfusion-related end points and clinical
safety. Therefore, in the face of slower-than-expected enrollment, the steering committee decided to halt further
enrollment and the study was terminated after the last enrolled patient completed 30-day follow-up.
Between-group comparisons for continuous variables
were made using t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test and
categorical variables were compared using a chi-square test
or Fisher’s exact test as appropriate. Curves of daily hematocrit values were compared using a mixed linear model. A
p value �0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance. Because of the preliminary nature of this pilot
study, no corrections were made for multiple comparisons.

**Results**

We enrolled 45 patients, of whom 21 were randomized to
the liberal transfusion strategy and 24 were randomized to
the conservative transfusion strategy (Figure 1). Mean time
from AMI symptom onset to trial enrollment was 1.6 � 0.5
days. Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 and
were generally similar in the 2 treatment groups. MI characteristics and therapies at time of enrollment are presented
in Table 2. There were 18 patients (40%) with ST-segment
elevation MI and 27 patients (60%) with non–ST-segment
elevation MI. Percutaneous coronary intervention had been
performed in 25 patients (56%) before enrollment. Nearly
all patients were receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.
Baseline hematocrit levels were similar in those randomized to the liberal and conservative treatment arms (26.9 �
1.9% vs 27.5 � 2.4%, p � 0.4). After randomization the mean
hematocrit diverged in the 2 treatment arms and this difference
was maintained throughout the study period (Figure 2). Average daily hematocrit levels were 30.6% in the liberal arm and
27.9% in the conservative arm, an absolute difference of 2.7%
(p �0.001). More patients in the liberal arm than in the conservative arm were transfused with RBCs �1 U (100% vs
54%, p �0.001). Average number of units of RBCs transfused
per patient trended higher in the liberal arm than in the con

in the conservative arm (21%) received a transfusion despite a
hematocrit that was above the transfusion threshold. In 4 of
these patients transfusion was administered in the setting of
active bleeding as allowed by the protocol. One patient in each
group erroneously received an RBC transfusion when the hematocrit was above the transfusion threshold. No transfusion
reactions occurred.
In-hospital follow-up was complete for all patients. Three
patients were lost to follow-up from hospital discharge to 30
days (2 in the liberal group and 1 in the conservative group).
Clinical end points are presented in Table 3. The primary
clinical safety measurement, a composite of in-hospital death,
recurrent MI, or new or worsening HF, occurred in 8 patients
in the liberal arm and 3 patients in the conservative arm (38%
vs 13%, p � 0.046). Most of this difference was accounted for
by an increase in the number of patients with new or worsening
HF in the liberal arm (8 vs 2 patients). Recurrent ischemia
occurred in 1 patient in the conservative arm and none in the
liberal arm. Coronary care unit and hospital lengths of stay
were similar in the 2 groups. At 30 days death, recurrent MI,
or new or worsening HF occurred in 12 patients in the liberal
arm and 4 patients in the conservative arm (60% vs 20%, p �
0.02). There were 2 deaths in the conservative arm (1 because
of probable left ventricular rupture and 1 because of sepsis) and
1 in the liberal arm (because of progressive cardiogenic shock).

**Discussion**

This is the first report of a randomized trial comparing
different RBC transfusion strategies in patients with AMI.
In this small pilot trial we found that the randomization
scheme we used was able to successfully maintain signifi

-----

for the 2 treatment groups throughout the study period. The
conservative transfusion strategy was associated with a 36%
relative decrease in the number of units transfused per
patient and a 46% relative decrease in the proportion of
patients receiving any transfusion. Furthermore, although
our trial was not powered to detect differences in clinical
outcomes, a significantly higher rate of adverse clinical
outcomes—largely related to HF—was observed in patients
randomized to the liberal transfusion strategy.
Theoretically, RBC transfusion might benefit patients
with ACS by increasing oxygen delivery to ischemic myocardium but might be harmful by leading to transfusion
reactions, transmission of diseases, circulatory overload,
acute lung injury, and/or immunosuppression.[6] Previous
studies of the role of RBC transfusion specifically in patients with ACS are observational and have shown conflicting results. Wu et al[5] found that RBC transfusion in Medicare beneficiaries with AMI was associated with a lower
short-term mortality if the admission hematocrit was 30%
and possibly �33%. In contrast, Rao et al[2] reported that
RBC transfusion was associated with a higher 30-day mortality rate when administered to patients with ACS and a
nadir hematocrit of �25%. Yang et al[1] reported a similar
increase in mortality associated with RBC transfusion in
patients with ACS enrolled in a large prospective registry.
To date randomized controlled trials in patients with
ACS have been lacking. The Transfusion Requirements in
Critical Care (TRICC) trial compared a restrictive RBC
transfusion strategy (target hemoglobin 7.0 to 9.0 g/dl) to a
liberal transfusion strategy (target hemoglobin 10.0 to 12.0
g/dl) in 838 anemic patients admitted to general intensive
care units. Thirty-day mortality was similar in the 2 groups
despite a 54% decrease in RBC transfusions in the restrictive strategy group.[7] In the subgroup with cardiovascular
disease there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality. Results were not reported for patients with ACS.[8] The
Functional Outcomes in Cardiovascular Patients Undergoing Surgical Hip Fracture Repair (FOCUS) investigators
randomly assigned 2,016 high-risk elderly patients who
were undergoing hip surgery to a liberal transfusion strategy
(transfusion for hemoglobin �10 g/dl) or a symptom-driven
transfusion strategy (transfusion for symptoms of anemia or
if hemoglobin decreased to �8 g/dl).[9] Neither the primary
functional end point nor the secondary cardiovascular end
points were significantly different between treatment groups. The
Transfusion Requirement After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) trial
randomized 502 patients undergoing cardiac surgery to
transfusion triggers identical to those used in our study. The
restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy resulted in noninferior rates of the combined outcome of 30-day mortality
and severe morbidity.[6]

Our findings in patients with AMI, although clearly preliminary in nature, are in general agreement with these
previous randomized trials in other patient populations in
that we did not observe any signal of clinical harm in those
patients randomized to a conservative transfusion strategy.


Despite the small number of patients enrolled, the significantly lower rate of the primary clinical end point in the
conservative transfusion group—driven by a decrease in HF
events—is plausible because of the substantial volume load
associated with RBC transfusion. It is reassuring that no
patient in this group developed a recurrent MI and only 1
had recurrent ischemia.
Certain important limitations of our study must be acknowledged. First, despite the randomized design, there was
imbalance between the randomized groups in some specific
clinical characteristics. Second, a large proportion of patients in the 2 treatment arms underwent a revascularization
procedure during their hospital stay. Risk of recurrent ischemia associated with a conservative RBC transfusion strategy might be greater in an AMI population treated with a
less aggressive approach to revascularization. Third, the
small number of patients enrolled in this study represents a
minority of all patients with AMI admitted to the participating institutions during the time the study was ongoing.
However, we believe our patients are representative of those
patients with AMI and lower hematocrit values in whom
RBC transfusion is often considered a therapeutic adjunct.
