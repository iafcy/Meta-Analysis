#### Objectives: In children with severe sepsis or septic shock, the optimal red blood cell transfusion threshold is unknown. We ana- lyzed the subgroup of patients with sepsis and transfusion require- ments in a pediatric intensive care unit study to determine the impact of a restrictive vs. liberal transfusion strategy on clinical outcome. Design: Subgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter, ran- domized, controlled trial. Setting: Multicenter pediatric critical care units. Patients: Stabilized critically ill children (mean systemic arterial pressure >2 SD below normal mean for age and cardiovascular support not increased for at least 2 hrs before enrollment) with a hemoglobin <9.5 g/dL within 7 days after pediatric critical care unit admission. Interventions: One hundred thirty-seven stabilized critically ill children with sepsis were randomized to receive red blood cell transfusion if their hemoglobin decreased to either <7.0 g/dL (restrictive group) or 9.5 g/dL (liberal group). Measurements and Main Results: In the restrictive group (69 patients), 30 patients did not receive any red blood cell transfusion,


#### whereas only one patient in the liberal group (68 patients) never underwent transfusion (p < .01). No clinically significant differences were found for the occurrence of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p � .97), for pediatric critical care unit length of stay (p � .74), or for pediatric critical care unit mortality (p � .44) in the restrictive vs. liberal group. Conclusions: In this subgroup analysis of children with stable sepsis, we found no evidence that a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy, as compared to a liberal one, increased the rate of new or progressive multiple organ dysfunction syndromes. Further- more, a restrictive transfusion threshold significantly reduced exposure to blood products. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe stabilized for children with sepsis, but further studies are required to support this recommendation.

#### their cardiac output and hemoglobin level (5). It is frequently stated by intensivists that critically ill patients with sepsis re- quire a higher hemoglobin level. In two surveys (6, 7) addressing this issue, pedi- atric intensivists replied that they prefer to maintain a high hemoglobin concen- tration in children with sepsis requiring intensive care and that sepsis would prompt them to administer red blood cell (RBC) transfusions at a higher hemoglo- bin threshold. In a landmark randomized clinical trial, Rivers et al (5) studied the efficacy of goal-directed therapy in adults with severe sepsis before they were stabi- lized and reported an improved outcome if the central venous oxygen saturation was maintained at �70% in the first 6 hrs after presentation; RBC transfusions were among the proposed means to reach a central venous oxygen saturation of 70%. The 2008 guidelines from the Surviv- ing Sepsis Campaign recommend that adults with sepsis with low venous oxy- gen saturation during the first 6 hrs of treatment should undergo transfusion to target a hematocrit �30%. Once tissue


#### hypoperfusion is resolved, the guidelines propose that the hemoglobin level be maintained between 7.0 and 9.0 g/dL; RBC transfusion is recommended if the hemoglobin decreases to �7.0 g/dL (8, 9). The previous version of the Sur- viving Sepsis guidelines in 2004 (10) rec- ommended that the hemoglobin concen- tration be kept within the normal range for age in children with severe sepsis and septic shock (�10 g/dL); no specific rec- ommendation was made for children in the more recently published guidelines (8). There is almost no evidence-based data on which to base recommendations regarding the optimal hemoglobin level for critically ill children with severe sep- sis (10). In 2007, Lacroix et al (11) published a large randomized controlled trial com- paring a transfusion threshold of 7.0 g/dL and 9.5 g/dL in stabilized critically ill children and provided evidence that the lower threshold of 7.0 g/dL was safe in this patient population. In the present subgroup analysis, we compare the effect of restrictive and liberal transfusion strat- egies on multiple organ dysfunction and

#### MATERIALS AND METHODS

_Protocol. A detailed description of the_
transfusion requirements in pediatric intensive care units (TRIPICU) results was previously reported (11). Briefly, the TRIPICU study
enrolled stabilized critically ill children from
19 tertiary care pediatric intensive care units
(PICUs) from four countries. Institutional review boards approved the study protocol, and
parental consent was obtained. The condition
of patients was considered stable if the mean
systemic arterial pressure was not �2 SD below
the normal mean for age and if cardiovascular
support (fluid, vasoactive, and inotropic
drugs) had not been increased for at least 2 hrs
before enrollment. Once stabilized, children
aged between 3 days and 14 yrs, with at least
one hemoglobin concentration �9.5 g/dL
within the first 7 days after PICU admission,
were considered for inclusion. TRIPICU study
exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1.
Participants were randomly allocated to
restrictive or liberal treatment arms. In the
restrictive group, the transfusion threshold
was hemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL, with a target
range after transfusion between 8.5 and 9.5
g/dL; in the liberal group, the threshold was
9.5 g/dL, with a target range of 11.0 to 12.0
g/dL. Only pre-storage leukocyte-reduced allogeneic RBC units were used. Transfusion
strategies were applied until intensive care
unit discharge, 28 days after randomization,
or until the time of death, whichever came
first. Temporary suspensions from the protocol were allowed during active blood loss,
emergency surgery, severe hypoxemia, or
hemodynamic instability.
The primary outcome was the proportion
of patients with development of or progression
of multiple organ dysfunction syndromes
(MODS) after randomization. MODS was defined by Proulx et al (1), and new or progressive MODS was defined by Lacroix et al (11).
New MODS was considered if a patient with no
organ dysfunction or one organ dysfunction at
randomization developed two or more organs
during the study. Progressive MODS was considered if a patient who already had MODS
(dysfunction of at least two organs) at randomization had dysfunction of at least one
other organ during the study. The secondary
outcomes included nosocomial infections
(12), mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, and PICU length of stay.
_Assignment. Randomization for the TRIPICU_
trial was centralized, with assignment data
posted on the Internet. Patients were assigned
to the study groups in blocks of two or four
that were randomly distributed and stratified
according to center and three age groups (28
days or younger, 29 to 364 days, and older
than 364 days). Physicians, nurses, and research staff were unaware of the block randomization strategy.


**Figure 1. Enrollment and outcomes. Some patients had more than one exclusion criterion. In addition**
to the causes listed for exclusion, other causes were a postconception age of less than 40 wks (69
patients), severe thrombocytopenia (68), hypoxemia (65), a decision to withhold or withdraw critical
care (59), predicted survival of �24 hrs (54), previous enrollment in the study (33), brain death (25),
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (22), hemofiltration (21), blood exchange transfusion (20),
plasmapheresis (17), an inability to receive blood products (14), and pregnancy (1).


_Blinding Procedures. The TRIPICU study_
was not blinded because this was not feasible.
Clinical staff and parents were aware of the
assignments to study groups (presence of
blood bag at the bedside, increase in hemoglobin level after transfusion), but the statistician
and members of the data and safety monitoring committee were unaware of the assignments.
_Subgroup Study. The present study is a_
subgroup analysis of septic patients enrolled
in the TRIPICU study. This subgroup analysis
was planned before the TRIPICU study was
started. Expected direction (noninferiority) of
results was stated before this subgroup analysis began.
Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) was defined by the presence of
at least two of the following criteria: (1) temperature �38°C rectal or �36°C rectal; (2)
heart rate �2 SD for age; (3) tachypnea with a
respiratory rate �2 SD for age; and (4) white
blood cell count �12 � 10[9]/L (�12,000 cells/
mm[3]) or �4 � 10[9]/L (�4,000 cells/mm[3]) or
�10% immature neutrophils. Sepsis was defined as a systemic inflammatory response
syndrome caused by an infection (positive culture from any site or clinical evidence of infection or both). Severe sepsis was defined as
sepsis with Glasgow score �15, serum lactate
level above normal, or low urine output (�1
mL/kg/hr for �2 hrs). Septic shock was defined as severe sepsis with hypotension (blood
pressure �2 SD for age) or need for inotropic
or vasopressor agents (1, 13). Sepsis, severe
sepsis, and septic shock are defined according
to Bone et al (13); categories are mutually


exclusive and the most severe was attributed
to each patient.
_Statistical Analysis. Continuous variables_
were compared using Student t test or Wilcoxon rank sum test; categorical variables
were analyzed using chi-square testing. Baseline characteristics were compared using univariate descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean � SD or as
numbers and proportions.
It was estimated that at least 626 patients
would be required to complete the original
TRIPICU study to test a noninferiority hypothesis (p � .05; power of 0.9; margin of safety,
higher 95% CI of absolute risk reduction of
10%). The present subgroup analysis involved
137 septic patients and the statistical analyses
tested noninferiority in a manner similar to
that in the original study (11). Statistical analysis of the primary outcome measure was conducted using an intent-to-treat approach; for
this analysis, we calculated 95% confidence
intervals around the absolute risk reduction in
the proportion of patients with new or progressive MODS.
All secondary analyses were conducted using an intent-to-treat approach. We compared
daily pediatric logistic organ dysfunction
scores, using the worst scores after baseline,
and the total number of organ dysfunctions
per patient. We also compared 28-day and hospital all-cause mortality, nosocomial infections, transfusion reactions, duration of mechanical ventilation, and PICU and hospital
length of stay. To determine whether a restrictive transfusion strategy decreased exposure to
RBCs, we compared the total number of trans

the two groups.
Differences were considered statistically
significant when a two-sided � level was
�0.05. No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. Data were analyzed by a biostatistician (T.D.) with SAS software (version
9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

#### RESULTS

 Patients at Admission and at Ran- domization. There were 137 septic pa- tients enrolled from 19 sites and four countries in the septic patients subgroup, representing 21.5% of all TRIPICU pa- tients: 69 were randomized to the restric- tive group and 68 were randomized to the liberal group (Fig. 1). Table 1 describes patient characteristics on PICU admis- sion. Both groups were similar with re- gard to demographic data, severity of (as measured by the Pediatric Risk of Mortal- ity score) (14) and proportion requiring mechanical ventilation. There were fewer patients with septic shock in the restric- tive compared to the liberal group (13
 [19%] vs. 21 [31%]); this difference was not statistically significant (p � .32). Ta- ble 2 describes patient characteristics at randomization, which occurred 2.3 � 1.7 days after entry into PICU. Severity of illness and need for mechanical ventila- tion were similar in both groups. Intervention. The baseline hemoglo- bin concentration at randomization was 7.9 � 1.0 in the restrictive group and 7.8 � 0.9 g/dL in the liberal group. Time between randomization and first transfu- sion was 1.3 � 2.1 days in the restrictive group vs. 0.2 � 0.4 days in the liberal group (p � .001) (Table 3). As expected, the hemoglobin level before the first transfusion was significantly lower in the restrictive group (6.6 � 0.5 vs. 7.9 � 0.9 g/dL; p � .01), as well as the lowest he- moglobin level after randomization (8.3 � 1.1 vs. 10.6 � 1.7 g/dL; p � .01). Overall, in the restrictive group, 30 patients (44%) did not receive any RBC transfusion, whereas only one patient (1%) in the liberal group did not undergo transfusion (p � .01). The median vol- ume transfused was 7.6 vs. 15.7 mL/kg, respectively (p � .01). Storage time of the transfused RBC units was similar in both the liberal and restrictive groups (14.3 � 8.3 days vs. 15.6 � 8.6 days, respectively). Eleven pa- tients in the restrictive and six in the liberal group (p � .96) were temporarily suspended from the transfusion protocol.


#### Length of suspension in the restrictive group and liberal group was 6.7 � 7.7 and 2.3 � 2.0 days, respectively. Cointer- ventions, including requirement for vaso- active drugs (proportion of patients re- ceiving at least one drug), and administration of fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, and albumin were similar in both groups.

 Primary Outcome

 Thirteen patients in the restrictive group and 13 in the liberal group had new or progressive MODS after random- ization (18.8% vs. 19.1%; p � .97) (Ta- ble 4). In this subgroup analysis, the ab- solute risk reduction was 0.3%, whereas it was 0.4% in the original study; the 95% confidence interval (�12.8% to �13.4%) was outside the 10% margin of safety agreed on for the original study. There were no differences among the 17 pa- tients who were temporarily suspended from the transfusion protocol, with the primary outcome being present in eight (72%) vs. five (67%) patients (p � .56).

 Secondary Outcomes

 There were no clinically significant differences in any of the measures of or- gan dysfunction analyzed (Table 4), in- cluding oxygenation markers and dura- tion of mechanical ventilation. There were 12 cases (17%) of nosocomial infec- tions in the restrictive group compared to 23 (34%) in the liberal group (p � .02).

#### There were no differences in the total PICU length of stay (13.2 � 8.1 vs. 13.4 � 8.4 days; p � .74) and in the PICU length of stay after randomization (7.5 � 6.3 vs. 7.1 � 6.2 days; p � .74). There were five deaths in the restrictive group and two in the liberal group in the PICU (p � .44). Two additional patients died in the re- strictive group after PICU discharge but within 28 days after randomization (p � .08).

 DISCUSSION

 In this subgroup analysis of septic pa- tients enrolled in the TRIPICU trial, an equal number of patients had new or pro- gressive MODS in both transfusion strat- egy groups. Furthermore, there were no meaningful differences for any of the sec- ondary outcomes analyzed. These results suggest that a restrictive transfusion threshold of 7.0 g/dL may be safe for hemodynamically stabilized septic pa- tients admitted to the PICU, and that the outcome for this particular subgroup of patients was similar to that of other pa- tients in the TRIPICU trial. In the Surviving Sepsis campaign pub- lished in 2008, the recommended trans- fusion strategy for septic adult patients with low central venous oxygen satura- tion, who are considered to have tissue hypoperfusion and therefore are to be un- stable, is to maintain a hematocrit level �30%; once stabilized, the recom- mended target hemoglobin level is 7.0– 9.0 g/dL.

#### ill child with severe sepsis is not known” and made no recommendations regard- ing the triggers (10). In the 2008 version of these guidelines, it is stated that “it is still unclear whether a lower transfusion trigger is safe or appropriate during the initial resuscitation of children with sep- tic shock” and again made no recommen- dations for a hemoglobin threshold for RBC transfusion (8). In the present study, children with sepsis were evaluated once they were considered stabilized. The lat- ter definition required that patients have a mean systemic arterial pressure not �2

#### increase in any cardiovascular treatment (fluids, vasoactive, and inotropic drugs) for at least 2 hrs before enrollment. Al- though this cohort of patients with sepsis did not include the most severely ill chil- dren with sepsis because TRIPICU exclu- sion criteria did not allow for their inclu- sion if unstable, it nonetheless suggests that a lower transfusion threshold may be safe for children with sepsis once stabi- lized (after the initial resuscitation phase). In addition, we found that a re- strictive strategy resulted in a two-fold reduction in the number of septic pa- tients who received a transfusion, as well as a two-fold reduction in the median volume and number of RBC transfusions, resulting in a significant reduction in ex- posure to blood products. The treatment of septic patients re- quires optimization of oxygen delivery and utilization by tissues to minimize cellular dysfunction. RBC transfusion is administered to increase the oxygen content of arterial blood and oxygen delivery to tissues; however, increasing global oxygen delivery does not always improve oxygen consumption (15–17). In sepsis and septic shock, it is well estab- lished that microcirculatory dysfunction and mitochondrial depression occur de- spite adequate global oxygen delivery, re- sulting in regional hypoxia and oxygen extraction deficit. Microcirculatory dys- function is characterized by heteroge- neous abnormalities in blood flow, with some capillaries being underperfused, whereas others have normal to abnor- mally high blood flow. Sakr et al (18) have demonstrated that patients with septic shock had abnormal small vessel perfusion initially, which improved over time only in survivors. Similarly, Trze- ciak et al (19) have shown that early mi- crocirculatory perfusion indices in severe

#### sepsis and septic shock are more mark- edly impaired in nonsurvivors compared to survivors and are associated with in- creasing severity of global cardiovascular dysfunction. In addition, Brealey et al (20) showed that mitochondrial dysfunc- tion is correlated with a less favorable outcome in sepsis. Both microcirculatory anomalies and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to the inability to increase oxygen consumption, which cannot be immedi- ately improved with RBC transfusion be- cause of the changes that occur during the storage process. Stored RBC units have decreased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and S-nitrosohemoglobin levels, which cause abnormal vasodilatory responses to hypoxemia and mismatch between local oxygen delivery through small vessels and O2 requirements in tissues (21, 22). Stored RBCs are less deformable (23), contain more extracellular ubiquitin (24) and advanced glycation end products (25), express more phosphatidylserine (26), and induce more cytokine produc- tion (27) and secretory phospholipase A2 (28). All these changes are known to have immunologic or pro-coagulant proper- ties, which may further contribute to the inability of RBC transfusion to rapidly increase tissue oxygen consumption in critically ill patients. Besides uncertainty with regard to im- provement of oxygen consumption, there are several other issues associated with transfusion of any blood product that re- quire consideration. The risks associated


#### with RBC transfusion are well established and include acute transfusion reactions (29, 30) and infectious disease transmis- sion (31); some studies even suggesting an increased incidence rate of MODS, morbidity, and mortality (32–34). In this study, we found that a restrictive trans- fusion strategy resulted in a two-fold re- duction in both the number of patients undergoing transfusion and the median volume transfused. Almost all patients (99%) in the liberal group received a transfusion compared to only 56% of those in the restrictive strategy group. Thus, a restrictive transfusion strategy allowed a significant reduction in RBC transfusion and its inherent risks without increasing the rate of new or progressive MODS, mortality, or any other MODS de- scriptor. Interestingly, our data also showed that patients in the liberal group had significantly more nosocomial infections than those in the restrictive group (23 vs. 12 cases; p � .02). Whereas other studies have show that RBC transfusions are as- sociated with increased nosocomial infec- tions (33, 35, 36), there was only a trend in the initial TRIPICU study. This might be explained by a combined effect of transfusions and septic state, a hypothe- sis supported by data suggesting that pre- existing infections and RBC transfusions are independently associated with noso- comial infections (37). One hypothesis could be that sepsis induces an immuno- modulation that renders the patient more


#### prone to contract transfusion-associated nosocomial infections. Certain limitations in our study must be recognized. First, it could be argued that the patients included in TRIPICU were stabilized and therefore did not have the most severe cases of sepsis and septic shock, because patients had to have a mean systemic arterial pressure �2 SD below the normal mean for age and no increase in cardiovascular support (fluid, vasoactive, and inotropic drugs) for at least 2 hrs before enrollment. However, our cohort of septic patients was none- theless quite ill, and half of them re- quired inotropic or vasopressor support or both, and 90% had respiratory dys- function. Second, because the TRIPICU trial protocol was written in 2000, the definitions of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock used were based on the 1992 definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians (13), which were adapted for the pediatric population by Proulx et al (1), and not the more recent 2001 definitions (38). Nevertheless, the two sets of definitions are quite similar, because the 2001 definitions use the def- inition for organ dysfunctions in children cited by Proulx et al. Third, the deaths during PICU stay and at 28 days were not significantly different between both groups, but these results should be inter- preted cautiously because the number of deaths was low. Nevertheless, no other secondary outcome measuring morbidity

#### with regard to mortality. Fourth, the in- vestigators and members of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group had a priori considered the following as a statistically significant result for the original TRI- PICU noninferiority trial: a higher 95% confidence interval for the absolute risk reduction that is lower than a 10% mar- gin of safety when comparing the propor- tion of patients with new or progressive MODS in the restrictive and liberal group. The 95% confidence interval of �12.8% does not confirm a noninferior- ity hypothesis, which is likely attributable to the fact that this subgroup analysis is underpowered to attain statistical signif- icance. Finally, the most important limi- tations of our study are the pitfalls inher- ent to any subgroup analysis that preclude the possibility of generating de- finitive conclusions and, at best, allow for hypothesis generation only (39). Hence, no definitive recommendations regarding transfusion thresholds in stabilized chil- dren with sepsis can be made. It is none- theless striking that the frequency of the primary outcome in the two transfusion groups was similar. To our knowledge, there are no other studies that have prospectively evaluated the safety of a restrictive transfusion strategy in septic patients. Furthermore, it has been shown that there are signifi- cant variations in transfusion practice patterns among pediatric critical care practitioners with respect to the thresh- old hemoglobin concentration for RBC transfusion in critically ill septic patients (6, 33). Therefore, the results reported in this article are important, even though it is a subgroup analysis. Our results are certainly generalizable because the pop- ulation is representative of North Ameri- can and European centers. Furthermore, the trial was pragmatic, allowing for sus- pension from the study protocol for unsta- ble patients and therefore reflecting real- life clinical situations of critically ill patients. The strength of these findings is enhanced by the excellent adherence to the research protocol (nearly 99% of patients in the TRIPICU study met the 80% adher- ence criterion), by the fact that no patient was lost to follow-up, and by the remark- able similarity of the results reported in the overall TRIPICU study and two other sub- group analyses of cardiac surgery (40) and general surgery patients (41).


#### In conclusion, in this subgroup anal- ysis of children with stable sepsis, we found no evidence that a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy, as compared to a liberal one, increased the rate of new or progressive MODS. Furthermore, a re- strictive transfusion threshold signifi- cantly reduced exposure to blood prod- ucts. Our data suggest that a hemoglobin level of 7.0 g/dL may be safe for children with stabilized sepsis, but further studies are required to support this recommen- dation.
