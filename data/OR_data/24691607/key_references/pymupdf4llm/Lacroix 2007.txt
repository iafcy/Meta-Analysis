**Background**
The optimal hemoglobin threshold for erythrocyte transfusions in critically ill children is unknown. We hypothesized that a restrictive transfusion strategy of using
packed red cells that were leukocyte-reduced before storage would be as safe as a liberal transfusion strategy, as judged by the outcome of multiple-organ dysfunction.

**Methods**
In this noninferiority trial, we enrolled 637 stable, critically ill children who had hemoglobin concentrations below 9.5 g per deciliter within 7 days after admission to
an intensive care unit. We randomly assigned 320 patients to a hemoglobin threshold
of 7 g per deciliter for red-cell transfusion (restrictive-strategy group) and 317 patients
to a threshold of 9.5 g per deciliter (liberal-strategy group).

**Results**
Hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at a mean (±SD) level that was 2.1±0.2 g
per deciliter lower in the restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy group
(lowest average levels, 8.7±0.4 and 10.8±0.5 g per deciliter, respectively; P<0.001). Patients in the restrictive-strategy group received 44% fewer transfusions; 174 patients
(54%) in that group did not receive any transfusions, as compared with 7 patients (2%)
in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.001). New or progressive multiple-organ dysfunction
syndrome (the primary outcome) developed in 38 patients in the restrictive-strategy
group, as compared with 39 in the liberal-strategy group (12% in both groups) (absolute risk reduction with the restrictive strategy, 0.4%; 95% confidence interval, –4.6
to 5.4). There were 14 deaths in each group within 28 days after randomization. No
significant differences were found in other outcomes, including adverse events.

**Conclusions**
In stable, critically ill children a hemoglobin threshold of 7 g per deciliter for red-cell
transfusion can decrease transfusion requirements without increasing adverse outcomes. (Controlled-trials.com number, ISRCTN37246456.)

p to 50% of children who are hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU)
receive red-cell transfusions,[1,2] yet children

# Uwhose condition is stable may tolerate the de
creased oxygen delivery associated with a moderate degree of anemia. On the one hand, transfusions containing leukocytes could have limited
benefit in such children and might result in organ
dysfunction through stimulation of the inflammatory cascade by the transfused leukocytes.[3] On the
other hand, children in the ICU could benefit from
transfusions because of enhanced oxygen delivery,
just as adults with early septic shock benefit from
transfusions.[4]

A randomized trial involving 838 critically ill
adults suggested that a restrictive transfusion
strategy may be superior to a liberal strategy.[5]
There are no data from rigorous trials to guide
transfusion decisions in critically ill children. Several surveys of pediatric intensivists have recently
documented large variations in stated[6,7] and observed[1,2] practices with respect to red-cell transfusion.

Universal leukocyte reduction, recently introduced in many countries, may decrease the proinflammatory effects of transfusions.[8] We postulated that a restrictive transfusion strategy with the
use of prestorage leukocyte-reduced red-cell units
(i.e., red cells that have first been filtered to remove leukocytes and have then been stored in
the usual manner) in stable, critically ill children
would substantially decrease exposure to transfusions without worsening organ dysfunction.


Methods


**Patients and Sites**
We enrolled patients at 19 tertiary-care pediatric
ICUs in four countries (see the Appendix). Stable,
critically ill children between 3 days and 14 years
of age who had at least one hemoglobin concentration of 9.5 g per deciliter or less within the first
7 days after admission to the pediatric ICU were
eligible for enrollment. The condition of patients
was considered stable if the mean systemic arterial
pressure was not less than 2 SD below the normal
mean for age and if cardiovascular treatments had
not been increased for at least 2 hours before enrollment. All consecutive children were screened.
Exclusion criteria are listed in Figure 1. The study
protocol was approved by the research ethics board
at each participating institution, and for all pa

tients, written informed consent was obtained from
a parent or surrogate decision maker.

**Study Design and Treatment Protocols**
Randomization was centralized, with assignment
data posted on the Internet. Patients were assigned
to the study groups in blocks of 2 or 4 that were
randomly distributed and stratified according to
center and three age groups (≤28 days, 29 to 364
days, and >364 days). Physicians, nurses, and research staff were unaware of the block-randomization strategy.

In the restrictive-strategy group, the hemoglobin threshold for transfusion was set at 7 g per
deciliter, with a target range after transfusion of
8.5 to 9.5 g per deciliter. In the liberal-strategy
group, the threshold was 9.5 g per deciliter, with
a target range of 11 to 12 g per deciliter. In both
groups, red cells were transfused within 12 hours
after the threshold value had been reached. Redcell transfusions were administered in accordance
with a formula that accounted for the patient’s
weight and the average hemoglobin concentration in red-cell units at each participating site.
Only prestorage leukocyte-reduced red-cell units
were used.

Attending physicians followed strategies for
red-cell transfusion outlined for each group. No
other clinical care protocols were used in the
study. The transfusion protocol was applied for up
to 28 days of the stay in the pediatric ICU or until the time of death, whichever occurred first. The
protocol could be temporarily suspended, at the
discretion of the attending physician, during periods of active and clinically significant blood loss,
surgical intervention, severe hypoxemia, or hemodynamic instability and was promptly resumed
once the condition of the patient no longer fulfilled the suspension criteria. Suspensions were
not considered a breach of adherence to the protocol. Data monitoring and collection were unchanged during suspension. Clinical staff and
parents were aware of the assignments to study
groups, but the statistician and members of the
data and safety monitoring committee were unaware of the assignments.

**Baseline Assessment, Monitoring,**
**and Outcome Measures**
Baseline assessments were undertaken at the time
of randomization. Hemoglobin concentrations, the
number of red-cell transfusions, the types of med

ications given, the use of mechanical ventilation
and dialysis, and surgical interventions were recorded daily during the 28-day follow-up period.
Hemoglobin concentrations were measured at least
once within 6 hours after every red-cell transfusion.
Data were collected by trained study personnel.

The primary outcome was the proportion of
patients who died during the 28 days after randomization, had concurrent dysfunction of two or
more organ systems (termed multiple-organ-dysfunction syndrome, or MODS), or had progression
of MODS, as evidenced by the worsening of one
or more organ dysfunctions, as defined by Proulx
et al.[9] We also collected information on a number
of secondary outcomes, including daily scores on
Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD)
assessment,[10] sepsis,[9] transfusion reactions,[11] nosocomial respiratory infections,[12] catheter-related
infections,[13] adverse events, length of stay in the
ICU and hospital, and mortality. Established diagnostic criteria were used.[9,11-13]

**Statistical Analysis**
We estimated that we would need to enroll at least
626 children in order to detect an absolute reduction of 10 percent in the risk of new or progressive
organ dysfunction in the group treated according
to the restrictive transfusion strategy, with an overall one-sided alpha of 5% and a power of 90%.[14,15]

One planned interim safety analysis was undertaken by a blinded, independent data and safety
monitoring board after 50% of patients had been
enrolled. Only unexpected rates of death, adverse
events, and nosocomial infections were considered, and no statistical analysis was done. The
board recommended continuation of the trial.

We compared the two groups with respect to
the total number of transfusions per patient and
the proportion of patients who did not have redcell transfusions after randomization. We used
analysis of variance with repeated measures to
highlight differences in hemoglobin concentrations over time. We then calculated the number
needed to treat to prevent one red-cell transfusion
in the restrictive group.

The statistical analysis of the primary outcome
measure was conducted with the use of an intention-to-treat approach. We calculated the 95%
confidence interval (CI) for the absolute risk reduction[16] in the proportion of patients with new
or progressive MODS. We established a priori that
we would infer that a restrictive strategy was not


inferior to a liberal strategy for red-cell transfusions if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the absolute reduction in the risk of the primary outcome
did not exceed a 10% margin of safety.[17] We generated Kaplan–Meier curves and used the log-rank
test to compare the time to the development of
new or progressive organ failure in the two groups.
We calculated adjusted odds ratios for treatment
effects with the use of logistic regression; the multivariate model included age, country, and score
on the Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) assessment.[18] To minimize the probability of missing
true differences, we also conducted a per-protocol
analysis of the primary outcome in patients who
met or exceeded an 80% rate of adherence to the
protocol for red-cell transfusion. Adherence was
defined as the proportion of days after randomization on which at least one hemoglobin concentration was over the transfusion threshold.

All analyses of secondary outcomes were based
on the intention-to-treat principle. We compared
daily PELOD scores, using the worst scores after
baseline, the average total number of organs that
were dysfunctional per patient, and other secondary outcomes listed above. Continuous variables
were compared with the use of the Student t-test or
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Categorical variables
were analyzed with the use of the chi-square test.

We examined subgroups of patients who were
at potential risk for adverse effects of anemia, categorized according to diagnosis, age, severity of
illness (as estimated by the PRISM score), country,
and study status (i.e., whether patients had been
temporarily suspended from the trial).

Continuous data are expressed as means ±SD.
We report two-sided 95% CIs and P values. No
adjustments of P values were made for multiple
comparisons. Data were analyzed with SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute).


**Patients and Treatment Assignment**
From November 26, 2001, to August 28, 2005,
a total of 5399 children had a hemoglobin concentration of 9.5 g per deciliter or less during the first
7 days of admission to the ICU and were eligible for
inclusion. Of these children, 4372 (81%) met at least
one exclusion criterion (Fig. 1). For 379 of the remaining 1027 patients (37%), the parents or surrogate decision makers declined to provide consent.
We therefore randomly assigned 648 children to

(320 in the restrictive-strategy group and 317 in the
liberal-strategy group) in the intention-to-treat
analyses. Patients in the two study groups had similar characteristics at baseline (Table 1).


**Intervention**

Hemoglobin concentrations at the time of randomization were similar in the restrictive-strategy group
and the liberal-strategy group (8.0±1.0 vs. 8.0±0.9 g
per deciliter). There were significant differences
between the groups in the time until the first trans

‡ The number is for all transfusions after randomization, including those given during suspension; 71 transfusions in

the restrictive-strategy group and 61 in the liberal-strategy group were given while patients were suspended from the
study. One patient in the liberal-strategy group received 29 transfusions during study suspension.

fusion (1.7 vs. 0.1 days) and in the hemoglobin
concentration before the first transfusion (6.7±0.5
vs. 8.1±0.1 g per deciliter) (P<0.001 for both comparisons) (Table 2). The hemoglobin concentrations
were maintained above the threshold more than
94% of the time, with an average difference of
2.1±0.2 g per deciliter between the restrictive-strategy group and the liberal-strategy group (overall
average lowest levels, 8.7±0.4 and 10.8±0.5 g per
deciliter, respectively) until discharge from the pediatric ICU (P<0.001) (Fig. 1 of the Supplementary
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org).

The protocol was temporarily suspended for 59
patients: 39 in the restrictive-strategy group and
20 in the liberal-strategy group (Table 2). Overall,
301 transfusions were administered in the restrictive-strategy group, as compared with 542 in the
liberal-strategy group (a 44% decrease in the restrictive-strategy group, P<0.001); 71 and 61 transfusions, respectively, were given while strict transfusion protocols were temporarily suspended.

In the restrictive-strategy group, 174 patients
(54%) received no red-cell transfusions, as compared with 7 patients (2%) in the liberal-strategy


group (P<0.001). Children in the restrictive-strategy group were also exposed to fewer transfusions than were children in the liberal-strategy
group (0.9±2.6 vs. 1.7±2.2 transfusions per patient,
P<0.001). With the restrictive protocol, the number needed to treat in order to prevent one red-cell
transfusion was two patients. Cointerventions were
similar in the two groups before and after randomization (Table 2).

**Primary Outcome**
The number of patients with new or progressive
MODS after randomization was 38 in the restrictive-strategy group and 39 in the liberal-strategy
group (12% of both groups). The absolute reduction in risk was 0.4% (95% CI, –4.6 to 5.5 with the
restrictive strategy); the upper limit of the 95% CI
did not exceed 10%.

The risk of new or progressive MODS increased
with the severity of illness, as reflected by the
PRISM score, in both groups (Table 3). The timeto-event analysis for new or progressive MODS
generated a hazard ratio of 0.95 for the restrictive
transfusion strategy as compared with the liberal
strategy (95% CI, 0.61 to 1.49; P = 0.84).

**Secondary Analyses**

None of the measures of the severity of organ dysfunction differed significantly between the two
groups (Table 3). The number of deaths 28 days
after randomization was the same in the two
groups (14). No significant differences were observed with respect to nosocomial infections, mechanical ventilation, the duration of the stay in the
ICU, or reactions to red-cell transfusion. There were
221 adverse events in the restrictive-strategy group
and 203 in the liberal-strategy group (P = 0.44); of
those events, 28 and 22, respectively, were serious
adverse events (P = 0.42). Patients with one or more
adverse events included 97 in the restrictive-strategy group and 90 in the liberal-strategy group
(P = 0.59), and 19 patients in each group had one


or more serious adverse events (P = 0.98). A complete list of adverse events can be found in the Supplementary Appendix.

We also performed a per-protocol analysis of
the primary outcome.[19] A total of nearly 99% of
patients met the 80% adherence criterion, and the
results of the per-protocol analysis differed only
slightly from those of the intention-to-treat analysis (absolute risk reduction with the restrictive
strategy, 0.8%; 95% CI, –4.3 to 5.9).

† The comparison between the restrictive-strategy group and the liberal-strategy group is given as an absolute reduction in risk.
‡ Noninferiority (NI) was checked only for the primary outcome (the number of patients who had new or progressive multiple-organ-dys
function syndrome [MODS], including death, after randomization). The absolute risk reduction for new or progressive MODS in the restrictive-strategy group versus the liberal-strategy group was 0.4% (two-sided 95% CI, –4.6 to 5.5) by intention-to-treat analysis; we also
calculated a two-sided 97.5% CI of –5.4 to 6.2. Some experts also consider that a per-protocol analysis should be done in a noninferiority
trial. In the per-protocol analysis, we excluded 11 patients who did not meet the 80% adherence criterion; the number of patients with the
primary outcome was 37 of 319 (11.6%) in the restrictive-strategy group and 38 of 307 (12.4%) in the liberal-strategy group (absolute risk
reduction, 0.8%; two-sided 95% CI, –4.3 to 5.9). In all analyses, the upper limit of the confidence interval was lower than the safety margin
of error of 10% approved by consensus before the study was undertaken, which means that noninferiority was statistically significant.

** Scores on the Paediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction (PELOD) assessment range from 0 to 71, with higher scores indicating more severe

organ dysfunction. The PELOD score can be estimated over the entire stay in the ICU or over 1 day (daily PELOD). The change in the
PELOD score is the difference between the daily PELOD score at study entry and the worst daily PELOD score thereafter. Patients whose
PELOD score did not change or decreased after randomization were considered to have a change of 0.


96% reduction in the number of patients who had
any transfusion exposure and a 44% decrease in
the number of red-cell transfusions administered,
without increasing the rates of new or progressive MODS, in stable, critically ill children. There
were also no clinically important differences between the two groups in any secondary outcomes.

Our study showed that a restrictive transfusion
strategy was safe in pediatric patients whose condition was stable in the ICU and that such a strategy was as safe as a liberal transfusion strategy.
However, outcomes in critically ill adults differ
from our findings in children. In a trial of two
transfusion strategies in critically ill adults, the
rates of worsening organ failure and other complications were significantly higher with a liberal
transfusion strategy.[5] This study in adults also
documented more in-hospital deaths in the liberal-strategy group than in the restrictive-strategy
group, whereas the number of deaths was the same
with the two strategies in our pediatric patients
(14 in each group).


The differences between our results and those
in adults may be due to several factors. First, critically ill adults may be more vulnerable than critically ill children to adverse consequences of redcell transfusions. Second, the trial in adults did
not use prestorage leukocyte-reduced red cells, as
were used in our trial. Leukocytes in transfused
red cells may harm vulnerable patients by generating cytokines and activating an inflammatory
response.[20-24] Two randomized trials involving
adults who had vascular disease or who had undergone cardiac surgery showed decreased rates
of organ dysfunction in patients receiving leukocyte-reduced red cells.[25,26] In addition, two beforeand-after trials that evaluated a universal prestorage leukocyte-reduction program showed reduced
rates of febrile episodes among more than 14,000
adults[27] and decreased rates of post-transfusion
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants.[8] Hence, in our study, prestorage leukocyte reduction may have helped prevent harmful

effects of transfusions, especially in the liberal
group.

Three smaller trials in pediatric subpopulations
have also evaluated various transfusion strategies.
In a trial involving 147 pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a hematocrit of 21% during cardiopulmonary bypass was associated with
a poor neurodevelopmental outcome, as compared
with a hematocrit of 27%.[28] In a subgroup of patients in a study of 100 preterm infants who were
randomly assigned to a restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy, the risk of intraparenchymal brain
hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and apnea was higher in the restrictive-strategy group.[29]
In a trial that included 451 premature infants who
were randomly assigned to a restrictive or liberal
transfusion strategy, the rate of death or severe
morbidity was 2.6 percentage points higher in the
restrictive-strategy group, but the difference was
not significant.[30] From published reports, it is unclear whether red cells underwent prestorage leukocyte reduction in these three pediatric trials.

To minimize potential biases, we concealed
treatment assignments, ensured complete followup, and assessed objective clinical outcomes. We
lost only 11 patients to follow-up (2%), a rate low
enough to prevent any bias attributable to samplesize slippage.[31] Despite varying practice patterns
before this study, the adherence rates in the many
participating centers exceeded 97% in both groups.
Inferences related to clinical outcomes derived
from this study are strengthened by the consistency of observations in both primary and secondary outcomes and across major subgroups. We did
note that in the restrictive-strategy group, there
were significantly more suspensions of the transfusion-threshold protocol, which may reflect the
uneasiness of attending physicians about maintaining very sick patients at low hemoglobin concentrations. Suspensions were a result of the acute
respiratory distress syndrome, worsened shock, or
increased bleeding but did not cause these complications. Despite the increased number of sus

pensions, we nevertheless documented a significant reduction in the number of red-cell units
transfused in the restrictive group.

Our trial had at least one limitation. Although
death is the reference outcome in studies of critically ill adults, the low mortality rate among children — only about 4%[10] — would not allow us
to design a study with sufficient power to detect
a meaningful change in death rates. In critical care
medicine, organ failure is a clinically significant
outcome.[32] We used a composite of death and development of new or progressive organ failure,
which should be relevant to pediatric intensivists.

In conclusion, we found that a restrictive transfusion strategy can safely decrease the rate of exposure to red cells as well as the total number of
transfusions in critically ill children, even though
suspensions of transfusion strategies were permitted under prespecified conditions. We were unable
to detect meaningful differences in any clinical
outcomes, both overall and among all subgroups
examined. We recommend a restrictive transfusion
strategy in pediatric patients whose condition is
stable in the ICU. This recommendation, however,
is not applicable to premature infants, older adults,
patients with coronary artery disease, or children
with severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability,
active blood loss, or cyanotic heart disease.
