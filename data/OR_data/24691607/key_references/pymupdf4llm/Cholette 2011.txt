**_Objective: To examine the impact of a restrictive vs. liberal_**
**transfusion strategy on arterial lactate and oxygen content dif-**
**ferences in children with single-ventricle physiology post cavo-**
**pulmonary connection. Children with single-ventricle physiology**
**are routinely transfused postoperatively to increase systemic**
**oxygen delivery, and transfusion thresholds in this population**
**have not been studied.**
**_Design: Prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial._**
**_Setting: Pediatric cardiac intensive care unit in a teaching_**
**hospital.**
**_Patients: Infants and children (n �_** **60) with variations of single-**
**ventricle physiology presenting for cavopulmonary connection.**
**_Interventions: Subjects were randomized to a restrictive (he-_**
**moglobin of <9.0 g/dL), or liberal (hemoglobin of >13.0 g/dL)**
**transfusion strategy for 48 hrs post operation. Primary outcome**
**measures were mean and peak arterial lactate. Secondary end**
**points were arteriovenous (C(a-v)O2) and arteriocerebral oxygen**
**content (C(a-c)O2) differences and clinical outcomes.**
**_Measurements and Main Results: A total of 30 children were in_**
**each group. There were no significant preoperative differences.**


**Mean hemoglobin in the restrictive and liberal groups were 11 �**
**1.3 g/dL and 13.9 �** **0.5 g/dL, respectively (p < .01). No differ-**
**ences in mean (1.4 �** **0.5 mmol/L [Restrictive] vs. 1.4 �** **0.4**
**mmol/L [Liberal]) or peak (3.1 �** **1.5 mmol/L [Restrictive] vs.**
**3.2 �** **1.3 mmol/L [Liberal]) lactate between groups were found.**
**Mean number of red blood cell transfusions were 0.43 �** **0.6 and**
**2.1 �** **1.2 (p < .01), and donor exposure was 1.2 �** **0.7 and 2.4 �**
**1.1 to (p < .01), for each group, respectively. No differences were**
**found in C(a-v)O2, C(a-c)O2, or clinical outcome measures.**
**_Conclusion: Children with single-ventricle physiology do not_**
**benefit from a liberal transfusion strategy after cavopulmonary**
**connection. A restrictive red blood cell transfusion strategy**
**decreases the number of transfusions, donor exposures, and**
**potential risks in these children. Larger studies with clinical**

commonly transfused to higher hemoglobin levels to increase their oxygencarrying capacity, particularly post cardiac surgery and during periods of
cardiorespiratory stress (1–3).
Children with complex congenital
heart disease often require palliative interventions that maintain intracardiac
mixing lesions and cyanosis. Postoperatively, these children are relatively anemic and may have poor cardiac function.
Practitioners typically maintain elevated
hemoglobin concentrations in these
children immediately post palliative
procedures for concern that they cannot increase their cardiac output to
compensate for low systemic oxygen delivery (2, 3). The risk/benefit ratio of this
practice is unknown, and clinical practice
varies greatly (4, 5).
Given the cost and risks of blood product administration in critically ill


adults (6, 7) and children (8) and the evidence that a restrictive transfusion strategy in critically ill adults (9) and children (10) is well tolerated, it is important
to determine whether children with cardiac disease and those undergoing cardiac surgery (specifically for singleventricle physiology) can tolerate relative
anemia. Subgroup analysis (11) of the
transfusion requirements in a pediatric
intensive care (TRIPICU) study that focused on children post cardiac surgery
found no difference in new or progressive
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (primary outcome variable) in the restrictive
vs. liberal group; however, patients with
cyanotic heart disease and those having
palliative interventions (including Bidirectional Glenn [BDG] and Fontan procedures) were excluded.
We hypothesize that a restrictive strategy of RBC transfusion is as effective as,

tension unresponsive to crystalloid or colloid
infusion; poor perfusion and/or worsening oxygenation).
Prestorage leukocyte-reduced, irradiated
RBC units were used for all transfusions.
When possible, RBC units were split to reduce
donor exposure. RBC transfusions were typically given rapidly for �3 hrs at the discretion
of the intensivist. RBC transfusions were begun within 1 hr of reaching the hemoglobin
threshold. The transfusion protocol was applied for the first 48 hrs of PCICU admission.
The protocol could be suspended at the discretion of the cardiac intensivist for hemodynamic instability, refractory hypoxemia, active
bleeding, and/or need for surgical intervention. Clinical staff and patient families were
aware of transfusion group assignment; the
independent data safety monitor was blinded
to the assignment.
Transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, and/or cryoprecipitate was performed as
clinically indicated for both groups. According
to our practice, all subjects received aspirin
daily beginning on the first postoperative day.
In addition, subjects having Fontan procedures were begun on warfarin once patients
were tolerating oral medications (goal international normalized ratio, 2–2.5).
_Ongoing Measurements. Hemoglobin con-_
centration, PaO2, SaO2 SvO2, rSO2, mean arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure
proximal to the BDG or Fontan, and blood
lactate were measured at PCICU admission
and every 4 hrs for 48 hrs. Arterial, venous,
and cerebral oxygen content (from rSO2 values) was derived from established formulas
and C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 were calculated.
_Outcome Measures. Mean and peak arterial_
lactate level during the initial 48 hrs were the
primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes were the C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 and clinical outcomes (length of mechanical ventilation, length and dose of vasoactive agent
administration, PCICU and hospital length of
stay, mediastinal tube drainage, and volume of
crystalloid and albumin infused during the
study period).
_Statistical Analysis. Sample size calcula-_
tions were performed before initiating the
study. We defined the two treatments as equivalent if the mean and peak lactate during the
study period did not differ by �2 mmol/L.
Based on our experience, we expected the SD of
arterial lactate to be 1.5 mmol/L. We set type
I error rate to 0.05. Based on these assumptions, we determined that 29 subjects would
be needed per group to have 80% power to
reject the null hypothesis.
Primary analysis compared mean and peak
arterial lactate levels between each treatment
group. Data from each time point for each
variable were collated, and the mean, median,
and SD values were determined. Comparisons
were made, using analysis of variance and Student’s t tests for normally distributed data. For


ventricle physiology undergoing cavopulmonary connection. Our primary aim is
to compare peak and mean arterial lactate in children post cavopulmonary connection randomized to a restrictive vs.
liberal transfusion protocol. Our secondary aims are to compare surrogate measures of oxygen delivery, specifically the
arteriovenous and arteriocerebral oxygen
content differences, and clinical outcomes between transfusion groups.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

_Subjects. Infants and children presenting_
to the University of Rochester Medical Center
for elective partial or total cavopulmonary
connection (BDG or Fontan procedures) were
eligible. Children were excluded only if consent could not be obtained. The protocol was
approved by the University of Rochester
Medical Center Research Subjects Review
Board and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov
(NCT00350220). Interim review was performed
every 6 months by an independent medical
safety monitor.
Subjects were enrolled at their preanesthesia visit. Properly witnessed and documented
informed consent was obtained from a parent/
guardian. Once enrolled, subjects were divided
into those having BDG or Fontan procedures,
and block randomization (block size 8) was
used to randomize subjects to either the restrictive or liberal transfusion strategy (stratified randomization). The transfusion strategy
was initiated on postoperative admission to
the pediatric cardiac intensive care unit
(PCICU) and continued until 48 hrs from the
time of admission after which RBC transfusions were utilized, according to current best
practice at University of Rochester Medical
Center.
_Baseline Assessment. Baseline measures_
were collected at the time of surgery. Preoperative hemoglobin concentration, partial
pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2),
arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), and regional cerebral
oxygen saturation (rSO2) were collected. Left
forehead cerebral oximeters, using the INVOS
system (Somanetics Inc., Troy, MI), were utilized for rSo2 measurements. These data were
also collected in the operating room after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Surgical details
and intraoperative use of blood products were
recorded.
_Surgical_ _Procedures._ A single surgeon (G.M.A.) performed all surgeries. Cavopulmonary connection was achieved with a
BDG or Fontan procedure. In general, BDG
was done as part of a staged correction that
ultimately would lead to Fontan. The BDG
directed superior vena caval blood flow to the
confluent pulmonary arteries. The Fontan was
an extracardiac, total cavopulmonary connec

ripheral Vascular Inc., Tempe, AZ; or W. L.
Gore & Associates Inc., Flagstaff, AZ). The
extracardiac total cavopulmonary connection
included a 4–5 mm fenestration between the
polytetrafluoroethylene graft and the lateral
wall of the right atrium. CPB was established,
using single arterial, bicaval cannulation. All
patients were maintained at normothermia.
Aortic cross-clamping with global myocardial
ischemia was rarely necessary.
The Terumo RX05 oxygenator (Terumo
Cardiovascular Systems, Ann Arbor, MI) was
used for subjects weighing �10 kg, and the
Terumo RX15 oxygenator was used for subjects weighing �10 kg. Red blood cells (RBCs)
were used in the CPB prime for infants wighing �10 kg. All patients were managed intraoperatively on CPB with unfractionated heparin adjusted according to activated clotting
times and reversed with protamine. All patients on CPB received epsilon aminocaproic
acid.
Additional RBC, platelets, fresh-frozen
plasma, and/or cryoprecipitate were given at
the discretion of the cardiac surgeon and anesthesiologist. Central venous and arterial
catheters and mediastinal drainage tubes were
placed in the operating room. Vasoactive
medications (epinephrine and/or dopamine
and/or milrinone) were utilized to maintain
hemodynamics during transition off CPB at
the discretion of the cardiac surgical team. All
patients remained intubated and sedated for
transfer to the PCICU.
_PCICU Procedures. All subjects received_
current PCICU standard of care aside from
their transfusion strategy. Subjects were
weaned from mechanical ventilation and extubated as their cardiopulmonary status allowed. Crystalloid and/or 5% albumin were
infused in 10–20 mL/kg boluses for clinical
findings of hypovolemia and poor cardiac output (i.e., tachycardia, poor pulses and perfusion, low urine output and/or hypotension)
as needed to maintain hemodynamic stability. Vasoactive agents were adjusted to
maintain hemodynamics and end-organ perfusion. Subjects were transferred to the general inpatient units once they no longer
required intensive care.
_Transfusion Strategy. The cardiac sur-_
geon, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, and operating room staff were blinded to study assignment. Transfusion of blood products in the
operating room, both on and off CPB, proceeded as per standard practice. The study
protocol was initiated at the time of PCICU
admission.
_Liberal Transfusion Group. The liberal_
transfusion group required 10 mL/kg of RBCs
for any hemoglobin of �13.0 g/dL regardless
of whether there was a clinical indication for
transfusion.
_Restrictive Transfusion Group. The restric-_
tive transfusion group required 10 mL/kg of
RBCs for any hemoglobin of �9.0 g/dL accom

Whitney tests were performed. A p � .05 was
considered statistically significant. The z tests
of two proportions were calculated to compare
proportions; a z score ��2.0 or �2.0 was
considered statistically significant.
All subject data were analyzed at study
completion in the manner of “intention-totreat” to ensure proper statistical interpretation of the study results. The statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used for all
statistical analyses.

**RESULTS**

From August 2006 to September 2009,
63 children were eligible for study participation. Sixty-two children and families
agreed to participate and gave informed
consent. Thirty-one subjects were randomized to each group. One subject in
each group was unable to have surgery
performed and was excluded. One could
not be endotracheally intubated secondary to Klipple Feil syndrome, and the
other had bleeding complications before
going on CPB. Thirty subjects underwent
surgery and completed study procedures.
No subjects dropped out of the study, and
none was lost to follow-up. Adherence to
data collection for each study variable
was �97% with missed data points due to
discontinuation of arterial and/or venous
access. There was 100% compliance with
study procedures; the protocol was never
suspended. All transfusions were initiated
�60 mins of meeting transfusion criteria.
Thirty-three (55%) subjects underwent BDG, and 27 (45%) underwent the
Fontan procedure. Fifty-nine (98.3%)
cases were performed on CPB. The one
case performed off CPB was a BDG randomized to the liberal group. Mean CPB
time was 75 � 35 mins. No subjects required reexploration for bleeding. There
were no significant differences in baseline
characteristics between groups, or admission hemoglobin, lactate, and oxygen
saturations (Table 1).
_Arterial Lactate Levels. Mean (restric-_
tive: 1.4 � 0.5 mmol/L; liberal: 1.4 � 0.4
mmol/L) and peak (restrictive: 3.1 � 1.5
mmol/L; liberal: 3.2 � 1.3 mmol/L) arterial lactate levels were similar between the
two treatment groups (Table 2; Fig. 1).
_Oxygen Utilization. C(a-v)O2 (restric-_
tive: 3.86 � 1; liberal: 4.15 � 0.09; p �
.234) and C(a-c)O2 (restrictive: 2.77 �
1.07; liberal: 2.72 � 0.91; p � .84) did not
differ between the study groups. Similarly, when the largest differences for
each patient over the 48 hrs were com

pared between groups, no statistically
significant differences were found (restrictive: 5.74 � 1.64; liberal: 6.36 �
1.42; p � .119) and C(a-c)O2 (restrictive:
4.13 � 1.4; liberal: 4.42 � 1.27; p �
.417). Both analyses showed a nonsignificant trend to a narrower C(a-v)O2 in restrictive patients (Fig. 2). Table 3 summarizes the data used in these
calculations.

There was no substantial difference in the
results when these five subjects were removed from analysis.
Twenty-nine (96.6%) restrictive subjects at one time point had a measured
hemoglobin of �13.0 g/dL and would
have received at least one additional RBC
transfusion had they been assigned to the
liberal group. The mean number of donor
exposures (including RBCs given in the
OR) was different between groups (restrictive: 1.2 � 0.7; liberal: 2.4 � 1.1, p � .01).
_Clinical Outcomes. Although not pow-_
ered to test for statistical differences,
mortality, PCICU and hospital length of
stay, duration of mechanical ventilation,
dose and duration of inotropic support,
total colloid infusion, coagulant product
infusions, and total mediastinal tube
drainage were similar between subject
groups. There was a trend toward increased crystalloid infusion in the restrictive group (27.1 mL/kg vs. 14.6 mL/kg;
_p �_ .07) (Table 2). One subject in the
liberal transfusion strategy died on postoperative day 39 from staphlycoccal sepsis. No restrictive strategy subjects died.
_Subgroup Analysis of BDG and Fon-_
_tan Subjects. Although not powered to_
test for statistical differences, subgroup
analysis of BDG and Fontan subjects revealed similar results (Table 4). Peak and
mean arterial lactate and mean C(a-c)O2
did not differ between study groups for
subjects specifically receiving BDG or
Fontan procedures. In BDG subjects,
mean C(a-v)O2 was significantly lower in
the restrictive group (restrictive: 3.6 �
0.5; liberal: 4.2 � 0.9; p � .04). These
results were not duplicated in Fontan
subjects (restrictive: 4.2 � 1.3; liberal:
4.1 � 0.9; p � .89).

Despite their uniquely compromised
physiology, children with single-ventricle
physiology and lower hemoglobin concentrations were able to maintain adequate tissue oxygen delivery post cavopulmonary connection and did not seem
to benefit from a liberal transfusion strategy. Mean and peak arterial lactate levels
were similar in children managed with a
restrictive and liberal transfusion strategy. The adverse effects of RBC transfusions are well described (12–14), and
those subjects maintained at higher hemoglobin concentrations received
greater numbers of RBC transfusions, do

nor exposures, and risk of RBC transfusions without apparent clinical benefit.
Peak and mean arterial lactate were
selected as primary outcome measures as
use of a primary clinical outcome measure (such as illness severity scores)
would be less sensitive to subtle changes
and require subject numbers that would
necessitate multicentered participation.
Lactate was chosen as it is an easily available, objective, and reliable marker of illness severity, indicating circulatory compromise and inadequate oxygen delivery
and/or utilization (15–18). Serial lactate
levels have been found to correlate with
morbidity and mortality post pediatric
cardiac surgery (19–24). The mean arte

rial lactate level over 48 hrs represented a
rough summation of hemodynamics during the period, whereas the peak level
represented the worst hemodynamics of
the period. Venous and regional oxygen
saturations were collected to serve as surrogate measures of oxygen delivery and to
generate C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2 differences as indices of cardiac output and
cerebral blood flow.
Measures of SvO2 and rSO2 were lower
in the restrictive group, and although
statistically significant, it is unclear
whether these differences are clinically
important. Additional studies with larger
subject numbers and long-term follow-up
data that explore for an association be

mental outcomes are warranted. In the
restrictive group, CaO2, CvO2, and CcO2
were lower as a consequence of lower
hemoglobin concentrations, but significant increases in C(a-v)O2 and C(a-c)O2
were not found. When combined with
stable blood lactate levels, this suggests
that children in the restrictive group
were not disadvantaged by their lower
CaO2, and were able to maintain adequate
tissue oxygen delivery and utilization.
This study did not specifically examine
the effect of hemoglobin on systemic and
pulmonary vascular resistance. Data regarding heart rate, urine output, capillary
refill, and perfusion would provide additional information regarding the hemodynamics of each subject. As this population is dependent on low pulmonary
vascular resistance for pulmonary blood
flow, the effect of the hemoglobin level
on pulmonary vascular resistance would
be interesting to compare. It is unlikely
that the liberal group had a clinically
relevant elevation in their pulmonary
vascular resistance from higher hemoglobin levels, as they did not demonstrate
significantly lower SaO2 or PaO2 levels.
There was a numeric but not statistically significant increase in length of mechanical ventilation, duration and degree
of inotropic support, and length of stay in
the restrictive group. As this study was
not powered to assess for clinical outcome differences, it is possible that, with
larger subject numbers, these differences
would become significant. The restrictive
group did receive larger volumes of crystalloid infusion compared with the liberal
group, which potentially contributed to
increased pulmonary edema and duration
of mechanical ventilation.
This is the only randomized controlled
trial to examine the postoperative transfusion threshold in children with singleventricle physiology undergoing surgical
palliation. There was no selection bias as
all subjects presenting for cavopulmonary connection were considered eligible,
and 98% of eligible subjects were included. As the exclusion criteria consisted only of inability to obtain consent,
no complicating or preexisting clinical
condition prevented study participation.
As the research protocol was initiated immediately at the time of admission to the
PCICU, there was no requirement for patient “stabilization”; therefore, the most
severely ill or compromised subjects were
included. Study findings are further sup

herence to the transfusion strategy, and
no subjects were lost to follow-up.
Strengths of the study design include
the focus on the immediate postoperative
period where the potential for low cardiac
output syndrome and bleeding complications is the highest, and when RBC transfusions are most likely to be administered. The one other study to examine
transfusion thresholds post pediatric cardiac surgery (the TRIPICU subgroup
analysis) included subjects within 7 days
after pediatric intensive care unit admission (presumably up to 7 days post operation), possibly outside the period of
greatest risk for hemodynamic compromise, bleeding, and need for RBC transfusion (20). An additional strength of this
study is the frequency at which data were
obtained. Hemoglobin concentration was
measured every 4 hrs, and all transfusions were initiated within an hour of
reaching the transfusion threshold, thus
ensuring that liberal group subjects were
maintained consistently over the hemoglobin threshold of 13 g/dL.
The major limitation of this study is
that the difference in mean hemoglobin
between the two treatment groups was
not larger. Subjects were admitted to the
PCICU with a mean hemoglobin of 12
g/dL, and in the absence of significant
bleeding, many restrictive group subjects
maintained their hemoglobin well �9
g/dL, decreasing the between-group difference. However, the aim of this study
was to test a transfusion strategy, not an
intervention, as demonstrated by the fact
that several subjects in each group did
not receive any RBCs because they did
not meet the threshold for transfusion.
When this study was designed, the research subject review board would not
permit decreasing the transfusion threshold limit further for the restrictive group,
but in light of these results, future studies with a lower hemoglobin threshold
should be performed.
Although results more distant from
surgery would add valuable data, the
48-hr postoperative study period was selected as this is when patients are at
greatest risk for low cardiac output states
and when RBCs are most commonly
transfused. Obtaining study measures
further out would require prolonging indwelling catheters for access (limiting
patient mobility and increasing risk of
catheter-related thrombosis) or using
needle-sticks, and the additional blood


values. Furthermore, postoperatively patients typically raise their hemoglobin
concentration over several weeks to
months, especially in the presence of cyanosis. Therefore, hemoglobin differences between groups would lessen over
time until the two groups would not be
significantly different and, thus, not allow
for between-group comparison.
This study would have been stronger
had it been powered to assess BDG and
Fontan subjects separately, as significant
differences in postoperative physiology
exist for each procedure. Children with
variations of single-ventricle physiology
were chosen as they are cyanotic on presentation and have the unique limitation
in their ability to increase their cardiac
output and oxygen delivery. Because subject numbers are limited, all patients
with single-ventricle physiology undergoing cavopulmonary connection were included. Future studies with larger subject
numbers would allow each group to be
analyzed separately. This study would be
of greater interest if it included neonates
with single-ventricle physiology undergoing initial palliation, as these subjects
have a greater degree of cyanosis and
pulmonary vascular reactivity. In light of
our results,we are initiating a prospective
randomized trial comparing transfusion
thresholds in neonates with singleventricle physiology undergoing first
stage surgical palliation.
Had study measures been followed
longer or more subjects studied, additional clinical outcomes measures (e.g.,
sepsis, mediastinitis, thrombosis) would
have been interesting to compare. Testing of cognitive and behavioral development and function at distant time points
could provide documentation of longerterm neurodevelopmental outcomes and
might add important information. Future
studies, including markers of inflammation, could add valuable information regarding each subject’s degree of inflammation and immunomodulation in
response to blood transfusions.

**CONCLUSIONS**

It seems that a lower hemoglobin level
can be maintained in children with single-ventricle physiology post cavopulmonary connection without effecting arterial lactate levels, measurable end points
of tissue oxygenation, and/or clinical outcomes. These results strongly suggest


postoperatively in children with singleventricle physiology post cavopulmonary
connection be reexamined. Achieving
this unproven therapeutic goal comes at
the cost of increased transfusions without
proven benefits. Larger studies utilizing
clinical outcome measures might reflect
improved outcomes in subjects managed
with a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy. These results might be extrapolated
to neonates and other children with complex congenital heart disease who undergo palliative procedures. Further work
is necessary to explore whether our results can be generalized to these populations.
