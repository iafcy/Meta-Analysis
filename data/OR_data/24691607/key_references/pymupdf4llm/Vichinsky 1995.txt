## received an average of 3.8 units, and adults an average of 6.1 units. The average in group 2 was 2.5 units; chil- dren received an average of 1.5 units, and adults 3.3 units. Seventy-two percent of the transfusions in group 1 and 62 percent of those in group 2 involved leuko- cyte-depleted red cells. The distribution of preoperative values for hemoglo- bin S in the two groups overlapped. In group 1, 14 per- cent of the patients had preoperative hemoglobin S lev- els that were more than 1 SD above the mean. In about 40 percent of these patients, the percentage of hemo- globin S did not fall substantially, despite adequate ex- change transfusions or repeated simple transfusions; the other 60 percent had inadequate transfusions be- cause of calculation errors by physicians, difficulty in obtaining matched blood, or complications that pre- cluded further transfusion. In group 2, 15 percent of the patients had preoperative hemoglobin S levels that were less than 1 SD below the mean; 42 percent of these patients required several units of packed red cells to increase their hemoglobin levels to 10 g per deciliter and therefore had significant decreases in the percent- age of hemoglobin S. Most of the other patients in this group received minimal transfusion therapy. The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat prin- ciple, and once the random assignments had been made, the patients remained in their designated groups, regardless of their preoperative hemoglobin S values. However, the relation between hemoglobin S levels and complication rates was also analyzed.

*The group numbers refer to operations.
†Each procedure was classified, according to an established system of
surgical-risk categories, as low risk (e.g., inguinal-hernia repair), intermediate risk (e.g., intraabdominal procedure), or high risk (e.g., intracranial
procedure) [37]


#### Complications

## Nine percent of the procedures in group 1 and 6 per- cent of those in group 2 were associated with minor complications. The most common minor complication was a brief fever. Only serious or life-threatening com- plications were analyzed. Table 3 shows the serious or life-threatening compli- cations that occurred after the start of transfusion ther- apy. Transfusion-associated complications are reported separately. Thirty-one percent of the procedures in group 1 and 35 percent of those in group 2 were associ- ated with at least one complication. Except for compli- cations related to transfusion, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of specific complication rates or overall complication rates accord- ing to the surgical-risk category and type of surgery. There were 74 complications in the preoperative pe- riod after the start of the transfusion regimen Most of

#### Predictors of Complication Rates

## We attempted to identify predictors of the acute chest syndrome, pain, and any other serious or life- threatening complication by selecting 15 variables from demographic data, medical histories, laboratory results, and surgical-risk categories. In a univariate analysis, a history of pulmonary disease and a higher surgical-risk category were associated with a higher incidence of the acute chest syndrome. In a multivariate logistic regres- sion that included these two risk factors, age, and group assignment, only a higher surgical-risk category and a history of pulmonary disease remained signifi- cant independent predictors of the acute chest syn- drome (Table 4). In a univariate analysis, age and in- dicators of clinical severity (organ dysfunction, frequent hospitalization, extensive transfusion, and alloimmuni- zation) were significantly related to the incidence of


## DISCUSSION Many patients with sickle cell anemia require surgery for complications of the disease.[41-48] Despite standard perioperative care, they frequently have serious com- plications.[8,9,25,49] Prophylactic transfusions, which de- crease the frequency of most complications in patients with sickle cell disease,[50] are also frequently given as part of perioperative management. In this study we compared an aggressive preoperative regimen of trans- fusions with a conservative preoperative regimen. We found that the conservative approach was as effective as the aggressive approach in preventing complications and was associated with fewer short-term complica- tions of blood transfusion. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease found that 7 percent of all deaths among patients with sickle cell anemia were related to surgery.[49 ]In this review of over 1000 operations the mortality rate was 1.1 per- cent [49,51] However the lack of randomization and the

## gery, 35 percent of the patients who did not receive transfusions before surgery had pulmonary complications, whereas none of the patients who received transfusions had such com- plications.[86] Since prophylactic transfusion therapy re- duces the incidence of pulmonary disease and other complications of sickle cell anemia, we concluded that a pilot prospective trial of surgery without transfusion must be conducted before attempting a randomized trial.[3,80,81,87-90] In summary, elective surgery in patients with sickle cell anemia is generally safe when performed by a mul- tidisciplinary team. Despite optimal care, however, there is a substantial risk of morbidity, necessitating close cooperation among the medical, anesthesia, and surgical teams. A conservative transfusion regimen is as effective as an aggressive regimen in preventing per- ioperative complications, and a conservative approach reduces the risk of transfusion-associated complica- tions by 50 percent.
