**BACKGROUND: It is important to determine the**
optimal hemoglobin (Hb) concentration for red blood
cell (RBC) transfusion for patients undergoing cardiac
surgery because increased mortality has been associated with the severity of anemia and exposure to RBCs.
Because a definitive trial will require thousands of
patients, and because there is variability in transfusion
practices, a pilot study was undertaken to determine
adherence to proposed strategies.
**STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A single-center par-**
allel randomized controlled pilot trial was conducted in
high-risk cardiac patients to assess adherence to two
transfusion strategies. Fifty patients were randomly
assigned either to a “restrictive” transfusion strategy
(RBCs if their Hb concentration was 70 g/L or less intraoperatively during cardiopulmonary bypass [CPB] and
75 g/L or less postoperatively) or a “liberal” transfusion
strategy (RBCs if their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or
less during CPB and less than 100 g/L postoperatively).
**RESULTS: The percentage of adherence overall was**
84% in the restrictive arm and 41% in the liberal arm.
Twenty-two (88%) patients were transfused 99 units of
RBCs in the liberal group compared to 13 patients
who were transfused 50 units in the restrictive group
(p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in individual adverse outcomes; however, more adverse
events occurred in the restrictive group (38 vs. 15,
p < 0.01).
**CONCLUSION: Adherence to the evaluated interven-**
tions is vital to all randomized controlled trials as it has
the potential to affect outcomes. Further pilot studies
are required to optimize enrollment and transfusion
adherence before a definitive study is conducted.


ed blood cell (RBC) transfusion rates are high in
cardiac surgery, in part due to the question of
whether these patients require a higher transfusion threshold. However, there is little direct evidence to support this assumption. To date no randomizedR
controlled trial has assessed the optimal transfusion
threshold or determined the crossover point at which the
risk of acute anemia exceeds that of RBC transfusion in
cardiac surgical patients.
In a retrospective study of seven Canadian centers,
which included 11,812 cardiac surgical patients,[1] 44% of
patients received one or more RBC units, and the range of
patients transfused was 28% to 60%. In a recent study in

-----

the United States, in 100, 000 patients undergoing primary
elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) the
frequency of RBC transfusion rates ranged from 7.8% to
92.8%.[2] Because morbidity and mortality may be dependent on the severity of anemia and exposure to
transfusions,[3-8] it is essential to determine the optimal
threshold hemoglobin (Hb) concentration at which physicians should be transfusing these patients, to reduce
morbidity and mortality. This is particularly important
because the efficacy of liberal transfusion has not been
established in cardiac surgical patients and RBC transfusion has been associated with an increased risk of renal
failure (odds ratio [OR], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.9-2.3), cardiac complications (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.5-1.6),
neurologic events (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.4), and mortality
(OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.7-1.9).[8]

Despite the large number of published clinical studies
which have attempted to determine the optimal Hb concentration at which to transfuse cardiac surgical patients,
no clear consensus has emerged to guide clinical practice.
Retrospective analyses have demonstrated increased
morbidity and mortality near preoperative Hb values less
than 120 g/L[5,9] and at intraoperative Hb values ranging
from 50 to 80 g/L.[10,11] Furthermore, patients having cardiovascular surgery with postoperative hematocrit (Hct)
values of 34% (Hb concentrations of 110 g/L) or higher
appeared to have an increase in morbidity.[12] The OR for
myocardial infarction for the group with a Hct of 34% or
higher was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.04-4.76) compared to the group
with a Hct of 24% or less.[12] Yet, low Hb concentrations
have also been associated with adverse outcomes. Of
27 patients undergoing infrainguinal arterial bypass surgery,[13] six patients who had symptomatic cardiac events
had a Hct level below 28% (a Hb concentration of approximately 93 g/L).
Because there is a wide range of Hb concentrations
for transfusion, and because anemia and transfusions are
independently associated with morbidity and mortality,
a definitive study is needed to determine the effect of
anemia. However, barriers to recruitment and adherence
need to be identified so they can be addressed before a
larger definitive study.[14] Clinical uncertainty resulting
from 1) apprehension about transfusion, 2) concern that
the transfusion thresholds are not consistent with clinical
practice, 3) not knowing which treatment is best, and 4)
the concern that the doctor–patient relationship could be
adversely affected by trial participation have been shown
to be deterrents in previous randomized controlled trials.[15,16] Therefore, a pilot study is required to determine the
acceptability and feasibility of the transfusion strategies
by physicians and patients because it is anticipated that
enrollment and adherence will be low. The objective of
this study was to determine enrollment and adherence
with a protocol for Hb transfusion strategies in patients
having cardiac surgery.


#### MATERIALS AND METHODS

**Study design**

A single-center open-labeled parallel randomized controlled pilot trial of two transfusion strategies in patients
having elective cardiac surgery was conducted to determine enrollment and adherence to Hb concentrations
used for transfusion triggers. The randomization
sequence was created using permuted blocks of four
stratified by age and the Cardiac Anesthesia Risk Score
(CARE) score.[17] Opaque sequential sealed envelopes were
used and opened at the start of surgery. The allocation
sequence was generated by an independent statistician
at the Ottawa Methods Centre of the Ottawa Hospital
Research Institute. The research coordinator enrolled
participants and assigned participants to the transfusion strategies. The study was approved by the research
ethics board at St Michael’s Hospital and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before
randomization.
Eligible participants were identified in the preoperative clinic or hospital ward at St Michael’s Hospital
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) from 2007 to 2010. St Michael’s Hospital is a university-affiliated tertiary care center
with approximately 1000 cardiac surgeries conducted
yearly.
Patients were allocated to one of two transfusion
strategies. Patients allocated to a “restrictive” transfusion
strategy received RBC transfusions if their Hb was 70 g/L
or less during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and 75 g/L
or less postoperatively after bypass. Patients allocated to a
“liberal” transfusion strategy received RBC transfusions if
their Hb concentration was 95 g/L or less during and less
than 100 g/L after bypass. A lower Hb concentration for
transfusion was used during CPB because metabolic
demands are reduced during anesthesia and CPB. When a
threshold was reached, each group was to receive 1 unit of
RBCs administered at a time followed by determination of
the Hb concentration. The transfusion protocols were to
be adhered to from beginning of surgery until discharge
from hospital. Patients who had rapid blood loss were
transfused at the discretion of the attending physician. All
other aspects of patient care were left to the discretion of
the attending physicians.
All outcomes were prespecified. The primary objective was to assess the enrollment rate and overall adherence to the transfusion strategies. We defined successful
adherence as adherence to the transfusion strategies in
90% of patients in more than 90% of their days in hospital.
Adherence was defined as transfusion of RBCs according
to the Hb threshold.
Secondary outcomes included RBC transfusions,
clinical outcomes, and physiologic indicators of hypoxemia (mixed venous oxygen saturation). Clinical outcomes were defined as 1) in-hospital all-cause mortality;


-----

2) a composite score of morbidity consisting of a) neurologic events defined as a new focal neurologic deficit
lasting more than 24 hours or irreversible encephalopathy,
b) dialysis-dependent renal failure or greater than 50%
increase in creatinine, c) prolonged low cardiac output
state (i.e., need for two or more inotropes for 24 hours or
more, intraaortic balloon pump or ventricular assist
device for greater than 48 h), and/or myocardial infarction, defined as troponin I level greater than 2.5 mg/L and
new Q waves on electrocardiogram or a clinical diagnosis;
and 3) hospital lengths of stay. We assembled an independent data safety monitoring board consisting of a cardiac
anesthesiologist and a hematologist who reviewed the
data after 20 patients were recruited.

**Study population**

Eligible participants were adults patients undergoing
cardiac surgery with a CARE score (a score for cardiac
surgery patients used to predict morbidity and mortality)
of 3 or 4,[17] or patients of advanced age defined as greater
than or equal to 80 years on the day of screening were
included. A CARE score of 3 is defined as patients with
uncontrolled medical problems such as unstable angina
treated with intravenous heparin or nitroglycerin, use of a
preoperative intraaortic balloon pump, heart failure with
pulmonary or peripheral edema, uncontrolled hypertension, renal insufficiency (creatinine level greater than
140 mmol/L), debilitating systemic diseases, or patients in
whom a complex surgery is undertaken (i.e., reoperation,
combined valve and coronary artery surgery, multiple
valve surgery, left ventricular aneurysmectomy, repair of
ventricular septal defect after myocardial infarction, or
CABG of diffuse or heavily calcified vessels). A CARE score
of 4 is defined as patients with any uncontrolled medical
problem and in whom a complex surgery is undertaken.[17]

These patients were selected as transfusion rates in these
individuals are high (e.g., reoperation, combined valve
and coronary artery surgery,[18-20] renal insufficiency[18,21,22]).
Patients were excluded if they refused participation, were
unable to receive or refused blood products, or were
involved in the autologous predonation program.

**Anesthesia and surgical management**

All patients remained on their preoperative medications
as directed until the surgical date. Patients were anesthetized using a narcotic (1-2 mg/kg sufentanil or 10-20 mg/kg
fentanyl), a benzodiazepine (0.1-0.15 mg/kg midazolam),
0.2% to 1.5% isoflurane, and/or 50-100 mg/kg/min propofol, with muscle relaxation provided from 0.6 to 1.0 mg/kg
rocuronium or 0.15 mg/kg pancuronium. Heparin was
given to maintain an activated clotting time of more than
420 seconds during CPB. Bypass management included
nonpulsatile pump flow of 2.4 ¥ body surface area, mean


arterial pressure 55 to 85 mmHg, temperature 33 to 35°C,
and blood sugar 4 to 10 mmol/L. Myocardial protection
was achieved with cold blood crystalloid cardioplegia, and
a “hot-shot” (250 to 500 mL) was delivered just before the
removal of the aortic cross-clamp. After separation from
CPB, heparin was reversed with protamine (approx.
10 mg/1000 units of heparin) to normalize the activated
clotting time. Postoperatively, patients were managed in a
specialized cardiovascular intensive care unit with standardized protocols for early extubation (2-4 hr). Intraoperative use of antifibrinolytic agents and cell salvage are
routinely used at the study site and were used at the discretion of the surgical team.

**Statistical analysis**

Continuous variables were described as mean (standard
deviation [SD]) or medians (with interquartile range [IQR])
if the data were not normally distributed. Categorical variablesweredescribedasnumbersandpercentages.Weanalyzed adherence rates and also examined the effect of the
transfusion strategies on the clinical outcomes using
univariate analysis, t test, and Mann-Whitney U test for
continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical
variables (or the Fisher’s exact test if the expected number
in any cell was less than 5).The significance level was set at
a p value of less than 0.05 for all statistical analyses. All
analyses were conducted on an intent-to-treat basis.
A total sample size of 50 patients was estimated to
produce a 97.5% CI equal to the sample adherence prevalence plus or minus 8% when the true prevalence of
adherence was hypothesized to be 90%. Therefore, 25
patients were randomized to the restrictive group and 25
patients were randomized to the liberal group. We estimated our sample size using computer software (PASS
2002, NCSS, Kaysville, UT).

#### RESULTS

A flow diagram for the 50 patients recruited in this study
demonstrated that a high percentage of individuals were
not eligible and a considerable proportion declined participation in the study (Fig. 1). Enrollment rate was less
than 1%.
The characteristics of the patients according to allocation group are listed in Table 1. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to age,
height, weight, and comorbid illnesses. Intraoperatively,
the duration of CPB and cross-clamping were similar for
both groups as were the volume of estimated intraoperative blood loss and the number of attempts to separate
from CPB. Seventy-two percent of patients in the restrictive group and 68% of patients in the liberal group were
using antiplatelet (PLT) medications before surgery. AntiPLT medications tended to be discontinued earlier in the

The rationale for nonadherence was not well described for
the remainder of the transfusions.
The mean Hb concentrations were similar preoperatively but after surgery the Hb concentrations began to
diverge (Fig. 2). The differences in Hb concentration
increased as the hospital stay increased (p < 0.01). The
mean Hb concentration on Day 6 for the restrictive group
was 91.1 g/L and for the liberal group 107.0 g/L
(p = 0.0004).
The mixed venous oxygen saturation was measured
in some patients (11 patients in the liberal group and four
patients in the restrictive group) with a pulmonary artery
catheter as a sign of tissue hypoxia (Fig. 4). There were no
differences in the mixed venous oxygen saturation before
or after RBC transfusion in the restrictive or liberal group.
We did not detect significant differences in any of the
adverse outcomes (Table 4); however, the total number of
adverse events was 38 (including death) in the restrictive
strategy group compared to 15 in the liberal strategy (OR,
6.4; 95% CI, 2.8-14.9). There were four deaths in the
restrictive group and one in the liberal group. In the
restrictive strategy, one patient died of respiratory failure


secondary to pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary edema; two patients died from septic shock; and
one patient had a cerebrovascular accident. The cause of
death of the patient in the liberal group was cardiogenic

izability of results.[25] Only a minority of patients are
included in randomized controlled trials—28% of patients
assessed in TRACS were included in that study.[26]

For both strategies there was a lower than accepted
adherence rate. The low proportion of adherence on the


ward in the liberal group could confound a study of transfusion. The lack of adherence likely reflects the preference
for a restrictive transfusion strategy at our hospital and
patient preference due to educational information administered to them about the risks of transfusion during hospitalization. These adherence rates are lower than we had
anticipated and reflects the challenges of conducting
studies in transfusion medicine in this patient population
that need to be surmounted. For example, as a result of this
study we will revise our consent form to highlight the
potential risk of not receiving a transfusion and the uncertainty for the need of transfusion. In addition, the lack of
adherence also reflects how adherence is defined and
calculated.
Although not our primary outcome, patients allocated to a lower Hb concentration experienced more
adverse events. This occurred despite a lack of significant
difference in the mixed venous oxygen saturation. It has
been well established that reduction in mixed venous
oxygen saturation is a poor surrogate of focal tissue
hypoxia as focal reductions in vital organs have been demonstrated in the absence of changes in venous saturation.[27] In addition, the pilot study was not powered to
detect a difference in the mixed venous oxygen saturation.
Nonetheless, the higher frequency of adverse events
potentially related to tissue oxygen delivery suggests that
further research is needed to determine if patients with
high-risk features may benefit from higher Hb concentrations for transfusion.
Although the TRACS study did not find a significant
difference in mortality between a Hb concentration of
80 g/L compared to 100 g/L, the trial was not powered to
do so. Because mortality rates in cardiac surgery are low,
thousands of patients would need to be recruited for mortality as a primary outcome.[25] TRACS did find a trend to an
increased risk of cardiogenic shock in patients randomized to a Hb concentration of 80 g/L. There was also a
suggestion that mortality may be increased in the restrictive group because the hazard ratio for mortality, although
not significant, was 1.28 (95% CI, 0.60-2.73); and the mortality rate from Day 18 to Day 28 was approximately 3% for
the liberal strategy but 5% for the restrictive strategy,
which would be a clinically important difference.[25]

There are a few limitations to this study. The enrollment rate was low; however, considering that patients are
sensitized to the risk of transfusion before surgery and
there were several competing studies, these results are not
unexpected. Future studies need to stress the importance
of determining the transfusion thresholds and the lack of
scientific evidence to support institutional transfusion
thresholds in this population. The adherence rates on the
ward were lower than anticipated, likely due to the perception that most adverse events secondary to hypoxia would
be anticipated to occur in the operating room or in the
intensive care unit. This study was a pilot study and the
