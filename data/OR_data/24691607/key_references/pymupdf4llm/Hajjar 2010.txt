**Context Perioperative red blood cell transfusion is commonly used to address ane-**
mia, an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality after cardiac operations;
however, evidence regarding optimal blood transfusion practice in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is lacking.

**Objective To define whether a restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion**
strategy is as safe as a liberal strategy in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.

**Design, Setting, and Patients The Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Sur-**
gery (TRACS) study, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical noninferiority trial
conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in an intensive care unit at a
university hospital cardiac surgery referral center in Brazil. Consecutive adult patients
(n=502) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were eligible;
analysis was by intention-to-treat.

**Intervention Patients were randomly assigned to a liberal strategy of blood trans-**
fusion (to maintain a hematocrit �30%) or to a restrictive strategy (hematocrit �24%).

**Main Outcome Measure Composite end point of 30-day all-cause mortality and**
severe morbidity (cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal injury requiring dialysis or hemofiltration) occurring during the hospital stay. The
noninferiority margin was predefined at −8% (ie, 8% minimal clinically important increase in occurrence of the composite end point).

**Results Hemoglobinconcentrationsweremaintainedatameanof10.5g/dL(95%con-**
fidence interval [CI], 10.4-10.6) in the liberal-strategy group and 9.1 g/dL (95% CI, 9.09.2) in the restrictive-strategy group (P�.001). A total of 198 of 253 patients (78%) in
the liberal-strategy group and 118 of 249 (47%) in the restrictive-strategy group received
a blood transfusion (P�.001). Occurrence of the primary end point was similar between
groups (10% liberal vs 11% restrictive; between-group difference, 1% [95% CI, −6% to
4%]; P=.85). Independent of transfusion strategy, the number of transfused red blood
cellunitswasanindependentriskfactorforclinicalcomplicationsordeathat30days(hazard ratio for each additional unit transfused, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]; P=.002).

**Conclusion Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of a restrictive peri-**
operative transfusion strategy compared with a more liberal strategy resulted in noninferior rates of the combined outcome of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity.

room and twice daily in the ICU for
each patient. Attending physicians
could administer RBC transfusions outside the rules of the protocol if they considered the patient’s status to be lifethreatening, as in hemorrhagic or other
forms of circulatory shock; such an
event was considered a protocol deviation. Patients were analyzed in their
originally assigned groups on an intention-to-treat basis.

was induced with fentanyl (3-5 µg/kg),
midazolam(0.05mg/kg),etomidate(0.20.3 mg/kg), and pancuronium bromide
(0.1 mg/kg). Anesthesia was maintainedwithisofluraneinoxygenandfentanyl as needed. During cardiopulmonary bypass, additional doses of
midazolam and pancuronium were administered as required. All patients were
monitored with an arterial and central
venous catheter; some also received a
pulmonary artery catheter. After trachealintubation,allpatientsreceivedinvasive mechanical ventilation with intermittent positive pressure with a tidal

all patients before enrollment.
Patients were randomly assigned to a
liberal or a restrictive transfusion strategy. Opaque envelopes arranged using
a random-number table were prepared
by the chief statistician and opened sequentially to determine the patient’s
treatment group. The research coordinator enrolled the participants and obtained informed consent. Information
about the treatment strategy was given

patients in the cardiac ICU. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were measured every 12 hours until ICU discharge. Levels of serum creatinine, creatine kinase
MB, troponin, electrolytes, lactate,
blood gases, and bilirubin were measured once daily. Clinical and laboratory data for the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II[17] and for the Acute
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score[18] were recorded using the
worst value within the first 24 hours after ICU admission. Data were also recorded regarding hemodynamic status, need for vasoactive drugs and other
medications, need for mechanical ventilation, need for dialysis, and other
forms of organ dysfunction. During the
hospital stay, data were collected regarding the use of RBC transfusion, hematocrit goals, and complications. After discharge from the ICU, clinical
outcomes were evaluated on the regular ward, still in a blinded fashion.
Respiratory complications were defined as prolonged need for mechanical ventilation (�48 hours) and development of pneumonia or acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
defined by standard criteria.[19] Pneumonia was diagnosed if the patient had
a new, persistent, or progressive lung
infiltrate on chest radiograph and if at
least 2 of the following criteria were
present: temperature 38°C or greater,
leukocytosis greater than 12 000
cells/µL or leukopenia less than 3000
cells/µL, or purulent endotracheal secretions with a Gram stain showing
more than 25 neutrophils and fewer
than 10 epithelial cells per field.[20] In patients receiving mechanical ventilation and with clinical suspicion of nosocomialpneumonia,bronchialsecretions
for cultures were obtained with a protected pulmonary specimen brush introduced by fiberoptic bronchoscopy
through the endotracheal tube.
Cardiac complications included cardiogenic shock, tachyarrhythmia, or
perioperative cardiac ischemia. Cardiogenic shock was defined as the presence of tachycardia, hypotension, and
poor perfusion associated with SCVO2
less than 65% or metabolic acidosis (de

ime (750 mg) were administered intravenously at induction of anesthesia. All
surgical procedures were undertaken
through a median sternotomy.
In all patients, clopidogrel and oral
anticoagulants were stopped at least 5
days before surgery. All patients received 5 g of ε-aminocaproic acid, an
antifibrinolytic, at induction of anesthesia and an additional 1 g/h until the
end of surgery. Anticoagulation was established with an initial dose of 500
IU/kg of heparin injected into the central venous line before initiation of bypass, with a target activated clotting
time of 480 seconds. Additional heparin was given intermittently to titrate
clotting times during bypass. At the end
of bypass, heparin was reversed by protamine chloride in a 1:1 ratio, with additional protamine given as required
to return the activated clotting time to
preoperative values. A coagulation profile and platelet count were obtained
after heparin reversal. Significant intraoperative bleeding associated with
platelet disorders or coagulopathy could
be treated using platelets, fresh frozen
plasma, or cryoprecipitate. Surgeons
performed a hemostasis review. Cell salvage was not used.
A centrifugal pump (Medtronic Biomedicus; Medtronic, Minneapolis,
Minnesota) was used for bypass. An extracorporeal circuit containing a microporous polypropylene membrane oxygenator(Braile;Sa˜oJose´ doRioPreto,Sa˜o
Paulo, Brazil) with an integrated venouscardiotomyreservoirwasused.The
oxygenator was primed with 1500 mL
of lactated Ringer solution, 20% (1 g/kg)
mannitol, and 2500 units of unfractionated heparin. During bypass, a mild hypothermic temperature management
strategy(32°Cto34°C)with �-statblood
gas management was used in all patients. During bypass, nonpulsatile flow
was maintained at 2.0 to 2.4 L/min per
square meter, and mean arterial pressure varied from 60 to 90 mm Hg. Myocardial preservation was achieved by intermittent antegrade cold crystalloid
cardioplegia. Cardioplegia was repeated every 30 minutes during the
cross-clamping period. Fluid manage

ment was accomplished with lactated
Ringer solution and adjusted according
to filling pressures, diuresis, and cardiac output. Albumin or hydroxyethyl
starch (130/0.4) could be administered
if considered necessary.
Patients were transferred to the ICU
before recovery from anesthesia while
still receiving mechanical ventilation.
Patients were weaned from the ventilator after exhibiting complete recovery from anesthesia, hemodynamic stability with no evidence of significant
bleeding, core temperature higher than
36°C, and adequate blood gas values.
Patients were discharged from the ICU
on the second postoperative day if they
met institutional discharge criteria.

**Baseline Assessment**
**and Data Collection**
At the time of randomization, demographic and clinical data as well as the
information needed to calculate the predicted risk of surgery using the standard EuroSCORE (European System for
Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation)[16]
were obtained for each patient. Preoperative laboratory values, collected up to
48 hours before surgery, were recorded
and included hemoglobin, hematocrit,
prothrombin time, activated partial
thromboplastintime,creatininelevel,bilirubin level, and platelet counts.
During surgery, hemoglobin levels
and hematocrit were measured at baseline (just after induction of anesthesia), during bypass, and at the end of
the procedure. Central venous oxygen saturation (SCVO2) and lactate concentration were measured at the beginning and end of the procedure.
Information was also collected on the
type of surgical procedure, number and
type of grafts used, duration of bypass, duration of cross-clamping, number of RBC units transfused, administration of other blood products, amount
and type of fluids administered, and
clinically important events such as
bleeding or hemodynamic instability.
During the ICU stay, clinical data
were collected daily by 2 blinded assessors, both trained physicians with
more than 3 years’ experience caring for

crease in base deficit �4) or an increase in lactate level (�18.02 mg/dL

[to convert to mmol/L, multiply by
0.111]) in the absence of a cause other
than heart failure.[21] An electrocardiogram was performed twice daily during the ICU stay and once daily on the
regular ward. Perioperative cardiac ischemia was considered if creatine kinase MB level was elevated to at least
5 times the upper limit of normal (�30
ng/mL),iftroponinIvaluesweregreater
than 5 ng/mL during the first 72 hours,
if new pathological Q waves appeared,
if coronary artery occlusion was angiographically documented, or if there was
imaging evidence of new loss of viable
myocardium.[22]
Renal function was evaluated daily
using the RIFLE (renal risk, injury, failure, loss, end-stage kidney disease) classification.[23] The need for renal replacement therapy was recorded.
Neurologic complications were diagnosed if the patient presented with delirium (the Confusion Assessment
Method in the ICU scale[24] was applied
daily) or stroke, which was characterized by a new focal deficit with a compatibleimageoncomputedtomography.
Infectiouscomplicationsincludedseptic shock, defined by standard criteria[25]; mediastinitis, defined as a superficial or deep infection of the sternotomy
wound with positive findings on cultures obtained from the wound; and
pneumonia as described above. Inflammatory complications were diagnosed if
the patient had vasodilatory shock, associatedwithacardiacindexgreaterthan
4.0L/minpersquaremeter.Bleedingwas
defined as clinically important when
blood loss exceeded 100 to 300 mL/h after ICU admission and patients needed
reoperation.[26] Operative mortality was
consideredasdeathfromallcausesinthe
30 days after surgery. Telephone contact was used to evaluate this outcome.

**Outcome Measures**
The primary outcome was a composite end point that included 30-day all
cause mortality and severe morbidity
(cardiogenic shock, ARDS, or acute renal injury requiring dialysis or hemo

filtration) occurring during the hospital stay. These clinical complications
were selected because of the established association between these complications and blood transfusion and
their known association with mortality.[5,9,12,13] Secondary outcomes included all respiratory, cardiac, neurologic, and infectious complications;
inflammatory complications; bleeding requiring reoperation; and ICU and
hospital lengths of stay. We also evaluated the incidence of RBC transfusions and the number of units transfused, predictive factors for RBC
transfusions, and the effects of transfusion on patient outcomes.

**Statistical Analysis**
This was a noninferiority trial, and we
estimated a 10% incidence of the primary outcome.[12,13] Based on previous
studies,[12,13] we predicted there would
be no difference between groups for the
primary outcome event rate and set the
noninferiority margin at −8% (minimal clinically important difference of
8%). To obtain 90% statistical power
with a 1-sided � =.05, at least 482 patients needed to be enrolled. Considering the probability of subject attrition, we added 6% to the sample size,
yielding a final required number of 512
patients. An interim analysis was conducted by the monitoring committee after 250 patients had been enrolled, and
the monitoring board advised that the
trial should be continued.
We compared baseline characteristics, follow-up measures, and clinical
outcomes on an intention-to-treat basis according to the randomized study
group assignment. Continuous variables were compared using a t test or
Mann-Whitney U test and categorical
variables using Pearson �[2] or Fisher exact or likelihood ratio test. Logarithmic transformation was performed to
normalize the distribution of variables so parametric tests could be used.
Comparisons of hemoglobin concentration over time were made using
analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed by the least-squares difference test to discriminate differences.


Results are expressed as means with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) or medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs).
A multiple logistic regression analysis
was performed to estimate predictive
factors for primary and secondary outcomes and predictive factors for red
blood cell transfusion, including variablessignificantintheunivariatemodel,
ie, age, sex, body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared), comorbid
conditions, left ventricular ejection fraction and EuroSCORE, type of surgery,
duration of cardiopulmonary bypass,
initial and final hemoglobin level, hematocrit, lactate concentration, SCVO2,
and number of RBC units transfused.
We calculated unadjusted 30-day
Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, dividing patients by transfusion strategy and
by number of transfused RBC units,
using a log-rank test. To determine the
risk of death at 30 days according to the
number of transfused RBC units, we
built a multivariate Cox proportional
hazard model in the overall population with death as the dependent factor, using the variables above.
A 1-sided P value less than .05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
Illinois).

**RESULTS**

**Study Population**
A total of 1765 patients were assessed
for eligibility (FIGURE 1). After exclusions for various medical reasons and
lack of consent, 512 patients were enrolled in the study: 257 assigned to the
liberal transfusion strategy group and
255 to the restrictive transfusion strategy group. Of these, 10 patients (1.9%)
(4 in the liberal-strategy group and 6
in the restrictive-strategy group) were
excluded after consent because surgery was performed without cardiopulmonary bypass, leaving 502 (253 in the
liberal-strategy group and 249 in the restrictive-strategy group) in the intention-to-treat analysis. In the liberalstrategy group, there were no cases of
protocol deviation. Four of the pa

tients in the restrictive-strategy group
were considered to have deviated from
protocol because they received 1 RBC
unit outside the protocol trigger to address hemodynamic instability.
Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the study groups
(TABLE). Hemoglobin concentrations at
the time of randomization were similar in the liberal- and restrictivestrategy groups (mean, 13.1 g/dL [SD,
1.6] vs 13.4 g/dL [SD, 1.8], P=.18). Procedure-related variables in the intraoperative period were similar between
groups, with the exception of RBC
transfusion (eTable 1, available at http://
www.jama.com).

**Intervention**
Hemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher in the liberalstrategy group than in the restrictivestrategy group intraoperatively (final
hemoglobin level), immediately postoperatively, and at days 1, 2, 3, and 7
after ICU admission (FIGURE 2). The
mean hemoglobin concentrations were
10.5 g/dL (95% CI, 10.4-10.6) in the liberal-strategy group and 9.1 g/dL (95%
CI, 9.0-9.2) in the restrictive-strategy
group (P �.001). Hematocrit concentrations were maintained above or at the
threshold for 95% of the time; overall
average hematocrit values in the ICU
were 31.8% (95% CI, 31.5%-32.1%) in
the liberal-strategy group and 28.4%
(95% CI, 27.9%-28.9%) in the restrictive-strategy group (P � .001).
As expected, more patients in the liberal-strategy group received a blood
transfusion than in the restrictivestrategy group (78% vs 47%, P�.001).
ThetotalnumberoftransfusedRBCunits
was613intheliberal-strategygroupand
258 in the restrictive-strategy group
(P�.001).Mosttransfusionsweregiven
in the operating room or in the first 3
days after surgery. The liberal-strategy
group received a median of 2 RBC units
(IQR, 1-3), while the restrictivestrategy group received a median of 0
RBC units (IQR, 0-2) (P�.001) (eFigure 1). There was no difference in the
median storage age of RBC units between the liberal- vs restrictive-strategy

stay, there were no differences between
the groups in the use of fresh frozen

**Outcome Measures**
The primary composite end point—
all-cause 30-day mortality, cardiogenic shock, ARDS, or acute renal injury requiring dialysis or hemofiltration
during the hospital stay—occurred in
10% (95% CI, 6%-13%) of patients in
the liberal-strategy group and in 11%
(95% CI, 7%-15%) in the restrictivestrategy group (between-group difference, 1% [95% CI, −6% to 4%]; P=.85)


(eFigure 2). The lower limit of the between-group difference CI is above the
−8% predefined noninferiority threshold, confirming the primary hypothesis of noninferiority between the
groups. There was no significant difference between the strategies in 30day mortality rates (5% [95% CI,
2%-7%] vs 6% [95% CI, 3%-9%], respectively; P =.93) (FIGURE 3) or rates
of cardiogenic shock (5% [95% CI,

Transfusion of 5 or more RBC units
was associated with higher mortality
(FIGURE 4). In a multivariate Cox regression analysis that included age and
sex, type of surgery, left ventricular ejection fraction, previous cardiac surgery, initial and final operative hemoglobin level and hematocrit, lactate
level, and SCVO2, the number of transfused RBC units was independently associated with an increased risk of death
at 30 days in the entire population (hazardratio,1.2[95%CI,1.1-1.4]; P=.002)
(eTable 6).

**COMMENT**
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trial to compare a liberal with a restrictive transfusion strategy in patients
undergoing cardiac surgery. Our data
suggestthatarestrictivetransfusionstrategy targeting a hematocrit of 24% is as
safe as a liberal strategy targeting a hematocrit of 30%, with respect to a composite end point of 30-day mortality and
inpatient clinical complications. Moreover, regardless of the treatment strategy, the number of transfused RBC units
was an independent riskfactorforworse
outcomes, including mortality.
Patients in this study experienced
slightly higher rates of serious complications than those in other studies,[27,28] likely because our population
was a higher-risk group, with a median EuroScore of 4 to 5 and with some
patients undergoing valve surgery alone
or combined with CABG surgery. In addition, our hospital is a referral center
for cardiac surgery, and some patients
were severely ill. Although there were
no significant differences in the mor

tality rates and rates of inpatient complications between our 2 groups, there
was a trend toward an increased incidence of cardiogenic shock in patients
treated using the restrictive compared
with the liberal strategy.
In a randomized controlled clinical
trial of 838 critically ill patients (not including patients undergoing cardiac
surgery), He´bert et al showed that a restrictive strategy of red blood cell transfusion was as effective as and possibly
superior to a liberal transfusion strategy.[13] However,incardiacsurgery,there
have been no similar large randomized controlled trials. Two small studies in patients undergoing CABG surgery suggested that different transfusion
strategies gave similar outcomes[29,30];
however, the small numbers of patients in those studies did not allow for
definitive conclusions to be drawn.
Guidelines from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists emphasize
the lack of evidence on transfusion triggers after cardiac surgery.[31]
The rationale for implementing a restrictive transfusion strategy is based on
many studies that have shown a lack of
benefitand,atthesametime,substantially

TRANSFUSION REQUIREMENTS AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY


fusion strategy, transfusing even a single
RBC unit was associated with a significantly increased risk of serious postoperative morbidity and mortality. RBC
transfusion was independently associated with a 1.2-fold increased risk of
death at 30 days for each unit transfused. These findings suggest that the
primary strategy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery should be to avoid
giving RBC transfusion solely to correct low hemoglobin levels. The increased risk of mortality related to the
number of transfused RBC units supports a restrictive therapy in cardiac surgery. In addition, clinicians caring for
patients after cardiac surgery should administer only 1 RBC unit at a time, because this may result in less exposure
to risks but similar benefits.
Limitations of our study include that
it was performed in a single referral center for cardiac surgery, which could
compromise the generalizability of our
findings. Another limitation is the lack
of blood leukodepletion in our study,
which reflects current practice in Brazil but again could limit generalizability. Some studies,[46,47] but not all,[48] have
suggested better outcomes in critically ill patients who receive transfusions of leukodepleted RBCs. The potential higher risk associated with use
of nonleukodepleted blood in our study
may be compensated for by the relatively young age of the RBCs, with a median of only 3 days of storage in both
groups, the result of routine active selection of fresh blood (stored less than
10 days) for patients undergoing cardiac surgery at our institution. In one
study, transfusions with blood stored
for more than 14 days were associated
with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.[49]
In conclusion, using a noninferiority margin of −8% among patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, the
use of a restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy compared with a more
liberal strategy resulted in noninferior
rates of the combined outcome of 30day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity.

studies has pointed to worse early, midterm,andlong-termoutcomesrelatedto
transfusion in patients undergoing cardiacsurgery.[36,37] Inaretrospectiveanalysisof11963patientswhounderwentisolated CABG surgery, Koch et al showed
that perioperative RBC transfusion was
associated with a dose-dependent increasedriskofpostoperativecardiaccomplications,seriousinfection,renalfailure,
neurologiccomplications,overallmorbidity,prolongedventilatorsupport,andinhospitalmortality.[38]Inasimilarretrospectivestudy,Murphyetal[39]showedthatRBC
transfusionwasstronglyassociatedwith
infectionandwithpostoperativeischemic
morbidity,hospitalstay,increasedearly
and late mortality, and hospital costs.
However, there has been concern
about the adverse effects of anemia in
patients with cardiovascular disease.[4,5] One retrospective cohort study
of 1958 surgical patients reported that
increased severity of anemia was associated with a disproportionate increase in mortality rates among patients with cardiovascular disease.[4]
Moreover, some studies in patients with


anemia and myocardial infarction seem
to suggest that transfusion may be beneficial (OR for mortality, 0.42 [95% CI,
0.20-0.89]),[40] particularly for patients
older than 65 years (OR for mortality,
0.69 [95% CI, 0.53-0.89]; hematocrit
range, 30-33).[41] In our study, patients
with cardiovascular disease did not have
adverse outcomes when a hematocrit
threshold of 24% was used. This apparent discrepancy may be the result of
confounding or because the hemoglobin concentrations of our patients during the study were not less than 9 g/dL.
Sixty-three percent of our study
population received an RBC transfusion. A similar rate was reported in a
retrospective study of 8724 patients presenting a lower number of risk factors
for transfusion, such as older age, heart
failure, on-pump surgery, and valve
procedures.[40] Reoperation, female sex,
high final lactate level in the operating
room, long bypass duration, and low
baseline hemoglobin level were independently associated with transfusion. These observations are similar to
those reported in previous retrospective studies.[42-44]
As expected, the restrictive-strategy
patients received fewer RBC units than
the liberal-strategy patients and, consequently, had lower mean hemoglobin levels during the study. Interestingly, this did not result in a higher
incidence of clinical complications. Presumably this occurred because the restrictive strategy did not result in reduced oxygen availability to the cells.
This is supported by the lack of difference in lactate levels between the 2
groups during the study period.
In our study, independent of the
treatment strategy, patients who received an RBC transfusion had higher
rates of complications after surgery, including 30-day mortality. The number of transfused RBC units was a predictive factor for 30-day mortality. As
already suggested by Koch et al[38] for
adult cardiac procedures and by Gauvin
et al[45] for pediatric cardiac operations,
we showed that the higher the number of transfused RBC units, the higher
the mortality. Regardless of the trans
