##### ABSTRACT

**_Background_** To determine whether a restrictive
strategy of red-cell transfusion and a liberal strategy
produced equivalent results in critically ill patients,
we compared the rates of death from all causes at 30
days and the severity of organ dysfunction.

**_Methods_** We enrolled 838 critically ill patients with
euvolemia after initial treatment who had hemoglobin
concentrations of less than 9.0 g per deciliter within
72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit
and randomly assigned 418 patients to a restrictive
strategy of transfusion, in which red cells were transfused if the hemoglobin concentration dropped below
7.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations
were maintained at 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter, and 420
patients to a liberal strategy, in which transfusions
were given when the hemoglobin concentration fell
below 10.0 g per deciliter and hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter.

**_Results_** Overall, 30-day mortality was similar in
the two groups (18.7 percent vs. 23.3 percent, P=
0.11). However, the rates were significantly lower
with the restrictive transfusion strategy among patients who were less acutely ill — those with an
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II
score of «20 (8.7 percent in the restrictive-strategy
group and 16.1 percent in the liberal-strategy group,
P=0.03) — and among patients who were less than
55 years of age (5.7 percent and 13.0 percent, respectively; P=0.02), but not among patients with clinically significant cardiac disease (20.5 percent and 22.9
percent, respectively; P=0.69). The mortality rate
during hospitalization was significantly lower in the
restrictive-strategy group (22.2 percent vs. 28.1 percent, P=0.05).

**_Conclusions_** A restrictive strategy of red-cell
transfusion is at least as effective as and possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy in critically ill
patients, with the possible exception of patients with
acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.

ED-cell transfusions are a cornerstone of
critical care practice,[1] but there are divergent views on the risks of anemia and the
benefits of transfusion in this setting. One

# Rimportant concern is that anemia may not be well

tolerated by critically ill patients.[2,3] Indeed, two recent studies suggested that anemia increases the risk
of death after surgery in patients with cardiac disease[2]
and in critically ill patients.[3] Red-cell transfusions are
used to augment the delivery of oxygen in the hope
of avoiding the deleterious effects of oxygen debt.[4]
This view prompted the routine use of transfusion
in patients with hemoglobin concentrations that were
often more than 10.0 g per deciliter in studies evaluating resuscitation protocols.[5,6]
Critically ill patients may, however, be at increased
risk for the immunosuppressive[7,8] and microcirculatory[9,10] complications of red-cell transfusions. In addition, concern about the supply and safety of blood
has also encouraged a conservative approach to transfusions. For these reasons, the optimal transfusion
practice for various types of critically ill patients with
anemia has not been established.
To elucidate the potential risks of anemia and possible benefits of transfusions in critically ill patients,
we conducted a randomized, controlled, clinical trial
to determine whether a restrictive approach to redcell transfusion that maintains hemoglobin concentrations between 7.0 and 9.0 g per deciliter is equiv

alent to a more liberal strategy of maintaining hemoglobin concentrations between 10.0 and 12.0 g per
deciliter in critically ill patients with euvolemia after
initial treatment.

**METHODS**

**Study Population**

We enrolled patients who were admitted to 1 of 22 tertiary-level and 3 community intensive care units in Canada (see the Appendix) between November 1994 and November 1997. We included patients who were expected to stay in the intensive care
unit more than 24 hours, had a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0
g per deciliter or less within 72 hours after admission to the intensive care unit, and were considered to have euvolemia after initial treatment by attending physicians. Patients were excluded for
any of the following reasons: an age of less than 16 years; inability
to receive blood products; active blood loss at the time of enrollment, defined as evidence of ongoing blood loss accompanied by
a decrease in the hemoglobin concentration of 3.0 g per deciliter
in the preceding 12 hours or a requirement for at least 3 units of
packed red cells during the same period; chronic anemia, defined
as a hemoglobin concentration of less than 9.0 g per deciliter on
at least one occasion more than one month before admission to
the hospital; pregnancy; brain death or imminent death (within
24 hours); a question on the part of attending physicians whether
to withhold or withdraw ongoing treatment; and admission after
a routine cardiac surgical procedure. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution, and informed consent was obtained from either the patient or the closest family member before enrollment in the study.

**Study Design and Treatment Protocols**

Consecutive critically ill patients with normovolemia were assigned to one of two treatment groups, stratified according to
center and disease severity (an Acute Physiology and Chronic
Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score of 15 or less or a score of
more than 15, with higher scores indicating more severe disease),[11] and balanced with the use of permuted blocks of four or
six.[12] Sealed, opaque envelopes arranged in a computer-generated
random order were prepared by the data-coordinating center and
distributed to each participating institution, where they were
opened sequentially to determine the patients’ treatment assignments. The envelopes were returned periodically to the coordinating center for auditing.
Transfusion guidelines for both study groups were developed
from information obtained in a national survey of critical care
practitioners in Canada[13] and a pilot study.[14] The hemoglobin
concentrations of patients assigned to the restrictive strategy of
transfusion were maintained in the range of 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter, with a transfusion given when the hemoglobin concentration fell below 7.0 g per deciliter. Among patients assigned to the
liberal strategy of transfusion, the hemoglobin concentrations
were maintained in the range of 10.0 to 12.0 g per deciliter, with
a threshold for transfusion of 10.0 g per deciliter. It was not feasible to mask the assigned transfusion strategy from health care
providers.
In Canada, red cells are separated from whole blood and stored
in citrate–phosphate–dextrose–adenine anticoagulant solution
without leukodepletion. The volume of a unit of red cells ranges
from 240 to 340 ml, with a hematocrit of approximately 80 percent.[15]
The physicians caring for the patients were instructed to administer transfusions, one unit at a time, and to measure a patient’s hemoglobin concentration after each unit was transfused.
Although specific goals for oxygen delivery were not part of the
protocol, we provided suggestions for the use of fluids and vasoactive drugs, when necessary, and advice when a transfusion was
not indicated by the study protocol. All other management decisions were left to the discretion of the patients’ physicians. Adher

ence to the transfusion protocols was required only during the
patient’s stay in the intensive care unit. When a patient was discharged from the intensive care unit, a copy of the American College of Physicians guidelines for transfusion[16] was placed in his or
her medical record.
Compliance with the two transfusion protocols was monitored
by daily measurements of hemoglobin concentrations in each patient. In addition, transfusion records were sent regularly to the
study coordinating center, which monitored the ability of individual
centers to maintain hemoglobin concentrations in the target range.

**Base-Line Assessment and Data Collection**

At the time of randomization, demographic, diagnostic, and
therapeutic information as well as information necessary to determine the severity of illness — including APACHE II scores,[11] calculated from data gathered within 24 hours after admission to the
intensive care unit, and the multiple-organ-dysfunction score[17] —
was obtained for each patient. The worst laboratory values recorded during each patient’s stay in the intensive care unit were
noted for use in assessing organ dysfunction with use of the multiple-organ-dysfunction score[17] and the multiple-system organfailure score.[18] Hemoglobin concentrations; the use of red-cell
transfusions; medications given, including vasoactive drugs; and
the need for mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and surgical intervention were recorded on a daily basis.
The principal reason for admission to the intensive care unit
was recorded. We included as many as three secondary diagnoses
and eight coexisting conditions. In postoperative patients, the underlying diagnosis and the surgical procedure were recorded. All
data were abstracted from clinical records by trained study personnel and coded according to the International Classification of
_Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification. All diagnoses were_
reviewed by two of the four critical care physicians, and disagreements were resolved by consensus.

**Outcome Measures**

The primary outcome measure was death from all causes in the
30 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included 60day rates of death from all causes, mortality rates during the stay
in the intensive care unit and during hospitalization, and survival
times in the first 30 days. Measures of organ failure and dysfunction, including the number and rates of organ failure as defined
previously[18] and the multiple-organ-dysfunction score,[17] were also
assessed. To improve our ability to detect meaningful differences
between groups, we used some composite outcomes that included death and organ dysfunction or failure as indicators of morbidity. Patients who died were assigned a multiple-system organ-failure score of 7 and a multiple-organ-dysfunction score of 24, the
worst possible values for each scale, as a means of adjusting measures of organ dysfunction and failure for deaths. Lengths of stays
in the intensive care unit and the hospital were also recorded.

**Statistical Analysis**

Since this was an equivalency trial, we used 95 percent confidence intervals to estimate the number of patients necessary for
the study to have the power to rule out clinically meaningful differences in outcomes. We estimated that 2300 patients would be
needed to rule out an absolute difference of 4 percent in 30-day
mortality between the two groups, assuming a combined mortality rate of 18 percent (the rate for a group receiving standard care
was estimated to be 20 percent[3]). An interim analysis conducted
in a blinded fashion by the data-monitoring committee after 404
patients had been enrolled revealed that the combined 30-day
mortality rate was actually 23 percent. This change increased the
detectable difference to 4.5 percent for a sample of 2300 patients.
Because of this increase in observed mortality, we decided to decrease the target sample to 1620 patients (primarily on the basis
of the hypothesis-testing method, in which the mortality rate for
the standard-care group was 26.6 percent, the type 1 and type 2
error rates were 5 percent, and there was no change in the relative

risk of 27.5 percent from the original estimate of sample size).
The recalculated sample size allowed us to rule out an absolute
difference in the 30-day mortality rate of 5.5 percent between
groups.
The final analysis was conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.
Comparisons of hemoglobin concentrations over time were made
with use of analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed
by Tukey’s honestly-significant-difference test for pairwise comparisons.
Mortality rates, the number of organs that failed per patient,
and the rates of multiorgan failure were compared with use of
Fisher’s exact test. A forward, stepwise logistic-regression procedure was then performed to adjust raw mortality data with use of
covariates that were found to be significant predictors of outcomes. Covariates were entered into the logistic model at a P value of «0.10. A second logistic regression was performed in which
potential confounders, including age, APACHE II score, coexisting illnesses, diagnostic category, and study center, were forced
into the model. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for each group
were compared with use of a log-rank test statistic. Multipleorgan-dysfunction scores were analyzed with use of an independent t-test. To account for the influence of death on the assessment
of organ failure and organ dysfunction, we conducted an additional analysis in which all patients who died were assigned the
maximal scores. The complication rates were compared with use


of a chi-square test. Lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and
the hospital were analyzed with use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test for independent samples.
A priori subgroup analyses of patients at potential risk for the
adverse effects of anemia included patients who were 55 years of
age or older, patients with cardiac disease, and patients with
APACHE II scores indicating more severe illness. In the final
analysis, we increased the threshold value for APACHE II scores
from 15 to 20 because less than 20 percent of all patients had an
APACHE II score below 15 and because a score of 20 was considered to be a better indicator of severe illness. We also examined
patients with systemic infections. Differences in primary outcomes were considered statistically significant when the overall
two-sided alpha level was 0.05 or less. No adjustments were made
for multiple comparisons. Where appropriate, absolute P values
are reported with 95 percent confidence intervals for differences
between the groups.

rolled in the study: 418 patients were assigned to a
restrictive strategy of transfusion and 420 were assigned to a liberal strategy of transfusion. The consent rate was 41 percent (838 of 2039 patients). As
compared with the patients who were enrolled in
the study, those who were not enrolled were slightly
older (mean [±SD] age, 57.6±18.2 vs. 59.4±18.8
years; P=0.04), but they had similar APACHE II
scores (P=0.36) and diagnoses (P=0.26) with the
exception of cardiac disease. Twenty-six percent of
enrolled patients had cardiac disease, as compared
with 20 percent of those who were not enrolled
(P<0.01). Nine patients (1 percent) did not complete the trial; four were in the liberal-strategy group
and five were in the restrictive-strategy group. Three
additional patients were lost to follow-up at 60 days.
The executive committee, without foreknowledge of
treatment-specific outcomes, decided to terminate
the study prematurely because of a decrease in enrollment to below 20 percent of predicted levels over
a period of several months.
There were no significant differences in any baseline characteristics between the two groups (Table
1). The two most common reasons for admission to
the intensive care unit were respiratory and cardiac
diseases. The average APACHE II score was 21, and
more than 80 percent of the patients were receiving
mechanical ventilation. A total of 222 patients (26.5
percent) had an infection as either a primary or a
secondary diagnosis.

**Success of Treatment**

The average daily hemoglobin concentrations
were 8.5±0.7 g per deciliter in the restrictive-strategy group and 10.7±0.7 g per deciliter in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.01). The average hemoglobin concentrations also differed significantly between
the groups during each day of the 30-day study (P<
0.01). An average of 2.6±4.1 red-cell units per patient was administered in the restrictive-strategy
group, as compared with an average of 5.6±5.3 units
per patient in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.01).
This equals a relative decrease of 54 percent in the
number of transfusions when the lower threshold was
used. In addition, 33 percent of the patients in the restrictive-strategy group did not receive any red cells
after randomization, as compared with 0 percent of
the patients in the liberal-strategy group (P<0.01).
Noncompliance of physicians with the study regimen, as indicated by a finding of hemoglobin concentrations outside the prespecified ranges for at
least 48 hours, occurred in 4.3 percent of patients in
the liberal-strategy group (18 of 420) and 1.4 percent of patients in the restrictive-strategy group (6 of
418) (P=0.02). A subgroup of these patients were
inadvertently crossed over from one group to the
other when physicians either administered or withheld red-cell transfusions. The overall rate of cross

over was 1.8 percent (15 of 838): 2.6 percent (11)
in the liberal-strategy group and 1 percent (4) in the
restrictive-strategy group (P=0.12).
Given that the investigators were aware of the patients’ treatment assignments, other interventions may
have influenced outcomes. The use of medications,
including vasoactive drugs; the administration of fluids and daily fluid balance; and the use of pulmonary-artery catheters were similar in both groups
throughout the stay in the intensive care unit (P=
0.15). The use of other interventions such as dialysis, mechanical ventilation, and surgical procedures
was also similar (P=0.58).

**Outcome Measures**

The primary outcome — the rate of death from
all causes in the 30 days after admission to the intensive care unit — was 18.7 percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 23.3 percent in the liberalstrategy group (95 percent confidence interval for
the difference between the groups, ¡0.84 percent
to 10.2 percent; P=0.11) (Table 2). The mortality
rates during hospitalization were lower in the restrictive-strategy group (22.2 percent vs. 28.1 percent,
P=0.05). Other mortality rates including the mortality rate during the entire stay in the intensive care
unit (13.9 percent vs. 16.2 percent, P=0.29) and


the 60-day mortality rate (22.7 percent vs. 26.5 percent, P=0.23) were also lower in the restrictivestrategy group but not significantly so.
Kaplan–Meier survival curves were similar for the
patient group as a whole, but they were significantly different in the subgroup of patients with an
APACHE II score of 20 or less (P=0.02) and in the
subgroup of patients who were younger than 55 years
(P=0.02) (Fig. 2). The unadjusted odds ratio for
death within 30 days in the restrictive-strategy group
as compared with the liberal-strategy group was
0.75 (P=0.09). Adjustment for the influence of age,
APACHE II score, diagnosis, and coexisting illnesses
with use of logistic-regression analysis did not change
the odds ratio significantly (odds ratio, 0.72; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.50 to 1.07; P=0.07).
The number of patients with multiorgan failure
(more than three organs), which was analyzed as
a dichotomous variable (present or absent) for each
of seven organ systems,[18] was not significantly different between the restrictive-strategy and liberal-strategy groups (5.3 percent vs. 4.3 percent, P=0.36).
The mean multiple-organ-dysfunction score was marginally lower in the restrictive-strategy group than
in the liberal-strategy group (8.3±4.6 vs. 8.8±4.4,
P=0.10).
We also examined composite outcomes. When or

gan-failure scores of 7 were assigned to all patients
who died within 30 days after admission to the intensive care unit, the number of patients with multiorgan failure was substantially increased in both
groups, and the results were marginally better in the
restrictive-strategy group (20.6 percent vs. 26.0 percent, P=0.07). Similarly, when all patients who died
were given a multiple-organ-dysfunction score of
24, the total scores (P=0.03) and the changes in the
scores from base line (P=0.04) were significantly
lower in the restrictive-strategy group (Table 2).
Cardiac events, primarily pulmonary edema and
myocardial infarction, were more frequent in the liberal-strategy group than in the restrictive-strategy
group during the stay in the intensive care unit
(P<0.01) (Table 3). However, there were no significant differences in the rates of cardiac events (41 percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 44 percent
in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.86), infectious
complications (3 percent and 4 percent, respectively;
P=1.00), or multiorgan failure (37 percent and 32
percent, respectively; P=0.59) in the 48 hours preceding death among the patients who died (Table 4).

**Subgroup Analyses**

When the patients were analyzed according to age
(<55 years vs. »55 years) and APACHE II score
(«20 vs. >20), there were no significant differences
in base-line characteristics. In the restrictive-strategy
group, 173 patients were younger than 55 years, 207
patients had an APACHE II score of 20 or less, 151
patients had cardiac disease, 100 had a traumatic injury, and 114 had a severe infection or septic shock.
In the liberal-strategy group, 161 patients were
younger than 55 years, 217 had an APACHE II
score of 20 or less, 175 had cardiac disease, 100 had
a traumatic injury, and 104 had a severe infection or
septic shock. All outcomes in the two transfusionstrategy groups were similar for the patients who
were older than 55 years and for those with an
APACHE II score of more than 20 (P>0.36). However, 30-day mortality was significantly lower in the
restrictive-strategy group than in the liberal-strategy
group among the patients with an APACHE II score
of 20 or less (8.7 percent vs. 16.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval for the absolute difference,
1.0 to 13.6 percent; P=0.03) and among the patients who were less than 55 years of age (5.7 percent vs. 13.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval,
1.1 to 13.5 percent; P=0.02). There were no significant differences in 30-day mortality between treatment groups in the subgroup of patients with a primary or secondary diagnosis of cardiac disease (20.5
percent in the restrictive-strategy group and 22.9
percent in the liberal-strategy group; 95 percent
confidence interval for the difference, ¡6.7 to 11.3
percent; P=0.69), in the subgroup of patients with

29.7 percent, respectively; P=0.36), or in the subgroup of patients with trauma (10.0 percent and 8.8
percent, respectively; P=0.81).
The results for the rates of organ dysfunction in the
subgroups were similar to those for other subgroup
analyses. The multiple-organ-dysfunction scores adjusted for patients who died did not differ significantly in the subgroup of patients with an APACHE
II score of more than 20, the subgroup more than
55 years of age, and the subgroup with specific diagnoses, including cardiac disease, trauma, and severe infections and septic shock (all P>0.30). However, adjusted multiple-organ-dysfunction scores were
significantly lower in the subgroup of patients with
an APACHE II score of 20 or less (8.3±6.2 in the
restrictive-strategy group and 10.0±7.2 in the liberal-strategy group, P=0.01) and in the subgroup of
patients who were younger than 55 years of age
(8.8±5.7 and 10.3±6.6, respectively; P=0.03).

**DISCUSSION**
Our findings indicate that the use of a threshold
for red-cell transfusion as low as 7.0 g of hemoglobin per deciliter, combined with maintenance of he

moglobin concentrations in the range of 7.0 to
9.0 g per deciliter, was at least as effective as and
possibly superior to a liberal transfusion strategy
(threshold, 10.0 g per deciliter; maintenance range,
10.0 to 12.0) in critically ill patients with normovolemia. There was a trend toward decreased 30-day
mortality among patients who were treated according to the restrictive transfusion strategy. The significant differences in mortality rates during hospitalization, rates of cardiac complications, and rates of
organ dysfunction all favored the restrictive strategy.
We also found that maintaining hemoglobin concentrations in the range of 7.0 to 9.0 g per deciliter
decreased the average number of red-cell units transfused by 54 percent and decreased exposure to any
red cells after randomization by 33 percent. Concern about exposure to blood products has increased
the use of expensive drugs such as epoetin alfa and
aprotinin, which reduce perioperative exposure by
an average of one to two red-cell units, with little evidence of overall effectiveness. In contrast, a simple
and inexpensive intervention that lowers the transfusion threshold improved clinical outcomes and reduced exposure to red cells.

A recent systematic review of transfusion practice[19] identified five randomized, controlled clinical
trials that compared clinical outcomes after the implementation of two transfusion strategies. The only
large trial, in patients with chronic anemia due to
sickle cell disease, did not demonstrate decreases in
the incidence of sickle cell crises among patients
assigned to a liberal transfusion strategy.[20] The four
other trials were quite small. Two studies in patients
undergoing bypass surgery[21,22] and our pilot study[14]
did not find differences between the transfusion
strategies but were too small to yield clinically useful
inferences. The fifth trial, in patients with nonvariceal gastrointestinal hemorrhage, found that administering transfusions liberally or expectantly resulted
not only in increased overall use of transfusions but
also in a higher frequency of coagulation abnormalities.[23]


A number of randomized, controlled clinical trials
have addressed the hypothesis that oxygen delivery
should be increased or maintained at high levels to
minimize the effects of tissue hypoxia caused by disease processes that interfere with oxygen delivery or
the body’s ability to extract oxygen. One meta-analysis[24] found that oxygen delivery was increased when
oxygen therapy was initiated preoperatively, but this
benefit was not observed in studies that evaluated
patients admitted to the intensive care unit. In all
the previous studies, the transfusion thresholds exceeded 10.0 g per deciliter; therefore, it was not possible to make inferences about optimal strategies for
red-cell transfusion. In our study, red-cell transfusions, used as a means of augmenting oxygen delivery, did not offer any survival advantage in patients
with normovolemia when hemoglobin concentrations exceeded 7.0 g per deciliter.
There is also concern about the adverse effects of
anemia in patients with ischemic heart disease. Two
large cohort studies found that an increasing severity
of anemia was associated with a disproportionate increase in mortality rates among patients with ischemic heart disease.[2,3] In our study, however, patients
with diagnoses of cardiac disease did not have more
adverse outcomes when a transfusion threshold of
7.0 g per deciliter was used. The apparent discrepancy between our results and those of previous studies
may be the result of confounding[3] or an inability to
document the negative effects of transfusion[2] in the
observational studies.
In most clinical trials, there are more patients who
are asked to participate than actually agree to participate. There is therefore a possibility that refusals on
the part of patients, their surrogates, or their physicians affect the generalizability of the results. A
greater proportion of patients with severe cardiac
disease than with other types of disease had attending physicians who declined to enroll them in our
study. Nevertheless, we believe that a restrictive strategy can be implemented in patients with coronary
artery disease but should be considered with caution
in patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina.
On the basis of our results, we recommend that
critically ill patients receive red-cell transfusions
when their hemoglobin concentrations fall below
7.0 g per deciliter and that hemoglobin concentrations should be maintained between 7.0 and 9.0 g per
deciliter. The diversity of the patients enrolled in this
trial and the consistency of the results suggest that
our conclusions may be generalized to most critically ill patients, with the possible exception of patients
with active coronary ischemic syndromes.
