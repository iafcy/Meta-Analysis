### Summary
**Background No consensus exists on whether preoperative blood transfusions are benefi cial in patients with sickle-cell**
**disease. We assessed whether perioperative complication rates would be altered by preoperative transfusion.**

**Methods We did a multicentre, randomised trial. Eligible patients were aged at least 1 year, had haemoglobin SS or**
**Sβ⁰thalassaemia sickle-cell-disease subtypes, and were scheduled for low-risk or medium-risk operations. Patients**
**were randomly assigned no transfusion or transfusion no more than 10 days before surgery. The primary outcome**
**was the proportion of clinically important complications between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. Analysis**
**was by intention to treat.**

**Findings 67 (96%) of 70 enrolled patients—33 no preoperative transfusion and 34 preoperative transfusion—were**
**assessed. 65 (97%) of 67 patients had the haemoglobin SS subtype and 54 (81%) were scheduled to undergo medium-**
**risk surgery. 13 (39%) of 33 patients in the no-preoperative-transfusion group had clinically important complications,**
**compared with fi ve (15%) in the preoperative-transfusion group (p=0·023). Of these, 10 (30%) and one (3%),**
**respectively, had serious adverse events. The unadjusted odds ratio of clinically important complications was 3·8**
**(95% CI 1·2–12·2, p=0·027). 10 (91%) of 11 serious adverse events were acute chest syndrome (nine in the no-**
**preoperative-transfusion group and one in the preoperative-transfusion group). Duration of hospital stay and**
**readmission rates did not diff er between study groups.**

**Interpretation Preoperative transfusion was associated with decreased perioperative complications in patients with**
**sickle-cell disease in this trial. This approach could, therefore, be benefi cial for patients with the haemoglobin SS**
**subtype who are scheduled to undergo low-risk and medium-risk surgeries.**

### Introduction
Many patients with sickle-cell disease require surgery,
particularly abdominal, orthopaedic, or ear, nose, and
throat procedures, because of disorders such as obstructive sleep apnoea, adenotonsillar hypertrophy, cholelithiasis, splenic sequestration, and avascular ne crosis. The
rate of perioperative complications varies according to
the clinical severity of the disorder and the type of
operation but, overall, complications related and not
related to sickle-cell disease are common.[1–4]

Preoperative blood transfusion, which decreases the
proportion of sickle red blood cells, suppresses erythropoiesis, and improves anaemia, has been associated
with decreased risk of complications related to sicklecell disease, but is also associated with acute transfusion
reactions, alloimmunisation, and delayed haemolytic
trans fusion reactions. One view is that transfusion is
immuno suppressive and might increase the risk of
postoperative infections.[4] Although the risks of posttransfusion HIV or hepatitis infections are low in the
developed world, they remain high in sub-Saharan
Africa.[5] With potential new transfusion hazards, such
as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease[6,7] and West Nile


virus,[8,9] the risks of transfusion need to be balanced
against its benefi ts.
A randomised controlled trial showed no signifi cant
diff erence in postoperative complication rates between two
groups of patients with sickle-cell disease who received
either intensive (exchange) or conservative (top-up)
preoperative transfusion,[10] but the trial did not include a
no-transfusion group. Several observational studies have
shown benefi ts with transfusion, but others have shown
no benefi ts, and studies from countries with low availability
of blood for transfusion or from centres that do not
routinely off er preoperative blood transfusion do not show
increased perioperative complication rates.[2,11–16] Improved
surgical and anaesthetic techniques have led to decreases
in perioperative complication rates.[17] A UK survey of
surgery done in 2002–03 in patients with sickle-cell disease
showed large variation in transfusion practice, with 43% of
patients receiving no preoperative transfusion.[3] Similar
variations in practice have been reported in the USA.[18]

Owing to the lack of conclusive evidence about the
benefi t of preoperative blood transfusion,[4] we did the
Transfusion Alternatives Preoperatively in Sickle Cell
Disease (TAPS) study to investigate whether routine

chest syndrome, oxygen saturation lower than 90%,
current renal dialysis, and a history of stroke in children.
All patients or their parents or guardians provided written
informed consent.

#### Randomisation
Patients were allocated treatment by an independent,
centralised online randomisation service. Block randomisation was used to avoid centre eff ects, and patients
were stratifi ed by surgical risk (low or medium), age (1–6,
7–16, 17–39, or 40 years or older), and history of
complications related to sickle-cell disease (no or yes),
defi ned as more than three admissions to hospital
requiring opioid analgesia in the previous 12 months,
steady-state oxygen saturation of 90–94%, previously
diagnosed pulmonary hypertension, creatinine concentration higher than 100 μmol/L, or history of stroke as an
adult. Patients could be randomised up to two times
provided that procedures were at least 6 months apart.
Patients having additional procedures were excluded to
avoid the risk of within-patient bias.
The randomisation groups were no preoperative
transfusion or a preoperative red-cell transfusion within
10 days before surgery, with transfusion aimed at
increasing haemoglobin concentration to 100 g/L. In
patients who presented with haemoglobin concentrations
lower than 90 g/L, a top-up transfusion was used, whereas
in those with baseline haemoglobin levels of 90 g/L or
higher, partial exchange transfusion was used to achieve
an estimated haemoglobin S per centage of less than 60%.
Standard prestorage leucocyte-depleted red blood cells
were used, and blood was fully matched for ABO, fullRhesus phenotype (Cc/D/Ee), and K1 antigen, plus any
other antigens to which the patient had antibodies.
Doctors and patients were aware of treatment allocations.

#### Perioperative care
A care protocol developed for the trial was given to study
centres for guidance; its use was not mandatory and
centres could follow their own standards of perioperative
care to ensure maximum applicability of results to the
usual-care setting.[20] Recommendations included intravenous fl uids if the patient was nil by mouth for more
than 2 h before surgery, and to continue after surgery until
oral administration of fl uids could be tolerated; careful
monitoring of oxygenation to maintain oxygen saturation
at more than 96% on air; and thrombo prophylaxis if the
patient was immobile for longer than 24 h. We placed no
restrictions on concurrent medication or enrolment in
other studies while patients were in the trial.

#### Assessment of alloimmunisation
A blood sample was taken from each patient at trial
entry for measurement of red-cell alloantibodies.
Samples were assessed in local laboratories by standard
methods but stored centrally during the study. Another
blood sample was taken from each patient at 3 months

preoperative transfusion would aff ect the overall perioperative complication rate in patients with sicklecell disease.

### Methods
#### Study design and patients
TAPS was a multicentre, randomised, controlled clinical
trial with a group sequential superiority design.[19] The
study involved 22 sites in Canada, Ireland, the
Netherlands, and the UK, between November, 2007, and
March, 2011.
Eligible patients had haemoglobin SS (HbSS) or
haemoglobin Sβ⁰thalassaemia (HbSβ⁰thal) sickle-celldisease subtypes, were aged at least 1 year, and were
scheduled to undergo low-risk or medium-risk elective
surgery (under general or regional anaesthesia) within the
next 28 days. Surgeries were classifi ed according to the
Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease criteria
(appendix p 1).[2] Low-risk surgery included adenoid ectomy
and inguinal-hernia repair, and medium-risk surgery
included cholecystectomy and joint replace ment. Operations not on the Co-operative Study of Sickle Cell Disease
list were classifi ed after discussion with the trial
investigators. Patients scheduled to undergo high-risk
operations, such as cardio vascular or brain surgery, were
excluded. Other exclusion criteria were haemoglobin
levels lower than 65 g/L, blood transfusion within the
previous 3 months, history of acute chest syndrome
within the previous 6 months or intubation and
mechanical ventilation ever for the treatment of acute

after surgery and was tested in central laboratories
(Reference Laboratory, Colindale, in the UK, and the
local central laboratory in each of the other countries). If
red-cell antibodies were identifi ed in the post operative
sample, it was tested again in parallel with the
preoperative sample to assess whether or not the antibody was newly formed. Information on previous alloantibodies was not captured for the trial because there
was no central source of such data and many patients
were treated at multiple hospitals.

#### Assessment of quality of life and cost-eff ectiveness
We assessed quality of life with the EQ-5D health
outcomes questionnaire. Scores were collected at baseline and at 1–3 months after surgery for patients aged
12 years and older. On the basis of the responses, we
calculated quality-adjusted life-years to assess costeff ectiveness.

#### Statistical methods
The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with
clinically important compli cations between randomisation and 30 days after surgery. This timeframe was
deemed suffi cient to capture all complications triggered
by the surgery or preoperative transfusions. Clinically
important complications were classifi ed as being related
to sickle-cell disease, infection, surgery, or transfusion,
and defi nitions were provided to study centres (appendix
p 5).[21] Detailed reports of complications were scrutinised
by an inde pendent endpoint review panel that was
unaware of treatment allocations to assess whether
events satisfi ed the trial defi nitions. Complications that
were life threat ening or resulted in death, permanent or
severe disability, or other important medical outcomes
(appendix p 5) were additionally reported as serious
adverse events (SAEs) and were reviewed by the
independent data monitoring committee.
Secondary outcomes were total number of inpatient
days, number of red-cell units received during and after
surgery, and readmission or non-discharge by 30 days
after surgery. We also assessed a composite outcome of
the primary outcome plus alloimmunisation at 3 months
after surgery.
In a national survey of practices in the UK, 26% of
transfused patients with sickle-cell disease had complications.[3] We therefore set a baseline complication rate
of 25% for this study. We aimed to detect a diff erence of
at least 10% in either direction in the complication rates
of the two study groups. For a double-triangular group
sequential design, we calculated that to achieve power
of 90% and a 5% signifi cance level, to be assessed by
interim analyses after every 40 patients, the required
overall sample size would be 405 patients. We used PEST
software (version 4.4) to make the calculations, as it
adjusts for multiple analyses of data.
Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for the primary outcome in the intention-to-treat population were calculated


with an unadjusted logistic regression model that
excluded patients randomised in error. The robustness of
study results was checked by performing a per-protocol
analy sis that also excluded patients ran domised in error
as well as withdrawn patients, those who did not receive
their allocated treatment, and those who underwent
trans fusion more than 10 days before surgery. Additionally, we did an intention-to-treat analysis of the primary
outcome with adjustment for stratifi cation factors (age at
random isation, risk level of surgery, and history of sickle
compli cations). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.
gov and ISRCTN Register, numbers NCT00512577 and
ISRCTN00862331.

### Results
343 patients were screened, of whom 86 (25%) were
scheduled to undergo low-risk surgery and 257 (75%)
medium-risk surgery. Of these patients, 273 (80%) were
excluded (fi gure). Among these, 99 (36%) were deemed
ineligible, mainly because of transfusion within the past
3 months (58 [59%]), haemoglobin levels lower than
65 g/L (16 [16%]), and acute chest syndrome within the
past 6 months (12 [12%]). Other reasons were history of
stroke (n=7), oxygen saturation lower than 90% (n=5),


and already having been entered into the trial twice (n=1).
Of the 99 ineligible patients, the intended transfusion
plan was available for only 55 (56%), of whom 40 (73%)
were scheduled to receive a preoperative trans fusion.
Of 73 patients excluded by clinicians, 32 (44%) were
scheduled to undergo orthopaedic surgery, 11 (15%) abdominal procedures, and 14 (19%) ear, nose, and throat
procedures; the remaining 16 patients were due to have
other low-risk surgeries. Clinicians excluded 23 (32%) of
these 73 patients because they defi nitely wanted them to
have a preoperative transfusion, 13 (18%) because they
did not want to give preoperative transfusion at all, but in
37 (51%) no transfusion plan was stated. Of 58 patients
who refused consent, 21 (36%) did so because they did
not wish to undergo transfusion and four (7%) did so
because they wanted preoperative transfusion, with the
remainder refusing for other reasons.
The fi rst interim analysis, done in September, 2010, after
40 patients had completed 30-day postoperative follow-up,
indicated that the trial should continue, as no stopping
boundaries had been crossed on the basis of the primary
outcome. An emerging imbalance in SAEs that had
become increasingly marked by February, 2011, was noted
between the two groups by the independent data monitoring committee. At this point, therefore, the committee
requested an unscheduled interim analysis, which was
undertaken for 61 patients with complete data. The
proportion of patients with clinically important complications did not diff er signifi cantly between groups
(11 [37%] of 30 in the no-preoperative-transfusion group vs
fi ve [16%] of 31 in the preoperative-transfusion group;
diff erence 20·5%, 95% CI –0·1 to 42·1, p=0·068). The
proportion of patients with SAEs in each group at this
point, however, did diff er signifi cantly (10 [33%] of 30 _vs_
one [3%] of 31; diff erence 30·1%, 95% CI 12·1–48·1,
p=0·002). In view of the potential risk to patients’ safety,
the independent data monitoring com mittee recommended that the trial steering committee consider early
closure of the study, to which they agreed in March, 2011.
At trial closure, 70 patients had been recruited.
Of the 70 patients enrolled, 13 (19%) were scheduled to
have low-risk operations and 57 (81%) to have mediumrisk operations. Three patients were randomised in error
and, therefore, only 67 patients were included in the
intention-to-treat analysis (33 in the no-preoperativetransfusion and 34 in the preoperative-transfusion group;
fi gure), including six for whom we did not have postoperative data at trial closure because they had been
followed up for less than 30 days. Two patients were
entered into the trial twice, and had diff erent study
numbers each time. Two patients in the transfusion
group withdrew from treatment, but only one had no
postoperative data and, therefore, outcomes were
assessed in 33 patients in each group (fi gure).
The baseline characteristics of patients in the two
groups were similar (table 1). Haemoglobin concentrations were similar overall but were higher in the

preoperative-transfusion group than in the no-preoperative-transfusion group before surgery, as expected
(table 2). One patient in the no-preoperative-transfusion
group received a pre opera tive transfusion because the
haemoglobin concentration fell to lower than 65 g/L
between randomisation and surgery (table 2). In the
preoperative-transfusion group, 26 (76%) of 34 patients
received top-up transfusions, and fi ve (15%) received
partial exchange transfusions (me dian pre operative
percentage of haemoglobin S achieved 47·2%, IQR
43·1–50·4). The three remaining patients were not
transfused preoperatively, including the two who
withdrew (table 2). The interval between transfusion and
surgery was more than 10 days in fi ve patients, 5–10 days
in four, and less than 5 days for 22 (fi ve within 24 h before
surgery, two on the previous day, and precise timings
unknown for 15). Perioperative manage ment was simi lar
in the two groups, and involved intravenous fl uids,
heparin, antibiotics, and supple mental oxygen. The
median haemo globin concentration after surgery was
higher in the preoperative-transfusion group than in
the no-preoperative-trans fusion group (table 2). Only
13 operations were classifi ed as low risk—fi ve in the nopreoperative-transfusion group and eight in the
preoperative-transfusion group.
Overall, 18 patients had 22 clinically important complications, among whom 14 patients had 15 events related to
sickle-cell disease (table 3). The most frequent event
related to sickle-cell disease was acute chest syndrome,
which was seen in nine patients in the no-preoperativetransfusion group and in one in the preoperative-transfusion group (tables 3, 4). Four patients had post operative


acute vaso-occlusive pain, and one had a tran sient
complication of the central nervous system with no
sequelae (table 3). No compli cations occurred between
randomisation and surgery. The median time between
surgery and any complication was 2·5 (IQR 1·5–4·5)
days. The proportion of patients with clinically relevant
complications was higher in the no-preoperativetransfusion group than in the pre operative-transfusion
group (table 3). The OR for clinically important
complications was 3·8 (95% CI 1·2–12·2), which
indicates signifi cantly higher risk of complications
without preoperative transfusion (p=0·027).
The per-protocol analysis for the primary outcome
included 58 patients, 32 in the no-transfusion group and
26 in the preoperative-transfusion group. Nine patients
from the intention-to-treat cohort were excluded from
this analysis: two in the preoperative-transfusion group
withdrew from treatment and seven patients with
protocol deviations (fi ve in the preoperative-transfusion
group who underwent transfusion more than 10 days
before surgery and one who had no transfusion because
of clinician reluctance, and one in the no-preoperativetransfusion group who received a preoperative transfusion because of a fall in haemoglobin concentration).
The per-protocol analysis corroborated the intention-totreat fi ndings (OR 3·8, 95% CI 1·0–13·5, p=0·042).
When adjustment was made for stratifi cation factors
at baseline in the intention-to-treat cohort, the risk of
clinically important complications remained similar (OR
3·4, 95% CI 1·0–11·8, p=0·049). None of the stratifi cation
factors showed a signifi cant eff ect on the proportion of
patients who had clinically important complications.

A notable overlap was seen for clinically important
complications and SAEs, with the diff erence between
study groups in the proportions of patients who had
complications being attributable largely to an excess of
SAEs, which were reported in ten patients in the notransfusion group and only one in the preoperativetransfusion group (diff erence 27·4%, 95% CI 10·7–44·0,
p=0·003; tables 3, 4). All but one of the 11 patients with
SAEs had acute chest syndrome, of whom two required
admission to intensive care, and eight required intraoperative or postoperative trans fusions. One patient in
the no-transfusion group had acute chest syndrome after
low-risk surgery, whereas all other patients with this
complication had undergone medium-risk operations.
One patient had two SAEs: severe intraoperative bleeding
and acute chest syndrome (table 4). All patients with
SAEs recovered fully.
Owing to the limited number of patients, the analysis of
secondary outcome measures was descriptive. Only one
patient in the preoperative-trans fusion group developed a


red-cell alloantibody (anti-S) 3 months after surgery. This
patient also had a clinically important complication. The
length of stay did not diff er between study groups (mean
5·4 [SD 3·7] days in the no-preoperative-transfusion
group vs 4·8 [SD 3·6] days in the preoperative-transfusion
group, 95% CI –1·2 to 2·4, p=0.521). All patients were discharged within 30 days of surgery. The rate of re admission
was higher in the no-preoperative-transfusion group than
in the pre operative-transfusion group (fi ve patients vs one
patient), but this diff erence was not signifi cant (diff erence
12·2%, 95% CI –1·3 to 25·7, p=0·08). 12 patients in the
no-preoperative-transfusion group required blood transfusion intraoperatively or postoperatively compared with
only three patients in the preoperative-transfusion group
(diff erence 27·5%, 95% CI 8·6–46·5, p=0·007; table 5).
Transfusions were required because of com plications in
11 of these 15 patients, of whom eight had acute chest
syndrome and one had a severe postoperative painful
crisis, and, therefore, was related to complication rate
rather than study group allocation.
Complete EQ-5D data were available for 29 patients.
Mean health-related quality-of-life scores were higher in
the preoperative-transfusion group than in the no-preoperative-transfusion group when baseline EQ-5D was
controlled for (diff erence 0·024, 95% CI –0·093 to 0·141,
p=0·675). Data on use of resources were available for
64 patients. Patients in the preoperative-transfusion group
spent a mean of 0·64 fewer days in hospital than did
patients in the no-transfusion group (95% CI –1·16 to
2·44, p=0·478) but received an average of 0·85 more units
of blood (95% CI –0·07 to 1·77, p=0·071). The overall cost
of resources during the study was lower for the
preoperative-transfusion group, with the diff erence
between groups being UK£440 (95% CI –595 to 1476,
p=0·399). Preoperative transfusions, there fore, had a 79%
probability of being cost eff ective at a cost-eff ectiveness
threshold of £20 000 per quality-adjusted life year.

### Discussion
Although limited by early closure and the small number
of patients enrolled, our fi ndings indicate that rates of
clinically important complications and SAEs were
signifi cantly higher in patients with sickle-cell disease
who received no preoperative transfusion than in those
who did. Additionally, without preoperative transfusion,
the need for perioperative transfusion was increased.
Confi rmation of this fi nding in other trials would be
ideal, but the logistical and recruitment issues we
experienced suggest that further trials are unlikely. A
prospective registry to capture data is an option, but
rigorous data capture would be necessary to avoid bias.
Benefi ts of preoperative transfusion in patients with
sickle-cell disease have not been previously reported in a
randomised controlled trial. Another randomised controlled trial of preoperative transfusion showed the
opposite result, with fewer complications in the notransfusion group [24] The patients in that study however

were from an Arab population, and such populations
generally have milder phenotypes than the mainly AfroCaribbean population in our study,[25] and the report
included few details of the methods, analysis, or results
to support the conclusions. The benefi ts we found could
have been related to the additional hospital visit for
patients in the preoperative-transfusion group. However,
this eff ect seems unlikely, because all patients underwent
a pre operative assessment at which perioperative advice
was given. The rates of clinically important complications
(fi ve [15%] of 34) and specifi cally of acute chest syndrome
(one [3%] of 34) in preoperative-transfusion group were
lower than rates reported in previous studies.[2,3,10,14,26] This
diff erence could be due to improvements in surgical and
anaesthesia techniques (table 6). Although our trial was
not blinded, there is no evidence to suggest that this
approach aff ected management decisions. The rates of
total clinically important complications (13 [39%]) and
acute chest syndrome (nine [27%] of 33) in our nopreoperative-transfusion group were higher than those
in previous observational studies (table 6),[2,3,12.14,16] which
might have been due to our trial including patients who
underwent either low-risk or medium-risk operations.
Some, although not all, previous studies have identifi ed
pulmonary disease[27–29] and abdominal surgery[26,28] as risk
factors for acute chest syndrome in patients with


sickle-cell disease, although some groups have performed
abdominal surgery successfully without preoperative
transfusion.[12,29] In this trial, the high rates of acute chest
syndrome might have been due to the high proportion of
patients undergoing abdominal surgery (23 [34%] of 67).
Low oxygen saturations and pulmonary hyper tension
were included as part of the stratifi cation factor history of
sickle-cell disease and no relation was found between
them and the risk of acute chest syndrome.
Only one episode of alloimmunisation was seen
overall, which compares favourably with a previously
reported rate of 7·5% in patients transfused preoperatively.[10] The lower rate in our study might be related
to the extension of red-cell matching to full Rhesus
phenotype and K1 antigens. Alternatively, it could
represent a lower previous trans fusion burden in our
trial population than in other trials. The lengths of stay
and proportions of patients readmitted did not diff er
signifi cantly between the two study groups, despite the
diff erence in rates of SAEs. Use of preoperative transfusion seemed cost eff ective and to result in improved
quality of life. A formal cost-eff ectiveness analysis will be
detailed in a separate paper.
Baseline characteristics showed that our study sample
was typical of patients with the haemoglobin SS
sickle-cell-disease subtype and did not display markedly

**_Panel: Research in context_**

**Systematic review**
We searched Medline for full papers published from January, 1978, to December, 2011,
that reported randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses. We used the search terms
“sickle cell” and “transfusion”, “operative”, or both. We identifi ed two randomised clinical
trials[10,22] and many observational studies, plus a recently updated Cochrane review.[4]

**Interpretation**
The perioperative period is associated with increased risk of complications in patients with
sickle-cell disease, and observational studies have shown that preoperative blood
transfusion is associated with reduced risk. A randomised trial showed that top-up
transfusions were as eff ective in preventing complications as exchange transfusions when
given preoperatively,[10] but another randomised trial showed no benefi t when preoperative
transfusion was compared with no preoperative transfusion. We found that the use of
preoperative transfusions in patients with the haemoglobin SS sickle-cell-disease subtype
was associated with decreased risk of clinically important and severe complications,
particularly acute chest syndrome.


severe or mild phenotypes. Only fi ve patients had
haemoglobin concentrations of 90 g/L or higher at
baseline, and our fi ndings suggest that preoperative
transfusion will be of most benefi t in patients with low
haemoglobin concen trations. Whether patients with the
haemoglobin SS subtype who present with concentrations
close to 100 g/L will benefi t from preoperative exchange
transfusion is less clear. No benefi t with preoperative
exchange trans fusion has been shown over simple topup transfusion previously, which suggests that the main
benefi t of transfusion in this context is in the correction
of anaemia rather than in the lowering of the percentage
of haemoglobin S.[10]

The number of low-risk operations was too small to
enable subgroup analysis by operation type, and the
results in patients scheduled to undergo low-risk procedures should be interpreted with caution. Previous
observational data in patients who underwent low-risk
operations show opposing results, some showing a
benefi t from preoperative transfusion and some not.[2,16]
Further evidence from randomised trials would,
therefore, be required to fully clarify the extent of benefi t
of preoperative transfusion in patients who undergo lowrisk surgery. Most cases of acute chest syndrome were
seen in patients who underwent medium-risk surgery
without preoperative transfusion, which suggests that
this subgroup would gain the most benefi t.
Observational data suggest that patients with haemoglobin SC and Sβ+thalassaemia sickle-cell-disease
subtypes who undergo low-risk or medium-risk surgery
(particularly abdominal) surgery benefi t from preoperative transfusion.[14] Thus, preoperative transfusions might
be useful in other subgroups of patients with sickle-cell
disease. In this trial only two (3%) patients had the
HbSβ⁰thal genotype and we excluded patients with the
haemoglobin SC and Sβ+thalassaemia subtypes because
of their milder disease phenotypes Therefore it is


diffi cult to apply the conclusions from this trial to
subtypes other than haemoglobin SS. As patients with
the haemoglobin SC subtype constitute up to 30% of all
patients with sickle-cell disease, most of whom generally
do not undergo preoperative transfusion,[3] a further trial
in this popu lation seems warranted.
Recruitment to this study was slower than planned, due
partly to the staggered set-up of study sites, with some
sites only starting recruitment in 2011. Additionally, we
applied stringent inclusion criteria that led to a high rate
of ineligibility among screened patients. Some clinicians
decided not to enter patients, and some patients wished
to avoid transfusion. The possibility of selection bias
cannot be excluded, as only 20% of screened patients
were recruited. Nevertheless, similar proportions of those
who were recruited were scheduled to undergo low-risk
and medium-risk surgery, and the reasons for exclusion
across surgical-risk groups were similar, which implies
no bias was related to this feature. Patients scheduled to
undergo orthopaedic surgery were more likely to be
excluded from the trial by clinicians than those scheduled
to undergo other procedures. Only ten orthopaedic
patients were recruited and, therefore, our results might
not be applicable to these patients in practice.
Perioperative management of patients with sickle-cell
disease is complicated and is infl uenced by many factors
specifi c to individual patients and operations. This study,
however, showed that preoperative trans fusion was
associated with decreased risk of periopera tive complications, especially acute chest syndrome, in patients with
the haemoglobin SS subtype who underwent low-risk or
medium-risk surgery (panel). We suggest, therefore, that
preoperative transfusion to a haemoglobin concentration
of about 100 g/L should be part of the standard
management of these patients.
