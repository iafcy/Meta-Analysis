#### abstract


**background**
The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Patients with Central Sleep
Apnea and Heart Failure trial tested the hypothesis that continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) would improve the survival rate without heart transplantation of patients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.

**methods**
After medical therapy was optimized, 258 patients who had heart failure (mean age

[±SD], 63±10 years; ejection fraction, 24.5±7.7 percent) and central sleep apnea (number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep, 40±16) were randomly assigned to receive CPAP (128 patients) or no CPAP (130 patients) and were followed
for a mean of two years. During follow-up, sleep studies were conducted and measurements of the ejection fraction, exercise capacity, quality of life, and neurohormones
were obtained.

**results**
Three months after undergoing randomization, the CPAP group, as compared with the
control group, had greater reductions in the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypopnea (¡21±16 vs. –2±18 per hour, P<0.001) and in norepinephrine levels (¡1.03±1.84
vs. 0.02±0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009), and greater increases in the mean nocturnal
oxygen saturation (1.6±2.8 percent vs. 0.4±2.5 percent, P<0.001), ejection fraction
(2.2±5.4 percent vs. 0.4±5.3 percent, P=0.02), and the distance walked in six minutes
(20.0±55 vs. ¡0.8±64.8 m, P=0.016). There were no differences between the control
group and the CPAP group in the number of hospitalizations, quality of life, or atrial
natriuretic peptide levels. An early divergence in survival rates without heart transplantation favored the control group, but after 18 months the divergence favored the CPAP
group, yet the overall event rates (death and heart transplantation) did not differ (32 vs.
32 events, respectively; P=0.54).

**conclusions**
Although CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea, improved nocturnal oxygenation, increased the ejection fraction, lowered norepinephrine levels, and increased the distance
walked in six minutes, it did not affect survival. Our data do not support the use of
CPAP to extend life in patients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.

entral sleep apnea, which is present in approximately 25 to 40 percent of pa
# c tients with chronic heart failure,[1-3] results

from cyclic hyperventilation and falls in the partial
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide below the apnea
threshold.[4] The condition affects cardiovascular
function adversely by causing tissue hypoxia, arousals from sleep, and activation of the sympathetic
nervous system, and it independently increases the
risk of death.[1,5,6]

In short-term, single-center randomized trials
lasting one to three months involving small numbers of patients who had central sleep apnea and
chronic heart failure, continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) attenuated the central sleep apnea,
increased the left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF), reduced daytime levels of atrial natriuretic
peptide and plasma norepinephrine, and improved
the patients’ quality of life.[4,7,8] In one trial, among
patients receiving CPAP, there was a trend toward
fewer deaths and heart transplantations.[5] However,
that trial involved only 29 patients and was conducted before there was wide use of beta-blockers
to treat heart failure.
We therefore undertook a multicenter trial to
test the hypothesis that long-term treatment of central sleep apnea with the use of CPAP in patients
who have heart failure and are receiving optimal
medical therapy reduces the combined rates of
death and heart transplantation.[9] During the trial,
we also evaluated the effect of CPAP on the LVEF,
quality of life, submaximal exercise, number of
hospitalizations, and levels of plasma norepinephrine and atrial natriuretic peptide.


#### methods


**study design**
The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
for Patients with Central Sleep Apnea and Heart
Failure (CANPAP) trial was a randomized, openlabel trial in which outcomes were evaluated at 11
centers[9] by investigators blinded to the treatment
assignments. It was supported by a grant from the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) University Industry Program (UI-14909) in partnership
with Respironics, ResMed, and Tyco Healthcare.
The sponsors had no role in the conception or design of the study; the collection, analysis, or interpretation of the data; or the drafting or revision of
the manuscript. The research ethics board of each
institution approved the protocol.[8] Enrollment oc

curred after patients provided written informed
consent.

**patients**
Candidates for participation in the trial included
men and women 18 to 79 years of age who had
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class II through IV heart failure due to ischemic,
hypertensive, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and whose condition had been stabilized by
means of optimal medical therapy for at least one
month; an LVEF of less than 40 percent on radionuclide angiography; and central sleep apnea, defined as 15 or more episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep, more than 50 percent of
which were determined to be central rather than
obstructive. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, myocardial infarction, unstable angina or cardiac surgery within the previous three months,
and obstructive sleep apnea.

**baseline assessment**
Eligible patients underwent clinical assessment followed by overnight polysomnography. Sleep stages
and arousals, episodes of apnea and hypopnea, and
the mean and lowest arterial oxygen saturation levels were assessed according to uniform methods at
all centers.[4,10,11] Respiratory efforts were measured
with the use of respiratory inductance plethysmography, and airflow by nasal pressure.[2,3,6,12-15] Central sleep apnea was defined as the absence of tidal
volume for 10 or more seconds without thoracoabdominal motion,[3,4] and central hypopnea as a reduction of 50 percent or more in tidal volume from
baseline for 10 or more seconds without airflow
limitation, as detected with the measurement of
nasal pressure.[4,12] Apnea and hypopnea were classified as obstructive if there was out-of-phase motion
of the rib cage and abdomen, or if airflow limitation was present.[3,12] The apnea–hypopnea index
was defined as the number of episodes of apnea and
hypopnea per hour of sleep. The diagnosis of central sleep apnea required an apnea–hypopnea index
of 15 or more events per hour, with more than 50
percent of the events determined to be central rather
than obstructive .[2,3]

Resting LVEF on radionuclide angiography, the
distance walked in six minutes,[16] and the quality of
life (assessed with the use of patients’ responses to
the Chronic Heart Failure Questionnaire, which assesses patients’ functioning with regard to dyspnea,
fatigue, emotional functioning, and disease mastery

cpap for central sleep apnea and heart failure


according to a seven-point scale, with lower scores
indicating worse condition)[4,17] were then determined. At three centers, the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide and plasma norepinephrine were
measured between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.

**randomization**
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the
control group, who continued to receive optimal
medical therapy for chronic heart failure,[18] or to
the treatment group, who received CPAP in addition to the medical therapy. Randomization was
performed by a computer-generated schedule in
random blocks of four and six and was stratified
according to study center and brand of CPAP device. Treatment assignment was communicated to
the study centers by the data management center
after verification that the patient met all the eligibility criteria. Patients assigned to CPAP underwent
further randomization in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the
devices (Respironics Remstar Pro, ResMed Sullivan VII, or Tyco Healthcare GoodKnight 420S, respectively). The use of CPAP devices from three
different companies was a consequence of the arrangements made for study funding.

**initiation of cpap**
CPAP was initiated over two to three nights, which
the patients spent in an unmonitored sleep laboratory or a hospital bed,[4,7,8] starting at a pressure
of 5 cm of water the first night, then increasing by
2 to 3 cm of water over the next one or two nights
until reaching a pressure of 10 cm of water (a level
shown to attenuate central sleep apnea)[4,5,7] or the
highest pressure tolerated. Patients were instructed to use CPAP for at least six hours nightly at home
during the trial. If necessary, the pressure was raised
to 10 cm of water or the highest level tolerated at
the follow-up visits at the end of month 1 or month
3. At each follow-up visit, the number of hours during which CPAP was used was downloaded from a
meter that measured the amount of time the mask
was used.

**assessment of outcomes**
Clinical assessments were performed at one, three,
and six months after randomization, and every six
months thereafter. Polysomnography was performed at 3 and 24 months. LVEF, the distance
walked in six minutes, and quality of life were assessed at 3, 6, and 24 months. At three centers,
levels of plasma norepinephrine and atrial natri

uretic peptide were obtained at 3, 6, and 24 months.
Patients were followed from randomization until
death, heart transplantation, or the end of the study.
The time and cause of death or time of heart transplantation were ascertained from medical records
or death certificates and were verified by an endpoint adjudication committee.
To confirm previous evidence that CPAP attenuates central sleep apnea and improves cardiovascular function after three months, we calculated the
changes from baseline in the apnea–hypopnea index, mean and minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation, LVEF, and levels of plasma norepinephrine
and atrial natriuretic peptide at three months and
throughout the remainder of the trial.[4,7,8] The primary outcome was the combined rate of death from
all causes and heart transplantation (the data were
censored as of the date of transplantation). Secondary outcomes included death alone and transplantation-free survival, with censoring of data on
patients who dropped out, the number of hospital
admissions confirmed on the basis of medical records, and changes from baseline in the distance
walked in six minutes and in the quality of life.

**sample size**
The size of the sample for the primary outcome
was calculated with the use of the log-rank test, assuming an annual event rate of 24 percent in the
control group,[5,6,9,15] with a relative hazard ratio
for CPAP of 0.65. At a two-sided alpha level of 0.05,
with 80 percent power, we estimated that 204 patients per group would be required.[19]

**statistical analysis**
Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to visualize
survival without heart transplantation. Cox proportional-hazards analysis was used to compare
transplantation-free survival between groups. The
primary statistical analysis was according to the
intention-to-treat principle. A secondary analysis
of this outcome, with data on those who dropped
out censored as of the dropout date, was also performed. Generalized linear models for binomial
and Poisson distributed outcomes were used to assess changes in the overall event rate over time.[20]

Further analyses with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models examined the effects of interactions between the treatment assignment and
compliance with the treatment, age, NYHA class,
LVEF, cause of heart failure, medications, and bodymass index on the primary outcome. The number

**patients**
Of 727 patients who were screened between December 1998 and May 2004, 345 met the eligibility
criteria, of whom 258 agreed to participate and
underwent randomization: 130 patients were assigned to the control group and 128 to the CPAP
group. Table 1 shows the similarity in baseline
characteristics of the two groups. Ninety-six percent of the patients were men, consistent with the
epidemiology of heart failure in patients of a similar
age[21] and with the predominance of men among
those with heart failure who have central sleep apnea.[3,4,6,15,22,23]

The mean apnea–hypopnea index of 40 per hour
indicates severe central sleep apnea. Although
some misclassification of hypopnea is possible, the
overwhelming predominance of episodes of central apnea and hypopnea makes overlap with mainly obstructive sleep apnea unlikely (Table 1).

cpap for central sleep apnea and heart failure


**compliance and dropout rate**

During the course of the trial, 20 patients in each
group (15.5 percent) dropped out, refusing further
evaluation. In the CPAP group, the average number
of hours of daily use of CPAP varied between 4.3
hours during the first three months to 3.6 hours at
one year and beyond. The CPAP averaged 8 to 9 cm
of water at three months and beyond.

**effect of cpap on central sleep apnea**
**and cardiovascular function**

At three months, the patients assigned to CPAP
had a greater (50 percent) reduction in the apnea–
hypopnea index than those in the control group
(¡21±16 vs. ¡2±18 per hr, P<0.001) (Fig. 1) and
greater increases in mean oxygen saturation
(1.6±2.8 percent vs. 0.4±2.5 percent, P<0.001) and
minimum oxygen saturation (4.7±7.3 percent vs.
0.9±6.0 percent, P<0.001) (Fig. 1). These changes
were sustained throughout the trial. There were no
changes in sleep time, distribution of sleep stages,


or frequency of arousal in either group (P>0.19 for
each variable). At three months, CPAP caused a
greater increase in LVEF (2.2±5.4 percent vs.
0.4±5.3 percent, P=0.02) (Fig. 1) and a greater
reduction in levels of plasma norepinephrine
(¡1.03±1.84 vs. 0.02±0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009)
than did no intervention. These benefits were sustained for up to two years. CPAP had no significant
effect on levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (P=0.64).

**primary outcome**
Collection of follow-up data on patients for the primary end point stopped on May 21, 2004, when the
trial was terminated by the executive committee.
Primary outcome data were obtained for all patients, including dropouts. The mean follow-up interval was 2 years (range, 0 to 64 months). The rate
of the primary event decreased from 20 to 4 per
100 person-years between 1998–1999 and 2004
(P=0.003) (Fig. 2). This falling event rate was associated with a changing pattern of drug therapy.

During the same period, more patients were receiving beta-blockers (a change from 58 percent to 86
percent, P<0.001) and spironolactone (a change
from 14 percent to 41 percent, P=0.001) and fewer
patients were receiving digoxin (a change from 72
percent to 36 percent, P=0.002) at the time of enrollment. The use of beta-blockers and spironolactone also increased between the time of baseline
assessment and the time of the last follow-up visit
for the two groups (beta-blockers, from 77 percent
to 83 percent, P<0.001; and spironolactone, from
34 percent to 51 percent, P=0.04), but between the
groups, the changes did not differ significantly
(P>0.18 for each drug).
During follow-up, there were 28 deaths and
four heart transplantations in the control group
and 27 deaths and five heart transplantations in the
CPAP group. Most of the deaths were due to cardiovascular causes (Table 2). In the proportional-hazards model, there was no difference in transplantation-free survival between the control group and
the CPAP group (hazard ratio for heart transplantation, 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to
1.90; P=0.54) (Fig. 3). However, the hazards appeared to be nonproportional during the follow-up
period (chi-square=10.9, P=0.001). There was a
divergence of event rates in the first 18 months favoring the control group (hazard ratio for an event,
1.5; P=0.02) that was reversed after 18 months to
favor CPAP (hazard ratio for an event, 0.66; P=0.06).


The level of CPAP and the hours of use were not related to the rate of the primary event. There was no
significant interaction between treatment assignment and the seven variables included in the statistical analysis. A post hoc analysis did not detect any
significant difference in the primary event rate
among the three CPAP devices (P=0.31).

**secondary outcomes**
Death rates alone did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients (hazard ratio for
death, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to
1.88; P=0.714). With the use of a time-dependent
covariate to indicate dropout, the analysis of survival
among the patients who did drop out was found
to be worse than among those who did not (hazard ratio for death, 3.8; P<0.001), with 10 events
among the 20 dropouts from the CPAP group and
9 events among the 20 dropouts from the control
group. Neither overall transplantation-free survival
(hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95 percent confidence
interval, 0.78 to 1.4; P=0.778) nor survival during the first 18 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.4;
P=0.10) differed significantly between patients in
the control group and those in the CPAP group who
remained in the trial.
The number of hospitalizations did not differ
significantly between the control group and the
CPAP group (hospitalizations per patient per year,
0.56±0.56 vs. 0.61±0.72; P=0.45). The distance

#### discussion


The CANPAP trial tested the effects of CPAP on
morbidity and mortality among patients with central sleep apnea and chronic heart failure. The trial
addressed two important issues: First, it confirmed
the findings of previous small, short-term trials
that CPAP attenuates central sleep apnea, improves
nocturnal oxygenation and left ventricular systolic
function, and lowers plasma norepinephrine levels,[4,5,7] and it showed that these effects are sustained with long-term therapy. Second, the trial
failed to demonstrate any beneficial influence of
CPAP on transplantation-free survival, number of
hospitalizations, or quality of life. Therefore, although CPAP improved several physiological outcomes, this improvement did not translate into
longer transplantation-free survival. CPAP did result in an increase of 20 m in the distance walked in
six minutes during the first three months of follow-up, but this improvement was not sustained.
CPAP has been shown to improve cardiovascular function in patients with heart failure who have
central sleep apnea only when the treatment reduces the apnea–hypopnea index.[4,5,7,8,22 ] Because
CPAP does not attenuate central sleep apnea in patients with heart failure when the treatment is titrated over one night,[22-24] we mandated a gradual
upward-titration protocol.[4,7,8] This resulted in a
significant reduction in the apnea–hypopnea index,
which was accompanied by an increase in nocturnal oxygen saturation that persisted for at least two
years. Nonetheless, the reduction of 50 percent in
the apnea–hypopnea index was less than had been
achieved in previous trials with the use of similar
upward titration and CPAP pressures,[4] factors that
may have contributed to the lack of a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.
Improvement in daytime LVEF may be due to
several factors, including a reduction in cardiac
sympathetic drive,[7,25,26] left ventricular unloading
resulting from an increase in intrathoracic pres

sure,[27] and reduced myocardial ischemia due to
improvement in oxygen saturation.[28,29] However,
the increase of 2.2 percent in the LVEF was less
than the increase of 7.7 percent observed in our first
randomized trial.[4] We attribute this difference to
the higher initial LVEF (24.5 percent vs. 20.0 percent) and the greater proportion of patients receiving beta-blockers in the present trial (77 percent vs.
<20 percent). Owing to the overlap in the effects of
beta-blockade and CPAP on ventricular function,[30]
the potential for further improvement in the LVEF
when CPAP is added may be limited. The high rate
of use of beta-blockers may also have reduced the
potential for a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.
The early divergence of event rates that initially
favored the control group but favored the CPAP
group after 18 months was not anticipated (Fig. 3).
It suggests that CPAP had an early adverse effect in
some patients. Two possible reasons may be the
effect of the dropouts and improvements in background medical therapy. The early difference in
transplantation-free survival between the control
group and the CPAP group is diminished if it is calculated by excluding the patients who dropped out
(among whom event rates were higher than among
those who did not drop out). Background medical
therapy is of importance, because the acute effect
of CPAP in heart failure is a function of left ventric

ular preload: when filling pressures are high, the
cardiac output increases, and when pressures are
low, it decreases.[31] We cannot exclude the possibility that upward titration of CPAP reduced cardiac
output in some patients with low filling pressures,
owing to more vigorous diuresis or other medical
interventions. If so, a slower CPAP titration might
have avoided some adverse events.
In summary, CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea and improved nocturnal oxygenation, left ventricular function, sympathetic nervous activity, and
(at least initially) submaximal exercise performance. However, the CANPAP trial did not demonstrate a beneficial effect of CPAP on morbidity or
mortality in these patients with central sleep apnea
and heart failure. Because of a declining primary
event rate, which was possibly due in part to concurrent improvements in drug therapy,[32,33] it
would have required a trial three times the size of
ours to determine whether the physiological improvements observed were surrogates for clinically
important outcomes.[19] Although the CANPAP trial
ultimately lacked the power to conclude with certainty that CPAP is ineffective in this patient popu

lation, our data do not support its routine use to
extend life in patients with central sleep apnea and
heart failure. However, this recommendation may
not be applicable to patients with heart failure who
have obstructive sleep apnea, the pathophysiology
of which, arising from pharyngeal occlusion, differs from that of central sleep apnea.[1-3,34-38]

Supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) through its University–Industry Program (UIP). In
accordance with the policy of the UIP, one third of the funding was
provided by the CIHR and two thirds was provided by the industry
partners. Four industry partners each agreed to provide 25 percent
of the industry contribution, including donation of its brand of
CPAP device. One industry partner (Healthdyne) was acquired by another (Respironics), which provided 50 percent of the industry contribution. Supported also by a Senior Scientist Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (to Dr. Bradley); a National
Scientist Award from the Fonds de la Recherche en Santé du Québec
(to Dr. Sériès); and by a Canada Research Chair in Integrative Cardiovascular Biology and a Career Investigator Award from the Heart
and Stroke Foundation of Ontario (to Dr. Floras).
All authors of the manuscript report having received grant support from Respironics, ResMed, and Tyco Healthcare in partnership
with the CIHR for participation in the trial. Dr. Ferguson reports
having received lecture fees from GlaxoSmithKline, Respironics, and
VitalAire; Dr. Pfeifer, grant support from Respironics; Dr. Floras, a
speaking honorarium from Respironics subsequent to public presentation of the CANPAP trial results; and Dr. Hanly reports having
equity ownership in Tyco Healthcare.

**clinical trial registration**

The Journal encourages investigators to register their clinical trials in a public trials
registry. The members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
plan to consider clinical trials for publication only if they have been registered
(see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1). The National Library of Medicine’s
www.clinicaltrials.gov is a free registry, open to all investigators, that meets
the committee’s requirements.
