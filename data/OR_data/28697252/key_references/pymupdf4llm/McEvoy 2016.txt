**BACKGROUND**
Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events;
whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents major
cardiovascular events is uncertain.

**METHODS**
After a 1-week run-in period during which the participants used sham CPAP, we randomly assigned 2717 eligible adults between 45 and 75 years of age who had moderateto-severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary or cerebrovascular disease to receive
CPAP treatment plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (usual-care group).
The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial
infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient
ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, healthrelated quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood.

**RESULTS**
Most of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea
and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP
therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea–hypopnea index (the number of
apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour
at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years,
a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%)
and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10;
95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34). No significant effect on any individual
or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced
snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.

**CONCLUSIONS**
Therapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent
cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and
established cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia and others; SAVE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00738179;

bstructive sleep apnea causes episodic hypoxemia and nocturnal sympathetic nervous system activation[1] and ele
# Ovates blood pressure[2] and markers of oxidative

stress, inflammation, and hypercoagulation.[3,4]
Large negative intrathoracic pressure swings also
impose mechanical stress on the heart and great
vessels.[5-7] Population-based and sleep-clinic–based
cohort studies have shown an association between obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular events,[8-16] particularly stroke.[17] Randomized,
controlled trials have shown that treatment with
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) lowers systolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg in
patients with normotensive obstructive sleep
apnea[18] and by 6 to 7 mm Hg in patients with
resistant hypertension,[19] improves endothelial
function,[20] and increases insulin sensitivity.[21]
Observational clinical studies have shown that
the use of CPAP is associated with lower rates of
cardiovascular complications and of death from
cardiovascular causes, especially among patients
who are adherent to treatment.[10,13]

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condition among patients with cardiovascular disease,
affecting 40 to 60% of such patients.[12,16,22,23] Because the risks of recurrent cardiovascular events
among these patients remain high despite contemporary therapies, CPAP could be a useful additional treatment for the prevention of these
events. We describe the main results of the Sleep
Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study, a
secondary prevention trial that was designed to
evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in reducing
the rate of cardiovascular events among patients
with obstructive sleep apnea.[24]


Methods


**Study Design and Oversight**
The SAVE study was an international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label
trial, with blinded end-point assessment. Details
of the design and analysis plan of the trial have
been published previously.[24,25] An executive committee (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org)
designed the study and supervised the conduct
of the trial and the collection of the data. The
Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health of Flinders
University of South Australia was responsible for


the overall management of the trial and provided
the core sleep laboratory analysis and monitoring of the CPAP data and treatment at the sites.
Investigators at the George Institute for Global
Health coordinated the trial, managed the database, and performed the statistical analyses. All
the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analyses and for the
fidelity of the trial to the protocol, available at
NEJM.org. An independent data and safety monitoring board monitored unblinded trial results
and safety events. The trial protocol was approved
by all appropriate regulatory authorities and
ethics committees at the participating centers. All
participants provided written informed consent.
The National Health and Medical Research
Council of Australia and Philips Respironics
provided the main funding for the trial. In-kind
donations were provided by Respironics for the
CPAP equipment and by ResMed for the sleep
apnea diagnostic devices. None of the funding
agencies contributed to the design of the trial,
the collection or analysis of the data, the writing
of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the
manuscript for publication.

**Patients and Procedures**
Patients were recruited at 89 clinical centers in
7 countries; eligibility criteria included an age
between 45 and 75 years, a diagnosis of coronary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease,
and a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of moderate-tosevere obstructive sleep apnea, which was defined
as an oxygen desaturation index (the number of
times per hour during the oximetry recording
that the blood oxygen saturation level drops by
≥4 percentage points from baseline) of at least
12, was established with the use of a home sleepstudy screening device (ApneaLink, ResMed) and
was confirmed by review of the data at a central
core sleep laboratory. Patients were excluded from
the study if they reported severe daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >15; scores
range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater severity) or were considered to have
an increased risk of an accident from falling
asleep, if they had very severe hypoxemia (oxygen saturation <80% for >10% of recording time),
or if they had a pattern of Cheyne–Stokes respiration on the ApneaLink nasal pressure recording.

Potential participants were required to have a
minimum level of adherence to CPAP therapy,
which was defined as an average of 3 hours per
night, during a 1-week run-in period in which
sham CPAP was used (i.e., CPAP at subtherapeutic pressure). Further details of the inclusion and
exclusion criteria and of the procedures performed at the core sleep laboratory are provided
in the Supplementary Appendix.

**Randomization and Interventions**
After eligibility was confirmed, the patients were
randomly assigned, at a central location, to receive either CPAP therapy plus usual care (CPAP
group) or usual care alone (usual-care group).
Randomization was performed with the use of a
minimization procedure to balance the group
assignments according to site, type of cardiovascular disease (cardiac, cerebrovascular, or both),
and severity of daytime sleepiness (Epworth
Sleepiness Scale score <11 vs. ≥11).
The patients who were assigned to receive
mask-delivered CPAP treatment were provided
with an automated positive airway pressure machine (REMstar Auto, M or PR series, Philips
Respironics) that was initially set in automatic
mode for 1 week and thereafter fixed to the 90th
percentile of pressure that was calculated by the
automated positive airway pressure device from
the recorded data. The core sleep laboratory
monitored trends in adherence to CPAP therapy
and provided corrective advice to investigators
(further details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix). Concomitant management of
cardiovascular risk factors was performed in
accordance with national guidelines. All participants were given advice on healthful sleep habits
and lifestyle changes to minimize obstructive
sleep apnea. Clinic visits were scheduled for all
participants at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annually thereafter; the participants were contacted
by telephone at 6 months between annual clinic
visits.

**Study Measurements**
At randomization and at each follow-up visit,
participants had resting blood pressure and heart
rate measured at the clinic, and details of current medication use and health behaviors were
documented through a structured interview.
Among the participants in the CPAP group, data


on adherence to the use of the CPAP device were
recorded. At randomization, at 6 months, and at
2 and 4 years, anthropometric measurements
were obtained in all participants, and all participants completed several questionnaires: questionnaires that assessed symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (snoring, witnessed episodes of
apnea, and degree of sleepiness according to the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale score), the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey
(SF-36; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher
scores indicating better quality of life) for assessment of health-related quality of life, and the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (on which
anxiety and depression scores range from 0 to 21,
with higher scores indicating more symptoms)
for assessment of mood. Electrocardiography was
performed in all participants at the time of randomization and at 2 years. The European Quality of Life–5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D;
scores range from 1 to 3, with higher scores
indicating more problems across five categories
of quality of life) was administered only at the
end-of-study visit.
The end-of-study visits were conducted from
September 2015 through January 2016 (except
in India, where they were conducted from July
through October 2013). In addition to performing
a regular central review of data quality, research
staff visited the participating sites to monitor and
verify the completeness and authenticity of source
documents and adverse-event reporting. Additional details on study measurements and monitoring procedures are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

**Study End Points**
A committee whose members were unaware of
the study-group assignments adjudicated the
major cardiovascular outcomes specified in the
protocol. The primary end point was a composite
of death from any cardiovascular cause, myocardial infarction (including silent myocardial infarction), stroke, or hospitalization for heart failure, acute coronary syndrome (including unstable
angina), or transient ischemic attack. Prespecified secondary cardiovascular end points included
the individual components of the primary composite end point, other composites of cardiovascular events, revascularization procedures, newonset atrial fibrillation, new-onset diabetes


n engl j med nejm org 3


-----

mellitus, and death from any cause. Other secondary end points included symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea, health-related quality of life,
and mood.
Prespecified safety end points were assessed
each time the participant was contacted; these
end points included all serious adverse events,
self-reported accidents causing personal injury
that occurred while the participant was driving
or while at work, and any accidents or near-miss
accidents that occurred as a result of the participant falling asleep. Two safety end points that
were not prespecified — the number of selfreported road-traffic accidents from any cause
and the number of days off from work because of
poor health — were also assessed. Descriptions
of the study end points and of the procedures
used by the data and safety monitoring board
and end-point adjudicators are provided in the
Supplementary Appendix.

**Statistical Analysis**
Our original plan was to recruit 5000 patients.
In 2012, challenges in achieving recruitment targets prompted us to review the accumulated
blinded study data and an updated meta-regression of studies of cardiovascular events and severity of obstructive sleep apnea. The meta-regression showed that cardiovascular risk increased
by 25 to 32% for every increase of 10 events per
hour in the apnea–hypopnea index (the number
of occurrences of apnea or hypopnea per hour of
sleep), which was a stronger relationship than
we had originally assumed.[24] In consideration of
this information, together with interim blinded
trial data showing an annual event rate of 6.86%
and better-than-expected adherence to CPAP therapy, we revised our sample size to 2500 patients;
we estimated that with this sample size, the study
would have 90% statistical power (at an alpha level
of 0.05) to detect a 25% lower incidence with
CPAP plus usual care than with usual care alone
of the primary composite cardiovascular end point,
which was anticipated to occur in 533 patients
overall over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years.
The primary analysis was an unadjusted survival analysis performed according to the intention-to-treat principle with the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling that was
based on positively adjudicated events. We performed a series of sensitivity analyses, including
an analysis with adjustment for stratification


variables, region, and severity of obstructive sleep
apnea; an analysis with Poisson regression to
account for participants with multiple events;
and an analysis that included all events that were
reported by the investigators and not just those
that were positively adjudicated. To estimate the
effect in patients who were adherent to CPAP
therapy, which was defined as an average of
4 hours or more of treatment per night over the
first 2 years, we used prespecified propensityscore matching to match adherent patients oneto-one with participants selected from the usualcare (control) group who never used CPAP. The
change in clinical variables from baseline to 48
months or to the end-of-study visit (whichever
came first) was assessed with the use of analysis
of covariance with adjustment for baseline values.
All P values are two-sided and were not adjusted
for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were
performed with the use of SAS software, version
9.3 (SAS Institute). (Additional details regarding
the sample-size calculations and other aspects
of the statistical analysis are provided in the
Supplementary Appendix.)


**Study Participants**
A total of 15,325 patients were assessed for eligibility; 5844 met the initial eligibility criteria and
underwent ApneaLink testing, and 3246 entered
the 1-week run-in phase (Fig. 1). The 2717 patients
who were eligible for participation after the runin phase were enrolled in the study from December 2008 through November 2013 and were randomly assigned to receive CPAP plus usual care
(1359 patients) or usual care alone (1358 patients).
All 21 participants from one site were excluded from the study because it was determined
during site monitoring that the required standard for conducting clinical trials was not met;
in addition, 9 other participants withdrew consent at the time of randomization or did not adhere to the trial protocol from the time of randomization. Thus, 2687 participants were included
in the primary analysis (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The
mean age of the participants was 61 years, and
81% were men. The mean body-mass index (the
weight in kilograms divided by the square of
the height in meters) of the participants was 29;
the mean oxygen desaturation index, 28 events
per hour; and the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale

score, 7.4. Participants were evenly divided between those with coronary artery disease and
those with cerebrovascular disease.
Final follow-up visits were completed by January 2016; a total of 147 patients discontinued
their participation in the study before the intended
final visit, but their data up to the time of withdrawal were included in the primary analysis
performed in the intention-to-treat population
(Fig. 1). The mean duration of follow-up was
3.7 years. (Further details on the study participants are provided in Tables S1, S2, and S3 in
the Supplementary Appendix.)

**Intervention Adherence, Medications,**
**and Lifestyle Factors**
The mean duration of use of the sham CPAP
device during the 1-week run-in phase was 5.2
hours per night (Table 1). Among the participants
in the CPAP group, the mean (±SD) duration of
adherence to CPAP therapy in the first month of
treatment was 4.4±2.2 hours per night, which decreased to 3.5±2.4 hours per night by 12 months
and remained relatively stable thereafter (mean
adherence during follow-up, 3.3±2.3 hours). The
residual apnea–hypopnea index during CPAP
use, as measured by the CPAP machine, averaged
3.7 events per hour, which indicated good control of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP. Of the
1346 patients in the CPAP group, 566 (42%) had
good adherence to treatment (≥4 hours per night)
during follow-up. Of the 1341 patients who were
followed in the usual-care group, 90 (6.7%) tried
CPAP but only 57 (4.3%) continued the treatment.
No significant differences were observed between the CPAP group and the usual-care group
in the use of medications for diabetes mellitus
and cardiovascular conditions, in lifestyle factors
including diet and smoking, and in body-mass
index from baseline to the end of the study.
(Further details are provided in Fig. S1 and Tables
S4 through S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.)

**Primary End Point**
A primary end-point event was confirmed in 436
participants — 229 (17.0%) in the CPAP group
and 207 (15.4%) in the usual-care group (hazard
ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval

[CI], 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34) (Table 2 and Fig. 2).
No significant effect of CPAP was found in the
adjusted analysis or in the analyses that were


based on total event rates and on primary endpoint events reported by the investigators. No
significant heterogeneity was observed for the
primary end point across subgroups defined according to region (China vs. outside China), age
group (>60 years vs. ≤60 years), sex, severity of
obstructive sleep apnea, body-mass index (<30 vs.
≥30), daytime sleepiness, type of cardiovascular
disease, and presence or absence of diabetes
mellitus.
Anthropometric and disease characteristics
of patients with good adherence to CPAP therapy
(≥4 hours per night) differed from those of patients with lower adherence and from the patients
in the usual-care group as a whole. One-to-one
propensity-score matching was performed to compare 561 patients who were adherent to CPAP
therapy with 561 patients in the usual-care group.
Among these propensity-score–matched patients,
184 primary end-point events occurred — 86
(15.3%) in the CPAP group and 98 (17.5%) in the
usual-care group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI,
0.60 to 1.07; P = 0.13). The adjusted Cox regression model (adjusted for the baseline factors used
in the propensity-score–matching comparison)
that compared patients with good adherence and
those with poor adherence in the CPAP group
with the patients in the usual-care group showed
a similar result. (Further details on the results
for the primary end point are provided in Tables
S7 through S12 and Figs. S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix.)

**Secondary and Other End Points**
No significant between-group differences were
observed in any of the cause-specific or composite secondary cardiovascular end points in the
primary analysis (Table 2) or in the subsidiary
analyses, except for a higher rate of total hospital
admissions for transient ischemic attack among
the patients in the CPAP group (relative risk,
2.29; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.99; P = 0.04). The propensity score–matched analyses showed that the
patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy had
a lower risk of stroke than those in the usualcare group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32 to
1.00; P = 0.05), as well as a lower risk of the
nonprespecified composite end point of cerebral
events (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.90;
P = 0.02), but these results were not adjusted for
multiple testing. A post hoc CPAP dose–response

The reductions from baseline in sleepiness and
other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea were
greater in the CPAP group than in the usual-care
group (estimated mean between-group difference
in the change from baseline in Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, −2.5; 95% CI, −2.8 to −2.2;
P<0.001) (Table 3). Greater reductions from
baseline in the anxiety and depression subscale
scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale were also observed in the CPAP group
than in the usual-care group (Table 3), and the


percentage of patients with clinically relevant
depression scores was 25 to 30% lower in the
CPAP group than in the usual-care group at the
end of follow-up. The CPAP group had greater
improvement in scores on the physical and
mental subscales of the SF-36 than the usualcare group (Table 3), as well as fewer days off
from work because of poor health (a nonprespecified end point) than the usual-care group
(Table 4). The number of serious adverse events
and the rate of road-traffic accidents and accidents causing injury did not differ significantly
between the two groups (Table 4). (Further details on the results for the secondary and other

Discussion


This secondary prevention trial in adults with
cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea
showed that the risk of serious cardiovascular
events was not lower among patients who received treatment with CPAP in addition to usual
care than among those who received usual care
alone. Treatment with CPAP was associated with
a greater reduction in symptoms of daytime
sleepiness and with improved health-related quality of life, mood, and attendance at work. This
study was not powered to provide definitive answers regarding the effects of CPAP on secondary cardiovascular end points, but there was no
indication of a significant benefit with respect
to any cause-specific cardiovascular outcome.
Three other randomized trials have investigated the effect of CPAP on cardiovascular end
points in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.[26-28] Two studies — a multicenter study conducted in Spain that compared CPAP with usual
care in 725 patients with obstructive sleep apnea
who did not have prior cardiovascular disease[26]
and a single-center study involving 224 patients
with obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery
disease who had just undergone revascularization[28] — showed no difference in composite
cardiovascular end points over several years of
follow-up, although in adjusted analyses, both
studies reported better outcomes among patients
who were adherent to CPAP therapy (≥4 hours
per night) than among patients who did not receive CPAP or who used CPAP less than 4 hours
per night. The third study involving 140 patients
with recent ischemic stroke showed no effect of
CPAP on event-free survival over 2 years.[27]

One important potential limitation of our
trial is that, for several of the participating countries, the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea
were not well established in clinical practice when
the trial began. However, before trial recruitment,
we expended substantial time and effort in conducting training workshops for investigators and
study coordinators. In addition, extensive site
monitoring was conducted throughout the trial
to ensure a high standard of study conduct.


Participants in the SAVE study who were assigned to CPAP adhered to the treatment for a
mean of 3.3 hours per night over several years,
which is similar to the mean adherence in other
reports of CPAP use in patients who had no or
minimal daytime sleepiness[29,30] and which is
consistent with CPAP use in clinical practice.[31]
However, although this overall level of adherence to CPAP therapy exceeded the estimates in
our power calculations, it may still have been
insufficient to provide the level of effect on cardiovascular outcomes that had been hypothesized. For practical reasons and to ensure efficient recruitment and consistency of data across
multiple sites, we used a simple screening device
(ApneaLink) that was based on oximetry and
nasal pressure recordings and used automated
algorithms to analyze signals, rather than the
conventional standard test for obstructive sleep
apnea in which polysomnographic data from an
overnight stay in a hospital or clinic are scored
manually. The ApneaLink screening device has
been shown to be a reliable method for diagnosing
moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.[32,33] To
mitigate the risk of recruiting patients with pre

- Poisson regression was used to calculate the rate ratio between the CPAP group and the usual-care group.
† The chi-square test was used to compare the difference in the proportions of participants experiencing a serious adverse event.
‡ The end points of road-traffic accidents and days off from work because of poor health were not prespecified.
§ The participants were asked whether they had had an episode of falling asleep while driving or working that resulted in an accident or near
miss accident since their last review. The number of such events was not recorded.

- The annual rate is given as the number of days off from work because of poor health per 100 participants in 1 year.


dominantly central apnea rather than obstructive sleep apnea, we excluded patients with overt
heart failure and patients in whom the nasal
pressure signals showed a predominant pattern
of Cheyne–Stokes respiration.
In conclusion, in a large group of adults with
both cardiovascular disease and moderate-tosevere obstructive sleep apnea, the use of CPAP
therapy had no significant effect on the prevention of recurrent serious cardiovascular events,
despite significantly reduced sleepiness and other
symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and improved quality-of-life measures.
