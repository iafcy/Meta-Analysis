**Study Objective: To determine the neurocognitive effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on patients with obstructive sleep**
apnea (OSA).
**Design, Setting, and Participants: The Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES) was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind,**
2-arm, sham-controlled, multicenter trial conducted at 5 U.S. university, hospital, or private practices. Of 1,516 participants enrolled, 1,105 were
randomized, and 1,098 participants diagnosed with OSA contributed to the analysis of the primary outcome measures.
**Intervention: Active or sham CPAP**
**Measurements: Three neurocognitive variables, each representing a neurocognitive domain: Pathfinder Number Test-Total Time (attention and**
psychomotor function [A/P]), Buschke Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall (learning and memory [L/M]), and Sustained Working Memory TestOverall Mid-Day Score (executive and frontal-lobe function [E/F])
**Results: The primary neurocognitive analyses showed a difference between groups for only the E/F variable at the 2 month CPAP visit, but no dif-**
ference at the 6 month CPAP visit or for the A/P or L/M variables at either the 2 or 6 month visits. When stratified by measures of OSA severity (AHI
or oxygen saturation parameters), the primary E/F variable and one secondary E/F neurocognitive variable revealed transient differences between
study arms for those with the most severe OSA. Participants in the active CPAP group had a significantly greater ability to remain awake whether
measured subjectively by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale or objectively by the maintenance of wakefulness test.
**Conclusions: CPAP treatment improved both subjectively and objectively measured sleepiness, especially in individuals with severe OSA (AHI >**
30). CPAP use resulted in mild, transient improvement in the most sensitive measures of executive and frontal-lobe function for those with severe
disease, which suggests the existence of a complex OSA-neurocognitive relationship.

**INTRODUCTION**
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related
breathing disorder estimated to affect more than 14 million
Americans[1]; comprehensive data are lacking on the impact of
OSA on the neurocognitive domains of attention and psychomotor function, learning and memory, and executive and frontal-lobe function. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
therapy is in widespread use,[2] yet its efficacy in providing significant long-term neurocognitive and other functional benefits
to OSA patients has not been systematically investigated. The

National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-supported
Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES)
is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, sham-controlled, multicenter, long-term (6 months) trial of CPAP therapy, designed
to provide adequate statistical power to assess its efficacy on
neurocognitive function in patients with OSA across a range of
disease severity.

**METHODS**

**Participants**
APPLES was conducted at 5 Clinical Centers: Stanford University, Stanford, CA; University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; Providence St. Mary Medical Center, Walla Walla, WA; St. Luke’s
Hospital, Chesterfield, MO; and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA. The protocol[3] was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) at each site; the first participant was enrolled
in 11/2003 and the final completion month was 8/2008.
The inclusion criteria[3] were a diagnosis of OSA[4] with an

CPAP or surgery; (2) anyone in the household with current/past
CPAP use; (3) sleepiness-related automobile accident within
past year; (4) oxygen saturation < 75% for > 10% of the diagnostic polysomnogram (PSG) total sleep time; and/or (5) conditions (including known neurocognitive impairment), disorders,
medications, or substances that could potentially affect neurocognitive function and/or alertness.

**Study Design**
Sample size[3] was calculated to permit detection of treatment
effects at least as large as those estimated from two pilot studies,
with 90% power and a type I error rate of 5%. In the pilot studies,
the Pathfinder Number Test had the smallest estimated effect size
of 0.2, which translates to a difference of 26 msec in reaction time
between the Active and Sham CPAP groups. Allowing for 3 interim analyses and 20% dropout,[5,6] this effect size provided a randomization target of 1,100 participants (Appendix Section 1A).
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) used a computerized
permuted block design[3] to randomize 1,105 participants to active vs. sham CPAP (REMstar Pro, Philips Respironics, Inc.)
devices; the sham CPAP device closely simulates the airflow
through the exhalation port and the operating noise of the active CPAP device.[7] Randomization was stratified by gender,
race (white vs. non-white), and OSA severity (mild, 10.0-15.0
respiratory events per hour of sleep; moderate, 15.1-30.0; severe, > 30; using American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task
Force [1999] OSA diagnostic criteria).[4] A biased coin (7:3) was
implemented for blocks of 30 when the difference in percentage randomized to active vs. sham at a given site was > 7%.
Participants and most personnel were blinded[3] to treatment assignments, with the exception of site coordinators, PSG technologists, and the database administrator/data manager.
Participants were studied up to 6 months over 11 visits (Figure 1) and were compensated up to $500 for study completion.
All data from sites were linked to a unique subject code and
were securely transferred and archived by the DCC using a
custom-designed Internet-based data management system that
facilitated extensive quality control procedures.[3]

CPAP adherence[3] was objectively assessed using Encore Pro
SmartCard (Philips Respironics, Inc.) data. Site staff contacted
participants twice within the first week after starting CPAP to
ensure use and manage any problems, and regularly thereafter
to discuss CPAP nonadherence (< 4 h of use/night).

**Efficacy and Safety Evaluations**
The primary outcomes[3] were 3 neurocognitive variables,
each representing a neurocognitive domain: (1) Pathfinder
Number Test-Total Time (PFN-TOTL) assesses attention and
psychomotor function (A/P), and comprises the total time for
the participant to scan, locate, and connect numbers in sequence
(computer analog of Trail Making Test Part A); (2) Buschke
Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall (BSRT-SR)[8] assesses
verbal learning and memory (L/M), and consists of the total
words recalled across 6 selective reminding trials; and (3) Sustained Working Memory Test-Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMTOMD)[9] assesses an executive and frontal-lobe function (E/F)
component by requiring the participant to compare the spatial

same as that on the previous trial or a second button if it differed. For SWMT-OMD, a behavioral (task performance) and
2 electroencephalographic (task-related EEG [cortical activation] and resting EEG [alertness]) subindices are combined to
yield an overall index indicating the degree of change from
pre-treatment baseline for the midday test administration.[9] The
secondary outcomes[3] were 7 neurocognitive and 2 sleepiness
measures, the maintenance of wakefulness test (an objective
test to assess participants’ ability to remain awake) and the
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (a questionnaire to assess subjective
daytime sleepiness).
Each site had a blinded physician observer who assessed participant safety[3] throughout the study. The DCC monitored and
reported safety data to the IRBs and Data and Safety Monitoring
Board (DSMB). Stopping rules[3] were developed for early efficacy[10] in addition to safety (cardiovascular disease [CVD] and motor vehicle accidents [MVAs]); data were presented by blinded
arm to the DSMB at each interim analysis (25%, 50%, and 75%).

**Statistical Analyses**
The protocol-specified primary comparison was the difference between slopes (active vs. sham) across time, but generalized estimating equations (GEE)[11] could only be applied to one
of the 3 primary outcomes (PFN-TOTL), due to: (1) an inadvertent difference in difficulty of the BSRT-SR form versions
between baseline and subsequent administrations and (2) the
SWMT-OMD provided as a change from baseline score (Appendix Section 1B). Therefore, after review of the GEE results,
it was decided that generalized linear models (GLM) for byvisit comparisons, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)
for repeated measures data, or parametric survival analyses
for right-censored data be used to fit the primary outcomes for
comparing means between study arms (Appendix Section 2B).
Analyses for all 3 main outcomes were done with and without
adjustment for baseline covariates. Post hoc CPAP adherenceadjusted and retention-adjusted primary outcome analyses are
described in Appendix Sections 7-8. Post hoc primary outcome
analyses were also performed restricted to CPAP-adherent individuals using the same methods described above (Appendix
Section 7). Post hoc oxygen saturation analyses used GLM;
sleepiness analyses used 2-sample t-tests or Spearman correlation coefficients (Appendix Section 2E-2G).
Comparison of AHI means between study arms by visits
used 2-sample t-tests after Box-Cox transformation. CPAP
adherence was analyzed as an outcome using a KolmogorovSmirnov 2-sample test,[12] _χ[2] test, or permutation test (Appen-_
dix Sections 5A-5C). Agreement between blinded participant
guesses and actual treatment assignment was estimated by a
κ coefficient (Appendix Section 5D). Associations between
sleepiness and CPAP adherence used Spearman correlation coefficients (Appendix Section 4A). Retention was analyzed as
an outcome using a life-table method (Appendix Section 6A).
Following an a priori analysis plan, 7 secondary outcome
neurocognitive variables were selected from an initial set of 12
via independent component analysis (ICA).[13] GLM or GLMM
was used to regress each secondary outcome on study arm with
adjustment for covariates (Appendix Section 3). Maintenance

yses for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale used GLM for an overdispersed binomial distribution. Safety analyses used GLM.
The DCC conducted all analyses (using SAS[15] and R[16]). Hypothesis testing was 2-tailed at a type I error rate of 3.07% for
the primary neurocognitive analyses (due to interim tests) and a
5% type I error rate for the remaining analyses. Intention-to-treat
parameters, verification of model assumptions, and treatment of
missing data are described in the Appendix Sections 1C-1E.

**RESULTS**

**Baseline**
Of 1,516 participants enrolled, 1,105 were randomized.
Three participants had an AHI < 10 (following PSG quality
control), and 4 had inadvertent exposure to both treatment conditions. They were excluded from analyses, resulting in 1,098
randomized participants (556 active, 542 sham; Figure 1).
Baseline participant characteristics revealed an obese, predominantly white, male, highly educated sample, and the sleep study
data are consistent with those of untreated OSA patients; further
characteristics are discussed in a separate publication on the
baseline analyses conducted for this study.[17] Baseline data were
similar between arms (Table 1); the only difference detected
was that active participants were 1.4 years older on average.

**Efficacy**

**_Primary Neurocognitive Outcomes_**
For protocol-specified GEE analyses, no difference in
slopes over time was detected for PFN-TOTL between arms
(P = 0.8663) (Appendix Section 2A). Comparison of means
(regression estimates) between arms revealed a difference for
SWMT-OMD at the 2 month (2M) CPAP visit (active 0.035,
sham -0.074, P = 0.0074; Table 2). No differences in means were
detected between arms for SWMT-OMD at the 6 month (6M)
CPAP visit, or for PFN-TOTL and BSRT-SR at either visit.

**_Effects of CPAP Adherence and Retention on Primary Outcome_**
**_Analyses_**
CPAP adherence data (Appendix Section 5) for the participants’ entire follow-up duration revealed a difference in mean
nightly CPAP usage between arms (active 4.2, sham 3.4 h,
P < 0.001). Adherence was also analyzed for various durations
(night, week, month, and 2 months) prior to the 2M and 6M
visits; differences in means were detected between arms for all
durations at both visits (e.g., week prior to 2M and 6M: active
5.1, sham 4.1 h, P < 0.0001). Active participants adhered more
by a standard criterion (≥ 4 h for > 70% of the nights) for all
durations prior to both visits. A total of 55.3% of active participants correctly guessed their treatment assignment vs. 69.7% of
sham participants (κ = 0.25, P < 0.0001). Participant retention
at 6M differed between arms (active 79.7%, sham 74.4%, logrank P = 0.0363; Appendix Section 6). Based on these findings,
primary outcomes were adjusted for adherence and retention.
When primary neurocognitive analyses were restricted to
CPAP-adherent individuals (mean nightly active or sham CPAP
adherence ≥ 4 h for the 2 months prior to each neurocognitive


y p y y (
OMD, estimated active mean minus sham mean = 0.088,
P = 0.0892; Appendix Section 7). Restriction to the adherent
population resulted in a smaller sample size (2M n = 511, 6M
n = 413) and an imbalance for one baseline feature (mean IQ
Verbal WASI was 2.5 units higher for sham than active at 6M,
P = 0.0453) that was not present in the full population; however,
the imbalance on baseline age that existed in the full population
(Table 1) was not detectable in this subgroup (P ≥ 0.1366).
An analysis comparing baseline variables for the group of adherent individuals vs. non- adherent individuals at both the 2M
and 6M time points revealed significant differences in a number
of baseline variables. Adherent individuals were older on average (2M 4.8 y older, P < 0.0001; 6M 5.4 y older, P < 0.0001),
were more likely to be white (2M/6M P < 0.0001) and married
(2M P = 0.0474, 6M P = 0.0161), and also had higher WASI IQ
scores on average (e.g., IQFull4WASI: 2M 5.1 points higher,
6M 4.5 points higher, P < 0.0001). Some differences in baseline polysomnographic variables also emerged. On average, the
group of CPAP-adherent individuals at 2M and 6M had a lower
sleep efficiency percentage at baseline (2M 1.9% lower, P =
0.0296; 6M 3.8% lower, P < 0.0001); and at 6M, adherers had a
shorter total sleep time (15 min lower, P = 0.0011), longer sleep
latency (4.2 min higher, P = 0.0063), longer REM latency (5.4
min higher, P = 0.0221), and a lower percentage of stage 3 sleep
(0.67% lower, P = 0.0424).
We also performed analyses that adjusted for the confounding that could arise because participants selected their levels
of adherence. Results for the primary outcomes remained unchanged when compared at each of 9 different levels of mean
adherence (0, 1, 2, …, 8 hours per night), with adjustment for
possible confounding using generalized propensity scores.
These adjusted analyses detected a difference in means between
arms for SWMT-OMD at 2M for 3 and 4 h of mean adherence
per night (P ≤ 0.044, Appendix Section 7).
Retention-adjusted primary outcome analyses (Appendix
Section 8) revealed the tendency to discontinue (drop or disqualification) from the study was associated with neurocognitive change from baseline for the 2M/6M BSRT-SR and for the
6M SWMT-OMD (P ≤ 0.0075); however, adjusting for these
associations did not alter detection of treatment effects.

**_Effects of AHI, Oxygen Saturation, and Sleepiness on Primary_**
**_Outcome Analyses_**
A significant difference was detected in AHI between active
vs. sham CPAP groups at 2M (P < 0.0001) and 6M (P < 0.0001);
no difference in AHI was detected between groups at baseline.
Covariate-adjusted regression analyses detected a difference between arms in the 2M SWMT-OMD for only those participants
with severe OSA at baseline (P = 0.0031) (Table 2). Additional
analyses revealed that the only significant change in means
between the 2M and 6M visits for the SWMT-OMD was for
participants with severe OSA in the sham group (sham -0.150,
P = 0.0132; Appendix Section 2D).
To assess whether baseline oxygen saturation may be correlated with the neurocognitive response to CPAP,[18] post hoc mean
comparisons were made between the lower three %TSTO2 < 85
quartiles vs. the upper quartile separately by visit and arm. For the

**Figure 1—Participant flow diagram. Study visits included: (1) Clinical Evaluation (CE) included informed consent, baseline testing and screening, and a**
medical examination by a study physician; (2) Training Sessions 1 and 2 (TS) consisted of neurocognitive test training, screening, and administration of
psychological tests; (3) Diagnostic Polysomnography (PSG) Visit (DX PSG Visit) involved an overnight diagnostic sleep study, questionnaires, maintenance
of wakefulness test (MWT), and the neurocognitive test battery; (4) CPAP Titration Visit (CT) included administration of questionnaires and an overnight CPAP
titration PSG study conducted for both active and sham CPAP group participants to determine the optimal CPAP pressure for those in the active CPAP group;
(5) CPAP Set-up Visit provided the participant with the active or sham CPAP device following the CPAP titration visit; (6) Two Month Post-CPAP Follow-Up
Visit (2M CPAP Visit) represented a follow-up overnight CPAP titration PSG study, with questionnaires, psychological tests, MWT, and neurocognitive test
battery; (7) Four Month Post-CPAP Follow-Up Visit (4M CPAP Visit) consisted of questionnaires and a follow-up appointment with a study physician that
included a physical examination and discussion of CPAP adherence, protocol compliance, safety issues, and medication changes; (8) Six Month Post-CPAP
Follow-Up Visit (6M CPAP Visit) used the same protocol as the 2M-CPAP Visit; (9) Additional Follow-Up Visit allowed the participant to discuss any issues
or problems; (10) Exit Interview gave the participant an opportunity to initiate other OSA treatment options.

quartiles (0.132 vs. 0.003, P = 0.0448; Appendix
Section 2E) compared to baseline after 2 months
on active CPAP. SWMT-OMD differences between quartiles were not detectable in 6M active
participants or in 2M or 6M sham participants.
Active participants were significantly more
alert than sham participants for the maintenance of wakefulness test-mean sleep latency
(MWT-MSL) and Epworth Sleepiness ScaleTotal Score (ESS-TS) at both visits (Table 3).
Relative to sham, mean MWT-MSL scores only
improved for those active participants with severe OSA (2M P = 0.0002; 6M P = 0.0002), and
mean ESS-TS scores only improved for those
active participants with moderate and severe
OSA at each visit (2M P = 0.0236, P = 0.0005;
6M P = 0.0106, P = 0.0010). For active participants, greater CPAP adherence was associated
with greater subjective alertness (ESS-TS; Appendix Section 4A). For subjectively sleepy
participants (baseline ESS-TS > 10), average
change from baseline differed between arms for
6M SWMT-OMD (active 0.150, sham 0.014,
P = 0.0433; Appendix Section 2F) but not for
2M SWMT-OMD or the other primary outcomes at 2M or 6M. No differences between
arms in mean change from baseline were observed for objectively sleepy participants (baseline MWT-MSL ≤ 14.5); but for this subgroup, a
mild correlation between changes from baseline
for the MWT-MSL and the 2M SWMT-OMD
was detected in the active group (SCC = 0.2084,
P = 0.0395; Appendix Section 2G).

showed short-term improvement in the active
arm at the 2M visit for the primary E/F variable. These results suggest disease severity
may be important for detecting improvement
in neurocognitive outcomes. As measures of
disease severity, both AHI[30,36] and oxygen
saturation have been previously implicated
in the etiology of the OSA-associated neurocognitive dysfunction. Although some studies on OSA[36] and hypoxemic patients[37] failed
to find a relationship between measures of
oxygen saturation and neurocognitive function, others,[38] including the large-scale Sleep
Heart Health Study,[18] reported that OSA
patients with decreased oxygen saturation
were more cognitively impaired compared to
those without significant desaturations. Additionally, baseline analyses of the APPLES
population found that severity of oxygen desaturation was weakly associated with worse
neurocognitive performance on some measures of intelligence, attention, and processing speed.[17]

close follow-up to troubleshoot and encourage adherence in our
participants. A majority of sham participants correctly guessed
their treatment assignment. These factors collectively may have
resulted in a sample with relatively lower susceptibility to the
neurocognitive effects of OSA and a subsequent reduced response to treatment.
In summary, active CPAP improved the primary measure of
E/F at 2 months, and for those participants with severe OSA,
improved both the primary and two secondary measures of
E/F at the same time point of the study. There is evidence that
deficits in neurobehavioral function vary significantly between
individuals, are stable within individuals, and may involve a
trait-like vulnerability to impairment from sleep loss.[43] The
cognitive reserve theory may also be relevant for our findings;
individual differences in how the brain processes tasks may allow some to cope with greater insult by using preexisting cognitive processes or by enlisting compensatory processes before
performance is detrimentally impacted.[44] While it is possible
that our intelligent population (WASI IQ) may have had less
neurocognitive impairment due to OSA because they had more
cognitive reserve, resulting in their ability to maintain performance, adjusting for WASI IQ in the models did not change the
results. It is also possible that the lengthy list of baseline covariates we tested is not properly aligned with more complex neurocognitive traits; perhaps neurocognitive testing incorporating
advanced electroencephalographic and imaging technology
will be necessary to identify potential changes in neurocognitive outcomes in OSA patients. We believe this study supports
the theory that OSA is a multifaceted disorder with many comorbidities and outcomes; we believe that the mixed results
from prior studies and the limited effect of CPAP on E/F measures of neurocognition in this study suggest the existence of a
complex OSA-neurocognitive relationship, and that clinicians
should consider disease severity, sleepiness, and individual differences including treatment adherence in managing their patients with CPAP.

**SECTION 1. APPLES STUDY DESIGN**

**1A. Sample Size Calculations**
Two pilot studies[1] were completed at Stanford University
with a total of 16 participants (14 men and 2 women, aged 2865 years). Eight participants were assigned, in random order,
to active CPAP and 8 to sham CPAP. These pilot studies demonstrated the feasibility of the methods that were employed in
APPLES and provided preliminary data used in our sample size
calculations.
Sample size was calculated to permit detection of treatment
effects at least as large as those estimated from the two pilot
studies (n = 16) with 90% power and a type I error rate of 5%.
The APPLES sample size was based on pilot study results for
the Pathfinder Number Test because this test required the largest
sample size (Table S1) among the 3 primary outcome measures.
Allowing for 3 interim analyses and a 20% dropout (estimated
based on our clinical research experience and 2 studies measuring long-term CPAP adherence)[2,3] resulted in a randomization
target of 1,100 total participants.
The following are additional justifications as to why 1,100
participants are necessary for this study (from APPLES Proto_col Section 6.6):_
_1. Large sample sizes are needed for neurocognitive out-_
_comes in CPAP-treated OSA subjects._
Although the effect sizes for impairment in various cognitive domains reported by Engleman and colleagues[4]
ranged from ≤ 0.3 to > 3.0, most studies found effect
sizes < 0.3. Although the sum of the two pilot studies
consisted of a limited sample size of eight subjects in
each treatment arm, we found a range of effect sizes
(0.20 to 2.46) similar to those found by Engleman and
colleagues in their review. Smaller effect sizes require
larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance.
We estimate an effect size of 0.2 for the Pathfinder
Number Test. The effect size of 0.2 translates to the
clinically significant difference of 26 msec in reaction
time between the Active and Sham CPAP groups for this
test. An effect size ≥ 0.2 also translates to clinically significant differences between the groups for the other two
primary outcome measures.
_2. We are examining neurocognitive outcomes in response_


The effect sizes previously reported were typically related to patients with a limited severity range of OSA;
the more severe the case of OSA, the greater the neurocognitive impairment.[5,6] Since our study will include
subjects varying over the entire range of OSA severity,
we need a larger sample size than would be indicated by
the prior studies.
_3. Prior studies had small sample sizes and showed con-_
_flicting results._
The majority of case-control or randomized controlled
studies evaluating neurocognitive function and OSA
had sample sizes < 50 OSA subjects. The conflicting
results of these studies could be due to the following:
a) low sample sizes, b) tests in any one study did not
cover a range of neurocognitive domains, and c) lack of
multiple measures within each neurocognitive domain.
Our study will avoid these methodological limitations
through a large sample size and multiple measures within several neurocognitive domains.
_4. Secondary neurocognitive outcome measures will also_
_be explored._
Based on prior smaller studies, CPAP treatment was
shown to improve various domains of neurocognitive
function in a clinically important way. Treatments will
be compared statistically for these secondary neurocognitive outcome measures.

**_Pilot Studies – Results (from APPLES Protocol Section 3.3.2)_**
The main results from the pilot studies are summarized
in Table S1. There was a wide variability in the therapeutic
effect sizes for changes in neurocognitive function, ranging
from small (0.01) to large (1.32). For the SWMT, we focused our analysis on the third test interval, which occurred
at 2:30 pm. The effect of active vs. sham CPAP therapy was
examined for a number of behavioral and EEG variables independently. A summary behavioral measure from the task
improved in the active CPAP group whereas the sham group
showed a small decrease on the same measure, resulting in
a treatment effect size of 0.62 (P = 0.38). Similarly, the active CPAP group showed a decrease in an electrophysiologic
variable associated with drowsiness, whereas the sham group
showed an increase in the same variable, resulting in a treat

behavioral variables in isolation, we also used a composite index. This index can serve as a summary measure for the degree
of change in each patient following treatment. The index was
weighted so that positive index values reflect relatively greater
alertness in the post-treatment condition, negative values reflect
relatively lower post-treatment alertness and zero reflects no
change. On average, the active group showed improved alertness on this measure whereas the sham group showed decreased
alertness, resulting in an effect size of 1.01 (P = 0.08). Five of
the 8 subjects in the active CPAP group had positive scores,
indicative of improved alertness, whereas 6 of the 8 subjects
in the sham CPAP group had negative scores. Examination of
the individual subject data suggests that the direction of change
indicated on the SWMT composite index is in good agreement
with the data from the other measures.
Other measures of neurocognitive function were also used
to assess changes in attention and psychomotor function, learning and memory, as well as executive and frontal-lobe function.
With respect to attention and psychomotor function, the effect
sizes ranged from 0.01 to 1.02. The active group showed trends
toward greater improvement compared to the sham group. For
measures of learning and memory, the effect sizes ranged from
0.26 to 0.40, with an effect size of 0.26 for the BSRT; there
was a significant difference for the active group between their
baseline and post-CPAP values. For measures of executive and
frontal-lobe function, the effect sizes ranged from 0.14 to 1.32.

**1B. Primary Neurocognitive Outcome Analyses**
The per-protocol intention-to-treat analyses[7] specified that
all primary efficacy outcomes be regressed on study arm, days
since randomization, and their interaction using generalized estimating equations (GEE)[8] to account for the repeated measures
on participants over time; the primary comparison was the difference between slopes (active vs. sham) across time.
Upon presenting these initial analyses to the SC it was determined that the GEE method outlined in the protocol could not be
applied across the Baseline, 2M and 6M visits for all three primary outcomes. SC decided that generalized regression models
(generalized linear models [GLM] or generalized linear mixed
models [GLMM]) be alternatively fit to the primary outcomes.
For CogScreen Pathfinder Number-Total Time (PFNTOTL), repeated measure mean comparisons were estimated
by GLMM.
For the Buschke Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall
(BSRT-SR), a difference was identified in the difficulty of the
form versions[9] between baseline and the 2 or 6 month administrations; therefore, the Steering Committee (SC) voted that comparisons could not be made across the three visits. Instead, SC
specified that comparisons be conducted separately for each postrandomization visit using GLM. For covariate-adjusted analyses,
the baseline BSRT-SR score was included as a covariate.
Sustained Working Memory Test-Overall Mid-day Index (SWMT-OMD) was provided as a change-from-baseline
score. SC voted that comparisons could not be made across
the three visits based on the structure of this variable. Instead,
comparison was of mean change-from-baseline score by visit, as estimated by a GLM fit to the dataset for 2M and 6M.


y p ( )
against the combination of the morning, mid-day, and afternoon
measurements at baseline, which advances the possibility that
change scores may be confounded with diurnal variation.

**1C. Intention-to-Treat Parameters**
The protocol specified that analyses be conducted in accordance with the intention-to-treat principle.[10,11] On this basis, all
participants who dropped (due to a participant-initiated decision) or were disqualified (due to a physician-initiated decision
based on medical/safety reasons) were invited to continue attending study visits and provide protocol-specified data, even if
they discontinued their originally assigned therapy. As a result,
an individual analyzed as active may not have used CPAP at
all or an individual analyzed as sham either may not have used
CPAP (sham or active) at all or used active CPAP for a portion
of the intervention period. All analyses were performed strictly
based on the participants’ original randomization assignments,
with the exception of seven participants (3 had an AHI < 10 and
were excluded after PSG quality control, and 4 had inadvertent
exposure to both treatment conditions as a result of staff error
rather than participant choice; the decisions to exclude these
participants were made by SC). Quantities of participants OnTreatment (completed visits on originally assigned treatment
condition) vs. On-Study (completed visits, but may or may not
have been on originally assigned treatment condition) are reported in Figure 1 of the manuscript.
Another aspect of the intention-to-treat principle regards
inclusion of individuals who were randomized but only completed a baseline visit with no post-randomization follow-up
visits. For the primary neurocognitive outcomes, the protocol
specified that all three visits were to be used together in a
longitudinal regression analysis with GEE. This analysis included participants who had only a baseline visit, and was
the analysis employed for PFN-TOTL. For BSRT-SR, analyses were run separately by visit due to differences in forms
between visits (see Section 1B). Here, participants who only
had a baseline visit were included in the means comparison
between arms at baseline. For SWMT-OMD, the data were
provided as a change score. As a result, participants who only
had a baseline visit were excluded from this analysis (see Section 1B). The retention-adjusted analyses were formulated as
a change-from-baseline variable for all three primary neurocognitive findings. When allowance was made for potentially
informative dropout via selection modeling, results for the
primary neurocognitive outcomes remain unchanged from
the results reported in the main paper without this adjustment. The secondary neurocognitive analysis plan specified
that all three visits were to be used together in a longitudinal
mixed-model regression (GLMM). This was done for CogScreen Shifting Attention Test Discovery Condition- Rule
Changes Completed Dichotomized (SAT-DIRUL), CogScreen
Pathfinder Number-Reaction Time (PFN-RTC), Psychomotor
Vigilance Task-Mean Slowest 10% of Reaction Times (PVTMSRT), and PVT Median RT (PVT-MDRT); so that participants who only had a baseline visit were included in these
analyses. As with BSRT-SR, analyses of BSRT Delayed Recall (BSRT-DR) were performed by visit for each of the three

a person’s outcome through the retention-adjusted analyses
(Section 8). Those analyses provide some evidence for informative missingness in that change from baseline for some of
the primary neurocognitive outcomes are correlated with tendency to discontinue. However, we found that adjusting for
this through the use of Heckman-type selection models did not
change the primary efficacy findings.
No imputation was performed except for the KolmogorovSmirnov two-sample test analysis of adherence as outcome
(Section 5A), where one version imputed missing values to zeros before calculating mean per person. Imputing missing to
zero did not change findings from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
two-sample test.
In tables, figures, and text, reported sample sizes that don’t
sum to the entire randomized sample size of 1,098, this disparity was due to missing data in outcomes and/or covariates. See
Section 6 on participant retention for additional details.

and SWMT-Behavioral Index: Mid-day (SWMT-BMD) were
provided as change from baseline scores; so analyses of these
two secondary outcomes excluded those participants who
only had a baseline visit.

**1D. Assessing Model Assumptions**
For all GEE, GLMM and GLM analyses for both the primary and secondary neurocognitive analyses, we checked
variance and link assumptions.[12] Residuals were plotted
against fitted values and against model covariates to ensure
that a given model was not misspecified. This procedure also
provided a final check on data quality to confirm no outliers
existed in these data. Influence diagnostics were performed
as needed to assess model fit. In some cases, polynomial
terms (up to cubic) for continuous covariates were added to
improve fit.
For the primary neurocognitive parametric survival model fit
to PFN-TOTL, model fit was assessed via simulating data from
the fitted model and comparing observed data versus simulated
values. For GLMM, we employed a random intercept for each
participant and assessed if random effects were approximately
normally distributed. GLMM fitting employed adaptive gaussian quadrature. For GLMM analyses of the secondary neurocognitive variables SAT-DIRUL, PFN-RTC, PVT-MSRT, and
PVT-MDRT, data were centered and scaled to aid algorithm
convergence.


**1E. Treatment of Missing Data**
GEE (Section 2A) assumed data were missing completely
at random (MCAR). GLM and GLMM (Sections 2 and 3) assumed that data were missing at random (MAR). MAR and
MCAR[13] are both types of missingness that assume that data
are missing for reasons unrelated to the outcome that would


**2A. Per-Protocol GEE Regression Analyses for Primary**
**Neurocognitive Outcomes**
The per-Protocol GEE analysis for the PFN-TOTL variable
is presented in Figure S1. This outcome was regressed on study
arm, days since randomization, and interaction using GEE. We
tested the hypothesis that the slope over time (DX, 2M, 6M)
differed between study arms (P = 0.8663).
No GEE models testing slope over time were fit for BSRTSR or SWMT-OMD (see Section 1B).

**2B. GLM, GLMM, and Parametric Survival Analyses**
In general, GLM were used for by-visit comparisons and
GLMM were used to model repeated measures data. All means
reported from GLM and GLMM are least-squares means centered at the mean values of all continuous covariates and at
observed marginal frequencies of categorical variables.[14]
Parametric survival analyses were conducted on PFN-TOTL
for by-visit comparisons since these data were right censored
at 60. Assessment of model assumptions was addressed in
Section 1D and treatment of missing data was reviewed in
Section 1E.
For unadjusted analyses a parametric survival analysis was
run for PFN-TOTL and GLM analyses were run by visit (2M
and 6M) for BSRT-SR and SWMT-OMD.
For covariate adjusted analyses, parametric GLMM analyses were run for repeated measurements (baseline, 2M and
6M) of PFN-TOTL and GLM analyses were run by visit (2M
and 6M) for BSRT-SR and SWMT-OMD. PFN-TOTL data
were reciprocal transformed for analysis and back-transformed for reporting. Covariate-adjusted analyses included
the randomization factors. For all outcomes, covariates were
OSA severity, sex, race, %TSTO2 < 85, age < 60 years, WASI
verbal IQ and performance IQ. A pre-randomization baseline was also included as a covariate for BSRT-SR and PFNTOTL, and months since randomization was also included for
PFN-TOTL. Group by OSA severity interactions were included, allowing the difference in active vs. sham means to change

*P < 0.05 indicates statistical significance.


**2C. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons at Final Analyses after**
**Multiple Interim Analyses**
For the purpose of adjusting for multiplicity, the tests run
by primary neurocognitive outcome and visit (2M and 6M)
without adjustment for covariates were utilized. Adjustments
for multiple comparisons were limited to the 2M and 6M visits for the three primary neurocognitive outcomes, for those
analyses without adjustment for covariates and without stratification. These six primary neurocognitive hypothesis tests are
presented in Table S2 with and without adjustment for multiple
comparisons at final. O’Brien-Fleming spending across three
interim analyses left 3.07% Type-I Error for the final analysis.[15]
Correction for multiple comparisons at final analyses employed
sequential Bonferroni adjustment.[16]

None of the six primary neurocognitive analyses were significant after these adjustments were made.

**2D. GLM by OSA Severity between 2M and 6M Visits within Arms**
GLM analyses were run for SWMT-OMD with covariates to determine whether there was a significant difference
in the SWMT-OMD at 2M vs. 6M (6M Minus 2M) when
compared within each OSA severity level and study arm
(Table S3). In addition to study arm and OSA severity, covariates were sex, race, %TSTO2 < 85, age < 60 years, WASI
Verbal IQ, and WASI Performance IQ. Confidence interval
lower bounds (CI LB) and upper bounds (UB) are provided
for each estimated mean.

**2E. GLM with %TSTO2 < 85 Quartiles**
GLM analyses stratified by quartiles of %TSTO2 < 85, study
arm, and visit are presented in Table S4 (without adjustment
for any other covariates). Estimates of the means for the neurocognitive (NC) outcomes are compared between the lower
three %TSTO2 < 85% quartiles vs. the upper quartile (most hypoxic) within visits and study arms. Estimates are least squares
means.[14] Quartiles were estimated by first pooling the data
across both study arms. Quartile analyses were designed based
on work by Quan and colleagues.[17]

The results for the SWMT-OMD are discussed in the main
text; however, the significant findings for the PFN-TOTL and
BSRT-SR (shown below) are not described since the primary


**2F. Neurocognitive Change Scores for Participants with Baseline**
**ESS > 10 or MWT ≤ 14.5**
These sub-analyses were conducted to determine the association of clinically significant subjective and objective
sleepiness on our primary outcomes. Two-sample t-tests were
performed for participants with a baseline Epworth Sleepiness
Scale-Total Score (ESS-TS) > 10 (subjectively sleepy participants; Table S5); this ESS-TS score is indicative of clinically significant sleepiness. Separate analyses were also run
for participants with a baseline MWT-Mean Sleep Latency
(MWT-MSL) score ≤ 14.5 (objectively sleepy participants).
This threshold was selected because it is 1 SD below the
MWT-MSL for a population of normal individuals tested for a
20-minute MWT trial duration.[18] SWMT-OMD is already formulated as a change-from-baseline score for the 2M and 6M
visits. For BSRT-DR and PFN-TOTL, change-from-baseline
scores were calculated for both 2M and 6M (2M Minus DX
and 6M Minus DX, respectively).

**2G. Correlation Coefficients for Participants with Baseline**
**MWT ≤ 14.5**
Analyses were run for a subgroup of objectively sleepy participants. To evaluate the correlation of the change from baseline
MWT-MSL score and the change from baseline primary neurocognitive score at both 2M and 6M by study arm, Spearman
correlation coefficients and P values were obtained (Table S6).

Based on a recommendation by the APPLES Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the APPLES Team utilized an
independent team of neurocognitive experts to assist them in
creating an a priori Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis Plan.
Following multiple conference calls and the dissemination of
materials related to the APPLES neurocognitive test battery, including the psychometric properties (normative data, test-retest
reliability, and trends including potential practice effects) for
each outcome, a summary of the literature, and the APPLES
Methods Paper,[7] the team of neurocognitive experts provided

Twelve variables were identified across the three neurocognitive domains of attention and psychomotor function (A/P), learning and memory (L/M), and executive and
frontal-lobe function (E/F): 1) Psychomotor Vigilance TaskMedian Reaction Time (PVT-MDRT); 2) PVT-Mean Slowest
10% of Reaction Times (PVT-MSRT); 3) PFN-Reaction Time
(PFN-RTC); 4) CogScreen Symbol Digit Coding-Correct Responses (SDC-CORR); 5) CogScreen Shifting Attention Task
Instruction Condition-Thruput (SAT-INPUT); 6) BSRT-Summary Score (BSRT-MSUM): Mean of BSRT-SR, Long-term
Storage (LTS), Long-term Retrieval (LTR), and Consistent
Long-term Retrieval (CLTR); 7) BSRT Delayed Recall-Total
Recall (BSRTDR-TR); 8) Paced Auditory Serial Addition
Test-total Correct (PASAT-TC); 9) CogScreen Shifting Attention Task Discovery Condition-Rule Shifts Completed
(SAT-DIRUL); 10) CogScreen Pathfinder Combined-Total
Time (PFC-TOTL); 11) SWMT-Activation Index: Mid-day
(SWMT-AMD); and 12) SWMT-Behavioral Index: Mid-day
(SWMT-BMD) (Table S7).
The plan specified that these 12 variables be shortened to a
short list of approximately 4-6 variables which best preserve
the information structure of all 12 using a statistical dimensionality reduction method.

**3B. Selection of a Statistical Dimension Reduction Method**
The APPLES _a priori_ Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis
Plan specified that the method of Krzanowski[19] be used to reduce our 12 secondary neurocognitive outcomes to a set of 4
to 6. Upon beginning that work using the follow-on paper by
Wang and Gehan[20] a subtle, but important math error was detected in the published method. This error was traced back to an
error made in the first paper in the series.[21] The APPLES Data
Coordinating Center (DCC) was reluctant to use a method that
was specified incorrectly in the literature and for which no proposed correction has undergone formal peer review.
Based on this finding, Independent Component Analysis
(ICA) was employed instead of Krzanowski’s method. ICA has
the “goal of decomposing measured signals or variables into
a set of underlying variables,”[22] which is exactly what was required per the APPLES Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis
Plan. The decision to change the method for dimension reduc

We selected those secondary neurocognitive outcomes that
met the following criterion: If an ICA component was very
highly correlated with one and only one of the original 12 outcomes, and had low correlation with all other outcomes, evidence suggested that outcome provided a separable source of
non-redundant information.

**3C. Covariate Adjusted Regression Models for Secondary**
**Neurocognitive Outcomes**
Covariate adjusted regression models were fit for the 7 secondary neurocognitive outcomes identified by ICA. GLMM
were utilized to account for the repeated measures for CogScreen (PFN and SAT-D) and PVT outcomes (DX, 2M, 6M),
while GLM was run by visit (2M and 6M) for BSRT and
SWMT outcomes (Table S8). The covariates included in this
analysis were those designated in the secondary analysis plan
as being the most likely to explain variation in these outcomes.
Covariate-adjusted analyses included the randomization factors. In addition to study arm, covariates were: OSA severity,
sex, race, %TSTO2 < 85, age < 60 years, WASI Verbal IQ, and

since randomization was also included as a covariate for the
repeated measures analyses for PFN and PVT. Group by OSA
severity interactions were included in the regression models,
allowing a difference in active vs. sham means for each level of
OSA severity. SAT-D was formulated as a dichotomized variable (≤ 2 vs. ≥ 3) based on a 5[th] percentile cut-off for studies performed for pilots, based on recommendations from
the developer of this test. PFN and PVT data were reciprocal
transformed for analysis and back-transformed for reporting.

**Adherence**
Spearman Correlation Coefficients were obtained to evalu

(for 2M and 6M) with CPAP adherence (Table S9). Mean
hours of adherence for the 2 months prior to the neurocognitive visit was used as the CPAP adherence variable. The
number of days on the SmartCard was the denominator for
this variable.

**SECTION 5. RESULTS – CPAP ADHERENCE**

**5A. Mean Hours of Nightly Usage – Entire Study Duration**
Figure S2 presents the frequency distribution of mean
hours of nightly CPAP usage per participant by study arm.
All of the CPAP adherence data for the duration of a patient’s
follow-up were used to calculate his/her mean. The P value is for the comparison of distributions between arms via
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test.[23] Figure S3 plots
the 24-hour CPAP usage values by study arm for the entire
follow-up duration for the 1,098 randomized participants.
The horizontal axis is a random jitter (i.e., each observation
was paired with a number from a uniform distribution on
the interval 0 to 1) of these data. In the active CPAP arm,
the greatest frequency of usages is between 5 and 7 hours.
Also notice the higher density of zero and near-zero usage
for sham. For all adherence analyses presented in this section, missing data were assumed to be non-informative. We

Table S10 compares mean hours of nightly CPAP usage between the study arms for various durations (1 night, 1 week, 1
month, and 2 months) prior to the 2M- and 6M-CPAP Visits
using permutation testing. Four different durations were utilized to thoroughly describe CPAP adherence prior to the neurocognitive visits and to select the most informative variable for
CPAP adherence-adjusted analyses.
Mean hours of adherence were longest for the night prior to a
neurocognitive visit, decreasing as the duration was lengthened
to 1 week and 1 month prior to a visit. Mean hours of nightly
adherence seemed to stabilize over 1 and 2 month durations.

**5C. ≥ 4 hours for > 70% of the Time – Various Durations Prior to**
**the 2M and 6M Visits**
A chi square analysis was run to compare between study
arms the number of participants with ≥ 4 hours of CPAP use for

- 70% of the nights for each of the given durations (1 night, 1
week, 1 month, and 2 months) prior to the 2M- and 6M-CPAP
Visits (Table S11). The percentages are the number of participants divided by the sample size for each row.
Four different durations were utilized to thoroughly describe
CPAP adherence prior to the neurocognitive visits. The number
of participants who met the adherence criterion was the greatest for the night prior to a neurocognitive visit, decreasing as
the duration was lengthened to 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months


**5D. Participant Treatment Group Guesses by Arm**
Prior to unblinding participants to their assigned treatment
group condition, participants were asked to guess to which
study arm they believed they had been assigned (Figure S4). A
κ coefficient was used to estimate the degree of chance-adjusted
agreement between participant guesses and arm assignment. A
total of 69.67% of sham CPAP participants correctly guessed
their treatment assignment vs. 55.28% of active CPAP participants (κ = 0.25, P < 0.0001). A κ coefficient of 0.25 is suggestive of relatively poor agreement.[24]

_“Each APPLES participant will be followed closely by the_

_event of a difficult CPAP compliance problem.”_
Despite these efforts, substantial variation in adherence was
observed in both study arms (Figure S6). Reduction in adherence was most pronounced for participants in the sham arm by
the 6M visit.

**7B. Adherent Subgroup Analysis**
Consider a subpopulation restricted to just those “adherent”
individuals who use their assigned device for at least 4 hours per
night on average in the two months prior to the visit (2M and
6M). An analysis comparing baseline variables for the group of
adherent individuals vs. non-adherent individuals at both the
2M and 6M time points revealed significant differences in a
number of baseline variables (Tables S12 and S13). Adherent
individuals appear to be older on average (2M 4.8 yrs higher,
P < 0.0001; 6M 5.4 yrs higher, P < 0.0001), are more likely to
be White (2M/6M P < 0.0001) and married (2M P = 0.0474,
6M P = 0.0161), and have higher WASI IQ scores on average
(e.g., IQFull4WASI: 2M 5.1 points higher, P < 0.0001; 6M 4.5
points higher, P < 0.0001). Some differences in baseline polysomnographic variables also emerged. On average, the group of
CPAP-adherent individuals at 2M and 6M have a lower sleep
efficiency percentage at baseline (2M 1.9% lower, P = 0.0296;
6M 3.8% lower, P < 0.0001); and at 6M, adherers had a shorter
total sleep time (15 minutes lower, P = 0.0011), longer sleep
latency (4.2 minutes higher, P = 0.0063), longer REM latency
(5.4 minutes higher, P = 0.0221), and a lower percentage of
stage 3 sleep (0.67% lower, P = 0.0424).
In the adherent subpopulation, means of the baseline vari

comes were compared between the sham and active conditions,
by post-randomization visit (Table S14). Mean scores are approximately 2.5 units lower at 6M (P = 0.0453) on the IQ Verbal
WASI for those on active compared to those on sham.

**7C. Dose Response**
The APPLES SC wished to know if variation in adherence
could be responsible for variation in the primary neurocognitive (1NC) outcomes. In particular it was thought that a doseresponse relationship may exist between adherence and 1NC
outcomes. As demonstrated in section 7b, a potential difficulty
with such an assessment is that each participant can self-select
his/her level of adherence. Self-selection opens the possibility
that participants who adhere more are different on other traits
from those who adhere less (Table S12). If some of these traits
drive variation in adherence and in neurocognitive performance, then confounding may be present. Namely, a detected
association between adherence and a 1NC outcome may actually be due in whole or in part to one or more other factors―
confounders. Unless analysis adjusts for any such confounders
effectively, then variation in a 1NC outcome could be wrongly
attributed to variation in CPAP adherence.


**7D. Search for Confounders**
Various methods have been developed in the statistical
literature for adherence adjustment in the presence of possible confounders. Given that CPAP adherence was captured
on a continuous scale in APPLES, the generalized propensity
method of Imbens[25,26] seems well-suited for this purpose. This
method allows construction of a dose-response curve between
adherence to the active condition and a 1NC outcome within
each study arm while balancing on observed potential baseline
confounders. Mean response is then compared between study
arms at points along these curves to assess the effects of sham

the same set of confounders has been performed in both arms
and randomization should ensure that treatment assignment is
independent of a person’s baseline features.
Before proceeding to that modeling exercise, a list of possible confounders was first identified. APPLES’ investigators
compiled a comprehensive list of possible confounders that
were captured in the database (i.e., variables possibly causally
related to both adherence and 1NC outcome). These 102 variables are listed in Table S15. Development of this list erred on
the side of including too many rather than too few candidates
to avoid missing any true confounders that had been observed.

**7E. Adherence Adjustment**
The generalized propensity score method was applied, closely following section 7.4 of Hirano and Imbens.[26] Estimation
of generalized propensity scores for adherence to the active
condition employed the variables of Table S15, was performed
separately for each visit (2M and 6M), and used the sample
from the active arm, with variable selection via the lasso and
coefficient estimation via least squares. The resultant estimated


Difference between active and sham in mean dose-response
was compared at nine levels of adherence (0, 1,…8 hours), as
summarized in Table S16. Table S16 reveals a difference in
means between study arms at the six-month visit for Overall
Midday at 3 and 4 hours of adherence. The fact that differences
are detected only at intermediate levels of adherence may be
in part a statistical artifact, in that error in estimates of a fitted
mean are wider toward the lower and upper ends of the extent
of the regressor,[31] which here is adherence. Adherence was employed as a regressor in the second of three stages of the method
of Hirano and Imbens.[26]

There is the possibility that the difference detected for
SWMT Overall Midday was due to sham worsening. Table
2 in the manuscript provides estimates at 2M for active mean

[CI] of 0.035 [-0.019 to 0.090] and for sham mean [CI] of
-0.074 [-0.133 to -0.015]), where the confidence bounds on
the mean for sham indicate a significant decline from baseline for sham. Also from Table 2 in the manuscript, estimates
at 6M for active mean [CI] are 0.072 [0.012 to 0.132] and
for sham mean [CI] are 0.018 [-0.046 to 0.082]. Adherence

comparability between 2M and 6M, direct standardization[32]
was used to provide an overall estimate per arm at 6M wherein
each of the nine adherence-adjusted means (Table S16) were
weighted according to the observed (see footnote A following appendix) frequency of participants of 0, 1,…8 hours of
adherence at 2M.
This adjustment at 6M resulted in an estimated active mean

[CI] of 0.098 [-0.035 to 0.231] and estimated sham mean [CI]
of -0.002 [-0.010 to0.097]. Direct-standardization -adjusted and
unadjusted point estimates of the mean for active indicate possible improvement at 6M from baseline. With direct standard

two-fold larger than without this standardization; although the
confidence interval for the direct-standardization estimates of
means for sham and active each include a mean change score
of zero. The estimate for the sham mean has become negative,
which agrees with the finding at 2M for sham worsening. However, we do not have evidence at 6M for a statistically significant decline from baseline, based on confidence intervals, so
the possibility of sham worsening to completely explain our
findings remains an open question. The confidence interval on
the difference in direct-standardization means (active mean –
sham mean) is [-0.056, 0.256], which includes a difference in
means of zero.

**7F. Future Work**
We recognize that the extension of propensity methods to
non-binary exposure variables has been an active area of research. Further analyses which adjust for adherence could certainly be conducted on the APPLES data that make use of other
generalized propensity approaches, such as those of Imai and
Van Dyk (2004).[33] Moreover, combined adjustment for adherence dose-response and retention merits exploration. These topics are being addressed in a separate manuscript in preparation.

**8A. Model Specification**
A Heckman-type selection model was employed.[34] Let Δ be
change from baseline on the neurocognitive outcome and D be
the (latent) measure of the tendency to discontinue follow-up.
Both outcomes are continuous. For person i,

where Xi and Zi are the variables associated with their respective outcomes, β and **γ are vectors of regression coefficients,**
and the {E1i, E2i} follow a bivariate normal distribution of mean
{0, 0} and correlation parameter ρ. Δ _i_ is only observed when
_Di > 0, That is, change scores on neurocognitive outcomes are_
only observed when the tendency to discontinue follow up
crosses a threshold, typically set arbitrarily to zero as here. De

**8B. Assessing Model Assumptions**

**_i. Bivariate normal distribution_**
Because the bivariate normality assumption is untestable, the
model of section 1 was run for different transformations (log,

and 3/2 [see footnote B following appendix]) (cf. ref35) of
the observed change scores . Results are summarized in Table
S18 for baseline to 2M and baseline to 6M.
Overall, these results in combination with those for the untransformed outcome (Table S22) indicate that findings with
regard to treatment effects are robust to assumptions about the
shape of the distribution of the change outcome (conditional on
the Xi ). The one possible exception is for PFN Total at 2M. For
this outcome and visit, a more definitive analysis could explore
application of methods which explicitly relax assumptions
about the distributions of E1 and E2 (refs in [36]).

**_ii. Collinearity_**
Correlations among the variables listed in Table S17 were examined.[31] None were found to be highly correlated with each other,
with all estimated correlations less than 0.74 (Tables S19 and S20).

**_iii. Exclusion Restriction_**
To help distinguish the processes that govern discontinuation
versus neurocognitive performance, it is desirable to have covariates (possible “instruments”) associated with the tendency


p g
neurocognitive outcome.[37] Table S21 reveals that possible instruments were identified for all models fit except PFN Total at two
months. Negative coefficients on the indicator variable for active
arm suggest that sham condition caused dropout. Those participants with higher quality of life, higher intelligence, older age and
better oxygen saturation status at baseline were less likely to discontinue; and these variables may serve as instruments as well.

change from baseline (conditional on the covariates Xi and Zi)
were statistically significant for Sum Recall, at two months and
six months, and for Overall Midday at six months. The negative
sign of the correlation for Sum Recall by two months suggests
that participants who are doing worse neurocognitively have
greater tendency to leave during this early phase of follow-up.
This situation may change during late follow-up. The positive
signs on correlation coefficients by six months indicate that
participants who do worse neurocognitively are less likely to
discontinue by the end of six months of follow-up. The results
by six months are stronger evidence in two regards. (1) Significant correlations were identified for two primary neurocognitive
outcomes (Sum Recall and Overall Midday) and perhaps a third
(PFN Total, P = 0.0549) while only one correlation was significant by two months (Sum Recall). (2) Estimated correlations are
larger in absolute value by six months compared to two months.

**8D. Conclusions**
i. Results are generally robust to transformations on the neurocognitive outcome, no evidence of collinearity among
the covariates of Table S17 were identified, and possible
instruments were detected for the completion outcome.
Taken altogether, the assumptions underlying application
of a Heckman-type selection model appear to have been
satisfied. One possible exception might be PFN Total at
2M, for which detection of a treatment effect did vary
with transformation and for which no possible instruments
were detected.
ii. Different factors (possible instruments) may govern dropout (Table S21). Among these, the sham condition appears


denced for all three primary outcomes. Differential dropout between arms was also identified via life-table and
competing risks analyses, as reported in the main paper.
iii. Completion status appears to be associated with change
from baseline ( of Table S22) after adjusting for covariates. In particular, evidence from Sum Recall suggests
those who do worse neurocognitively during the first two
months are more likely to leave the study early; but, by the
end of follow-up, evidence from two to perhaps all three
neurocognitive outcomes suggests those who are doing
worse neurocognitively are less likely to leave the study.
Evidence is stronger for the latter finding.
iv. Taking these results together, by six months the sham condition appears to cause some amount of discontinuation;
however, beyond that effect, those who are doing worse
neurocognitively are less inclined to discontinue.
v. When allowance is made for the potentially informative
dropout via selection modeling, statistical detectabilities of
treatment effects on primary outcomes remain unchanged
( of Table S22) compared to the results reported in the
main paper without this adjustment.

**SECTION 9. RESULTS – SAFETY**
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events
(AEs) were categorized into one of 17 body systems/event
categories by the DCC Medical Director. Analyses were performed on all post-randomization SAEs and AEs and tabulated to report incidence proportions. Multiple events for an
individual subject were recorded and defined as a single OnStudy incidence. All safety analyses used GLM. The Poisson

than 10%). For non-rare events, the binomial distribution was
employed to account for the greater dependence of the variance on the finite population size. Table S23 provides comparisons of incidence proportions between study arms made for all
SAEs in the Cardiovascular, motor vehicle accident (MVA), or
Death event categories. These three body system/event categories were deemed the most import to examine by the APPLES
Steering Committee and Data and Safety Monitoring Board
(DSMB). Table S24 provides comparisons of incidence rates
between study arms for all safety events (SAE+AE) in all body
system/event categories.

**FOOTNOTE A**
We conditioned on the observed frequencies. A more thorough analysis would incorporate the sampling error in the estimated frequencies from the sample at 2M. This would not alter
conclusions here because reported conditional confidence intervals include zero.

**FOOTNOTE B**
The transformations were actually more complicated than
this. A shift constant was added to each variable to make all
values positive before logarithmic, square-root or 3/2 power
