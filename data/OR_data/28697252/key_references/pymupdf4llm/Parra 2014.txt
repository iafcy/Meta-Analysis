INTRODUCTION


SUMMARY
#### The main purpose of the present analysis is to assess the influence of introducing early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment on cardiovascular recurrences and mortality in patients with a first-ever ischaemic stroke and moderate–severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) ≥20 events h[�][1]
 during a 5-year follow-up. Patients received conventional treatment for stroke and were assigned randomly to the nCPAP group (n = 71) or the control group (n = 69). Cardiovascular events and mortality were registered for all patients. Survival and cardiovascular event-free survival analysis were performed after 5-year follow-up using the Kaplan–Meier test. Patients in the nCPAP group had significantly higher cardiovascular survival than the control group (100 versus 89.9%, log-rank test 5.887; P = 0.015) However, and also despite a positive tendency, there were no significant differences in the cardiovascular event-free survival at 68 months between the nCPAP and control groups (89.5 versus 75.4%, log-rank test 3.565; P = 0.059). Early nCPAP therapy has a positive effect on long-term survival in ischaemic stroke patients and moderate–severe OSA.


Sleep-related breathing disorders (SBD), and specifically
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), have been suggested to be a
risk factor for stroke (Shahar et al., 2001; Yaggi et al., 2005)
and an independent predictor of outcome in the affected
patients in terms of functional recovery (Good et al., 1996)
and mortality (Parra et al., 2004; Sahlin et al., 2008).
Furthermore, in a recent randomized controlled study we
have shown that early use of nasal continuous positive
airway pressure (nCPAP) in patients with a first-ever


ischaemic stroke with moderate–severe OSA [apnea–
hypopnea index (AHI) ≥20 events h[�][1]] is associated with
a significant improvement in neurological scales compared
with the control group 1 month after stroke. Despite this
better neurological initial recovery, cardiovascular recurrences and mortality were not significantly different between
both groups when considered at 2-year follow-up probably,
among other factors, because the follow-up was not long
enough (Parra et al., 2011).
The purpose of the present analysis is therefore to
compare cardiovascular recurrences and mortality on a

long-term basis between the two groups in this stroke patient
setting, with an AHI ≥20 events h[�][1] (currently considered
moderate–severe OSA, this associated with an increase in
cardiovascular events) (Marin et al., 2005), assigned randomly to the nCPAP or control groups (Parra et al., 2011), in
a 5-year follow-up.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Design overview

A prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-centre study
was designed to test the hypothesis that early nCPAP
treatment in patients with moderate and severe OSA may
affect outcome favourably in patients with a first-ever
ischaemic stroke, in terms of neurological improvement,
quality of life (Parra et al., 2011), occurrence of new
cardiovascular events and mortality.

Setting and participants

Between September 2005 and December 2006, all patients
with first-ever ischaemic stroke admitted consecutively to the
Neurology Services of seven acute-care teaching hospitals
throughout Spain were eligible. Inclusion criteria were age
<75 years and at least one of the following conditions:
habitual snoring, observed apneas or history of hypertension
or a heart disease. Patients with consciousness impairment
and patients previously diagnosed and treated for OSA were
excluded. The protocol consisted of a complete neurological
evaluation, assessment of cardiovascular risk factors, healthrelated quality of life as well as sleep studies. According to
the respiratory polygraph (RP) evaluation, and based on AHI
results, patients with AHI ≥ 20 were randomized to receive
conventional treatment (described later) for stroke (control
group) or conventional treatment plus nCPAP (nCPAP
group), started in the acute stroke phase. All patients were
followed initially for 24 months, a period in which patients
from the nCPAP group remained with this respiratory device
(Parra et al., 2011). Further telephone contact 5 years after
the stroke provided data collection on survival and cardiovascular events for the present analysis.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of the participating centres. Written informed consent
was obtained from all patients or their families.

Study procedures

Neurological and outcome data were recorded following the
standardized protocol of the Hospital del Sagrat Cor Stroke
Registry (Arboix et al., 1998). Stroke subtypes were classified according to the Cerebrovascular Study Group of the
Spanish Society of Neurology (Arboix et al., 1998), including
transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke (atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, lacunar, unusual or undetermined
origin) and intraparenchymatous haemorrhagic stroke. For


the purpose of this study, only patients with ischaemic stroke
were selected.
Functional abilities were assessed using the Barthel index
(Mahoney and Barthel, 1965), a multi-faceted scale questionnaire that measures morbidity and daily living activities [0
(maximal disability) to 100 (no disability)], while maximal
stroke severity or neurological impairment was estimated
using the Canadian scale (Cote et al., 1986) [0 (maximal
impairment) to 10 (no impairment)]. The modified Rankin
scale (van Swieten et al., 1988) was used to assess outcome

[scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (death)]; selfreported health status was assessed with the SF-36 Quality
of Life questionnaire (Jenkinson et al., 1999).

Sleep studies

A sleep–wake habits and symptoms questionnaire consisted
of 15 items; a four-grade Likert scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often and always) was applied within the first 48–72 h
to assess snoring, observed apnea and hypersomnia in
different situations. Details of the questionnaire have been
reported previously by Parra et al. (2011), while daytime
sleepiness was assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale
(Johns, 1991). All answers were obtained from patients
themselves or, if needed, from their relatives.
A respiratory sleep study was performed in the ward during
the first 48–72 h after admission with a portable respiratory
recording device (Hypno TT Digital Recorder) that has been
validated previously using full polysomnography in stroke
patients (Parra et al., 2000). Respiratory nasal airflow (flow
nasal sensory), chest wall movements (impedance), heart
rate and thoracic impedance [electrocardiograph (ECG)
electrodes], arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2, finger pulse
oximetry) and body position (position sensor) were also
measured. Sleep-related breathing disorders were classified
as obstructive or central apnea (cessation of airflow for
≥10 s with maintenance of thoracic motion or without any
thoracic motion, respectively) or hypopnea (discernible
reduction in airflow or thoracic motion lasting >10 s and
associated with a cyclical dip in SaO2 of >3%). The AHI was
calculated based on the time spent in bed with the respiratory
recording device. Patients with an AHI ≥20 events h[�][1] of
predominantly obstructive type (more than 80% of total
count) were selected for randomization. In all cases, scoring
of all these variables was performed manually by an
experienced scorer, while the night-time percentage of
SaO2 of <90% (CT90) was obtained automatically.

Randomization and intervention

Patients with an AHI ≥20 were randomized to receive
conventional treatment for stroke plus nCPAP (nCPAP
group) or conventional treatment without nCPAP (control
group) using a computer-generated random list (1 : 1 ratio).
Autotitration polygraphic studies were carried out using a
validated portable system (Autoset Portable Plus II; ResMed,

ª 2014 European Sleep Research Society


-----

Sydney, Australia) (Molina et al., 2003). Optimal pressure
was determined visually on the raw data of the autoCPAP
device (‘view night profile’), analysing the pressure that
included 90% of the periods with a leak lower than 0.4 L/s
(90th percentile) normalized respiratory disturbances index
(Masa et al., 2004). Therefore, prescription with a fixed
nCPAP was derived from examination of the profiles of
pressure applied during autotitration CPAP.
In all patients assigned to the intervention arm, nCPAP
was started during hospital admission between the first 3 and
6 days after stroke onset. In all cases, nCPAP was administered by well-trained nurses of the sleep units of the
participating hospitals.
During the acute stroke phase, all patients were managed
in accordance with the recommendations of the Spanish
Cerebrovascular Study Group of the Spanish Society of
Neurology (conventional treatment), as described previously
by Arboix et al. (1998). The main strategies were: (i)
maintenance of blood pressure without the use of
hypotensive drugs (unless the systolic blood pressure was

≥ 220 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mm
Hg); (ii) early treatment of hyperglycaemia avoiding the use of
glucose infusion; (iii) prevention of pulmonary thromboembolism with low-dose heparin; and (iv) early antiplatelet
therapy except when anticoagulation was recommended.
Physical and respiratory therapies were also performed
during the patients’ stay in the hospital.

Outcomes and follow-up

After hospital discharge, patients were followed-up by a
neurologist and a pneumologist at outpatient clinics at 1, 3,
12 and 24 months after stroke. At all visits, evaluations
included a physical examination and the administration of the
Barthel index, Canadian scale, Rankin scale and SF-36.
Patients who received nCPAP during the acute stroke phase
were prescribed to continue with the respiratory device.
Compliance with nCPAP was considered adequate when the
system counter registered more than 4 h per night (70% of
the days) and was checked during all medical visits


-----

undertaken during the first 24 months of the study. Patients
were recommended to continue with the respiratory device
based on the pneumologist criteria and clinical patient
characteristics.
Cardiovascular events including cardiac ischaemic events,
stroke recurrence and cardiovascular mortality were recorded
during the study visits (the first 24 months) and through postvisit telephone contact at the end of the study for every
patient (median follow-up of 68 months).

Statistical analysis

A per-protocol analysis was carried out, excluding those
patients who declined nCPAP during hospitalization.
Baseline characteristics were analysed using descriptive
statistics. Categorical variables are presented in the form of


lists and proportions, while for quantitative variables
(continuous or ordinal) indices of central tendency (mean)
and dispersion [standard deviation (SD)] are also presented.
Comparison between groups was performed with Pearson’s
chi-squared test.
Survival analysis for each group was estimated using
Kaplan–Meier survival curves, considering the length of time
after randomization until occurrence of cardiovascular
events, survival probability estimates at 5-year and cardiovascular mortality. Significance was set at P < 0.05. All data
statistical analysis was made using SPSS for Windows.

Sleep studies allowed the classification of patients as
AHI<20 (n = 95) or AHI≥20 (n = 140). After randomization,
and exclusion of patients who initially refused nCPAP (n =
14) the final study sample comprised 57 patients assigned to
the nCPAP group and 69 patients for the control group (Parra
et al., 2011) (Fig. 1).
Baseline characteristics of both intervention groups were
similar for sociodemographics, salient clinical features of
stroke, frequency according to stroke subtypes, neurological
assessment and quality of life, except for ‘often observed
apnea at night’ (nCPAP 70.2 versus 46.4% in the control
group; P ≤ 0.01) and regarding alcohol abuse as a cardiovascular risk factor (21.8 versus 8.8%; P ≤ 0.05), which
were also significantly more frequent in the nCPAP group
(Table 1).
The mean (SD) number of hours with nCPAP after stroke
was 5.3 (1.9) per night, during a mean of 6.8 (0.6) nights per
week. Further data on nCPAP adherence and compliance
are detailed extensively in our previous paper (Parra et al.,
2011).

one renal failure in the control group (Table 2), with no
differences between both groups. In this study we compared patients with a first-ever ischaemic

stroke and selected those who, by means of RP, are
considered as having moderate–severe OSA (AHI ≥ 20),
and who were randomized to be treated or not with nCPAP
during the acute stroke phase with maintenance of the
respiratory device at long-term (5-year follow-up). Our present results suggest that stroke patients in such a setting,
when treated with early nCPAP treatment, not only have a
better neurological recovery (Parra et al., 2011), but also
higher cardiovascular survival at 5-year follow-up compared
to the control group.
The presence of obstructive events has been suggested
previously as a risk factor with harmful consequences in
stroke patients (Shahar et al., 2001; Yaggi et al., 2005), but
also as a possible prognostic factor based on its known
physiopathological mechanisms, although this relation has
not been demonstrated fully (Balfors and Franklin, 1994;
Figure 2. Cardiovascular survival [nasal continuous positive airway Drager et al., 2005; Minoguchi et al., 2005; Schulz et al.,
pressure (nCPAP) group and control group]. 2002). The results of our previous study also point in this

ª 2014 European Sleep Research Society


-----

direction (Parra et al., 2004). In spite of the known increase in
obstructive respiratory events through age, it has often been
difficult to establish their clinical relevance and influence on
stroke, a condition that usually occurs in elderly patients.
Previous studies have shown that sleep-related breathing
disorders in elderly people are frequent, and could also have
a deleterious impact for this age group (Munoz[~] et al., 2006).
The randomization to nCPAP for patients with AHI ≥ 20
was carried out based not only on the association of this
condition with high mortality in elderly people (Ancoli-Israel
et al., 1991), but also considering some possible limitations
of RP for the determination of AHI. Despite the advantages of
RP as a tool for early bedside evaluation in this particularly
difficult setting of stroke patients, previously documented
limitations such as underestimation of AHI and a higher
variability in AHI, especially at low values (<20 or even <30
depending on the studies) (Masa et al., 2011), led us to
consider a cutoff point at AHI≥20 to ensure that the group
could benefit from nasal CPAP treatment based on current
knowledge.
Our findings suggest that, in this setting, administration of
nCPAP might be advisable at least when moderate–severe
OSA is demonstrated in a stroke patient, which is a quite
prevalent condition in this group of patients (Parra et al.,
2000). Clearly, neurological recovery from stroke and shortor long-term survival depend upon a variety of factors, not
only on reducing the frequency of obstructive events, with
notable improvements since managing such patients in
specialized stroke units. However, and based on our results,
we consider that OSA are among the factors that should be
considered and controlled.
Our findings are also supported by the results of a recent
paper that recommends treatment with automatic nCPAP
even before determining the presence of apneas; in that
case, nCPAP was withdrawn when the subsequent polysomnography study indicated that the number of apneas was
not abnormally high (Bravata et al., 2011). Although this
approach is perhaps excessive, our study provides new data
in support of nCPAP in stroke patients and, importantly,
corroborates other studies suggesting that there is no risk to
the patient (Bravata et al., 2011; Parra et al., 2011). Naturally, patients must be selected carefully to ensure that
compliance with treatment will be satisfactory in the acute
phase; the results presented here should not be extrapolated
to more serious cases of stroke in which the feasibility of
treatment is not guaranteed.
In terms of survival, although no significant differences
were observed between groups in our previous 2-year followup study (Parra et al., 2011), due probably to a low mortality
rate regarding the non-severe characteristics of the studied
sample (age 75 years, first episode of stroke and ischaemic
stroke and consciousness to cooperate) and a limited followup period, our current findings show that after a median
follow-up of 68 months, the nCPAP group had significantly
higher cardiovascular survival and a higher cardiovascular
event-free survival in comparison to the control group.


Therefore, our current results suggest that nCPAP therapy
has a positive effect on the long-term survival in patients with
ischaemic stroke. Moreover, early nCPAP treatment in
ischaemic stroke patients might be beneficial not only in
initial neurological recovery, but to prevent cardiovascular
events on a long-term basis.
In summary, obstructive apneas have a negative effect on
neurological recovery in patients with ischaemic stroke. In our
current study a higher cardiovascular survival was obtained
in patients with nasal CPAP. Ongoing research should
explore this issue in more depth. In the future, efforts should
be made in order to define the group of patients with
ischaemic stroke who can benefit of this treatment.
