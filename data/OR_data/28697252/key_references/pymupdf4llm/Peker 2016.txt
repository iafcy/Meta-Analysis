**ABSTRACT**

**Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea is common in patients with coronary artery disease, many**

of whom do not report daytime sleepiness. First-line treatment for symptomatic obstructive

sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure, but its value in patients without daytime

sleepiness is uncertain.

**Objective: To determine the effects of continuous positive airway pressure on long-term**

adverse cardiovascular outcome risk in coronary artery disease patients with nonsleepy

obstructive sleep apnea.

**Methods: This single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded**

evaluation trial was conducted between December 2005 and November 2010. Consecutive

patients with newly revascularized coronary artery disease and obstructive sleep apnea

(apnea-hypopnea index ≥15/h) without daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score

<10) were randomized to auto-titrating continuous positive airway pressure (n=122) or no

positive airway pressure (n=122).

**Measurements: The primary endpoint was the first event of repeat revascularization,**

myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular mortality.

**Main Results: Median follow-up was 57 months. The incidence of the primary endpoint did**

not differ significantly in patients who did versus did not receive continuous positive airway

pressure (18.1% vs. 22.1%; hazard ratio 0.80; 95% confidence interval 0.46–1.41; P=0.449).

Adjusted on-treatment analysis showed a significant cardiovascular risk reduction in those

who used continuous positive airway pressure for ≥4 vs <4 h/night or did not receive

treatment (hazard ratio 0.29; 95% confidence interval 0.10–0.86; P=0.026).

**Conclusions: Routine prescription of continuous positive airway pressure to coronary artery**

disease patients with nonsleepy obstructive sleep apnea did not significantly reduce long-term


-----

adverse cardiovascular outcomes in the intention-to-treat population. There was a significant

reduction after adjustment for baseline comorbidities and compliance with the treatment.

#### Introduction

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common health problems in Western

countries, having a poor prognosis and a high risk of mortality (1). Moreover, an increasing

number of patients with CAD undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary

artery bypass grafting (CABG) with a considerable risk of relapse of CAD in the years

following the intervention, despite advances in medical treatment and revascularization

techniques (2, 3).

Many of the traditional risk factors contributing to adverse outcomes in these patients are

managed. However, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common condition in CAD patients (4),

has largely been neglected. The paucity of data on the contribution of OSA to adverse

outcomes in cardiac patients has been highlighted by the American Heart Association /

American College of Cardiology (5), and probably contributes to a lack of recognition of

OSA in the CAD setting.

Elimination of obstructive apneas and hypopneas with nasal continuous positive airway

pressure (CPAP) is first-line treatment for OSA, reducing daytime sleepiness and improving

quality of life (6). However, the majority of CAD patients with OSA do not experience

daytime sleepiness (i.e. asymptomatic), and there is currently no clearly established rationale

for treatment of such patients, notwithstanding clinical practice guidelines from the American

Academy of Sleep Medicine that generally recommend CPAP treatment for OSA (7).

Observational studies have demonstrated that CPAP is beneficial in patients with CAD and

OSA who are adherent to treatment (8-10). There are many published short-term randomized

controlled trials (RCTs) with CPAP, especially in OSA patients with systemic hypertension,

and CPAP has been shown to effectively lower blood pressure (BP) in these patients (11, 12).

However, other trials suggest no benefit of CPAP in those without daytime sleepiness (13,

14), except one, suggesting a significant BP reduction in patients with newly diagnosed


-----

hypertension (15). Overall, there is good evidence to suggest that symptomatic OSA patients

should be treated with CPAP to reduce daytime sleepiness (6) and the risk of traffic accidents

(16), and also perhaps to lower BP in hypertensive OSA patients (11, 12, 15). Nevertheless,

evidence from long-term prospective RCTs to determine whether cardiac patients with

nonsleepy OSA should be offered CPAP treatment to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and

mortality is lacking.

The Randomized Intervention with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in CAD and OSA

(RICCADSA) trial investigated the effects of CPAP on the risk of cardiovascular events in

patients with CAD and concomitant OSA without daytime sleepiness. Some of the results

have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (17).

#### Methods

**Study Design and Patients**

Methodological details have been published previously (18, 19), and are fully detailed in the

online supplement. The target population comprised adult patients with angiography-verified

CAD who had undergone PCI or CABG in Skaraborg County, West Sweden, in the previous

6 months, and had an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of <5/h or ≥15/h during a sleep study (see

online supplement). Patients with existing OSA, an AHI of 5.0–14.9/h, and predominantly

central apneas with Cheyne-Stokes respiration were excluded (Figure 1). Patients were

recruited between December 2005 and November 2010, and follow-up was completed in May

2013. The study was a single-center (two sites), prospective, open, randomized, parallel,

interventional, superiority trial of CPAP in CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA (AHI ≥15/h,

Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS] score <10) (Figure 1). Patients with CAD and sleepy OSA

phenotype (AHI ≥15/h, ESS score ≥10) receiving CPAP and CAD patients without OSA were


-----

followed as additional controls in observational arm for further post-hoc comparisons (to be

reported separately).

**Study Oversight**

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the

University of Gothenburg (approval nr 207-05; 09.13.2005; amendment T744-10; 11.26.2010;

amendment T512-11; 06.16.2011), and all patients provided written informed consent. A

blinded interim analysis was conducted in February 2010, and the protocol was amended with

a new power calculation for the primary endpoints (see below). An Independent Clinical

Event Committee (ICEC) reviewed all data obtained from hospital records and death

certificates by the end of May 2013, unaware of patient identities and group allocation. A

Data Monitoring Board reviewed the protocol and monitored a random 10% selection of the

database for baseline clinical data and follow-up procedures, including CPAP adherence and

primary endpoints. All authors prepared the manuscript for publication, and made the decision

to submit the manuscript without input from or review by ResMed Foundation and ResMed

Ltd, who partly funded the trial by institutional grants. All authors guarantee the accuracy and

completeness of the data. The trial was registered with the national researchweb.org (FoU i

Sverige – Research and development in Sweden; nr VGSKAS-4731; 04.29.2005) and with

ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT 00519597).

**Sleep Studies, Group Assignment and Randomization**

Details of home sleep recordings (cardiorespiratory polygraphy [PG]) and in-hospital

polysomnography (PSG) and randomization procedures are provided in the online

supplement. The 1:1 random assignment of patients with CAD and nonsleepy OSA was


-----

scheduled with a block size of eight patients (four CPAP, four controls) stratified by gender

and revascularization type (PCI/CABG).

**Interventions and Follow-up**

Nonsleepy OSA patients who were randomized to treatment were fitted with an automatic

CPAP device (S8[®] or S9[®]; ResMed) by trained staff. Additional follow-up details, including

adherence to CPAP treatment, are provided in the online supplement.

**Outcomes**

The primary endpoint was a composite of repeat revascularization, MI, stroke and

cardiovascular mortality. Information was obtained from patients’ medical records and, when

necessary, from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register as well as the Swedish National

Cause of Death Registry. Each event was evaluated separately and as part of the combined

endpoint. For patients who experienced more than one event during the follow-up period, only

the first event was included in the combined endpoint. All-cause mortality and acute hospital

admission for cardiovascular reasons were among the secondary endpoints. Criteria for the

cardiovascular diagnosis defined by the ICEC are available in the online supplement.

**Statistical Analysis**

Descriptive statistics are given as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and as numbers

(percentages). For baseline differences between the groups, the chi-squared test, and Fisher’s

exact test were applied. Total sleep time, time spent on supine position and AHI values on the

repeated sleep recordings (PG vs PSG) at the individual level were compared with paired t
test. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to test the linear relationship between the

AHI values on PG vs PSG. All statistical tests were two-sided, and a P-value <.05 was


-----

considered significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS[®] 22.0 for Windows[®]

(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA) and Stata version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station,

Texas, USA).

Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox Proportional hazards models were performed in the intention
to-treat (ITT) population to estimate the impact of CPAP on the primary endpoint. For the on
treatment (OT) analysis, a time-dependent Cox model (20, 21)) was used to estimate the

impact of CPAP usage on the primary endpoint. This approach accounts for the time-varying

character of the intervention because subject follow-up is split into multiple intervals

according to the visit dates of the CPAP usage evaluation. Originally, visits were planned

after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months and then annually until the end of the study. Incomplete usage data

due to missed visits were replaced as follows: one missing episode was replaced by the last

observation, if the missing episode was followed by a visit. Two or more subsequent missing

visits were replaced by 0. If the data from the first visit after one month were missing, they

were replaced by the usage data of the 3-month visit. Multivariate adjustment was made for

CPAP nights/period and baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), age, gender, AHI,

body mass index (BMI), current smoking, revascularization type, former revascularization,

acute MI, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and lung disease.

**Sample Size Estimation**

At the time of the study start in 2005, available literature suggested that the incidence rate for

a combination of cardiovascular mortality, acute myocardial infarction and the need for a new

revascularization within a year of PCI was 27% (22). Moreover, in a systemic review of the

comparative effectiveness of PCI and CABG, the 5-year repeat revascularization rate was

reported to be 40.1% in PCI with stents and 9.8% in CABG patients (23). There were no

studies in revascularized patients with CAD and concomitant OSA prior to 2005 to accurately

inform estimates of study power for the primary outcome assessments; therefore, a composite


-----

endpoint rate of 25% in nonsleepy patients with untreated OSA over a 3-year follow-up

period was hypothesized. The RCT arm was designed to initially comprise a consecutive

sample of 200 patients with (100 nonsleepy OSA randomized to CPAP, 100 to no-CPAP). It

was assumed that approximately 25% of the OSA subjects would be noncompliant with

CPAP during the follow-up period. The trial was expected to have an 80% power to detect a

risk reduction in the rate of the composite endpoint from 25% to 10% on an ITT basis (p<0.05

level, two-sided test). An interim analysis blinded to randomization group performed in

February 2010 revealed an incident rate of 21%, and a CPAP adherence rate of 60% at 1 year,

resulting in a protocol amendment. As a result, using an enlarged sample size of 242 patients

(121 in each of the randomization arm) and an extended follow-up period of ≥2 years and ≤7

years, a significant risk reduction for the primary endpoint from 25% to 12% was

hypothesized.

#### Results

**Study Participants**

A total of 1259 patients met the inclusion criteria for screening, of whom 662 (52.7%) agreed

to participate in the sleep study (Figure 1). Diagnostic PG was performed at home after an

average of 63 days following mechanical revascularization (median 59 days; interquartile

range [IQR] 42-78), and patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the RCT or the

observational arm underwent baseline investigations on average 35 days (median 30; IQR 20
45) after home sleep recordings.

**Baseline Characteristics**

A total of 244 patients with CAD and OSA fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the randomized

controlled (RCT) arm. Nonsleepy OSA patients allocated to CPAP did not differ significantly


-----

from nonsleepy OSA patients allocated to no-CPAP with regard to demographic and clinical

characteristics (Table 1).

**Numbers Analyzed**

Median follow-up time until mortality, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study was 56.9

months (range 6.5–90.2). All patients were included in the ITT analysis for primary

outcomes; 16 patients died, and 1 was lost to follow-up (Figure 1). Of 244 patients with AHI

≥15/h on PG, 4 had AHI <5/h on in-hospital PSG the day before the RCT started, 19-54 days

after initial at-home PG. Follow-up data for these 4 patients are provided in eTable 1 in the

online data supplement), and correlations between AHI values on PG vs PSG for the OSA

group are shown in eFigure 1 in the online data supplement. Of OSA patients allocated to

CPAP at baseline, 49 returned the device within 2 years. Of the nonsleepy OSA patients

randomized to no-CPAP, 3 wanted to start CPAP at baseline, and 22 during the amended

follow-up period due to reaching the nonfatal endpoints and/or completing the initial 3-year

follow-up, or developing daytime sleepiness. CPAP compliance data from CPAP devices are

shown in eTable 2 in the online data supplement.

**Outcomes**

_Intention-to-treat_

Overall, 49 patients reached the combined endpoint during follow-up, and 22 (18.1%) in the

CPAP group, and 27 (22.1%) in the no-CPAP group (not significant). The incidence of the

composite endpoint was 4.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.56–4.73) per 100 person-years;

4.18 (95% CI 2.75-6.35) per 100 person-years in CPAP group vs 5.21 (95% CI 3.57-7.60) per

100 person-years in no-CPAP group, respectively (P=0.449). Cumulative incidences of the

primary endpoint are illustrated in Figure 2. There were no significant differences in the


-----

individual incidences of the endpoints in the PCI and CABG subgroups (see eTable 3 in the

online data supplement). Univariate predictors of adverse outcomes were diabetes mellitus

and former revascularization, while CABG at baseline was protective (Table 2). On

multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio [HR] 2.05; 95% CI 1.06–3.98; P=0.034)

and former revascularization (HR 3.29; 95% CI 1.77–6.10; P<0.001) were significantly

associated with increased risk for the composite endpoint whereas CABG at baseline (HR

0.30; 95% CI 0.12–0.75; P<0.001) was associated with reduced risk (Table 2).

_On-treatment_

There was no significant difference in incidence rates between the groups when applying a

cut-off level of 3 hours of CPAP usage per night, but there was a significant between-group

difference based on CPAP usage for ≥4 hours/night (6 events) vs <4 hours/night or no-CPAP

(43 events) with an HR 0.29 and 95% CI 0.10–0.86 with covariable adjustments (Table 3).

The incidence of the composite endpoint was 2.31 (95% CI 0.96-5.54) per 100 person-years

for CPAP usage for ≥4 hours/night, and 5.32 (95% CI 3.96-7.15) per 100 person-years for

CPAP usage <4 hours/night or no CPAP.

**Adverse Events**

One patient (age 81 years) with CAD and mechanical aortic valve prosthesis, who was on

combination therapy with warfarin and clopidogrel after PCI, could not use the CPAP device

due to frequent nasal bleeding on treatment. This patient restarted CPAP therapy without any

nasal bleeding when clopidogrel was discontinued 3 years after PCI. Other patient-reported

side effects during CPAP fitted with the known tolerability profile of CPAP, and included dry

mouth, nasal symptoms, claustrophobia, insomnia, noise problems, and mask fit.

#### Discussion

This study showed that routine prescription of CPAP to patients with CAD and nonsleepy

OSA did not significantly reduce the long-term cardiovascular event rate. A significant

beneficial effect of CPAP was seen first after adjusting for baseline comorbidities and CPAP

adherence.

To our knowledge, this is the first RCT investigating the effect of CPAP on long-term

cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD and concomitant OSA without daytime

sleepiness. Two RCTs are currently underway investigating the impact of CPAP on long-term

outcomes in larger cohorts with established cardiovascular disease (24, 25). Many previous

studies that showed beneficial effects of CPAP in patients with CAD and OSA had an

observational design. A review of 371 patients with OSA and CAD who underwent PCI

reported a significantly lower 5-year cardiac death rate (3%) among 175 patients treated with

CPAP compared with 196 untreated patients (10%) (10). Data from a sleep clinic cohort,

demonstrated that CPAP treatment significantly reduced cardiovascular risk in men with

severe OSA (26). Similarly, adequate CPAP treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of a

composite endpoint of incident CAD or stroke in women with OSA (27). Moreover, after

adjustment for confounding factors, post-MI patients with OSA who were compliant with

CPAP had a lower risk of recurrent MI and repeat revascularization than untreated patients,

and similar to patients without OSA (28).

In this RCT, CPAP treatment of CAD and nonsleepy OSA patients did not significantly

reduce the rate of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. These results may reflect the fact that

getting nonsleepy patients to comply with CPAP is challenging. Between-group differences at

baseline may also have influenced the findings. Randomization was not stratified by

comorbidities, and there was a higher proportion of patients with acute MI, diabetes mellitus

and hypertension in the CPAP arm. OT analysis showed that CPAP was effective in


-----

nonsleepy patients who used the device for ≥4 hours per night, with an adjusted HR that was

of similar magnitude to that reported in a previous observational study.[27]

Many CAD patients with OSA do not experience daytime sleepiness, and it has been

suggested that nonsleepy OSA patients might have poor CPAP adherence because they don’t

experience subjective benefits from therapy (29). This may be the case, although overall

adherence in the current CAD population did not differ markedly from long-term adherence

rates in sleep clinic cohorts (30). Indeed, an observational study of a sleep clinic cohort with

CAD suggested comparable adherence to CPAP in sleepy and nonsleepy patients (31), and a

larger RCT addressing the impact of CPAP treatment on incident hypertension or

cardiovascular events in nonsleepy OSA patients from sleep clinics reported that 64% of

patients were using CPAP for ≥4 hours/night after a median 4-year follow-up (32).

The results of the current study suggest that CPAP treatment is feasible in CAD populations

with nonsleepy OSA, given the additional assumption that such high-risk patients might

expect greater cardiovascular benefits, and may be more motivated to comply with treatment

despite the lack of daytime sleepiness. However, initial data from the SAVE trial suggest a

lower CPAP compliance rate than in this study, despite an initial 1-week run-in phase with

sham-CPAP to exclude noncompliant patients before randomization (15% of all eligible

patients were excluded) (33). Thus, adherence remains a challenging issue when evaluating

the cardiovascular benefits of CPAP treatment in patients with CAD and concomitant OSA

without daytime sleepiness. Also, the finding that CPAP use for ≥4 hours/night is required to

achieve cardiovascular benefits in nonsleepy OSA patients is similar to the results of a

previous post-hoc analysis (32).

CPAP is not the only treatment option for OSA. In a recent RCT, adherence to a weight loss

regimen and CPAP resulted in incremental BP reductions compared with either intervention

alone (34). There is also accumulating evidence for a beneficial impact of mandibular


-----

advancement devices on BP in OSA patients (35, 36). Moreover, given the emergence of new

mechanical and pharmacological interventions in sleep medicine (37), improved

“personalization” of OSA therapy may be possible through better characterization of

individual patient pathophysiology.

Despite the lack of conclusive evidence for a beneficial effect of CPAP in the current trial, the

high prevalence of OSA in the entire study population (19) indicates that OSA should be

considered when assessing the impact of different treatments (e.g. lipid-lowering agents, bare
metal versus drug-eluting stents) in revascularized CAD cohorts. Effective treatment of OSA

with CPAP, or other approaches, is challenging in CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA, but

needs to be evaluated in secondary prevention models.

The strengths of this study include its randomized controlled design for patients with CAD

and nonsleepy OSA with only 1 lost to follow-up. Although the inclusion rate for eligible

patients for sleep screening was only 53%, the inclusion design was consecutive, and there

were no significant differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing versus not

undergoing sleep study (19).

This study also had a number of limitations. Firstly, it was a single-center trial with two sites,

which limits generalizability of results across geographic regions. Secondly, “nonsleepy”

OSA relied on an ESS threshold, which may not reflect an objective sleepiness. However, this

is a generally accepted tool for subjective daytime sleepiness, and other methods such as

Multiple Sleep Latency Test (38), which is used as an objective tool, is time consuming and

not feasible to run for the large-scale cardiac populations. Thirdly, the study was

underpowered for the ITT arm for several reasons: CPAP adherence in patients with CAD and

nonsleepy OSA was lower than initially expected, which possibly resulted in an inadequately

powered sample size estimation. While CPAP adherence rates were slightly higher than those

reported in the SAVE trial (33), those data had not been published when the current study


-----

started or when the interim analysis was performed. Further, revascularized CAD patients

were a heterogeneous group, including both PCI and CABG, and both acute/subacute and

elective PCI,.and the apparent treatment effect was far smaller than anticipated due to an

optimistic first assumption. Fourthlythe trial was open-label, and had no placebo control arm.

As previously discussed (39), there is no true sham CPAP or other appropriate placebo for

CPAP in a long-term trial in cardiovascular disease patients. It is also possible that sham

CPAP consisting of a mask attached to tubing, but without pressure application, would

worsen sleep disturbance and act as a “negative placebo” (40). Finally, results of the OT

analysis must be interpreted with care because device usage is patient-driven and self
selection bias cannot be excluded.

In conclusion, routine CPAP prescription of CPAP to CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA did

not significantly reduce long-term adverse outcomes. However, the study may have had

limited power to detect a significant difference in the ITT population. The risk reduction was

observed first after adjustment for baseline comorbidities and CPAP adherence. These

findings need to be further explored in larger clinical cohorts with more homogenous CAD

populations.

##### Methods

 Study design and patients

 Patients were recruited from two hospitals with training and research facilities serving a

 population of approximately 250,000 living in the Skaraborg County of West Götaland, Sweden.

 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed either as an elective or acute/subacute

 procedure at the hospital in Skövde or at the Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg,

 which is the regional hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in

 Gothenburg, and all patients were moved to the study hospitals in Skövde or Lidköping when

 clinically stable after revascularization. Eligible patients who gave informed consent to

 participate in the study were referred to the Sleep Medicine Unit for sleep studies.

 Sleep recordings

 Cardiorespiratory polygraphy at home

 The portable, limited polygraphy (PG) sleep study performed with the Embletta[®] PDS (Portable

 Digital System) device (Embla, Broomfield, CO, USA), consisted of the following: 1) nasal

 pressure detector using nasal cannulae/pressure transducer system, recording the square root of

 pressure as an index of flow; 2) thoraco-abdominal movement detection through two

 XactTrace™ inductive belts with respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) technology; 3)

 finger pulse oximeter detecting heart rate and oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2); and 4) body

 position and movement detection. The patient's sleep time was estimated on the basis of self
 reporting as well as the pattern of body movement during the sleep study. Patients with an

 estimated sleep time of <4 hours were offered a new home-based sleep study. Apneas were

 defined as an almost complete (≥90%) cessation of airflow. Hypopneas were defined as a ≥50%

2


-----

##### reduction in thoracoabdominal movement and/or a ≥50% decrease in the nasal pressure

 amplitude for ≥10 seconds (E1, E2). In addition, the total number of significant oxyhemoglobin

 desaturations (decrease of ≥4% from the immediately preceding baseline) were scored, and the

 oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was calculated as the number of significant desaturations per

 hour of estimated sleep. Events with a ≥30% reduction in thoracoabdominal movement and/or a

 ≥50% decrease in the nasal pressure amplitude for ≥10 seconds were also scored as hypopneas if

 there was a significant desaturation (≥4%). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 per

 hour of estimated sleep time, independent of symptom occurrence, were defined as having OSA.

 All baseline screening recordings were scored by the same observer (YP). 

 Overnight polysomnography in hospital 

 All patients with CAD and a diagnosis of OSA based on the first PG screening investigation

 underwent unattended overnight polysomnography (PSG) in hospital using a computerized

 recording system (Embla A10[®], Embla, Broomfield, CO, USA) for the comparison between

 sleepy versus non-sleepy OSA phenotypes as one of the secondary analyses (E3). The PSG

 system included sleep monitoring through three-channel electroencephalography (EEG [C4/A1,

 C3/A2, CZ/A1]), two-channel electrooculography (EOG), one-channel submental

 electromyography (EMG), bilateral tibial EMG and two-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in

 addition to the cardiorespiratory channels as described for the Embletta system above. PSG

 recordings were scored based on 30-second epochs according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales

 criteria (E4) by an observer blinded to clinical data and baseline screening results from the

 previous PG recordings. Obstructive events on the PSGs were scored according to the same

 AASM criteria applied for the PGs (E1). CAD patients without OSA on PG did not undergo

 overnight PSG in hospital because AHI values of <5/h on the PG system used have been shown

3


-----

##### to reliably exclude OSA (E5).

 Epworth Sleepiness Scale

 Excessive daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)

 questionnaire (E6). The ESS contains eight questions to evaluate the chance of dozing off under

 eight scenarios in the past month. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 for would never doze, 1 for

 slight chance of dozing, 2 for moderate chance of dozing, and 3 for high chance of dozing). The

 ESS score ranges from 0 to 24. Excessive daytime sleepiness was defined as an ESS score of

 ≥10.

 Baseline assessments 

 Venous blood samples were drawn between 07.00 and 08.00 hours in the morning following

 overnight PSG, after a fast of ≥10 hours, for determination of secondary endpoints as described

 previously (E3). Other assessments included quality of life questionnaires and echocardiographic

 investigations at baseline before the start of the randomized controlled trial (RCT) period (E3).

 Group assignment, randomization, interventions, and follow-up 

 Group assignment was based on the cardiorespiratory PG recordings. In hospital PSG for OSA

 patients the day before start of the RCT was mainly planned for subsequent studies of further

 evaluation of sleep architecture in different OSA phenotypes as well as for comparison with the

 baseline PG recordings (E3). Scoring of the PSGs was done later during the follow-up period and

 group allocation was not changed on the basis of these results. The 1:1 random assignment of

4


-----

##### patients with CAD and nonsleepy OSA was scheduled by the sealed envelope system with a

 block size of eight patients (four CPAP, four controls) stratified by gender and revascularization

 type (PCI/CABG). Thus, 4 groups of sealed envelopes (8 in each group; a. PCI-men; b. PCI
 women; c. CABG-men; d. CABG-women) were prepared in advance by the investigator (YP)

 and the study nurse, and the patients were enrolled in the randomization procedure in the morning

 after overnight PSG, which was scheduled by the study nurse with no knowledge about the

 details of the patient characteristics and comorbidity data. The patients allocated to CPAP

 treatment were informed about the technical procedure in the morning after overnight PSG and

 provided with an automatic (self-titrating) CPAP device (S8[®], or S9[®]; ResMed, Sydney,

 Australia) and a nasal or full-face mask and humidifier by trained staff at the study center. All

 participants assigned to CPAP were instructed to use the device at home every night for ≥4 hours,

 contacted by telephone after one week and given a check-up in the clinic after 1 month, 3 months,

 6 months, 1 year, and then yearly to end of the main study. Nonsleepy OSA patients who were

 randomized to the control group and who were obese were given advice about weight reduction,

 and all OSA patients randomized to no-CPAP were informed about the tennis ball technique to

 avoid the supine position during sleep (E7). All patients were evaluated at 3, 6, and 12 months,

 and annually thereafter, and were given standard cardiology treatment by their physicians. A new

 PG sleep recording was performed in all patients at 3 and 12 months, and annually thereafter

 (with CPAP in treated OSA patients) as part of a planned future post-hoc analysis comparing

 reports from the PG device regarding residual AHI and pressures applied during CPAP treatment,

 and for analysis of the natural course of OSA in patients who were randomized to no-CPAP.

5


-----

##### Adherence to CPAP

 OSA patients receiving CPAP treatment brought their device to the clinic at each scheduled

 follow-up visit; monitoring settings and hours of CPAP use were obtained from the machines’

 internal clocks and recorded. In addition, pressure level, mask leak and residual AHI measures

 were noted. All necessary adjustments of the CPAP device and mask fittings were done

 according to clinical routines by the sleep medicine unit staff. Patients who were unable to adhere

 to CPAP treatment were followed as part of the treatment arm as defined in the intention-to-treat

 (ITT) analysis. 

 Cardiovascular endpoint criteria 

 An Independent Clinical Event Committee (ICEC) reviewed all data obtained from hospital

 records and death certificates by the end of May 2013, blinded to personal identity and group

 allocation. The ICEC review was based on a previously described definition of the endpoints

 (E8), which was applied in the HOT study (E9), and other trials. In summary, overall mortality

 was based on the death certificate. Cardiovascular mortality was defined as death from any of the

 following: myocardial infarction, stroke (cerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction), ruptured

 aortic aneurysm (thoracic or abdominal), heart failure (as determined by the treating physician),

 sudden death with no cause other than presumed cardiac (malignant arrhythmias), death during or

 within 28 days of CABG or PCI, and pulmonary embolism. Myocardial infarction was defined as

 ≥2 of the following signs/symptoms: sudden chest pain and/or sudden shortness of breath and/or

 syncope; new left bundle branch block or new ST-elevation or transient ST- or T-wave changes;

 increase of troponin I levels to >0.10 µg/L in ≥2 samples or increases in myocardial necrosis

 biomarkers (other causes of troponin elevation should be excluded). Evidence of myocardial

6


-----

##### infarction at autopsy could also be used as a single criterion. Stroke was defined as sudden onset

 of focal neurological signs lasting >24 hours (other causes such as brain tumor, subdural or

 epidural hematoma, subarachnoid haemorrhage, psychosomatic, peripheral nerve lesions should

 be excluded). Stroke was defined as cerebral hemorrhage if computed tomography (CT) or

 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed intracerebral blood, and as cerebral

 infarction if early CT brain was normal and subsequent follow-up was compatible with stroke, or

 if later CT brain or MRI showed signs of infarction; or, as a single criterion, evidence of cerebral

 haemorrhage or infarction at autopsy and determined by the pathologist as the cause of death.

 CABG was defined as an operation with grafts to coronary arteries, and PCI was defined as

 dilatation of the coronary arteries with or without stents. Pulmonary embolism was defined

 sudden onset of chest pain and/or shortness of breath and/or syncope together with typical CT

 findings of the pulmonary arteries or pulmonary scintigraphy. Aortic aneurysm (either thoracic or

 abdominal) was defined as all 3 of: sudden onset of chest pain or abdominal pain; typical findings

 on chest or abdominal radiography or ultrasound; need for intervention (blood pressure treatment,

 or surgery, or percutaneous transluminal intervention with or without stent). Acute hospital

 admissions for cardiovascular reasons included myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary

 embolism, aortic aneurysm (as defined above) as well as acute hospital admissions for heart

 failure, transient ischemic attacks, chest pain of presumed cardiac origin (e.g. angina pectoris),

 peripheral emboli, atrial fibrillation and other cardiac arrhythmias, and intermittent claudication.

7


-----

##### Data collection and analysis

 The primary outcome variables were documented prospectively and were not subject to observer

 bias. Baseline comorbidity data, results of sleep recordings, and CPAP compliance data were

 prospectively recorded in separate files at a specific server of the study hospital by research

 personnel blinded to study group allocation and/or unaware of the study outcomes. 

 Results

 Comparison between home PG and in-hospital PSG

 All OSA patients underwent unattended overnight PSG in hospital after baseline

 cardiorespiratory PG recordings (median 29 days, range 5-146 days). The mean total sleep time

 (TST) recorded during PSG was 372±92 minutes compared with 424±63 minutes estimated sleep

 time during cardiorespiratory PG (P<0.001). Moreover, time spent on supine position was

 30.7±25.3% on home PG, and 35.7±27.8% on PSG (P=0.011). Average AHI values were, as

 expected, higher (40.4±22.9/h) on PSG compared with those on PG (28.9±13.3/h; P<0.001)

 because home PGs usually underestimate AHI due to recording time exceeding actual sleep time.

 As illustrated in eFigure 1, there was a linear correlation between AHI values based on PG vs.

 PSG (r=0.528; P<0.001). On the other hand, among patients who had an AHI ≥15/h on home
 based PG, 23 had mild OSA (AHI ≥5 to <15/h), and 4 no OSA (AHI<5/h) according to PSG.

 However, the repeated PG recordings and data from the CPAP devices in treated patients were

 supportive of the initial group allocation (eTable 1).
