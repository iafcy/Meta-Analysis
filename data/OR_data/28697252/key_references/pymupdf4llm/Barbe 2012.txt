**Context Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for pa-**
tients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, its indication for all
patients with sleep-disordered breathing, regardless of daytime symptoms, is unclear.

**Objective To evaluate the effect of CPAP treatment on the incidence of hyperten-**
sion or cardiovascular events in a cohort of nonsleepy patients with OSA.

**Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, parallel-group, randomized con-**
trolled trial in 14 teaching hospitals in Spain. Between May 2004 and May 2006, 725
consecutive patients were enrolled who had an apnea-hypopnea index of 20 h[−1] or
greater and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 10 or less (scores range from 0-24,
with values �10 suggesting no daytime sleepiness). Exclusion criteria were previous
cardiovascular event, physical or psychological incapacity, chronic disease, or drug or
alcohol addiction. Follow-up ended in May 2009.

**Intervention Patients were allocated to receive CPAP treatment or no active inter-**
vention. All participants received dietary counseling and sleep hygiene advice.

**Main Outcome Measures Incidence of either systemic hypertension (taking an-**
tihypertensive medication or blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) or cardiovascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack,
hospitalization for unstable angina or arrhythmia, heart failure, or cardiovascular death).

**Results Seven hundred twenty-three patients underwent follow-up for a median of 4**
(interquartile range, 2.7-4.4) years (1 patient from each group did not receive allocated
treatment); 357 in the CPAP group and 366 in the control group were included in the
analysis. In the CPAP group there were 68 patients with new hypertension and 28 cardiovascular events (17 unstable angina or arrhythmia, 3 nonfatal stroke, 3 heart failure,
2 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 transient ischemic attack, 1 cardiovascular death). In
the control group there were 79 patients with new hypertension and 31 cardiovascular
events (11 unstable angina or arrhythmia, 8 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 5 transient
ischemic attack, 5 heart failure, 2 nonfatal stroke). The hypertension or cardiovascular
event incidence density rate was 9.20 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 7.36-11.04) in
the CPAP group and 11.02 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 8.96-13.08) in the control
group. The incidence density ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.63-1.1; P=.20).

**Conclusions In patients with OSA without daytime sleepiness, the prescription of**
CPAP compared with usual care did not result in a statistically significant reduction in
the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events. However, the study may have
had limited power to detect a significant difference.

sion,[3,4] andOSAhasbeenassociatedwith
cardiovascular diseases,[5-7] although this
association is attenuated in some studies when adjusted for age and obesity.[8]
Continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) acts as a pneumatic splint to the
upper airway during sleep and corrects
the obstruction, improving daytime
sleepiness and quality of life in patients
withOSA.[9] Also,CPAPtreatmentcanreduce blood pressure in these patients.[10]
ObservationalstudiessuggestthatCPAP
treatment reduces the incidence of fatal
andnonfatalcardiovasculareventsinpatientswithsevere[11] andmoderate[12] OSA.
However,noneofthesestudieswererandomized. To perform such studies in
symptomatic patients would be unethical because available evidence of the effectiveness of CPAP on symptom control and accident risk precludes the
possibility of withholding treatment in
a long-term study. The indication for
CPAP treatment in nonsleepy patients is
under debate. Two short-term randomized controlled trials have shown no effectofCPAPonbloodpressureandclinical variables in nonsleepy patients with
OSA.[13,14] Nonetheless, because of the
high incidence of cardiovascular complicationsinpatientswithOSA,someauthors advocate the long-term use of
CPAP treatment for all patients with
sleep-disorderedbreathing,regardlessof
daytime symptoms.[15]

The primary objective of this study
was to evaluate the effect of CPAP treatment on the incidence of hypertension
or cardiovascular events in a cohort of
nonsleepy patients with OSA. We studied this composite outcome because hypertension and cardiovascular events
have been associated with OSA, they
sharerelatedpathologicalpathways,and
their clinical relevance has been established.[16] The secondary objective was to
evaluate the relationship between OSA
severity and the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events.

**METHODS**
**Setting and Participants**
Recruitment took place in 14 Spanish
teaching hospitals between May 2004
and May 2006. Follow-up ended in May


2009. Patients were referred to sleep
units for evaluation of observed apneas or snoring. The study was approved by the ethics committee of each
participating center, and patients provided written informed consent.
Patients were eligible if they were between 18 and 70 years old, showed 20
or more apneas plus hypopneas per
hour (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) in
an overnight sleep study, and had no
daytime hypersomnolence, defined as
an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score
of 10 or lower (ESS scores have a range
of 0-24). The exclusion criteria were
physical or psychological incapacity,
any previous cardiovascular event,
chronic disease, drug or alcohol addiction, chronic intake of hypnotics, or refusal to participate in the study. Patients with a history of hypertension
were not excluded.
The OSA diagnosis was made using
a conventional polysomnographic or
cardiorespiratory sleep study. The cardiorespiratory study included, at minimum, continuous recording from nasal cannulae, thoracic-abdominal
motion, oxygen saturation, and body
position. Results from all sleep studies
were analyzed by trained personnel at
each participating center, using standard criteria. An apnea was defined as
an absence of airflow of 10 seconds or
longer and a hypopnea as an airflow reduction (�50%) lasting 10 seconds or
longer with a greater than 4% decrease in oxygen saturation. Obstructive apneas were defined as the absence of airflow in the presence of chest
or abdominal wall motion. The AHI was
calculated based on the average number of apnea plus hypopnea episodes
per hour of sleep or recording time.

**Randomization, Blinding,**
**and Intervention**
Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive CPAP
treatment or no active intervention.
Randomization was performed using a
computer-generated list of random
numbers in the coordinating center and
was stratified by center. The results
were mailed in numbered opaque en

velopes. The coordinating center saved
a sealed copy of the randomization list
sent to each center. Blood pressures and
all cardiovascular events were assessed objectively by personnel not involved in the study and blinded to patient allocation. Patients, researchers,
and the statistician were not blinded to
patient allocation.
CPAP titration was performed using
conventional polysomnography or an
autoCPAP device following a validated protocol.[17] CPAP adherence was
measured using the machines’ internal clocks. All participants received
sleep hygiene advice and dietary counseling for weight loss from the staff of
the sleep units. There was no specific
weight loss program, and patients were
referred to their general practitioner to
monitor weight loss.

**Outcomes and Follow-up**
The primary outcome was the incidence of either systemic hypertension
(among participants who were normotensive at baseline) or cardiovascular
events (among all participants). The
secondary outcome was the association between the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events and the
severity of OSA assessed by the AHI and
oxygen saturation.
Informationregardingmedicationuse,
OSA severity, sleepiness (ESS score),
blood pressure, a basic biochemical assessment, and results of electrocardiography were recorded for each patient at
inclusion. Cardiovascular events included nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatalstroke,transientischemicattack,
hospitalizationforunstableanginaorarrhythmia, heart failure, and cardiovascular death. All cardiovascular events
were identified by a cardiologist or neurologist not involved in the study and
blinded to the patients’ randomization
status. Hypertension was defined as takingantihypertensivemedicationorblood
pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg.
Bloodpressuremeasurementsweretaken
by experienced nurses, following international guidelines.[18]
Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, and
12 months and annually thereafter. The

ences between hospitals in quantitative baseline variables.
The secondary outcome of the study
was to assess the association between
the incidence of cardiovascular events
or hypertension and disease severity. To
assess this association, we tested the interaction of severity variables (AHI and
time with arterial oxygen saturation

[SaO2] �90%, dichotomized into 2
groups based on their median values)
with the intervention in a Poisson regression model, with the outcome variable being the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events.
Differences between baseline values and the mean area under the curve
for BMI and ESS score in follow-up visits were calculated for each patient.
These differences were compared between intervention groups using the
Mann-Whitney nonparametric test.

**RESULTS**
A total of 725 patients were randomized, with 357 in the CPAP group and
366 in the control group analyzed
(FIGURE 1). Baseline variables were
comparable between the CPAP and control groups, with the exception of AHI
and time with SaO2 less than 90%. Fifty
percent of the sample was hypertensive at inclusion (TABLE 1). Many of the
baseline variables had site-specific differences (eTable 1, available at http:
//www.jama.com).
Follow-up time until a cardiovascular event, loss to follow-up, or the end
of the study ranged from 0 to 5.38 years,
with a median of 4.0 years (interquartile range [IQR], 2.7-4.4 years). There
were no significant differences in median follow-up between groups using
the Mann-Whitney test (4.01 years

[IQR, 3.01-4.37] for the CPAP group
vs 3.96 years [IQR, 2.19-4.38] for the
control group; P =.13).

**Primary Outcome: Effects of CPAP**
**on the Incidence of Hypertension**
**or Cardiovascular Events**
A total of 147 patients with new hypertension and 59 cardiovascular events
wereidentified.IntheCPAPgroup,there
were 68 patients with new hyperten

study was designed to follow up patients for at least 3 years. However, follow-up for the main outcome was
stopped when the patients developed
new-onset hypertension or experienced a cardiovascular event, withdrew informed consent, were unable to
complete follow-up, or when there was
a change from control group to CPAP
treatment. Exposure time was defined
as the time between randomization and
first cardiovascular event or newonset hypertension, date of death, date
of the last study visit, date of withdrawal, or loss to follow-up.
At each visit a physician recorded cardiovascular events, blood pressure, ESS
score, weight, CPAP adherence, medications, alcohol and tobacco consumption,andotherclinicallyrelevantevents.

**Sample Size**
The sample size was calculated assumingthattheincidenceofhypertensionor
new cardiovascular event in this population over a period of 3 years would be
10%annually.Thisestimationwasbased
on published studies[19] and data provided by the Spanish National Epidemiology Center. We estimated that CPAP
would reduce the incidence of new hypertension or cardiovascular events by
60% based on a cohort study by Marin
etal[11] thatshowedacardiovascularevent
rate of 2.13 per 100 person-years in an
untreated group vs 0.64 per 100 personyears in a group of patients treated with
CPAP, a 70% relative rate reduction. We
assumed �=.05, �=.10, 2-sided significance testing, and 10% study dropout.
Under these assumptions, the study
would need to enroll a total of 345 patients per group.

**Statistical Analysis**
Data were stored in a web-based application. R version 2.10.1 was used for
all analyses. Estimated means for treatmentadherence,bodymassindex(BMI,
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and
ESS scores during the follow-up period were computed individually for
each patient as the area under the curve
obtained from the values reported in fol

low-up visits, taking into account the
time between visits and the last available information.
Mann-Whitney tests (or t tests if data
were normally distributed) and Pearson �[2] tests with a Yates continuity correction (or Fisher exact tests if expected frequencies were less than 5)
were used for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, when comparing the CPAP and control groups.
The effect of the CPAP intervention was
assessed as an incidence density ratio
(IDR) of hypertension or cardiovascular events, and significance was assessed using the Wald test. A modified intention-to-treat approach was
used, in which all patients receiving the
allocated intervention were included in
the analysis of the primary outcome.
For modeling incidence, a Poisson regression model was used and adjusted
for intervention group. An additional
analysisincludingrandomhospital(site)
effect was performed because of the hospital imbalances in baseline variables. A
goodness-of-fit test for the assumption
of a Poisson distribution was performed in every adjusted model to determine if a negative binomial model
should be used instead. The use of a Cox
proportional hazards regression model
wasnotpossiblebecausethedatadidnot
satisfytheproportionalhazardsassumption.[20] Available information was used
with no need for imputation.
The cumulative incidence, CI(t), of
events at time t was estimated using the
incidence density at that time, ID(t), in
the equation CI(t)=1−exp{−ID(t)*t}.
Therefore, each point of the graph
shows the cumulative incidence after
t years of follow-up in the study, expressed as a percentage. A post hoc
analysis was performed to assess a possible dose-response relationship. For
this analysis, the CPAP group was partitioned based on whether the mean
CPAP adherence during follow-up was
less than 4 hours.[11] The outcomes in
each of these CPAP subgroups were
compared with those in the control
group. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum
test was used to analyze the doseresponse relationship as well as differ

Disease severity was assessed using AHI
and time with SaO2 less than 90%. The


effect of CPAP on the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events
with reference to the control group

is reported in the supplementary online content. When assessed separately, CPAP did not show any statistically significant effect on the incidence
of new cardiovascular events (eTable 2,
eTable 3, and eFigure 1) or on newonset hypertension (eTable 4, eTable
5, and eFigure 2).
There were 8 deaths in the CPAP
group and 3 in the control group. The
IDR for death was 2.6 (95% CI, 0.7011.8; P =.16). Of the patients assigned
to CPAP, 5 died of cancer, 1 of cardiovascular causes, 1 of trauma, and another of unknown causes. Among controls, the causes of death were cancer
for 2 and unknown for 1.
Decreases in BMI were significantly
greater in the control group than in the
CPAP group, with a significant difference of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.04-0.46; P=.02)
(eTable 6). Both groups had changes in
ESS scores, but these changes were significantly less in the control group than
in the CPAP group (0.2 vs 1.3;
_P_ �.001), with a significant difference
of −1.1 (95% CI, −1.4 to −0.7; P�.001)
(eTable 7).

**COMMENT**
This study suggests that in patients with
OSAandwithoutdaytimesleepiness,the
prescription of CPAP compared with
usual care did not result in a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events. However, a larger study or
longer follow-up might have been able
to identify a significant association between treatment and outcome. A post
hoc analysis suggested that CPAP treatment may reduce the incidence of hypertensionorcardiovasculareventsinpatients with CPAP adherence of 4 h/night
or longer. The disease severity assessed
by the AHI and time with SaO2 less than
90% was not related to the incidence of
hypertension or cardiovascular events.
However, patients with worse oxygen
saturation at night and with CPAP adherence of less than 4 h/night showed a
higher rate of hypertension or cardiovascular events than the control group.
Compelling evidence indicates that
severe OSA is associated with an in

creased incidence of hypertension, cardiovascular events, or sudden death
during sleep.[4,6,7,21] Three systematic reviews,[22-24] 4 meta-analyses including 21
randomized controlled trials,[10,25-27] and
3 recent studies[28-30] have evaluated the

nonsleepy patients have shown no effect of CPAP on clinical symptoms or
blood pressure,[13,14] and a long-term
study showed a mild beneficial effect
of CPAP on blood pressure only in patients who used CPAP for 5.6 h/night
or longer.[28] In our study, the protective association of CPAP use with the
incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events in the subgroup of patients with adherence of 4 h/night or
longer was seen despite that subgroup
being more obese and having a higher
prevalence of hypertension. However,
the results of post hoc analyses should
be interpreted with caution and considered hypothesis generating. In these
analyses, patients were not randomized to the subgroups, and findings may
have resulted from a confounding bias,
such as the healthy-user effect (eg, adherent CPAP users may be more likely
to be adherent with other medications, treatments, exercise, nutrition, or
other health maintenance).
It has been postulated that nonsleepy patients treated with CPAP will
probably have poor adherence. Our results do not support this statement and
show that CPAP treatment is feasible
in this population, even in the absence of any specific reinforcement. An
unexpected finding was the relatively
high number of deaths during follow

on cardiovascular events is less definitive. Peker et al[31] reported a significant increase in the incidence of cardiovasculardiseaseamongincompletely
treated patients with OSA compared to
those who were efficiently treated. Several authors[11,12,32,33] have reported an improvement in long-term survival associated with treatment in different
cohorts of patients with OSA. Marin et
al[11] followed up a male cohort of treated
and untreated patients with OSA, snorers, and the general population for 10
years in an observational study. They
showed that CPAP treatment was associated with a lower risk of fatal and
nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients with severe OSA when compared with patients who refused CPAP
treatment. The incidence of cardiovascular events in patients receiving CPAP
treatment was not different from that


in the general population or in nonapneic snorers. Overall, observational
studies suggest a protective effect of
CPAP treatment on cardiovascular
events in patients with OSA.
In a post hoc analysis in our study,
CPAP was effective in patients who used
the treatment for more than 4 h/night.
Even in these patients, the magnitude
of the effect was less than in previous
observational studies.[11] In the study by
Marin et al,[11] the group treated with
CPAP had an event rate of 0.64 per 100
person-years, whereas the event rate in
our treatment group was 2.08 per 100
person-years (eTable 2). These results
are not unexpected, because randomized trials often show smaller positive
effects than observational studies.
Another possible explanation is that
CPAP is less effective in nonsleepy patients. Short-term studies focusing on

up. The study sample size was not large
enough to reach a conclusion about any
relationship to treatment, but this issue deserves further research.
The strengths of our study include
its multicentric design and the generalizability of the trial findings. Baseline cardiovascular risk factors were not
different between groups, and median
follow-up time was similar. Nevertheless, this study has several potential
limitations.
First, the lack of effect of CPAP
on hypertension or cardiovascular
events could be related to an inadequately powered estimation of the
sample size. The lack of previous
studies suitable for sample size calculation contributed to the difficulty of
sample size estimation. The potential
protective effect of CPAP was probably overestimated, and a larger
study or longer follow-up might have
been able to identify a significant
association between treatment and
outcome. Including patients with
hypertension also might have contributed to a lack of study power,
because these patients could not
develop 1 component of the combined primary end point, incident
hypertension. Incident hypertension
accounted for more than two-thirds
of the primary end point events.
Second, medical research personnel
were not blinded to patient allocation. However, cardiovascular events
and blood pressure were assessed
objectively, by personnel not involved in the study and blinded to
patient allocation.
Third, at baseline the CPAP group
had higher AHI scores and slightly
greater time with SaO2 less than 90%.
These differences, although statistically significant, were likely to be of
little clinical relevance, because both
groups had severe OSA, and all other
characteristics and cardiovascular risk
factors were similar between the groups
at baseline. Fourth, blood pressure values were measured at clinic visits, an
approach that can be affected by the
white coat effect, observer bias, limited reproducibility, and the intrinsic

inaccuracy of the examiner’s auscultation technique. However, measurements were taken by experienced
nurses following international guidelines. Fifth, one possible explanation for
the smaller effect size of CPAP in this
trial compared with prior studies is that
the titration protocols may have been
less effective, resulting in an elevated
residual AHI on CPAP treatment. Although we do not know if this occurred, our CPAP titration protocol has
been validated in previous studies performed by our research group.[17]

In conclusion, in this study of patients with OSA without daytime sleepiness, the prescription of CPAP compared with usual care did not result in
a statistically significant reduction in the


incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events. However, the study
may have had limited power to detect
a significant difference. A post hoc
analysis suggested that CPAP treatment may reduce the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events in
patients with CPAP adherence of 4
h/night or longer.
