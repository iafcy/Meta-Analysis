Abstract
BACKGROUND—Central sleep apnea is associated with poor prognosis and death in patients
with heart failure. Adaptive servo-ventilation is a therapy that uses a noninvasive ventilator to treat
central sleep apnea by delivering servo-controlled inspiratory pressure support on top of
expiratory positive airway pressure. We investigated the effects of adaptive servo-ventilation in
patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly central sleep
apnea.
METHODS—We randomly assigned 1325 patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction of
45% or less, an apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) of 15 or more events (occurrences of apnea or
hypopnea) per hour, and a predominance of central events to receive guideline-based medical
treatment with adaptive servo-ventilation or guideline-based medical treatment alone (control).
The primary end point in the time-to-event analysis was the first event of death from any cause,
lifesaving cardiovascular intervention (cardiac transplantation, implantation of a ventricular assist
device, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, or appropriate lifesaving shock), or unplanned
hospitalization for worsening heart failure.

RESULTS—In the adaptive servo-ventilation group, the mean AHI at 12 months was 6.6 events
per hour. The incidence of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the adaptive
servo-ventilation group and the control group (54.1% and 50.8%, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.13;
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97 to 1.31; P = 0.10). All-cause mortality and cardiovascular
mortality were significantly higher in the adaptive servo-ventilation group than in the control
group (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.55; P = 0.01; and hazard
ratio for cardiovascular death, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.65; P = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS—Adaptive servo-ventilation had no significant effect on the primary end point
in patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly central sleep
apnea, but all-cause and cardiovascular mortality were both increased with this therapy.
Sleep-disordered breathing is common in patients who have heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction, with reported prevalence rates of 50 to 75%.1 Obstructive sleep apnea
occurs more often in patients with heart failure than in the general population. Central sleep
apnea, which may manifest as Cheyne–Stokes respiration, is found in 25 to 40% of patients
who have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.2 The prevalence of central sleep apnea
increases in parallel with increasing severity of heart failure1 and worsening cardiac
dysfunction.3
There are a number of mechanisms by which central sleep apnea may be detrimental to
cardiac function, including increased sympathetic nervous system activity and intermittent
hypoxemia.4–6 Central sleep apnea is an independent risk marker for poor prognosis and
death in patients with heart failure.4,7,8
In the Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Patients with Central Sleep Apnea
and Heart Failure (CANPAP) study, patients with heart failure and central sleep apnea were
randomly assigned to receive continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or no CPAP.9
The trial was stopped prematurely and did not show a beneficial effect of CPAP on
morbidity or mortality. A post hoc analysis suggested that mortality might be lower if the
apnea–hypopnea index (AHI; the number of occurrences of apnea or hypopnea per hour of
sleep) is reduced to less than 15 events per hour.10
Adaptive servo-ventilation is a noninvasive ventilatory therapy that effectively alleviates
central sleep apnea by delivering servo-controlled inspiratory pressure support on top of
expiratory positive airway pressure.11,12 The Treatment of Sleep-Disordered Breathing with
Predominant Central Sleep Apnea by Adaptive Servo Ventilation in Patients with Heart
Failure (SERVE-HF) trial investigated the effects of adding adaptive servoventilation
(AutoSet CS, ResMed) to guidelinebased medical treatment on survival and cardiovascular
outcomes in patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and predominantly
central sleep apnea.
METHODS
STUDY DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT
The SERVE-HF trial was an international, multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, event-
driven study. Information about the study design has been reported previously.13 The trial

was sponsored by ResMed. The study protocol, which is available with the full text of this
article at NEJM.org, was designed by the steering committee with the support of the
scientific advisory board and was approved by the ethics committee at each study center.
The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the
principles of the 2002 Declaration of Helsinki.
The steering committee oversaw the conduct of the trial and data analysis in collaboration
with the sponsor according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. The trial was reviewed
by an independent data and safety monitoring committee. The first draft of the manuscript
was prepared by the first three authors and the last author, who had unrestricted access to the
data, with the assistance of an independent medical writer funded by the sponsor. The
manuscript was reviewed and edited by all the authors. All the authors made the decision to
submit the manuscript for publication and assume responsibility for the accuracy and
completeness of the analyses and for the fidelity of this report to the trial protocol.
STUDY PATIENTS
Patients were eligible for participation in the study if they were 22 years of age or older and
had symptomatic chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Specific requirements
included a left ventricular ejection fraction of 45% or less, New York Heart Association
(NYHA) class III or IV heart failure or NYHA class II heart failure with at least one heart
failure–related hospitalization within the 24 months before randomization, and stable,
guideline-based medical treatment. Eligible participants also had predominantly central
sleep apnea (AHI, ≥15 events per hour, with >50% central events [apnea or hypopnea] and a
central AHI of ≥10 events per hour). Full details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are
provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org. All the participants
provided written informed consent.
INTERVENTION
Adjustment of adaptive servo-ventilation was performed in the hospital with the use of
polysomnographic or polygraphic monitoring. Default settings were used (expiratory
positive airway pressure, 5 cm of water; minimum pressure support, 3 cm of water; and
maximum pressure support, 10 cm of water). The expiratory positive airway pressure was
increased manually to control obstructive sleep apnea, and the maximum pressure support
was increased to control central sleep apnea. A full face mask was recommended for the
initiation of adaptive servo-ventilation.
Patients were advised to use the adaptive servo-ventilation device for at least 5 hours per
night, 7 days per week. Adherence to therapy was defined as the use of adaptive servo-
ventilation for an average of at least 3 hours per night. The target was to reduce the AHI to
less than 10 events per hour within 14 days after starting adaptive servo-ventilation.
FOLLOW-UP
Clinic visits took place at study entry, after 2 weeks, at 3 and 12 months, and every 12
months thereafter until the end of the study. Patients were contacted by telephone at 6
months and then at 12-month intervals. Patients in the adaptive servo-ventilation group also

underwent polygraphy or polysomnography at each visit, and data were downloaded from
the adaptive servo-ventilation device. Continual on-site monitoring was performed, with
source-data verification of core data in all the patients. Central monitoring of documents
(patients’ records and case-report forms) regarding serious adverse events was performed
before the assessments by the end-point review committee. After the protocol-specified goal
of 651 identified and adjudicated primary end points was met, the trial was terminated, and
final visits were arranged for all the patients so that end-of-trial assessments could be
performed and data regarding any remaining end points or adverse events could be collected
before the database was locked.
END POINTS
The primary study end point in the time-to-event analysis was the first event of the
composite of death from any cause, a lifesaving cardiovascular intervention, or an
unplanned hospitalization for worsening chronic heart failure, with the latter two end-point
events being assessed by the end-point review committee. Lifesaving cardiovascular
intervention included cardiac transplantation, implantation of a long-term ventricular assist
device, resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, or appropriate shock for ventricular
arrhythmia in patients with an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator.
Subsequent hierarchical end points to be tested if the null hypothesis for the primary end
point was rejected were the first secondary end point (which was the same as the primary
end point but included cardiovascular death instead of death from any cause) and the second
secondary end point (which was the same as the primary end point but included unplanned
hospitalization for any cause instead of unplanned hospitalization related to heart failure)
(see the Supplementary Appendix). Additional secondary end points were the time to death
from any cause, the time to death from cardiovascular causes, and change in NYHA class
and change in the 6-minute walk distance (both as assessed at follow-up visits).
Quality of life was assessed with the use of three instruments. Changes in general quality of
life were measured with the use of the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report
Questionnaire (EQ-5D). Changes in disease-specific quality of life were measured with the
use of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire. The effect of sleep apnea on
daytime sleepiness was measured with the use of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (on which
scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more daytime sleepiness).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The study was designed to show a 20% reduction in the rate of the first primary end-point
event with adaptive servo-ventilation. We calculated that data on 651 events had to be
collected for the study to have a power of 80% to show that reduction, at an overall two-
sided type I error rate of 5%. Because recruitment was slower than scheduled and the pooled
event rate was below the expected rate in two blinded interim analyses, the required sample
size was adapted twice, with a planned total of 1193 patients to be recruited over a period of
60 months, plus an additional 2 years of follow-up. Recruitment continued for longer than
planned owing to a delay with an associated substudy, which resulted in the recruitment of
more than 1193 patients. The target number of 651 observed events was never changed.

The primary analysis was conducted in the intention-to-treat population, which consisted of
all the patients who underwent randomization, with adjudication of all the events that
occurred before the database was locked. The analysis followed a group-sequential design
with two interim analyses with O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries and two-sided log-
rank tests comparing the control group with the adaptive servo-ventilation group. The
significance level of the final analysis step was 0.0430, and the corresponding rejection
boundary of the standardized log-rank statistic was ±2.024, keeping an overall two-sided
significance level of 5%. The excess of events at the termination of the trial was included in
the final analysis with the use of the inverse normal method (a combination rule for interim
tests that does not require equal sample sizes of the interim intervals). Cause-specific hazard
ratios were calculated, and cumulative incidence curves that can take potential competing
risks into account were used to visualize survival data. Further details regarding the
statistical analysis, including analyses of the secondary end points and sensitivity analyses,
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
RESULTS
STUDY PATIENTS
A total of 1325 patients were enrolled from February 2008 through May 2013 at 91 centers
and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis; 659 patients were assigned to the control
group and 666 to the adaptive servo-ventilation group (Fig. 1). Information regarding patient
withdrawals, follow-up, and the handling of missing data is provided in the Supplementary
Appendix. Table 1 provides details regarding the demographic and clinical characteristics of
the patients in the two study groups at baseline; the countries of enrollment are listed in
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. There were no significant differences in baseline
characteristics between the control group and the adaptive servo-ventilation group, except
for the rate of antiarrhythmic drug use, which was higher in the adaptive servo-ventilation
group than in the control group (P = 0.005) (Table 1). The respiratory characteristics at
baseline are shown in Table 2.
STUDY INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP
The median duration of follow-up was 31 months (range, 0 to 80). We assessed the median
positive airway pressure values at each time point and then calculated the mean of the
median values (i.e., mean median values). In the adaptive servo-ventilation group, the
device-measured mean median values of expiratory positive airway pressure were 5.5 cm of
water (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4 to 5.6) at baseline and 5.7 cm of water (95% CI,
5.6 to 5.8) at 12 months; the device-measured mean median values of inspiratory positive
airway pressure were 9.7 cm of water (95% CI, 9.6 to 9.8) at baseline and 9.8 cm of water
(95% CI, 9.6 to 9.9) at 12 months. Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix lists additional
device-measured data.
A total of 60% of the patients in the adaptive servo-ventilation group used adaptive servo-
ventilation for an average of 3 hours per night or more during the trial period (Table S3 in
the Supplementary Appendix). Sleep-disordered breathing was well controlled during
adaptive servo-ventilation therapy. At 12 months, the mean AHI was 6.6 events per hour,

and the oxygen desaturation index (the number of times per hour of recording that the blood
oxygen level drops by ≥3 percentage points from baseline) was 8.6 events per hour (Table
S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
SURVIVAL AND CARDIOVASCULAR END POINTS
A summary of end-point events according to treatment group is provided in Table 3. The
incidence of the primary end point did not differ significantly between the adaptive servo-
ventilation group and the control group, with event rates of 54.1% and 50.8%, respectively
(hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.31; P = 0.10) (Fig. 2A). Because the first and second
secondary end points were prespecified to be analyzed hierarchically only if the null
hypothesis for the primary end point was rejected, the results of those analyses are
considered to be exploratory. However, there was no significant difference between the two
groups with respect to either of these end points.
All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher in the adaptive servo-
ventilation group than in the control group. All-cause mortality was 34.8% and 29.3%,
respectively (hazard ratio for death from any cause, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.55; P = 0.01),
and cardiovascular mortality was 29.9% and 24.0%, respectively (hazard ratio for death
from cardiovascular causes, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.65; P = 0.006) (Fig. 2B and 2C).
Similar findings were noted in the sensitivity analyses of all-cause mortality and
cardiovascular mortality (Tables S5 and S6 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
SUBGROUP ANALYSES
Subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary end point and for cardiovascular
mortality. In the analysis of the primary end point, there was a significant modification of
effect by the degree of Cheyne–Stokes respiration, and in the analysis of cardiovascular
mortality, there was a significant modification of effect by the left ventricular ejection
fraction (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE
Assessments performed with the use of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
questionnaire, the EQ-5D, and the NYHA classification showed no significant differences
between the adaptive servo-ventilation group and the control group during the study (Figs.
S3, S4, and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Although the Epworth Sleepiness Scale
score decreased in the two study groups, the change was significantly greater in the adaptive
servo-ventilation group (P<0.001) (Fig. S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was a
gradual decline in the 6-minute walk distance in both the control group and the adaptive
servo-ventilation group, but the decline was significantly more pronounced in the adaptive
servo-ventilation group (P = 0.02) (Fig. S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
DISCUSSION
The SERVE-HF study showed that although adaptive servo-ventilation therapy effectively
treated central sleep apnea, it did not have a significant effect on the composite end point of
death from any cause, lifesaving cardiovascular intervention, or unplanned hospitalization

for worsening heart failure. There was no beneficial effect of adaptive servo-ventilation on a
broad spectrum of functional measures, including quality-of-life measures, 6-minute walk
distance, or symptoms. In fact, there was a significant increase in both cardiovascular
mortality and all-cause mortality in the adaptive servo-ventilation group. The signal for the
primary end point was stronger in patients with a higher proportion of Cheyne–Stokes
respiration than in those who had a lower proportion, and the signal for cardiovascular death
was stronger in patients with very low left ventricular ejection fraction than in those with a
higher left ventricular ejection fraction.
The findings of this study contrast with evidence from smaller studies and meta-analyses
that have shown improvements in surrogate markers, including the plasma concentration of
brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), left ventricular ejection fraction, quality-of-life scores,
functional outcomes, and mortality among patients who have heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction and have central sleep apnea that is treated with adaptive servo-
ventilation.11,14–17 The recently published results of the Study of the Effects of Adaptive
Servo-ventilation Therapy on Cardiac Function and Remodeling in Patients with Chronic
Heart Failure (SAVIOR-C) showed a lack of effect of adaptive servo-ventilation therapy on
left ventricular ejection fraction and plasma BNP concentrations up to a maximum of 24
weeks.18 However, improvements in quality of life and clinical status were associated with
adaptive servo-ventilation therapy in that trial — findings that were not confirmed by our
study.
The CANPAP trial was a large, randomized, outcome study that investigated CPAP
treatment for central sleep apnea in patients with heart failure.9 That trial showed no benefit
of CPAP. A post hoc analysis of data from that trial indicated that mortality might be lower
when CPAP therapy is associated with an early and significant reduction in AHI (to <15
events per hour at 3 months).10 However, in our trial, adaptive servo-ventilation showed no
benefit with respect to cardiovascular end points, despite effective control of sleep-
disordered breathing.
The early and sustained increase in cardiovascular mortality seen in the adaptive servo-
ventilation group in this trial was unexpected, and the pathophysiological features of this
effect remain to be elucidated. One possible explanation is that central sleep apnea may be a
compensatory mechanism in patients with heart failure, as has been suggested previously.19
Potentially beneficial consequences of central sleep apnea, particularly Cheyne–Stokes
respiration, in patients with heart failure that could have been attenuated by adaptive servo-
ventilation include the resting of respiratory muscles, attenuation of excessive sympathetic
nervous system activity, avoidance of hypercapnic acidosis, hyperventilation-related
increases in end-expiratory lung volume, and intrinsic positive airway pressure.19
Diminishing this compensatory adaptive respiratory pattern with adaptive servo-ventilation
may be detrimental in patients with heart failure, as suggested by the subgroup analysis that
showed a positive association between the proportion of Cheyne–Stokes respiration and the
adverse effect of adaptive servo-ventilation on cardiovascular mortality.
Another possible explanation is that the application of positive airway pressure may impair
cardiac function in at least some patients with heart failure. A number of studies have

documented decreased cardiac output and stroke volume during positive airway pressure
therapy, particularly when the pulmonary-capillary wedge pressure is low.20–23 However,
the hemodynamic effects of positive airway pressure appear to be neutral or beneficial in
patients with heart failure and high wedge pressures.20–22,24 Even in patients with severe
systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction, ≤35%), short-term treatment with
bilevel positive airway pressure therapy has been shown to significantly improve left
ventricular performance.25 Furthermore, no safety concerns have been identified during the
short-term application of positive airway pressure in patients with decompensated heart
failure.26
Our study has a few limitations. The main limitation of the study was its unblinded design,
which has the potential to introduce bias. However, this bias would be more likely to favor
the active treatment group, particularly with regard to quality of life, and improvement in
this outcome was not seen in the study results. In addition, owing to the epidemiologic
factors associated with central sleep apnea and with heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction, relatively few women were recruited to the study. Finally, the study was conducted
in patients who had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and therefore the results
cannot be generalized to patients who have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
The study results also cannot be extrapolated to patients with predominantly obstructive
sleep apnea. As compared with central apnea events, obstructive apnea events may lead to
more adverse loading of the heart by increasing the left ventricular afterload by means of the
combined effects of elevations in systemic blood pressure and the generation of increased
negative intrathoracic pressure, which can be reversed by means of positive airway pressure
therapies.
It should be noted that the algorithms used by different adaptive servo-ventilation devices
vary, but the principle of treatment is the same (i.e., back-up rate ventilation with adaptive
pressure support). Although previous studies have not differentiated between devices in
terms of the effects of adaptive servo-ventilation therapy, there is an ongoing study of this
question (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01128816) that may help determine whether the
safety signal identified in SERVE-HF is limited to a particular device or algorithm.
In conclusion, we found that in patients who had heart failure with a reduced ejection
fraction and predominantly central sleep apnea, the addition of adaptive servo-ventilation to
guideline-based medical treatment did not improve the outcome. The risk of cardiovascular
death was increased by 34%, which was sustained throughout the trial, and there was no
beneficial effect on quality of life or symptoms of heart failure. These results were seen
despite effective control of central sleep apnea during adaptive servo-ventilation therapy.

Figure 1. Randomization, Treatment, and Follow-up of the Patients
Patients who withdrew consent did so for both study participation and follow-up (see the
Supplementary Appendix). Of the 73 patients who withdrew consent in the control group, 3
had started adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV), and of the 82 who withdrew consent in the
ASV group, 2 had discontinued ASV. CPAP denotes continuous positive airway pressure,
and PAP positive airway pressure.

Figure 2. Cumulative Incidence Curves for the Primary End Point, Death from Any Cause, and
Cardiovascular Death
The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, lifesaving cardiovascular
intervention (cardiac transplantation, implantation of a long-term ventricular assist device,
resuscitation after sudden cardiac arrest, or appropriate shock for ventricular arrhythmia in
patients with an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator), and unplanned hospitalization for
worsening chronic heart failure.

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. There were no significant differences between the control group and the adaptive servo-ventilation group,
except for the rate of antiarrhythmic drug use, which was higher in the adaptive servo-ventilation group than in the control group (P = 0.005). Data
were missing for the following characteristics: body weight, for 8 patients in the control group and 9 in the adaptive servo-ventilation group; body-
mass index, for 8 and 9, respectively; left ventricular ejection fraction, for 126 and 130, respectively; systolic blood pressure, for 15 and 11,
respectively; diastolic blood pressure, for 15 and 12, respectively; hemoglobin, for 27 and 25, respectively; creatinine level, for 30 and 29,
respectively; and 6-minute walk distance, for 41 and 34, respectively.
ACE denotes angiotensin-converting–enzyme, ARB angiotensin-receptor blocker, CRT cardiac-resynchronization therapy, CRT-D CRT with
defibrillator function, CRT-P CRT with pacemaker function, GFR glomerular filtration rate, ICD implantable cardioverter–defibrillator, and
NYHA New York Heart Association.
†
The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
‡
The measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction was added to the study protocol 32 months after the first patient underwent randomization.
§
Left bundle-branch block was assessed in patients who did not have an implanted device.
¶
To convert the values for creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4.

*
Plus–minus values are means ±SD. There were no significant differences between the control group and the adaptive servo-ventilation group.
Data were missing for the following characteristics: Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, for 8 patients in the control group and 13 in the adaptive
servo-ventilation group; the apnea–hypopnea index (AHI; the number of occurrences of apnea or hypopnea per hour), for 1 in the adaptive servo-
ventilation group; central apnea index divided by the total AHI, for 2 in the adaptive servo-ventilation group; central AHI divided by the total AHI,
for 1 in the adaptive servo-ventilation group; mean oxygen desaturation index, for 4 in the control group and 7 in the adaptive servo-ventilation
group; average oxygen saturation, for 3 in the adaptive servo-ventilation group; minimum oxygen saturation, for 5 in the adaptive servo-ventilation
group; and time with an oxygen saturation of less than 90%, for 3 in the control group and 10 in the adaptive servo-ventilation group.
†
Scores on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more daytime sleepiness.
‡
The oxygen desaturation index is the number of times per hour of recording that the blood oxygen level drops by ≥3 percentage points from
baseline.
