a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%)
and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10;
95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34). No significant effect on any individual
or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced
snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.
CONCLUSIONS
Therapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent
cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and
established cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Re-

Testing for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involved the use a home sleep­study screening device (ApneaLink
[ResMed]). During the 1­week run­in period, the participants received sham continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) and were educated on the use of the equipment. In the case of participants who discontinued the study,
only data that were acquired before discontinuation were included in the analysis.

Discussion
This secondary prevention trial in adults with
cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea
showed that the risk of serious cardiovascular
events was not lower among patients who re-
ceived treatment with CPAP in addition to usual
care than among those who received usual care
alone. Treatment with CPAP was associated with
a greater reduction in symptoms of daytime
sleepiness and with improved health-related qual-
ity of life, mood, and attendance at work. This
study was not powered to provide definitive an-
swers regarding the effects of CPAP on second- Figure 2. Cumulative Event Curve of the Primary End Point.
