tation favored the control group, but after 18 months the divergence favored the CPAP
group, yet the overall event rates (death and heart transplantation) did not differ (32 vs.
32 events, respectively; P=0.54).
conclusions
Although CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea, improved nocturnal oxygenation, in-
creased the ejection fraction, lowered norepinephrine levels, and increased the distance
walked in six minutes, it did not affect survival. Our data do not support the use of
CPAP to extend life in patients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.

clinical trial registration
The Journal encourages investigators to register their clinical trials in a public trials
registry. The members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors
plan to consider clinical trials for publication only if they have been registered
(see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1). The National Library of Medicine’s
www.clinicaltrials.gov is a free registry, open to all investigators, that meets
the committee’s requirements.
