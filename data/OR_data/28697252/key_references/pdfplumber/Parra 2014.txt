during the acute stroke phase with maintenance of the

The presence of obstructive events has been suggested
previously as a risk factor with harmful consequences in
stroke patients (Shahar et al., 2001; Yaggi et al., 2005), but
also as a possible prognostic factor based on its known
physiopathological mechanisms, although this relation has
not been demonstrated fully (Balfors and Franklin, 1994;
