Secondary outcomes related to cognitive function did
not show any diff erence between the two groups, despite
improvements in sleepiness in the CPAP group.
Additionally, mood, which might also aff ect cognitive
function, was not signifi cantly diff erent between the −5
two groups. Although, patients in this trial had a low
prevalence of depression compared with those in a recent
study,24 and the baseline cognitive scores were often
within the age-adjusted normative range, which could
have resulted in a ceiling eff ect. The low overall use of
