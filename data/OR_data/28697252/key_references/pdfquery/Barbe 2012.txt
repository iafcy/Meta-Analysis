Context Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for pa- 
tients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, its indication for all 
patients with sleep-disordered breathing, regardless of daytime symptoms, is unclear. 
Objective To evaluate the effect of CPAP treatment on the incidence of hyperten- 
sion or cardiovascular events in a cohort of nonsleepy patients with OSA. 
Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, parallel-group, randomized con- 
trolled trial in 14 teaching hospitals in Spain. Between May 2004 and May 2006, 725 
consecutive patients were enrolled who had an apnea-hypopnea index of 20 h−1 or 
greater and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 10 or less (scores range from 0-24, 
with values (cid:2)10 suggesting no daytime sleepiness). Exclusion criteria were previous 
cardiovascular event, physical or psychological incapacity, chronic disease, or drug or 
alcohol addiction. Follow-up ended in May 2009. 
Intervention Patients were allocated to receive CPAP treatment or no active inter- 
vention. All participants received dietary counseling and sleep hygiene advice. 
Main Outcome Measures Incidence of either systemic hypertension (taking an- 
tihypertensive medication or blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) or cardio- 
vascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack, 
hospitalization for unstable angina or arrhythmia, heart failure, or cardiovascular death). 
Results Seven hundred twenty-three patients underwent follow-up for a median of 4 
(interquartile range, 2.7-4.4) years (1 patient from each group did not receive allocated 
treatment); 357 in the CPAP group and 366 in the control group were included in the 
analysis. In the CPAP group there were 68 patients with new hypertension and 28 car- 
diovascular events (17 unstable angina or arrhythmia, 3 nonfatal stroke, 3 heart failure, 
2 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 transient ischemic attack, 1 cardiovascular death). In 
the control group there were 79 patients with new hypertension and 31 cardiovascular 
events (11 unstable angina or arrhythmia, 8 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 5 transient 
ischemic attack, 5 heart failure, 2 nonfatal stroke). The hypertension or cardiovascular 
event incidence density rate was 9.20 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 7.36-11.04) in 
the CPAP group and 11.02 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 8.96-13.08) in the control 
group. The incidence density ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.63-1.1; P=.20). 
Conclusions In patients with OSA without daytime sleepiness, the prescription of 
CPAP compared with usual care did not result in a statistically significant reduction in 
the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events. However, the study may have 
had limited power to detect a significant difference.

sion,3,4 and OSA has been associated with 
cardiovascular diseases,5-7 although this 
association is attenuated in some stud- 
ies when adjusted for age and obesity.8 
Continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) acts as a pneumatic splint to the 
upper airway during sleep and corrects 
the obstruction, improving daytime 
sleepiness and quality of life in patients 
with OSA.9 Also, CPAP treatment can re- 
duce blood pressure in these patients.10 
Observational studies suggest that CPAP 
treatment reduces the incidence of fatal 
and nonfatal cardiovascular events in pa- 
tients with severe11 and moderate12 OSA. 
However, none of these studies were ran- 
domized. To perform such studies in 
symptomatic patients would be unethi- 
cal because available evidence of the ef- 
fectiveness of CPAP on symptom con- 
trol and accident risk precludes the 
possibility of withholding treatment in 
a long-term study. The indication for 
CPAP treatment in nonsleepy patients is 
under debate. Two short-term random- 
ized controlled trials have shown no ef- 
fect of CPAP on blood pressure and clini- 
cal variables in nonsleepy patients with 
OSA.13,14 Nonetheless, because of the 
high incidence of cardiovascular com- 
plications in patients with OSA, some au- 
thors advocate the long-term use of 
CPAP treatment for all patients with 
sleep-disordered breathing, regardless of 
daytime symptoms.15 
The primary objective of this study 
was to evaluate the effect of CPAP treat- 
ment on the incidence of hypertension 
or cardiovascular events in a cohort of 
nonsleepy patients with OSA. We stud- 
ied this composite outcome because hy- 
pertension and cardiovascular events 
have been associated with OSA, they 
share related pathological pathways, and 
their clinical relevance has been estab- 
lished.16 The secondary objective was to 
evaluate the relationship between OSA 
severity and the incidence of hyperten- 
sion or cardiovascular events. 
METHODS 
Setting and Participants 
Recruitment took place in 14 Spanish 
teaching hospitals between May 2004 
and May 2006. Follow-up ended in May 
2009. Patients were referred to sleep 
units for evaluation of observed ap- 
neas or snoring. The study was ap- 
proved by the ethics committee of each 
participating center, and patients pro- 
vided written informed consent. 
Patients were eligible if they were be- 
tween 18 and 70 years old, showed 20 
or more apneas plus hypopneas per 
hour (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) in 
an overnight sleep study, and had no 
daytime hypersomnolence, defined as 
an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score 
of 10 or lower (ESS scores have a range 
of 0-24). The exclusion criteria were 
physical or psychological incapacity, 
any previous cardiovascular event, 
chronic disease, drug or alcohol addic- 
tion, chronic intake of hypnotics, or re- 
fusal to participate in the study. Pa- 
tients with a history of hypertension 
were not excluded. 
The OSA diagnosis was made using 
a conventional polysomnographic or 
cardiorespiratory sleep study. The car- 
diorespiratory study included, at mini- 
mum, continuous recording from na- 
sal cannulae, thoracic-abdominal 
motion, oxygen saturation, and body 
position. Results from all sleep studies 
were analyzed by trained personnel at 
each participating center, using stan- 
dard criteria. An apnea was defined as 
an absence of airflow of 10 seconds or 
longer and a hypopnea as an airflow re- 
duction ((cid:3)50%) lasting 10 seconds or 
longer with a greater than 4% de- 
crease in oxygen saturation. Obstruc- 
tive apneas were defined as the ab- 
sence of airflow in the presence of chest 
or abdominal wall motion. The AHI was 
calculated based on the average num- 
ber of apnea plus hypopnea episodes 
per hour of sleep or recording time. 
Randomization, Blinding, 
and Intervention 
Eligible patients were randomly as- 
signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive CPAP 
treatment or no active intervention. 
Randomization was performed using a 
computer-generated list of random 
numbers in the coordinating center and 
was stratified by center. The results 
were mailed in numbered opaque en- 
velopes. The coordinating center saved 
a sealed copy of the randomization list 
sent to each center. Blood pressures and 
all cardiovascular events were as- 
sessed objectively by personnel not in- 
volved in the study and blinded to pa- 
tient allocation. Patients, researchers, 
and the statistician were not blinded to 
patient allocation. 
CPAP titration was performed using 
conventional polysomnography or an 
autoCPAP device following a vali- 
dated protocol.17 CPAP adherence was 
measured using the machines’ inter- 
nal clocks. All participants received 
sleep hygiene advice and dietary coun- 
seling for weight loss from the staff of 
the sleep units. There was no specific 
weight loss program, and patients were 
referred to their general practitioner to 
monitor weight loss. 
Outcomes and Follow-up 
The primary outcome was the inci- 
dence of either systemic hypertension 
(among participants who were normo- 
tensive at baseline) or cardiovascular 
events (among all participants). The 
secondary outcome was the associa- 
tion between the incidence of hyper- 
tension or cardiovascular events and the 
severity of OSA assessed by the AHI and 
oxygen saturation. 
Information regarding medication use, 
OSA severity, sleepiness (ESS score), 
blood pressure, a basic biochemical as- 
sessment, and results of electrocardiog- 
raphy were recorded for each patient at 
inclusion. Cardiovascular events in- 
cluded nonfatal myocardial infarction, 
nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack, 
hospitalization for unstable angina or ar- 
rhythmia, heart failure, and cardiovas- 
cular death. All cardiovascular events 
were identified by a cardiologist or neu- 
rologist not involved in the study and 
blinded to the patients’ randomization 
status. Hypertension was defined as tak- 
ing antihypertensive medication or blood 
pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg. 
Blood pressure measurements were taken 
by experienced nurses, following inter- 
national guidelines.18 
Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, and 
12 months and annually thereafter. The 




study was designed to follow up pa- 
tients for at least 3 years. However, fol- 
low-up for the main outcome was 
stopped when the patients developed 
new-onset hypertension or experi- 
enced a cardiovascular event, with- 
drew informed consent, were unable to 
complete follow-up, or when there was 
a change from control group to CPAP 
treatment. Exposure time was defined 
as the time between randomization and 
first cardiovascular event or new- 
onset hypertension, date of death, date 
of the last study visit, date of with- 
drawal, or loss to follow-up. 
At each visit a physician recorded car- 
diovascular events, blood pressure, ESS 
score, weight, CPAP adherence, medi- 
cations, alcohol and tobacco consump- 
tion, and other clinically relevant events. 
Sample Size 
The sample size was calculated assum- 
ing that the incidence of hypertension or 
new cardiovascular event in this popu- 
lation over a period of 3 years would be 
10% annually. This estimation was based 
on published studies19 and data pro- 
vided by the Spanish National Epidemi- 
ology Center. We estimated that CPAP 
would reduce the incidence of new hy- 
pertension or cardiovascular events by 
60% based on a cohort study by Marin 
et al11 that showed a cardiovascular event 
rate of 2.13 per 100 person-years in an 
untreated group vs 0.64 per 100 person- 
years in a group of patients treated with 
CPAP, a 70% relative rate reduction. We 
assumed (cid:4)=.05, (cid:5)=.10, 2-sided signifi- 
cance testing, and 10% study dropout. 
Under these assumptions, the study 
would need to enroll a total of 345 pa- 
tients per group. 
Statistical Analysis 
Data were stored in a web-based appli- 
cation. R version 2.10.1 was used for 
all analyses. Estimated means for treat- 
ment adherence, body mass index (BMI, 
calculated as weight in kilograms di- 
vided by height in meters squared), and 
ESS scores during the follow-up pe- 
riod were computed individually for 
each patient as the area under the curve 
obtained from the values reported in fol- 
low-up visits, taking into account the 
time between visits and the last avail- 
able information. 
Mann-Whitney tests (or t tests if data 
were normally distributed) and Pear- 
son (cid:6)2 tests with a Yates continuity cor- 
rection (or Fisher exact tests if ex- 
pected frequencies were less than 5) 
were used for continuous and categori- 
cal variables, respectively, when com- 
paring the CPAP and control groups. 
The effect of the CPAP intervention was 
assessed as an incidence density ratio 
(IDR) of hypertension or cardiovascu- 
lar events, and significance was as- 
sessed using the Wald test. A modi- 
fied intention-to-treat approach was 
used, in which all patients receiving the 
allocated intervention were included in 
the analysis of the primary outcome. 
For modeling incidence, a Poisson re- 
gression model was used and adjusted 
for intervention group. An additional 
analysis including random hospital (site) 
effect was performed because of the hos- 
pital imbalances in baseline variables. A 
goodness-of-fit test for the assumption 
of a Poisson distribution was per- 
formed in every adjusted model to de- 
termine if a negative binomial model 
should be used instead. The use of a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model 
was not possible because the data did not 
satisfy the proportional hazards assump- 
tion.20 Available information was used 
with no need for imputation. 
The cumulative incidence, CI(t), of 
events at time t was estimated using the 
incidence density at that time, ID(t), in 
the equation CI(t)= 1−exp{−ID(t)*t}. 
Therefore, each point of the graph 
shows the cumulative incidence after 
t years of follow-up in the study, ex- 
pressed as a percentage. A post hoc 
analysis was performed to assess a pos- 
sible dose-response relationship. For 
this analysis, the CPAP group was par- 
titioned based on whether the mean 
CPAP adherence during follow-up was 
less than 4 hours.11 The outcomes in 
each of these CPAP subgroups were 
compared with those in the control 
group. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum 
test was used to analyze the dose- 
response relationship as well as differ- 
ences between hospitals in quantita- 
tive baseline variables. 
The secondary outcome of the study 
was to assess the association between 
the incidence of cardiovascular events 
or hypertension and disease severity. To 
assess this association, we tested the in- 
teraction of severity variables (AHI and 
time with arterial oxygen saturation 
[SaO2] (cid:2)90%, dichotomized into 2 
groups based on their median values) 
with the intervention in a Poisson re- 
gression model, with the outcome vari- 
able being the incidence of hyperten- 
sion or cardiovascular events. 
Differences between baseline val- 
ues and the mean area under the curve 
for BMI and ESS score in follow-up vis- 
its were calculated for each patient. 
These differences were compared be- 
tween intervention groups using the 
Mann-Whitney nonparametric test. 
RESULTS 
A total of 725 patients were random- 
ized, with 357 in the CPAP group and 
366 in the control group analyzed 
(FIGURE 1). Baseline variables were 
comparable between the CPAP and con- 
trol groups, with the exception of AHI 
and time with SaO2 less than 90%. Fifty 
percent of the sample was hyperten- 
sive at inclusion (TABLE 1). Many of the 
baseline variables had site-specific dif- 
ferences (eTable 1, available at http: 
//www.jama.com). 
Follow-up time until a cardiovascu- 
lar event, loss to follow-up, or the end 
of the study ranged from 0 to 5.38 years, 
with a median of 4.0 years (interquar- 
tile range [IQR], 2.7-4.4 years). There 
were no significant differences in me- 
dian follow-up between groups using 
the Mann-Whitney test (4.01 years 
[IQR, 3.01-4.37] for the CPAP group 
vs 3.96 years [IQR, 2.19-4.38] for the 
control group; P=.13). 
Primary Outcome: Effects of CPAP 
on the Incidence of Hypertension 
or Cardiovascular Events 
A total of 147 patients with new hyper- 
tension and 59 cardiovascular events 
were identified. In the CPAP group, there 
were 68 patients with new hyperten- 





Only those patients excluded in the allocation process were excluded from the analysis. Discontinuation of 
intervention was more frequent in the control group, in which patients were excluded because of somnolence

pregnancy (n=1), or other cause (n=1). 
sion and 28 cardiovascular events (17 
hospitalizations for unstable angina or ar- 
rhythmia, 3 nonfatal stroke, 3 heart fail- 
ure, 2 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 
transient ischemic attack, 1 cardiovas- 
cular death). In the control group, there 
were 79 patients with new hyperten- 
sion and 31 cardiovascular events (11 
hospitalizations for unstable angina or ar- 
rhythmia, 8 nonfatal myocardial infarc- 
tion, 5 transient ischemic attack, 5 heart 
failure, 2 nonfatal stroke). The inci- 
dence density rate for hypertension or 
cardiovascular events in the CPAP group 
was 11.02 per 100 person-years and in 
the control group was 9.20 per 100 per- 
son-years. The IDR was 0.83 (95% CI, 
0.63-1.1; P = .20) (T A B L E 2 and 
FIGURE 2A). Adjustment for random 
hospital (site) effect did not substan- 
tially modify these results (TABLE 3) 
Secondary Outcomes: Relationship 
Between Incidence of Events 
and OSA Severity 
Disease severity was assessed using AHI 
and time with SaO2 less than 90%. The 
effect of CPAP on the incidence of hy- 
pertension or cardiovascular events 
with reference to the control group 
showed no significant differences across 
subgroups of AHI (P=.48) or the per- 
centage of time with SaO2 less than 90% 
(P=.23). No significant interaction was 
found between treatment group and 
each of the disease severity variables. 
Subgroup Analyses 
The mean CPAP adherence ranged from 
0 to 8.76 h/night, with a median of 5.00 
h/night (IQR, 2.18-6.25). In a post hoc 
analysis, we partitioned the patients in 
the CPAP group based on a mean ad- 
herence of 4 h/night.11 There were 127 
patients (36%) with a mean adher- 
ence less than 4 h/night (median, 1.00 
[IQR, 0.00-2.75]) and 230 with adher- 
ence of 4h/night or longer (median, 5.96 
[IQR, 5.05-6.70]). There were signifi- 
cant differences between these sub- 
groups in AHI, time with SaO2 less than 
90%, neck circumference, BMI, and hy- 
pertension when compared at base- 
line (TABLE 4). 
Primary Outcome 
by Adherence Subgroups 
Patients who used CPAP for less than 4 
h/night had an IDR of 1.13 (95% CI, 0.78- 
1.64; P=.51), compared with the control 
group. In contrast, patients who used 
CPAP for 4 h/night or longer had an IDR 
of 0.72 (95% CI. 0.52-0.98; P=.04) 
(Table 2 and Figure 2B). Adjustment for 
random hospital (site) effect did not sub- 
stantially modify these results (Table 3). 
Secondary Outcome 
by Adherence Subgroups 
In post hoc analyses the effect of CPAP 
on the incidence of hypertension or car- 
diovascular events with reference to the 
control group showed a significant inter- 
action with time with SaO2 less than 90% 
when CPAP was partitioned based on a 
thresholdof4hoursofadherence(P=.03), 
whileinteractionwithAHIremainednon- 
significant (P=.57). Thus, the effect of 
CPAPwassignificantlydifferentwhentak- 
ing into account adherence, depending 
on whether the value of the percentage 
oftimewithSaO2lessthan90%wasgreater 
than the overall median of 6.8%. 
Another stratified analysis was con- 
ducted,adjustingforAHI.Thesamplewas 
first divided into subgroups based on the 
percentageoftimewithSaO2lessthan90% 
(with a cutpoint of 6.8% of the time). 
These subgroups were then divided again 
based on CPAP adherence (with a cut- 
point of 4 h/night). For 6.8% of time or 
less with SaO2 less than 90%, the IDR was 
0.71(95%CI,0.40-1.27;P=.25)forCPAP 
adherence less than 4 h/night and 0.72 
(95% CI, 0.45-1.15; P=.17) for CPAP ad- 
herence of4h/night orlonger. Forgreater 
than6.8%oftimewithSaO2lessthan90%, 
the IDR was 1.89 (95% CI, 1.14-3.13; 
P=.01) for CPAP adherence less than 4 
h/night and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.45-1.13; 
P=.15) for CPAP adherence of 4 h/night 
orlonger.Thus,IDRdifferedsignificantly 
from the control group only in the sub- 
group with greater than 6.8% of time with 
SaO2 less than 90% and CPAP adherence 
less than 4 h/night.

is reported in the supplementary on- 
line content. When assessed sepa- 
rately, CPAP did not show any statis- 
tically significant effect on the incidence 
of new cardiovascular events (eTable 2, 
eTable 3, and eFigure 1) or on new- 
onset hypertension (eTable 4, eTable 
5, and eFigure 2). 
There were 8 deaths in the CPAP 
group and 3 in the control group. The 
IDR for death was 2.6 (95% CI, 0.70- 
11.8; P=.16). Of the patients assigned 
to CPAP, 5 died of cancer, 1 of cardio- 
vascular causes, 1 of trauma, and an- 
other of unknown causes. Among con- 
trols, the causes of death were cancer 
for 2 and unknown for 1. 
Decreases in BMI were significantly 
greater in the control group than in the 
CPAP group, with a significant differ- 
ence of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.04-0.46; P=.02) 
(eTable 6). Both groups had changes in 
ESS scores, but these changes were sig- 
nificantly less in the control group than 
in the CPAP group (0.2 vs 1.3; 
P(cid:2).001), with a significant difference 
of −1.1 (95% CI, −1.4 to −0.7; P(cid:2).001) 
(eTable 7). 
COMMENT 
This study suggests that in patients with 
OSA and without daytime sleepiness, the 
prescription of CPAP compared with 
usual care did not result in a statisti- 
cally significant reduction in the inci- 
dence of hypertension or cardiovascu- 
lar events. However, a larger study or 
longer follow-up might have been able 
to identify a significant association be- 
tween treatment and outcome. A post 
hoc analysis suggested that CPAP treat- 
ment may reduce the incidence of hy- 
pertension or cardiovascular events in pa- 
tients with CPAP adherence of 4 h/night 
or longer. The disease severity assessed 
by the AHI and time with SaO2 less than 
90% was not related to the incidence of 
hypertension or cardiovascular events. 
However, patients with worse oxygen 
saturation at night and with CPAP ad- 
herence of less than 4 h/night showed a 
higher rate of hypertension or cardio- 
vascular events than the control group. 
Compelling evidence indicates that 
severe OSA is associated with an in- 

creased incidence of hypertension, car- 
diovascular events, or sudden death 
during sleep.4,6,7,21 Three systematic re- 
views,22-24 4 meta-analyses including 21 
randomized controlled trials,10,25-27 and 
3 recent studies28-30 have evaluated the 
effect of CPAP therapy on blood pres- 
sure in patients with OSA. Results 
showed significant blood pressure re- 
ductions, especially in patients with 
more severe OSA.25,26 However, evi-

on cardiovascular events is less defini- 
tive. Peker et al31 reported a signifi- 
cant increase in the incidence of car- 
diovascular disease among incompletely 
treated patients with OSA compared to 
those who were efficiently treated. Sev- 
eral authors11,12,32,33 have reported an im- 
provement in long-term survival asso- 
ciated with treatment in different 
cohorts of patients with OSA. Marin et 
al11 followed up a male cohort of treated 
and untreated patients with OSA, snor- 
ers, and the general population for 10 
years in an observational study. They 
showed that CPAP treatment was as- 
sociated with a lower risk of fatal and 
nonfatal cardiovascular events in pa- 
tients with severe OSA when com- 
pared with patients who refused CPAP 
treatment. The incidence of cardiovas- 
cular events in patients receiving CPAP 
treatment was not different from that 
in the general population or in nonap- 
neic snorers. Overall, observational 
studies suggest a protective effect of 
CPAP treatment on cardiovascular 
events in patients with OSA. 
In a post hoc analysis in our study, 
CPAP was effective in patients who used 
the treatment for more than 4 h/night. 
Even in these patients, the magnitude 
of the effect was less than in previous 
observational studies.11 In the study by 
Marin et al,11 the group treated with 
CPAP had an event rate of 0.64 per 100 
person-years, whereas the event rate in 
our treatment group was 2.08 per 100 
person-years (eTable 2). These results 
are not unexpected, because random- 
ized trials often show smaller positive 
effects than observational studies. 
Another possible explanation is that 
CPAP is less effective in nonsleepy pa- 
tients. Short-term studies focusing on 
nonsleepy patients have shown no ef- 
fect of CPAP on clinical symptoms or 
blood pressure,13,14 and a long-term 
study showed a mild beneficial effect 
of CPAP on blood pressure only in pa- 
tients who used CPAP for 5.6 h/night 
or longer.28 In our study, the protec- 
tive association of CPAP use with the 
incidence of hypertension or cardio- 
vascular events in the subgroup of pa- 
tients with adherence of 4 h/night or 
longer was seen despite that subgroup 
being more obese and having a higher 
prevalence of hypertension. However, 
the results of post hoc analyses should 
be interpreted with caution and con- 
sidered hypothesis generating. In these 
analyses, patients were not random- 
ized to the subgroups, and findings may 
have resulted from a confounding bias, 
such as the healthy-user effect (eg, ad- 
herent CPAP users may be more likely 
to be adherent with other medica- 
tions, treatments, exercise, nutrition, or 
other health maintenance). 
It has been postulated that non- 
sleepy patients treated with CPAP will 
probably have poor adherence. Our re- 
sults do not support this statement and 
show that CPAP treatment is feasible 
in this population, even in the ab- 
sence of any specific reinforcement. An 
unexpected finding was the relatively 
high number of deaths during follow- 











up. The study sample size was not large 
enough to reach a conclusion about any 
relationship to treatment, but this is- 
sue deserves further research. 
The strengths of our study include 
its multicentric design and the gener- 
alizability of the trial findings. Base- 
line cardiovascular risk factors were not 
different between groups, and median 
follow-up time was similar. Neverthe- 
less, this study has several potential 
limitations. 
First, the lack of effect of CPAP 
on hypertension or cardiovascular 
events could be related to an inad- 
equately powered estimation of the 
sample size. The lack of previous 
studies suitable for sample size calcu- 
lation contributed to the difficulty of 
sample size estimation. The potential 
protective effect of CPAP was prob- 
ably overestimated, and a larger 
study or longer follow-up might have 
been able to identify a significant 
association between treatment and 
outcome. Including patients with 
hypertension also might have con- 
tributed to a lack of study power, 
because these patients could not 
develop 1 component of the com- 
bined primary end point, incident 
hypertension. Incident hypertension 
accounted for more than two-thirds 
of the primary end point events. 
Second, medical research personnel 
were not blinded to patient alloca- 
tion. However, cardiovascular events 
and blood pressure were assessed 
objectively, by personnel not in- 
volved in the study and blinded to 
patient allocation. 
Third, at baseline the CPAP group 
had higher AHI scores and slightly 
greater time with SaO2 less than 90%. 
These differences, although statisti- 
cally significant, were likely to be of 
little clinical relevance, because both 
groups had severe OSA, and all other 
characteristics and cardiovascular risk 
factors were similar between the groups 
at baseline. Fourth, blood pressure val- 
ues were measured at clinic visits, an 
approach that can be affected by the 
white coat effect, observer bias, lim- 
ited reproducibility, and the intrinsic

inaccuracy of the examiner’s ausculta- 
tion technique. However, measure- 
ments were taken by experienced 
nurses following international guide- 
lines. Fifth, one possible explanation for 
the smaller effect size of CPAP in this 
trial compared with prior studies is that 
the titration protocols may have been 
less effective, resulting in an elevated 
residual AHI on CPAP treatment. Al- 
though we do not know if this oc- 
curred, our CPAP titration protocol has 
been validated in previous studies per- 
formed by our research group.17 
In conclusion, in this study of pa- 
tients with OSA without daytime sleepi- 
ness, the prescription of CPAP com- 
pared with usual care did not result in 
a statistically significant reduction in the 
incidence of hypertension or cardio- 
vascular events. However, the study 
may have had limited power to detect 
a significant difference. A post hoc 
analysis suggested that CPAP treat- 
ment may reduce the incidence of hy- 
pertension or cardiovascular events in 
patients with CPAP adherence of 4 
h/night or longer.
