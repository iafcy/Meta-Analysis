BACKGROUND 
Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events; 
whether treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents major 
cardiovascular events is uncertain. 
METHODS 
After a 1-week run-in period during which the participants used sham CPAP, we ran- 
domly assigned 2717 eligible adults between 45 and 75 years of age who had moderate- 
to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and coronary or cerebrovascular disease to receive 
CPAP treatment plus usual care (CPAP group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). 
The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient 
ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health- 
related quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood. 
RESULTS 
Most of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea 
and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP 
therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea–hypopnea index (the number of 
apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour 
at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, 
a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%) 
and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 
95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34). No significant effect on any individual 
or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced 
snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Therapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent 
cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and 
established cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the National Health and Medical Re-

Large negative intrathoracic pressure swings also 
impose mechanical stress on the heart and great 
vessels.5-7 Population-based and sleep-clinic–based 
cohort studies have shown an association be- 
tween obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascu- 
lar events,8-16 particularly stroke.17 Randomized, 
controlled trials have shown that treatment with 
continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) low- 
ers systolic blood pressure by 2 to 3 mm Hg in 
patients with normotensive obstructive sleep 
apnea18 and by 6 to 7 mm Hg in patients with 
resistant hypertension,19 improves endothelial 
function,20 and increases insulin sensitivity.21 
Observational clinical studies have shown that 
the use of CPAP is associated with lower rates of 
cardiovascular complications and of death from 
cardiovascular causes, especially among patients 
who are adherent to treatment.10,13 
Obstructive sleep apnea is a common condi- 
tion among patients with cardiovascular disease, 
affecting 40 to 60% of such patients.12,16,22,23 Be- 
cause the risks of recurrent cardiovascular events 
among these patients remain high despite con- 
temporary therapies, CPAP could be a useful ad- 
ditional treatment for the prevention of these 
events. We describe the main results of the Sleep 
Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints (SAVE) study, a 
secondary prevention trial that was designed to 
evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in reducing 
the rate of cardiovascular events among patients 
with obstructive sleep apnea.24 

Study Design and Oversight 
The SAVE study was an international, multi- 
center, randomized, parallel-group, open-label 
trial, with blinded end-point assessment. Details 
of the design and analysis plan of the trial have 
been published previously.24,25 An executive com- 
mittee (see the Supplementary Appendix, avail- 
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) 
designed the study and supervised the conduct 
of the trial and the collection of the data. The 
Adelaide Institute for Sleep Health of Flinders 
University of South Australia was responsible for 
the overall management of the trial and provided 
the core sleep laboratory analysis and monitor- 
ing of the CPAP data and treatment at the sites. 
Investigators at the George Institute for Global 
Health coordinated the trial, managed the data- 
base, and performed the statistical analyses. All 
the authors vouch for the accuracy and com- 
pleteness of the data and analyses and for the 
fidelity of the trial to the protocol, available at 
NEJM.org. An independent data and safety mon- 
itoring board monitored unblinded trial results 
and safety events. The trial protocol was approved 
by all appropriate regulatory authorities and 
ethics committees at the participating centers. All 
participants provided written informed consent. 
The National Health and Medical Research 
Council of Australia and Philips Respironics 
provided the main funding for the trial. In-kind 
donations were provided by Respironics for the 
CPAP equipment and by ResMed for the sleep 
apnea diagnostic devices. None of the funding 
agencies contributed to the design of the trial, 
the collection or analysis of the data, the writing 
of the manuscript, or the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. 
Patients and Procedures 
Patients were recruited at 89 clinical centers in 
7 countries; eligibility criteria included an age 
between 45 and 75 years, a diagnosis of coro- 
nary artery disease or cerebrovascular disease, 
and a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe obstruc- 
tive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of moderate-to- 
severe obstructive sleep apnea, which was defined 
as an oxygen desaturation index (the number of 
times per hour during the oximetry recording 
that the blood oxygen saturation level drops by 
≥4 percentage points from baseline) of at least 
12, was established with the use of a home sleep- 
study screening device (ApneaLink, ResMed) and 
was confirmed by review of the data at a central 
core sleep laboratory. Patients were excluded from 
the study if they reported severe daytime sleepi- 
ness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale score >15; scores 
range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicat- 
ing greater severity) or were considered to have 
an increased risk of an accident from falling 
asleep, if they had very severe hypoxemia (oxy- 
gen saturation <80% for >10% of recording time), 
or if they had a pattern of Cheyne–Stokes respira- 
tion on the ApneaLink nasal pressure recording. 






Potential participants were required to have a 
minimum level of adherence to CPAP therapy, 
which was defined as an average of 3 hours per 
night, during a 1-week run-in period in which 
sham CPAP was used (i.e., CPAP at subtherapeu- 
tic pressure). Further details of the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and of the procedures per- 
formed at the core sleep laboratory are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix. 
Randomization and Interventions 
After eligibility was confirmed, the patients were 
randomly assigned, at a central location, to re- 
ceive either CPAP therapy plus usual care (CPAP 
group) or usual care alone (usual-care group). 
Randomization was performed with the use of a 
minimization procedure to balance the group 
assignments according to site, type of cardiovas- 
cular disease (cardiac, cerebrovascular, or both), 
and severity of daytime sleepiness (Epworth 
Sleepiness Scale score <11 vs. ≥11). 
The patients who were assigned to receive 
mask-delivered CPAP treatment were provided 
with an automated positive airway pressure ma- 
chine (REMstar Auto, M or PR series, Philips 
Respironics) that was initially set in automatic 
mode for 1 week and thereafter fixed to the 90th 
percentile of pressure that was calculated by the 
automated positive airway pressure device from 
the recorded data. The core sleep laboratory 
monitored trends in adherence to CPAP therapy 
and provided corrective advice to investigators 
(further details are provided in the Supplemen- 
tary Appendix). Concomitant management of 
cardiovascular risk factors was performed in 
accordance with national guidelines. All partici- 
pants were given advice on healthful sleep habits 
and lifestyle changes to minimize obstructive 
sleep apnea. Clinic visits were scheduled for all 
participants at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and annu- 
ally thereafter; the participants were contacted 
by telephone at 6 months between annual clinic 
visits. 
Study Measurements 
At randomization and at each follow-up visit, 
participants had resting blood pressure and heart 
rate measured at the clinic, and details of cur- 
rent medication use and health behaviors were 
documented through a structured interview. 
Among the participants in the CPAP group, data 
on adherence to the use of the CPAP device were 
recorded. At randomization, at 6 months, and at 
2 and 4 years, anthropometric measurements 
were obtained in all participants, and all partici- 
pants completed several questionnaires: ques- 
tionnaires that assessed symptoms of obstruc- 
tive sleep apnea (snoring, witnessed episodes of 
apnea, and degree of sleepiness according to the 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale score), the Medical Out- 
comes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey 
(SF-36; scores range from 0 to 100, with higher 
scores indicating better quality of life) for assess- 
ment of health-related quality of life, and the 
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (on which 
anxiety and depression scores range from 0 to 21, 
with higher scores indicating more symptoms) 
for assessment of mood. Electrocardiography was 
performed in all participants at the time of ran- 
domization and at 2 years. The European Qual- 
ity of Life–5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D; 
scores range from 1 to 3, with higher scores 
indicating more problems across five categories 
of quality of life) was administered only at the 
end-of-study visit. 
The end-of-study visits were conducted from 
September 2015 through January 2016 (except 
in India, where they were conducted from July 
through October 2013). In addition to performing 
a regular central review of data quality, research 
staff visited the participating sites to monitor and 
verify the completeness and authenticity of source 
documents and adverse-event reporting. Addi- 
tional details on study measurements and moni- 
toring procedures are provided in the Supple- 
mentary Appendix. 
Study End Points 
A committee whose members were unaware of 
the study-group assignments adjudicated the 
major cardiovascular outcomes specified in the 
protocol. The primary end point was a composite 
of death from any cardiovascular cause, myocar- 
dial infarction (including silent myocardial in- 
farction), stroke, or hospitalization for heart fail- 
ure, acute coronary syndrome (including unstable 
angina), or transient ischemic attack. Prespeci- 
fied secondary cardiovascular end points included 
the individual components of the primary com- 
posite end point, other composites of cardio- 
vascular events, revascularization procedures, new- 
onset atrial fibrillation, new-onset diabetes 






mellitus, and death from any cause. Other sec- 
ondary end points included symptoms of obstruc- 
tive sleep apnea, health-related quality of life, 
and mood. 
Prespecified safety end points were assessed 
each time the participant was contacted; these 
end points included all serious adverse events, 
self-reported accidents causing personal injury 
that occurred while the participant was driving 
or while at work, and any accidents or near-miss 
accidents that occurred as a result of the partici- 
pant falling asleep. Two safety end points that 
were not prespecified — the number of self- 
reported road-traffic accidents from any cause 
and the number of days off from work because of 
poor health — were also assessed. Descriptions 
of the study end points and of the procedures 
used by the data and safety monitoring board 
and end-point adjudicators are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix. 
Statistical Analysis 
Our original plan was to recruit 5000 patients. 
In 2012, challenges in achieving recruitment tar- 
gets prompted us to review the accumulated 
blinded study data and an updated meta-regres- 
sion of studies of cardiovascular events and sever- 
ity of obstructive sleep apnea. The meta-regres- 
sion showed that cardiovascular risk increased 
by 25 to 32% for every increase of 10 events per 
hour in the apnea–hypopnea index (the number 
of occurrences of apnea or hypopnea per hour of 
sleep), which was a stronger relationship than 
we had originally assumed.24 In consideration of 
this information, together with interim blinded 
trial data showing an annual event rate of 6.86% 
and better-than-expected adherence to CPAP ther- 
apy, we revised our sample size to 2500 patients; 
we estimated that with this sample size, the study 
would have 90% statistical power (at an alpha level 
of 0.05) to detect a 25% lower incidence with 
CPAP plus usual care than with usual care alone 
of the primary composite cardiovascular end point, 
which was anticipated to occur in 533 patients 
overall over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years. 
The primary analysis was an unadjusted sur- 
vival analysis performed according to the inten- 
tion-to-treat principle with the use of Cox pro- 
portional-hazards regression modeling that was 
based on positively adjudicated events. We per- 
formed a series of sensitivity analyses, including 
an analysis with adjustment for stratification 
variables, region, and severity of obstructive sleep 
apnea; an analysis with Poisson regression to 
account for participants with multiple events; 
and an analysis that included all events that were 
reported by the investigators and not just those 
that were positively adjudicated. To estimate the 
effect in patients who were adherent to CPAP 
therapy, which was defined as an average of 
4 hours or more of treatment per night over the 
first 2 years, we used prespecified propensity- 
score matching to match adherent patients one- 
to-one with participants selected from the usual- 
care (control) group who never used CPAP. The 
change in clinical variables from baseline to 48 
months or to the end-of-study visit (whichever 
came first) was assessed with the use of analysis 
of covariance with adjustment for baseline values. 
All P values are two-sided and were not adjusted 
for multiple testing. Statistical analyses were 
performed with the use of SAS software, version 
9.3 (SAS Institute). (Additional details regarding 
the sample-size calculations and other aspects 
of the statistical analysis are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.) 

Study Participants 
A total of 15,325 patients were assessed for eligi- 
bility; 5844 met the initial eligibility criteria and 
underwent ApneaLink testing, and 3246 entered 
the 1-week run-in phase (Fig. 1). The 2717 patients 
who were eligible for participation after the run- 
in phase were enrolled in the study from Decem- 
ber 2008 through November 2013 and were ran- 
domly assigned to receive CPAP plus usual care 
(1359 patients) or usual care alone (1358 patients). 
All 21 participants from one site were ex- 
cluded from the study because it was determined 
during site monitoring that the required stan- 
dard for conducting clinical trials was not met; 
in addition, 9 other participants withdrew con- 
sent at the time of randomization or did not ad- 
here to the trial protocol from the time of ran- 
domization. Thus, 2687 participants were included 
in the primary analysis (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The 
mean age of the participants was 61 years, and 
81% were men. The mean body-mass index (the 
weight in kilograms divided by the square of 
the height in meters) of the participants was 29; 
the mean oxygen desaturation index, 28 events 
per hour; and the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale

Testing for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) involved the use a home sleep­study screening device (ApneaLink 
[ResMed]). During the 1­week run­in period, the participants received sham continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) and were educated on the use of the equipment. In the case of participants who discontinued the study, 
only data that were acquired before discontinuation were included in the analysis.

tween those with coronary artery disease and 
those with cerebrovascular disease. 
Final follow-up visits were completed by Janu- 
ary 2016; a total of 147 patients discontinued 
their participation in the study before the intended 
final visit, but their data up to the time of with- 
drawal were included in the primary analysis 
performed in the intention-to-treat population 
(Fig. 1). The mean duration of follow-up was 
3.7 years. (Further details on the study partici- 
pants are provided in Tables S1, S2, and S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix.) 
Intervention Adherence, Medications, 
and Lifestyle Factors 
The mean duration of use of the sham CPAP 
device during the 1-week run-in phase was 5.2 
hours per night (Table 1). Among the participants 
in the CPAP group, the mean (±SD) duration of 
adherence to CPAP therapy in the first month of 
treatment was 4.4±2.2 hours per night, which de- 
creased to 3.5±2.4 hours per night by 12 months 
and remained relatively stable thereafter (mean 
adherence during follow-up, 3.3±2.3 hours). The 
residual apnea–hypopnea index during CPAP 
use, as measured by the CPAP machine, averaged 
3.7 events per hour, which indicated good con- 
trol of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP. Of the 
1346 patients in the CPAP group, 566 (42%) had 
good adherence to treatment (≥4 hours per night) 
during follow-up. Of the 1341 patients who were 
followed in the usual-care group, 90 (6.7%) tried 
CPAP but only 57 (4.3%) continued the treatment. 
No significant differences were observed be- 
tween the CPAP group and the usual-care group 
in the use of medications for diabetes mellitus 
and cardiovascular conditions, in lifestyle factors 
including diet and smoking, and in body-mass 
index from baseline to the end of the study. 
(Further details are provided in Fig. S1 and Tables 
S4 through S6 in the Supplementary Appendix.) 
Primary End Point 
A primary end-point event was confirmed in 436 
participants — 229 (17.0%) in the CPAP group 
and 207 (15.4%) in the usual-care group (hazard 
ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.91 to 1.32; P = 0.34) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). 
No significant effect of CPAP was found in the 
adjusted analysis or in the analyses that were 
based on total event rates and on primary end- 
point events reported by the investigators. No 
significant heterogeneity was observed for the 
primary end point across subgroups defined ac- 
cording to region (China vs. outside China), age 
group (>60 years vs. ≤60 years), sex, severity of 
obstructive sleep apnea, body-mass index (<30 vs. 
≥30), daytime sleepiness, type of cardiovascular 
disease, and presence or absence of diabetes 
mellitus. 
Anthropometric and disease characteristics 
of patients with good adherence to CPAP therapy 
(≥4 hours per night) differed from those of pa- 
tients with lower adherence and from the patients 
in the usual-care group as a whole. One-to-one 
propensity-score matching was performed to com- 
pare 561 patients who were adherent to CPAP 
therapy with 561 patients in the usual-care group. 
Among these propensity-score–matched patients, 
184 primary end-point events occurred — 86 
(15.3%) in the CPAP group and 98 (17.5%) in the 
usual-care group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 
0.60 to 1.07; P = 0.13). The adjusted Cox regres- 
sion model (adjusted for the baseline factors used 
in the propensity-score–matching comparison) 
that compared patients with good adherence and 
those with poor adherence in the CPAP group 
with the patients in the usual-care group showed 
a similar result. (Further details on the results 
for the primary end point are provided in Tables

Secondary and Other End Points 
No significant between-group differences were 
observed in any of the cause-specific or compos- 
ite secondary cardiovascular end points in the 
primary analysis (Table 2) or in the subsidiary 
analyses, except for a higher rate of total hospital 
admissions for transient ischemic attack among 
the patients in the CPAP group (relative risk, 
2.29; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.99; P = 0.04). The propen- 
sity score–matched analyses showed that the 
patients who were adherent to CPAP therapy had 
a lower risk of stroke than those in the usual- 
care group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32 to 
1.00; P = 0.05), as well as a lower risk of the 
nonprespecified composite end point of cerebral 
events (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.90; 
P = 0.02), but these results were not adjusted for 
multiple testing. A post hoc CPAP dose–response

analysis of the primary and secondary cardio- 
vascular end points showed no significant asso- 
ciation. 
The reductions from baseline in sleepiness and 
other symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea were 
greater in the CPAP group than in the usual-care 
group (estimated mean between-group difference 
in the change from baseline in Epworth Sleepi- 
ness Scale score, −2.5; 95% CI, −2.8 to −2.2; 
P<0.001) (Table 3). Greater reductions from 
baseline in the anxiety and depression subscale 
scores of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
Scale were also observed in the CPAP group 
than in the usual-care group (Table 3), and the 
percentage of patients with clinically relevant 
depression scores was 25 to 30% lower in the 
CPAP group than in the usual-care group at the 
end of follow-up. The CPAP group had greater 
improvement in scores on the physical and 
mental subscales of the SF-36 than the usual- 
care group (Table 3), as well as fewer days off 
from work because of poor health (a nonpre- 
specified end point) than the usual-care group 
(Table 4). The number of serious adverse events 
and the rate of road-traffic accidents and acci- 
dents causing injury did not differ significantly 
between the two groups (Table 4). (Further de- 
tails on the results for the secondary and other 

















































Participants in the SAVE study who were as- 
signed to CPAP adhered to the treatment for a 
mean of 3.3 hours per night over several years, 
which is similar to the mean adherence in other 
reports of CPAP use in patients who had no or 
minimal daytime sleepiness29,30 and which is 
consistent with CPAP use in clinical practice.31 
However, although this overall level of adher- 
ence to CPAP therapy exceeded the estimates in 
our power calculations, it may still have been 
insufficient to provide the level of effect on car- 
diovascular outcomes that had been hypothe- 
sized. For practical reasons and to ensure effi- 
cient recruitment and consistency of data across 
multiple sites, we used a simple screening device 
(ApneaLink) that was based on oximetry and 
nasal pressure recordings and used automated 
algorithms to analyze signals, rather than the 
conventional standard test for obstructive sleep 
apnea in which polysomnographic data from an 
overnight stay in a hospital or clinic are scored 
manually. The ApneaLink screening device has 
been shown to be a reliable method for diagnosing 
moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea.32,33 To 
mitigate the risk of recruiting patients with pre- 
end points are provided in Figs. S4 and S5 and 
Tables S8 and S12 through S16 in the Supple- 
mentary Appendix.) 

This secondary prevention trial in adults with 
cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea 
showed that the risk of serious cardiovascular 
events was not lower among patients who re- 
ceived treatment with CPAP in addition to usual 
care than among those who received usual care 
alone. Treatment with CPAP was associated with 
a greater reduction in symptoms of daytime 
sleepiness and with improved health-related qual- 
ity of life, mood, and attendance at work. This 
study was not powered to provide definitive an- 
swers regarding the effects of CPAP on second- 
ary cardiovascular end points, but there was no 
indication of a significant benefit with respect 
to any cause-specific cardiovascular outcome. 
Three other randomized trials have investi- 
gated the effect of CPAP on cardiovascular end 
points in patients with obstructive sleep ap- 
nea.26-28 Two studies — a multicenter study con- 
ducted in Spain that compared CPAP with usual 
care in 725 patients with obstructive sleep apnea 
who did not have prior cardiovascular disease26 
and a single-center study involving 224 patients 
with obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery 
disease who had just undergone revasculariza- 
tion28 — showed no difference in composite 
cardiovascular end points over several years of 
follow-up, although in adjusted analyses, both 
studies reported better outcomes among patients 
who were adherent to CPAP therapy (≥4 hours 
per night) than among patients who did not re- 
ceive CPAP or who used CPAP less than 4 hours 
per night. The third study involving 140 patients 
with recent ischemic stroke showed no effect of 
CPAP on event-free survival over 2 years.27 
One important potential limitation of our 
trial is that, for several of the participating coun- 
tries, the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea 
were not well established in clinical practice when 
the trial began. However, before trial recruitment, 
we expended substantial time and effort in con- 
ducting training workshops for investigators and 
study coordinators. In addition, extensive site 
monitoring was conducted throughout the trial 
to ensure a high standard of study conduct.

tive sleep apnea, we excluded patients with overt 
heart failure and patients in whom the nasal 
pressure signals showed a predominant pattern 
of Cheyne–Stokes respiration. 
In conclusion, in a large group of adults with 
both cardiovascular disease and moderate-to- 
severe obstructive sleep apnea, the use of CPAP 
therapy had no significant effect on the preven- 
tion of recurrent serious cardiovascular events, 
despite significantly reduced sleepiness and other 
symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea and im- 
proved quality-of-life measures.
