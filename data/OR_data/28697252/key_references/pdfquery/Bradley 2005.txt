background 
The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Patients with Central Sleep 
Apnea and Heart Failure trial tested the hypothesis that continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) would improve the survival rate without heart transplantation of pa- 
tients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure. 
methods 
After medical therapy was optimized, 258 patients who had heart failure (mean age 
[±SD], 63±10 years; ejection fraction, 24.5±7.7 percent) and central sleep apnea (num- 
ber of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep, 40±16) were randomly as- 
signed to receive CPAP (128 patients) or no CPAP (130 patients) and were followed 
for a mean of two years. During follow-up, sleep studies were conducted and measure- 
ments of the ejection fraction, exercise capacity, quality of life, and neurohormones 
were obtained. 
results 
Three months after undergoing randomization, the CPAP group, as compared with the 
control group, had greater reductions in the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypo- 
pnea (¡21±16 vs. –2±18 per hour, P<0.001) and in norepinephrine levels (¡1.03±1.84 
vs. 0.02±0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009), and greater increases in the mean nocturnal 
oxygen saturation (1.6±2.8 percent vs. 0.4±2.5 percent, P<0.001), ejection fraction 
(2.2±5.4 percent vs. 0.4±5.3 percent, P=0.02), and the distance walked in six minutes 
(20.0±55 vs. ¡0.8±64.8 m, P=0.016). There were no differences between the control 
group and the CPAP group in the number of hospitalizations, quality of life, or atrial 
natriuretic peptide levels. An early divergence in survival rates without heart transplan- 
tation favored the control group, but after 18 months the divergence favored the CPAP 
group, yet the overall event rates (death and heart transplantation) did not differ (32 vs. 
32 events, respectively; P=0.54). 
conclusions 
Although CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea, improved nocturnal oxygenation, in- 
creased the ejection fraction, lowered norepinephrine levels, and increased the distance 
walked in six minutes, it did not affect survival. Our data do not support the use of 
CPAP to extend life in patients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.

nervous system, and it independently increases the 
risk of death. 

In short-term, single-center randomized trials 
lasting one to three months involving small num- 
bers of patients who had central sleep apnea and 
chronic heart failure, continuous positive airway 
pressure (CPAP) attenuated the central sleep apnea, 
increased the left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF), reduced daytime levels of atrial natriuretic 
peptide and plasma norepinephrine, and improved 
the patients’ quality of life. 
 In one trial, among 
patients receiving CPAP, there was a trend toward 
5 
fewer deaths and heart transplantations. 
 However, 
that trial involved only 29 patients and was con- 
ducted before there was wide use of beta-blockers 
to treat heart failure. 

We therefore undertook a multicenter trial to 
test the hypothesis that long-term treatment of cen- 
tral sleep apnea with the use of CPAP in patients 
who have heart failure and are receiving optimal 
medical therapy reduces the combined rates of

study design 
The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure 
for Patients with Central Sleep Apnea and Heart 
Failure (CANPAP) trial was a randomized, open- 
label trial in which outcomes were evaluated at 11 
9 
 by investigators blinded to the treatment 
centers 
assignments. It was supported by a grant from the 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Uni- 
versity Industry Program (UI-14909) in partnership 
with Respironics, ResMed, and Tyco Healthcare. 
The sponsors had no role in the conception or de- 
sign of the study; the collection, analysis, or inter- 
pretation of the data; or the drafting or revision of 
the manuscript. The research ethics board of each

institution approved the protocol.

patients 
Candidates for participation in the trial included 
men and women 18 to 79 years of age who had 
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional 
class II through IV heart failure due to ischemic, 
hypertensive, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopa- 
thy and whose condition had been stabilized by 
means of optimal medical therapy for at least one 
month; an LVEF of less than 40 percent on radio- 
nuclide angiography; and central sleep apnea, de- 
fined as 15 or more episodes of apnea and hypo- 
pnea per hour of sleep, more than 50 percent of 
which were determined to be central rather than 
obstructive. The exclusion criteria were pregnan- 
cy, myocardial infarction, unstable angina or car- 
diac surgery within the previous three months, 
and obstructive sleep apnea. 



baseline assessment 
Eligible patients underwent clinical assessment fol- 
lowed by overnight polysomnography. Sleep stages 
and arousals, episodes of apnea and hypopnea, and 
the mean and lowest arterial oxygen saturation lev- 
els were assessed according to uniform methods at 
all centers. 
 Respiratory efforts were measured 
with the use of respiratory inductance plethysmog-

raphy, and airflow by nasal pressure. 
tral sleep apnea was defined as the absence of tidal 
volume for 10 or more seconds without thoraco- 
abdominal motion, 
 and central hypopnea as a re- 
duction of 50 percent or more in tidal volume from 
baseline for 10 or more seconds without airflow 
limitation, as detected with the measurement of 
nasal pressure.

fied as obstructive if there was out-of-phase motion

percent of the events determined to be central rather 
than obstructive .

indicating worse condition) 
 were then deter- 
mined. At three centers, the levels of atrial natri- 
uretic peptide and plasma norepinephrine were 
measured between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. 


randomization 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the 
control group, who continued to receive optimal 
 or to 
medical therapy for chronic heart failure, 
the treatment group, who received CPAP in addi- 
tion to the medical therapy. Randomization was 
performed by a computer-generated schedule in 
random blocks of four and six and was stratified 
according to study center and brand of CPAP de- 
vice. Treatment assignment was communicated to 
the study centers by the data management center 
after verification that the patient met all the eligibil- 
ity criteria. Patients assigned to CPAP underwent 
further randomization in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the 
devices (Respironics Remstar Pro, ResMed Sulli- 
van VII, or Tyco Healthcare GoodKnight 420S, re- 
spectively). The use of CPAP devices from three 
different companies was a consequence of the ar- 
rangements made for study funding. 
initiation of cpap 
CPAP was initiated over two to three nights, which 
the patients spent in an unmonitored sleep labora- 
4,7,8 
 starting at a pressure 
tory or a hospital bed, 
of 5 cm of water the first night, then increasing by 
2 to 3 cm of water over the next one or two nights 
until reaching a pressure of 10 cm of water (a level 
shown to attenuate central sleep apnea) 
 or the 
highest pressure tolerated. Patients were instruct- 
ed to use CPAP for at least six hours nightly at home 
during the trial. If necessary, the pressure was raised 
to 10 cm of water or the highest level tolerated at 
the follow-up visits at the end of month 1 or month 
3. At each follow-up visit, the number of hours dur- 
ing which CPAP was used was downloaded from a 
meter that measured the amount of time the mask 
was used. 

assessment of outcomes 
Clinical assessments were performed at one, three, 
and six months after randomization, and every six 
months thereafter. Polysomnography was per- 
formed at 3 and 24 months. LVEF, the distance 
walked in six minutes, and quality of life were as- 
sessed at 3, 6, and 24 months. At three centers, 
levels of plasma norepinephrine and atrial natri- 
uretic peptide were obtained at 3, 6, and 24 months. 
Patients were followed from randomization until 
death, heart transplantation, or the end of the study. 
The time and cause of death or time of heart trans- 
plantation were ascertained from medical records 
or death certificates and were verified by an end- 
point adjudication committee. 
To confirm previous evidence that CPAP attenu- 
ates central sleep apnea and improves cardiovascu- 
lar function after three months, we calculated the 
changes from baseline in the apnea–hypopnea in- 
dex, mean and minimum nocturnal oxygen satura- 
tion, LVEF, and levels of plasma norepinephrine 
and atrial natriuretic peptide at three months and 
 The pri- 
throughout the remainder of the trial. 
mary outcome was the combined rate of death from 
all causes and heart transplantation (the data were 
censored as of the date of transplantation). Sec- 
ondary outcomes included death alone and trans- 
plantation-free survival, with censoring of data on 
patients who dropped out, the number of hospital 
admissions confirmed on the basis of medical rec- 
ords, and changes from baseline in the distance 
walked in six minutes and in the quality of life. 

sample size 
The size of the sample for the primary outcome 
was calculated with the use of the log-rank test, as- 
suming an annual event rate of 24 percent in the 
 with a relative hazard ratio 
control group, 
for CPAP of 0.65. At a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, 
with 80 percent power, we estimated that 204 pa- 
tients per group would be required. 


statistical analysis 
Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to visualize 
survival without heart transplantation. Cox pro- 
portional-hazards analysis was used to compare 
transplantation-free survival between groups. The 
primary statistical analysis was according to the 
intention-to-treat principle. A secondary analysis 
of this outcome, with data on those who dropped 
out censored as of the dropout date, was also per- 
formed. Generalized linear models for binomial 
and Poisson distributed outcomes were used to as- 
sess changes in the overall event rate over time. 

Further analyses with the use of Cox propor- 
tional-hazards models examined the effects of in- 
teractions between the treatment assignment and 
compliance with the treatment, age, NYHA class, 
LVEF, cause of heart failure, medications, and body- 
mass index on the primary outcome. The number

of hospital admissions in the two groups were 
compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum 
test. For the analysis of repeated measurements of 
the secondary outcomes collected over time, we 
used a model of longitudinal data, and the mea- 
surements were compared between groups with the 
use of linear mixed-effects models, wherein we ex- 
amined interactions between time and treatment 
over the duration of the trial. We also analyzed sec- 
ondary outcomes a priori after three months, which 
was the point in the study for which we had the 
most complete follow-up data. All data analyses 
were performed with S-Plus 6.2 software (Insight- 
ful). All P values are two-sided. Continuous data 
are expressed as means ±SD, unless otherwise in- 
dicated. 
After the first 200 patients had been followed 
for a minimum of six months, the data and safety 
monitoring committee performed a prespecified 
interim analysis. It recommended termination of 
the study because of an early divergence of the 
transplantation-free survival curves favoring the 
control group, enrollment at only 50 percent of 
the predicted rate, and a falling rate of death and 
heart transplantation that precluded the ability to 
detect a difference in the primary outcome between 
the two groups with the originally predicted sam- 
ple size. On the basis of this recommendation, 
the executive committee stopped the trial on May 
21, 2004. 
patients 
Of 727 patients who were screened between De- 
cember 1998 and May 2004, 345 met the eligibility 
criteria, of whom 258 agreed to participate and 
underwent randomization: 130 patients were as- 
signed to the control group and 128 to the CPAP 
group. Table 1 shows the similarity in baseline 
characteristics of the two groups. Ninety-six per- 
cent of the patients were men, consistent with the 
epidemiology of heart failure in patients of a similar 
age 
 and with the predominance of men among 
those with heart failure who have central sleep ap- 
nea. 


The mean apnea–hypopnea index of 40 per hour 
indicates severe central sleep apnea. Although 
some misclassification of hypopnea is possible, the 
overwhelming predominance of episodes of cen- 
tral apnea and hypopnea makes overlap with main- 
ly obstructive sleep apnea unlikely (Table 1).

compliance and dropout rate 
During the course of the trial, 20 patients in each 
group (15.5 percent) dropped out, refusing further 
evaluation. In the CPAP group, the average number 
of hours of daily use of CPAP varied between 4.3 
hours during the first three months to 3.6 hours at 
one year and beyond. The CPAP averaged 8 to 9 cm 
of water at three months and beyond. 
effect of cpap on central sleep apnea 
and cardiovascular function 
At three months, the patients assigned to CPAP 
had a greater (50 percent) reduction in the apnea– 
hypopnea index than those in the control group 
(¡21±16 vs. ¡2±18 per hr, P<0.001) (Fig. 1) and 
greater increases in mean oxygen saturation 
(1.6±2.8 percent vs. 0.4±2.5 percent, P<0.001) and 
minimum oxygen saturation (4.7±7.3 percent vs. 
0.9±6.0 percent, P<0.001) (Fig. 1). These changes 
were sustained throughout the trial. There were no 
changes in sleep time, distribution of sleep stages, 
or frequency of arousal in either group (P>0.19 for 
each variable). At three months, CPAP caused a 
greater increase in LVEF (2.2±5.4 percent vs. 
0.4±5.3 percent, P=0.02) (Fig. 1) and a greater 
reduction in levels of plasma norepinephrine 
(¡1.03±1.84 vs. 0.02±0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009) 
than did no intervention. These benefits were sus- 
tained for up to two years. CPAP had no significant 
effect on levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (P=0.64). 
primary outcome 
Collection of follow-up data on patients for the pri- 
mary end point stopped on May 21, 2004, when the 
trial was terminated by the executive committee. 
Primary outcome data were obtained for all pa- 
tients, including dropouts. The mean follow-up in- 
terval was 2 years (range, 0 to 64 months). The rate 
of the primary event decreased from 20 to 4 per 
100 person-years between 1998–1999 and 2004 
(P=0.003) (Fig. 2). This falling event rate was asso- 
ciated with a changing pattern of drug therapy.

During the same period, more patients were receiv- 
ing beta-blockers (a change from 58 percent to 86 
percent, P<0.001) and spironolactone (a change 
from 14 percent to 41 percent, P=0.001) and fewer 
patients were receiving digoxin (a change from 72 
percent to 36 percent, P=0.002) at the time of en- 
rollment. The use of beta-blockers and spironolac- 
tone also increased between the time of baseline 
assessment and the time of the last follow-up visit 
for the two groups (beta-blockers, from 77 percent 
to 83 percent, P<0.001; and spironolactone, from 
34 percent to 51 percent, P=0.04), but between the 
groups, the changes did not differ significantly 
(P>0.18 for each drug). 
During follow-up, there were 28 deaths and 
four heart transplantations in the control group 
and 27 deaths and five heart transplantations in the 
CPAP group. Most of the deaths were due to cardio- 
vascular causes (Table 2). In the proportional-haz- 
ards model, there was no difference in transplanta- 
tion-free survival between the control group and 
the CPAP group (hazard ratio for heart transplanta- 
tion, 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to 
1.90; P=0.54) (Fig. 3). However, the hazards ap- 
peared to be nonproportional during the follow-up 
period (chi-square=10.9, P=0.001). There was a 
divergence of event rates in the first 18 months fa- 
voring the control group (hazard ratio for an event, 
1.5; P=0.02) that was reversed after 18 months to 
favor CPAP (hazard ratio for an event, 0.66; P=0.06). 
The level of CPAP and the hours of use were not re- 
lated to the rate of the primary event. There was no 
significant interaction between treatment assign- 
ment and the seven variables included in the statis- 
tical analysis. A post hoc analysis did not detect any 
significant difference in the primary event rate 
among the three CPAP devices (P=0.31). 
secondary outcomes 
Death rates alone did not differ significantly be- 
tween the two groups of patients (hazard ratio for 
death, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 
1.88; P=0.714). With the use of a time-dependent 
covariate to indicate dropout, the analysis of survival 
among the patients who did drop out was found 
to be worse than among those who did not (haz- 
ard ratio for death, 3.8; P<0.001), with 10 events 
among the 20 dropouts from the CPAP group and 
9 events among the 20 dropouts from the control 
group. Neither overall transplantation-free survival 
(hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95 percent confidence 
interval, 0.78 to 1.4; P=0.778) nor survival dur- 
ing the first 18 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.4; 
P=0.10) differed significantly between patients in 
the control group and those in the CPAP group who 
remained in the trial. 
The number of hospitalizations did not differ 
significantly between the control group and the 
CPAP group (hospitalizations per patient per year, 
0.56±0.56 vs. 0.61±0.72; P=0.45). The distance

of death between the control group and the CPAP group 
or in cardiovascular causes of death (73 percent vs. 85 per- 
cent in the control group and the CPAP group, respective- 
ly; P=0.33). 
The primary event rate fell from 83 percent to 17 percent of the predicted rate

There was no difference in transplantation-free survival rates between the 
control group and the CPAP group (hazard ratio for transplantation-free sur- 
vival, 1.16; P=0.54). However, there was an early divergence in the event rates 
that favored the control group (hazard ratio for transplantation-free survival, 
1.5; P=0.02) that altered after 18 months to favor the CPAP group (hazard ra- 
tio for transplantation-free survival, 0.66; P=0.06).

the higher initial LVEF (24.5 percent vs. 20.0 per- 
cent) and the greater proportion of patients receiv- 
ing beta-blockers in the present trial (77 percent vs. 
<20 percent). Owing to the overlap in the effects of 
30 
beta-blockade and CPAP on ventricular function, 
the potential for further improvement in the LVEF 
when CPAP is added may be limited. The high rate 
of use of beta-blockers may also have reduced the 
potential for a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes. 
The early divergence of event rates that initially 
favored the control group but favored the CPAP 
group after 18 months was not anticipated (Fig. 3). 
It suggests that CPAP had an early adverse effect in 
some patients. Two possible reasons may be the 
effect of the dropouts and improvements in back- 
ground medical therapy. The early difference in 
transplantation-free survival between the control 
group and the CPAP group is diminished if it is cal- 
culated by excluding the patients who dropped out 
(among whom event rates were higher than among 
those who did not drop out). Background medical 
therapy is of importance, because the acute effect 
of CPAP in heart failure is a function of left ventric- 
walked in six minutes increased more in the CPAP 
group than in the control group at three months 
(20.0±55 vs. ¡0.8±64.8 m, P=0.016), but not over 
the whole study period; the average difference was 
11.1 m (95 percent confidence interval, ¡5.3 to 
27.5), favoring the CPAP group (P=0.18). Changes 
in patients’ scores on the Chronic Heart Failure 
Questionnaire did not differ significantly between 
the two groups. 

The CANPAP trial tested the effects of CPAP on 
morbidity and mortality among patients with cen- 
tral sleep apnea and chronic heart failure. The trial 
addressed two important issues: First, it confirmed 
the findings of previous small, short-term trials 
that CPAP attenuates central sleep apnea, improves 
nocturnal oxygenation and left ventricular systolic 
function, and lowers plasma norepinephrine lev- 
 and it showed that these effects are sus- 
els, 
tained with long-term therapy. Second, the trial 
failed to demonstrate any beneficial influence of 
CPAP on transplantation-free survival, number of 
hospitalizations, or quality of life. Therefore, al- 
though CPAP improved several physiological out- 
comes, this improvement did not translate into 
longer transplantation-free survival. CPAP did re- 
sult in an increase of 20 m in the distance walked in 
six minutes during the first three months of fol- 
low-up, but this improvement was not sustained. 

CPAP has been shown to improve cardiovascu- 
lar function in patients with heart failure who have 
central sleep apnea only when the treatment reduc-

upward-titration protocol. 
 This resulted in a 
significant reduction in the apnea–hypopnea index, 
which was accompanied by an increase in noctur- 
nal oxygen saturation that persisted for at least two 
years. Nonetheless, the reduction of 50 percent in 
the apnea–hypopnea index was less than had been 
achieved in previous trials with the use of similar

upward titration and CPAP pressures,

Improvement in daytime LVEF may be due to 
several factors, including a reduction in cardiac

ular preload: when filling pressures are high, the 
cardiac output increases, and when pressures are 
low, it decreases. 
 We cannot exclude the possibil- 
ity that upward titration of CPAP reduced cardiac 
output in some patients with low filling pressures, 
owing to more vigorous diuresis or other medical 
interventions. If so, a slower CPAP titration might 
have avoided some adverse events. 
In summary, CPAP attenuated central sleep ap- 
nea and improved nocturnal oxygenation, left ven- 
tricular function, sympathetic nervous activity, and 
(at least initially) submaximal exercise perfor- 
mance. However, the CANPAP trial did not demon- 
strate a beneficial effect of CPAP on morbidity or 
mortality in these patients with central sleep apnea 
and heart failure. Because of a declining primary 
event rate, which was possibly due in part to con- 
 it 
current improvements in drug therapy, 
would have required a trial three times the size of 
ours to determine whether the physiological im- 
provements observed were surrogates for clinically 
important outcomes. 
 Although the CANPAP trial 
ultimately lacked the power to conclude with cer- 
tainty that CPAP is ineffective in this patient popu- 


lation, our data do not support its routine use to 
extend life in patients with central sleep apnea and 
heart failure. However, this recommendation may 
not be applicable to patients with heart failure who 
have obstructive sleep apnea, the pathophysiology 
of which, arising from pharyngeal occlusion, dif- 
fers from that of central sleep apnea.

search (CIHR) through its University–Industry Program (UIP). In 
accordance with the policy of the UIP, one third of the funding was 
provided by the CIHR and two thirds was provided by the industry 
partners. Four industry partners each agreed to provide 25 percent 
of the industry contribution, including donation of its brand of 
CPAP device. One industry partner (Healthdyne) was acquired by an- 
other (Respironics), which provided 50 percent of the industry con- 
tribution. Supported also by a Senior Scientist Award from the Ca-

The Journal encourages investigators to register their clinical trials in a public trials 
registry. The members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
plan to consider clinical trials for publication only if they have been registered 
(see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1). The National Library of Medicine’s 
www.clinicaltrials.gov is a free registry, open to all investigators, that meets 
the committee’s requirements.
