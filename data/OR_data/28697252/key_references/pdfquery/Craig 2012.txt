ABSTRACT 
Background Continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) for symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) 
improves sleepiness and reduces vascular risk, but such 
treatment for the more prevalent, minimally symptomatic 
disease is contentious. 
Methods This multicentre, randomised controlled, 
parallel, hospital-based trial across the UK and Canada, 
recruited 391 patients with conﬁrmed OSA (oxygen 
desaturation index >7.5/h) but insufﬁcient symptoms to 
warrant CPAP therapy. Patients were randomised to 
6 months of auto-adjusting CPAP therapy, or standard 
care. Coprimary endpoints were change in Epworth 
Sleepiness Score (ESS) and predicted 5-year mortality 
using a cardiovascular risk score (components: age, sex, 
height, systolic blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, 
cholesterol, creatinine, left ventricular hypertrophy, 
previous myocardial infarction or stroke). Secondary 
endpoints included some of the individual components of 
the vascular risk score, objectively measured sleepiness 
and self-assessed health status. 
Results Of 391 patients randomised, 14 withdrew, 347 
attended for their follow-up visit at 6 months within the 
predeﬁned time window, of which 341 had complete 
ESS data (baseline mean 8.0, SD 4.3) and 310 had 
complete risk score data. 22% of patients in the CPAP 
group reported stopping treatment and overall median 
CPAP use was 2 : 39 h per night. CPAP signiﬁcantly 
improved subjective daytime sleepiness (adjusted 
treatment effect on ESS −2.0 (95% CI −2.6 to −1.4), 
p<0.0001), objectively measured sleepiness and self- 
assessed health status. CPAP did not improve the 5-year 
calculated vascular risk or any of its components. 
Conclusions In patients with minimally symptomatic 
OSA, CPAP can reduce subjective and objective daytime 
sleepiness, and improve self-assessed health status, but 
does not appear to improve calculated vascular risk. 
INTRODUCTION 
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) leads to recurrent 
hypoxic episodes, repeated arousals, surges in blood 
in some patients, excessive 
pressure (BP) and, 
daytime 
BP. 
and 
sleepiness 
Approximately 20–30% of the middle-aged popula- 
tion has some degree of OSA, most with few or 
no symptoms.1 2 Severity of sleepiness from OSA 



correlates poorly with sleep study severity of OSA.3 
This is likely due to inter-individual variation in the 
degree of brain arousal from apnoeas,4 the effect 
these arousals have on daytime function5 and an 
individual’s lifestyle. The UK National Institute for 
Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) concluded 
that only two papers, with conﬂicting results, looked 
at the beneﬁt of continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) at low levels of OSA symptom severity.6–8 
Thus one aim of the current study was to identify 
any symptomatic beneﬁt from CPAP in sleep clinic 
patients with apparently minimal symptoms. 
During each apnoea there are often recurrent 
hypoxic dips and surges in BP.9 These events may 
provoke sustained hypertension and several other 
potentially adverse cardiovascular consequences.10–16 
While the acute effects of OSA on BP are abolished 
by CPAP,9 any beneﬁcial effects on sustained hyper- 
tension appear to be limited mainly to the more 
severe and symptomatic patients, with little beneﬁt 
observed in non-sleepy patients in short-term rando- 
mised trials.6–8 Thus the second aim of this study 
was to assess the effect of 6 months of CPAP 
therapy on several potentially adverse vascular con- 
sequences, combined in an established calculated 
vascular risk algorithm in minimally symptomatic 
patients with OSA. 
METHODS 
Study design 
The Multicentre Obstructive 
Sleep Apnoea 
Interventional Cardiovascular trial (MOSAIC) was 
a randomised, parallel, 6-month controlled trial 
that was conducted between May 2006 and 
February 2010. There were 10 recruiting centres in 
the UK and Canada, with Oxford as the coordinat- 
ing centre. All centres are designated sleep units 
with facilities 
and 
for diagnosis, 
follow-up of patients with OSA, and have health- 
speciﬁcally trained in CPAP 
care professionals 
set-up and usage. The trial was approved by the 
ethics committees of all the centres (REC No: 05/ 
Q1604/159) and registered (ISRCTN 34164388). 

Patients 
Patients referred to sleep clinics, usually due to 
snoring, witnessed apnoeas or daytime sleepiness,

were assessed for eligibility and a screening log was kept. All 
patients were diagnosed with OSA using overnight respiratory 
polygraphy as standard in the participating centres. Patients 
were eligible if they were aged between 45 and 75 years, had 
proven OSA on the diagnostic sleep study, with >7.5 per hour 
oxygen desaturations of >4% (oxygen desaturation index, 
ODI), but had insufﬁcient daytime symptoms associated with 
OSA to warrant CPAP therapy. This decision followed a 
detailed discussion between physician and patient about the 
evidence for possible beneﬁts of CPAP versus the potentially 
lifelong nightly usage of a physical therapy. Thus patients with 
Epworth Sleepiness Scores (ESS) above the conventional upper 
normal limit (9) were included, when this was not accompan- 
ied by patient concerns. In addition, to ensure technical uni- 
formity of the ODI across centres, a second domiciliary, 
overnight, pulse-oximetry recording 
Inc, 
Osaka, Japan) was performed in all patients at baseline and at 
6 months. This was used as the trial ODI value, which could 
therefore be different from the entry ODI. All patients who 
gave informed consent did so in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice standards. 

Continuous positive airway pressure 
Patients assigned to CPAP were instructed in the use of an 
auto-adjusting CPAP machine (Autoset S8, ResMed, Abingdon, 
UK). Induction was by trained staff who were not involved in 
outcome assessments or data analysis. Humidiﬁcation and 
interface choices were made on an individual basis. All patients 
had one or more follow-up visits to download compliance data, 
check for residual apnoea/hypopnoeas and mask leakage, and 
to make any necessary adjustments. There were routine tele- 
phone calls at 2 and 4 months, and telephone advice and 
replacement parts if requested by the patient. 
Standard care 
The standard care (SC) group had an identical planned visit 
schedule to the CPAP group. Both groups were asked to con- 
tinue on their normal medication and not given any speciﬁc 
advice regarding diet and exercise. 
Outcomes 
The joint primary outcomes at 6 months (predeﬁned time 
window 5–8 months) were change in ESS, and change in a com- 
posite vascular risk endpoint, the 5-year risk of a fatal cardiovascu- 
lar event calculated using a cardiovascular risk score. Secondary 
outcomes at 6 months were change in objective sleepiness, self- 
assessed health status, BP, lipids, glucose metabolism, obesity mea- 
sures, vascular events and sleep apnoea severity (ODI). 
Assessments of sleepiness 
Subjective sleepiness was determined using the ESS,17 which 
assesses the tendency to fall asleep during eight typical 
daytime scenarios. Objective sleepiness was assessed using one 
Oxford Sleep Resistance (OSLER) test administered at the same 
time of day (Stowood Scientiﬁc Instruments Oxford, UK), a 
sleep resistance challenge which tests the ability to stay awake 
for 40 min in a quiet, darkened room.18 19 
Self-assessed health status 
The Medical Outcome Study, the 36-item Short-Form health 
survey (SF-36),20 the Calgary Sleep Apnoea Quality-of-Life 
Index (SAQLI)21 and the two-part Euroqol (EQ-5D) question- 
naires22 were administered by trial staff and are described in 
the online supplementary appendix. 


Cardiovascular risk score 
To avoid the problem of multiple comparisons, a calculated vascu- 
lar risk score was used as a composite endpoint, thus allowing the 
inclusion of relevant factors with their correct relative weightings 
(only some of which could potentially be affected by OSA or its 
treatment). The algorithm proposed by Pocock et al23 is similar to 
the Framingham risk score but estimates the probability of a fatal 
cardiovascular event within 5 years from 11 factors: age (at base- 
line), sex, height, systolic BP (median of a 7-day period), total 
cholesterol, creatinine, cigarette smoking (current smoker if 
smoked in the previous month), diabetes (either on treatment, 
previously diagnosed and in general practice records, or fasting 
glucose ≥7 mmol/litre and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >6.5%), 
left ventricular hypertrophy (Sokolov-Lyon method on ECG), 
history of cerebrovascular incident and/or myocardial infarction 
(from general practice records and veriﬁed from hospital case 
records if equivocal). Although some of these factors clearly could 
not change during follow-up (thus representing a ‘ﬁxed offset’), 
their inclusion is necessary to derive a valid single risk score with 
the correct weightings. 


RESULTS 
Flow diagram of trial allocation, implementation of 
intervention and baseline data 
Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁle. The trial was stopped nine 
patients short of the target of 400 because the number not 
attending for follow-up (4%) was lower than predicted (10%). 
Baseline data by group assignment are shown in table 1, and 
the baseline distribution of ESS scores by group assignment is 
shown in the online supplementary appendix (ﬁgure a). 
Primary outcomes 
Table 2 shows a summary of the adjusted treatment effects for 
the primary outcomes, including the results of the imputation 
and sensitivity analyses (further described in the online supple- 
mentary appendix). CPAP improved subjective sleepiness by a 
two-point reduction in the ESS scale compared with the SC 
group (95% CI −2.6 to –1.4; p<0.0001). There was a small, 
clinically insigniﬁcant, absolute increase of 0.1% in the 5-year 
risk of a fatal vascular event in the CPAP arm, relative to SC 
(95% CI 0.0% to +0.2%; p=0.070). The analyses of the compo- 
nents of the risk score in patients included in the primary risk 
score analysis are shown in table 3. 
Secondary outcomes 
Objective sleepiness 
The proportion of patients falling asleep during the 40 min 
OSLER test was similar in the two groups at baseline (39% and 
35% in the SC and CPAP group, respectively). At 6 months, the 
odds of falling asleep during the OSLER test were 44% lower in 
the CPAP treatment group compared with SC (95% CI −1 to 
−68%), p=0.045 (logistic regression). A ‘time to event’ (falling 
asleep) Kaplan–Meier plot of these data is shown in ﬁgure 2. 
Indices of self-assessed health status 
Most components of the SF-36 (except bodily pain, mental 
health and role physical) showed evidence of improvement fol- 
lowing CPAP (tables 4 and 5, ﬁgure 3). The largest treatment 
effect was in energy/vitality, +6.6 (95% CI +3.1 to +10.1),

p<0.0001. The mental component score improved by 2.6 
points (95% CI +0.9 to +4.2), p=0.003. The SAQLI also 
showed a statistically signiﬁcant improvement, but the small 
improvement in the Euroqol was not statistically signiﬁcant 
(see online supplementary appendix tables a and b). 
Other metabolic and vascular outcomes 
CPAP usage 
Forty-three (22%) of the 195 patients randomised to CPAP 
reported stopping treatment during follow-up (see online sup- 
plementary appendix, tables c and d). Of the 172 patients on 
CPAP who attended their 6-month visit ‘on time’ ( predeﬁned 
time window 5–8 months), 150 (87%) had compliance data at 
6 months. Median CPAP usage was 2 : 39 h/night (IQR 0 : 36 
to 4 : 59), with compliance in non-users with missing data set 
to zero. Including all the patients on CPAP in the analysis did 
not substantially alter this result (median 2 : 27 h/night (IQR 
0 : 28 to 4 : 55)). Age, sex, study centre and baseline ODI, ESS, 
body mass index, neck circumference and OSLER result were 
not predictive of CPAP compliance. Following the end of the 
6-month trial, 71% of patients randomised to CPAP expressed a 
wish to continue CPAP. 
Effect of CPAP usage on outcomes 
Figure 4A shows the effect of <4 h/night and ≥4 h/night of 
CPAP usage on change in ESS compared with SC. There was a 
statistically signiﬁcant 
in ESS with greater 
improvement 
CPAP compliance ( p=0.0001). The effect of CPAP usage on 
self-assessed health status outcomes are detailed in the online 
supplementary appendix (ﬁgure b). Figure 4B shows the effect 
of CPAP usage on change in 5-year vascular risk compared with 
SC. There is no evidence to suggest that good compliance 
(≥4 h/night) improved vascular risk compared with poor com- 
pliance (<4 h/night, p=0.49). The effect of CPAP usage on sys- 
tolic BP and HbA1c are detailed in the online supplementary 
appendix (ﬁgure c). The effect of CPAP usage on ODI is also 
shown in the online supplementary appendix (table c and 
ﬁgure g). 
Association of age, sex, ODI, baseline ESS and hypertensive status 
with outcomes 
The effect of CPAP therapy on ESS was largely independent of 
baseline ODI, age or sex (ﬁgure 5). There was some evidence 
that patients with ESS scores in the two quartiles above the 
median at baseline beneﬁtted more than those below the 
median. However, there was still a signiﬁcant treatment effect 
even in those in the lowest ESS quartile at baseline. The effect 
of CPAP therapy on 5-year vascular risk was independent of 
baseline ESS, ODI, age, sex and hypertensive status (ﬁgure 5). 
The effect of the above factors on systolic BP is detailed in the 
online supplementary appendix (ﬁgure d). The association 
between baseline ESS and change in diastolic BP and cholesterol 
are detailed in the online supplementary appendix (ﬁgures e 
and f ). 
DISCUSSION 
This study has shown that in minimally symptomatic patients 
with OSA, 6 months of CPAP therapy improves daytime

sleepiness and self-assessed health status, but does not improve 
the calculated 5-year risk of a fatal cardiovascular event, or any 
of its component parts. 
The individuals in this study were less sleepy than in the 
majority of previous randomised controlled studies on CPAP. In 
two of our previous comparable trials the mean baseline ESS of 
16, and the median baseline OSLER of 21 min, compares to 
about 8 and 40 min, respectively.24 25 The ESS improvement 
was seen across almost the whole spectrum of baseline ESS 
severity. Compared with SC, the number needed to treat for at 
least a two-point ESS improvement is about four (online sup- 
plementary appendix, table e). The fall in ESS of two points, 
relative to control, compares to a fall of about ﬁve points 
observed in one of our previous studies mentioned above.24 
Because the ESS scale is an ordinal, rather than a linear, 
measure of sleepiness, it is difﬁcult to compare changes at dif- 
ferent points across the spectrum. However, in the NICE eco- 
nomic model,26 a drop of 2.3 in ESS in patients treated with 
CPAP incurred a cost of £9331 and was considered economic- 
ally viable. This drop of two in ESS would be expected in 
theory to improve work productivity by about 2%27 and reduce 
sleep-related road accident rates by about 9%,28 further adding 
to the cost efﬁcacy of treatment. 
This effect of CPAP on sleepiness was also observed almost 
equally across the whole ODI spectrum, conﬁrming previous 
ﬁndings that the correlation between symptoms and apnoea- 
hypopnoea index (AHI), or ODI, is very poor. Nearly a quarter 
of patients started on CPAP in the current study admitted stop- 
ping therapy as they did not perceive beneﬁts to outweigh 
inconvenience. However, 71% stated at the 6-month appoint- 
ment that they wished to continue CPAP long term. This is 
similar to long-term CPAP take-up rates for patients with mod- 
erate OSA in many centres, including our own.29 30 From the 
baseline data we collected, there were no clear ways to predict 
in advance which individuals will beneﬁt from treatment 
(ﬁgure 5). 
We have also shown that self-assessed health status, as mea- 
sured by SF-36 and SAQLI, improves with CPAP in patients 
with minimally symptomatic OSA. A previous randomised 
controlled trial of self-assessed health status in severely sleepy 
subjects with OSA showed treatment effects of 0.9 in the 
SAQLI,31 and 14.5 in the Energy/Vitality component of SF-36, 
compared with the current trial of 0.6 and 6.6, respectively. 
This suggests that CPAP therapy in patients with minimally 
symptomatic OSA produces an improvement in self-assessed 
health status of 45–70% of that seen in severely sleepy 
patients. 
Despite the clear symptomatic response to CPAP there was, 
if anything, weak evidence that vascular risk slightly worsened

compared with SC, although the effect was clinically insigniﬁ- 
cant. This unimportant adverse effect was largely explained by 
small statistically non-signiﬁcant differential changes in both 
smoking status and BP (and its medication) over the 6 months 
(table 2). Change in vascular risk did not seem to be related to 
initial OSA severity, or CPAP compliance, implying that we 
probably did not miss an effect, simply because overall compli- 
ance with CPAP was low. However, in the subgroup of patients 
with higher baseline ESS values (>11), there was a trend 
towards an improvement in vascular risk with CPAP (ﬁgure 5). 
Similarly systolic and diastolic BP, and cholesterol did fall in the 
CPAP arm relative to the SC arm in patients with higher ESS 
(>11), although these interactions were not statistically signiﬁ- 
cant (online supplementary appendix, ﬁgures d–f ). The drop in 
cholesterol of 0.30 mmol/litre in our most sleepy patients was 
similar to the ﬁndings of a previous study showing a fall in 
cholesterol of 0.28 mmol/litre in a more severely affected and 
sleepy population (mean ESS 16) treated for 1 month with 
CPAP.11 This suggests that patients with greater sleepiness 
beneﬁt more than non-sleepy patients and supports previous 
ﬁndings.7 8 25 A randomised controlled 12-month study by 
Barbe et al32 in a hypertensive non-sleepy population showed a 
small 
and diastolic BP (1.9 and 
2.2 mm Hg, p=0.07 and p=0.0008, respectively), but a larger 
effect (3.7 and 3.5 mm Hg, p=0.007 and p=0.0001, respect- 
ively) in patients with the highest CPAP compliance (>5.6 h/ 
night) who also had the largest improvement in sleepiness. 
More recently, the same group33 studied non-sleepy patients 
without prior cardiovascular events (some with hypertension)

over a median of 4 years. Although there was no signiﬁcant 
overall reduction in new events ( predominantly new onset 
hypertension) in the CPAP group, the subgroup of patients pre- 
pared to use CPAP for >4 h/night did experience a reduction in 
vascular events. Interestingly, in both these trials the baseline 
AHI of the study population was higher (mean 45 and 39) 
than the ODI in our study (median 10), and thus these 
patients probably had worse OSA. 
As no sham CPAP was used in our control group, our results 
might merely be due to a placebo effect of CPAP, observed in 
previous short trials.24 25 However, as this was a 6-month trial, 
the placebo effect is likely to have diminished with time. In 
addition, previous studies employing sham CPAP did not gener- 
ate placebo effects with the OSLER test;24 yet we have demon- 
strated a signiﬁcant treatment effect on this objective measure 
of sleepiness. 
We adopted a clinical approach to setting up CPAP therapy, 
without overnight CPAP titration, which has become standard 
in many UK and European based sleep centres.34 We obtained 
relatively low CPAP compliance, probably representing the 
likely usage when such non-sleepy patients are offered CPAP, 
which may have lessened the chance of demonstrating an 
effect on vascular risk, although there was no beneﬁt in the 
sizeable subgroup of higher compliers. Similar to the current 
trial, CPAP compliance has been reported to be relatively low 
(2.9 h/night) in a study using overnight CPAP titration to 
establish an optimal pressure to abolish breathing irregularities 
in patients with mild OSA.35 However, the Spanish group has 
managed to achieve higher compliance levels in their trials on 
non-sleepy patients (deﬁned as ESS<10).32 33

adjusted treatment effects by 
continuous positive airway pressure 
(CPAP) compliance (<4 h/night and 
≥4 h/night), with tests for interactions, 
on (A) Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) 
and (B) vascular risk (%). 
It may be that the markers of cardiovascular risk included 
in the risk score are either too insensitive or unlikely to 
change in a 6-month period, and other markers such as 
endothelial function, sympathetic activity levels or circulating 
inﬂammatory markers may more 
sensitively reﬂect any 
risk reduction. However, short trials of 1-month duration in 
more severely affected patients have shown clear reductions 
in BP.25

quartiles of age, baseline oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and baseline ESS), and on vascular risk (%) (right panel, by baseline hypertensive status 
and quartiles of age, baseline ODI, baseline ESS). 







In conclusion, our ﬁndings show that even when there is 
little enthusiasm for CPAP by patient and physician, because of 
an apparent paucity of symptoms, nearly half of patients on 
CPAP experienced at least a two-point improvement in ESS. 
This positive treatment effect extends further down the spec- 
trum of OSA symptom severity than was previously thought, 
but it is difﬁcult to predict, at an individual 
level, which 
patients will beneﬁt. However, this positive treatment effect on 
symptoms was not accompanied by a reduction in calculated 
vascular risk or BP. Thus CPAP should be offered to patients 
with OSA, despite minimal daytime symptoms, on a trial 
basis, but with the expectation that some will decide that the 
beneﬁts do not justify the inconvenience and thus will return 
their equipment. Because this study was carried out in a 
general sleep clinic setting, it is therefore only applicable to 
mainstream sleep practice; the sleepiness and self-assessed 
health status beneﬁts should not be extrapolated to subjects 
with undiagnosed OSA in the general population who have not 
had cause to present to a sleep clinic.
