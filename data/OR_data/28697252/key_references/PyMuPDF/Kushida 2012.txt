Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
INTRODUCTION
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep-related 
breathing disorder estimated to affect more than 14 million 
Americans1; comprehensive data are lacking on the impact of 
OSA on the neurocognitive domains of attention and psycho-
motor function, learning and memory, and executive and fron-
tal-lobe function. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
therapy is in widespread use,2 yet its efficacy in providing sig-
nificant long-term neurocognitive and other functional benefits 
to OSA patients has not been systematically investigated. The

Study Objective: To determine the neurocognitive effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on patients with obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA).
Design, Setting, and Participants: The Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES) was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, 
2-arm, sham-controlled, multicenter trial conducted at 5 U.S. university, hospital, or private practices. Of 1,516 participants enrolled, 1,105 were 
randomized, and 1,098 participants diagnosed with OSA contributed to the analysis of the primary outcome measures.
Intervention: Active or sham CPAP
Measurements: Three neurocognitive variables, each representing a neurocognitive domain: Pathfinder Number Test-Total Time (attention and 
psychomotor function [A/P]), Buschke Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall (learning and memory [L/M]), and Sustained Working Memory Test-
Overall Mid-Day Score (executive and frontal-lobe function [E/F])
Results: The primary neurocognitive analyses showed a difference between groups for only the E/F variable at the 2 month CPAP visit, but no dif-
ference at the 6 month CPAP visit or for the A/P or L/M variables at either the 2 or 6 month visits. When stratified by measures of OSA severity (AHI 
or oxygen saturation parameters), the primary E/F variable and one secondary E/F neurocognitive variable revealed transient differences between 
study arms for those with the most severe OSA. Participants in the active CPAP group had a significantly greater ability to remain awake whether 
measured subjectively by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale or objectively by the maintenance of wakefulness test.
Conclusions: CPAP treatment improved both subjectively and objectively measured sleepiness, especially in individuals with severe OSA (AHI > 
30). CPAP use resulted in mild, transient improvement in the most sensitive measures of executive and frontal-lobe function for those with severe 
disease, which suggests the existence of a complex OSA-neurocognitive relationship.

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES) 
is a randomized, double-blind, 2-arm, sham-controlled, multi-
center, long-term (6 months) trial of CPAP therapy, designed 
to provide adequate statistical power to assess its efficacy on 
neurocognitive function in patients with OSA across a range of 
disease severity.
METHODS
Participants
APPLES was conducted at 5 Clinical Centers: Stanford Uni-
versity, Stanford, CA; University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ; Prov-
idence St. Mary Medical Center, Walla Walla, WA; St. Luke’s 
Hospital, Chesterfield, MO; and Brigham and Women’s Hospi-
tal, Boston, MA. The protocol3 was approved by the institutional 
review board (IRB) at each site; the first participant was enrolled 
in 11/2003 and the final completion month was 8/2008.
The inclusion criteria3 were a diagnosis of OSA4 with an 
apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 10 and age ≥ 18 years. The

primary exclusion criteria3 were: (1) prior OSA treatment with 
CPAP or surgery; (2) anyone in the household with current/past 
CPAP use; (3) sleepiness-related automobile accident within 
past year; (4) oxygen saturation < 75% for > 10% of the diag-
nostic polysomnogram (PSG) total sleep time; and/or (5) condi-
tions (including known neurocognitive impairment), disorders, 
medications, or substances that could potentially affect neuro-
cognitive function and/or alertness.
Study Design
Sample size3 was calculated to permit detection of treatment 
effects at least as large as those estimated from two pilot studies, 
with 90% power and a type I error rate of 5%. In the pilot studies, 
the Pathfinder Number Test had the smallest estimated effect size 
of 0.2, which translates to a difference of 26 msec in reaction time 
between the Active and Sham CPAP groups. Allowing for 3 in-
terim analyses and 20% dropout,5,6 this effect size provided a ran-
domization target of 1,100 participants (Appendix Section 1A).
The Data Coordinating Center (DCC) used a computerized 
permuted block design3 to randomize 1,105 participants to ac-
tive vs. sham CPAP (REMstar Pro, Philips Respironics, Inc.) 
devices; the sham CPAP device closely simulates the airflow 
through the exhalation port and the operating noise of the ac-
tive CPAP device.7 Randomization was stratified by gender, 
race (white vs. non-white), and OSA severity (mild, 10.0-15.0 
respiratory events per hour of sleep; moderate, 15.1-30.0; se-
vere, > 30; using American Academy of Sleep Medicine Task 
Force [1999] OSA diagnostic criteria).4 A biased coin (7:3) was 
implemented for blocks of 30 when the difference in percent-
age randomized to active vs. sham at a given site was > 7%. 
Participants and most personnel were blinded3 to treatment as-
signments, with the exception of site coordinators, PSG tech-
nologists, and the database administrator/data manager.
Participants were studied up to 6 months over 11 visits (Fig-
ure 1) and were compensated up to $500 for study completion. 
All data from sites were linked to a unique subject code and 
were securely transferred and archived by the DCC using a 
custom-designed Internet-based data management system that 
facilitated extensive quality control procedures.3
CPAP adherence3 was objectively assessed using Encore Pro 
SmartCard (Philips Respironics, Inc.) data. Site staff contacted 
participants twice within the first week after starting CPAP to 
ensure use and manage any problems, and regularly thereafter 
to discuss CPAP nonadherence (< 4 h of use/night).
Efficacy and Safety Evaluations
The primary outcomes3 were 3 neurocognitive variables, 
each representing a neurocognitive domain: (1) Pathfinder 
Number Test-Total Time (PFN-TOTL) assesses attention and 
psychomotor function (A/P), and comprises the total time for 
the participant to scan, locate, and connect numbers in sequence 
(computer analog of Trail Making Test Part A); (2) Buschke 
Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall (BSRT-SR)8 assesses 
verbal learning and memory (L/M), and consists of the total 
words recalled across 6 selective reminding trials; and (3) Sus-
tained Working Memory Test-Overall Mid-Day Index (SWMT-
OMD)9 assesses an executive and frontal-lobe function (E/F) 
component by requiring the participant to compare the spatial 
position of a stimulus with its position on a previous trial (n-
back test), pressing one button if the spatial position was the 
same as that on the previous trial or a second button if it dif-
fered. For SWMT-OMD, a behavioral (task performance) and 
2 electroencephalographic (task-related EEG [cortical activa-
tion] and resting EEG [alertness]) subindices are combined to 
yield an overall index indicating the degree of change from 
pre-treatment baseline for the midday test administration.9 The 
secondary outcomes3 were 7 neurocognitive and 2 sleepiness 
measures, the maintenance of wakefulness test (an objective 
test to assess participants’ ability to remain awake) and the 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (a questionnaire to assess subjective 
daytime sleepiness).
Each site had a blinded physician observer who assessed par-
ticipant safety3 throughout the study. The DCC monitored and 
reported safety data to the IRBs and Data and Safety Monitoring 
Board (DSMB). Stopping rules3 were developed for early effica-
cy10 in addition to safety (cardiovascular disease [CVD] and mo-
tor vehicle accidents [MVAs]); data were presented by blinded 
arm to the DSMB at each interim analysis (25%, 50%, and 75%).
Statistical Analyses
The protocol-specified primary comparison was the differ-
ence between slopes (active vs. sham) across time, but general-
ized estimating equations (GEE)11 could only be applied to one 
of the 3 primary outcomes (PFN-TOTL), due to: (1) an inad-
vertent difference in difficulty of the BSRT-SR form versions 
between baseline and subsequent administrations and (2) the 
SWMT-OMD provided as a change from baseline score (Ap-
pendix Section 1B). Therefore, after review of the GEE results, 
it was decided that generalized linear models (GLM) for by-
visit comparisons, generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) 
for repeated measures data, or parametric survival analyses 
for right-censored data be used to fit the primary outcomes for 
comparing means between study arms (Appendix Section 2B). 
Analyses for all 3 main outcomes were done with and without 
adjustment for baseline covariates. Post hoc CPAP adherence-
adjusted and retention-adjusted primary outcome analyses are 
described in Appendix Sections 7-8. Post hoc primary outcome 
analyses were also performed restricted to CPAP-adherent in-
dividuals using the same methods described above (Appendix 
Section 7). Post hoc oxygen saturation analyses used GLM; 
sleepiness analyses used 2-sample t-tests or Spearman correla-
tion coefficients (Appendix Section 2E-2G).
Comparison of AHI means between study arms by visits 
used 2-sample t-tests after Box-Cox transformation. CPAP 
adherence was analyzed as an outcome using a Kolmogorov-
Smirnov 2-sample test,12 χ2 test, or permutation test (Appen-
dix Sections 5A-5C). Agreement between blinded participant 
guesses and actual treatment assignment was estimated by a 
κ coefficient (Appendix Section 5D). Associations between 
sleepiness and CPAP adherence used Spearman correlation co-
efficients (Appendix Section 4A). Retention was analyzed as 
an outcome using a life-table method (Appendix Section 6A).
Following an a priori analysis plan, 7 secondary outcome 
neurocognitive variables were selected from an initial set of 12 
via independent component analysis (ICA).13 GLM or GLMM 
was used to regress each secondary outcome on study arm with 
adjustment for covariates (Appendix Section 3). Maintenance 
of wakefulness test analyses used a chop-lump test14 due to a

high frequency of scores at the 20-min ceiling. Regression anal-
yses for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale used GLM for an over-
dispersed binomial distribution. Safety analyses used GLM.
The DCC conducted all analyses (using SAS15 and R16). Hy-
pothesis testing was 2-tailed at a type I error rate of 3.07% for 
the primary neurocognitive analyses (due to interim tests) and a 
5% type I error rate for the remaining analyses. Intention-to-treat 
parameters, verification of model assumptions, and treatment of 
missing data are described in the Appendix Sections 1C-1E.
RESULTS
Baseline
Of 1,516 participants enrolled, 1,105 were randomized. 
Three participants had an AHI < 10 (following PSG quality 
control), and 4 had inadvertent exposure to both treatment con-
ditions. They were excluded from analyses, resulting in 1,098 
randomized participants (556 active, 542 sham; Figure 1). 
Baseline participant characteristics revealed an obese, predomi-
nantly white, male, highly educated sample, and the sleep study 
data are consistent with those of untreated OSA patients; further 
characteristics are discussed in a separate publication on the 
baseline analyses conducted for this study.17 Baseline data were 
similar between arms (Table 1); the only difference detected 
was that active participants were 1.4 years older on average.
Efficacy
Primary Neurocognitive Outcomes
For protocol-specified GEE analyses, no difference in 
slopes over time was detected for PFN-TOTL between arms 
(P = 0.8663) (Appendix Section 2A). Comparison of means 
(regression estimates) between arms revealed a difference for 
SWMT-OMD at the 2 month (2M) CPAP visit (active 0.035, 
sham -0.074, P = 0.0074; Table 2). No differences in means were 
detected between arms for SWMT-OMD at the 6 month (6M) 
CPAP visit, or for PFN-TOTL and BSRT-SR at either visit.
Effects of CPAP Adherence and Retention on Primary Outcome 
Analyses
CPAP adherence data (Appendix Section 5) for the partici-
pants’ entire follow-up duration revealed a difference in mean 
nightly CPAP usage between arms (active 4.2, sham 3.4 h, 
P < 0.001). Adherence was also analyzed for various durations 
(night, week, month, and 2 months) prior to the 2M and 6M 
visits; differences in means were detected between arms for all 
durations at both visits (e.g., week prior to 2M and 6M: active 
5.1, sham 4.1 h, P < 0.0001). Active participants adhered more 
by a standard criterion (≥ 4 h for > 70% of the nights) for all 
durations prior to both visits. A total of 55.3% of active partici-
pants correctly guessed their treatment assignment vs. 69.7% of 
sham participants (κ = 0.25, P < 0.0001). Participant retention 
at 6M differed between arms (active 79.7%, sham 74.4%, log-
rank P = 0.0363; Appendix Section 6). Based on these findings, 
primary outcomes were adjusted for adherence and retention.
When primary neurocognitive analyses were restricted to 
CPAP-adherent individuals (mean nightly active or sham CPAP 
adherence ≥ 4 h for the 2 months prior to each neurocognitive 
testing visit), no differences in means were detected between 
arms for any of the primary outcomes at any visit (2M SWMT-
OMD, estimated active mean minus sham mean = 0.088, 
P = 0.0892; Appendix Section 7). Restriction to the adherent 
population resulted in a smaller sample size (2M n = 511, 6M 
n = 413) and an imbalance for one baseline feature (mean IQ 
Verbal WASI was 2.5 units higher for sham than active at 6M, 
P = 0.0453) that was not present in the full population; however, 
the imbalance on baseline age that existed in the full population 
(Table 1) was not detectable in this subgroup (P ≥ 0.1366).
An analysis comparing baseline variables for the group of ad-
herent individuals vs. non- adherent individuals at both the 2M 
and 6M time points revealed significant differences in a number 
of baseline variables. Adherent individuals were older on aver-
age (2M 4.8 y older, P < 0.0001; 6M 5.4 y older, P < 0.0001), 
were more likely to be white (2M/6M P < 0.0001) and married 
(2M P = 0.0474, 6M P = 0.0161), and also had higher WASI IQ 
scores on average (e.g., IQFull4WASI: 2M 5.1 points higher, 
6M 4.5 points higher, P < 0.0001). Some differences in base-
line polysomnographic variables also emerged. On average, the 
group of CPAP-adherent individuals at 2M and 6M had a lower 
sleep efficiency percentage at baseline (2M 1.9% lower, P = 
0.0296; 6M 3.8% lower, P < 0.0001); and at 6M, adherers had a 
shorter total sleep time (15 min lower, P = 0.0011), longer sleep 
latency (4.2 min higher, P = 0.0063), longer REM latency (5.4 
min higher, P = 0.0221), and a lower percentage of stage 3 sleep 
(0.67% lower, P = 0.0424).
We also performed analyses that adjusted for the confound-
ing that could arise because participants selected their levels 
of adherence. Results for the primary outcomes remained un-
changed when compared at each of 9 different levels of mean 
adherence (0, 1, 2, …, 8 hours per night), with adjustment for 
possible confounding using generalized propensity scores. 
These adjusted analyses detected a difference in means between 
arms for SWMT-OMD at 2M for 3 and 4 h of mean adherence 
per night (P ≤ 0.044, Appendix Section 7).
Retention-adjusted primary outcome analyses (Appendix 
Section 8) revealed the tendency to discontinue (drop or dis-
qualification) from the study was associated with neurocogni-
tive change from baseline for the 2M/6M BSRT-SR and for the 
6M SWMT-OMD (P ≤ 0.0075); however, adjusting for these 
associations did not alter detection of treatment effects.
Effects of AHI, Oxygen Saturation, and Sleepiness on Primary 
Outcome Analyses
A significant difference was detected in AHI between active 
vs. sham CPAP groups at 2M (P < 0.0001) and 6M (P < 0.0001); 
no difference in AHI was detected between groups at baseline. 
Covariate-adjusted regression analyses detected a difference be-
tween arms in the 2M SWMT-OMD for only those participants 
with severe OSA at baseline (P = 0.0031) (Table 2). Additional 
analyses revealed that the only significant change in means 
between the 2M and 6M visits for the SWMT-OMD was for 
participants with severe OSA in the sham group (sham -0.150, 
P = 0.0132; Appendix Section 2D).
To assess whether baseline oxygen saturation may be corre-
lated with the neurocognitive response to CPAP,18 post hoc mean 
comparisons were made between the lower three %TSTO2 < 85 
quartiles vs. the upper quartile separately by visit and arm. For the 
SWMT-OMD, those in the upper quartile (lower oxygen satura-

Figure 1—Participant flow diagram. Study visits included: (1) Clinical Evaluation (CE) included informed consent, baseline testing and screening, and a 
medical examination by a study physician; (2) Training Sessions 1 and 2 (TS) consisted of neurocognitive test training, screening, and administration of 
psychological tests; (3) Diagnostic Polysomnography (PSG) Visit (DX PSG Visit) involved an overnight diagnostic sleep study, questionnaires, maintenance 
of wakefulness test (MWT), and the neurocognitive test battery; (4) CPAP Titration Visit (CT) included administration of questionnaires and an overnight CPAP 
titration PSG study conducted for both active and sham CPAP group participants to determine the optimal CPAP pressure for those in the active CPAP group; 
(5) CPAP Set-up Visit provided the participant with the active or sham CPAP device following the CPAP titration visit; (6) Two Month Post-CPAP Follow-Up 
Visit (2M CPAP Visit) represented a follow-up overnight CPAP titration PSG study, with questionnaires, psychological tests, MWT, and neurocognitive test 
battery; (7) Four Month Post-CPAP Follow-Up Visit (4M CPAP Visit) consisted of questionnaires and a follow-up appointment with a study physician that 
included a physical examination and discussion of CPAP adherence, protocol compliance, safety issues, and medication changes; (8) Six Month Post-CPAP 
Follow-Up Visit (6M CPAP Visit) used the same protocol as the 2M-CPAP Visit; (9) Additional Follow-Up Visit allowed the participant to discuss any issues 
or problems; (10) Exit Interview gave the participant an opportunity to initiate other OSA treatment options. ‡Excluded: participant removed from study “pre-
randomization” due to exclusion criteria (e.g., taking exclusionary medication); Withdrawn: participant quit study “pre-randomization” due to participant’s 
choice (e.g., too busy); Dropped: participant quit study “post-randomization” due to a participant-initiated decision (e.g., did not wish to continue with protocol); 
Disqualified: participant removed from study “post-randomization” due to a physician-initiated decision based on medical/safety reasons (e.g., following SAE 
based on opinion of Physician-Observer). All participants who dropped post-randomization were asked to continue with participant visits, even if they had 
discontinued therapy, based on our intention-to-treat study design. Participants who were disqualified for a medical/safety reason were asked to continue 
participant visits only after approval by the Site Director. On-Treatment: participant completed visits on originally assigned treatment condition; On-Study: 
participant completed visits, but may or may not be on originally assigned treatment condition.

tion) performed better than those in the lower 3 
quartiles (0.132 vs. 0.003, P = 0.0448; Appendix 
Section 2E) compared to baseline after 2 months 
on active CPAP. SWMT-OMD differences be-
tween quartiles were not detectable in 6M active 
participants or in 2M or 6M sham participants.
Active participants were significantly more 
alert than sham participants for the mainte-
nance of wakefulness test-mean sleep latency 
(MWT-MSL) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale-
Total Score (ESS-TS) at both visits (Table 3). 
Relative to sham, mean MWT-MSL scores only 
improved for those active participants with se-
vere OSA (2M P = 0.0002; 6M P = 0.0002), and 
mean ESS-TS scores only improved for those 
active participants with moderate and severe 
OSA at each visit (2M P = 0.0236, P = 0.0005; 
6M P = 0.0106, P = 0.0010). For active partici-
pants, greater CPAP adherence was associated 
with greater subjective alertness (ESS-TS; Ap-
pendix Section 4A). For subjectively sleepy 
participants (baseline ESS-TS > 10), average 
change from baseline differed between arms for 
6M SWMT-OMD (active 0.150, sham 0.014, 
P = 0.0433; Appendix Section 2F) but not for 
2M SWMT-OMD or the other primary out-
comes at 2M or 6M. No differences between 
arms in mean change from baseline were ob-
served for objectively sleepy participants (base-
line MWT-MSL ≤ 14.5); but for this subgroup, a 
mild correlation between changes from baseline 
for the MWT-MSL and the 2M SWMT-OMD 
was detected in the active group (SCC = 0.2084, 
P = 0.0395; Appendix Section 2G).
Secondary Neurocognitive Outcomes
The 7 variables selected using ICA were 
PFN-Reaction Time (reciprocal), Shifting At-
tention Test Discovery Condition-Number of 
Rule Changes, Psychomotor Vigilance Task 
(PVT)-Median Reaction Time (reciprocal), 
PVT-Mean Slowest 10% of Reaction Times 
(reciprocal), 
BSRT 
Delayed 
Recall-Total 
Recall, SWMT-Mid-Day Behavioral Index 
(SWMT-BMD), and SWMT-Mid-Day Activa-
tion Index (SWMT-AMD). Baseline covari-
ate-adjusted regression models found active 
participants with severe OSA at 2M had better 
mean SWMT-BMD change scores from baseline (active 0.205, 
sham 0.011, P = 0.0031). Less attentional effort9 during task 
performance compared to baseline (SWMT-AMD electrophysi-
ologic score) was detected for active participants with mild 
OSA at 2M (active -0.050, sham 0.317, P = 0.0450). No dif-
ferences in means between arms were observed for any other 
secondary outcomes (Appendix Section 3).
Safety
Incidence proportions for participants with ≥ 1 post-ran-
domization serious adverse events were CVD: active 0.00719, 
sham 0.01107, P = 0.504; MVA: no SAEs; and deaths: active 
0.00360, sham 0.00369, P = 0.9797 (Appendix Section 9).
DISCUSSION
Limitations in the research on OSA and neurocognitive 
function include inconsistent findings, small sample sizes, non-
comprehensive test batteries, inadequate control groups, and 
short treatment durations.19-35 APPLES was designed to address 
these limitations by assessing the sham-controlled, long-term 
efficacy of CPAP therapy on neurocognitive function in a study 
with comprehensive tests of major neurocognitive domains and

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
ables in participants with an AHI > 30 (se-
vere OSA) at the 2M visit. Dividing patients 
into quartiles by baseline oxygenation also 
showed short-term improvement in the active 
arm at the 2M visit for the primary E/F vari-
able. These results suggest disease severity 
may be important for detecting improvement 
in neurocognitive outcomes. As measures of 
disease severity, both AHI30,36 and oxygen 
saturation have been previously implicated 
in the etiology of the OSA-associated neuro-
cognitive dysfunction. Although some stud-
ies on OSA36 and hypoxemic patients37 failed 
to find a relationship between measures of 
oxygen saturation and neurocognitive func-
tion, others,38 including the large-scale Sleep 
Heart Health Study,18 reported that OSA 
patients with decreased oxygen saturation 
were more cognitively impaired compared to 
those without significant desaturations. Ad-
ditionally, baseline analyses of the APPLES 
population found that severity of oxygen de-
saturation was weakly associated with worse 
neurocognitive performance on some mea-
sures of intelligence, attention, and process-
ing speed.17
CPAP has been demonstrated to improve 
OSA-related sleepiness.39 We found that ac-
tive participants were less sleepy, whether 
measured by an objective (MWT-MSL) or 
subjective (ESS-TS) measure, and partici-
pants with more severe OSA benefited the 
most from active CPAP. In a subgroup of 
those who were sleepy at baseline, change 
from baseline in the E/F measure was signifi-
cantly different on average between arms for 
subjectively sleepy individuals at 6 months 
and was correlated with change in objective 
sleepiness at 2 months, suggesting sleepiness may be associated 
with one domain of OSA-related neurocognition.
To address whether CPAP may only improve cognition in 
CPAP-compliant individuals, we repeated the primary outcome 
analyses restricted to a CPAP-adherent group. That subgroup 
analysis no longer detected a difference in means between arms 
for any of the primary outcomes at any visit. These analyses 
are difficult to interpret due to a smaller sample size, a differ-
ence in mean baseline IQ Verbal WASI between sham and ac-
tive CPAP in this self-selected subpopulation, and differences 
in several baseline features between adherent and non-adherent 
individuals. Interestingly, baseline features associated with bet-
ter adherence included increased age, higher IQ, white ethnic-
ity, being married, and poorer sleep quality (e.g., decreased 
sleep efficiency, longer sleep onset, longer REM onset). When 
we performed an adjustment for potential baseline confound-
ers between CPAP adherence and 1NC outcomes, the study’s 
primary findings remained unchanged, although we recognize 
that additional analyses remain to be performed to explore oth-
er methods of adjustment for variable adherence and retention 
(Appendix Section 7E).
The detection of CPAP effects for only the primary E/F vari-
able suggests this test is a more sensitive measure for subtle 
neurocognitive changes in that it combines a cognitive task 
with simultaneous EEG measures of brain function. However, 
the fact that these effects could only be detected at 2 months, 
that there was some evidence for worsening in the sham arm at 
2 months, that circadian confounding may have been present 
(Appendix Section 1B), and that effects of CPAP were minor 
compared to effects of caffeine or diphenhydramine40-42 on this 
measure in other studies must be considered in interpreting the 
significance of this finding. Further, given the number of statis-
tical tests conducted, these findings may reflect type 1 statistical 
error (Appendix Section 2C).
There are limitations related to the study sample. Although 
participants with severe OSA were included, those who had 
the lowest oxygen saturation, significant sleepiness including 
a history of sleepiness-related accidents, or major cardiac co-
morbidities were excluded from participation. Participants also 
willingly deferred effective treatment for up to 6 months in the 
sham arm; a majority of these participants were recruited from 
advertisements rather than clinically referred for OSA; and

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
participants had lower CPAP adherence than expected despite 
close follow-up to troubleshoot and encourage adherence in our 
participants. A majority of sham participants correctly guessed 
their treatment assignment. These factors collectively may have 
resulted in a sample with relatively lower susceptibility to the 
neurocognitive effects of OSA and a subsequent reduced re-
sponse to treatment.
In summary, active CPAP improved the primary measure of 
E/F at 2 months, and for those participants with severe OSA, 
improved both the primary and two secondary measures of 
E/F at the same time point of the study. There is evidence that 
deficits in neurobehavioral function vary significantly between 
individuals, are stable within individuals, and may involve a 
trait-like vulnerability to impairment from sleep loss.43 The 
cognitive reserve theory may also be relevant for our findings; 
individual differences in how the brain processes tasks may al-
low some to cope with greater insult by using preexisting cog-
nitive processes or by enlisting compensatory processes before 
performance is detrimentally impacted.44 While it is possible 
that our intelligent population (WASI IQ) may have had less 
neurocognitive impairment due to OSA because they had more 
cognitive reserve, resulting in their ability to maintain perfor-
mance, adjusting for WASI IQ in the models did not change the 
results. It is also possible that the lengthy list of baseline covari-
ates we tested is not properly aligned with more complex neu-
rocognitive traits; perhaps neurocognitive testing incorporating 
advanced electroencephalographic and imaging technology 
will be necessary to identify potential changes in neurocogni-
tive outcomes in OSA patients. We believe this study supports 
the theory that OSA is a multifaceted disorder with many co-
morbidities and outcomes; we believe that the mixed results 
from prior studies and the limited effect of CPAP on E/F mea-
sures of neurocognition in this study suggest the existence of a 
complex OSA-neurocognitive relationship, and that clinicians 
should consider disease severity, sleepiness, and individual dif-
ferences including treatment adherence in managing their pa-
tients with CPAP.

SECTION 1. APPLES STUDY DESIGN
1A. Sample Size Calculations
Two pilot studies1 were completed at Stanford University 
with a total of 16 participants (14 men and 2 women, aged 28-
65 years). Eight participants were assigned, in random order, 
to active CPAP and 8 to sham CPAP. These pilot studies dem-
onstrated the feasibility of the methods that were employed in 
APPLES and provided preliminary data used in our sample size 
calculations.
Sample size was calculated to permit detection of treatment 
effects at least as large as those estimated from the two pilot 
studies (n = 16) with 90% power and a type I error rate of 5%. 
The APPLES sample size was based on pilot study results for 
the Pathfinder Number Test because this test required the largest 
sample size (Table S1) among the 3 primary outcome measures. 
Allowing for 3 interim analyses and a 20% dropout (estimated 
based on our clinical research experience and 2 studies measur-
ing long-term CPAP adherence)2,3 resulted in a randomization 
target of 1,100 total participants.
The following are additional justifications as to why 1,100 
participants are necessary for this study (from APPLES Proto-
col Section 6.6):
1.	 Large sample sizes are needed for neurocognitive out-
comes in CPAP-treated OSA subjects.
	
Although the effect sizes for impairment in various cog-
nitive domains reported by Engleman and colleagues4 
ranged from ≤ 0.3 to > 3.0, most studies found effect 
sizes < 0.3. Although the sum of the two pilot studies 
consisted of a limited sample size of eight subjects in 
each treatment arm, we found a range of effect sizes 
(0.20 to 2.46) similar to those found by Engleman and 
colleagues in their review. Smaller effect sizes require 
larger sample sizes to achieve statistical significance. 
We estimate an effect size of 0.2 for the Pathfinder 
Number Test. The effect size of 0.2 translates to the 
clinically significant difference of 26 msec in reaction 
time between the Active and Sham CPAP groups for this 
test. An effect size ≥ 0.2 also translates to clinically sig-
nificant differences between the groups for the other two 
primary outcome measures.
2.	 We are examining neurocognitive outcomes in response 
to CPAP therapy for a wide spectrum of OSA severity.
	
The effect sizes previously reported were typically re-
lated to patients with a limited severity range of OSA; 
the more severe the case of OSA, the greater the neu-
rocognitive impairment.5,6 Since our study will include 
subjects varying over the entire range of OSA severity, 
we need a larger sample size than would be indicated by 
the prior studies.
3.	 Prior studies had small sample sizes and showed con-
flicting results.
	
The majority of case-control or randomized controlled 
studies evaluating neurocognitive function and OSA 
had sample sizes < 50 OSA subjects. The conflicting 
results of these studies could be due to the following: 
a) low sample sizes, b) tests in any one study did not 
cover a range of neurocognitive domains, and c) lack of 
multiple measures within each neurocognitive domain. 
Our study will avoid these methodological limitations 
through a large sample size and multiple measures with-
in several neurocognitive domains.
4.	 Secondary neurocognitive outcome measures will also 
be explored.
	
Based on prior smaller studies, CPAP treatment was 
shown to improve various domains of neurocognitive 
function in a clinically important way. Treatments will 
be compared statistically for these secondary neurocog-
nitive outcome measures.
Pilot Studies – Results (from APPLES Protocol Section 3.3.2)
The main results from the pilot studies are summarized 
in Table S1. There was a wide variability in the therapeutic 
effect sizes for changes in neurocognitive function, ranging 
from small (0.01) to large (1.32). For the SWMT, we fo-
cused our analysis on the third test interval, which occurred 
at 2:30 pm. The effect of active vs. sham CPAP therapy was 
examined for a number of behavioral and EEG variables in-
dependently. A summary behavioral measure from the task 
improved in the active CPAP group whereas the sham group 
showed a small decrease on the same measure, resulting in 
a treatment effect size of 0.62 (P = 0.38). Similarly, the ac-
tive CPAP group showed a decrease in an electrophysiologic 
variable associated with drowsiness, whereas the sham group 
showed an increase in the same variable, resulting in a treat-
ment effect size of 1.32 (P = 0.03).

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
In addition to examination of the neurophysiological and 
behavioral variables in isolation, we also used a composite in-
dex. This index can serve as a summary measure for the degree 
of change in each patient following treatment. The index was 
weighted so that positive index values reflect relatively greater 
alertness in the post-treatment condition, negative values reflect 
relatively lower post-treatment alertness and zero reflects no 
change. On average, the active group showed improved alert-
ness on this measure whereas the sham group showed decreased 
alertness, resulting in an effect size of 1.01 (P = 0.08). Five of 
the 8 subjects in the active CPAP group had positive scores, 
indicative of improved alertness, whereas 6 of the 8 subjects 
in the sham CPAP group had negative scores. Examination of 
the individual subject data suggests that the direction of change 
indicated on the SWMT composite index is in good agreement 
with the data from the other measures.
Other measures of neurocognitive function were also used 
to assess changes in attention and psychomotor function, learn-
ing and memory, as well as executive and frontal-lobe function. 
With respect to attention and psychomotor function, the effect 
sizes ranged from 0.01 to 1.02. The active group showed trends 
toward greater improvement compared to the sham group. For 
measures of learning and memory, the effect sizes ranged from 
0.26 to 0.40, with an effect size of 0.26 for the BSRT; there 
was a significant difference for the active group between their 
baseline and post-CPAP values. For measures of executive and 
frontal-lobe function, the effect sizes ranged from 0.14 to 1.32.
1B. Primary Neurocognitive Outcome Analyses
The per-protocol intention-to-treat analyses7 specified that 
all primary efficacy outcomes be regressed on study arm, days 
since randomization, and their interaction using generalized es-
timating equations (GEE)8 to account for the repeated measures 
on participants over time; the primary comparison was the dif-
ference between slopes (active vs. sham) across time.
Upon presenting these initial analyses to the SC it was deter-
mined that the GEE method outlined in the protocol could not be 
applied across the Baseline, 2M and 6M visits for all three pri-
mary outcomes. SC decided that generalized regression models 
(generalized linear models [GLM] or generalized linear mixed 
models [GLMM]) be alternatively fit to the primary outcomes.
For CogScreen Pathfinder Number-Total Time (PFN-
TOTL), repeated measure mean comparisons were estimated 
by GLMM.
For the Buschke Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall 
(BSRT-SR), a difference was identified in the difficulty of the 
form versions9 between baseline and the 2 or 6 month adminis-
trations; therefore, the Steering Committee (SC) voted that com-
parisons could not be made across the three visits. Instead, SC 
specified that comparisons be conducted separately for each post-
randomization visit using GLM. For covariate-adjusted analyses, 
the baseline BSRT-SR score was included as a covariate.
Sustained Working Memory Test-Overall Mid-day In-
dex (SWMT-OMD) was provided as a change-from-baseline 
score. SC voted that comparisons could not be made across 
the three visits based on the structure of this variable. Instead, 
comparison was of mean change-from-baseline score by vis-
it, as estimated by a GLM fit to the dataset for 2M and 6M. 
The change-from-baseline score was formulated to compare 
the mid-day measurement at each follow-up visit (2M, 6M) 
against the combination of the morning, mid-day, and afternoon 
measurements at baseline, which advances the possibility that 
change scores may be confounded with diurnal variation.
1C. Intention-to-Treat Parameters
The protocol specified that analyses be conducted in accor-
dance with the intention-to-treat principle.10,11 On this basis, all 
participants who dropped (due to a participant-initiated deci-
sion) or were disqualified (due to a physician-initiated decision 
based on medical/safety reasons) were invited to continue at-
tending study visits and provide protocol-specified data, even if 
they discontinued their originally assigned therapy. As a result, 
an individual analyzed as active may not have used CPAP at 
all or an individual analyzed as sham either may not have used 
CPAP (sham or active) at all or used active CPAP for a portion 
of the intervention period. All analyses were performed strictly 
based on the participants’ original randomization assignments, 
with the exception of seven participants (3 had an AHI < 10 and 
were excluded after PSG quality control, and 4 had inadvertent 
exposure to both treatment conditions as a result of staff error 
rather than participant choice; the decisions to exclude these 
participants were made by SC). Quantities of participants On-
Treatment (completed visits on originally assigned treatment 
condition) vs. On-Study (completed visits, but may or may not 
have been on originally assigned treatment condition) are re-
ported in Figure 1 of the manuscript.
Another aspect of the intention-to-treat principle regards 
inclusion of individuals who were randomized but only com-
pleted a baseline visit with no post-randomization follow-up 
visits. For the primary neurocognitive outcomes, the protocol 
specified that all three visits were to be used together in a 
longitudinal regression analysis with GEE. This analysis in-
cluded participants who had only a baseline visit, and was 
the analysis employed for PFN-TOTL. For BSRT-SR, analy-
ses were run separately by visit due to differences in forms 
between visits (see Section 1B). Here, participants who only 
had a baseline visit were included in the means comparison 
between arms at baseline. For SWMT-OMD, the data were 
provided as a change score. As a result, participants who only 
had a baseline visit were excluded from this analysis (see Sec-
tion 1B). The retention-adjusted analyses were formulated as 
a change-from-baseline variable for all three primary neuro-
cognitive findings. When allowance was made for potentially 
informative dropout via selection modeling, results for the 
primary neurocognitive outcomes remain unchanged from 
the results reported in the main paper without this adjust-
ment. The secondary neurocognitive analysis plan specified 
that all three visits were to be used together in a longitudinal 
mixed-model regression (GLMM). This was done for Cog-
Screen Shifting Attention Test Discovery Condition- Rule 
Changes Completed Dichotomized (SAT-DIRUL), CogScreen 
Pathfinder Number-Reaction Time (PFN-RTC), Psychomotor 
Vigilance Task-Mean Slowest 10% of Reaction Times (PVT-
MSRT), and PVT Median RT (PVT-MDRT); so that partici-
pants who only had a baseline visit were included in these 
analyses. As with BSRT-SR, analyses of BSRT Delayed Re-
call (BSRT-DR) were performed by visit for each of the three 
visits. The SWMT-Activation Index: Mid-day (SWMT-AMD) 

SLEEP, Vol. 35, No. 12, 2012
1602D
Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
and SWMT-Behavioral Index: Mid-day (SWMT-BMD) were 
provided as change from baseline scores; so analyses of these 
two secondary outcomes excluded those participants who 
only had a baseline visit.
1D. Assessing Model Assumptions
For all GEE, GLMM and GLM analyses for both the pri-
mary and secondary neurocognitive analyses, we checked 
variance and link assumptions.12 Residuals were plotted 
against fitted values and against model covariates to ensure 
that a given model was not misspecified. This procedure also 
provided a final check on data quality to confirm no outliers 
existed in these data. Influence diagnostics were performed 
as needed to assess model fit. In some cases, polynomial 
terms (up to cubic) for continuous covariates were added to 
improve fit.
For the primary neurocognitive parametric survival model fit 
to PFN-TOTL, model fit was assessed via simulating data from 
the fitted model and comparing observed data versus simulated 
values. For GLMM, we employed a random intercept for each 
participant and assessed if random effects were approximately 
normally distributed. GLMM fitting employed adaptive gauss-
ian quadrature. For GLMM analyses of the secondary neuro-
cognitive variables SAT-DIRUL, PFN-RTC, PVT-MSRT, and 
PVT-MDRT, data were centered and scaled to aid algorithm 
convergence.
1E. Treatment of Missing Data
GEE (Section 2A) assumed data were missing completely 
at random (MCAR). GLM and GLMM (Sections 2 and 3) as-
sumed that data were missing at random (MAR). MAR and 
MCAR13 are both types of missingness that assume that data 
are missing for reasons unrelated to the outcome that would 
have been observed.
We addressed the possibility that missingness depends upon 
a person’s outcome through the retention-adjusted analyses 
(Section 8). Those analyses provide some evidence for infor-
mative missingness in that change from baseline for some of 
the primary neurocognitive outcomes are correlated with ten-
dency to discontinue. However, we found that adjusting for 
this through the use of Heckman-type selection models did not 
change the primary efficacy findings.
No imputation was performed except for the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov two-sample test analysis of adherence as outcome 
(Section 5A), where one version imputed missing values to ze-
ros before calculating mean per person. Imputing missing to 
zero did not change findings from the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
two-sample test.
In tables, figures, and text, reported sample sizes that don’t 
sum to the entire randomized sample size of 1,098, this dispar-
ity was due to missing data in outcomes and/or covariates. See 
Section 6 on participant retention for additional details.
SECTION 2. RESULTS – PRIMARY NEUROCOGNITIVE DATA
2A. Per-Protocol GEE Regression Analyses for Primary 
Neurocognitive Outcomes
The per-Protocol GEE analysis for the PFN-TOTL variable 
is presented in Figure S1. This outcome was regressed on study 
arm, days since randomization, and interaction using GEE. We 
tested the hypothesis that the slope over time (DX, 2M, 6M) 
differed between study arms (P = 0.8663).
No GEE models testing slope over time were fit for BSRT-
SR or SWMT-OMD (see Section 1B).
2B. GLM, GLMM, and Parametric Survival Analyses
In general, GLM were used for by-visit comparisons and 
GLMM were used to model repeated measures data. All means 
reported from GLM and GLMM are least-squares means cen-
tered at the mean values of all continuous covariates and at 
observed marginal frequencies of categorical variables.14 
Parametric survival analyses were conducted on PFN-TOTL 
for by-visit comparisons since these data were right censored 
at 60. Assessment of model assumptions was addressed in 
Section 1D and treatment of missing data was reviewed in 
Section 1E.
For unadjusted analyses a parametric survival analysis was 
run for PFN-TOTL and GLM analyses were run by visit (2M 
and 6M) for BSRT-SR and SWMT-OMD.
For covariate adjusted analyses, parametric GLMM analy-
ses were run for repeated measurements (baseline, 2M and 
6M) of PFN-TOTL and GLM analyses were run by visit (2M 
and 6M) for BSRT-SR and SWMT-OMD. PFN-TOTL data 
were reciprocal transformed for analysis and back-trans-
formed for reporting. Covariate-adjusted analyses included 
the randomization factors. For all outcomes, covariates were 
OSA severity, sex, race, %TSTO2 < 85, age < 60 years, WASI 
verbal IQ and performance IQ. A pre-randomization base-
line was also included as a covariate for BSRT-SR and PFN-
TOTL, and months since randomization was also included for 
PFN-TOTL. Group by OSA severity interactions were includ-
ed, allowing the difference in active vs. sham means to change 
among levels of OSA severity.

2C. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons at Final Analyses after 
Multiple Interim Analyses
For the purpose of adjusting for multiplicity, the tests run 
by primary neurocognitive outcome and visit (2M and 6M) 
without adjustment for covariates were utilized. Adjustments 
for multiple comparisons were limited to the 2M and 6M vis-
its for the three primary neurocognitive outcomes, for those 
analyses without adjustment for covariates and without strati-
fication. These six primary neurocognitive hypothesis tests are 
presented in Table S2 with and without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons at final. O’Brien-Fleming spending across three 
interim analyses left 3.07% Type-I Error for the final analysis.15 
Correction for multiple comparisons at final analyses employed 
sequential Bonferroni adjustment.16
None of the six primary neurocognitive analyses were sig-
nificant after these adjustments were made.
2D. GLM by OSA Severity between 2M and 6M Visits within Arms
GLM analyses were run for SWMT-OMD with covari-
ates to determine whether there was a significant difference 
in the SWMT-OMD at 2M vs. 6M (6M Minus 2M) when 
compared within each OSA severity level and study arm 
(Table S3). In addition to study arm and OSA severity, co-
variates were sex, race, %TSTO2 < 85, age < 60 years, WASI 
Verbal IQ, and WASI Performance IQ. Confidence interval 
lower bounds (CI LB) and upper bounds (UB) are provided 
for each estimated mean.
2E. GLM with %TSTO2 < 85 Quartiles
GLM analyses stratified by quartiles of %TSTO2 < 85, study 
arm, and visit are presented in Table S4 (without adjustment 
for any other covariates). Estimates of the means for the neu-
rocognitive (NC) outcomes are compared between the lower 
three %TSTO2 < 85% quartiles vs. the upper quartile (most hy-
poxic) within visits and study arms. Estimates are least squares 
means.14 Quartiles were estimated by first pooling the data 
across both study arms. Quartile analyses were designed based 
on work by Quan and colleagues.17
The results for the SWMT-OMD are discussed in the main 
text; however, the significant findings for the PFN-TOTL and 
BSRT-SR (shown below) are not described since the primary 
analyses did not show differences between arms across the visits.
2F. Neurocognitive Change Scores for Participants with Baseline 
ESS > 10 or MWT ≤ 14.5
These sub-analyses were conducted to determine the as-
sociation of clinically significant subjective and objective 
sleepiness on our primary outcomes. Two-sample t-tests were 
performed for participants with a baseline Epworth Sleepiness 
Scale-Total Score (ESS-TS) > 10 (subjectively sleepy par-
ticipants; Table S5); this ESS-TS score is indicative of clini-
cally significant sleepiness. Separate analyses were also run 
for participants with a baseline MWT-Mean Sleep Latency 
(MWT-MSL) score ≤ 14.5 (objectively sleepy participants). 
This threshold was selected because it is 1 SD below the 
MWT-MSL for a population of normal individuals tested for a 
20-minute MWT trial duration.18 SWMT-OMD is already for-
mulated as a change-from-baseline score for the 2M and 6M 
visits. For BSRT-DR and PFN-TOTL, change-from-baseline 
scores were calculated for both 2M and 6M (2M Minus DX 
and 6M Minus DX, respectively).
2G. Correlation Coefficients for Participants with Baseline 
MWT ≤ 14.5
Analyses were run for a subgroup of objectively sleepy par-
ticipants. To evaluate the correlation of the change from baseline 
MWT-MSL score and the change from baseline primary neu-
rocognitive score at both 2M and 6M by study arm, Spearman 
correlation coefficients and P values were obtained (Table S6).
SECTION 3. RESULTS – SECONDARY NEUROCOGNITIVE DATA
3A. Selection of 12 Secondary Neurocognitive Outcomes for 
Dimension Reduction
Based on a recommendation by the APPLES Data and Safe-
ty Monitoring Board (DSMB), the APPLES Team utilized an 
independent team of neurocognitive experts to assist them in 
creating an a priori Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis Plan. 
Following multiple conference calls and the dissemination of 
materials related to the APPLES neurocognitive test battery, in-
cluding the psychometric properties (normative data, test-retest 
reliability, and trends including potential practice effects) for 
each outcome, a summary of the literature, and the APPLES 
Methods Paper,7 the team of neurocognitive experts provided 
specific recommendations to the APPLES Team.

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
Twelve variables were identified across the three neu-
rocognitive domains of attention and psychomotor func-
tion (A/P), learning and memory (L/M), and executive and 
frontal-lobe function (E/F): 1) Psychomotor Vigilance Task-
Median Reaction Time (PVT-MDRT); 2) PVT-Mean Slowest 
10% of Reaction Times (PVT-MSRT); 3) PFN-Reaction Time 
(PFN-RTC); 4) CogScreen Symbol Digit Coding-Correct Re-
sponses (SDC-CORR); 5) CogScreen Shifting Attention Task 
Instruction Condition-Thruput (SAT-INPUT); 6) BSRT-Sum-
mary Score (BSRT-MSUM): Mean of BSRT-SR, Long-term 
Storage (LTS), Long-term Retrieval (LTR), and Consistent 
Long-term Retrieval (CLTR); 7) BSRT Delayed Recall-Total 
Recall (BSRTDR-TR); 8) Paced Auditory Serial Addition 
Test-total Correct (PASAT-TC); 9) CogScreen Shifting At-
tention Task Discovery Condition-Rule Shifts Completed 
(SAT-DIRUL); 10) CogScreen Pathfinder Combined-Total 
Time (PFC-TOTL); 11) SWMT-Activation Index: Mid-day 
(SWMT-AMD); and 12) SWMT-Behavioral Index: Mid-day 
(SWMT-BMD) (Table S7).
The plan specified that these 12 variables be shortened to a 
short list of approximately 4-6 variables which best preserve 
the information structure of all 12 using a statistical dimension-
ality reduction method.
3B. Selection of a Statistical Dimension Reduction Method
The APPLES a priori Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis 
Plan specified that the method of Krzanowski19 be used to re-
duce our 12 secondary neurocognitive outcomes to a set of 4 
to 6. Upon beginning that work using the follow-on paper by 
Wang and Gehan20 a subtle, but important math error was de-
tected in the published method. This error was traced back to an 
error made in the first paper in the series.21 The APPLES Data 
Coordinating Center (DCC) was reluctant to use a method that 
was specified incorrectly in the literature and for which no pro-
posed correction has undergone formal peer review.
Based on this finding, Independent Component Analysis 
(ICA) was employed instead of Krzanowski’s method. ICA has 
the “goal of decomposing measured signals or variables into 
a set of underlying variables,”22 which is exactly what was re-
quired per the APPLES Secondary Neurocognitive Analysis 
Plan. The decision to change the method for dimension reduc-
tion was approved by the SC.
We selected those secondary neurocognitive outcomes that 
met the following criterion: If an ICA component was very 
highly correlated with one and only one of the original 12 out-
comes, and had low correlation with all other outcomes, evi-
dence suggested that outcome provided a separable source of 
non-redundant information.
3C. Covariate Adjusted Regression Models for Secondary 
Neurocognitive Outcomes
Covariate adjusted regression models were fit for the 7 sec-
ondary neurocognitive outcomes identified by ICA. GLMM 
were utilized to account for the repeated measures for Cog-
Screen (PFN and SAT-D) and PVT outcomes (DX, 2M, 6M), 
while GLM was run by visit (2M and 6M) for BSRT and 
SWMT outcomes (Table S8). The covariates included in this 
analysis were those designated in the secondary analysis plan 
as being the most likely to explain variation in these outcomes. 
Covariate-adjusted analyses included the randomization fac-
tors. In addition to study arm, covariates were: OSA severity, 
sex, race, %TSTO2 < 85, age < 60 years, WASI Verbal IQ, and 
WASI Performance IQ. A pre-randomization baseline was also

allowing a difference in active vs. sham means for each level of 
OSA severity. SAT-D was formulated as a dichotomized vari-
able (≤ 2 vs. ≥ 3) based on a 5th percentile cut-off for stud-
ies performed for pilots, based on recommendations from 
the developer of this test. PFN and PVT data were reciprocal 
transformed for analysis and back-transformed for reporting. 
Estimates from the models are provided for each study arm,

Adherence
Spearman Correlation Coefficients were obtained to evalu-
ate the correlation of the change in ESS-TS from baseline 
(for 2M and 6M) with CPAP adherence (Table S9). Mean 
hours of adherence for the 2 months prior to the neurocog-
nitive visit was used as the CPAP adherence variable. The 
number of days on the SmartCard was the denominator for 
this variable.

5A. Mean Hours of Nightly Usage – Entire Study Duration
Figure S2 presents the frequency distribution of mean 
hours of nightly CPAP usage per participant by study arm. 
All of the CPAP adherence data for the duration of a patient’s 
follow-up were used to calculate his/her mean. The P val-
ue is for the comparison of distributions between arms via 
a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample test.23 Figure S3 plots 
the 24-hour CPAP usage values by study arm for the entire 
follow-up duration for the 1,098 randomized participants. 
The horizontal axis is a random jitter (i.e., each observation 
was paired with a number from a uniform distribution on 
the interval 0 to 1) of these data. In the active CPAP arm, 
the greatest frequency of usages is between 5 and 7 hours. 
Also notice the higher density of zero and near-zero usage 
for sham. For all adherence analyses presented in this sec-
tion, missing data were assumed to be non-informative. We 
allowed for missingness to be informative in an analysis not

5B. Mean Hours of Nightly Usage – Various Durations Prior to 
the 2M and 6M Visits
Table S10 compares mean hours of nightly CPAP usage be-
tween the study arms for various durations (1 night, 1 week, 1 
month, and 2 months) prior to the 2M- and 6M-CPAP Visits 
using permutation testing. Four different durations were uti-
lized to thoroughly describe CPAP adherence prior to the neu-
rocognitive visits and to select the most informative variable for 
CPAP adherence-adjusted analyses.
Mean hours of adherence were longest for the night prior to a 
neurocognitive visit, decreasing as the duration was lengthened 
to 1 week and 1 month prior to a visit. Mean hours of nightly 
adherence seemed to stabilize over 1 and 2 month durations.
5C. ≥ 4 hours for > 70% of the Time – Various Durations Prior to 
the 2M and 6M Visits
A chi square analysis was run to compare between study 
arms the number of participants with ≥ 4 hours of CPAP use for 
> 70% of the nights for each of the given durations (1 night, 1 
week, 1 month, and 2 months) prior to the 2M- and 6M-CPAP 
Visits (Table S11). The percentages are the number of partici-
pants divided by the sample size for each row.
Four different durations were utilized to thoroughly describe 
CPAP adherence prior to the neurocognitive visits. The number 
of participants who met the adherence criterion was the great-
est for the night prior to a neurocognitive visit, decreasing as 
the duration was lengthened to 1 week, 1 month, and 2 months 
prior to a visit.
5D. Participant Treatment Group Guesses by Arm
Prior to unblinding participants to their assigned treatment 
group condition, participants were asked to guess to which 
study arm they believed they had been assigned (Figure S4). A 
κ coefficient was used to estimate the degree of chance-adjusted 
agreement between participant guesses and arm assignment. A 
total of 69.67% of sham CPAP participants correctly guessed 
their treatment assignment vs. 55.28% of active CPAP partici-
pants (κ = 0.25, P < 0.0001). A κ coefficient of 0.25 is sugges-
tive of relatively poor agreement.24

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
“Each APPLES participant will be followed closely by the 
assigned staff member. All compliance issues will be brought to 
the attention of the CC Coordinator. It may be necessary for the 
CC Coordinator to contact a non-blinded study physician in the 
event of a difficult CPAP compliance problem.”
Despite these efforts, substantial variation in adherence was 
observed in both study arms (Figure S6). Reduction in adher-
ence was most pronounced for participants in the sham arm by 
the 6M visit.
7B. Adherent Subgroup Analysis
Consider a subpopulation restricted to just those “adherent” 
individuals who use their assigned device for at least 4 hours per 
night on average in the two months prior to the visit (2M and 
6M). An analysis comparing baseline variables for the group of 
adherent individuals vs. non-adherent individuals at both the 
2M and 6M time points revealed significant differences in a 
number of baseline variables (Tables S12 and S13). Adherent 
individuals appear to be older on average (2M 4.8 yrs higher, 
P < 0.0001; 6M 5.4 yrs higher, P < 0.0001), are more likely to 
be White (2M/6M P < 0.0001) and married (2M P = 0.0474, 
6M P = 0.0161), and have higher WASI IQ scores on average 
(e.g., IQFull4WASI: 2M 5.1 points higher, P < 0.0001; 6M 4.5 
points higher, P < 0.0001). Some differences in baseline poly-
somnographic variables also emerged. On average, the group of 
CPAP-adherent individuals at 2M and 6M have a lower sleep 
efficiency percentage at baseline (2M 1.9% lower, P = 0.0296; 
6M 3.8% lower, P < 0.0001); and at 6M, adherers had a shorter 
total sleep time (15 minutes lower, P = 0.0011), longer sleep 
latency (4.2 minutes higher, P = 0.0063), longer REM latency 
(5.4 minutes higher, P = 0.0221), and a lower percentage of 
stage 3 sleep (0.67% lower, P = 0.0424).
In the adherent subpopulation, means of the baseline vari-
ables of Table 1 in the manuscript and means of the 1NC out-
comes were compared between the sham and active conditions, 
by post-randomization visit (Table S14). Mean scores are ap-
proximately 2.5 units lower at 6M (P = 0.0453) on the IQ Verbal 
WASI for those on active compared to those on sham.
7C. Dose Response
The APPLES SC wished to know if variation in adherence 
could be responsible for variation in the primary neurocogni-
tive (1NC) outcomes. In particular it was thought that a dose-
response relationship may exist between adherence and 1NC 
outcomes. As demonstrated in section 7b, a potential difficulty 
with such an assessment is that each participant can self-select 
his/her level of adherence. Self-selection opens the possibility 
that participants who adhere more are different on other traits 
from those who adhere less (Table S12). If some of these traits 
drive variation in adherence and in neurocognitive perfor-
mance, then confounding may be present. Namely, a detected 
association between adherence and a 1NC outcome may actu-
ally be due in whole or in part to one or more other factors―
confounders. Unless analysis adjusts for any such confounders 
effectively, then variation in a 1NC outcome could be wrongly 
attributed to variation in CPAP adherence.
7D. Search for Confounders
Various methods have been developed in the statistical 
literature for adherence adjustment in the presence of pos-
sible confounders. Given that CPAP adherence was captured 
on a continuous scale in APPLES, the generalized propensity 
method of Imbens25,26 seems well-suited for this purpose. This 
method allows construction of a dose-response curve between 
adherence to the active condition and a 1NC outcome within 
each study arm while balancing on observed potential baseline 
confounders. Mean response is then compared between study 
arms at points along these curves to assess the effects of sham 
vs. active CPAP as a function of dose because adjustment for

the same set of confounders has been performed in both arms 
and randomization should ensure that treatment assignment is 
independent of a person’s baseline features.
Before proceeding to that modeling exercise, a list of pos-
sible confounders was first identified. APPLES’ investigators 
compiled a comprehensive list of possible confounders that 
were captured in the database (i.e., variables possibly causally 
related to both adherence and 1NC outcome). These 102 vari-
ables are listed in Table S15. Development of this list erred on 
the side of including too many rather than too few candidates 
to avoid missing any true confounders that had been observed.
7E. Adherence Adjustment
The generalized propensity score method was applied, close-
ly following section 7.4 of Hirano and Imbens.26 Estimation 
of generalized propensity scores for adherence to the active 
condition employed the variables of Table S15, was performed 
separately for each visit (2M and 6M), and used the sample 
from the active arm, with variable selection via the lasso and 
coefficient estimation via least squares. The resultant estimated 
dose-response curves are shown in Figure S7.
Difference between active and sham in mean dose-response 
was compared at nine levels of adherence (0, 1,…8 hours), as 
summarized in Table S16. Table S16 reveals a difference in 
means between study arms at the six-month visit for Overall 
Midday at 3 and 4 hours of adherence. The fact that differences 
are detected only at intermediate levels of adherence may be 
in part a statistical artifact, in that error in estimates of a fitted 
mean are wider toward the lower and upper ends of the extent 
of the regressor,31 which here is adherence. Adherence was em-
ployed as a regressor in the second of three stages of the method 
of Hirano and Imbens.26
There is the possibility that the difference detected for 
SWMT Overall Midday was due to sham worsening. Table 
2 in the manuscript provides estimates at 2M for active mean 
[CI] of 0.035 [-0.019 to 0.090] and for sham mean [CI] of 
-0.074 [-0.133 to -0.015]), where the confidence bounds on 
the mean for sham indicate a significant decline from base-
line for sham. Also from Table 2 in the manuscript, estimates 
at 6M for active mean [CI] are 0.072 [0.012 to 0.132] and 
for sham mean [CI] are 0.018 [-0.046 to 0.082]. Adherence 
dropped strongly between 2M and 6M for sham. To enhance

comparability between 2M and 6M, direct standardization32 
was used to provide an overall estimate per arm at 6M wherein 
each of the nine adherence-adjusted means (Table S16) were 
weighted according to the observed (see footnote A follow-
ing appendix) frequency of participants of 0, 1,…8 hours of 
adherence at 2M.
This adjustment at 6M resulted in an estimated active mean 
[CI] of 0.098 [-0.035 to 0.231] and estimated sham mean [CI] 
of -0.002 [-0.010 to0.097]. Direct-standardization -adjusted and 
unadjusted point estimates of the mean for active indicate pos-
sible improvement at 6M from baseline. With direct standard-
ization, the difference between sham and active means is nearly 
two-fold larger than without this standardization; although the 
confidence interval for the direct-standardization estimates of 
means for sham and active each include a mean change score 
of zero. The estimate for the sham mean has become negative, 
which agrees with the finding at 2M for sham worsening. How-
ever, we do not have evidence at 6M for a statistically signifi-
cant decline from baseline, based on confidence intervals, so 
the possibility of sham worsening to completely explain our 
findings remains an open question. The confidence interval on 
the difference in direct-standardization means (active mean – 
sham mean) is [-0.056, 0.256], which includes a difference in 
means of zero.
7F. Future Work
We recognize that the extension of propensity methods to 
non-binary exposure variables has been an active area of re-
search. Further analyses which adjust for adherence could cer-
tainly be conducted on the APPLES data that make use of other 
generalized propensity approaches, such as those of Imai and 
Van Dyk (2004).33 Moreover, combined adjustment for adher-
ence dose-response and retention merits exploration. These top-
ics are being addressed in a separate manuscript in preparation.

A Heckman-type selection model was employed.34 Let Δ be 
change from baseline on the neurocognitive outcome and D be 
the (latent) measure of the tendency to discontinue follow-up. 
Both outcomes are continuous. For person i,
Δi = Xiβ + E1i
Di = Ziγ + E2i
where Xi and Zi are the variables associated with their respec-
tive outcomes, β and γ are vectors of regression coefficients, 
and the {E1i, E2i} follow a bivariate normal distribution of mean 
{0, 0} and correlation parameter ρ. Δi is only observed when 
Di > 0, That is, change scores on neurocognitive outcomes are 
only observed when the tendency to discontinue follow up 
crosses a threshold, typically set arbitrarily to zero as here. De-

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
Committee (SC) identified the following variables for the Xi 
and Zi (Table S17).
Probit modeling was employed because whether or not a per-
son discontinued was observed instead of D (i.e., D is latent). 
Joint estimation of parameters β, γ and ρ was via maximum 
likelihood. For analysis at the two-month visit (2M), a partici-
pant was scored as having discontinued by two months if they 
provided no data on any of the three neurocognitive outcomes 
at 2M or the six-month visit (6M). For analysis at 6M, a partici-
pant was scored as having discontinued by 6M if they provided 
no data on any of the three neurocognitive outcomes at 6M, 
regardless of whether the three neurocognitive outcomes were 
provided at 2M or not. The sample size for each analysis was 
1,098 minus only those cases where a participant was missing 
that particular neurocognitive outcome or one of its covariates 
(i.e., missing data not due to discontinuation from the study). 
These sample sizes were PFN Total 2M at 1,043, PFN Total

of no difference in means between arms.

Figure S7—CPAP adherence-adjusted primary neurocognitive outcomes. Estimates (lines) of mean values for the three primary neurocognitive outcomes 
at 2M and 6M as a function of mean hours of CPAP adherence per night, with generalized propensity score adjustment for candidate confounders. Points 
are observed data with active CPAP (red) and sham CPAP (black); gray vertical bar marks average adherence levels where attained signifi cance levels are 
P < 0.05. Differences detected only at intermediate mean hours of adherence could be due, at least in part, to the fact that confi dence intervals on a regression 
line are wider toward its upper and lower ends.31 Adherence was employed as a regressor in the second of three stages of the method of Hirano and Imbens.26

8B. Assessing Model Assumptions
i. Bivariate normal distribution
Because the bivariate normality assumption is untestable, the 
model of section 1 was run for different transformations (log , 
 and 
3/2 [see footnote B following appendix]) (cf. ref35) of 
the observed change scores . Results are summarized in Table 
S18 for baseline to 2M and baseline to 6M.
Overall, these results in combination with those for the un-
transformed outcome (Table S22) indicate that findings with 
regard to treatment effects are robust to assumptions about the 
shape of the distribution of the change outcome (conditional on 
the Xi). The one possible exception is for PFN Total at 2M. For 
this outcome and visit, a more definitive analysis could explore 
application of methods which explicitly relax assumptions 
about the distributions of E1 and E2 (refs in 36).
ii. Collinearity
Correlations among the variables listed in Table S17 were ex-
amined.31 None were found to be highly correlated with each other, 
with all estimated correlations less than 0.74 (Tables S19 and S20).
iii. Exclusion Restriction
To help distinguish the processes that govern discontinuation 
versus neurocognitive performance, it is desirable to have co-
variates (possible “instruments”) associated with the tendency 
to discontinue follow-up that are not associated with change in 
neurocognitive outcome.37 Table S21 reveals that possible instru-
ments were identified for all models fit except PFN Total at two 
months. Negative coefficients on the indicator variable for active 
arm suggest that sham condition caused dropout. Those partici-
pants with higher quality of life, higher intelligence, older age and 
better oxygen saturation status at baseline were less likely to dis-
continue; and these variables may serve as instruments as well.

Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study—Kushida et al
change from baseline (conditional on the covariates Xi and Zi) 
were statistically significant for Sum Recall, at two months and 
six months, and for Overall Midday at six months. The negative 
sign of the correlation for Sum Recall by two months suggests 
that participants who are doing worse neurocognitively have 
greater tendency to leave during this early phase of follow-up. 
This situation may change during late follow-up. The positive 
signs on correlation coefficients by six months indicate that 
participants who do worse neurocognitively are less likely to 
discontinue by the end of six months of follow-up. The results 
by six months are stronger evidence in two regards. (1) Signifi-
cant correlations were identified for two primary neurocognitive 
outcomes (Sum Recall and Overall Midday) and perhaps a third 
(PFN Total, P = 0.0549) while only one correlation was signifi-
cant by two months (Sum Recall). (2) Estimated correlations are 
larger in absolute value by six months compared to two months.
8D. Conclusions
i.	 Results are generally robust to transformations on the neu-
rocognitive outcome, no evidence of collinearity among 
the covariates of Table S17 were identified, and possible 
instruments were detected for the completion outcome. 
Taken altogether, the assumptions underlying application 
of a Heckman-type selection model appear to have been 
satisfied. One possible exception might be PFN Total at 
2M, for which detection of a treatment effect did vary 
with transformation and for which no possible instruments 
were detected.
ii.	 Different factors (possible instruments) may govern drop-
out (Table S21). Among these, the sham condition appears 
to have been a cause of dropout by six months, as evi-
denced for all three primary outcomes. Differential drop-
out between arms was also identified via life-table and 
competing risks analyses, as reported in the main paper.
iii.	 Completion status appears to be associated with change 
from baseline (  of Table S22) after adjusting for covari-
ates. In particular, evidence from Sum Recall suggests 
those who do worse neurocognitively during the first two 
months are more likely to leave the study early; but, by the 
end of follow-up, evidence from two to perhaps all three 
neurocognitive outcomes suggests those who are doing 
worse neurocognitively are less likely to leave the study. 
Evidence is stronger for the latter finding.
iv.	 Taking these results together, by six months the sham con-
dition appears to cause some amount of discontinuation; 
however, beyond that effect, those who are doing worse 
neurocognitively are less inclined to discontinue.
v.	 When allowance is made for the potentially informative 
dropout via selection modeling, statistical detectabilities of 
treatment effects on primary outcomes remain unchanged 
(
 of Table S22) compared to the results reported in the 
main paper without this adjustment.
SECTION 9. RESULTS – SAFETY
All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Adverse Events 
(AEs) were categorized into one of 17 body systems/event 
categories by the DCC Medical Director. Analyses were per-
formed on all post-randomization SAEs and AEs and tabu-
lated to report incidence proportions. Multiple events for an 
individual subject were recorded and defined as a single On-
Study incidence. All safety analyses used GLM. The Poisson 
distribution was used to model rare events (incidences less

than 10%). For non-rare events, the binomial distribution was 
employed to account for the greater dependence of the vari-
ance on the finite population size. Table S23 provides compari-
sons of incidence proportions between study arms made for all 
SAEs in the Cardiovascular, motor vehicle accident (MVA), or 
Death event categories. These three body system/event catego-
ries were deemed the most import to examine by the APPLES 
Steering Committee and Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB). Table S24 provides comparisons of incidence rates 
between study arms for all safety events (SAE+AE) in all body 
system/event categories.
FOOTNOTE A
We conditioned on the observed frequencies. A more thor-
ough analysis would incorporate the sampling error in the esti-
mated frequencies from the sample at 2M. This would not alter 
conclusions here because reported conditional confidence inter-
vals include zero. 
FOOTNOTE B
The transformations were actually more complicated than 
this. A shift constant was added to each variable to make all 
values positive before logarithmic, square-root or 3/2 power 
transformation.
