Sleep apnea is caused by the collapse of
the upper airway during sleep, which
leads to transientasphyxia.Theseevents
lead to brain arousal, intermittent hy-
poxemia (which induces hypersomno-
lence), poor quality of life, and meta-
bolic disturbances. Cross-sectional and

Context Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line treatment for pa-
tients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, its indication for all
patients with sleep-disordered breathing, regardless of daytime symptoms, is unclear.
Objective To evaluate the effect of CPAP treatment on the incidence of hyperten-
sion or cardiovascular events in a cohort of nonsleepy patients with OSA.
Design, Setting, and Patients Multicenter, parallel-group, randomized con-
trolled trial in 14 teaching hospitals in Spain. Between May 2004 and May 2006, 725
consecutive patients were enrolled who had an apnea-hypopnea index of 20 h−1 or
greater and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 10 or less (scores range from 0-24,
with values 10 suggesting no daytime sleepiness). Exclusion criteria were previous
cardiovascular event, physical or psychological incapacity, chronic disease, or drug or
alcohol addiction. Follow-up ended in May 2009.
Intervention Patients were allocated to receive CPAP treatment or no active inter-
vention. All participants received dietary counseling and sleep hygiene advice.
Main Outcome Measures Incidence of either systemic hypertension (taking an-
tihypertensive medication or blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) or cardio-
vascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, transient ischemic attack,
hospitalization for unstable angina or arrhythmia, heart failure, or cardiovascular death).
Results Seven hundred twenty-three patients underwent follow-up for a median of 4
(interquartile range, 2.7-4.4) years (1 patient from each group did not receive allocated
treatment); 357 in the CPAP group and 366 in the control group were included in the
analysis. In the CPAP group there were 68 patients with new hypertension and 28 car-
diovascular events (17 unstable angina or arrhythmia, 3 nonfatal stroke, 3 heart failure,
2 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 2 transient ischemic attack, 1 cardiovascular death). In
the control group there were 79 patients with new hypertension and 31 cardiovascular
events (11 unstable angina or arrhythmia, 8 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 5 transient
ischemic attack, 5 heart failure, 2 nonfatal stroke). The hypertension or cardiovascular
event incidence density rate was 9.20 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 7.36-11.04) in
the CPAP group and 11.02 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 8.96-13.08) in the control
group. The incidence density ratio was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.63-1.1; P=.20).
Conclusions In patients with OSA without daytime sleepiness, the prescription of
CPAP compared with usual care did not result in a statistically significant reduction in
the incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular events. However, the study may have
had limited power to detect a significant difference.

sion,3,4andOSAhasbeenassociatedwith
cardiovascular diseases,5-7 although this
association is attenuated in some stud-
ies when adjusted for age and obesity.8
Continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) acts as a pneumatic splint to the
upper airway during sleep and corrects
the obstruction, improving daytime
sleepiness and quality of life in patients
withOSA.9Also,CPAPtreatmentcanre-
duce blood pressure in these patients.10
ObservationalstudiessuggestthatCPAP
treatment reduces the incidence of fatal
andnonfatalcardiovasculareventsinpa-
tientswithsevere11 andmoderate12 OSA.
However,noneofthesestudieswereran-
domized. To perform such studies in
symptomatic patients would be unethi-
cal because available evidence of the ef-
fectiveness of CPAP on symptom con-
trol and accident risk precludes the
possibility of withholding treatment in
a long-term study. The indication for
CPAP treatment in nonsleepy patients is
under debate. Two short-term random-
ized controlled trials have shown no ef-
fectofCPAPonbloodpressureandclini-
cal variables in nonsleepy patients with
OSA.13,14 Nonetheless, because of the
high incidence of cardiovascular com-
plicationsinpatientswithOSA,someau-
thors advocate the long-term use of
CPAP treatment for all patients with
sleep-disorderedbreathing,regardlessof
daytime symptoms.15
The primary objective of this study
was to evaluate the effect of CPAP treat-
ment on the incidence of hypertension
or cardiovascular events in a cohort of
nonsleepy patients with OSA. We stud-
ied this composite outcome because hy-
pertension and cardiovascular events
have been associated with OSA, they
sharerelatedpathologicalpathways,and
their clinical relevance has been estab-
lished.16 The secondary objective was to
evaluate the relationship between OSA
severity and the incidence of hyperten-
sion or cardiovascular events.
METHODS
Setting and Participants
Recruitment took place in 14 Spanish
teaching hospitals between May 2004
and May 2006. Follow-up ended in May
2009. Patients were referred to sleep
units for evaluation of observed ap-
neas or snoring. The study was ap-
proved by the ethics committee of each
participating center, and patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
Patients were eligible if they were be-
tween 18 and 70 years old, showed 20
or more apneas plus hypopneas per
hour (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]) in
an overnight sleep study, and had no
daytime hypersomnolence, defined as
an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score
of 10 or lower (ESS scores have a range
of 0-24). The exclusion criteria were
physical or psychological incapacity,
any previous cardiovascular event,
chronic disease, drug or alcohol addic-
tion, chronic intake of hypnotics, or re-
fusal to participate in the study. Pa-
tients with a history of hypertension
were not excluded.
The OSA diagnosis was made using
a conventional polysomnographic or
cardiorespiratory sleep study. The car-
diorespiratory study included, at mini-
mum, continuous recording from na-
sal cannulae, thoracic-abdominal
motion, oxygen saturation, and body
position. Results from all sleep studies
were analyzed by trained personnel at
each participating center, using stan-
dard criteria. An apnea was defined as
an absence of airflow of 10 seconds or
longer and a hypopnea as an airflow re-
duction (50%) lasting 10 seconds or
longer with a greater than 4% de-
crease in oxygen saturation. Obstruc-
tive apneas were defined as the ab-
sence of airflow in the presence of chest
or abdominal wall motion. The AHI was
calculated based on the average num-
ber of apnea plus hypopnea episodes
per hour of sleep or recording time.
Randomization, Blinding,
and Intervention
Eligible patients were randomly as-
signed in a 1:1 ratio to receive CPAP
treatment or no active intervention.
Randomization was performed using a
computer-generated list of random
numbers in the coordinating center and
was stratified by center. The results
were mailed in numbered opaque en-
velopes. The coordinating center saved
a sealed copy of the randomization list
sent to each center. Blood pressures and
all cardiovascular events were as-
sessed objectively by personnel not in-
volved in the study and blinded to pa-
tient allocation. Patients, researchers,
and the statistician were not blinded to
patient allocation.
CPAP titration was performed using
conventional polysomnography or an
autoCPAP device following a vali-
dated protocol.17 CPAP adherence was
measured using the machines’ inter-
nal clocks. All participants received
sleep hygiene advice and dietary coun-
seling for weight loss from the staff of
the sleep units. There was no specific
weight loss program, and patients were
referred to their general practitioner to
monitor weight loss.
Outcomes and Follow-up
The primary outcome was the inci-
dence of either systemic hypertension
(among participants who were normo-
tensive at baseline) or cardiovascular
events (among all participants). The
secondary outcome was the associa-
tion between the incidence of hyper-
tension or cardiovascular events and the
severity of OSA assessed by the AHI and
oxygen saturation.
Informationregardingmedicationuse,
OSA severity, sleepiness (ESS score),
blood pressure, a basic biochemical as-
sessment, and results of electrocardiog-
raphy were recorded for each patient at
inclusion. Cardiovascular events in-
cluded nonfatal myocardial infarction,
nonfatalstroke,transientischemicattack,
hospitalizationforunstableanginaorar-
rhythmia, heart failure, and cardiovas-
cular death. All cardiovascular events
were identified by a cardiologist or neu-
rologist not involved in the study and
blinded to the patients’ randomization
status. Hypertension was defined as tak-
ingantihypertensivemedicationorblood
pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg.
Bloodpressuremeasurementsweretaken
by experienced nurses, following inter-
national guidelines.18
Patients were evaluated at 3, 6, and
12 months and annually thereafter. The

study was designed to follow up pa-
tients for at least 3 years. However, fol-
low-up for the main outcome was
stopped when the patients developed
new-onset hypertension or experi-
enced a cardiovascular event, with-
drew informed consent, were unable to
complete follow-up, or when there was
a change from control group to CPAP
treatment. Exposure time was defined
as the time between randomization and
first cardiovascular event or new-
onset hypertension, date of death, date
of the last study visit, date of with-
drawal, or loss to follow-up.
At each visit a physician recorded car-
diovascular events, blood pressure, ESS
score, weight, CPAP adherence, medi-
cations, alcohol and tobacco consump-
tion,andotherclinicallyrelevantevents.
Sample Size
The sample size was calculated assum-
ingthattheincidenceofhypertensionor
new cardiovascular event in this popu-
lation over a period of 3 years would be
10%annually.Thisestimationwasbased
on published studies19 and data pro-
vided by the Spanish National Epidemi-
ology Center. We estimated that CPAP
would reduce the incidence of new hy-
pertension or cardiovascular events by
60% based on a cohort study by Marin
etal11thatshowedacardiovascularevent
rate of 2.13 per 100 person-years in an
untreated group vs 0.64 per 100 person-
years in a group of patients treated with
CPAP, a 70% relative rate reduction. We
assumed =.05, =.10, 2-sided signifi-
cance testing, and 10% study dropout.
Under these assumptions, the study
would need to enroll a total of 345 pa-
tients per group.
Statistical Analysis
Data were stored in a web-based appli-
cation. R version 2.10.1 was used for
all analyses. Estimated means for treat-
mentadherence,bodymassindex(BMI,
calculated as weight in kilograms di-
vided by height in meters squared), and
ESS scores during the follow-up pe-
riod were computed individually for
each patient as the area under the curve
obtained from the values reported in fol-
low-up visits, taking into account the
time between visits and the last avail-
able information.
Mann-Whitney tests (or t tests if data
were normally distributed) and Pear-
son 2 tests with a Yates continuity cor-
rection (or Fisher exact tests if ex-
pected frequencies were less than 5)
were used for continuous and categori-
cal variables, respectively, when com-
paring the CPAP and control groups.
The effect of the CPAP intervention was
assessed as an incidence density ratio
(IDR) of hypertension or cardiovascu-
lar events, and significance was as-
sessed using the Wald test. A modi-
fied intention-to-treat approach was
used, in which all patients receiving the
allocated intervention were included in
the analysis of the primary outcome.
For modeling incidence, a Poisson re-
gression model was used and adjusted
for intervention group. An additional
analysisincludingrandomhospital(site)
effect was performed because of the hos-
pital imbalances in baseline variables. A
goodness-of-fit test for the assumption
of a Poisson distribution was per-
formed in every adjusted model to de-
termine if a negative binomial model
should be used instead. The use of a Cox
proportional hazards regression model
wasnotpossiblebecausethedatadidnot
satisfytheproportionalhazardsassump-
tion.20 Available information was used
with no need for imputation.
The cumulative incidence, CI(t), of
events at time t was estimated using the
incidence density at that time, ID(t), in
the equation CI(t)=1−exp{−ID(t)*t}.
Therefore, each point of the graph
shows the cumulative incidence after
t years of follow-up in the study, ex-
pressed as a percentage. A post hoc
analysis was performed to assess a pos-
sible dose-response relationship. For
this analysis, the CPAP group was par-
titioned based on whether the mean
CPAP adherence during follow-up was
less than 4 hours.11 The outcomes in
each of these CPAP subgroups were
compared with those in the control
group. The Kruskal-Wallis rank-sum
test was used to analyze the dose-
response relationship as well as differ-
ences between hospitals in quantita-
tive baseline variables.
The secondary outcome of the study
was to assess the association between
the incidence of cardiovascular events
or hypertension and disease severity. To
assess this association, we tested the in-
teraction of severity variables (AHI and
time with arterial oxygen saturation
[SaO2] 90%, dichotomized into 2
groups based on their median values)
with the intervention in a Poisson re-
gression model, with the outcome vari-
able being the incidence of hyperten-
sion or cardiovascular events.
Differences between baseline val-
ues and the mean area under the curve
for BMI and ESS score in follow-up vis-
its were calculated for each patient.
These differences were compared be-
tween intervention groups using the
Mann-Whitney nonparametric test.
RESULTS
A total of 725 patients were random-
ized, with 357 in the CPAP group and
366 in the control group analyzed
(FIGURE 1). Baseline variables were
comparable between the CPAP and con-
trol groups, with the exception of AHI
and time with SaO2 less than 90%. Fifty
percent of the sample was hyperten-
sive at inclusion (TABLE 1). Many of the
baseline variables had site-specific dif-
ferences (eTable 1, available at http:
//www.jama.com).
Follow-up time until a cardiovascu-
lar event, loss to follow-up, or the end
of the study ranged from 0 to 5.38 years,
with a median of 4.0 years (interquar-
tile range [IQR], 2.7-4.4 years). There
were no significant differences in me-
dian follow-up between groups using
the Mann-Whitney test (4.01 years
[IQR, 3.01-4.37] for the CPAP group
vs 3.96 years [IQR, 2.19-4.38] for the
control group; P=.13).

tion, 5 transient ischemic attack, 5 heart

dence density rate for hypertension or
cardiovasculareventsintheCPAPgroup
was 11.02 per 100 person-years and in
the control group was 9.20 per 100 per-
son-years. The IDR was 0.83 (95% CI,
0.63-1.1; P = .20) (TABLE 2 and
FIGURE 2A). Adjustment for random
hospital (site) effect did not substan-
tially modify these results (TABLE 3)
Secondary Outcomes: Relationship
Between Incidence of Events
and OSA Severity
Disease severity was assessed using AHI
and time with SaO2 less than 90%. The
effect of CPAP on the incidence of hy-
pertension or cardiovascular events
with reference to the control group
showed no significant differences across
subgroups of AHI (P=.48) or the per-
centage of time with SaO2 less than 90%
(P=.23). No significant interaction was
found between treatment group and
each of the disease severity variables.
Subgroup Analyses
The mean CPAP adherence ranged from
0 to 8.76 h/night, with a median of 5.00
h/night (IQR, 2.18-6.25). In a post hoc
analysis, we partitioned the patients in
the CPAP group based on a mean ad-
herence of 4 h/night.11 There were 127
patients (36%) with a mean adher-
ence less than 4 h/night (median, 1.00
[IQR, 0.00-2.75]) and 230 with adher-
enceof4h/nightorlonger(median,5.96
[IQR, 5.05-6.70]). There were signifi-
cant differences between these sub-
groups in AHI, time with SaO2 less than
90%, neck circumference, BMI, and hy-
pertension when compared at base-
line (TABLE 4).

is reported in the supplementary on-
line content. When assessed sepa-
rately, CPAP did not show any statis-
tically significant effect on the incidence
of new cardiovascular events (eTable 2,
eTable 3, and eFigure 1) or on new-
onset hypertension (eTable 4, eTable
5, and eFigure 2).
There were 8 deaths in the CPAP
group and 3 in the control group. The
IDR for death was 2.6 (95% CI, 0.70-
11.8; P=.16). Of the patients assigned
to CPAP, 5 died of cancer, 1 of cardio-
vascular causes, 1 of trauma, and an-
other of unknown causes. Among con-
trols, the causes of death were cancer
for 2 and unknown for 1.
Decreases in BMI were significantly
greater in the control group than in the
CPAP group, with a significant differ-
ence of 0.25 (95% CI, 0.04-0.46; P=.02)
(eTable 6). Both groups had changes in
ESS scores, but these changes were sig-
nificantly less in the control group than
in the CPAP group (0.2 vs 1.3;
P.001), with a significant difference
of −1.1 (95% CI, −1.4 to −0.7; P.001)
(eTable 7).
COMMENT
This study suggests that in patients with
OSAandwithoutdaytimesleepiness,the
prescription of CPAP compared with
usual care did not result in a statisti-
cally significant reduction in the inci-
dence of hypertension or cardiovascu-
lar events. However, a larger study or
longer follow-up might have been able
to identify a significant association be-
tween treatment and outcome. A post
hoc analysis suggested that CPAP treat-
ment may reduce the incidence of hy-
pertensionorcardiovasculareventsinpa-
tients with CPAP adherence of 4 h/night
or longer. The disease severity assessed
by the AHI and time with SaO2 less than
90% was not related to the incidence of
hypertension or cardiovascular events.
However, patients with worse oxygen
saturation at night and with CPAP ad-
herence of less than 4 h/night showed a
higher rate of hypertension or cardio-
vascular events than the control group.
Compelling evidence indicates that
severe OSA is associated with an in-
creased incidence of hypertension, car-
diovascular events, or sudden death
during sleep.4,6,7,21 Three systematic re-
views,22-24 4 meta-analyses including 21
randomized controlled trials,10,25-27 and
3 recent studies28-30 have evaluated the
effect of CPAP therapy on blood pres-
sure in patients with OSA. Results
showed significant blood pressure re-
ductions, especially in patients with
more severe OSA.25,26 However, evi-
dence for an effect of CPAP treatment

on cardiovascular events is less defini-
tive. Peker et al31 reported a signifi-
cant increase in the incidence of car-
diovasculardiseaseamongincompletely
treated patients with OSA compared to
those who were efficiently treated. Sev-
eral authors11,12,32,33 have reported an im-
provement in long-term survival asso-
ciated with treatment in different
cohorts of patients with OSA. Marin et
al11 followed up a male cohort of treated
and untreated patients with OSA, snor-
ers, and the general population for 10
years in an observational study. They
showed that CPAP treatment was as-
sociated with a lower risk of fatal and
nonfatal cardiovascular events in pa-
tients with severe OSA when com-
pared with patients who refused CPAP
treatment. The incidence of cardiovas-
cular events in patients receiving CPAP
treatment was not different from that
in the general population or in nonap-
neic snorers. Overall, observational
studies suggest a protective effect of
CPAP treatment on cardiovascular
events in patients with OSA.
In a post hoc analysis in our study,
CPAP was effective in patients who used
the treatment for more than 4 h/night.
Even in these patients, the magnitude
of the effect was less than in previous
observational studies.11 In the study by
Marin et al,11 the group treated with
CPAP had an event rate of 0.64 per 100
person-years, whereas the event rate in
our treatment group was 2.08 per 100
person-years (eTable 2). These results
are not unexpected, because random-
ized trials often show smaller positive
effects than observational studies.
Another possible explanation is that
CPAP is less effective in nonsleepy pa-
tients. Short-term studies focusing on
nonsleepy patients have shown no ef-
fect of CPAP on clinical symptoms or
blood pressure,13,14 and a long-term
study showed a mild beneficial effect
of CPAP on blood pressure only in pa-
tients who used CPAP for 5.6 h/night
or longer.28 In our study, the protec-
tive association of CPAP use with the
incidence of hypertension or cardio-
vascular events in the subgroup of pa-
tients with adherence of 4 h/night or
longer was seen despite that subgroup
being more obese and having a higher
prevalence of hypertension. However,
the results of post hoc analyses should
be interpreted with caution and con-
sidered hypothesis generating. In these
analyses, patients were not random-
ized to the subgroups, and findings may
have resulted from a confounding bias,
such as the healthy-user effect (eg, ad-
herent CPAP users may be more likely
to be adherent with other medica-
tions, treatments, exercise, nutrition, or
other health maintenance).
It has been postulated that non-
sleepy patients treated with CPAP will
probably have poor adherence. Our re-
sults do not support this statement and
show that CPAP treatment is feasible
in this population, even in the ab-
sence of any specific reinforcement. An
unexpected finding was the relatively
high number of deaths during follow-

up. The study sample size was not large
enough to reach a conclusion about any
relationship to treatment, but this is-
sue deserves further research.
The strengths of our study include
its multicentric design and the gener-
alizability of the trial findings. Base-
line cardiovascular risk factors were not
different between groups, and median
follow-up time was similar. Neverthe-
less, this study has several potential
limitations.
First, the lack of effect of CPAP
on hypertension or cardiovascular
events could be related to an inad-
equately powered estimation of the
sample size. The lack of previous
studies suitable for sample size calcu-
lation contributed to the difficulty of
sample size estimation. The potential
protective effect of CPAP was prob-
ably overestimated, and a larger
study or longer follow-up might have
been able to identify a significant
association between treatment and
outcome. Including patients with
hypertension also might have con-
tributed to a lack of study power,
because these patients could not
develop 1 component of the com-
bined primary end point, incident
hypertension. Incident hypertension
accounted for more than two-thirds
of the primary end point events.
Second, medical research personnel
were not blinded to patient alloca-
tion. However, cardiovascular events
and blood pressure were assessed
objectively, by personnel not in-
volved in the study and blinded to
patient allocation.
Third, at baseline the CPAP group
had higher AHI scores and slightly
greater time with SaO2 less than 90%.
These differences, although statisti-
cally significant, were likely to be of
little clinical relevance, because both
groups had severe OSA, and all other
characteristics and cardiovascular risk
factors were similar between the groups
at baseline. Fourth, blood pressure val-
ues were measured at clinic visits, an
approach that can be affected by the
white coat effect, observer bias, lim-
ited reproducibility, and the intrinsic
inaccuracy of the examiner’s ausculta-
tion technique. However, measure-
ments were taken by experienced
nurses following international guide-
lines. Fifth, one possible explanation for
the smaller effect size of CPAP in this
trial compared with prior studies is that
the titration protocols may have been
less effective, resulting in an elevated
residual AHI on CPAP treatment. Al-
though we do not know if this oc-
curred, our CPAP titration protocol has
been validated in previous studies per-
formed by our research group.17
In conclusion, in this study of pa-
tients with OSA without daytime sleepi-
ness, the prescription of CPAP com-
pared with usual care did not result in
a statistically significant reduction in the
incidence of hypertension or cardio-
vascular events. However, the study
may have had limited power to detect
a significant difference. A post hoc
analysis suggested that CPAP treat-
ment may reduce the incidence of hy-
pertension or cardiovascular events in
patients with CPAP adherence of 4
h/night or longer.
