background
The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Patients with Central Sleep
Apnea and Heart Failure trial tested the hypothesis that continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) would improve the survival rate without heart transplantation of pa-
tients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.
methods
After medical therapy was optimized, 258 patients who had heart failure (mean age
[±SD], 63±10 years; ejection fraction, 24.5±7.7 percent) and central sleep apnea (num-
ber of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep, 40±16) were randomly as-
signed to receive CPAP (128 patients) or no CPAP (130 patients) and were followed
for a mean of two years. During follow-up, sleep studies were conducted and measure-
ments of the ejection fraction, exercise capacity, quality of life, and neurohormones
were obtained.
results
Three months after undergoing randomization, the CPAP group, as compared with the
control group, had greater reductions in the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypo-
pnea (¡21±16 vs. –2±18 per hour, P<0.001) and in norepinephrine levels (¡1.03±1.84
vs. 0.02±0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009), and greater increases in the mean nocturnal
oxygen saturation (1.6±2.8 percent vs. 0.4±2.5 percent, P<0.001), ejection fraction
(2.2±5.4 percent vs. 0.4±5.3 percent, P=0.02), and the distance walked in six minutes
(20.0±55 vs. ¡0.8±64.8 m, P=0.016). There were no differences between the control
group and the CPAP group in the number of hospitalizations, quality of life, or atrial
natriuretic peptide levels. An early divergence in survival rates without heart transplan-
tation favored the control group, but after 18 months the divergence favored the CPAP
group, yet the overall event rates (death and heart transplantation) did not differ (32 vs.
32 events, respectively; P=0.54).
conclusions
Although CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea, improved nocturnal oxygenation, in-
creased the ejection fraction, lowered norepinephrine levels, and increased the distance
walked in six minutes, it did not affect survival. Our data do not support the use of
CPAP to extend life in patients who have central sleep apnea and heart failure.

entral sleep apnea, which is pres-
ent in approximately 25 to 40 percent of pa-
tients with chronic heart failure,1-3 results
from cyclic hyperventilation and falls in the partial
pressure of arterial carbon dioxide below the apnea
threshold.4 The condition affects cardiovascular
function adversely by causing tissue hypoxia, arous-
als from sleep, and activation of the sympathetic
nervous system, and it independently increases the
risk of death.1,5,6
In short-term, single-center randomized trials
lasting one to three months involving small num-
bers of patients who had central sleep apnea and
chronic heart failure, continuous positive airway
pressure (CPAP) attenuated the central sleep apnea,
increased the left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF), reduced daytime levels of atrial natriuretic
peptide and plasma norepinephrine, and improved
the patients’ quality of life.4,7,8 In one trial, among
patients receiving CPAP, there was a trend toward
fewer deaths and heart transplantations.5 However,
that trial involved only 29 patients and was con-
ducted before there was wide use of beta-blockers
to treat heart failure.
We therefore undertook a multicenter trial to
test the hypothesis that long-term treatment of cen-
tral sleep apnea with the use of CPAP in patients
who have heart failure and are receiving optimal
medical therapy reduces the combined rates of
death and heart transplantation.9 During the trial,
we also evaluated the effect of CPAP on the LVEF,
quality of life, submaximal exercise, number of
hospitalizations, and levels of plasma norepineph-
rine and atrial natriuretic peptide.
study design
The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure
for Patients with Central Sleep Apnea and Heart
Failure (CANPAP) trial was a randomized, open-
label trial in which outcomes were evaluated at 11
centers9 by investigators blinded to the treatment
assignments. It was supported by a grant from the
Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Uni-
versity Industry Program (UI-14909) in partnership
with Respironics, ResMed, and Tyco Healthcare.
The sponsors had no role in the conception or de-
sign of the study; the collection, analysis, or inter-
pretation of the data; or the drafting or revision of
the manuscript. The research ethics board of each
institution approved the protocol.8 Enrollment oc-
curred after patients provided written informed
consent.
patients
Candidates for participation in the trial included
men and women 18 to 79 years of age who had
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional
class II through IV heart failure due to ischemic,
hypertensive, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopa-
thy and whose condition had been stabilized by
means of optimal medical therapy for at least one
month; an LVEF of less than 40 percent on radio-
nuclide angiography; and central sleep apnea, de-
fined as 15 or more episodes of apnea and hypo-
pnea per hour of sleep, more than 50 percent of
which were determined to be central rather than
obstructive. The exclusion criteria were pregnan-
cy, myocardial infarction, unstable angina or car-
diac surgery within the previous three months,
and obstructive sleep apnea.
baseline assessment
Eligible patients underwent clinical assessment fol-
lowed by overnight polysomnography. Sleep stages
and arousals, episodes of apnea and hypopnea, and
the mean and lowest arterial oxygen saturation lev-
els were assessed according to uniform methods at
all centers.4,10,11 Respiratory efforts were measured
with the use of respiratory inductance plethysmog-
raphy, and airflow by nasal pressure.2,3,6,12-15 Cen-
tral sleep apnea was defined as the absence of tidal
volume for 10 or more seconds without thoraco-
abdominal motion,3,4 and central hypopnea as a re-
duction of 50 percent or more in tidal volume from
baseline for 10 or more seconds without airflow
limitation, as detected with the measurement of
nasal pressure.4,12 Apnea and hypopnea were classi-
fied as obstructive if there was out-of-phase motion
of the rib cage and abdomen, or if airflow limita-
tion was present.3,12 The apnea–hypopnea index
was defined as the number of episodes of apnea and
hypopnea per hour of sleep. The diagnosis of cen-
tral sleep apnea required an apnea–hypopnea index
of 15 or more events per hour, with more than 50
percent of the events determined to be central rather
than obstructive .2,3

according to a seven-point scale, with lower scores
indicating worse condition)4,17 were then deter-
mined. At three centers, the levels of atrial natri-
uretic peptide and plasma norepinephrine were
measured between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.
randomization
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to the
control group, who continued to receive optimal
medical therapy for chronic heart failure,18 or to
the treatment group, who received CPAP in addi-
tion to the medical therapy. Randomization was
performed by a computer-generated schedule in
random blocks of four and six and was stratified
according to study center and brand of CPAP de-
vice. Treatment assignment was communicated to
the study centers by the data management center
after verification that the patient met all the eligibil-
ity criteria. Patients assigned to CPAP underwent
further randomization in a 2:1:1 ratio to one of the
devices (Respironics Remstar Pro, ResMed Sulli-
van VII, or Tyco Healthcare GoodKnight 420S, re-
spectively). The use of CPAP devices from three
different companies was a consequence of the ar-
rangements made for study funding.
initiation of cpap
CPAP was initiated over two to three nights, which
the patients spent in an unmonitored sleep labora-
tory or a hospital bed,4,7,8 starting at a pressure
of 5 cm of water the first night, then increasing by
2 to 3 cm of water over the next one or two nights
until reaching a pressure of 10 cm of water (a level
shown to attenuate central sleep apnea)4,5,7 or the
highest pressure tolerated. Patients were instruct-
ed to use CPAP for at least six hours nightly at home
during the trial. If necessary, the pressure was raised
to 10 cm of water or the highest level tolerated at
the follow-up visits at the end of month 1 or month
3. At each follow-up visit, the number of hours dur-
ing which CPAP was used was downloaded from a
meter that measured the amount of time the mask
was used.
assessment of outcomes
Clinical assessments were performed at one, three,
and six months after randomization, and every six
months thereafter. Polysomnography was per-
formed at 3 and 24 months. LVEF, the distance
walked in six minutes, and quality of life were as-
sessed at 3, 6, and 24 months. At three centers,
levels of plasma norepinephrine and atrial natri-
uretic peptide were obtained at 3, 6, and 24 months.
Patients were followed from randomization until
death, heart transplantation, or the end of the study.
The time and cause of death or time of heart trans-
plantation were ascertained from medical records
or death certificates and were verified by an end-
point adjudication committee.
To confirm previous evidence that CPAP attenu-
ates central sleep apnea and improves cardiovascu-
lar function after three months, we calculated the
changes from baseline in the apnea–hypopnea in-
dex, mean and minimum nocturnal oxygen satura-
tion, LVEF, and levels of plasma norepinephrine
and atrial natriuretic peptide at three months and
throughout the remainder of the trial.4,7,8 The pri-
mary outcome was the combined rate of death from
all causes and heart transplantation (the data were
censored as of the date of transplantation). Sec-
ondary outcomes included death alone and trans-
plantation-free survival, with censoring of data on
patients who dropped out, the number of hospital
admissions confirmed on the basis of medical rec-
ords, and changes from baseline in the distance
walked in six minutes and in the quality of life.
sample size
The size of the sample for the primary outcome
was calculated with the use of the log-rank test, as-
suming an annual event rate of 24 percent in the
control group,5,6,9,15 with a relative hazard ratio
for CPAP of 0.65. At a two-sided alpha level of 0.05,
with 80 percent power, we estimated that 204 pa-
tients per group would be required.19
statistical analysis
Kaplan–Meier estimates were used to visualize
survival without heart transplantation. Cox pro-
portional-hazards analysis was used to compare
transplantation-free survival between groups. The
primary statistical analysis was according to the
intention-to-treat principle. A secondary analysis
of this outcome, with data on those who dropped
out censored as of the dropout date, was also per-
formed. Generalized linear models for binomial
and Poisson distributed outcomes were used to as-
sess changes in the overall event rate over time.20
Further analyses with the use of Cox propor-
tional-hazards models examined the effects of in-
teractions between the treatment assignment and
compliance with the treatment, age, NYHA class,
LVEF, cause of heart failure, medications, and body-
mass index on the primary outcome. The number

of hospital admissions in the two groups were
compared with the use of the Wilcoxon rank-sum
test. For the analysis of repeated measurements of
the secondary outcomes collected over time, we
used a model of longitudinal data, and the mea-
surements were compared between groups with the
use of linear mixed-effects models, wherein we ex-
amined interactions between time and treatment
over the duration of the trial. We also analyzed sec-
ondary outcomes a priori after three months, which
was the point in the study for which we had the
most complete follow-up data. All data analyses
were performed with S-Plus 6.2 software (Insight-
ful). All P values are two-sided. Continuous data
are expressed as means ±SD, unless otherwise in-
dicated.
After the first 200 patients had been followed
for a minimum of six months, the data and safety
monitoring committee performed a prespecified
interim analysis. It recommended termination of
the study because of an early divergence of the
transplantation-free survival curves favoring the
control group, enrollment at only 50 percent of
the predicted rate, and a falling rate of death and
heart transplantation that precluded the ability to
detect a difference in the primary outcome between
the two groups with the originally predicted sam-
ple size. On the basis of this recommendation,
the executive committee stopped the trial on May
21, 2004.
patients
Of 727 patients who were screened between De-
cember 1998 and May 2004, 345 met the eligibility
criteria, of whom 258 agreed to participate and
underwent randomization: 130 patients were as-
signed to the control group and 128 to the CPAP
group. Table 1 shows the similarity in baseline
characteristics of the two groups. Ninety-six per-
cent of the patients were men, consistent with the
epidemiology of heart failure in patients of a similar
age21 and with the predominance of men among
those with heart failure who have central sleep ap-
nea.3,4,6,15,22,23
The mean apnea–hypopnea index of 40 per hour
indicates severe central sleep apnea. Although
some misclassification of hypopnea is possible, the
overwhelming predominance of episodes of cen-
tral apnea and hypopnea makes overlap with main-
ly obstructive sleep apnea unlikely (Table 1).

cpap for central sleep apnea and heart failure
2029
compliance and dropout rate
During the course of the trial, 20 patients in each
group (15.5 percent) dropped out, refusing further
evaluation. In the CPAP group, the average number
of hours of daily use of CPAP varied between 4.3
hours during the first three months to 3.6 hours at
one year and beyond. The CPAP averaged 8 to 9 cm
of water at three months and beyond.
effect of cpap on central sleep apnea 
and cardiovascular function
At three months, the patients assigned to CPAP
had a greater (50 percent) reduction in the apnea–
hypopnea index than those in the control group
(¡21±16 vs. ¡2±18 per hr, P<0.001) (Fig. 1) and
greater increases in mean oxygen saturation
(1.6±2.8 percent vs. 0.4±2.5 percent, P<0.001) and
minimum oxygen saturation (4.7±7.3 percent vs.
0.9±6.0 percent, P<0.001) (Fig. 1). These changes
were sustained throughout the trial. There were no
changes in sleep time, distribution of sleep stages,
or frequency of arousal in either group (P>0.19 for
each variable). At three months, CPAP caused a
greater increase in LVEF (2.2±5.4 percent vs.
0.4±5.3 percent, P=0.02) (Fig. 1) and a greater
reduction in levels of plasma norepinephrine
(¡1.03±1.84 vs. 0.02±0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009)
than did no intervention. These benefits were sus-
tained for up to two years. CPAP had no significant
effect on levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (P=0.64).
primary outcome
Collection of follow-up data on patients for the pri-
mary end point stopped on May 21, 2004, when the
trial was terminated by the executive committee.
Primary outcome data were obtained for all pa-
tients, including dropouts. The mean follow-up in-
terval was 2 years (range, 0 to 64 months). The rate
of the primary event decreased from 20 to 4 per
100 person-years between 1998–1999 and 2004
(P=0.003) (Fig. 2). This falling event rate was asso-
ciated with a changing pattern of drug therapy.

Saturation, and Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.
CPAP resulted in significant long-term reductions in the number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep 
(Panel A) and increases in the mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (Panel B), the LVEF (Panel C), and the minimum noc-
turnal oxygen saturation (Panel D). P values represent time–treatment interactions over the period of the entire trial

During the same period, more patients were receiv-
ing beta-blockers (a change from 58 percent to 86
percent, P<0.001) and spironolactone (a change
from 14 percent to 41 percent, P=0.001) and fewer
patients were receiving digoxin (a change from 72
percent to 36 percent, P=0.002) at the time of en-
rollment. The use of beta-blockers and spironolac-
tone also increased between the time of baseline
assessment and the time of the last follow-up visit
for the two groups (beta-blockers, from 77 percent
to 83 percent, P<0.001; and spironolactone, from
34 percent to 51 percent, P=0.04), but between the
groups, the changes did not differ significantly
(P>0.18 for each drug).
During follow-up, there were 28 deaths and
four heart transplantations in the control group
and 27 deaths and five heart transplantations in the
CPAP group. Most of the deaths were due to cardio-
vascular causes (Table 2). In the proportional-haz-
ards model, there was no difference in transplanta-
tion-free survival between the control group and
the CPAP group (hazard ratio for heart transplanta-
tion, 1.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.71 to
1.90; P=0.54) (Fig. 3). However, the hazards ap-
peared to be nonproportional during the follow-up
period (chi-square=10.9, P=0.001). There was a
divergence of event rates in the first 18 months fa-
voring the control group (hazard ratio for an event,
1.5; P=0.02) that was reversed after 18 months to
favor CPAP (hazard ratio for an event, 0.66; P=0.06).
The level of CPAP and the hours of use were not re-
lated to the rate of the primary event. There was no
significant interaction between treatment assign-
ment and the seven variables included in the statis-
tical analysis. A post hoc analysis did not detect any
significant difference in the primary event rate
among the three CPAP devices (P=0.31).
secondary outcomes
Death rates alone did not differ significantly be-
tween the two groups of patients (hazard ratio for
death, 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to
1.88; P=0.714). With the use of a time-dependent
covariate to indicate dropout, the analysis of survival
among the patients who did drop out was found
to be worse than among those who did not (haz-
ard ratio for death, 3.8; P<0.001), with 10 events
among the 20 dropouts from the CPAP group and
9 events among the 20 dropouts from the control
group. Neither overall transplantation-free survival
(hazard ratio for death, 1.04; 95 percent confidence
interval, 0.78 to 1.4; P=0.778) nor survival dur-
ing the first 18 months (hazard ratio for death, 1.4;
P=0.10) differed significantly between patients in
the control group and those in the CPAP group who
remained in the trial.
The number of hospitalizations did not differ
significantly between the control group and the
CPAP group (hospitalizations per patient per year,
0.56±0.56 vs. 0.61±0.72; P=0.45). The distance

cpap for central sleep apnea and heart failure
2031
walked in six minutes increased more in the CPAP
group than in the control group at three months
(20.0±55 vs. ¡0.8±64.8 m, P=0.016), but not over
the whole study period; the average difference was
11.1 m (95 percent confidence interval, ¡5.3 to
27.5), favoring the CPAP group (P=0.18). Changes
in patients’ scores on the Chronic Heart Failure
Questionnaire did not differ significantly between
the two groups.
The CANPAP trial tested the effects of CPAP on
morbidity and mortality among patients with cen-
tral sleep apnea and chronic heart failure. The trial
addressed two important issues: First, it confirmed
the findings of previous small, short-term trials
that CPAP attenuates central sleep apnea, improves
nocturnal oxygenation and left ventricular systolic
function, and lowers plasma norepinephrine lev-
els,4,5,7 and it showed that these effects are sus-
tained with long-term therapy. Second, the trial
failed to demonstrate any beneficial influence of
CPAP on transplantation-free survival, number of
hospitalizations, or quality of life. Therefore, al-
though CPAP improved several physiological out-
comes, this improvement did not translate into
longer transplantation-free survival. CPAP did re-
sult in an increase of 20 m in the distance walked in
six minutes during the first three months of fol-
low-up, but this improvement was not sustained.
CPAP has been shown to improve cardiovascu-
lar function in patients with heart failure who have
central sleep apnea only when the treatment reduc-
es the apnea–hypopnea index.4,5,7,8,22 Because
CPAP does not attenuate central sleep apnea in pa-
tients with heart failure when the treatment is ti-
trated over one night,22-24 we mandated a gradual
upward-titration protocol.4,7,8 This resulted in a
significant reduction in the apnea–hypopnea index,
which was accompanied by an increase in noctur-
nal oxygen saturation that persisted for at least two
years. Nonetheless, the reduction of 50 percent in
the apnea–hypopnea index was less than had been
achieved in previous trials with the use of similar
upward titration and CPAP pressures,4 factors that
may have contributed to the lack of a beneficial ef-
fect on clinical outcomes.
Improvement in daytime LVEF may be due to
several factors, including a reduction in cardiac
sympathetic drive,7,25,26 left ventricular unloading
resulting from an increase in intrathoracic pres-
sure,27 and reduced myocardial ischemia due to
improvement in oxygen saturation.28,29 However,
the increase of 2.2 percent in the LVEF was less
than the increase of 7.7 percent observed in our first
randomized trial.4 We attribute this difference to
the higher initial LVEF (24.5 percent vs. 20.0 per-
cent) and the greater proportion of patients receiv-
ing beta-blockers in the present trial (77 percent vs.
<20 percent). Owing to the overlap in the effects of
beta-blockade and CPAP on ventricular function,30
the potential for further improvement in the LVEF
when CPAP is added may be limited. The high rate
of use of beta-blockers may also have reduced the
potential for a beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.
The early divergence of event rates that initially
favored the control group but favored the CPAP
group after 18 months was not anticipated (Fig. 3).
It suggests that CPAP had an early adverse effect in
some patients. Two possible reasons may be the
effect of the dropouts and improvements in back-
ground medical therapy. The early difference in
transplantation-free survival between the control
group and the CPAP group is diminished if it is cal-
culated by excluding the patients who dropped out
(among whom event rates were higher than among
those who did not drop out). Background medical
therapy is of importance, because the acute effect
of CPAP in heart failure is a function of left ventric-
discussion
Figure 3. Heart-Transplantation–free Survival.
There was no difference in transplantation-free survival rates between the 
control group and the CPAP group (hazard ratio for transplantation-free sur-
vival, 1.16; P=0.54). However, there was an early divergence in the event rates 
that favored the control group (hazard ratio for transplantation-free survival, 
1.5; P=0.02) that altered after 18 months to favor the CPAP group (hazard ra-
tio for transplantation-free survival, 0.66; P=0.06).

ular preload: when filling pressures are high, the
cardiac output increases, and when pressures are
low, it decreases.31 We cannot exclude the possibil-
ity that upward titration of CPAP reduced cardiac
output in some patients with low filling pressures,
owing to more vigorous diuresis or other medical
interventions. If so, a slower CPAP titration might
have avoided some adverse events.
In summary, CPAP attenuated central sleep ap-
nea and improved nocturnal oxygenation, left ven-
tricular function, sympathetic nervous activity, and
(at least initially) submaximal exercise perfor-
mance. However, the CANPAP trial did not demon-
strate a beneficial effect of CPAP on morbidity or
mortality in these patients with central sleep apnea
and heart failure. Because of a declining primary
event rate, which was possibly due in part to con-
current improvements in drug therapy,32,33 it
would have required a trial three times the size of
ours to determine whether the physiological im-
provements observed were surrogates for clinically
important outcomes.19 Although the CANPAP trial
ultimately lacked the power to conclude with cer-
tainty that CPAP is ineffective in this patient popu-
lation, our data do not support its routine use to
extend life in patients with central sleep apnea and
heart failure. However, this recommendation may
not be applicable to patients with heart failure who
have obstructive sleep apnea, the pathophysiology
of which, arising from pharyngeal occlusion, dif-
fers from that of central sleep apnea.1-3,34-38

clinical trial registration
The Journal encourages investigators to register their clinical trials in a public trials 
registry. The members of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
plan to consider clinical trials for publication only if they have been registered 
(see N Engl J Med 2004;351:1250-1). The National Library of Medicine’s 
www.clinicaltrials.gov is a free registry, open to all investigators, that meets 
the committee’s requirements.
