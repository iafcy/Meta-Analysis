Clinical comparisons between devices driven by different algorithms are needed.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We compared the clinical effectiveness of fixed pressure CPAP and four different autoCPAP devices by assessing compliance and QOL (36-item short-form health survey [SF-36]). SAHS patients were randomly allocated to five groups. Polysomnography (PSG) was performed to titrate the effective pressure in the constant CPAP group and evaluate residual apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) under autoCPAP. Follow-up consisted of clinical visits at three and six months by homecare technicians who assessed compliance, symptom scores and SF-36 scores. A laboratory-based PSG using the same CPAP/autoCPAP device as at home was performed at six months.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Eighty-three patients (mean age 56+/-10 yrs) with mean body mass index (BMI) 30.8+/-5.3 kg/m(2) and severe SAHS (mean AHI: 52.3+/-17.8/h) were included. There were no differences in clinical symptoms or QOL scores, and similar clinical and PSG improvements were seen in all groups. CPAP use was >5 h per night, without any significant difference between groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      AutoCPAP is equally as effective as fixed CPAP for long-term home treatment in severe SAHS patients."

            "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that upper airway (UA) sensory receptors play a role in the maintenance of UA patency and contribute to arousal in response to airway occlusion. An impairment of UA sensory function could therefore predispose to UA obstruction during sleep. We hypothesized that UA sensation is impaired in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and that sensation improves after treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We measured two-point discrimination (2PD) and vibratory sensation thresholds (VT) in 37 patients with OSA (mean [+/- SE] apnea- hypopnea index [AHI] = 39 +/- 5 events/h), 12 nonapneic snorers (SN), and 15 control subjects (CL). Sensory thresholds were determined in the UA and on the lip and hand as control sites. Both 2PD and VT were similar among the three groups at the lip and hand sites but were significantly reduced in the UA of OSA and SN subjects versus CL (p < 0.05). Values for 2PD and VT in the UA of OSA versus SN were not significantly different. Sensory measures were repeated after 6 mo in 23 OSA patients treated with CPAP as well as in 18 untreated patients. Thresholds for 2PD and VT at control sites remained identical in both groups, as did 2PD for the UA. However, VT in the UA showed a significant improvement in treated (4.4 +/- 0.2 pre-CPAP versus 3.8 +/- 0.2 mm post-CPAP, p < 0.05) but not untreated patients. These findings indicate the presence of a selective impairment in the detection of mechanical stimuli in the UA of patients with OSA and SN, which is partially reversible after treatment with nasal CPAP in patients with OSA."

            "abstract": "The role of the arterial baroreflex in the cardiovascular changes associated with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and the effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on baroreflex function during sleep are unknown. Baroreflex control of heart rate was studied in 29 normotensive patients with OSAS under no treatment, in 11 age-matched control subjects, and in 10 patients at CPAP withdrawal after 5.5 +/- 3.7 (range 3-14) months of treatment. Baroreflex control of heart rate was assessed by \"sequence method\" analysis of continuous blood pressure recordings (Finapres) obtained during nocturnal polysomnography. In untreated OSAS, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was low during wakefulness and non-rapid eye movement (REM) stage 2 sleep compared with control subjects, and correlated inversely with mean lowest Sa(O(2)) and the blood pressure increase after apneas. After CPAP treatment, the apnea-hypopnea index was lower, and mean lowest Sa(O(2)) higher than before treatment. After CPAP, patients were more bradycardic, blood pressure and its standard deviation decreased as Sa(O(2)) improved in non-REM stage 2 sleep, and BRS increased (nocturnal wakefulness: +59%; non-REM stage 2 sleep: +68% over pretreatment values). Our data suggest that baroreflex dysfunction in OSAS may be at least partly accounted for by nocturnal intermittent hypoxemia, and can be reversed by long-term CPAP treatment."

The aim of the European Respiratory Society Task Force was to review the evidence in favour of MAD therapy. Effects of tongue-retaining devices are not included in this report. Custom-made MADs reduce apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) and daytime sleepiness compared with placebo devices. CPAP more effectively diminishes AHI, while increasing data suggest fairly similar outcomes in relation to symptoms and cardiovascular health from these treatments. Patients often prefer MADs to CPAP. Milder cases and patients with a proven increase in upper airway size as a result of mandibular advancement are most likely to experience treatment success with MADs. A custom-made device titrated from an initial 50% of maximum mandibular advancement has been recommended. More research is needed to define the patients who will benefit from MAD treatment compared with CPAP, in terms of the effects on sleep-disordered breathing and on other diseases related to OSA. In conclusion, MADs are recommended for patients with mild to moderate OSA (Recommendation Level A) and for those who do not tolerate CPAP. The treatment must be followed up and the device adjusted or exchanged in relation to the outcome."

In 2003, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recognized sleep apnea as a common and identifiable cause of hypertension and suggested blood pressure screening among patients with OSA. OSA increases both daytime and nocturnal ambulatory blood pressures through the activation of various neurohumoral factors including the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to reduce BP among persons with OSA. The benefits of OSA treatment are related to implications for hypertension management."

Exclusion criteria were the presence of structural heart disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidaemia, alcoholism, neuromuscular disease, renal failure, or malignancy. They were not previously considered or treated for OSA and were all free of drugs. Left ventricular lateral and septal wall early myocardial peak velocity (Em), late myocardial peak velocity (Am), Em to Am ratio, myocardial relaxation time (RTm), myocardial systolic wave (Sm) velocity, isovolumic acceleration (IVA), myocardial pre-contraction time (PCTm), contraction time (CTm), and PCTm to CTm ratio were measured. All echocardiographic parameters were calculated 6 months after CPAP therapy. No statistically significant difference was detected between the groups according to age, gender, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, fasting blood glucose, and serum lipid parameters. Left ventricular systolic parameters, such as LV septal and lateral wall IVA, CTm, and PCTm to CTm ratio, were significantly lower and Sm was similar in patients with the OSAS group compared with the controls. Left ventricular diastolic parameters, such as LV septal and lateral wall Em velocity and Em to Am ratio, were significantly lower; RTm was significantly prolonged; and Am velocity was similar in patients with OSAS compared with the controls. At the end of the treatment, 20 of 28 patients were compliant with CPAP therapy. Left ventricular septal and lateral wall Em velocity, Em to Am ratio, IVA and CTm, and PCTm to CTm increased significantly, PCTm, PCTm to CTm ratio, and RTm decreased significantly after the therapy, whereas Sm velocity and Am velocity did not change after CPAP therapy in compliant patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunctions were determined in patients with OSAS, and it was demonstrated that LV systolic and diastolic dysfunctions improved with 6 month CPAP therapy."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is increasingly considered as a risk factor for metabolic disturbances, such as diabetes mellitus or dyslipidaemia. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, the standard treatment for patients with OSA, may improve various metabolic variables, such as insulin sensitivity, glucose metabolism, lipids, fat distribution and adipokines. Several observational and uncontrolled clinical studies claim an improvement of these metabolic variables through the use of CPAP. However, there is only a limited number of clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of CPAP on metabolic variables. In this review, we summarise and discuss non-randomised studies and RCTs evaluating the effect of CPAP on metabolic variables in patients with OSA. In summary, the currently available body of evidence does not support a clinically important effect of CPAP treatment on any of the investigated metabolic variables. However, some investigators found small, but statistically significant changes in some metabolic variables, thus beneficial effects of CPAP treatment in selected patient cohorts cannot be excluded. To answer this question, more data from RCTs with well-defined study populations are warranted."

            "abstract": "The relationships between obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and stroke are still under discussion, but increasing evidence demonstrates that the OSAS is an independent risk factor for stroke. However, in rare cases, OSAS could be a consequence of strokes, especially if located in the brainstem. Many recent studies have found a 70 to 95% frequency of OSAS (defined by an apnoea/hypopnoea index >10) in patients with acute stroke. Age, body mass index, diabetes, and severity of stroke have been identified as independent predictors of stroke. Furthermore, the presence of OSAS in stroke patients could lead to a poor outcome. The potential mechanisms linking OSAS and stroke are probably multiple (arterial hypertension, cardiac arrhythmia, increased atherogenesis, coagulation disorders, and cerebral haemodynamic changes). Despite numerous uncertainties, OSAS should be systematically screened at the moment it is clinically suspected in patients with acute stroke. However, the optimal timing (early or differed) for treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure remains to be determined."

In group I, the positive pressure (PP) level was set to suppress flow limitation (PFL), while in group II the PP was set at a level that eliminated only apnoea/hypopnoea and snoring (PAHS). At the end of a 3 week period of home CPAP therapy, a follow-up sleep study, vigilance and cognitive tests were made. Overall, PFL was significantly higher than PAHS values (PFL: 10.42.6 cmH2O; PAHS: 8.9+/-2.6 cmH2O; p<0.01, mean+/-SD). We found no difference in sleep quality, nocturnal saturation and apnoea/hypopnoea index, or in daytime vigilance tests between the two groups at the end of the treatment period. However, there was a significantly greater scattering in the changes of sleep latency in group II than in group I. This was associated with a significant difference in the daily duration of nasal CPAP use between the two groups (group I: 7.29+/-0.95 h x day(-1); group II: 6.01+/-0.94 h x day(-1); p=0.01) and with a positive correlation between final maintenance of wakefulness test values and the duration of CPAP use (p<0.05; r=0.55).

Auto-CPAP (13 studies): A small, significant difference was observed in compliance but this effect disappeared when we took account of the variation between the studies. There may be a subgroup of patients who respond better than others. Most participants preferred auto-CPAP to fixed CPAP where this was measured. Bi-level PAP (3 studies): No significant differences were observed in compliance. One small study found no difference in preference. Patient titrated CPAP (1 study): No significant difference was observed in compliance. Humidification(1 study): This small study found no significant difference in compliance. Educational/psychological interventions (6 studies): One small study demonstrated superior compliance in patients treated with cognitive behavioural therapy + CPAP versus CPAP alone but only after 12 weeks.

Different pooled analyses gave conflicting results and it may be that carefully selected participants may respond more favourably than others. The evidence in support of Bi-PAP, self-titration and humidification is lacking and studies are required in these areas. There is some evidence that psychological/educational interventions improve CPAP usage. This requires confirmation in larger studies of longer duration, with rigorous follow-up. The cost-benefit ratio of such interventions requires assessment. Future studies need to consider the effects of treatment in participants who are poorly compliant. The studies assembled were characterised by high machine usage in the control groups, and low withdrawal rates making it less likely that any benefit could be demonstrated."

After the initial diagnostic work-up, male patients were considered to be candidates for either nasal continuous airway pressure (nCPAP) (27 patients) or surgical treatment (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with or without mandibular osteotomy) (23 patients). Within the groups, the patients were then randomized to active treatment (nCPAP/surgery) or to conservative management. Cognitive function and severity of OSAS were assessed prior to treatment and 3 and 12 months later. At 12 months, all patients on nCPAP had a normal ODI4 index (< 10), and were significantly less somnolent than their controls; 3/11 of the surgically treated patients had a normal ODI4 index. Daytime somnolence was significantly less severe in the surgically treated patients than in their controls. Cognitive function did not correlate importantly with daytime sleepiness or severity of OSAS; the best Pearson pairwise correlation coefficient was between ODI4 and the Bourdon-Wiersma (r = 0.36). Success in treatment of OSAS did not affect neuropsychological outcome.

This prospective controlled study evaluates the effects of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during 1 yr on daytime functioning in a large group of patients with SAS. The authors studied 80 patients (mean+/-sem 49+/-1 yrs) with SAS with a mean apnoea-hypopnoea index of 60+/-2 h-1, and 80 healthy control subjects matched for sex and age (46+/-1 yrs.). Measurements were obtained at the beginning of the study and 12+/-1 months later, and included: daytime sleepiness (Epworth scale), depression and anxiety (Beck tests), vigilance (Steer-Clear) and reaction time (Psychometer Vigilance Test 192). Drug, coffee and alcohol intake, as well as the sleep schedule, were also recorded. Results showed that, before treatment, patients were more somnolent (p<0.001), anxious (p<0.01) and depressed (p<0.001) than control subjects. Also, they had a longer reaction time (p<0.05) and poorer vigilance (p<0.01). The use of CPAP improved significantly the levels of somnolence (p<0.0001) and vigilance (p<0.01), but failed to modify anxiety and depression. Reaction time changes were minor. Variables with a potential confounding effect did not change during the study. These results provide firm evidence to substantiate the use of continuous positive airway pressure in patients with sleep apnoea syndrome."

Most children with OSAS can be treated with adenotonsillectomy in the ambulatory surgery center. However, there are children at risk for severe OSAS and for postoperative complications, who will need PICU care. In addition to adenotonsillectomy, OSAS can be treated successfully in referral centers with other surgical approaches and by the use of positive airway pressure.

There is growing evidence that leptin regulation is altered in OSAS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that effective treatment will influence leptin levels in OSAS patients. Serum leptin levels were determined in 86 consecutive patients (aged 57.5 +/- 11.0 yrs) with polysomnographically verified OSAS. In addition, leptin levels were reassessed and treatment efficacy was evaluated by polysomnography after 6 months of therapy. Patients were treated with continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure, a mandibular advancement device or conservatively, depending on the clinical symptoms. Mean serum leptin levels did not change with treatment in the whole study group (7.3 +/- 5.0 versus 7.5 +/- 4.8 ng.mL-1), however, leptin levels decreased in effectively treated patients (8.5 +/- 5.0 versus 7.4 +/- 5.1 ng.mL-1) while they increased in ineffectively treated patients (5.0 +/- 4.0 versus 7.7 +/- 4.1 ng.mL-1). Furthermore, not only was there a significant and independent correlation between the change in leptin levels with treatment and the change in body mass index, but also with the change in apnoea/hypopnoea index. Effective treatment of sleep-disordered breathing may have significant effects on leptin levels in obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients.

Existing evidence points to supine related OSA being attributable to unfavorable airway geometry, reduced lung volume, and an inability of airway dilator muscles to adequately compensate as the airway collapses. The role of arousal threshold and ventilatory control instability in the supine position has however yet to be defined. Crucially, few physiological studies have examined patients in the lateral and supine positions, so there is little information to elucidate how breathing stability is affected by sleep posture. The mechanisms of supine related OSA can be overcome by the use of continuous positive airway pressure. There are conflicting data on the utility of oral appliances, while the effectiveness of weight loss and nasal expiratory resistance remains unclear. Avoidance of the supine posture is efficacious, but long term compliance data and well powered randomized controlled trials are lacking. The treatment of supine related OSA remains largely ignored in major clinical guidelines. Supine OSA is the dominant phenotype of the OSA syndrome. This review explains why the supine position so favors upper airway collapse and presents the available data on the management of patients with supine related OSA."

The association between adipokines and SDB has been recently investigated, though most of the studies were focused on OSAS where intermittent hypoxia characterizing the disease may lead to an inflammatory cascade and to the release of several adipokines, contributing to oxidative stress. Resistin, initially described s an adipokine increasing insulin resistance, has been recently identified as a novel important member of the cytokine family involved in the regulation of inflammation. The aim of our study was to investigate circulating resistin levels in normal weight children with PS. Sixty-five children of normal weight aged between 4 and 14 years of age were selected for habitual snoring. Children with positive polysomnography were excluded from the study. Serum resistin levels were detected in all children with PS. Thirty-three healthy non-snorer children with similar age, sex and BMI were selected as a control group. A significantly higher level of resistin was observed in patients with PS compared to the control group (4.67±1.91 ng/ml vs 3.98±1.58 ng/ml; p<0.01). Patients with inconclusive pulse oximetry showed significantly higher resistin levels than those with negative recordings recordings (5.29±1.91 ng/ml vs 4.20±1.93 ng/ml; p<0.008). Moreover, there was a significant increasing trend between sieric adipokine level and the frequency of snoring (p<0.006).

Apart from disturbing sleep, OSA has also been recognised as a risk factor for hypertension, acute cardiovascular events and metabolic disturbance such as insulin resistance. Several randomised controlled trials demonstrated a positive effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on arterial blood pressure, leading the \"Joint National Council on High Blood Pressure\" to list obstructive sleep apnoea as the first identifiable cause of arterial hypertension.

            "abstract": "Abstract. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) have an accident rate between two and seven times higher than normals. Investigations on accident frequency are based on case history, insurancy reports, and driving simulator investigations. The present controlled study was planned to test whether an increased accident risk could be demonstrated in patients with OSAS before and on CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)-therapy using the driving simulator C.A.R. Driving simulator performance was investigated in 31 patients with polysomnographically confirmed OSAS (apnea-hypopnea-index 24.8 +/- 21.5/h) before, 2 and 42 days after initiation of CPAP and was compared to 10 healthy controls in whom OSAS was excluded by polysomnography. Driving simulator performance was significantly worse in OSAS as compared to normals especially in terms of accident frequency (OSAS: 2.7 +/- 2.0, controls: 1.3 +/- 1.5, p < 0.05) and concentration faults (OSAS: 12.4 +/- 5.1, controls: 7.1 +/- 3.2, p < 0.01). On CPAP accident frequency (OSAS before therapy: 12.4 +/- 5.1, 2 days CPAP: 1.5 +/- 1.4, p < 0.01; 42 days CPAP: 0.9 +/- 1.3, p < 0.001) and frequency of concentration faults (OSAS before therapy: 12.4 +/- 5.1, 2 days CPAP: 6.5 +/- 3.9, p < 0.001; 42 days CPAP: 4.9 +/- 3.3, p < 0.001) could be lowered significantly both in the short and medium term of therapy. The driving simulator C.A.R. is an adequate tool for the evaluation of an increased accident risk in OSAS-patients and demonstrates the efficiency of CPAP-therapy."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a form of sleep disordered breathing with a high prevalence rate and is often underdiagnosed. OSA is associated with hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. The presence of OSA may be a strong predictor of fatal cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increased sympathetic drive, activation of metabolic and inflammatory markers, and impaired vascular function are some of the proposed mechanisms that could explain the association between OSA and cardiovascular diseases. Understanding these mechanisms is important for identifying treatment strategies. The presence of OSA should be considered in clinical practice, especially in patients with CVD. Randomized intervention studies are needed to establish whether early identification and treatment of OSA patients reduces cardiovascular morbidity."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep-disordered breathing with potential long-term major neurocognitive and cardiovascular sequelae. The pathophysiology of OSA varies between individuals and is composed of different underlying mechanisms. Several components including the upper airway anatomy, effectiveness of the upper airway dilator muscles such as the genioglossus, arousal threshold of the individual, and inherent stability of the respiratory control system determine the pathogenesis of OSA. Their recognition may have implications for the perioperative health care team. For example, OSA patients with a high arousal threshold are likely to be sensitive to sedatives and narcotics with a higher risk of respiratory arrest in the perioperative period. Supplemental oxygen therapy can help to stabilize breathing in OSA patients with inherent respiratory instability. Avoidance of supine position can minimize airway obstruction in patients with a predisposition to upper airway collapse in this posture. In this review, the clinically relevant endotypes and phenotypes of OSA are described. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice for most patients with OSA but tolerance and adherence can be a problem. Patient-centered individualized approaches to OSA management will be the focus of future research into developing potential treatment options that will help decrease the disease burden and improve treatment effectiveness."

            "abstract": "Self-adjusted Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or autoCPAP machines have been engineered to automatically adjust the pressure to maintain the upper airway patency. They can be used for titration or long-term home therapy. They have been developed to improve efficiency and compliance of CPAP treatment and the cost-effectiveness of titration and also to decrease the long waiting lists for manual titration. For the treatment, it is believed, but not demonstrated, that compliance may be increased by lowering the optimal pressure. Most machines are piloted by an algorithm based on detection of various combination of respiratory events such as apnoeas, hypopnoeas, snoring, inspiratory flow limitation or impedance. Several short-term studies have shown that autoCPAP reduces the indices of respiratory events and microarousals. In general, optimal CPAP determined automatically are identical or lower than evaluated manually by experienced technicians. However, the long-term benefits of auto-CPAP on compliance have not been determined and require further controlled clinical studies taking account not only compliance, but also sleep quality, quality of life, alertness and cognition for each autoCPAP. The cost-effectiveness of auto-titration versus conventional titration remains also to be established."

TLC-CPAP monitors patients' self-reported behaviour and CPAP-related symptoms and provides feedback and counselling through a structured dialogue to enhance motivation to use CPAP. A Sleep Symptoms Checklist, the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale and the Psychomotor Vigilance Task were administered at study entry and at 6-month and 12-month follow-up.

For secondary analysis, the effect of CPAP adherence on the secondary outcomes was analysed.

            "abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome (OSAS) is a common disorder, characterised by repetitive episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep and associated with increasing respiratory efforts. These perturbations lead, in turn, to oxyhaemoglobin desaturation, sleep fragmentation, and daytime symptoms, mainly excessive sleepiness. Accumulating evidence suggests that intermittent hypoxia and oxyhaemoglobin desaturation may result, independently of obesity, in impaired glucose metabolism, as well as insulin resistance even in non-diabetic patients with OSAS. Additionally, OSAS has been proposed as an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for OSAS, since it eliminates upper airway collapse during sleep and also improves sleep fragmentation, daytime symptoms and quality of life. Moreover, it has been proposed that the amelioration of breathing disturbances during sleep can improve several markers of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance, such as glycated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance. Indeed, some studies have reported improvements in these parameters especially in compliant patients. However, other works failed to confirm this beneficial effect. The present article reviews the issue whether CPAP treatment exerts a beneficial effect on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance."

Because of a possible difference between the level of compliance (mean number of hours of use per 24 h) needed for symptomatic relief of OSA versus cardiovascular improvement, the level of hourly compliance in chronic nCPAP users may be important. The first part of this study prospectively examines compliance in a stable population of OSA patients already using nCPAP for 6 months to 2 yr. The second part is a prospective randomized, crossover study examining the effect of weekly (three times) then monthly (twice) positive reinforcement on hourly compliance of new nCPAP users for 3 months versus no reinforcement for 3 months. Positive reinforcement consisted of telephone discussions with the patients about the severity or complications of OSA, benefits of nCPAP, and suggestions about minimizing side effects. Using self-assessment scales, each patient reported the perceived level of improvement from the untreated to the treated condition and the prevalence and severity of side effects from the nCPAP therapy. The level of compliance in stable, chronic nCPAP users with OSA was 6.1 +/- 2.2 h/24 h (n = 9).

In nearly 60 % of patients, platelets activation remained high despite significant improvement of sleep apnea-episodes after N-CPAP. These patients had significantly higher incidence of previous myocardial infarction and/or cerebral infarction and abnormalities of head MRI and carotid sonograpy; indicating that the platelet activation appears to be induced by existing atheroma plaque and not by sympathetic activity in OSAS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In conclusion, patients with OSAS have increased percentages of activated platelets as assessed by flow cytometrical analysis of activation dependent surface markers, and were divided into two groups, one group with response to N-CPAP treatment in the reduction of platelet activation and the other without. One possible reason of no response to N-CPAP treatment in the reduction of platelet activation was suggested to be thrombotic diseases."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Obstructive sleep apnoea is the periodic reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of breathing due to narrowing or occlusion of the upper airway during sleep. The main symptom is daytime sleepiness and it has been suggested it is linked to premature death, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and road traffic accidents.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The main treatment for sleep apnoea is with the use of continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which requires a flow generator and mask. These are used at night to prevent apnoea, hypoxia and sleep disturbance. The objective was to assess the effects of CPAP in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and reference lists of articles. We consulted experts in the field. Searches were current to July 2005.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised trials comparing nocturnal CPAP with an inactive control or oral appliances in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea (an apnoea and hypopnoea index greater than five per hour). Trials had a minimum intervention period of two weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Trial quality was assessed and two review authors extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Parallel and crossover group trials were analysed separately.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six trials involving 1718 people met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was mixed. Compared with control, CPAP showed significant improvements in objective and subjective sleepiness and several quality of life, cognitive function and depression measures (parallel-group studies: Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) -3.83 units, 95% CI -4.57 to -3.09; crossover studies: ESS -1.84 units, 95% CI -2.57 to -1.11). Twenty-four hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower with CPAP compared with control (parallel-group trials). Compared with oral appliances, CPAP significantly reduced the apnoea and hypopnoea index (crossover studies: -7.97 events/hr, 95% CI -9.56 to -6.38) and improved sleep efficiency (crossover studies: 2.31%, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.6) and minimum oxygen saturation (4.14%, 95% CI 3.25 to 5.03). Responders to both treatments expressed a strong preference for the oral appliance. However, participants were more likely to withdraw on OA than on CPAP therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CPAP is effective in reducing symptoms of sleepiness and improving quality of life measures in people with moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It is more effective than oral appliances in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain people tend to prefer oral appliances to CPAP where both are effective. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of controlling OSA. Short-term data indicate that CPAP leads to lower blood pressure than in controls. Long-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in short-term clinical trials persist."

Ten sequential subjects (mean AHI 52.9 x h(-1)) were enrolled. After a manual titration, subjects were randomly allocated to 2 months autoadjusting nasal CPAP (AutoSet), followed by 2 months with the AutoSet device in fixed pressure mode at the manually titrated pressure, or vice versa. The machine-scored AHI, P50, and median leak were recorded on 12 nights in each arm, and averaged. Mean+/-SEM AHI was 4.0+/-0.3 x h(-1) in auto mode, and 3.7+/-0.3 x h(-1) in manual mode (NS). Mean+/-SEM P50 was 7.2+/-0.4 cmH2O auto, 9.4+/-0.6 cmH2O manual, average reduction 23+/-4% (p<0.0001).

Compliance was 6.3+/-0.4 h in auto mode and 6.1+/-0.5 h in fixed mode (NS). Apnoea/hypopnoea index during 2 months of home autoadjusting nasal continuous positive airway pressure is comparable to that during conventionally titrated fixed pressure continuous positive airway pressure, while affording a 23% reduction in median pressure but no increase in compliance. Leak did not importantly affect autoadjustment."

We measured (a) the minimum nasal (CPAP) required to eliminate snoring, (b) the number of hypopneas and apneas during each hour of sleep and (c) the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) by ear oximetry. On the alcohol night there was a significant increase in the CPAP pressure required to eliminate snoring (placebo 4.8 +/- 1.7 cm H2O, alcohol 6.2 +/- 1.5 cm H2O).

Of a population of 110 subjects (58 men) diagnosed as having UARS, we investigated acute systolic and diastolic BP changes seen during sleep in two different samples. First, six patients from the original subject pool were found to have untreated chronic borderline high BP, and were subjected to 48 h of continuous ambulatory BP monitoring before treatment and another 48 h of BP monitoring 1 month after the start of nasal-continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) treatment. Five of six subjects used their equipment on a regular basis and had their chronic borderline high BP completely controlled. No change in BP values was seen in the last subject, who discontinued N-CPAP after 3 days. A second protocol investigated seven normotensive subjects drawn from the initial subject pool. Continuous radial artery BP recording was performed during nocturnal sleep with simultaneous polygraphic recording of sleep/wake variables and respiration. BP changes were studied during periods of increased respiratory efforts and at the time of alpha EEG arousals. Increases in systolic and diastolic BP were noted during the breaths with the greatest inspiratory efforts without significant hypoxemia. A further increase in BP was noted in association with arousals. Three of these subjects also underwent echocardiography during sleep, which demonstrated a leftward shift of the interventricular septum with pulsus paradoxus in association with peak end-inspiratory esophageal pressure more negative than -35 cm H2O. Our study indicates that, in the absence of classic apneas, hypopneas, and repetitive significant drops in oxygen saturation (below 90%), repetitive increases in BP can occur as a result of increased airway resistance during sleep. It also shows that, in some patients with both UARS and borderline high BP, high BP can be controlled with treatment of UARS. We conclude that abnormal upper airway resistance during sleep, often associated with snoring, can play a role in the development of hypertension."

Conversely, OSAS patients with a scarce compliance to CPAP therapy did not change serum vitamin D levels after one year (n = 10, p > 0.05). OSAS patients with beneficial CPAP treatment showed higher vitamin D serum levels after one year and a more frequent shift from insufficient to sufficient vitamin D status compared to OSAS patients not adequately using CPAP treatment. In particular, the obese OSAS patients subgroup shifted from insufficient (≤20 ng/mL) to sufficient (>20 ng/mL) vitamin D status after CPAP therapy more than the non-obese OSAS patients subgroup (p < 0.05). We observed higher Δ of vitamin D serum levels, Epworth Sleepiness Scale score, and AHI in obese compared to non-obese OSAS patients. Finally, BMI obtained at baseline positively correlated with Δ of vitamin D serum levels.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      This study documented that long-term CPAP treatment is a viable therapeutic choice for correcting both sleep apnea condition and vitamin D deficiency in middle-aged male OSAS patients. Significantly, this effect was more evident in obese subjects and possibly represents a valid therapeutic strategy to ensure sufficient vitamin D levels in these patients, which frequently show a deficient vitamin D status."

Such patients experience repeated episodes of progressively diminishing ventilation associated with desaturation followed by periods of increasing-amplitude ventilation. The mechanism appears to be related to hyperventilation leading to hypocapnia which occurs near a critical threshold of apnea during sleep stages I and stage II and interrupts central ventilatory control. The total duration of the periodic respiration cycle would depend on the increased circulation time subsequent to lowered cardiac output. Brief periods of waking provoked by Cheyne-Stokes respiration, accentuating sympathetic nervous system activity, are an unfavorable prognostic factor in heart failure. Activation of the sympathetic system may be corrected by CPAP although the long-term effect on heart failure remains controversial. Other treatments, such as oxygen therapy or theophylline, combined with optimized treatment of heart failure, have been proposed."

Obstructive sleep apnoea is a direct consequence of quadriplegia and is associated with neurocognitive deficits, sleepiness and reduced quality of life. The usual treatment for sleep apnoea is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); however, this is poorly tolerated in quadriplegia. To encourage patients to use this therapy, we have to demonstrate that the benefits outweigh the inconvenience. We therefore propose a prospective, multinational randomized controlled trial of three months of CPAP for obstructive sleep apnoea after acute quadriplegia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      Specialist spinal cord injury centres across Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Canada will recruit medically stable individuals who have sustained a (new) traumatic quadriplegia (complete or incomplete second cervical to first thoracic level lesions). Participants will be screened for obstructive sleep apnoea using full, portable sleep studies. Those with an apnoea hypopnoea index greater than 10 per hour will proceed to an initial three-night trial of CPAP. Those who can tolerate CPAP for at least 4 hours on at least one night of the initial trial will be randomized to either usual care or a 3-month period of auto-titrating CPAP. The primary hypothesis is that nocturnal CPAP will improve neuropsychological functioning more than usual care alone. The secondary hypothesis is that the magnitude of improvement of neuropsychological function will be predicted by the severity of baseline sleepiness measures, sleep fragmentation and sleep apnoea. Neuropsychological tests and full polysomnography will be performed at baseline and 3 months with interim measures of sleepiness and symptoms of autonomic dysfunction measured weekly. Spirometry will be performed monthly. Neuropsychological tests will be administered by blinded assessors. Recruitment commenced in July 2009.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this trial will demonstrate the effect of nocturnal CPAP treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in acute quadriplegia.

In contrast to obstructive sleep apnea due to upper airway collapse during sleep, central sleep apnea (CSA) is mainly due to an instability of the breathing control system. Causes of central sleep apnea include alveolar hypoventilation disorders, heart failure, neurologic and autonomic disorders and idiopathic forms of CSA. Patients with idiopathic CSA often complain of insomnia and awakening during sleep but may also suffer from daytime sleepiness. Cheyne-Stokes-Respiration or peridic breathing is often associated with heart failure and neurological disorders especially those involving the brainstem. In heart failure periodic breathing has enormous prognostic implications. Treatment options for central sleep apnea are oxygen supplementation, medical therapy (i.e. acetazolamide) and CPAP. For patients with central sleep apnoea associated with alveolar hypoventilation nasal ventilation is treatment of choice. Newer nasal ventilation techniques (BiPAP, AutoSetCS) are under investigation for heart failure patients with Cheyne-Stokes-Respiration."

To investigate this, we measured loop gain in healthy elderly individuals using proportional assist ventilation. Loop gain is an engineering term that describes the stability of a system controlled by feedback loops, such as the respiratory control system. A loop gain close to zero indicates a stable system, whereas a loop gain close to or greater than one indicates an unstable system. Eleven healthy elderly subjects were studied with a mean +/- S.D. age and body mass index (BMI) of 71 +/- 5 years and 25 +/- 3 kg m(-2), respectively. We also studied a small group of elderly individuals with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) for comparison (n = 3, age 68 +/- 1 years, BMI 32 +/- 11 kg m(-2)). Comparisons were made with previously studied young individuals (age 27 +/- 4 years, BMI 23 +/- 1 kg m(-2)). We found significantly lower loop gains in the healthy elderly group (loop gain <or= 0.25) compared with the young group (loop gain <or= 0.47, P = 0.001). Also, we found quite low loop gains in the elderly OSA group (loop gain <or= 0.26). We conclude that the chemical control of breathing does not become unstable with ageing and is thus an unlikely cause of central (and possibly obstructive) apnoeas in this population."

Under CPAP therapy all respiratory variables improved and normalized, while under theophylline only the apnea-hypopnea index and the desaturation index improved but still did not return to normal values. Regarding sleep initiation and maintenance, CPAP therapy prolonged sleep latency and reduced movement time, while patients treated with theophylline showed reduced total sleep period, total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Sleep architecture demonstrated an increase in deep sleep and REM stages under CPAP therapy, and remained unchanged under theophylline. Concerning subjective sleep and awakening quality, both treatments improved well-being in the morning. Regarding objective awakening quality, reaction time performance was improved in both groups. In conclusion, CPAP treatment is more effective than theophylline regarding respiratory variables as well as the normalization of sleep maintenance and sleep architecture in sleep apnea patients."

            "abstract": "Many patient with, or at risk of, cardiovascular disease have sleep disordered breathing (SDB), which can be either obstructive (with intermittent collapse of the upper airway) or central (episodic loss of respiratory drive). SDB is associated with sleep disturbance, hypoxemia, hemodynamic changes, and sympathetic activation. Such patients have a worse prognosis than those without SDB. Mask-based therapies of positive airway pressure targeted at SDB can improve measures of sleep quality and partially normalize the sleep and respiratory physiology, but recent randomized trials of cardiovascular outcomes in SDB have either been neutral (obstructive sleep apnea) or suggested the possibility of harm, likely from increased sudden death, in central sleep apnea. Alternative methods for the treatment of SDB are being explored, including implantable technologies, but these have not been studied in adequately powered randomized controlled studies. International guidelines recommend screening for SDB, which can be done easily in clinical practice, as there may be a role for the treatment of patients with obstructive sleep apnea and daytime sleepiness, or resistant hypertension, or atrial fibrillation. Further randomised outcome studies are required to determine whether mask-based treatment for SDB is appropriate for patients with chronic systolic heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea; for those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; and for those with decompensated heart failure. The case is made that no longer can the surrogate endpoints of improvement in respiratory and sleep metrics be taken as adequate therapeutic outcome measures in patients with sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease."

Thus, it needs to be recognized and treated early in order to avoid or attenuate the chronic problems associated with OSAS, which are deleterious to a child's development. Adenotonsillectomy and, in select cases, continuous positive airwaypressure (CPAP) have been the preferred treatments for OSAS in children, and yet they are ineffective at fully ameliorating the disease. Minimally invasive treatments have recently been proposed, comprising intra-oral and extra-oral devices as well as speech therapy.

            "abstract": "The influence of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on left ventricular function remains controversial. We examined the influence of OSAS on global left ventricular function using the myocardial performance index (Tei index) and plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level and investigated the effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) on these parameters. We obtained echocardiographic indexes including the Tei index and BNP concentrations from 27 patients with OSAS whose mean apnea-hypopnea index was 42.2+/-21.5 events/hour and who were undergoing nCPAP and from 22 control subjects. We defined global left ventricular dysfunction (GLVD) as a Tei index >or=0.50 and high BNP as >or=20 pg/ml. Compared with controls, the Tei index of patients with OSAS was significantly increased (p <0.01) and prevalence of GLVD was high (19%, p<0.05). The correlation between the Tei index and apnea-hypopnea index was significant (r=0.447, p<0.05). Although BNP levels were higher in patients with OSAS than in controls, the difference did not reach significance. BNP level was high in 37% of patients with OSAS and in only 9% of controls (p<0.05). The Tei index of patients with OSAS was significantly decreased after 1 month and 3 months of nCPAP (p<0.01), and prevalence of GLVD significantly decreased from 19% to 4% (p<0.05). In contrast, BNP significantly decreased at 3 months after nCPAP (p<0.05). In conclusion, patients with moderate to severe OSAS frequently have impaired global left ventricular myocardial performance, which can be reversed at the early stage after starting nCPAP."

Outcome measurements included home sleep study, sleepiness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cognitive tests, side-effects, compliance and preference. The median (interquartile range) AHI was 2 (1-8) events x h(-1) with CPAP and 6 (3-14) events x h(-1) with MAd (p<0.001). Positive and negative predictive values of MAd titration PSG for treatment success were 85% and 45%, respectively. Both treatments significantly improved subjective and objective sleepiness, cognitive tests and HRQoL. The reported compliance was higher for MAd (p<0.001) with >70% of patients preferring this treatment. These results support titrated MAd as an effective therapy in moderately sleepy and overweight OSAHS patients. Although less effective than CPAP, successfully titrated MAd was very effective at reducing the AHI and was associated with a higher reported compliance. Both treatments improved functional outcomes to a similar degree. One-night titration of MAd had a low negative predictive value for treatment success."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Following the World Trade Center disaster, a large number of individuals involved in rescue and recovery activity were exposed to significant amounts of dust, and reported symptoms of chronic nasal and sinus inflammation. An unusually high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has also been observed in this World Trade Center Responder population. This project aims to examine the relationship between nasal pathology and OSA. Our hypothesis is that increased nasal resistance due to nasal inflammation predisposes to OSA in this population. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the standard therapy for OSA but despite its efficacy has poor adherence. Subjects with high nasal resistance may have greater difficulty in tolerating this therapy than those who do not have high nasal resistance. Reduction of excess expiratory positive pressure by the modality known as Cflex(™) during Continuous Positive Airway Pressure therapy (CPAP(Flex)) has been suggested to improve comfort without compromising efficacy. We will compare CPAP to CPAP(Flex) in subjects with OSA.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Subjects with new onset habitual snoring will be screened for OSA using home sleep studies and rhinomanometry will be used to determine nasal resistance.

We anticipate the following results from this trial: 1. Increased nasal resistance is associated with decreased adherence to CPAP therapy. 2. Use of CPAP(Flex) improves adherence with CPAP therapy in subjects with high nasal resistance, but not in those with low nasal resistance. 3. The benefit of CPAP(Flex) on adherence is greatest when offered at CPAP therapy initiation rather than as a \"rescue\" therapy in subjects with high nasal resistance.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01753999, Date: 12 December 2012."

The primary outcomes of interest were subjective daytime sleepiness assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and objective sleepiness assessed by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). A new economic model was developed to assess incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The cost-effectiveness of CPAP was compared with that of the use of dental devices and conservative management. The costs and QALYs were compared over a lifetime time horizon. Effectiveness was based on the RCT evidence on sleepiness symptoms (ESS), which was 'mapped' to utilities using individual patient data from a subset of studies. Utilities were expressed on the basis of generic HRQoL instruments [the EQ-5D (EuroQoL-5 Dimensions) in the base-case analysis]. The base-case analysis focused on a male aged 50. A series of subgroup and scenario analyses were also undertaken.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The searches yielded 6325 citations, from which 48 relevant clinical effectiveness studies were identified, 29 of these providing data on daytime sleepiness. The majority of the included RCTs did not report using an adequate method of allocation concealment or use an intention-to-treat analysis. Only the studies using a sham CPAP comparator were double blinded. There was a statistically significant benefit with CPAP compared with control (placebo and conservative treatment/usual care) on the ESS [mean difference (MD) -2.7 points, 95% CI -3.45 to -1.96]. However, there was statistical heterogeneity, which was reduced when trials were subgrouped by severity of disease. There was also a significant benefit with CPAP compared with usual care on the MWT. There was a non-statistically significant difference between CPAP and dental devices (six trials) in the impact on daytime sleepiness (ESS) among a population with moderate symptom severity at baseline (MD -0.9, 95% CI -2.1 to 0.4). A review of five studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of CPAP was undertaken. All existing cost-effectiveness studies had limitations; therefore a new economic model was developed, based on which it was found that, on average, CPAP was associated with higher costs and benefits than dental devices or conservative management. The incremental cost per QALY gained of CPAP was below 20,000 pounds in the base-case analysis and most alternative scenarios. There was a high probability of CPAP being more cost-effective than dental devices and conservative management for a cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 pounds per QALY gained.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CPAP is an effective and cost-effective treatment for OSAHS compared with conservative/usual care and placebo in populations with moderate to severe daytime sleepiness, and there may be benefits when the disease is mild. Dental devices may be a treatment option in moderate disease but some uncertainty remains. Further research would be potentially valuable, particularly investigation of the effectiveness of CPAP for populations with mild sleepiness and further trials comparing CPAP with dental devices."

The present study evaluated whether in patients with various types of sleep apnea a significant decrease in the HCVR could be found (COMPARATIVE STUDY). In a second part of the study chronic CPAP therapy (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) was evaluated in relation to control of breathing (CPAP STUDY). In the comparative study a significant increase of the slope in the normocapnic OSA and overlap group could be seen. A depressed HCVR could only be observed in chronic hypercapnic OSA. In the CPAP-study it was shown that changes in the AHI after CPAP do not parallel the HCVR. We conclude that in eucapnic OSA patients CPAP therapy does not change CO2 drive.

In HF patients, it is characterized by periodic breathing also known as the Cheyne-Stokes respiration followed by pauses of breathing. Central sleep apnoea remains often unrecognized due to its chronic and insidious incidences. Patients may report excessive daytime somnolence, poor sleep quality, nocturnal angina, recurrent arrhythmias, refractory HF symptoms, or demonstrate abnormal respiratory pattern or apnoeas. The pathogenesis of CSA remains incompletely understood, but changes in CO2 above and below the apnoea threshold play a major role in its pathogenesis. The presence of CSA in patients with HF is associated with some neurohumoral and haemodynamic responses that are detrimental to the failing heart including increased morbidity and mortality. The development of successful therapies targeting CSA and its harmful downstream effects is therefore important. Several different therapies from medications to implantable devices have been tested with varying effects and primarily in small non-randomized and/or single-centre studies. Large studies to date have been disappointing, but therapeutic options targeting the physiology of the disease may herald a new era in understanding and treating CSA."

There is good evidence of beneficial effect of the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on the quality of life of patients with OSA. Improvements in HRQOL are most appreciable in patients with moderate to severe OSA, although they also seem to be present in selected patients with mild OSA. The effects of dental devices and surgical procedures on HRQOL of patients with OSA have not been studied in randomized, placebo-controlled trials.

We hypothesized that the influence of ventilatory instability in this disorder would vary depending on the underlying collapsibility of the upper airway. To test this hypothesis, we correlated loop gain with apnea-hypopnea index during supine, nonrapid eye movement sleep in three groups of patients with obstructive sleep apnea based on pharyngeal closing pressure: negative pressure group (pharyngeal closing pressure less than -1 cm H(2)O), atmospheric pressure group (between -1 and +1 cm H(2)O), and positive pressure group (greater than +1 cm H(2)O). Loop gain was measured by sequentially increasing proportional assist ventilation until periodic breathing developed, which occurred in 24 of 25 subjects. Mean loop gain for all three groups was 0.37 +/- 0.11. A significant correlation was found between loop gain and apnea-hypopnea index in the atmospheric group only (r = 0.88, p = 0.0016). We conclude that loop gain has a substantial impact on apnea severity in certain patients with sleep apnea, particularly those with a pharyngeal closing pressure near atmospheric."

Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown them to be an effective treatment option for snoring and OSA in some patients, particularly patients with less severe OSA or simple snoring and patients who have failed other treatment modalities. Although oral appliances are not as effective as CPAP therapy, they work in most patients to relieve symptoms and apnea and are well tolerated by patients. Most patients report improvements in sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. Short-term side effects are generally minor and are related to excessive salivation, jaw and tooth discomfort, and occasional joint discomfort. These symptoms may lead to discontinuation of appliance therapy but usually improve in most patients over time. Serious complications are not common, but occlusal changes are more common than previously believed."

Finally, the improvements in quality of life in trials do not appear to reflect the dramatic changes noted in clinical practice. There should be a greater focus on patient centred outcomes which would better capture the symptomatic improvement with CPAP treatment and translate these improvements into outcomes which could be used in health economic analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN90464927.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 19, No. 40.

            "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome, i. e., the combined occurrence of obesity, arterial hypertension, insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia (increased triglycerides, reduced HDL cholesterol), is associated with a marked increase in cardiovascular risk. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is very high. Obesity is the main risk factor for OSA and OSA itself is now considered to be the most frequent cause of secondary arterial hypertension. Due to the confounding influence of obesity, the causal connection between OSA and metabolic disturbances is less well established, however, epidemiological data are at least in favour of an independent link between OSA and insulin resistance. It is known that CPAP therapy can ameliorate OSA-associated hypertension. In contrast, the effects of CPAP treatment on insulin resistance and dyslipidaemia have to be further elucidated by large, randomised interventional trials."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The treatment of choice for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) via a mask during sleep. However this is not tolerated by all patients and its role in mild OSA is not proven. Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be of value in patients intolerant of CPAP. A number of mechanisms have been proposed by which drugs could reduce the severity of OSA. These include an increase in tone in the upper airway dilator muscles, an increase in ventilatory drive, a reduction in the proportion of REM sleep, an increase in cholinergic tone during sleep, a reduction in airway resistance and a reduction in surface tension in the upper airway.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To determine the efficacy of drug therapies in the treatment of sleep apnoea.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We carried out searches on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials.

We excluded trials if continuous positive airways pressure, mandibular devices or oxygen therapy were used. No restriction was placed upon publication language or trial duration.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion, undertook data extraction according to pre-specified entry criteria, and quality assessment of studies. No response for further information was forthcoming from study authors. Results were expressed as mean differences and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI).\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-six trials of 21 drugs, involving 394 participants contributed data to the review. Most of the studies were small and many trials had methodological limitations. Each of the studies states that the subjects had OSA but diagnostic criteria were not always explicit and it is possible that some patients with central apnoeas may have been recruited. Six drugs had some impact on OSA severity and two altered daytime symptoms. One study reported that apnoea hypopnea index (AHI) was lower following treatment with intranasal fluticasone compared with placebo (23.3 versus 30.3) in 24 participants with sleep apnoea and rhinitis. Subjective alertness in the daytime also improved. Physostigmine gave an AHI of 41 compared to 54 on placebo (10 participants) and in a similar study Mirtazipine 15 mg produced an AHI of 13 compared to 23.7 for placebo (10 participants). Topical nasal lubricant given twice overnight resulted in an AHI of 14 compared to 24 with placebo (10 participants). These three latter studies were of single night crossover design and so there are no data on the acceptability of these treatments or their effect on symptoms. Paroxetine was shown to reduce AHI to 23.3 compared to 30.3 for placebo, most of the 20 participants tolerated the treatment but there was no improvement in daytime symptoms. Acetazolamide also reduced the AHI (one crossover trial of nine patients, mean difference 24 (95% CI 4 to 44). However there was no symptomatic benefit from the drug and it was poorly tolerated in the long term. Protriptyline led to a symptomatic improvement (improved versus not improved) in two out of three crossover trials (13 participants, Peto Odds Ratio 29.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 301.1) but there was no change in the apnoea frequency. In one trial naltrexone did reduce AHI, but total sleep time favoured placebo. No significant beneficial effects were found for medroxy progesterone, clonidine, mibefradil, cilazapril, buspirone, aminophylline, theophylline doxapram, ondansetron or sabeluzole.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of drug therapy in the treatment of OSA. Small studies have reported positive effects of certain agents on short-term outcome. Certain agents have been shown to reduce the AHI in largely unselected populations with OSA by between 24 and 45%. For fluticasone, mirtazipine, physostigmine and nasal lubricant, studies of longer duration are required to establish whether this has an impact on daytime symptoms. Individual patients had more complete responses to particular drugs. It is likely that better matching of drugs to patients according to the dominant mechanism of their OSA will lead to better results and this also needs further study."

            "abstract": "Obesity is both a cause and a possible consequence of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), as OSA seems to affect parameters involved in energy balance regulation, including food intake, hormonal regulation of hunger/satiety, energy metabolism and physical activity. It is known that weight loss improves OSA, yet it remains unclear why continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) often results in weight gain.The goal of this systematic review is to explore if and how CPAP affects the behaviour and/or metabolism involved in regulating energy balance.CPAP appears to correct for a hormonal profile characterised by abnormally high leptin and ghrelin levels in OSA, by reducing the circulating levels of each. This is expected to reduce excess food intake. However, reliable measures of food intake are lacking, and not yet sufficient to make conclusions. Although studies are limited and inconsistent, CPAP may alter energy metabolism, with reports of reductions in resting metabolic rate or sleeping metabolic rate. CPAP appears to not have an appreciable effect on altering physical activity levels. More work is needed to characterise how CPAP affects energy balance regulation.It is clear that promoting CPAP in conjunction with other weight loss approaches should be used to encourage optimal outcomes in OSA patients."

Arousal state and respiratory events were scored in accordance with American Academy of Sleep Medicine guidelines. Data on opioid boluses in the PACU were collected.

Ambulatory blood pressure was also measured before and after treatment in 11 patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and their matched control subjects. 3. Compared with matched control subjects, untreated obstructive sleep apnoea and snoring were not associated with an increase in daytime blood pressure.

Both therapies substantially reduced the AHI (APAP 9.8±9.5 and CPAP 7.3±6.6 events h(-1) ; P=0.35), but residual PSG measures of disease (AHI >5) were common. APAP delivered a significantly lower 95th percentile pressure averaged over the home-use arm than CPAP (14.2±2.7 and 16.1±1.8 cmH(2)O, respectively, P=0.02). The machine-scored AHI significantly overestimated the level of residual disease compared with the laboratory-scored AHI (using Chicago criteria); however, when the machine-scored AHI was ≤5 and ≤10 this was always confirmed by the PSG data. In morbidly obese OSA patients without significant co-morbid disease requiring high therapeutic pressure, our data provide support for the use of either APAP or manually titrated CPAP.

Subjects in the CPAP group used their devices for a median (IQR [range]) of 3 (0.25-5 [0-12]) nights pre-operatively (2.9 (0.1-4.8 [0.0-12.7]) hours per night) and 1 (0-2 [0-2]) nights postoperatively (1.4 (0.0-5.1 [0.0-11.6]) hours per night). Among the CPAP subjects, the residual pre-operative apnoea-hypopnea index had a significant effect on delirium severity (p = 0.0002). Although we confirm that apnoea is associated with postoperative delirium, we did not find that providing a short-course of auto-titrating CPAP affected its likelihood or severity. Voluntary adherence to CPAP is particularly poor during the initiation of therapy."

The passive pharyngeal critical pressure (Pcrit), a measure of upper airway collapsibility, is determined using airway pressure drops. The EELV change during these drops has not been quantified and may differ between obese obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients and controls. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-treated OSA patients and controls were instrumented with an epiglottic catheter, magnetometers (to measure change in EELV), and a nasal mask/pneumotachograph. Subjects slept supine in a head-out plastic chamber in which the extrathoracic pressure could be lowered (to raise EELV) while on nasal CPAP. The magnitude of EELV change during Pcrit measurement (sudden reductions of CPAP for 3-5 breaths each minute) was assessed at baseline and with EELV increased approximately 500 ml. Fifteen OSA patients and 7 controls were studied. EELV change during Pcrit measurement was rapid and pressure dependent, but similar in OSA and control subjects (74 +/- 36 and 59 +/- 24 ml/cmH(2)O respectively, P = 0.33). Increased lung volume (mean +521 ml) decreased Pcrit by a similar amount in OSA and control subjects (-3.1 +/- 1.7 vs. -3.9 +/- 1.9 cmH(2)O, P = 0.31). Important lung volume changes occur during passive Pcrit measurement. However, on average, there is no difference in lung volume change for a given CPAP change between obese OSA subjects and controls. Changes in lung volume alter Pcrit substantially. This work supports a role for lung volume in the pathogenesis of OSA, and lung volume changes should be a consideration during assessment of pharyngeal mechanics."

The primary composite end point was death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack. Secondary end points included other cardiovascular outcomes, health-related quality of life, snoring symptoms, daytime sleepiness, and mood.\n## RESULTS\nMost of the participants were men who had moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and minimal sleepiness. In the CPAP group, the mean duration of adherence to CPAP therapy was 3.3 hours per night, and the mean apnea-hypopnea index (the number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of recording) decreased from 29.0 events per hour at baseline to 3.7 events per hour during follow-up. After a mean follow-up of 3.7 years, a primary end-point event had occurred in 229 participants in the CPAP group (17.0%) and in 207 participants in the usual-care group (15.4%) (hazard ratio with CPAP, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.32; P=0.34). No significant effect on any individual or other composite cardiovascular end point was observed. CPAP significantly reduced snoring and daytime sleepiness and improved health-related quality of life and mood.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nTherapy with CPAP plus usual care, as compared with usual care alone, did not prevent cardiovascular events in patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea and established cardiovascular disease.

Evaluating surgical treatments is complicated because placebo control is usually not feasible with invasive therapies, randomisation to or away from invasive therapy may limit patient enrolment and generalisability, and surgery is a heterogeneous array of procedures and combinations of procedures.

Although convincing data exist that treatment with CPAP can alleviate the neurocognitive sequelae of OSA, data on cardiovascular complications are more limited. Several recent reports support a lowering of nocturnal and daytime blood pressure with CPAP, but data on the prevention of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events are currently lacking. Patient adherence with CPAP can be improved with optimization of mask comfort, heated humidification, and intensive support and education. For those who remain poorly compliant, alternative therapies such as autotitrating devices and oral positive airway pressure can be considered.

In the general population, CVD events peak at 9:00-10:00 AM, associated with diurnal changes in thrombotic potential. However in OSA, these CVD events occur frequently at night. Measuring thrombotic potential across the sleep-wake cycle may provide insight into the temporal association of OSA with CVD. This study aimed to determine diurnal changes in fibrin generation in OSA and whether treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alters fibrin generation across the sleep-wake cycle. In a randomised placebo-controlled crossover trial, patients with OSA were assigned to two months each of therapeutic CPAP and placebo. After each treatment period, fibrin generation was determined by overall haemostatic potential assay at seven time points over 24 hours (h). Twenty-eight patients (25 men, 3 women) with severe OSA (Apnoea Hypopnoea Index = 37.9 ± 23.9/h, Oxygen Desaturation Index 31.3 ± 22.4/h) completed the study.

CPAP produced no change in fibrin generation parameters compared to placebo. In severe OSA patients, fibrin generation peaked at 6:00 AM and 9:00 AM rather than during the sleep period (midnight and 3:00 AM).

None of the subjects had clinically significant enlargement of the tonsils or adenoids, nor had any undergone previous tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy. Airway collapsibility was measured by brief (2-breath duration) and sudden reductions in pharyngeal pressure by connecting the breathing mask to a negative pressure source. Negative pressure applications ranging from -1 to -20 cmH(2)O were randomly applied in each subject while respiratory airflow and mask pressure were measured. Flow-pressure curves were constructed for each subject, and the x-intercept gave the pressure at zero flow, the so-called critical pressure of the upper airway (Pcrit). Pcrit was significantly higher in children with SDB than in controls (-10.8 +/- 2.8 vs. -15.7 +/- 1.2 cmH(2)O; P < 0.05).

This study, an extension of the original trial, examined whether the beneficial impacts of NCPAP continued over the longer term. Patients were followed-up 1 month after being placed on active or sub-therapeutic NCPAP. They completed health status measures and a clinical test of sleepiness. After this period, all patients were placed on NCPAP and followed up 5 months later. The beneficial impact of NCPAP on sleep apnoea was sustained on all measures at follow-up. Furthermore, those who had initially been in the sub-therapeutic arm gained scores after 5 months of NCPAP similar to those of the active group. The impact of NCPAP appears sustained in the longer term. Subjective health status instruments have been advocated as important outcome points in randomized trials.

Compared to CPAP, there was no significant advantage of APAP in reducing AHI or sleepiness (pooled APAP-CPAP posttreatment AHI and Epworth Sleepiness Scale score = -0.20 events per hour, 95% confidence interval:[-0.74,0.35], and -0.56 [-1.4,0.3] respectively). The use of APAP reduced the mean applied pressure across the night by 2.2 cm water [1.9,2.5] compared to CPAP. Adherence with therapy was not substantially improved with APAP; pooled estimate of improvement was 0.20 hours per night ([-0.16,0.57], P = .28) using a random-effects model.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Compared to standard CPAP, APAP is associated with a reduction in mean pressure. However, APAP and standard CPAP were similar in adherence and their ability to eliminate respiratory events and to improve subjective sleepiness. Given that APAP is more costly than standard CPAP, APAP should not be considered first-line chronic therapy in all patients with OSA. However, APAP may be useful in other situations (eg, home titrations, detection of mouth leak) or in certain subgroups of patients with OSA. Identifying circumstances in which APAP is a definite improvement over CPAP in terms of costs or effects should be the focus of future studies."

            "abstract": "The objective of this study was to measure the impact of a 6-month delay in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) (apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) < 30) or severe OSAS (AHI > or = 30) on daytime sleepiness, cognitive functions, quality of life and healthcare expenditure (hospitalisations, medical visits, complementary tests, biological tests and drug prescriptions). In addition, this study aimed to analyse the incremental cost effectiveness ratios related to daytime sleepiness or quality of life following immediate introduction of treatment in these two populations. This study was conducted as a multicentre randomised controlled trial and carried out at two teaching hospitals in France. A total of 171 patients were followed for 6 months, with 82 patients randomised to group 1 \"immediate polysomnography\" and 89 in group 2 \"polysomnography within 6 months\". Patients with severe OSAS were deprived of a significant improvement of their daytime sleepiness (5.1 +/- 5.0 at the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score in group 1 versus 0.2 +/- 3.4 in group 2) and quality of life (12.4 +/- 13.3 at the Nottingham Health Profile score in group 1 versus 0.7 +/- 10.1 in group 2) during the waiting time. The impact of delayed management in subjects with less severe OSAS only concerned daytime sleepiness (1.1 +/- 3.3 in group 1 versus 0.3 +/- 4.3 in group 2). Delayed treatment did not affect cognitive functions or healthcare expenditure regardless of the severity of the disease. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios related to rapid introduction of treatment were significantly lower in the patients with more severe OSAS. These results provide fairly clear medical and economic arguments in favour of early management of patients with more severe forms of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome."

Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) versus conservative management (one trial): An un validated symptom score showed intermittent significant differences over a 12-month follow-up period. No differences in Polysomnography (PSG) outcomes were reported. Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP) versus conservative management/placebo (two trials): One study recruited mixed a population, and separate data could not be obtained for this trial. In the other study no significant differences in Epworth scores or quality of life reported. A significant difference in favour of LAUP was reported in terms of apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and frequency and intensity of snoring. UPPP versus oral appliance (OA) (one trial): AHI was significantly lower with OA therapy than with UPPP. No significant differences were observed in quality of life. UPPP versus lateral pharyngoplasty (lateral PP) (one trial): No significant difference in Epworth scores, but a greater reduction in AHI with lateral PP was reported. Tongue advancement (mandibular osteotomy) + PPP versus tongue suspension + PPP (one trial): There was a significant reduction in symptoms in both groups, but no significant difference between the two surgery types. Complications reported with all surgical techniques included nasal regurgitation, pain and bleeding. These did not persist in the long term. An additional study assessed the effects of four different techniques. No data were available on between group comparisons. Multilevel temperature-controlled radiofrequency tissue ablation (TCRFTA) versus sham placebo and CPAP (one trial): There was an improvement in primary and secondary outcomes of TCRFTA over sham placebo and but no difference in symptomatic improvement when compared with CPAP.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There are now a small number of trials assessing different surgical techniques with inactive and active control treatments. The studies assembled in the review do not provide evidence to support the use of surgery in sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome, as overall significant benefit has not been demonstrated. The participants recruited to the studies had mixed levels of AHI, but tended to suffer from moderate daytime sleepiness where this was measured. Short-term outcomes are unlikely to consistently identify suitable candidates for surgery. Long-term follow-up of patients who undergo surgical correction of upper airway obstruction is required. This would help to determine whether surgery is a curative intervention, or whether there is a tendency for the signs and symptoms of sleep apnoea to re-assert themselves, prompting patients to seek further treatment for sleep apnoea."

            "abstract": "The application of inspiratory occlusion stimuli produces cortical responses called respiratory-related evoked potentials (RREPs). During wakefulness the RREP waveform consists of early P1 and Nf components, an N1 and a P300. During non-REM sleep the predominant component is an N550, best seen in the averages of elicited K-complexes. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients have been previously shown to have a normal wake RREP but to have a reduced amplitude N550 and a smaller proportion of elicited K-complexes than controls. The present study tested the hypothesis that this reflects a sleep-specific dampening peculiar to inspiratory effort-related stimuli, by assessing both respiratory and auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) during wakefulness and non-REM sleep in OSAS patients and controls. Auditory tones were presented in an oddball sequence during wakefulness and as a monotonous series during stage 2 sleep. Inspiratory occlusions, delivered for 500 msec via an nCPAP mask were also presented during wakefulness and stage 2 sleep, every three to five breaths. Data were collected from ten OSAS patients and ten controls. There were no significant differences in the amplitudes of the auditory N1 and P3 or the respiratory P1, Nf, N1 or P3 components during wakefulness. The amplitude of the auditory N550 and the proportion of elicited K-complexes did not differ between groups for auditory stimuli presented during stage 2 sleep. The respiratory N550 and K-complex elicitation rate were both significantly reduced in the OSAS group, despite there being no differences in the mask occlusion pressure response to the occlusion. The results confirm a blunted cortical response to inspiratory occlusions that is specific to sleep. The absence of significant group differences in the responses to auditory stimuli highlight that the sleep-related differences seen in OSAS patients are specific to the processing of inspiratory effort related stimuli."

Possible pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to this association include the following: adenotonsillar hypertrophy due to increased somatic growth, increased critical airway closing pressure, altered chest wall mechanics, and abnormalities of ventilatory control. However, the details of these mechanisms and their interactions have not been elucidated. In addition, obesity and OSAS are both associated with metabolic syndrome, which is a constellation of features such as hypertension, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, and prothrombotic and proinflammatory states. There is some evidence that OSAS may contribute to the progression of metabolic syndrome with a potential for significant morbidity. The treatment of OSAS in obese children has not been standardized. Adenotonsillectomy is considered the primary intervention followed by continuous positive airway pressure treatment if OSAS persists. Other methods such as oral appliances, surgery, positional therapy, and weight loss may be beneficial for individual subjects.

The effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment was studied as well. We found that OSA was associated with increased expression of adhesion molecules CD15 and CD11c on monocytes, increased adherence of monocytes in culture to human endothelial cells, increased intracellular ROS production in some monocyte and granulocyte subpopulations, and upregulation of CD15 expression due to hypoxia in vitro in monocytes of control subjects. Furthermore, nCPAP treatment was associated with downregulation of CD15 and CD11c monocyte expression and decreased basal ROS production in CD11c+ monocytes. Monocyte adherence to endothelial cells decreased as well. Our findings provide one of the possible mechanisms for explaining the high rate of cardiovascular morbidity in patients with sleep apnea."

            "abstract": "Nocturnal arousals are the essential cause of disturbed sleep structure in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between sleep stages, respiratory (type-R) and movement (type-M) related EEG arousals. Furthermore, the value of these arousals as a criterion for the efficiency of nCPAP treatment was estimated. We examined 38 male patients aged between 30 and 71 (49.1 +/- 20.9 SD) y. All patients suffered from OSAS. The mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 47.3 +/- 27.8 per h. Polysomnographic monitoring was carried out on 4 subsequent nights: baseline night, 2 nights of nCPAP titration and nCPAP control night. Sleep was visually scored and EEG arousals were classified into type R and M, depending on whether changes of respiration or movement caused the arousal. The RDI, the R index (type-R/h), the M index (type-M/h) and the R and M indices in different sleep stages were calculated. During the baseline night a deficit of slow wave sleep (SWS) and REM sleep was found. Furthermore there were more type-R than type-M arousals registered (17.4 h-1 [3.6-43.6] vs. 5.9 h-1 [1.6-11.8]) (P < 0.01). They occurred during stages NREM 1, NREM 2 and REM (P < 0.01). An SWS sleep rebound and a reduction of the SWS and REM latencies were already found during the first CPAP night. The R index was reduced during the first CPAP night in all sleep stages (P < 0.01) and remained approximately the same in the following 2 nights (3. CPAP night: 1.1 h-1 [0.3-5.0]). Type M arousals occurred more in stages 1 and 2 (P < 0.01), and remained unchanged under nCPAP. We concluded that differentiation of nocturnal arousals may provide more detailed information regarding the influence of breathing disturbances on sleep. Respiratory related, not movement related, arousals may be a useful additional tool in judging the efficiency of OSAS."

Data were complete in 33. In these 33 patients CPAP and APAP reduced the Epworth Sleepiness score from 15+/-1 (+/-SEM) to 8+/-1 and 9+/-1 respectively (both <0.0001 from baseline but NS between modes). The APAP average pressure was lower than the CPAP pressure, 6.4+/-0.4 and 10.6+/-0.4 cm H20, respectively. The average daily machine use was greater with APAP, 6.0+/-0.3 hrs. versus 5.5+/-0.3 hrs. with CPAP (P < 0.04). The number of days of machine use, and the pattern of use were not different between CPAP and APAP. A higher proportion of patients who did not complete the study was randomized to CPAP for their initial treatment period. This study showed that: 1) CPAP and APAP produced an equivalent improvement in daytime sleepiness, 2) APAP pressure was lower than CPAP pressure, 3) patients wore the APAP device longer during nights they used the pressure support system, and 4) patients who began the study with APAP were more prone to continue treatment. We conclude that APAP was better tolerated and used a greater number of hours than CPAP, but the extent of improvement in excessive daytime sleepiness was similar between the two modes of therapy."

Prospective studies have established the adverse cardiovascular consequences of OSA, including an increased risk for developing hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure. However, more studies are needed to better assess the impact of OSA, and possible benefit of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular mortality. The leading pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the changes triggered by OSA include intermittent hypoxemia and re-oxygenation, arousals and changes in intrathoracic pressure. Hypertension is strongly related with activation of the sympathetic nervous system, stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and endothelial dysfunction. OSA should be suspected in hypertensive individuals, particularly in patients with resistant hypertension. CPAP treatment reduces blood pressure, and its effects are more pronounced in patients with high baseline blood pressure and elevated treatment compliance. At present, no clear evidence supports CPAP treatment for primary or secondary cardiovascular disease prevention."

We hypothesized that the genioglossus (GG), the most important pharyngeal dilator muscle, would be abnormal in patients with OSAS. Further, because treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is very effective clinically in these patients, we investigated the effects of CPAP upon the structure and function of the GG. We studied 16 patients with OSAS (nine of them at diagnosis and seven after having been under treatment with CPAP for at least 1 yr) and 11 control subjects in whom OSAS was excluded clinically. A biopsy of the GG was obtained in each subject, mounted in a tissue bath, and stimulated through platinum electrodes. The following measurements were obtained: maximal twitch tension, contraction time, half-relaxation time, the force-frequency relationship, and the response to a fatiguing protocol. The percentage of type I (\"slow twitch\") and type II (\"fast twitch\") fibers was also quantified. Patients with OSAS showed a greater GG fatigability than did control subjects (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Interestingly, this abnormality was entirely corrected by CPAP. Likewise, the percentage of type II fibers was significantly higher in patients with OSAS (59 +/- 4%) than in control subjects (39 +/- 4%, p < 0.001) and, again, these structural changes were corrected by CPAP (40 +/- 3%, p < 0.001). These results show that the function and structure of the GG is abnormal in patients with OSAS. Because these abnormalities are corrected by CPAP, we suggest that they are likely a consequence, not a cause, of the disease."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an underdiagnosed condition characterized by recurrent episodes of obstruction of the upper airway leading to sleep fragmentation and intermittent hypoxia during sleep. Obesity predisposes to OSA, and the prevalence of OSA is increasing worldwide because of the ongoing epidemic of obesity. Recent evidence has shown that surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk, including sympathetic activation, systemic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, are significantly increased in obese patients with OSA versus those without OSA, suggesting that OSA is not simply an epiphenomenon of obesity. Moreover, findings from animal models and patients with OSA show that intermittent hypoxia exacerbates the metabolic dysfunction of obesity, augmenting insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. In patients with the metabolic syndrome, the prevalence of moderate to severe OSA is very high (∼60%). In this population, OSA is independently associated with increased glucose and triglyceride levels as well as markers of inflammation, arterial stiffness, and atherosclerosis. A recent randomized, controlled, crossover study showed that effective treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure for 3 months significantly reduced several components of the metabolic syndrome, including blood pressure, triglyceride levels, and visceral fat. Finally, several cohort studies have consistently shown that OSA is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, independent of obesity. Taken together, these results support the concept that OSA exacerbates the cardiometabolic risk attributed to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. Recognition and treatment of OSA may decrease the cardiovascular risk in obese patients."

Polysomnography (apnea-hypopnea index, AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were used to diagnose OSAS and to verify the efficacy of both treatments. Electrical stimulation treatment was reflected by a decrease in PSQI (p = 0.012) but did not influence ESS and AHI values (p > 0.05). In turn, CPAP therapy resulted in a significant decrease in ESS and AHI values (p < 0.001) but exerted no effect on PSQI (p = 0.089).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Previous, largely uncontrolled studies demonstrated the substantial effects of continuous positive airway pressure ventilation (CPAP) on a variety of physiologic and biochemical markers known to be risk factors for cardiovascular disease in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In this pilot crossover study, we assessed (1) the feasibility of using CPAP in a group of minimally symptomatic patients with OSA, assessed through patient compliance and (2) CPAP therapy's effect on biomarkers in these patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We studied patients with minimal daytime sleepiness who were referred to the University of British Columbia's Hospital Sleep Clinic with suspected OSA and an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) > 15 events/h. Patients were randomized to either CPAP or no therapy for 4 weeks followed by a washout of 4 weeks, and then a crossover to the other intervention. Fasting morning blood and urine, 24-h blood pressure (BP) measurements, and endothelial function (peak flow-mediated dilation to nitroglycerin-mediated dilation ratio) were assessed before and after each study intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Nine adult male and four female patients were studied. Mean (SD) age was 55 (7) years, mean AHI = 27.9/h, mean Epworth Sleepiness Score = 6.8 (11/13 had a score < 10), and mean BMI = 31.1 kg/m(2). Mean compliance with CPAP therapy was 5.53 h/night. Compared to no therapy, potential improvements were observed with CPAP for urinary microalbumin, norepinephrine, and epinephrine to creatinine ratios (decreased by 3.51 mg/mmol, 1.70 nmol/mmol, and 0.95 nmol/mmol, respectively); 24-h BP (systolic decreased by 3.60 mmHg, diastolic by 0.70 mmHg); homeostasis model for insulin resistance score (decreased by 1.11); and endothelial function (increased by 7.4%). However, none of the above differences was significant (p > 0.10).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this pilot study there were potential improvements in a variety of cardiovascular biomarkers with CPAP. CPAP compliance was reasonably good even though patients were not particularly sleepy. Accordingly, larger randomized controlled trials in this area appear feasible and warranted."

            "abstract": "Positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy is the most commonly used medical modality to reverse the apneas, hypopneas and inspiratory flow-limited breaths which result in the oxyhemoglobin desaturation, altered sleep architecture, and daytime sleepiness representing the cardinal features of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSA/H). Identifying optimal strategies to develop the initial positive airway prescription is of paramount importance to clinicians who evaluate patients with suspected OSA/H. In addition, with the growing appreciation of the clinical and physiologic importance of sleep-disordered breathing, there have been increasing demands on clinical resources to diagnose and treat these patients. The time, hardware, and personnel-intensive nature of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG) are significant in light of the traditional paradigm that utilizes a full night PSG for a diagnostic evaluation and when indicated, another full night for PAP titration. Efforts to identify time and resource-conserving alternatives to this paradigm have focused on in-laboratory split-night studies, in which the diagnosis of OSA/H can be made, and a positive pressure prescription defined during a single overnight PSG. Case-control studies indicate that, when certain guidelines are applied, split-night PSGs result in prescription efficacy and patient adherence, which are comparable to the traditional two-night strategy. However, prospective, randomized trials designed with adequate power are required to further define the impact of a split-night strategy on clinical outcome. As more information becomes available regarding the factors that determine long-term adherence to positive pressure therapy, the potential for efficient, expeditious treatment, and cost savings with split-night sleep studies will likely receive greater attention."

A study was undertaken to evaluate the hypothesis that altitude would aggravate their hypoxaemia, sleep-related breathing disturbances and impair daytime performance. METHODS Thirty-four patients with OSA of median age 62 years (IQR 57-65), median apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) 47.5 events/h (IQR 32.4-72.8), residing at <600 m were enrolled. A crossover trial randomised for the sequence of altitude exposure was carried out: patients spent 1 day in Zurich (490 m) and 4 days in the Swiss Alps at 1860 m and 2590 m (2 days each) during which continuous positive airway pressure was discontinued. Daily evaluations included polysomnography, symptom questionnaires, physical examination and driving simulator tests. RESULTS Polysomnography revealed median oxygen saturations at 490 m and in the first and second nights at 1860 and 2590 m, respectively, of 94%, 90%, 90%, 86% and 87% (p<0.01 between altitudes). Corresponding median AHI were 47.5, 85.1, 74.6, 90.0 and 90.9 events/h (p<0.01 between altitudes) with ratios of central to obstructive events of 0.1, 0.8, 1.0, 1.9 and 1.9 (p<0.01 between altitudes). Tracking performance during simulated driving was significantly impaired at 2590 m compared with 490 m. Systolic blood pressure and cardiac arrhythmias were increased at altitude. CONCLUSIONS Altitude exposure in untreated patients with OSA aggravates hypoxaemia, increases sleep-related breathing disturbances due to frequent central apnoeas/hypopnoeas, impairs driving simulator performance and induces cardiovascular stress. These findings have implications for counselling and treating patients with OSA planning to travel to high altitude. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00514826."

            "abstract": "The generally held clinical view is that treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves cognition in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the cognitive domains in which recovery is found differ between studies. A meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effect of CPAP treatment in OSA on neuropsychological functioning. A literature search of studies published from January 1990 to July 2012 was performed. The inclusion criteria were: randomized controlled trial, diagnosis of OSA by poly(somno)graphy, apnea/hypopnea index, duration and compliance of CPAP treatment reported, use of one or more standardized neuropsychological tests. Mean weighted effect sizes of CPAP treatment for seven cognitive domains were calculated, including processing speed, attention, vigilance, working memory, memory, verbal fluency and visuoconstruction. Thirteen studies encompassing 554 OSA patients were included. A small, significant effect on attention was observed in favor of CPAP (d = 0.19). For the other cognitive domains the effect sizes did not reach significance. Improvement on measures of sleepiness was modest (d = 0.30-0.53) and comparable to prior research. In conclusion, this meta-analysis indicates that the effect of CPAP on cognition is small and limited to attention. Contrary to the general assumption, only slight improvement of neuropsychological functioning after CPAP treatment can be expected."

In 40 non-obese OSA patients, free of a cardiovascular history, and 20 healthy volunteers, the following were evaluated: 1) LTB(4) production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) stimulated with A23187; and 2) the relationships between LTB(4) production and both OSA severity and infraclinical atherosclerosis markers. The effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on LTB(4) production was also studied. An overnight sleep study was followed by first-morning blood sampling. Isolated PMNs were stimulated with A23187 in order to induce LTB(4) production, which was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and luminal diameter were measured in subset groups of 28 OSA patients and 11 controls. LTB(4) production was increased in OSA patients compared with controls. LTB(4) levels correlated with the mean and minimal arterial oxygen saturation (S(a,O(2))). LTB(4) production correlated with luminal diameter data in patients with a mean S(a,O(2)) of < or = 94% but not with IMT. Lastly, CPAP significantly reduced LTB(4) production by 50%. Leukotriene B(4) production is increased in obstructive sleep apnoea in relation to oxygen desaturation.

As the nose is the first anatomical boundary of the upper airway, nasal obstruction may contribute to sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). A number of pathophysiological mechanisms can potentially explain the role of nasal pathology in SDB. These include the Starling resistor model, the unstable oral airway, the nasal ventilatory reflex and the role of nitric oxide (NO). Clinically, a number of case-control studies have shown that nasal obstruction is associated with snoring and mild SDB. However, there is not a linear correlation between the degree of nasal obstruction and the severity of SDB, while nasal obstruction is not the main contributing factor in the majority of patients with moderate to severe OSA. Randomised controlled studies have shown that in patients with allergic rhinitis or non-allergic rhinitis and sleep disturbance, nasal steroids could improve the subjective quality of sleep, and may be useful for patients with mild OSA, however, they are not by themselves an adequate treatment for most OSA patients. Similarly, nasal surgery may improve quality of life and snoring in a subgroup of patients with mild SDB and septal deviation, but it is not an effective treatment for OSA as such. On the other hand, in patients who do not tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) well, if upper airway evaluation demonstrates an obstructive nasal passage, nasal airway surgery can improve CPAP compliance and adherence."

Drug therapy has been proposed as an alternative to CPAP in some patients with mild to moderate sleep apnoea and could be of value in patients intolerant of CPAP.

Donepezil in patients with and without Alzheimer's disease, fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis, combinations of ondansetrone and fluoxetine and paroxetine were trials of one to three months duration, however most of the studies were small and had methodological limitations. The overall quality of the available evidence was low.The primary outcomes for the systematic review were the apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) and the level of sleepiness associated with OSA, estimated by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). AHI was reported in 25 studies and of these 10 showed statistically significant reductions in AHI.Fluticasone in patients with allergic rhinitis was well tolerated and reduced the severity of sleep apnoea compared with placebo (AHI 23.3 versus 30.3; P < 0.05) and improved subjective daytime alertness. Excessive sleepiness was reported to be altered in four studies, however the only clinically and statistically significant change in ESS of -2.9 (SD 2.9; P = 0.04) along with a small but statistically significant reduction in AHI of -9.4 (SD 17.2; P = 0.03) was seen in patients without Alzheimer's disease receiving donepezil for one month.

High dose combined treatment with ondansetron 24 mg and fluoxetine 10 mg showed a 40.5% decrease in AHI from the baseline at treatment day 28. Paroxetine was shown to reduce AHI compared to placebo (-6.10 events/hour; 95% CI -11.00 to -1.20) but failed to improve daytime symptoms.Promising results from the preliminary mirtazapine study failed to be reproduced in the two more recent multicentre trials and, moreover, the use of mirtazapine was associated with significant weight gain and sleepiness.

Certain agents have been shown to reduce the AHI in largely unselected populations with OSA by between 24% and 45%. For donepezil and fluticasone, studies of longer duration with a larger population and better matching of groups are required to establish whether the change in AHI and impact on daytime symptoms are reproducible. Individual patients had more complete responses to particular drugs. It is possible that better matching of drugs to patients according to the dominant mechanism of their OSA will lead to better results and this also needs further study."

The potential to improve endothelial function and CPC levels in people with OSA by preventing hypoxic episodes with Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) was investigated in a sham-controlled CPAP study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Men with moderate-to-severe OSA (mean ± SD: age=49 ± 12 y, apnoea hypopnea index (AHI)=37.6 ± 16.4 events/h, body mass index=31.5 ± 5.7 kg/m(2)) who were CPAP naïve without diabetes mellitus were randomised in a 12-week double-blind sham-controlled parallel group study to receive either active (n=25) or sham (n=21) CPAP. CPCs, isolated from blood, were measured by flow cytometry and by co-staining cultured cells (7 days) with acetylated low-density lipoprotein (acLDL) and lectin. Endothelial function was assessed by peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Compared to sham, CPAP significantly decreased AHI (mean between-group difference -36.0 events/h; 95%CI, -49.7 to -22.3, p<0.0001) after 12 weeks. Despite this improvement in AHI, CPAP had no effect on change in CPC levels (including CD34(+)/KDR(+) (565 cells/mL; -977 to 2106, p=0.45), CD34(+)/KDR(+)/CD45(-) (37.0 cells/mL; -17.7 to 85.7, p=0.13), acLDL(+)/lectin(+) (-43.1 cells/field, -247 to 161, p=0.67)) or change in endothelial function (0.27; -0.14 to 0.67, p=0.19) compared to sham therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Despite the improvement in OSA parameters and ablation of apnoeic events by CPAP, CPC counts and endothelial function in men with moderate-to-severe OSA were not significantly improved after 12 weeks of therapeutic CPAP when compared to sham control."

            "abstract": "This study examined the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on blood pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Thirty-nine patients with sleep apnea were studied. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring was obtained before and after patients were randomized to receive either 1 week of CPAP or placebo CPAP (CPAP administered at ineffective pressure). Blood pressure was examined over daytime hours (6 AM to 10 PM) and during nighttime hours (10 PM to 6 AM). Daytime mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly but equally in both the active treatment group and the placebo treatment group (P=0.001). Nighttime mean arterial pressure levels decreased to a much greater extent over time in the patients who received active CPAP treatment (P=0. 032). CPAP does appear to decrease nighttime blood pressure. However, the decrease in daytime blood pressure may reflect a nonspecific response (ie, placebo), since both the active treatment group and the placebo treatment group developed comparable decreases in blood pressure."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in infants has been shown to resolve frequently without a cortical arousal. It is unknown whether infants do not require arousal to terminate apneas or whether this is a consequence of the OSA. We studied the apnea and arousal patterns of eight infants with OSA before and after treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). These infants were age matched to eight untreated infants with OSA and eight normal infants. Polysomnographic studies were performed on each infant. We found that the majority of central and obstructive apneas were terminated without arousal in all OSA infants. After several weeks of nasal CPAP treatment, the proportion of apneas terminating with an arousal during rapid-eye-movement sleep increased in treated infants compared with untreated infants. Spontaneous arousals during rapid-eye-movement sleep were reduced in all OSA infants; however, during CPAP treatment, the spontaneous arousals increased to the normal control level. We conclude that OSA in infants possibly depresses the arousal response and treatment of these infants with nasal CPAP partially reverses this depression."

            "abstract": "Normal children have a smaller upper airway than adults, but, nevertheless, snore less and have less apnea. We have previously shown that normal children have an upper airway that is resistant to collapse during sleep. We hypothesized that this resistance to collapse is due to preservation of upper airway neuromotor responses during sleep. Furthermore, we hypothesized that upper airway responses would be diminished in children with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We therefore compared the upper airway pressure-flow relationship during sleep between children with OSAS and controls. Measurements were made by correlating maximal inspiratory airflow with the level of nasal pressure applied via a mask. Neuromotor upper airway activation was assessed by evaluating the upper airway response to 1) hypercapnia and 2) intermittent, acute negative pressure. We found that children with OSAS had no significant response to either hypercapnia or negative pressure during sleep, compared with the normal children. After treatment of OSAS by tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, there was a trend for normalization of upper airway responses. We conclude that upper airway dynamic responses are decreased in children with OSAS but recover after treatment. We speculate that the pharyngeal airway neuromotor responses present in normal children are a compensatory response for a relatively narrow upper airway. Further, we speculate that this compensatory response is lacking in children with OSAS, most likely due to either habituation to chronic respiratory abnormalities during sleep or to mechanical damage to the upper airway."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and hypertension commonly coexist. Observational studies indicate that untreated OSA is strongly associated with an increased risk of prevalent hypertension, whereas prospective studies of normotensive cohorts suggest that OSA may increase the risk of incident hypertension. Randomized evaluations of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) indicate an overall modest effect on blood pressure (BP). Determining why OSA is so strongly linked to having hypertension in cross-sectional studies, but yet CPAP therapy has limited BP benefit needs further exploration. The CPAP studies do, however, indicate a wide variation in the BP effects of CPAP, with some patients manifesting a large antihypertensive benefit such that a meaningful BP effect can be anticipated in some individuals. OSA is particularly common in patients with resistant hypertension (RHTN). The reason for this high prevalence of OSA is not fully explained, but data suggest that it may be related to the high occurrence of hyperaldosteronism in patients with RHTN. In patients with RHTN, it has been shown that aldosterone levels correlate with severity of OSA and that blockade of aldosterone reduces the severity of OSA. Overall, these findings are consistent with aldosterone excess contributing to worsening of underlying OSA. We hypothesize that aldosterone excess worsens OSA by promoting accumulation of fluid within the neck, which then contributes to increased upper airway resistance."

The mechanisms leading to this difference are currently unclear but could include gender differences in respiratory stability [loop gain (LG)] or upper airway collapsibility [pharyngeal critical closing pressure (Pcrit)]. The aim of this study was to compare LG and Pcrit between men and women with OSA to determine whether the factors contributing to apnea are similar between genders. The first group of 11 men and 11 women were matched for OSA severity (mean +/- SE apnea-hypopnea index = 43.8 +/- 6.1 and 44.1 +/- 6.6 events/h). The second group of 12 men and 12 women were matched for body mass index (BMI; 31.6 +/- 1.9 and 31.3 +/- 1.8 kg/m2, respectively). All measurements were made during stable supine non-rapid eye movement sleep. LG was determined using a proportional assist ventilator. Pcrit was measured by progressively dropping the continuous positive airway pressure level for three to five breaths until airway collapse. Apnea-hypopnea index-matched women had a higher BMI than men (38.0 +/- 2.4 vs. 30.0 +/- 1.9 kg/m2; P = 0.03), but LG and Pcrit were similar between men and women (LG: 0.37 +/- 0.02 and 0.37 +/- 0.02, respectively, P = 0.92; Pcrit: 0.35 +/- 0.62 and -0.18 +/- 0.87, respectively, P = 0.63). In the BMI-matched subgroup, women had less severe OSA during non-rapid eye movement sleep (30.9 +/- 7.4 vs. 52.5 +/- 8.1 events/h; P = 0.04) and lower Pcrit (-2.01 +/- 0.62 vs. 1.16 +/- 0.83 cmH2O; P = 0.005). However, LG was not significantly different between genders (0.38 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.03; P = 0.14).

            "abstract": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration occurs during sleep in 40-45% of patients with NYHA class III and IV heart failure. Such patients experience repeated episodes of progressively diminishing ventilation associated with desaturation followed by periods of increasing-amplitude ventilation. The mechanism appears to be related to hyperventilation leading to hypocapnia which occurs near a critical threshold of apnea during sleep stages I and stage II and interrupts central ventilatory control. The total duration of the periodic respiration cycle would depend on the increased circulation time subsequent to lowered cardiac output. Brief periods of waking provoked by Cheyne-Stokes respiration, accentuating sympathetic nervous system activity, are an unfavorable prognostic factor in heart failure. Activation of the sympathetic system may be corrected by CPAP although the long-term effect on heart failure remains controversial. Other treatments, such as oxygen therapy or theophylline, combined with optimized treatment of heart failure, have been proposed."

The fall and rise of arterial oxygenation that follows each apnoea may increase lipid peroxidation and contributes to explaining this association. In the present study, the authors determined lipid peroxidation in patients with OSAS and the effect of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Fourteen male patients with severe OSAS (59+/-5 apnoea x h(-1)) (+/-SEM) and 13 healthy nonsmoking, male volunteers of similar age were studied. Patients were studied at diagnosis and after treatment with CPAP for more than 1 yr (>4 h x night(-1)). A venous blood sample was obtained early in the morning after fasting all night. In patients with OSAS, a sample before and during sleep was also obtained. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Their level of oxidation was determined by the thiobarbituric acid assay (TBARs), and their susceptibility to oxidation by the lag phase measurement. Patients with OSAS showed higher TBARs (28.1+/-2.8 versus 20.0+/-1.8 nmol x malondialdehyde x mgLDL protein(-1), p=0.02) and shorter lag phase values (83.8+/-3.4 versus 99.7+/-3.4 min, p=0.005) than controls. These differences were not due to the smoking status of the patient. Likewise, these values did not change significantly throughout the night yet, the lag phase value was significantly improved by treatment with CPAP (124.9+/-8.5 min; p<0.001). These results indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is associated with abnormal lipid peroxidation and that this is improved by chronic use of Continuous positive airway pressure.

The most accurate test of aerobic fitness is measurement of maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) with cycle ergometry.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a retrospective cohort analysis (247 patients with OSA) of VO2max from annual cycle ergometry tests compared to a large control group (normative data from 1.4 million US Air Force tests) in a tertiary care setting.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall, individuals with OSA had increased VO2max when compared to the normalized US Air Force data (p < .001). Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 demonstrated a decreased VO2max as compared to normalized values (p < .001). No differences in VO2max were observed after either medical or surgical therapy for OSA.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, in a US Air Force population, OSA does not predict a decrease in aerobic fitness as measured by cycle ergometry. However, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index of greater than 20 have a statistically significant decrease in aerobic fitness compared to the normal population. This study demonstrates the effects of OSA on aerobic fitness. Further correlation of fitness testing results with OSA severity and treatment is needed."

The underlying mechanisms, however, are not entirely understood. This study investigated the influence of mild-to-moderate OSA and its treatment on renal haemodynamics as assessed by the renal resistance index (RRI).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      RRI has been measured by colour duplex ultrasound in 64 patients with newly diagnosed mild-to-moderate OSA and 61 controls without OSA at baseline and follow-up after 9.9 months.

The corresponding mean RRI was 70.50 ± 9.01 vs 66.51 ± 8.33 (P = 0.012). In multivariate analyses, the influence of OSA on RRI was independent from hypertension, diabetes mellitus, age and baseline renal function.

These changes of renal blood flow may identify OSA patients at high risk of declining renal function. Both parenchymal and vascular renal diseases are proposed as pathomechanisms for this association. An effective treatment of OSA resulted in a decreased RRI, suggesting an improvement in renal perfusion. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of impaired renal haemodynamics in OSA."

            "abstract": "The prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome is relatively high in population (5%). The mortality is significantly higher in those with apnea-hypopnea index >20. There is an increased rate of car accidents in the subjects with OSA compared to those who don't have this syndrome (31% versus 6%). The impact of OSA on mortality is also given by its association with a significant number of cardiovascular diseases. The association between OSA and hypertension has been much debated. The prevalence of hypertension among patients with OSA varies between 50-58%, while the prevalence of OSA in hypertensive patients is 30%. A particular association is OSA and resistant hypertension, i.e. blood pressure that remains above goal in spite of the concurrent use of three antihypertensive agents of different classes, one to be a diuretic and all pharmacological agents being prescribed at recommended doses. Secondary causes of hypertension are common in patients with resistant hypertension. Among these causes, one of the most frequent is sleep apnea syndrome. Some of the mechanisms by which sleep apnea contributes to the development of hypertension are intermittent hypoxia and/or increased upper airway resistance associated with sleep apnea that induces a sustained increase in sympathetic nervous system activity. Treatment of sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure devices (CPAP) improves blood pressure control, although the benefit of CPAP evaluated in clinical trials is variable."

            "abstract": "Between 1982 and 2006, there were 89 distinct publications dealing with oral appliance therapy involving a total of 3,027 patients, which reported results of sleep studies performed with and without the appliance. These studies, which constitute a very heterogeneous group in terms of methodology and patient population, are reviewed and the results summarized. This review focused on the following outcomes: sleep apnea (i.e. reduction in the apnea/hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index), ability of oral appliances to reduce snoring, effect of oral appliances on daytime function, comparison of oral appliances with other treatments (continuous positive airway pressure and surgery), side effects, dental changes (overbite and overjet), and long-term compliance. We found that the success rate, defined as the ability of the oral appliances to reduce apnea/hypopnea index to less than 10, is 54%. The response rate, defined as at least 50% reduction in the initial apnea/hypopnea index (although it still remained above 10), is 21%. When only the results of randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled studies are considered, the success and response rates are 50% and 14%, respectively. Snoring was reduced by 45%. In the studies comparing oral appliances to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), an appliance reduced initial AHI by 42%, CPAP reduced it by 75%, and UPPP by 30%. The majority of patients prefer using oral appliance than CPAP. Use of oral appliances improves daytime function somewhat; the Epworth sleepiness score (ESS) dropped from 11.2 to 7.8 in 854 patients. A summary of the follow-up compliance data shows that at 30 months, 56-68% of patients continue to use oral appliance. Side effects are relatively minor but frequent. The most common ones are excessive salivation and teeth discomfort. Efficacy and side effects depend on the type of appliance, degree of protrusion, vertical opening, and other settings. We conclude that oral appliances, although not as effective as CPAP in reducing sleep apnea, snoring, and improving daytime function, have a definite role in the treatment of snoring and sleep apnea."

In addition to associated cardiovascular comorbidities, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome has been linked to poor quality of life, occupational accidents, and motor vehicle crashes secondary to excessive daytime sleepiness. Although continuous positive airway pressure is the gold standard for sleep apnea treatment, its effects on quality of life are not well defined. In the current study we investigated the effects of treatment on quality of life using the data from the Apnea Positive Pressure Long-term Efficacy Study (APPLES), a randomized controlled trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) versus sham CPAP. The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality of Life Index (SAQLI) was used to assess quality of life. Overall we found no significant improvement in quality of life among sleep apnea patients after CPAP treatment. However, after stratifying by OSA severity, it was found that long-term improvement in quality of life might occur with the use of CPAP in people with severe and possibly moderate sleep apnea, and no demonstrable improvement in quality of life was noted among participants with mild obstructive sleep apnea."

In early 1981, we began a home treatment trial of nasal CPAP. Patients were treated in hospital for 3 to 5 nights, a period in which they were trained to fit the custom made nose-mask used to provide nasal CPAP. Patients subsequently continued treatment at home. Daytime somnolence resolved within days of starting therapy, and did not recur while the nasal CPAP unit was used on a regular basis. At present, we have 35 patients who have been on therapy for periods ranging between 3 and 30 months. Although each patient has displayed a reduction of severity of the underlying sleep apnoea when tested without nasal CPAP, the majority continue to require regular nightly nasal CPAP. In a few patients, treatment with nasal CPAP appeared to help in weight control such that obstructive apnoea and snoring have resolved. Nasal CPAP is a safe, fully effective therapy for obstructive apnoea, and can be used indefinitely by the patient at home."

After baseline recordings patients were submitted to 25 min. of CPAP and BiPAP breathing in random order. The pressure of 10 cm H20 for CPAP and 10/4 cm H20 for BiPAP was used. At baseline pulmonary arterial pressures and flow were normal. CPAP breathing resulted in an increase in mean pulmonary intravascular pressure from 15.5 +/- 1.8 mmHg to 17.1 +/- 2.3 mmHg (p < 0.05). Transmural pressure did not change. There was also no change in the cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). At some time points pulmonary arterial pressures were higher during CPAP breathing than during BiPAP breathing (p < 0.01).

Treating obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) reduces arousal frequency indicating that such arousals are caused by OSA. In heart failure (HF) patients with central sleep apnea (CSA), however, arousals frequently occur several breaths after apnea termination, and there is uncertainty as to whether arousals from sleep are a consequence of CSA. If so, they should diminish in frequency when CSA is attenuated.

            "abstract": "Sleep apnea is evident in approximately 10% of adults in the general population, but in certain cardiovascular diseases, and in particular those characterized by sodium and water retention, its prevalence can exceed 50%. Although sleep apnea is not as yet integrated into formal cardiovascular risk assessment algorithms, there is increasing awareness of its importance in the causation or promotion of hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial arrhythmias, and stroke, and thus, not surprisingly, as a predictor of premature cardiovascular death. Sleep apnea manifests as two principal phenotypes, both characterized by respiratory instability: obstructive (OSA), which arises when sleep-related withdrawal of respiratory drive to the upper airway dilator muscles is superimposed upon a narrow and highly compliant airway predisposed to collapse, and central (CSA), which occurs when the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide falls below the apnea threshold, resulting in withdrawal of central drive to respiratory muscles. The present objectives are to: (1) review the epidemiology and patho-physiology of OSA and CSA, with particular emphasis on the role of renal sodium retention in initiating and promoting these processes, and on population studies that reveal the long-term consequences of untreated OSA and CSA; (2) illustrate mechanical, autonomic, chemical, and inflammatory mechanisms by which OSA and CSA can increase cardiovascular risk and event rates by initiating or promoting hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke; (3) highlight insights from randomized trials in which treating sleep apnea was the specific target of therapy; (4) emphasize the present lack of evidence that treating sleep apnea reduces cardiovascular risk and the current clinical equipoise concerning treatment of asymptomatic patients with sleep apnea; and (5) consider clinical implications and future directions of clinical research and practice."

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment for OSAH , but many patients are unable or unwilling to comply with this treatment. Oral appliances (OA) are an alternative treatment for OSAH.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective was to review the effects of OA in the treatment of OSAH in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register.

Study authors were contacted for missing information.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Sixteen studies (745 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All the studies had some shortcomings, such as small sample size, under-reporting of methods and data, and lack of blinding. OA versus control appliances (six studies): OA reduced daytime sleepiness in two crossover trials (WMD -1.81;95%CI -2.72 to -0.90), and improved apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) (-10.78; 95% CI-15.53 to -6.03 parallel group data - five studies). OA versus CPAP (nine studies): OA were less effective than CPAP in reducing apnoea-hypopnoea index (parallel group studies: WMD 13 (95% CI 7.63 to 18.36), two trials; crossover studies: WMD 7.97; (95% CI 6.38 to 9.56, seven trials). However, no significant difference was observed on symptom scores. CPAP was more effective at improving minimum arterial oxygen saturation during sleep compared with OA. In two small crossover studies, participants preferred OA therapy to CPAP. OA versus corrective upper airway surgery (one study): Symptoms of daytime sleepiness were initially lower with surgery, but this difference disappeared at 12 months. AHI did not differ significantly initially, but did so after 12 months in favour of OA.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is increasing evidence suggesting that OA improves subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing compared with a control. CPAP appears to be more effective in improving sleep disordered breathing than OA. The difference in symptomatic response between these two treatments is not significant, although it is not possible to exclude an effect in favour of either therapy. Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of OA in relation to CPAP, with regard to symptoms and long-term complications, it would appear to be appropriate to recommend OA therapy to patients with mild symptomatic OSAH, and those patients who are unwilling or unable to tolerate CPAP therapy. Future research should recruit patients with more severe symptoms of sleepiness, to establish whether the response to therapy differs between subgroups in terms of quality of life, symptoms and persistence with usage. Long-term data on cardiovascular health are required."

            "abstract": "Automatic positive airway pressure devices are the most technologically advanced positive airway pressure devices available for use in OSA. Although heterogeneous, they have in common the ability to detect and respond to changes in upper airway resistance. Data cannot necessarily be extrapolated from one device to another, and the field is rapidly advancing. Most studies of APAP have been performed in a supervised setting, or patients have been carefully selected to have a high likelihood of OSA uncomplicated by disorders such as alveolar hypoventilation or central apnea or technical problems such as mask leaks. Studies of APAP for the diagnosis of OSA have shown that APAP can diagnose severe OSA effectively, but the diagnosis of mild-moderate OSA is less reliable. APAP devices also can be effective therapy for selected patients with OSA, with overall similar results to conventional fixed CPAP in terms of respiratory disturbances, sleep quality, nocturnal oxygenation, and daytime sleepiness and performance, with less known or other long-term outcomes. In most studies, mean treatment pressures are lower, without change in side effect profile. Compliance and preference with APAP are similar to or somewhat better than CPAP in most studies. APAP also can be used in an attended setting to titrate an effective pressure for use in long-term conventional CPAP therapy, also with similar results to CPAP in many patients. APAP devices are more expensive than CPAP devices, but the cost may be outweighed if a group of patients who can be diagnosed, treated, or titrated safely in the unattended setting can be identified. Although diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for APAP have been proposed, the best candidates for this modality must be defined better."

OSAS is associated with a number of adverse health consequences, and a growing literature focuses on its cognitive correlates. Although research in this field is mixed, multiple studies indicate that OSAS patients show impairment in attention, memory, and executive function. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most effective and widely used treatment of OSAS, and supplemental medications may supplement CPAP treatment to ameliorate associated symptoms. Here, we review the literature on OSAS and cognition, including studies that have investigated the impact of CPAP and stimulant medication on cognitive performance in patients with OSAS. In general, no consistent effect of CPAP use on cognitive performance was evident. This may be due, in part, to variability in study design and sampling methodology across studies. Studies of stimulant medications generally reported positive effects on cognitive performance. We conclude with a discussion of the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain cognitive dysfunction in OSAS and directions for future research."

            "abstract": "The upper airway is often modeled as a classical Starling resistor, featuring a constant inspiratory airflow, or plateau, over a range of downstream pressures. However, airflow tracings from clinical sleep studies often show an initial peak before the plateau. To conform to the Starling model, the initial peak must be of small magnitude or dismissed as a transient. We developed a method to simulate fast or slow inspirations through the human upper airway, to test the hypothesis that this initial peak is a transient. Eight subjects [4 obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 4 controls] slept in an \"iron lung\" and wore a nasal mask connected to a continuous/bilevel positive airway pressure machine. Downstream pressure was measured using an epiglottic catheter. During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, subjects were hyperventilated to produce a central apnea, then extrathoracic pressure was decreased slowly (∼2-4 s) or abruptly (<0.5 s) to lower downstream pressure and create inspiratory airflow. Pressure-flow curves were constructed for flow-limited breaths, and slow vs. fast reductions in downstream pressure were compared. All subjects exhibited an initial peak and then a decrease in flow with more negative pressures, demonstrating negative effort dependence (NED). The rate of change in downstream pressure did not affect the peak to plateau airflow ratio: %NED 22 ± 13% (slow) vs. 20 ± 5% (fast), P = not significant. We conclude that the initial peak in inspiratory airflow is not a transient but rather a distinct mechanical property of the upper airway. In contrast to the classical Starling resistor model, the upper airway exhibits marked NED in some subjects."

Both its forms - central and obstructive sleep apnea - are highly prevalent in this population. SDB fragments sleep, impairs life quality, worsens exercise tolerance, worsens HF and is an independent predictor of poor prognosis. Still, SDB remains largely undiagnosed. Therefore, early detection of SDB seems to be of primary importance, especially in the presence of new diagnostic and therapeutic methods. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) increases left ventricular ejection fraction and stroke volume in virtually all HF patients with obstructive and in 50% with central sleep apnea. For those in whom central sleep apnea is not suppressed by CPAP, a trial of adaptive servoventilation is recommended. Although no randomized, controlled trials have shown improvement in mortality, several observational studies have shown that effective treatment of both forms of sleep apnea with various positive airway pressure devices improves survival of HF patients. Currently, 2 large trials with newer masked based therapies with adaptive servoventilation are in progress.

The syndrome is particularly prevalent in middle-aged and older adults. The mechanism by which the upper airway collapses is not fully understood but is multifactorial and includes obesity, craniofacial changes, alteration in upper airway muscle function, pharyngeal neuropathy and fluid shift towards the neck. The direct consequences of the collapse are intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia, recurrent arousals and increase in respiratory efforts, leading to secondary sympathetic activation, oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. Excessive daytime sleepiness is a burden for the majority of patients. OSAS is also associated with cardiovascular co-morbidities, including hypertension, arrhythmias, stroke, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis and overall increased cardiovascular mortality, as well as metabolic dysfunction. Whether treating sleep apnoea can fully reverse its chronic consequences remains to be established in adequately designed studies. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary treatment modality in patients with severe OSAS, whereas oral appliances are also widely used in mild to moderate forms. Finally, combining different treatment modalities such as CPAP and weight control is beneficial, but need to be evaluated in randomized controlled trials.

Oral masks use a mouthpiece that may stabilize the jaw and the tongue and have shown to be effective. However, oral masks are not widely used in clinical practice. Four out of five observational studies and all five reviewed randomized studies showed a worse performance of oronasal when compared with nasal masks.

Treating CSR-CSA may, therefore, improve outcomes in patients with CHF.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Trial for Congestive Heart Failure Patients with Central Sleep Apnea (CANPAP) is a multicentre, randomized, controlled clinical trial designed to test the hypothesis that treating CSR-CSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) will reduce the combined rate of all-cause mortality and cardiac transplantation in patients with CHF. Secondary outcomes include the severity of CSR-CSA, left ventricular volumes and function, submaximal exercise capacity, quality of life and hospital admissions.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      The aim is to enroll 408 patients with CHF (New York Heart Association class II to IV and left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40%) and CSR-CSA over a five-year period. Patients are randomly assigned to either standard medical therapy for CHF or standard medical therapy plus CPAP. The trial has 80% power to detect a 35% between-group treatment difference for the all-cause mortality-cardiac transplantation rate. Substudies will assess the role of oximetry as a screening tool for detecting CSR-CSA in patients with CHF, and the effects of CPAP on cardiac arrhythmias and plasma concentrations of natriuretic peptides and catecholamines.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The CANPAP trial will help to define the role of CPAP better as a nonpharmacological intervention for the treatment of patients with CHF who have CSR-CSA."

Snoring was simulated by a loudspeaker connected to the lung model and abruptly activated during 1 s of each inspiratory period to induce pressure oscillation. The oscillation frequencies chosen were 30, 60, 90, and 120 Hz. For each frequency, the amplitude of the pressure oscillation produced by the loudspeaker was adjusted to find the threshold at which the auto-nCPAP devices detected snoring. Differences in pressure-amplitude thresholds of up to three-fold were found across auto-nCPAP devices. A randomized clinical study to compare the effects of the least sensitive (Virtuoso LX; Respironics, Nantes, France) and one of the most sensitive, (Goodknight 418A; Malinckrodt, Nancy, France) devices, in two groups of six patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome was then conducted.

In 7 OSAS patients (apnea-hypopnea index, 51.0 +/- 23.4) and 7 non-snorers as control, nocturnal urine was sampled and analyzed for stable metabolites of prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TxA2), [6-keto-PGF1alpha and thromboxane B2 (TxB2)]. The ratio of 6-keto-PGF1alpha to TxB2 was significantly higher in OSAS (2.97 +/- 1.52) than in control (1.38 +/- 0.38). Successful treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (8.3 +/- 1.5 cmH2O) for 3 days caused a significant decrease in mean blood pressure in OSAS. Moreover, the 6-keto-PGF1alpha to TxB2 ratio also significantly decreased to 1.74 +/- 0.58, a level which may not significantly different from control. These results suggest that the production ratio of PGI2 to TxA2 is shifted toward vasodilatation in untreated OSAS.

            "abstract": "Proportional positive airway pressure (PPAP) was designed to optimize airway pressure for the therapy of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). In a randomized crossover prospective study, the clinical feasibility of PPAP and its immediate effects on the breathing disorder and sleep in comparison with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was evaluated. Twelve patients requiring CPAP therapy underwent CPAP and PPAP titration in a random order. Obstructive and mixed respiratory events could be completely abolished with both forms of treatment. This efficacy could be achieved at a significantly lower mean mask pressure during PPAP titration (8.45+/-2.42 cmH2O) compared to CPAP (9.96+/-2.7 cmH2O) (p=0.002). The mean minimal arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) (82.8+/-6.5%) on the diagnostic night increased significantly (p<0.001) to an average Sa,O2 of 93.35+/-1.71% and 93.19+/-2.9% during CPAP and PPAP titration. Total sleep time, slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased significantly by the same amount during both CPAP and PPAP titration (p<0.001), while sleep stage nonrapid eye movement (NREM) 1 and 2 decreased. Six patients preferred the PPAP titration night, four patients did not have a preference, and two patients preferred CPAP. The present data show that proportional positive airway pressure is as effective as continuous positive airway pressure in eliminating obstructive events and has the same immediate effect on sleep. The lower average mask pressure during proportional positive airway pressure implies potential advantages compared to continuous positive airway pressure. Proportional positive airway pressure presents a new effective therapeutic approach to obstructive sleep apnoea."

The present study aimed to assess the effect of heated humidification of nCPAP on upper airway symptoms and initial use in obstructive sleep apnoea. This study was of a randomised, crossover design. Subjects with polysomnographically confirmed OSAS were randomised to 3 weeks nCPAP treatment with heated humidification (nCPAP-humid) or placebo humidification (nCPAP pl-humid).

Thirty seven of 42 patients completed the protocol. nCPAP-humid reduced the frequency of adverse upper airway symptoms. nCPAP use over 3 weeks was greater with nCPAP-humid compared with nCPAP pl-humid. No difference was found between the treatment arms in terms of subjective treatment satisfaction or alertness. Heated humidification of nasal continuous positive airway pressure reduces upper airway symptoms and is associated with a small increase in initial use but not subjective sleepiness or treatment satisfaction. The results support the use of heated humidification as a strategy to reduce side-effects related to continuous positive airway pressure but not routine initial use."

Most of the complaints, however, were comparatively minor. The most frequent complaint was a tendency to nasal regurgitation (13%), although only two patients needed treatment. Other complaints were pharyngeal hypersecretion (10%), swallowing problems (9%) and speech disturbances (7%). Fourteen per cent of the 69 patients were not satisfied with the effect of the operation. In the group with complaints, 25% were dissatisfied with the result of the operation, whereas only 8% of those with no complaints were dissatisfied (p < 0.05). Continued snoring after UPPP was closely correlated to dissatisfaction with the general result (p < 0.01). It is very important to carry out follow-up after UPPP because complaints and dissatisfaction are common. Every effort should be made to reduce the tendency to nasal regurgitation. The results are relatively good and the procedure justified in cases of severe snoring and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-resistant obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The severity and number of complaints were found to be acceptable in this difficult treatable entity."

Fourteen subjects presenting with mild-moderate OSA, (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] 10 to 60/h), were included in a randomized crossover investigation. A shoulder-head elevation pillow (SHEP) was compared with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy. Treatment success was defined as AHI<or=10/h and partial success as AHI>10<16/h. Four subjects achieved treatment success with the SHEP and three achieved partial success. The remaining seven subjects were treatment failures. In contrast, success was achieved with nCPAP in 12 subjects. One subject achieved partial success and one was a treatment failure. With the SHEP, the mean AHI decreased from 27+/-12/h to 21+/-17/h. With nCPAP, the mean AHI was 5+/-3/h; (p=0.008 for the difference between treatments). Although somewhat variable, these data provide evidence that elevated posture during sleep is helpful in the management of OSA in some individuals. Results support the use of elevated posture as second-line therapy in the management of OSA. However, no relationships could be identified between baseline data, including the identification of positional OSA, and objective outcomes that might predict patients who are likely to benefit from treatment in an elevated position."

            "abstract": "Though continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for the sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (SAHS), suboptimal adherence to CPAP is common. Internationally, some 5-50% of SAHS patients recommended for CPAP either reject this treatment option or discontinue within the first week, and 12-25% of remaining patients can be expected to have discontinued CPAP by 3 years. Biomedical investigations of patients' CPAP use reveal frequent adverse effects, weak prospective relationships between symptomatic or physiological disease severity and CPAP use, and moderate correlations between use and benefit. Relatively expensive high-technological interventions to improve CPAP use (e.g. \"intelligent\" CPAP, humidification) are the subject of several well-conducted studies favouring their effectiveness. More basic educational and behavioural supports, and low-technological interventions (e.g. chinstraps, mask re-fitting) appear valued, but are currently less rigorously evaluated. In other diseases with demanding treatment regimens, cognitive constructs including health attitudes and beliefs (health value, locus of control, chance, powerful others, self-efficacy) and mental and physical health status are significant predictors of adherence. The enhancement of multidisciplinary models with psychosocial interpretations may provide increased explanatory and interventional potential in models of CPAP use. While acknowledging the scarcity of evidence, a structured, multidisciplinary, cost-efficient model is suggested, containing educational, behavioural and technological components as basic support, and with high-expertise cognitive-behavioural intervention in more difficult cases of low CPAP use."

Group A: home respiratory polygraphy (RP) and home follow-up; group B: hospital polysomnography and hospital follow-up; and group C: home RP and hospital follow-up. Evaluation during 6 months included Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and daily activity and symptom questionnaires. Compliance was assessed by memory cards (group A) and using an hourly counter (groups B and C). 66 patients were included (22 per branch), 83% were males, aged mean±sd 52±10 yrs, body mass index 34±7kg·m(-2), apnoea/hypopnoea index 43±20 h(-1), CPAP pressure 8±2 cmH(2)O, with no between-group differences. Clinical response showed an ESS of mean±sd 15±3 to 6±4, a FOSQ of 16±3 to 18±2, symptoms of 43±7 to 25±7, and activity of 37±11 to 25±8.

Because there are no controlled studies showing a substantial effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy on hypertension in OSA, the impact of treatment on cardiovascular sequelae has been questioned altogether. Therefore, we studied the effect of nCPAP on arterial hypertension in patients with OSA.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Sixty consecutive patients with moderate to severe OSA were randomly assigned to either effective or subtherapeutic nCPAP for 9 weeks on average. Nocturnal polysomnography and continuous noninvasive blood pressure recording for 19 hours was performed before and with treatment. Thirty two patients, 16 in each group, completed the study. Apneas and hypopneas were reduced by approximately 95% and 50% in the therapeutic and subtherapeutic groups, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure decreased by 9.9+/-11.4 mm Hg with effective nCPAP treatment, whereas no relevant change occurred with subtherapeutic nCPAP (P=0.01).

The fact that a 50% reduction in the apnea-hypopnea index did not result in a decrease in blood pressure emphasizes the importance of highly effective treatment. The drop in mean blood pressure by 10 mm Hg would be predicted to reduce coronary heart disease event risk by 37% and stroke risk by 56%."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when airflow ceases because of pharyngeal wall collapse in sleep. Repeated apneic events results in the development of a pathological condition called OSA syndrome. We describe the methodology and design of a prosthetic device, named automatic positive airway pressure (APAP), for treatment of this syndrome. APAP applies a stream of air via a nasal mask at an initial pressure selected by the patient. By sensing specific pressure characteristics of air flow immediately preceding pharyngeal wall collapse, the APAP device automatically raises the applied pressure to maintain a patent upper airway and thus prevent apnea. Conversely, when such conditions are absent, pressure is lowered step wise until a preselected minimum pressure is reached. Performance evaluation of the APAP system in five OSA patients and five normal (asymptomatic for sleep apnea) subjects revealed that it effectively treated OSA syndrome. It lowered the apnea-hypopnea index without disturbing sleep and resulted in a lower mean airway pressure compared to the traditional continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. The results also show that the pressure needed to prevent OSA varied significantly throughout the night. For OSA syndrome patients, this pressure ranged from 3 to 18 cm H2O. The mean airway pressure for these patients had a sample average of 6.80 cm H2O and a standard deviation of 3.17 cm H2O. In normal subjects, the device did not raise pressure except in response to Pharyngeal Wall Vibration events."

This study was undertaken to identify serum proteins associated with OSA by using a proteomics technique and to examine changes in identified protein levels after continuous positive airway pressure treatment. The study participants consisted of 40 male patients (aged 40-49 years) with severe OSA and 34 male control subjects matched for age and body mass index. All subjects underwent polysomnography. Using a proteomics approach, we identified nine proteins that were differentially expressed in patients with severe OSA and controls. Three of these nine proteins, haptoglobin, paraoxonase-1 and apolipoprotein M, were quantified by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, kinetic assays and by using Western blotting. Multiple regression analysis showed that haptoglobin and apolipoprotein M levels are independently related to apnoea-hypopnoea index (P < 0.01).

Polysomnographic studies are the gold standard for assessing the effects of treatments on nocturnal breathing the sleep characteristics, but the timing of control sleep studies must take into account the possible changes in treatment efficacy with time. Determining the effective positive pressure level during split nights or with a multifactorial regression model may be helpful but can result in an underestimation of the pressure setting. The utility of unassisted home sleep recordings during CPAP therapy is limited by the number of signals recorded and the absence of sleep recording. The evaluation of neuropsychological improvements has to be multifactorial to evaluate the subjective and objective effects of SAHS treatments. The compliance to CPAP therapy must be evaluated by pressure counter or time counter measurements rather than on the reported use. CPAP observance can be reliably estimated after the first month of therapy is linked to improvement in diurnal symptoms. As for any disease, SAHS treatment must be adapted to the individual characteristics of the patient and of his or her disease. Therefore, the choice between weight loss, pharyngeal or maxillomandibular surgery, anterior mandibular positioners or tongue retaining devices, nasal CPAP, BiPAP, and tracheostomy depends on the patient's complaints and morbidity risk factors and on the respective side effects to benefits ratio of these therapeutic procedures."

            "abstract": "A placebo-controlled, partial cross-over, double-blind, randomized study was performed with 46 adults with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) to determine the effect of therapeutic and subtherapeutic (0-1 cm H(2)O) nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on polysomnographic and neuropsychological testing. The following neuropsychological tests were administered: Geriatric Depression Scale, Trail Making A and B, Digit Span Test Forward and Backward, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, SteerClear, Digit Symbol, Controlled Oral Word Association, and Complex Figure Recall. Compared with results without CPAP, subtherapeutic CPAP did not affect any measured polysomnographic parameter. Comparison of neuropsychological test results obtained between the initial periods of effective treatment (Group 1, 16.1 d; Group 2, 19.6 d; p = NS) in all subjects showed significant improvements in Digit Symbol, Digit Span Backward, and Complex Figure tests. However, there were no group differences in changes in test results during the period when one group was on effective CPAP and the other on ineffective CPAP (Group 1, 16.1 d; Group 2, 13.9 d; p = NS). The results indicate the feasibility and importance of using ineffective CPAP as a placebo treatment and the importance of including a placebo control in studies evaluating the effect of treatment on neuropsychological function in SAHS."

            "abstract": "The magnitude, determinants and reversibility of cognitive deficits associated with the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) are of clinical and research interest. A quantitative overview of impairment effect sizes (ESs) from case-control studies of cognitive performance in SAHS suggests that deficits broadly worsen with disease severity, with large average values for attentional (ES approximately 1.0 SD units) and executive (ES approximately 0.9 SD units) cognitive scores, and moderate values for memory-related (ES approximately 0.6 SD units) performance scores. A study of determinants of cognitive outcomes conducted in 150 patients with SAHS (AHI 5+ and > or =2 symptoms) showed significant but weak associations between a cognitive 'intellectual ability' component score (CS) and both AHI (r=-0.14) and minimum oxygen saturation (r = 0.15), linking increasing disease severity with poorer performance. A somewhat stronger correlation between a cognitive 'response slowing' CS and a 'wakefulness' CS was observed (r=-0.34). That sleepiness as well as hypoxemia might contribute to cognitive deficit has also been suggested by experimental sleep fragmentation in normals, producing small to moderate impairments (average ES approximately 0.3 SD units) in attention-biased scores. The reversibility of attentional cognitive deficits has been investigated through a meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled crossover studies of CPAP treatment, involving 98 SAHS patients (AHI 5+ and > or =2 symptoms). While cognitive outcomes showed at least trends towards better performance on CPAP than on placebo (p< or =0.1), the ESs of cognitive enhancements following CPAP were small (average ES approximately 0.2 SD units). This may be due either to the relatively mild study population, suboptimal CPAP use or to an irreversible component in cognitive impairment in SAHS."

We postulated the existence of a third component: a state-related transient increase in neural drive to the ventilatory pump muscles. To quantify this contribution, we measured the ventilatory response to arousal (VRA) in eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, applied at individually titrated levels. CPAP application reduced total pulmonary resistance (RL) to approximately normal levels, stabilizing ventilation and sleep state. Transient arousal from stage 2 sleep was induced using 5-sec tones (60-90 dB). Mean inspiratory flow increased above control on the second and third post-arousal breaths (P < 0.05), with a peak increase of 7.8 +/- 2.9 L/min while the accompanying changes in RL were significant. The time-course of VRA measured in three normal subjects under CPAP was similar to that observed in the OSA patients. However, elimination of CPAP prolonged the VRA time-course. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that: (1) during arousal, the increase in state-related neural respiratory drive is short-lived but not substantial; and (2) the resulting VRA time-course is shaped by the dynamics of the upper airway response to arousal."

End-tidal carbon dioxide pressure (PET(CO2)) was gradually reduced during non-rapid eye movement sleep by increasing tidal volume with pressure support mechanical ventilation, causing a reduction in diaphragm electromyogram amplitude until apnea/periodic breathing occurred. We used the reduction in PET(CO2) below spontaneous breathing required to produce apnea (DeltaPET(CO2)) as an index of the susceptibility to apnea. DeltaPET(CO2) was -5 mm Hg in control animals and changed in proportion to background ventilatory drive, increasing with metabolic acidosis (-6.7 mm Hg) and nonhypoxic peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation (almitrine; -5.9 mm Hg) and decreasing with metabolic alkalosis (-3.7 mm Hg). Hypoxia was the exception; DeltaPET(CO2) narrowed (-4.1 mm Hg) despite the accompanying hyperventilation. Thus, hyperventilation and hypocapnia, per se, widened the DeltaPET(CO2) thereby protecting against apnea and hypopnea, whereas reduced ventilatory drive and hypoventilation narrowed the DeltaPET(CO2) and increased the susceptibility to apnea. Hypoxia sensitized the ventilatory responsiveness to CO2 below eupnea and narrowed the DeltaPET(CO2); this effect of hypoxia was not attributable to an imbalance between peripheral and central chemoreceptor stimulation, per se. We conclude that the DeltaPET(CO2) and the ventilatory sensitivity to CO2 between eupnea and the apneic threshold are changeable in the face of variations in the magnitude, direction, and/or type of ventilatory stimulus, thereby altering the susceptibility for apnea, hypopnea, and periodic breathing in sleep."

The findings of epidemiological studies have implicated that OSA increases the risk for cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disturbances, such as insulin resistance, may link OSA to vascular morbidity. A number of observational clinical studies have evaluated the relationship between OSA and insulin resistance, suggesting an independent association. However, the confounding effect of obesity complicates the establishment of a causal relationship between OSA and insulin resistance. Potential mechanisms that may underpin this relationship were evaluated in animal and human experimental studies and include intermittent hypoxia, arousals from sleep with concomitant sympathetic activation and sleep fragmentation. Currently only three randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of OSA on insulin resistance have been published. In these trials OSA patients were randomly assigned to treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or subtherapeutic CPAP and treatment effects on various measures of insulin resistance were examined. In two of these trials there was no effect of CPAP on glucose metabolism and in one trial a small beneficial effect of CPAP was observed. Further carefully conducted clinical studies and randomized controlled interventional CPAP trials are needed to determine the extent to which OSA is a risk factor for diabetes and its effect on glucose metabolism."

The validity of polysomnography as the gold standard for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea has been challenged, primarily related to concerns that abnormalities on polysomnography do not correlate well with adverse outcomes, that those abnormalities have statistical more than clinical significance, and that performing polysomnograms on all children who snore is a practical impossibility. The aim of this article is to review the clinical utility of diagnostic tests other than polysomnography to diagnose obstructive sleep apnea, to highlight the limitations and strengths of polysomnography, to underscore the threshold levels of abnormalities detected on polysomnography that correlate with morbidity, and to discuss what the practical implications are for treatment."

SAS was divided into 4 types: obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), upper airways resistance syndrome (UARS), central sleep apnea syndrome (CSAS), and sleep hypoventilation syndrome (SHVS). CSAS is caused by temporary cessation of central drive to respiratory muscles, OSAHS results from partial or complete collapse of the pharynx, UARS have typical symptoms of OSAHS and no changes on polysomnography, whereas SHVS results from pathological PCO2 increase with subsequent hypoxemia. Increase in sympathetic activity, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone activation, impaired baroreflex and tonic vagal heart rate control are markers of increased risk of sudden death. CSAS is frequent in patients with CHF. Decreased cardiac output causes delayed transmission of changes in arterial blood gas tensions from the lungs to the chemoreceptors. Increase chemoreceptor sensitivity results from hypoxia and pulmonary congestion. Both types of apneas (OSAHS and CSAS) may occur in the same patient. Periodic cessation in central drive to respiratory muscles (CSAS) causes obstructive apneas/hypopneas by decreased tone of pharyngeal muscles and their collapse. Obstructive apneas (OSAHS) may lead to central apneas by frequent arousals, decreased left ventricular function and prolongation of circulation. Treatment of SAS is based on improvement of cardiovascular function, nocturnal supplementation of O2 and various forms of noninvasive positive airway pressure (i.e. CPAP)."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea is a state-dependent syndrome. It is characterized by repeated collapse of the upper airway as the result of the loss of waking neuromuscular drive as the brain changes from wakefulness to sleep. This produces a state-dependent decrease in muscle tone, which, together with other predisposing factors such as obesity and anatomical narrowing of the upper airway, results in the spectrum of sleep disordered breathing. Sleep-disordered breathing describes the continuum from simple snoring (pharyngeal vibration), to flow limitation (hypopnea), to complete cessation of breathing (apnea). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the common description of what is now appreciated as the sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome. The cardinal symptoms are snoring, observed apneas, and excessive daytime sleepiness. The immediate physical consequences are hypoxia, repeated sympathetic discharges, increased cardiac load, and repeated brain arousals. The repetitive arousals are required to restore airway patency, resulting in severely fragmented sleep and consequent sleep deprivation. The syndrome, untreated, produces significant cognitive and cardiorespiratory morbidity, and potential mortality. Compared to matched controls, patients with undiagnosed sleep apnea use twice the health resources and spend double the health-care dollars in the 10 years prior to diagnosis. Both trends are reversed by successful treatment. It is by definition a sleep-related illness and can be observed and evaluated only when the patient is asleep. Polysomnography is the laboratory procedure to study sleep and its protean dysfunctions. Multiple physiologic parameters are required to document the various types of sleep disorders as well as to establish the origin of pathologic sleep fragmentation. Complete polysomnography includes (but is not limited to) electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram ((EOG), electromyogram (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory effort, air flow, and oxygen saturation. Treatment options for obstructive sleep apnea include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), oral appliances, uvulopalatal and/or maxillomandibular surgery, positional control, and weight loss. The efficacy of each depends on the individual anatomy and the severity of the sleep-disordered breathing. CPAP is accepted as the most reliable treatment regardless of anatomy and severity. It is currently the only treatment modality which can be titrated during sleep and requires simultaneous polysomnography."

The validity of applying linear control theory for stabilization must then be re-examined. Critical threshold values and ranges of parameters were predicted which caused a change (bifurcation) from limit cycle periodic breathing to stable breathing. Changes in lung volume were predicted to form a bifurcation during CHF-CSA where stability and instability can involve a lung volume change as small as 0.1 l. CSA therapy based on reducing control loop gain was predicted to be relatively ineffective during stable limit cycle oscillation. The relative ratios of durations of ventilation to apnea (T(v)/T(a)) during periodic breathing were primarily determined by peripheral chemoreceptor dynamics during crescendo, de-crescendo, and apnea phases of CSA."

They subsequently commenced nasal CPAP (nCPAP) treatment and their progress was followed. A limited sleep study on the patient with MNS demonstrated moderate/severe OSAS with an AHI of 33 events/h. Commencement of nCPAP resulted in symptomatic improvement. Overnight oximetry in the patient with TCS showed repeated desaturation to SpO2<90%. Subsequent treatment by nCPAP almost completely abolished the desaturation events. Overnight polysomnography in the patient with PRS demonstrated severe OSAS with an AHI of 49 events/h. After 3 years of nCPAP therapy, this patient requested discontinuation of treatment. Subsequent polysomnography without nCPAP revealed an AHI of <5 events/h. The use of nCPAP in the patients with MNS and TCS resulted in effective control of their sleep abnormalities. Mandibular growth and enlargement of the posterior airway space led to resolution of OSAS in the patient with PRS. There is a definite role for nCPAP therapy in patients with congenital micrognathia and OSAS.

CPAP was retitrated to eliminate apnea/hypopnea but to maintain inspiratory flow limitation (sham night). Each subject was studied on 2 separate nights. These two studies are separated by 1 mo of optimal nasal CPAP treatment for a minimum of 4-6 h/night. The device was capable of covert pressure monitoring. During night 1 (N1), study subjects used nasal CPAP at suboptimal pressure to have significant air flow limitation (>60% breaths) without apneas/hypopneas. After stable sleep was reached, we induced brief isocapnic hypoxia [inspired O(2) fraction (FI(O(2))) = 8%] (3 min) followed by 5 min of room air. This sequence was repeated 10 times. Measurements were obtained during control, hypoxia, and at 5, 20, and 40 min of recovery for ventilation, timing (n = 11), and supraglottic pressure (n = 6). Upper airway resistance (Rua) was calculated at peak inspiratory flow. During the recovery period, there was no change in minute ventilation (99 +/- 8% of control), despite decreased Rua to 58 +/- 24% of control (P < 0.05). There was a reduction in the ratio of inspiratory time to total time for a breath (duty cycle) (0.5 to 0.45, P < 0.05) but no effect on inspiratory time. During night 2 (N2), the protocol of N1 was repeated. N2 revealed no changes compared with N1 during the recovery period. In conclusion, 1) reduced Rua in the recovery period indicates LTF of upper airway dilators; 2) lack of hyperpnea in the recovery period suggests that thoracic pump muscles do not demonstrate LTF; 3) we speculate that LTF may temporarily stabilize respiration in OSA patients after repeated apneas/hypopneas; and 4) nasal CPAP did not alter the ability of OSA patients to elicit LTF at the thoracic pump muscle."

            "abstract": "The control of breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follows the same basic principles as in normal subjects, both awake and asleep, with an expected lower feedback response during sleep. This impacts nocturnal gas exchange and sleep quality most profoundly in patients with more severe COPD, as multiple factors come into play. Hypoventilation causes the most important gas-exchange alteration in COPD patients, leading to hypercapnia and hypoxemia, especially during rapid-eye-movement sleep, when marked respiratory muscle atonia occurs. The hypoxia leads to increased arousals, sleep disruption, pulmonary hypertension, and higher mortality. The primary mechanisms for this include decreased ventilatory responsiveness to hypercapnia, reduced respiratory muscle output, and marked increases in upper airway resistance. In the presence of more profound daytime hypercapnia, polysomnography should be considered (over nocturnal pulse oximetry) to rule out other co-existing sleep-related breathing disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea (overlap syndrome) and obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Present consensus guidelines provide insight into the proper use of oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, and nocturnal noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation for those conditions, but several issues remain contentious. In order to provide optimal therapy to patients, the clinician must take into account certain reimbursement and implementation-process obstacles and the guidelines for treatment and coverage criteria."

            "title": "Clinical guidelines for the manual titration of positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.",
            "abstract": "Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are used to treat patients with sleep related breathing disorders (SRBDs), including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). After a patient is diagnosed with OSA, the current standard of practice involves performing attended polysomnography (PSG), during which positive airway pressure is adjusted throughout the recording period to determine the optimal pressure for maintaining upper airway patency. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) represent the two forms of PAP that are manually titrated during PSG to determine the single fixed pressure of CPAP or the fixed inspiratory and expiratory positive airway pressures (IPAP and EPAP, respectively) of BPAP for subsequent nightly usage. A PAP Titration Task Force of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine reviewed the available literature. Based on this review, the Task Force developed these recommendations for conducting CPAP and BPAP titrations. Major recommendations are as follows: (1) All potential PAP titration candidates should receive adequate PAP education, hands-on demonstration, careful mask fitting, and acclimatization prior to titration. (2) CPAP (IPAP and/or EPAP for patients on BPAP) should be increased until the following obstructive respiratory events are eliminated (no specific order) or the recommended maximum CPAP (IPAP for patients on BPAP) is reached: apneas, hypopneas, respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs), and snoring. (3) The recommended minimum starting CPAP should be 4 cm H2O for pediatric and adult patients, and the recommended minimum starting IPAP and EPAP should be 8 cm H2O and 4 cm H2O, respectively, for pediatric and adult patients on BPAP. (4) The recommended maximum CPAP should be 15 cm H2O (or recommended maximum IPAP of 20 cm H2O if on BPAP) for patients < 12 years, and 20 cm H2O (or recommended maximum IPAP of 30 cm H2O if on BPAP) for patients > or = 12 years. (5) The recommended minimum IPAP-EPAP differential is 4 cm H2O and the recommended maximum IPAP-EPAP differential is 10 cm H2O (6) CPAP (IPAP and/or EPAP for patients on BPAP depending on the type of event) should be increased by at least 1 cm H2O with an interval no shorter than 5 min, with the goal of eliminating obstructive respiratory events. (7) CPAP (IPAP and EPAP for patients on BPAP) should be increased from any CPAP (or IPAP) level if at least 1 obstructive apnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 2 obstructive apneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (8) CPAP (IPAP for patients on BPAP) should be increased from any CPAP (or IPAP) level if at least 1 hypopnea is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 hypopneas are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (9) CPAP (IPAP for patients on BPAP) should be increased from any CPAP (or IPAP) level if at least 3 RERAs are observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 5 RERAs are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (10) CPAP (IPAP for patients on BPAP) may be increased from any CPAP (or IPAP) level if at least 1 min of loud or unambiguous snoring is observed for patients < 12 years, or if at least 3 min of loud or unambiguous snoring are observed for patients > or = 12 years. (11) The titration algorithm for split-night CPAP or BPAP titration studies should be identical to that of full-night CPAP or BPAP titration studies, respectively. (12) If the patient is uncomfortable or intolerant of high pressures on CPAP, the patient may be tried on BPAP. If there are continued obstructive respiratory events at 15 cm H2O of CPAP during the titration study, the patient may be switched to BPAP. (13) The pressure of CPAP or BPAP selected for patient use following the titration study should reflect control of the patient's obstructive respiration by a low (preferably < 5 per hour) respiratory disturbance index (RDI) at the selected pressure, a minimum sea level SpO2 above 90% at the pressure, and with a leak within acceptable parameters at the pressure.) (14) An optimal titration reduces RDI < 5 for at least a 15-min duration and should include supine REM sleep at the selected pressure that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings. (15) A good titration reduces RDI < or = 10 or by 50% if the baseline RDI < 15 and should include supine REM sleep that is not continually interrupted by spontaneous arousals or awakenings at the selected pressure. (16) An adequate titration does not reduce the RDI < or = 10 but reduces the RDI by 75% from baseline (especially in severe OSA patients), or one in which the titration grading criteria for optimal or good are met with the exception that supine REM sleep did not occur at the selected pressure. (17) An unacceptable titration is one that does not meet any one of the above grades. (18) A repeat PAP titration study should be considered if the initial titration does not achieve a grade of optimal or good and, if it is a split-night PSG study, it fails to meet AASM criteria (i.e., titration duration should be > 3 hr)."

We could not find evidence that a short-term educational intervention led to improvements in usage. Cognitive behavioural therapy led to the largest increases in average machine usage, partly because more participants were prepared to try out the treatment. Studies generally recruited CPAP naive patients whose sleep apnoea was severe. Trials in patients who have struggled to persist with treatment are required, as there is currently little evidence in this population.

Six articles with 181 patients were included in this meta-analysis, including five before-after studies and one matched-control study. The meta-analysis showed that CPAP was associated with a statistically significant reduction in pulmonary artery pressure in OSA patients (standardized mean difference -1.34, 95% confidence interval: -2.33 to -0.34, P = 0.009).

The impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), the first line therapy of OSA, on metabolic or inflammatory markers is still debated. A systematic literature search using several databases was performed. We provide a systematic analysis of randomized studies comparing therapeutic versus sham CPAP intervention and also include studies using a CPAP withdrawal design. We addressed the impact of CPAP on the following cardiometabolic biomarkers: 1) plasma and urine catecholamines and their metabolites that reflect sympathetic activity; 2) insulin resistance and lipid metabolism biomarkers; 3) oxidative stress, systemic and vascular inflammation biomarkers; 4) liver enzymes highlighting the association between OSA and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD); 5) coagulation biomarkers. The impact of CPAP on sympathetic activity is robust across studies and occurs rapidly. In contrast to sympathetic activity, the well-designed studies included in this review failed to demonstrate that CPAP alters metabolic or inflammatory markers in OSA. CPAP did not change glucose, lipids, insulin resistance levels or the ratio of patients with metabolic syndrome. In unselected OSA patients, it is not realistic to expect a clinically relevant decrease in cardiometabolic biomarkers with CPAP therapy."

Moreover, a considerable proportion of patients with essential hypertension have OSA. OSA also appears to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment substantially reduces daytime somnolence and improves quality of life in patients with OSA. However, the effects of CPAP treatment on blood pressure (BP) are questionable. The aim of the present review is to summarize the evidence regarding the association between OSA with hypertension and the effects of CPAP treatment on BP in patients with OSA. The severity of OSA directly correlates with the increase in BP. Moreover, patients with OSA are at increased risk for developing hypertension. However, CPAP treatment does not result in substantial reductions in BP in unselected patients with OSA with moderate adherence to this treatment.

Children with PWS are at risk of developing SDB secondary to both deficient autonomic sleep control and upper airway obstruction (UAO). It has been suggested that GH exacerbates pre-existing gas-exchange deficiencies in three ways: (a) by stimulation of adenotonsillar hypertrophy;16 17 (b) by a rise in basal metabolic rate with a resultant rise in oxygen demand;18 and (c) by normalisation of previously decreased hydration with augmentation of volume load.19 Are we withholding GH therapy, a treatment known to be of benefit in PWS, without adequate evidence to justify our actions? We consider it safe to treat severely obese children with GH once SDB is addressed using respiratory support such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP).

Moreover, APAP reduces the treatment pressure substantially. Although an improvement of the patient's compliance has not consistently been proven, most patients prefer APAP versus constant CPAP. APAP devices use different algorithms depending on the primary purpose of the application. Therefore, a clear distinction between automatic titration and treatment is of major relevance. While titration devices aim at the finding of one single pressure which is fixed to a constant CPAP device, automatic treatment means the chronic use of APAP at home for optimal adaptation of the treatment pressure to the actual requirements of the patient. A high constant CPAP level, huge pressure variability, insufficient compliance with constant CPAP may be indications for APAP treatment. The main reason for automatic titration is the standardisation of the initiation process."

Twelve healthy volunteers with socially disruptive snoring underwent a baseline polysomnogram along with a battery of visual analog scales (VASs) to measure daytime sleepiness, snoring level, pain, and disturbances of speech and swallowing. After radiofrequency tissue reduction of the palate, they were re-evaluated with a mean follow-up after the final procedure of 15.7 +/- 5.1 (mean +/- SD) weeks. As rated by the bed partner, a significant reduction in the level of snoring occurred in all 12 patients, with a mean pretreatment snoring level of 8.3 +/- 2.1 to a mean posttreatment snoring level of 2.1 +/- 1.4. (Student t test, P < 0.0001) These patients required an average of 2.3 treatment sessions each. Nine of 12 had a reduction in snoring from a bothersome level (VAS range 5-10) to a nonbothersome level (VAS range 0-3). Daytime sleepiness as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (0-24) decreased from 10.8 +/- 4.4 to 8.3 +/- 4.1 (P = 0.011). Posttreatment pain was considered absent or minimal in 11 of 12 patients and was managed with acetaminophen. No significant adverse events or complications were reported."

The study cohort enrolled 67 consecutive patients, who underwent septoplasty plus modified uvulopharyngopalatoplasty (mUPPP) with or without modified tongue base suspension (mTBS) due to CPAP intolerance, and who had residual OSA requiring CPAP therapy [non-responders to surgery, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >15 events/h] that had been confirmed by control polysomnography at the sixth month postoperatively. A questionnaire including questions on postoperative CPAP use, problems faced during CPAP use after the surgery, change in OSA symptoms, and satisfaction with the surgery was designed, and filled through interviews. Seventeen (25.4 %) patients had septoplasty plus mUPPP and 50 (74.6 %) had septoplasty plus mUPPP combined with mTBS. Postoperatively, mean AHI (45.00 ± 19.76 vs. 36.60 ± 18.34), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score (18.00 ± 4.45 vs. 13.00 ± 4.72), oxygen desaturation index (ODI) (48.98 ± 16.73 vs. 37.81 ± 17.03), and optimal CPAP level (11.80 ± 1.40 vs. 8.96 ± 1.20) were decreased (p < 0.001 for all parameters). Fifty-nine percent of patients reported that they fairly satisfied with the surgery and 49.2 % reported that their symptoms were completely resolved. While none of the cases could tolerate CPAP before surgery, almost half (47.8 %) of the cases used CPAP without problems postoperatively. Postoperative CPAP users had significantly higher postoperative AHI (p = 0.001), supine AHI (p = 0.009), ESS (p = 0.019), and ODI (p = 0.014), and significantly lower postoperative minimum O2 saturation (p = 0.001) compared with non-users.

Twenty-one adult men with untreated OSA were studied with full polysomnography on each of four nights: diagnostic, manual and AutoSet nCPAP titration (in random order), and conventional fixed-pressure nCPAP at the pressure recommended by the AutoSet titration. Titration was satisfactorily performed in 20 of 21 subjects. Severe mask leak prevented automated titration in one subject and caused transient unnecessary increases in pressure in three subjects. In the 20 subjects, respiratory disturbance index (RDI) was 60.3 +/- 5.7 events/h (mean +/- SEM) on the diagnostic night. RDI was lower with manual titration (10.1 +/- 3.0, p < 0.001), and lower still with Autoset (2.8 +/- 0.9, p < 0.01) and fixed pressure (2.5 +/- 0.7, p = ns versus AutoSet) nCPAP. There were similar changes in the arousal index, which was 52.7 +/- 4.6 events/h on the diagnostic night, 14.2 +/- 2.4 with manual titration and 8.9 +/- 0.9 with AutoSet titration, and 9.5 +/- 1.0 on the night of conventional fixed-pressure CPAP (p < 0.001 versus diagnostic).

            "abstract": "During respiration, upper airway (UA) collapse occurs when the forces generated from the negative UA pressures exceed the forces produced by the UA muscles; which leads to loose soft tissue at the back of the mouth. At predetermined titration pressure, the Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) normally provides a continuous pressurized and humidified air to prevent airway collapse. However, high titration pressures are not always tolerated by patients and may lead to damaging effects including stroke symptoms for cardiovascular disease patients. This paper hypothesizes that superimposed pressure oscillation can modulate the loose tissue and allow unblocking the upper airway passages to help reduce the required titration pressure. Using MRI scans, this paper investigates the effects of using pressure oscillations superimposed on the CPAP to keep the airway open at lower pressure distributions inside the upper airway and consequently increase the patients' comfort and reduce their rejection to the CPAP."

One hundred and eleven subjects, aged 25 to 65 yr, with a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of 5 to 30 and without subjective pathologic sleepiness, were randomized to nasal CPAP or to CT. Ninety-seven subjects were followed-up after 8 wk. Treatment response was assessed from changes between baseline and follow-up measures of mood, energy/fatigue, and functional status/general health. Of the 51 subjects randomized to CPAP, 25 (49%) experienced an improved outcome, as compared with 12 of 46 of subjects (26%) randomized to CT (p < 0.05). The odds of experiencing a treatment response in the CPAP as compared with the CT group were 2.72 (OR: 1.18 to 6.58, 95% CI). A beneficial effect of CPAP over CT was most evident among individuals without sinus problems and among subjects with hypertension or diabetes. Differential treatment responses were not related to degree of baseline sleepiness or SDB. This suggests that middle-aged snorers with relatively low levels of SDB (RDI < 30) may benefit more from nasal CPAP than from less specific therapy directed at improving breathing during sleep. CPAP therapy may be beneficial to a broader group of subjects than previously appreciated."

Our structured search revealed 141 articles for systematic scrutiny, of which 87 were suitable for inclusion in the evidence base, including 15 Level I to II randomized controlled trials and 5 of these trials with placebo-controlled treatment. The efficacy of OAs was established for controlling OSA in some but not all patients with success (defined as no more than 10 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep) achieved in an average of 52% of treated patients. Effects on sleepiness and quality of life were also demonstrated, but improvements in other neurocognitive outcomes were not consistent. The mechanism of OA therapy is related to opening of the upper airway as demonstrated by imaging and physiologic monitoring. Treatment adherence is variable with patients reporting using the appliance a median of 77% of nights at 1 year. Minor adverse effects were frequent whereas major adverse effects were uncommon. Minor tooth movement and small changes in the occlusion developed in some patients after prolonged use, but the long-term dental significance of this is uncertain. In comparison to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), OAs are less efficacious in reducing the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), but OAs appear to be used more (at least by self report), and in many studies were preferred over CPAP when the treatments were compared. OAs have also been compared favorably to surgical modification of the upper airway (uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, UPPP). Comparisons between OAs of different designs have produced variable findings. The literature of OA therapy for OSA now provides better evidence for the efficacy of this treatment modality and considerable guidance regarding the frequency of adverse effects and the indications for use in comparison to CPAP and UPPP."

Recent evidence indicates that alterations in upper airway anatomy and disturbances in neuromuscular control both play a role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea. We hypothesized that subjects without sleep apnea are more capable of mounting vigorous neuromuscular responses to upper airway obstruction than subjects with sleep apnea. To address this hypothesis we lowered nasal pressure to induce upper airway obstruction to the verge of periodic obstructive hypopneas (cycling threshold). Ten patients with obstructive sleep apnea and nine weight-, age-, and sex-matched controls were studied during sleep. Responses in genioglossal electromyography (EMG(GG)) activity (tonic, peak phasic, and phasic EMG(GG)), maximal inspiratory airflow (V(I)max), and pharyngeal transmural pressure (P(TM)) were assessed during similar degrees of sustained conditions of upper airway obstruction and compared with those obtained at a similar nasal pressure under transient conditions. Control compared with sleep apnea subjects demonstrated greater EMG(GG), V(I)max, and P(TM) responses at comparable levels of mechanical and ventilatory stimuli at the cycling threshold, during sustained compared with transient periods of upper airway obstruction. Furthermore, the increases in EMG(GG) activity in control compared with sleep apnea subjects were observed in the tonic but not the phasic component of the EMG response. We conclude that sustained periods of upper airway obstruction induce greater increases in tonic EMG(GG), V(I)max, and P(TM) in control subjects. Our findings suggest that neuromuscular responses protect individuals without sleep apnea from developing upper airway obstruction during sleep."

We aimed to investigate the effect of acetazolamide on the traits contributing to OSA and its severity. Acetazolamide (500 mg twice daily) was administered for 1 week to 13 OSA subjects. Pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility, loop gain (LG), upper-airway muscle responsiveness (gain) and the arousal threshold were determined using multiple 3 min 'CPAP pressure drops': pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility was quantified as the ventilation at CPAP=0. LG was defined as the ratio of the ventilatory overshoot to the preceding reduction in ventilation. Upper-airway gain was taken as the ratio of the increase in ventilation to the increase in ventilatory drive across the drop. Arousal threshold was quantified as the level of ventilatory drive associated with arousal. The apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)was assessed on separate nights using standard polysomnography. Acetazolamide reduced the median [interquartile range] LG (3.4 [2.4-5.4] versus 2.0 [1.4-3.5]; P <0.05) and NREM AHI (50 [36-57] versus 24 [13-42] events h-1; P <0.05), but did not significantly alter pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility, upper-airway gain, or arousal threshold. There was a modest correlation between the percentage reduction in LG and the percentage reduction in AHI (r =0.660, P =0.05). Our findings suggest that acetazolamide can improve OSA, probably due to reductions in the sensitivity of the ventilatory control system.

In a randomised, parallel, double-blinded, controlled study, the present authors examined the use of heated humidification during a single night laboratory nCPAP titration in untreated OSA patients and its effect on nasal symptoms, nasal airway resistance (NAR), effective pressure and treatment tolerability and acceptance.

We tested the hypothesis that data from formal scoring of the sleep and breathing patterns observed at the best achievable pressure during titration can predict CPAP use and effectiveness, as our clinical experience suggested otherwise. The relationship between CPAP titration scores (apnoea/hypopnoea frequency, arousal frequency and sleep staging) and subsequent CPAP use was examined in 150 sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome patients. One hundred patients were continuing CPAP therapy and 50 were randomly selected patients who had discontinued CPAP. Within the CPAP group, titration scores were compared with CPAP machine use, subjective daytime sleepiness and requirements for airway pressure adjustment. Respiratory irregularities and arousals during titration did not relate to outcome. Sleep-stage analysis revealed a weak relationship between more wakefulness during titration and CPAP discontinuation (P=0.02). There was a correlation between more prolonged Stage 4 sleep during titration and reduced sleepiness on established therapy (P=0.002), but this explained less than 12% of the variance. The absence of rapid eye movement sleep during titration was not associated with poorer outcomes. We conclude that routine scoring of breathing and sleep patterns observed during CPAP titration is of little clinical value, as the results do not predict outcome for individual patients. Satisfactory CPAP therapy may be established even if significant numbers of apnoeas/hypopnoeas or arousals are observed at the optimal pressure during titration."

Hypoxia, Hypercapnia and repetitive sympathetic elevations are well known elements in the control of the arterial resistance. Furthermore investigations in patients with sleep apnea showed changes of the pulsatile secretion pattern within the renin-angiotensin-system and the antinatriuretic peptides. These changes were reversible under nasal CPAP-therapy, nycturia as a frequent symptom disappeared. Nevertheless neither hypoxia nor intrathoracic pressure changes nor the arousals can assert the longterm influence on the blood pressure alone, a multifactorial confluence must be assumed. Further it is unclear how a tonic increase of the arterial blood pressure may occur in dependence of the REM- and NREM-sleep cycle changes as well as during daytime. First investigations in sleeping man seem to indicate, that a disturbance of the physiological coupling of breathing and circulation may present a pathogenetic element. Finally it remains open, whether the changes of the cardiorespiratory coupling during sleep of control persons and of patients with OSA are comparable, and whether they may be procured for an explanation of the pathogenesis of arterial and pulmonary hypertension. Further investigations in the control mechanisms of breathing and circulation related to the circuits of chemo- and baroreception, thresholds during wakefulness and sleep may be of decisive help to process the question, to what extent clinical states find a correlate in a disturbed cardiorespiratory coupling and, much more significantly, whether a disturbance in the physiological cardiorespiratory coupling appears already in early states of a disease.

Body composition and blood pressure measurements were recorded. Overnight polysomnography was conducted to confirm or refute OSA.

Apnoea-hypopnoea Index was higher in patients with OSA (24 ± 18·6) than controls without OSA (non-OSA) (2·6 ± 1·1; P < 0·0001). Metabolic syndrome was present in 35 (57%) of those with OSA compared with 4 (13%) of controls (P < 0·0001). Twenty-four polypeptides were candidates for differential distribution (P < 0·01), although these differences did not reach significance after multiple testing. Sequences were determined for eight peptides demonstrating origins from collagens and fibrinogen alpha.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In this study, we report for the first time, urinary proteomic profile analyses using CE-MS in OSA and non-OSA obese groups. The differences in urinary proteomic profiles prior to adjustment for multiple testing, with increased metabolic syndrome in obese OSA subjects, suggest that there may be a role for CE-MS in characterising urinary profiles in severely obese populations with OSA."

            "abstract": "Melatonin is a pineal hormone that regulates the human cycle of sleep and wakefulness. Plasma melatonin levels were investigated in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS). In total, 20 patients with OSAS and 11 healthy controls were studied. OSAS patients were tested twice: on the night of diagnostic polysomnography and the night of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) titration. Controls were tested on one occasion. Plasma melatonin levels were determined at 23:00 h (light period), at 02:00 h (dark period) and at 06:00 h (light period) in patients and control subjects using the radioimmunoassay method. The control subjects showed a nocturnal melatonin peak value at 02:00 h (70.6+/-14 pg.mL(-1)). However, this nocturnal melatonin peak was absent in the OSAS patients. The highest melatonin value was found in OSAS patients on the night of diagnosis, at 06:00 h (49.3+/-36.8 pg.mL(-1)). It was found that the melatonin level in OSAS patients at 06:00 h was significantly lower in the night of titration (35.6+/-37.9 pg.mL(-1)) than in the diagnosis night. However, the melatonin levels at either 23:00 h or 02:00 h in OSAS patients did not differ significantly when comparing levels in the night of diagnostic polysomnography (23:00 h: 31.6+/-29.8 pg.mL(-1); 02:00 h: 47.4+/-33.8 pg.mL(-1)) with levels in the night of CPAP titration (23:00 h: 20.2+/-10.3 pg.mL(-1); 02:00 h: 37.7+/-27.5 pg.mL(-1)). Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome have an abnormal melatonin secretion pattern. The absence of a nocturnal serum melatonin peak could be partially related to the difficulty that these patients have in achieving a normal sleep-wakefulness pattern."

The aim of this study was to further evaluate the impact of nasal obstruction in OSAS. Therefore, we investigated 2 groups of OSAS-patients, matched pairs concerning gender, age, and BMI: OSAS-patients with nasal obstruction (N, n = 28), total nasal airflow < 500 ccm/s (referred to 150 pa pressure of difference or unilateral nasal resistance > 1 pa/ccm/s), and 28 OSAS-patients without nasal obstruction (control-group K, total nasal airflow > 700 ccm/s [referred to 150 pa pressure of difference or unilateral nasal resistance > 1 pa/ccm/s]). We performed anterior rhinomanometry, lung-function testing, cardio-respiratory polygraphy, and patients answered a standardized questionnaire. We found the following significant differences: 1) N complained more often (n = 17) about dyspnea at night than K (n = 7, p < 0.05, Chi2-test). 2) N had a higher apnea index (20.4 +/- 19.0/h) than K (9.6 +/- 10.0/h, p < 0.05, Student's t-test). There were, however, no significant differences concerning lung function, number of nocturnal hypopneas, nocturnal SaO2 and heart rate. Our results underline the importance of nasal ventilation in the pathogenesis of OSAS. At least in moderate cases of OSAS a therapy of nasal obstruction might be of success in order to abolish nCPAP-therapy or might reduce nasal problems during nCPAP-therapy and thus ameliorate patient's therapy compliance."

Oral modafinil promotes wakefulness in patients with OSA/HS and SWSD. It is an effective adjunctive therapy in patients with residual excessive sleepiness associated with OSA/HS who are receiving nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy. In SWSD, the drug improves night-time wakefulness without disrupting daytime sleep. Modafinil is generally well tolerated in patients with OSA/HS or SWSD and has a low abuse potential. Thus, modafinil is a valuable new treatment option for use in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with OSA/HS (as an adjunct to nCPAP) or SWSD."

Compliance can be improved with an intensive educational programme and patient support, but this is not practical in most centres given the large numbers of patients coming forward for treatment. Several studies have evaluated correlations between various parameters at diagnosis in order to anticipate patients' behaviour and to avoid the social and health implications of undertreated SAHS. We have evaluated the use of additional data derived during a 2 week home CPAP trial to identify factors associated with longer term use of CPAP and compliance.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Following a diagnostic study, 209 patients were offered a CPAP machine for a 2 week home trial.

            "abstract": "Although the Starling resistor behavior of the upper airway during sleep has been well established in health and disease, its physiological implications have not been fully appreciated. The purposes of the present communication are to reassess the current state of knowledge within the framework of the Starling resistor concept and to examine the implications of the concept on homeostatic feedback respiratory control and the pathogenesis of the sleep apnea syndrome. The main inferences drawn from the assessment include: (1) Owing to the Starling resistor properties of the upper airway and the well-organized neurochemical control mechanism, the upper airway performs important homeostatic flow regulatory function; it appropriately dampens the potentially unstable breathing during sleep and prevents the PaCO2 from falling below the apneic threshold; (2) Under certain conditions, the upper airway flow regulatory function fails to achieve appropriate dampening, leading to development of a variety of sleep-related breathing disorders that include underdamping due to overly sensitive central chemoresponsiveness and/or excessive lung to chemoreceptor transport lag--central sleep apnea; overdamping due to upper airway obstructive dysfunction--obstructive sleep apnea and/or hypopnea; and, finally, conditions with mixed features of central underdamping with coexisting collapsible upper airway; and (3) Successful treatment of these conditions requires restoration of appropriate damping. The overdamping imposed by the faulty upper airway is effectively reduced by surgical and medical approaches, and by application of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Reduction of PaCO2 by use of acetalzolamide and/or aminophylline reduces the plant gain, thus effectively offsetting the underdamping of central origin. Owing to the dual effect of nasal CPAP on the upper airway and respiratory pump, use of nasal CPAP can also effectively reduce the plant gain, accounting for the therapeutic effect of nasal CPAP on the central sleep apnea."

Therefore, it is often difficult to determine why an individual has OSA or to what extent the various traits contribute to the development of OSA. In this study, we present a noninvasive method for measuring four important physiological traits causing OSA: 1) pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility, 2) ventilatory control system gain (loop gain), 3) the ability of the upper airway to dilate/stiffen in response to an increase in ventilatory drive, and 4) arousal threshold. These variables are measured using a single maneuver in which continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is dropped from an optimum to various suboptimum pressures for 3- to 5-min intervals during sleep. Each individual's set of traits is entered into a physiological model of OSA that graphically illustrates the relative importance of each trait in that individual. Results from 14 subjects (10 with OSA) are described. Repeatability measurements from separate nights are also presented for four subjects. The measurements and model illustrate the multifactorial nature of OSA pathogenesis and how, in some individuals, small adjustments of one or another trait (which might be achievable with non-CPAP agents) could potentially treat OSA. This technique could conceivably be used clinically to define a patient's physiology and guide therapy based on the traits."

Mouth breathing and chronic snoring occur frequently in children, with the incidence of snoring, identical for both sexes, varying between 3.2 and 27%. Difficulties in sleeping begin between the ages of the 3 and 9, peaking between 3 and 6. These results demonstrate, in a general way, the disparity between growth of the adenoids and tonsils, and upper airway growth. A differential diagnosis between the various pathological possibilities is based on the observed clinical signs and symptoms, analysis of cephalometric radiographs, polysomnography, a nocturnal cardio-respiratory polygraph and a video film taken during sleep. Snoring is the most characteristic sign of OSAHS in children. We do not yet have available any synthetic study that would sum up results of studies of sleep disorders in children. Nevertheless, we can define obstructive sleep apnea in children as the partial or total cessation of nose and mouth breathing for a period double that of the normal respiratory cycle. Classical treatment of children who suffer from severe respiratory difficulties during sleep, after identification of the etiology of the problem, consists of surgical removal of the adenoids or tonsils and, in certain, continuous positive pressure to assist breathing. The authors of this article have worked with 137 patients between the ages of 6 and 9, 77 of whom were chronic snorers with an average age of 7 years 6 months. The average age of the control group of 60 children was 7 years 2 months. We collected clinical data, medical histories, and distributed a questionnaire to determine individual sleep and vigilance behavior of each child in the sample. To complete our evaluation, we made a cephalometric analysis of facial type, antero-postero skeletal pattern, upper airways, and hyoid bone position. The symptom that we encountered most frequently in young chronic snorers was agitated and uneasy sleep, sometimes accompanied by bed-wetting and cervical hyperextension. We often found daytime symptoms of hyperactivity and personality or behavioral problems. Hypertrophy of the adenoids, the adenoidal fascia, and the tonsils were also frequent clinical signs. The cephalometric analyses often showed the patients to be of the dolichocephalic facial type, often with the mandible rotated posteriorly. The children were as likely to be classified as Class II owing to retrognathic mandibles as to be Class III owing to maxillary deficiencies or mandibular excess. At the level of the upper airways, it appears that the development of snoring can be explained by a reduction in the dimensions of the upper pharynges accompanied by an increase in the dimensions of the middle and lower pharynges."

The cardinal symptom, i.e. snoring, in connection with nocturnal perspiration, mouth breathing, susceptibility to infection of the upper respiratory tract and tiredness during the day or hypermotility, can be an indication of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The common treatment is adenotomy unless there is indication of allergic swelling of the nasal mucous membrane. Other anatomic predispositions for OSA must be considered (tonsillar hypertrophy, midfacial hypoplasia, micro- and retrognathia, e.g. in patients with Down's syndrome or patients with preoperated cleft lip face palate). Inhalative nasal corticoids are a possible alternative to adenotomy in light to medium grade cases of OSA. Tonsillotomy is indicated only in serious OSA cases, tonsillectomy is only justified in cases of chronic tonsillitis or more than 4-6 cases of angina in the last 12 months. Treatment with nasal CPAP is tolerated well also in childhood. Patients with central hypoventilation syndromes, insufficiency of the respiratory musculature or obesitas hypoventilation syndrome can usually be ventilated by non-invasive approach using a nasal mask. Patients suffering from parasomnia should always be asked if they snore at night because if OSA is diagnosed and treated, there are very good prospects of curing somnambulism as well. Like with narcolepsy and REM sleep, a close HLA association has also been identified for family somnambulism. In cases of parasomnia which becomes manifest only after very young age frontal lobe epilepsy should be suspected and searched by polysomnographic and simultaneous continuous nocturnal video surveillance. If reversive development or unclear motoric and utterance phenomena are observed, sleep-bound convulsive disorder should be looked for. Syncopal events can require comprehensive cardiological diagnosis, including exclusion of nightly disorders of the cardiac rhythm."

The objective of this study was to identify a breath profile in OSA recurrence by use of secondary-electrospray-ionization-mass spectrometry (SESI-MS).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with OSA effectively treated with CPAP were randomised to either withdraw treatment (subtherapeutic CPAP) or continue therapeutic CPAP for 2 weeks. Exhaled breath analysis by untargeted SESI-MS was performed at baseline and 2 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the change in exhaled molecular breath pattern.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      30 patients with OSA were randomised and 26 completed the trial according to the protocol. CPAP withdrawal led to a recurrence of OSA (mean difference in change of oxygen desaturation index between groups +30.3/h; 95% CI 19.8/h,40.7/h, p<0.001) which was accompanied by a significant change in 62 exhaled features (16 metabolites identified). The panel of discriminating mass-spectral features allowed differentiation between treated and untreated OSA with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 84.6%.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Exhaled breath analysis by SESI-MS allows rapid and accurate detection of OSA recurrence. The technique has the potential to characterise an individual's metabolic response to OSA and thus makes a comprehensible phenotyping of OSA possible.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration number:\n        \nNCT02050425 (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov)."

OSAS is also associated with cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. In heart failure, OSAS can lead to worsening of symptoms.

Single ventilator breaths of tidal volume (VT) 75-200% of control caused apnea (up to three times eupneic expiratory time [TE]) when applied during the initial 25-65% of expiratory time. When continuous controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV) was applied with ventilator frequency increased as little as 1 cycle/min > eupnea and Pa(CO(2)) and VT maintained at near eupneic control levels, EMG(di) was silenced and triangularis sterni EMG (EMG(ts)) became tonic within 2 to 5 ventilator cycles. On cessation of normocapnic CMV, apnea ensued with TE ranging from 1.2 to five times eupneic TE. The spontaneous VT and EMG(di) determined immediately after these prolonged apneas were also markedly reduced in amplitude. The larger the VT applied during the isocapnic CMV (120-200% of eupnea) and the longer the duration of the CMV (3-90 s), the longer the duration of the postventilator apnea. Significant postventilator apneas and postapneic hypoventilation also occurred even when end-tidal CO(2) pressure (PET(CO(2))) was raised 3-5 mm Hg > eupnea (and 7-10 mm Hg > normal apneic threshold) throughout CMV trials at raised frequency and VT. Our findings demonstrate that the increased frequency of CMV was critical to the elimination of inspiratory motor output and the onset of tonic expiratory muscle activity; furthermore, once EMG(di) was silenced, the tidal volume and duration of the passive mechanical ventilation determined the magnitude of the short-term inhibition of inspiratory motor output after cessation of CMV."

We aimed to determine whether and to what extent the QoL of OSAS patients using nCPAP differs from that of randomly selected subjects without this disorder. The QoL of 67 patients treated for at least 3 months with nCPAP, 21 OSAS patients at the time of OSAS diagnosis, and 113 randomly selected persons visiting the hospital (controls) was investigated with the help of the Munich life-quality dimension list (MLDL), an instrument for cognitive assessment of elementary components (physical condition, psyche, social life, everyday life) of QoL. It was found that QoL of OSAS patients treated with nCPAP did not significantly differ from that of control subjects with regard to elementary components. The 21 untreated OSAS patients showed significantly lower scores in all four subcategories: physical condition (p<0.0005), psyche (p<0.01), social life (p<0.0005) and everyday life (p<0.007). Thus, it may be concluded that nasal continuous positive airway pressure therapy has an important impact on the quality of life of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome patients, and signifies a further advantage in addition to clinical aspects.

Baroreflex and RSA gains increased whereas MER and CID gains decreased in compliant subjects whose average CPAP use was >3 h/night. In contrast, baroreflex, RSA, and MER gains remained unchanged and CID gain increased in noncompliant subjects. Other summary measures were unchanged in both groups, except for mean RR, which increased in compliant patients.

Standard therapy involves the use of a nasal continuous positive airway pressure device during sleep. This keeps the upper airway from collapsing, avoiding the cause of apneas and hypopneas. The inconvenience and side effects of the device make compliance with its use less than ideal. There are several surgical techniques that have been developed to correct OSA. These techniques have had variable success rates and are accompanied by some morbidity and mortality. Intraoral devices that position the mandible forward show promise for increasing the hypopharyngeal airway. A technique for physiologically determining an effective jaw relationship is described, as is a design for a device that maximizes nighttime retention.

Moreover, the prevalence of hypertension in patients with OSAS is high, between 35 and 80%. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to these complications are mainly due to intermittent hypoxia secondary to repeated episodes of apnoea/hypopnoea during sleep. These mechanisms include sympathetic hyperactivation, impairment of vasomotor reactivity, vascular inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic disorders. In patients with OSAS, the impact of continuous positive pressure is proven in terms of prevention of cardiovascular events although blood pressure reduction is limited. Obviously these effects are proportional to observance.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      OSAS does increase the cardiovascular risk, independently of other risk factors.

            "abstract": "It is often difficult to achieve adequate acceptance of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy by patients with OSA. Many patients find it particularly inconvenient to expire against the treatment pressure. With this in mind, we have attempted to improve acceptance of CPAP therapy by using a bilevel system that reduces the treatment pressure during expiration. 52 patients were randomized either to initial treatment with CPAP therapy followed by bilevel treatment, or to treatment in reversed order. During bilevel therapy the ratio of inspiratory to expiratory pressure was fixed at 1:0.6. After each treatment the patients were interviewed on the basis of visual analogue scales to establish their subjective evaluation of such parameters as general well-being, quality of sleep, comparison of the respective treatment pressures, and possible preference for one of the two systems for long-term treatment. The minimal effective inspiratory treatment pressure during bilevel therapy (IPAP) and the minimal effective CPAP pressure were closely correlated (r = 0.89). There was no difference between the apnoea hypopnoea indices during CPAP therapy as compared with bilevel therapy. Most patients (57%) felt the treatment pressure with the bilevel system to be lower (p = 0.048). There were no differences in patients' well-being early in the morning, or in their assessment of sleep quality. The majority of patients (52%) preferred bilevel therapy for long term treatment, while 38% preferred CPAP therapy (n.s.). In a subgroup of 13 patients with a treatment pressure of > or = 10 mbar during CPAP therapy 10 patients (77%) gave preference to the bilevel system (n.s.). In a considerable number of patients the acceptance of treatment can be improved by using a bilevel system for initiation of nasal positive pressure therapy."

            "abstract": "Elevated loop gain, consequent to hypersensitive ventilatory control, is a primary nonanatomical cause of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) but it is not possible to quantify this in the clinic. Here we provide a novel method to estimate loop gain in OSA patients using routine clinical polysomnography alone. We use the concept that spontaneous ventilatory fluctuations due to apnoeas/hypopnoeas (disturbance) result in opposing changes in ventilatory drive (response) as determined by loop gain (response/disturbance). Fitting a simple ventilatory control model (including chemical and arousal contributions to ventilatory drive) to the ventilatory pattern of OSA reveals the underlying loop gain. Following mathematical-model validation, we critically tested our method in patients with OSA by comparison with a standard (continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) drop method), and by assessing its ability to detect the known reduction in loop gain with oxygen and acetazolamide. Our method quantified loop gain from baseline polysomnography (correlation versus CPAP-estimated loop gain: n=28; r=0.63, p<0.001), detected the known reduction in loop gain with oxygen (n=11; mean±sem change in loop gain (ΔLG) -0.23±0.08, p=0.02) and acetazolamide (n=11; ΔLG -0.20±0.06, p=0.005), and predicted the OSA response to loop gain-lowering therapy. We validated a means to quantify the ventilatory control contribution to OSA pathogenesis using clinical polysomnography, enabling identification of likely responders to therapies targeting ventilatory control."

            "abstract": "We hypothesized that the increased arousal threshold to upper airway occlusion exhibited by patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is in part secondary to the disease process itself. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of withdrawal of three nights of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on arousal in six male patients with severe OSA who were using nasal CPAP on a long-term basis. During the control week, patients slept with nasal CPAP at home and on the first of 2 nights in the sleep laboratory (night C1, CPAP; night C2, no CPAP). During the apnea week, patients slept without nasal CPAP for 2 nights at home and 2 nights in the sleep laboratory (AP1, AP2). The control and apnea weeks were consecutive and in random order. The mean (+/-SEM) apnea+hypopnea index was 76.9 +/- 7.1 on AP1 vs 3.1 +/- 1.0 events per hour on C1 (p<0.05). Thus, the laboratory night (and presumably the 2 nights at home) preceding AP2 had dramatic increases in apnea compared with the nights preceding C2. The apnea duration during nonrapid eye movement sleep on nights following apnea was greater (AP2: 28.7 +/- 1.5 vs C2: 25.5 +/- 1. 7 s; p<0/05) and the arousal threshold as reflected by the maximum esophageal pressure deflection preceding arousal was higher (DPmax) (AP2: 55.1 +/- 5.7 vs C2: 45.3 +/- 6.4 cm H2O; p<0.005). We conclude that prior sleep apnea increases the arousal threshold to upper airway occlusion on subsequent nights and prolongs the apneic events."

We searched the PubMed database using the search terms \"CPAP\", \"mask\", and \"obstructive sleep apnea\". Although we identified 91 studies, only 12 described the impact of the type of CPAP interface on treatment effectiveness (n = 6) or adherence (n = 6). Despite conflicting results, we found no consistent evidence that nasal pillows and oral masks alter OSA treatment effectiveness or adherence. In contrast, most studies showed that oronasal masks are less effective and are more often associated with lower adherence and higher CPAP abandonment than are nasal masks.

All the studies had some shortcomings, such as small sample size, under-reporting of methods and data, and lack of blinding. Oral appliances versus control appliances (five studies): Oral appliances reduced daytime sleepiness in two crossover trials (WMD -1.81 [95%CI: -2.72, -0.90]), and improved apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) (-13.17 [-18.53 to -7.80] parallel group data - four studies). Oral appliances versus CPAP (seven studies): Oral appliances were less effective than continuous positive pressure in reducing apnoea-hypopnoea index (WMD 13 [95% CI: 7.63, 18.36], parallel studies - two trials; WMD 6.96 [4.82, 9.10] cross-over studies - six trials). However, no significant difference was observed on symptom scores. Nasal continuous positive pressure was more effective at improving minimum arterial oxygen saturation during sleep compared with oral appliance. In two small crossover studies, participants preferred oral appliance therapy to continuous positive airways pressure. Oral appliances versus surgery (one study): Symptoms of daytime sleepiness were initially lower with surgery, but this difference disappeared at 12 months. AHI did not differ significantly initially, but did so after 12 months in favour of OA.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewers' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is some evidence suggesting that oral appliance improves subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing compared with a control. Nasal continuous positive airways pressure appears to be more effective in improving sleep disordered breathing than oral appliance. Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of oral appliances, it would appear to be appropriate to restrict oral appliance therapy to patients with sleep apnoea who are unwilling or unable to comply with continuous positive airways pressure therapy."

            "abstract": "Large elastic arteries and smaller muscular conduit arteries become stiffer with ageing, a process that is accelerated in the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In recent years, numerous techniques have been developed to measure arterial stiffness, either in single vessels or in entire muscular arterial trees. These techniques have increasingly been shown to improve stratification of cardiovascular risk and risk reduction beyond that provided by conventional risk factors. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) has been increasingly linked with excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality however the mechanisms are still not well understood. Robustly designed studies have shown that treatment of OSA with nasal continuous positive airway pressure improves important intermediate risk factors for CVD including hypertension and endothelial function. More recently, there has been increased exploration of arterial stiffness in both cross-sectional and interventional studies in OSA patients. This review aims to give the reader a better understanding of the measurement and pathophysiology of arterial stiffness as well as providing an indication of how well a prognostic indicator are the various measures of arterial stiffness for hard cardiovascular endpoints. A critical appraisal is then provided of cross-sectional and interventional studies that have explored these same techniques in OSA populations."

            "abstract": "The role of chemical control instability in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is not clear. We studied 32 patients with OSA during sleep while their upper airway was stabilized with continuous positive airway pressure. Twelve patients had repetitive OSA whenever they were asleep, regardless of body position or sleep stage, and were classified as having severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI] = 88 +/- 19). The remaining 20 patients had sporadic OSA or repetitive OSA for only part of the time (mild/moderate OSA; AHI = 27 +/- 16). Susceptibility to periodic breathing (PB) was assessed by gradually increasing controller gain, using proportional assist ventilation. The increase in loop gain (LG) at each assist level was quantified from the ratio of assisted tidal volume (VT) to the VT obtained during single-breath reloading tests (VT amplification factor [VTAF]). Nine of 12 patients with severe OSA developed PB, with recurrent central apneas, whereas only six of 20 patients in the mild/moderate group developed PB (p < 0.02). This difference was observed despite the subjection of the mild/moderate group to greater amplification of LG; the highest values of VTAF in the mild/moderate and severe groups were 2.7 +/- 1.0 and 1.9 +/- 0.7, respectively (p < 0.01). We conclude that the chemical control system is more unstable in patients with severe OSA than in patients with milder OSA. We speculate that this may contribute to the severity of OSA, at least in some patients."

            "abstract": "We previously published a method for measuring several physiological traits causing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The method, however, had a relatively low success rate (76%) and required mathematical modeling, potentially limiting its application. This paper presents a substantial revision of that technique. To make the measurements, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was manipulated during sleep to quantify 1) eupneic ventilatory demand, 2) the level of ventilation at which arousals begin to occur, 3) ventilation off CPAP (nasal pressure = 0 cmH(2)O) when the pharyngeal muscles are activated during sleep, and 4) ventilation off CPAP when the pharyngeal muscles are relatively passive. These traits could be determined in all 13 participants (100% success rate). There was substantial intersubject variability in the reduction in ventilation that individuals could tolerate before having arousals (difference between ventilations #1 and #2 ranged from 0.7 to 2.9 liters/min) and in the amount of ventilatory compensation that individuals could generate (difference between ventilations #3 and #4 ranged from -0.5 to 5.5 liters/min). Importantly, the measurements accurately reflected clinical metrics; the difference between ventilations #2 and #3, a measure of the gap that must be overcome to achieve stable breathing during sleep, correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index (r = 0.9, P < 0.001). An additional procedure was added to the technique to measure loop gain (sensitivity of the ventilatory control system), which allowed arousal threshold and upper airway gain (response of the upper airway to increasing ventilatory drive) to be quantified as well. Of note, the traits were generally repeatable when measured on a second night in 5 individuals. This technique is a relatively simple way of defining mechanisms underlying OSA and could potentially be used in a clinical setting to individualize therapy."

The purpose of this study was to determine the specific effects of OSA on overall sleep architecture in a canine model of OSA. The advantage of this model is that sleep during long-term OSA can be compared to both normal sleep before OSA and recovery sleep after OSA. Studies were performed in four dogs in which sleep-wake state was monitored continuously by a computer that received telemetered EEG and EMG signals. Whenever sleep was detected, the computer sent a signal to close a valve through which the dog breathed; when the dog awoke the occlusion was released. In each dog, data were analyzed from 4 consecutive nights in three phases: a control phase before induction of OSA, a phase during long-term OSA (mean = 85 days, apnea index = 59/hour), and a recovery phase after cessation of OSA. During recovery there was a significant increase in the amount of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep compared to the OSA phase (p < 0.01), as well as significant increases in sleep efficiency and decreases in wakefulness (p < 0.01), similar to that reported in OSA patients. The REM rebound during recovery, however, could not be attributed to overall REM deprivation since the amount of REM sleep during the OSA phase was not different from the control phase (p = 0.708). This finding suggests that REM rebound during recovery from OSA is not the result of an overall REM sleep deficit per se. Rather, repeated sleep disruption due to the effects of repetitive apneas and hypoxia may lead to an increased REM sleep drive that manifests itself as a REM sleep rebound during recovery sleep after OSA."

Objective sleepiness, cognitive performance, and preference for treatments were not different. In patients experiencing a mild form of the syndrome (AHI < 15, n = 18), symptoms, treatment efficacy and satisfaction, and subjective sleepiness were also better with CPAP than with MRS (effect sizes, 0.7-1.1 SDs).

The aim of this study was to ascertain, in a large sample of CPAP-naive patients, whether CPAP titration performed by an unattended domiciliary autoadjusted CPAP device or with a predicted formula was as effective as CPAP titration performed by full polysomnography. The main outcomes were the apnea-hypopnea index and the subjective daytime sleepiness. We included 360 patients with SAHS requiring CPAP treatment. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups: standard, autoadjusted, and predicted formula titration with domiciliary adjustment. The follow-up period was 12 weeks. With CPAP treatment, the improvement in subjective sleepiness and apnea-hypopnea index was very similar in the three groups. There were no differences in the objective compliance of CPAP treatment and in the dropout rate of the three groups at the end of the follow-up.

Depending on selection criteria and quality of care, up to 50% of patients with OSA do not tolerate CPAP. For patients who cannot tolerate CPAP despite good quality care, pharmacological treatment would be a desirable alternative. The mechanisms by which pharmacological treatment is supposed to improve OSA include, amongst others, an augmentation in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone, an increase in ventilatory drive, a reduction in airway resistance and alterations in pharyngeal surface tension forces. In humans, most recent pharmacological approaches to the treatment of OSA in clinical trials have focused on modulating serotoninergic and cholinergic activities, as both have been shown to augment pharyngeal dilator muscle tone. However, currently there is not enough evidence to recommend any particular drug treatment for OSA. Methodological issues of published clinical trials on pharmacological OSA treatment make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions and inform further drug developments in this area. In this article, the pitfalls of clinical trials on pharmacological OSA therapy are summarised and potential solutions and directions for future studies are given."

Peff was then determined according to the percentage of CPAP time that was spent </= Pref. This Peff value was set on a fixed CPAP machine for two additional weeks and a control sleep study was done. The pressure setting on fixed CPAP had to be increased by 1 +/- 1 cm H(2)O (mean +/- SD) above estimated Pref. Sleep improved with fixed CPAP, with a normalization of the apnea + hypopnea index (AHI) in 38 of 40 and resumption of diurnal hypersomnolence. CPAP compliance remained excellent (CPAP use: 6.1 +/- 1.7 h/ night) after 6.5 +/- 2.8 mo of CPAP treatment. These results indicate that auto-CPAP therapy represents a new useful and accurate way to identify conventional CPAP setting outside hospital and sleep laboratories."

            "abstract": "The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of a mandibular advancement appliance (MAA) for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Ninety-three patients with OSA and a mean apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) of 34.7 were centrally randomised into three, parallel groups: (a) MAA; (b) mandibular non-advancement appliance (MNA); and (c) no intervention. The appliances were custom made, in one piece. The MAAs had a mean protrusion of the mandible of 74% (range 64-85%). Outcome measures, assessed after continuous use for 4 weeks, were AHI (polysomnography), daytime sleepiness (Epworth) and quality of life (SF-36). Eighty-one patients (87%) completed the trial. The MAA group achieved mean AHI and Epworth scores significantly lower (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) than the MNA group and the no-intervention group. No significant differences were found between the MNA group and the no-intervention group. The MAA group had a mean AHI reduction of 14.1 (95% CI 7.4-20.8), and a mean Epworth score reduction of 3.3 (95% CI 1.8-4.8). Eight MAA patients (30%) achieved a reduction in AHI > or = 75% ending with an AHI < 5, half of them having baseline AHI > 30. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. MAA had a significant beneficial effect on the vitality domain of SF-36. Four MAA patients (14.8%) and two MNA patients (8%) discontinued interventions because of adverse effects. Our conclusion is that MAA has significant beneficial effects on OSA, including cure in some cases of severe OSA. Protrusion of the mandible is essential for the effect. MNA has no placebo effect. MAA may be a good alternative to CPAP in subsets of OSA patients."

We determined the effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in reducing fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in OSA patients. Methods. Thirteen patients with OSA and 13 normal controls were recruited. FeNO and MDA levels were measured in the controls and in OSA patients before and after three months of CPAP therapy. Results. FeNO and MDA levels were higher in the patients compared to the age and gender matched controls (FeNO: 25.9 ± 5.0 versus 17.5 ± 5.9 ppb, P < 0.001; MDA: 14.6 ± 7.8 versus 2.1 ± 0.3 μmol/L, P < 0.001).

Apnea-hypopnea index (15.9 ± 6.6 versus 4.1 ± 2.1/h, P < 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (P < 0.01) decreased following CPAP treatment. Daytime mean SpO2 (P < 0.05) increased. Conclusion. Our study demonstrates that CPAP therapy yields clinical benefits by reducing upper airway inflammation and oxidative stress in OSA patients."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with serious comorbid illnesses and diminished quality of life. At this time, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy is the treatment of choice. However, only half of those individuals who accept CPAP are still using it at the end of one year. Furthermore, efficacy for improving self-reported sleepiness appears to be greater for patients with severe sleep apnea and severe sleepiness than other patient groups. Some patients, notwithstanding optimized therapy and therapeutic adherence continue experiencing excessive daytime somnolence. Consequently, other treatment modalities have developed, including oral appliances, surgery and pharmacotherapy. It is widely believed, albeit not empirically demonstrated, that an effective medication to treat OSA would elicit better acceptance and adherence than having to use a machine for many hours on a nightly basis. Nonetheless, paucity of data (i.e. lack of large-scale randomized controlled trials), variability of perceived and actual benefits, and adverse side-effects of the drugs thus far tested have prevented the use of pharmacotherapy until now. In this paper we review the outcome data from published trials designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of various medications proposed for treating obstructive sleep apnea."

Pulmonary complications of heart failure include loss of surfactant, increased pulmonary dry weight and reduced lung volume, which are likely to increase plant gain and thus predispose to central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration. Upper airway narrowing in normal individuals has been shown to occur with lower limb compression and the supine body position, thus suggesting that rostral fluid shifts may narrow the upper airway and aggravate obstructive sleep apnea. Extrapolating this to congestive heart failure (CHF), it is possible that CHF fluid status may impact upon obstructive sleep apnea severity. Following the Canadian Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for Patients with Central Sleep Apnoea and Heart Failure trial, further SDB intervention studies have been reported using adaptive servo-ventilation. Although encouraging, small, short-term studies are discussed, however long-term randomized trials with objective cardiac outcomes are still lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      The relationship between CHF and SDB is likely to be bidirectional, CHF impacting on SDB severity and vice versa.

            "title": "Oral appliance therapy for obstructive sleep apnea.",
            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder characterized by repetitive, complete or partial closure of the upper airway during sleep, resulting in sleep fragmentation and oxygen desaturation. The disorder causes significant morbidity, particularly in terms of impairment of daytime functioning and the impact this has on quality of life. There is also evidence that links OSA to long-term cardiovascular morbidity, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. There is clear evidence that effective treatment of OSA provides major benefit to patients. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the current treatment of choice, but its cumbersome nature makes tolerance and compliance less than optimal. This gives rise to the need for other alternatives that are equally effective, but more tolerable. There is growing interest in the use of oral appliances to treat snoring and OSA. The rationale is that advancement of the mandible and tongue impacts positively on upper airway caliber and function. There are many such types of appliances, and they have potential advantages over CPAP in that they are unobtrusive, make no noise, do not need a power source, and are potentially less costly. There is a growing evidence base to support the use of oral appliances in the management of OSA. Recent evidence from randomized controlled trials indicates that oral appliance therapy is effective in controlling OSA in up to 50% of patients, including some patients with more severe forms of OSA. This is associated with a significant improvement in symptoms, including snoring and daytime sleepiness. This evidence is strong for short term, and emerging for long-term treatment of OSA with oral appliances. Whilst direct comparisons with CPAP indicate the superiority of CPAP overall, similar outcomes between the two treatments appear to be achieved in a substantial subgroup of patients. Patient acceptance has, in general, been in favor of oral appliances. Notwithstanding the expanding role of oral appliance therapy, there are a number of limitations that are yet to be overcome. Key issues include the inability to reliably predict treatment outcome, the apparent need for an acclimatization period to attain maximal efficacy of treatment, uncertainty about selection of the appropriate 'dosage' of mandibular advancement required to control OSA in the individual patient, uncertainty about the influence of appliance design on treatment outcome and adverse effects, adherence to treatment, and potential long-term complications of therapy. These issues require resolution before oral appliance therapy can surpass CPAP as first-line treatment for OSA."

Only three patients presented a dipper nocturnal pressure pattern. CPAP treatment significantly reduced SBP (-5.2 mmHg), and particularly the nocturnal values (-6.1 mmHg), but not DBP. Considering only those patients who tolerated CPAP, the decrease in SBP was greater (-7.3 mmHg). Furthermore, CPAP treatment significantly increased the percentage of patients who recovered the dipper pattern (three (9.1%) out of 33 versus 12 (36.4%) out of 33). Continuous positive airway pressure treatment significantly reduces systolic blood pressure, particularly at night, and normalises the nocturnal pressure pattern in patients with difficult-to-control hypertension and sleep apnoea."

            "abstract": "This article is a review of the current evidence that links systemic hypertension with obstructive sleep apnoea. Whilst a causal association has been suspected for some time, the day to day variability of both blood pressure and sleep apnoea severity, and clustering of confounding cardiovascular risk factors in sleep apnoea patients has made this association difficult to prove. There is unassailable evidence that obstructive apnoeas raise blood pressure acutely in both animal models and humans, through a combination of autonomic and state dependent arousal with some mechanical influences, and these rises can be controlled by nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Thus, although repetitive apnoeas alter the blood pressure variability and raise sleeping blood pressure in patients with OSA and sophisticated animal models have demonstrated increases in daytime blood pressure after the onset of OSA in the short term, such effects on diurnal BP have yet to be proven in humans. Recent rigorously designed large epidemiological studies have proven an independent association between OSA and systemic hypertension in both general and sleep clinic populations, with closely matched case control series also reporting raised blood pressure in OSA patients. A direct temporal causal association between the onset of obstructive sleep apnoea and raised blood pressure is expected to be confirmed by longitudinal data from the continuing epidemiological population studies. Finally, several studies on the beneficial effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure in reducing blood pressure in OSA patients have preliminary results in abstract form, with one published in full."

            "abstract": "Dyslipidaemia and increased oxidative stress have been reported in severe obstructive sleep apnea, and both may be related to the development of cardiovascular disease. We have previously shown in a randomized crossover study in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea that therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure treatment for 8 weeks improved postprandial triglycerides and total cholesterol when compared with sham continuous positive airway pressure. From this study we have now compared the effect of 8 weeks of therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure and sham continuous positive airway pressure on oxidative lipid damage and plasma lipophilic antioxidant levels. Unesterified cholesterol, esterified unsaturated fatty acids (cholesteryl linoleate: C18:2; and cholesteryl arachidonate: C20:4; the major unsaturated and oxidizable lipids in low-density lipoproteins), their corresponding oxidized products [cholesteryl ester-derived lipid hydroperoxides and hydroxides (CE-O(O)H)] and antioxidant vitamin E were assessed at 20:30 hours before sleep, and at 06:00 and 08:30 hours after sleep. Amongst the 29 patients completing the study, three had incomplete or missing [CE-O(O)H] data. The mean apnea -hypopnoea index, age and body mass index were 38 per hour, 49 years and 32 kg m(-2) , respectively. No differences in lipid-based oxidative markers or lipophilic antioxidant levels were observed between the continuous positive airway pressure and sham continuous positive airway pressure arms at any of the three time-points [unesterified cholesterol 0.01 mm, P > 0.05; cholesteryl linoleate: C18:2 0.05 mm, P > 0.05; cholesteryl arachidonate: C20:4 0.02 mm, P = 0.05; CE-O(O)H 2.5 nm, P > 0.05; and lipid-soluble antioxidant vitamin E 0.03 μm, P > 0.05].

Patients were prospectively followed with sleep studies, spirometry and peak inspiratory muscle pressure. Ten patients were studied before and after 3 nights withdrawal from NIV. NIV normalised nocturnal gas exchange in all patients and diurnal gas exchange in patients with ventilatory insufficiency. The effects persisted over 25.3 +/- 12.7 months. Nocturnal transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide improved from (baseline versus latest control) 7.1 +/- 1.3 to 5.5 +/- 0.6 kPa (53.7 +/- 9.9 to 41.6 +/- 4.8 mmHg), diurnal carbon dioxide arterial tension from 6.3 +/- 1.6 to 5.4 +/- 0.5 kPa (47.5 +/- 11.9 to 40.6 +/- 3.6 mmHg). NIV improved respiratory disturbance index, arousals from sleep, nocturnal heart rate and sleep architecture. Vital capacity decreased in five adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy -183 +/- 111 mL x yr(-1) but remained stable in 25 children with other conditions (8 +/- 78 mL x yr(-1)). Three nights withdrawal of NIV in 10 previously stable patients resulted in prompt deterioration of SDB and gas exchange back to baseline but could be instantly normalised by resumption of NIV. Noninvasive (positive-pressure) ventilation has favourable long-term impact on nocturnal and diurnal gas exchange and sleep and in patients with non-Duchenne neuromuscular disorders on vital capacity as well. It is indicated in children and adolescents with symptomatic sleep-disordered breathing or ventilatory insufficiency due to neuromuscular disorders."

We tested the hypothesis that respiratory–sympathetic coupling, postulated to be the underlying cause of neurogenic hypertension, is increased in OSA. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity, blood pressure, ECG and respiration were recorded in 21 normotensive control subjects and 21 newly diagnosed patients with OSA before and after 6 and 12 months of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was recorded via tungsten microelectrodes inserted percutaneously into the peroneal nerve. Cardiac and respiratory modulation of MSNA was quantified from the cross-correlation histograms constructed between the sympathetic spikes and either ECG or respiration. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity was significantly elevated in newly diagnosed OSA patients compared with control subjects (53 ± 2 versus 28 ± 2 bursts min−1). There was a significant fall in MSNA after 6 months of continuous positive airway pressure (37 ± 2 bursts min−1), with no further change after 12 months (37 ± 2 bursts min−1). There were no significant differences in the magnitude of respiratory modulation of MSNA between the OSA patients and control subjects (40 ± 3.1 versus 39 ± 3.4%). However, when considering the normalized temporal profile there were changes in the respiratory patterning of MSNA in OSA, with more activity occurring in postinspiration and less in inspiration and expiration.

Whether CPAP also acutely affects BRS during sleep in uncomplicated severe OSA is still debatable. Blood pressure was monitored during nocturnal polysomnography in 18 patients at baseline and during first-time CPAP application. Spontaneous BRS was analysed by the sequence method, and estimated as the mean sequence slope. CPAP did not acutely affect mean blood pressure or heart rate but decreased cardiovascular variability during sleep. Mean BRS increased slightly during CPAP application (from 6.5+/-2.4 to 7.5+/-2.9 ms x mmHg(-1)), mostly in response to decreasing blood pressure. The change in BRS did not correlate with changes in arterial oxygen saturation or apnoea/hypopnoea index. The small change in baroreflex control of heart rate during sleep at first application of continuous positive airway pressure in severe obstructive sleep apnoea was unrelated to the acute resolution of nocturnal hypoxaemia, and might reflect autonomic adjustments to positive intrathoracic pressure, and/or improved sleep architecture. The small increase in baroreflex control of heart rate during sleep may be of clinical relevance as it was accompanied by reduced cardiovascular variability, which is acknowledged as an independent cardiovascular risk factor."

            "abstract": "We investigated the mechanisms of the beneficial effect derived from progesterone therapy for sleep apnea syndrome (SAS). Nine patients with SAS were treated for 7 days with chlormadinone acetate (CMA), a respiratory stimulant known to increase not only CO2 and hypoxic chemosensitivity but also respiratory drive response for ventilatory loading. They were examined as to sleep events and ventilatory control during wakefulness before and during CMA treatment. Apnea-hypopnea index was significantly reduced from 51.1 +/- 5.7 to 43.6 +/- 8.1 episodes/h (p less than 0.05). The ratio of desaturation time with more than 4% SaO2 fall to total sleep time was diminished in seven of nine patients, and its mean value decreased from 44.9 +/- 8.6 to 28.7 +/- 8.1% (p less than 0.05). Both hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) and load response during wakefulness were significantly increased, although isocapnic hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) was not significantly enhanced by CMA. The degree of augmentation in awake load response as well as in HCVR was positively correlated with that of improvement in sleep-disordered breathing. Moreover, patients who did not show amelioration in oxygen desaturation were found to be incapable of increasing load response despite increased HCVR. We conclude that CMA therapy for sleep apnea syndrome is effective in the patients whose load response as well as respiratory control activity are augmented during wakefulness."

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) ventilation is the gold standard in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Long-term compliance rates do not exceed more than 60 to 70%. Alternative multi-level surgeries are of interest, combining procedures at the level of the base of tongue and the soft palate in order to stabilize the airway. Preliminary results suggested the hyoid suspension as one part of the multi-level surgery concept to be of high effectiveness. Therefore this study investigated the outcome of the hyoid suspension and compared it with the CPAP therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Between March 2001 and February 2003, 66 patients with OSA were treated with a hyoid suspension in combination with surgeries at the base of tongue, the soft palate or the nose (always performed by the same surgeon). All patients underwent a pre- and postoperative polysomnography in the sleep lab. Daytime sleepiness was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Mean age was 52,1 years, the mean body mass index (BMI) was 28,04 kg/m(2).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean apnea-hypopnea-index (AHI) was 38,9121,10/h before operation and 19,25+/-19,64/h after operation (p<0,0001). More statistically significant changes were found for the arousal index, the oxygen saturation and the ESS (p<0,05). After surgery 57,6% of the subjects (38/66) were regarded as cured (reduction of AHI > or =50% and below 15/h). Another 21,2% (14/66) improved (reduction of AHI >20%). Altogether 78,8% of the patients were counted as responders.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Multi-level surgeries based on the hyoid suspension show the effectiveness of this concept.

This study aimed to investigate whether OSA patients without heart morbidity develop LV dysfunction, and to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on LV function. Twenty-nine OSA patients and 12 control subjects were studied using technetium-99m ventriculography to estimate LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV peak emptying rate (LVPER), time to peak emptying rate (TPER), peak filling rate (LVPFR) and time to peak filling rate (TPFR) before and after 6 months of treatment with CPAP. A significantly lower LVEF was found in OSA patients, compared to control subjects, (53+/-7 versus 61+/-6%) along with a reduced LVPER (2.82+/-0.58 versus 3.82+/-0.77 end-diastolic volumes x s(-1)). Furthermore, OSA patients had significantly lower LVPFR (2.67+/-0.71 versus 3.93+/-0.58 end-diastolic volumes x s(-1)) and delayed TPFR (0.19+/-0.04 versus 0.15+/-0.03 s) in comparison with the control group. Six-months of CPAP treatment was effective in significantly improving LVEF, LVPER, LVPFR and TPFR.

            "abstract": "The majority of patients with heart failure have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)-with central (rather than obstructive) sleep apnoea becoming the predominant form in those with more severe disease. Cyclical apnoeas and hypopnoeas are associated with sleep disturbance, hypoxaemia, haemodynamic changes, and sympathetic activation. Such patients have a worse prognosis than those without SDB. Mask-based therapies of positive airway pressure targeted at SDB can improve measures of sleep quality and partially normalise the sleep and respiratory physiology, but recent randomised trials of cardiovascular outcomes in central sleep apnoea have been neutral or suggested the possibility of harm, likely from increased sudden death. Further randomised outcome studies (with cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation endpoints) are required to determine whether mask-based treatment for SDB is appropriate for patients with chronic systolic heart failure and obstructive sleep apnoea, for those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and for those with decompensated heart failure. New therapies for sleep apnoea-such as implantable phrenic nerve stimulators-also require robust assessment. No longer can the surrogate endpoints of improvement in respiratory and sleep metrics be taken as adequate therapeutic outcome measures in patients with heart failure and sleep apnoea."

At 3 to 6 months (K1), 1 to 2 years (K2) and more than 3 years (K3) patients were reexamined regarding clinical conditions, the mean time of nCPAP usage per night, nCPAP pressure, and body mass index (BMI). The regularly conducted controls consisted of checking mask fitting, polygraphy with automatic pressure titration and once, mostly at K1, polysomnography. Compliance with nCPAP was considered to be sufficient more than 4 hours of usage per night. At K1, 9 patients had stopped therapy, 5 had moved away, 6 had changed therapy, 6 had died, and 41 had not been treated long enough to have a follow-up at K1. Thus we were able to reexamine 119 patients with ongoing nCPAP therapy. We found no correlation between indices of severeness of sleep apnoea (apnoea/hypopnea index, mean low of night time oxygen saturation, nCPAP pressure, and BMI) and compliance. At K1 87 patients (73%) had sufficient nCPAP compliance. All of them showed sufficient compliance at K2 and K3 too. We conclude that a sufficient compliance at an initial control implies sufficient compliance later on. 32 patients (27%) showed insufficient compliance at K1. Of this group 41% (13 patients) improved compliance at K2. This result underlines the value of a second instruction in nCPAP therapy when patient compliance was lacking initially."

Though some OSA patients adhere to treatment recommendations and ultimately respond quite well to CPAP therapy, there is a substantial subgroup for which compliance is a particularly difficult issue. Despite receiving recommendations to the contrary and for reasons that are incompletely understood, the majority of OSA patients settle for a partial compliance pattern. Whether a partial compliance schedule is beneficial or harmful is virtually unexamined: Unlike other medical treatments, there are few data concerning the \"dose-response relationship\" of CPAP to its desired effects. We argue that CPAP \"dose\" is a function not only of CPAP pressure but of time-on-CPAP as well. Critical questions that remain unanswered are what \"dose\" of CPAP is needed to effect an appropriate treatment outcome and which treatment outcomes should form the basis of our recommendations. Recent placebo-controlled studies comparing CPAP to suboptimal CPAP pressures may be informative in this regard. Directions for future research are suggested."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSA) increases the risk of motor vehicle crashes, and of all medical disorders, has greatest risk in this respect. There is no consistency in the way OSA is considered by the national 'Physical Fitness to Drive' legislations within the 27 member countries of the European Union (EU), and most ignore OSA. This is further reflected by the absence of any reference to OSA in Annex III of the Directive 91/439/EEC, harmonizing Driving License regulations in the EU. A recent meeting brought together experts from several European and other countries, together with a representative of the European Commission. They discussed the best way to design and implement a uniform policy within Europe, for OSA and driving. It was agreed that: (i) other forms of pathological sleepiness be included, (ii) it covers both private and professional drivers, (iii) police accident report forms should explicitly consider sleepiness as a potential cause, (iv) sleep-wake education should be incorporated into the mandatory program of continuous education for professional drivers, ideally from 2010, (v) driver screening methods should contain questions on sleepiness at the wheel, habitual snoring and witnessed apneas during sleep, as well as the Epworth Sleepiness Score and Body Mass Index and (vi) following effective and efficient treatment, patients should be permitted to drive. In the light of medical, scientific and technical progress, EU procedures exist to enable the rapid modification of existing legislation. If such a procedure could be enacted for these aspects of driver sleepiness, then roads would be safer for 400 million people."

            "abstract": "We studied five patients with chronic stable congestive heart failure (CHF), all of whom demonstrated recurrent apneas in association with Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSR) during sleep. All five patients had symptoms consistent with a sleep apnea syndrome. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) was administered at 8 to 12.5 cm H2O to all patients during sleep. The number of apneas fell from (mean +/- SE) 60 +/- 12/h of sleep on the control night to 9 +/- 7/h of sleep (p less than 0.01) on the NCPAP night, whereas mean nocturnal SaO2 rose from 88 +/- 2% on the control night to 92 +/- 2% (p less than 0.025) while on NCPAP. This was associated with resolution of symptoms of sleep apnea. In addition, resting left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as measured by radionuclide angiography (RNA) rose from 31 +/- 8% while off NCPAP to 38 +/- 10% (p less than 0.05) while on NCPAP. Furthermore, all five patients experienced marked improvement in symptoms of heart failure from functional classes III and IV (New York Heart Association Classification) prior to NCPAP therapy to class II after NCPAP therapy was instituted. We conclude that, in certain patients, CSR during sleep associated with chronic CHF constitutes a sleep apnea syndrome, which can be alleviated by NCPAP. In addition, NCPAP therapy may lead to a reduction in cardiac dyspnea and improvement in left ventricular function."

Clinical and bench tests of these devices have suggested performance limitations. These studies do not indicate whether this is a failure to detect or a failure to respond to airway obstruction. In this randomised, crossover trial, 34 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA underwent polysomnography on two laboratory visits.

Airflow was measured both from the autoCPAP (autoCPAP flow) and directly from the nasal mask, and recorded on polysomnography. Apnoea/hypopnoea indices (AHIs) measured at the two sites and from the autoCPAP download report were compared. Regarding detection, the AHI measured from the nasal mask showed good agreement with the autoCPAP flow AHI, but agreement was lower with the autoCPAP report AHI. In autotitrating mode, there was significant misclassification of those with and without OSA (AHI ≥ 10 events · h(-1)) on the autoCPAP report. Regarding response, residual OSA (AHI ≥ 10 events · h(-1)) was still evident in 24% of patients during autotitration. In some patients, autoCPAP fails to detect and/or respond to sleep apnoea. Clinicians should consider limitations of each device and use caution when using autoCPAP report statistics to verify effective treatment."

            "abstract": "Mask fitting and accommodation of CPAP-devices are of great importance. Only by accommodation over several hours, problems concerning mask size and fixation of mask are recognised and solved. Many patients overestimate the time they needed for achieving accommodation. We therefore asked whether by visualizing the time required for accommodation the accommodation time can be prolonged. Additionally we compared the subjective estimation on the time with the objectively measured time. We studied 20 patients with sleep apnoea syndrome, 13 men and 7 women, age 53 +/- 4 years, apnoea/hypopnoea index 32 +/- 16, lowest O2 saturation 83 +/- 6%. In a randomized cross-over study, a clock with a large 7 segment-display was either not visible in one setting, so that the patient had no control of the training-time, or the time was visible on the display. Thus the patient could possibly be motivated to increase his time of CPAP-accommodation during the day. The pressure-controlled clock counted only the time during which the pressure was above 4 HPa. In the setting with visible time-counter the accommodation time was 265.8 +/- 114 min, if the counter was not visible, time was only 210.8 +/- 91 min. If the patient cannot observe the time-counter he over-estimates the objectively measured time by half an hour (247.2 +/- 97.5 estimated vs. 210.8 +/- 91.0 actually). Thus the self-control of CPAP-accommodation by a visible clock leads to a significant prolongation of the exercise time. The estimation by the patient is only a limited means to evaluate the time of CPAP accommodation during the day."

Recently, machines that automatically titrate the effective nCPAP pressure have become available. The question now is, whether and how they work and what the benefits and limitations of such devices are. The algorithms that control the machines are quite different and so is their effectiveness. Even in devices that generally work well, there may be some principal limitations. The algorithm may be mislead by artefacts, especially leaks. Apnoeas and arousal may occur because the pressure increase is too slow or breathing disturbances reoccur after a pressure decrease. Autotitrating nasal continuous positive airway pressure may reduce the work required to determine effective pressure. It is a valuable treatment option for patients who need high and variable nasal continuous positive airway pressure. It should not be used as an unattended pressure titration tool because this will lead to a loss of quality in patient care and a reduced acceptance of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, as pressure determination is only a small part of the adaptation of the patient to nasal continuous positive airway pressure."

Negative pressure ventilators may be partially effective in these patients but can cause upper airway obstructive apneas. We examined the effectiveness of positive pressure ventilation through a nose mask in preventing nocturnal hypoxemia and compared it with negative pressure systems. We reasoned that nasal positive pressure would provide stability for the upper airway. Five patients with neuromuscular disorders underwent a series of all-night sleep studies under control conditions, negative pressure ventilation, and positive pressure ventilation through a comfortable nose mask. Sleep staging and respiratory variables were monitored during all studies. Daytime awake lung function, respiratory muscle strength, and arterial blood gases were also measured. The severe hypoxemia and hypercapnia that occurred under control conditions were prevented by positive pressure ventilation through a nose mask. Negative pressure ventilation improved NREM ventilation in all patients, but did not prevent severe oxyhemoglobin desaturation, which occurred during REM sleep. Negative pressure ventilation appears to contribute to upper airways obstruction during REM sleep as evidenced by cessation of air flow, reduced chest wall movements, falls in arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation, and hypercapnia. With treatment, daytime PaO2 improved from a mean of 70 to 83 mm Hg, and PaCO2 decreased from a mean of 61 to 46 mm Hg. We conclude that nasally applied positive pressure ventilation is a highly effective method of providing nocturnal assisted ventilation because it stabilizes the oropharyngeal airway."

            "abstract": "In patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), sleep disordered breathing (SDB)--including obstructive and central sleep apnoea as well as periodic breathing--is a common condition and is believed to increase the risk of mortality. Treatment of SDB is considered important in the management of CHF. Improvements in SDB have a positive effect on cardiac output, measured with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF); on neurohormonal activity, measured as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP); and on the quality of life. Continuous positive airway pressure has been the traditional method used to treat SDB in patients with CHF, but compliance and tolerability are poor. A mandibular advancement device (MAD) is a dental device recommended for the treatment of sleep apnoea, but the method has never been evaluated in patients with CHF. The aims of the present studies were to evaluate the practical use of the MAD for the treatment of SDB in patients with CHF and to test the hypothesis that this intervention increases the dimensions of the pharyngeal airway (PAW), reduces SDB and BNP, and improves LVEF and the quality of life. Patients with mild to moderate CHF and SDB were evaluated using a portable polysomnographic device, lateral radiographs, cardiological and odontological examinations, and quality of life measures prior to and following intervention with an custom-made MAD. At the short-term follow-up 4-6 weeks after habituation with the MAD, the severity of SDB according to the apnoea-hypopnoea index had decreased from 25.1 +/- 9.4 (mean +/- SD) to 14.7 +/- 9.7 (p = 0.003). An increase in the inferior region of the PAW (7 +/- 5 mm) was observed on radiographs (p = 0.0001). However, no correlation between the effect of the MAD on the dimensions of the PAW and its effect on SDB was found. At the 6-month follow-up, the sleep apnoea-related symptoms had decreased by 31% (p = 0.003). Quality of life remained stable. BNP were reduced from 195.8 +/- 180.5 pg/ml to 148.1 +/- 139.9 pg/ml (p = 0.035). LVEF, however, remained unchanged. At the 12-month follow-up, 64 % of the patients were still using the MAD. Three patients withdrew from the study because of discomfort with the MAD. In most patients, MAD treatment had no severe side effect on the signs or symptoms of temporomandibular disorders. However, dental complications were observed. In conclusion, in patients with stable CHF who are experiencing problems with SDB, MAD intervention appears to reduce the severity of SDB, sleep apnoea-related symptoms, and neurohormonal activity. A lower tendency for PAW collapse may explain the effect observed on SDB. The reduction in plasma BNP may indicate decreased cardiac strain as a result of treatment of SDB. The 5-year survival rate, measured from the start of MAD intervention, was higher in the group that used a MAD than in the group that did not use a MAD (p = 0.036). No severe side effects on the stomatognathic system were observed during the intervention, and most patients--edentulous included--tolerated the treatment well. Impaired oral health, including reduced dentition and edentulousness, seemed to limit the use of the MAD in this group of elderly patients, both because of technical difficulties and because of the increased risk of dental complications. However, because the treatment of SDB is important in the management of CHF, the MAD intervention seems to be a valuable method in the treatment arsenal of SDB."

            "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the degree and duration of respiratory stimulation caused by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), and compare the effect of MPA to that of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in sleep-disordered breathing. Ten postmenopausal females with predominantly partial upper airway obstruction during sleep had an overnight sleep study at baseline, on the fourteenth day of treatment with MPA and after a 3-week washout period. Six subjects on nCPAP were also studied 3 months later. At baseline, the overnight mean+/-SD end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide (Pet,CO2) was 5.5+/-0.4 kPa the arterial oxygen saturation (Sa,O2) 93.0+/-1.2%, Sa,O2 nadir 80.0+/-6.7%, and frequency of oxygen desaturation > or = 4% (ODI4) per hour 2.2+/-1.3. MPA decreased Pet,CO2 by 0.8 kPa (14.5%, p<0.001). After washout, the mean Pet,CO2 remained at 0.5 kPa (9.1%, p<0.001) lower than at baseline. Sa,O2 did not change. Pet,CO2 was lower on MPA than on nCPAP (4.7+/-0.2 kPa versus 5.0+/-0.3 kPa; p=0.037) but Sa,O2 was similar. Apnoea/hypopnoea index tended to be lower on CPAP than on MPA. Medroxyprogesterone acetate at a daily dose of 60 mg improves ventilation in postmenopausal females with partial upper airway obstruction during sleep without compromising sleep. The ventilatory improvement is sustained for at least 3 weeks posttreatment. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was more efficient in decreasing the partial pressure of carbon dioxide but continuous positive airway pressure was superior in decreasing respiratory efforts."

            "abstract": "While many physiological control models exist in the literature, none thus far has focused on characterizing the interactions among the respiratory, cardiovascular and sleep-wake regulation systems that occur in sleep-disordered breathing. The model introduced in this study integrates the autonomic control of the cardiovascular system, chemoreflex and state-related control of respiration, including respiratory and upper airway mechanics, along with a model of circadian and sleep-wake regulation. The integrative model provides realistic predictions of the physiological responses under a variety of conditions including: the sleep-wake cycle, hypoxia-induced periodic breathing, Cheyne-Stokes respiration in chronic heart failure, and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It can be used to investigate the effects of a variety of interventions, such as isocapnic and hypercapnic and/or hypoxic gas administration, the Valsalva and Mueller maneuvers, and the application of continuous positive airway pressure on OSA subjects. By being able to delineate the influences of the various interacting physiological mechanisms, the model is useful in providing a more lucid understanding of the complex dynamics that characterize state-cardiorespiratory control in the different forms of sleep-disordered breathing."

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of 1 year CPAP therapy on CO(2) drive in 20 OSA patients. The slope of HCVR (SHCVR) changed from 2.35+/-0.21 L min(-1) mmHg(-1) (control) to 1.66+/-0.16 L min(-1) mm Hg(-1) (P=0.04), but the mean within subject coefficient of variation in repeated measurements of SHCVR in treated and untreated OSA patients was not statistically different.

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a rather common chronic disorder, associated with increased prevalence of hypertension. The pathophysiological mechanisms for hypertension in OSA are at least in part linked to intermittent hypoxia developed during nightly hypopneas and apneas. Hypoxemia stimulates sympathetic overactivity, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction. However, it appears that intermittent hypoxemia is not the only factor in the development of hypertension in OSA. Supplemental oxygen therapy that improved oxyhemoglobin saturation to similar levels to those achieved with CPAP treatment did not reduce BP. In this scenario, it could be proposed that hypoxemia acts as a trigger of sympathetic overdrive, which when set is the main factor in the development of hypertension in OSA. This review appraises evidence provided by randomized controlled trials on the BP-lowering effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of OSA patients with nonresistant and resistant hypertension. It suggests that CPAP treatment is more effective in treating resistant hypertension than nonresistant hypertension. A possible explanation is that sympathetic overactivity and altered vascular reactivity in OSA could be more severe in resistant hypertension than in nonresistant hypertension. An intricate interaction among compliance, adherence, and their interaction with demographic characteristics, genetic factors, and comorbidities of the population included might explain the differences found between trials on their influence over the antihypertensive effectiveness of CPAP. Further long-term trials are needed in hypertensive OSA patients to assess whether CPAP treatment in OSA patients consistently restores physiological nocturnal BP fall and adjusts resting and circadian heart rate."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSA) is a disease very frequently occurring in people with type 2 diabetes, that significantly increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In a number of studies, OSA has been identified as an independent risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Disorders of glucose homeostasis in patients with OSA are probably mediated by chronic intermittent hypoxia and/or sleep fragmentation through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis, pro-inflammatory paths or oxidative stress. Despite the high prevalence of OSA among patients with type 2 diabetes as well as the proven benefit of the continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on reduction of mortality, most patients with OSA remain undiagnosed. Active OSA screening should therefore be performed in all patients with type 2 diabetes, ideally through home monitoring of oxygen saturation and breathing during sleep. Although the effect of CPAP therapy on the improvement in diabetes control (decrease in glycated hemoglobin) has not been clearly proven in patients with type 2 diabetes so far, promising outcomes have been observed during the treatment of patients with prediabetes.Key words: CPAP - diabetes mellitus - glycemic control - intermittent hypoxia - obstructive sleep apnoea - screening - sleep fragmentation."

            "abstract": "Adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a critical problem. Poor adherence (30-60%) to CPAP is widely recognized as a significant limiting factor in treating OSA, reducing the overall effectiveness of the treatment and leaving many OSA patients at heightened risk for co-morbid conditions, impaired function and quality of life. The extant literature examining adherence to CPAP provides critical insight to measuring adherence outcomes, defining optimal adherence levels, and predicting CPAP adherence. This research has revealed salient factors that are associated with or predict CPAP adherence and may guide the development of interventions to promote CPAP adherence. Over the past 10 years, intervention studies to promote CPAP adherence have incorporated a multitude of strategies including education, support, cognitive behavioural approaches, and mixed strategies. This review of the current status of research on CPAP adherence will (i) synthesize the extant literature with regard to measuring, defining, and predicting CPAP adherence; (ii) review published intervention studies aimed at promoting CPAP adherence; and (iii) suggest directions for future empiric study of adherence to CPAP that will have implications for translational science. Our current understanding of CPAP adherence suggests that adherence is a multi-factorial, complex clinical problem that requires similarly designed approaches to effectively address poor CPAP adherence in the OSA population."

Nine patients (8 men and 1 woman) with asthma and OSA confirmed on all-night sleep study were studied. All patients suffered from frequent nocturnal asthma attacks, resulting in hospitalizations and respiratory arrests in 3. All patients had symptoms of heavy snoring, nocturnal choking, frequent sleep arousals, and excessive daytime sleepiness. They recorded their daily peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) in the mornings and evenings, before and after bronchodilator in three 2-wk periods consisting of control, nCPAP, and control. During the period of nCPAP therapy, all patients recorded improvement in their PEFR. The mean prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator PEFR for the 9 patients were significantly higher during nCPAP therapy than during both control periods. This study confirms that nCPAP therapy can be used safely in treating patients with OSA and coexisting asthma. Furthermore, nCPAP treatment improves the asthma control and, in particular, the nocturnal attacks in this group of patients. These results also suggest that recurrent upper airway obstruction and snoring may be important triggering mechanisms of nocturnal asthma attacks."

This case illustrates the need for clinicians to balance seizure control and SDB in patients with VNS."

            "abstract": "We assessed the regulation of nasal patency supine in subjects with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) compared to healthy controls. Healthy subjects increase nasal obstruction when changing body position from sitting to supine, possibly due to increased hydrostatic pressure in the head supine. Limited data indicate that this response is altered in patients with OSAS, suggesting that supine nasal patency is actively regulated. This study examined the nasal response to recumbent body position using acoustic rhinometry in OSAS patients and healthy controls. Twenty subjects (16 men and 4 women, mean age 55 +/- 16 years), with diagnosed OSAS [mean apnoea hypopnoea index (AHI) 46 +/- 22 events/h] without nasal obstruction and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-naive, underwent measurement of intra-nasal cross sectional area by acoustic rhinometry at sitting and after 5 min supine. Twenty healthy controls (13 men, 7 women, mean age 35 +/- 9 years) were also included in the study. In the patients with OSAS, the mean minimal cross sectional area (MCA, left + right nasal cavity) was unchanged between sitting (1.18 +/- 0.41 cm(2)) and supine (1.21 +/- 0.35 cm(2), P = 0.5). In the healthy controls, the mean MCA decreased from 1.06 +/- 0.18 to 0.94 +/- 0.21 cm(2) supine, P = 0.01. This study showed that the normal decrease in nasal patency following a change in body position from sitting to supine is absent in patients with OSAS. The results indicate that there is an active regulation of supine nasal patency."

Serum IMA concentrations correlated significantly with the apnoea-hypopnoea index, mean SaO2, desaturation index, and C-reactive protein concentrations. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that OSAS increased the serum IMA concentration independent of age, sex, body mass index, smoking habit, and cardiovascular disease. After 3 months of treatment with CPAP, OSAS patients had significantly lower serum IMA concentrations (0.555 ± 0.062 ABSU to 0.431 ± 0.063 ABSU, P < 0.001). The results showed that OSAS is associated with elevated concentrations of IMA, which can be reversed by effective CPAP treatment."

            "abstract": "These practice parameters are an update of the previously published recommendations regarding the use of autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP) devices for titrating pressures and treating adult patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at an effective setting verified by attended polysomnography is a standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). APAP devices change the treatment pressure based on feedback from various patient measures such as airflow, pressure fluctuations, or measures of airway resistance. These devices may aid in the pressure titration process, address possible changes in pressure requirements throughout a given night and from night to night, aid in treatment of OSA when attended CPAP titration has not or cannot be accomplished, or improve patient comfort. A task force of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine has reviewed the literature published since the 2002 practice parameter on the use of APAP. Current recommendations follow: (1) APAP devices are not recommended to diagnose OSA; (2) patients with congestive heart failure, patients with significant lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; patients expected to have nocturnal arterial oxyhemoglobin desaturation due to conditions other than OSA (e.g., obesity hypoventilation syndrome); patients who do not snore (either naturally or as a result of palate surgery); and patients who have central sleep apnea syndromes are not currently candidates for APAP titration or treatment; (3) APAP devices are not currently recommended for split-night titration; (4) certain APAP devices may be used during attended titration with polysomnography to identify a single pressure for use with standard CPAP for treatment of moderate to severe OSA; (5) certain APAP devices may be initiated and used in the self-adjusting mode for unattended treatment of patients with moderate to severe OSA without significant comorbidities (CHF, COPD, central sleep apnea syndromes, or hypoventilation syndromes); (6) certain APAP devices may be used in an unattended way to determine a fixed CPAP treatment pressure for patients with moderate to severe OSA without significant comorbidities (CHF, COPD, central sleep apnea syndromes, or hypoventilation syndromes); (7) patients being treated with fixed CPAP on the basis of APAP titration or being treated with APAP must have close clinical follow-up to determine treatment effectiveness and safety; and (8) a reevaluation and, if necessary, a standard attended CPAP titration should be performed if symptoms do not resolve or the APAP treatment otherwise appears to lack efficacy."

We aimed to evaluate it in a randomized controlled clinical trial, with blinded assessment of outcomes. Four hundred thirty-four resistant hypertensive patients were screened and 117 patients with moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnea, defined by an apnea-hypopnea index ≥15 per hour, were randomized to 6-month CPAP treatment (57 patients) or no therapy (60 patients), while maintaining antihypertensive treatment. Clinic and 24-hour ambulatory BPs were obtained before and after 6-month treatment. Primary outcomes were changes in clinic and ambulatory BPs and in nocturnal BP fall patterns. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol (limited to those with uncontrolled ambulatory BPs) analyses were performed. Patients had mean (SD) 24-hour BP of 129(16)/75(12) mm Hg, and 59% had uncontrolled ambulatory BPs. Mean apnea-hypopnea index was 41 per hour and 58.5% had severe obstructive sleep apnea. On intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in any BP change, neither in nocturnal BP fall, between CPAP and control groups. The best effect of CPAP was on night-time systolic blood pressure in per-protocol analysis, with greater reduction of 4.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -11.3 to +3.1 mm Hg; P=0.24) and an increase in nocturnal BP fall of 2.2% (95% confidence interval, -1.6% to +5.8%; P=0.25), in comparison with control group. In conclusion, CPAP treatment had no significant effect on clinic and ambulatory BPs in patients with resistant hypertension and moderate/severe obstructive sleep apnea, although a beneficial effect on night-time systolic blood pressure and on nocturnal BP fall might exist in patients with uncontrolled ambulatory BP levels."

            "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may have greater pharyngeal critical pressure (Pcrit), which reflects the increase in upper airway collapsibility. The contribution of Pcrit to the severity of OSA and to the efficacious continuous positive pressure (nCPAPeff) therapy has never been extensively described and no data are available about the interaction of Pcrit, age, and anthropometric variables. To determine the relationship between Pcrit, severity of the disease, nCPAPeff, and anthropometric variables we measured Pcrit in a group of 106 patients with OSA. Pharyngeal critical pressure was derived from the relationship between maximal inspiratory flow and nasal pressure, Pcrit representing the extrapolated pressure at zero flow. Upper airway resistance (Rus) was determined as the reciprocal of the slope (DeltaPn/DeltaVImax cm H2O/L/s) in the regression equation. In a subgroup of 68 patients, during the diagnostic night, we measured as indices of respiratory effort, the maximal inspiratory esophageal pressure (Pes) at the end of apnea (Pesmax), the overall increase from the minimum to the maximum (DeltaPes), and the rate of increase of Pes during apnea (RPes). As a group, the mean Pcrit was 2.09 +/- 0.1 cm H2O (range, 0 to 4.5) and the mean Rus was 11.1 +/- 0.5 cm H2O/L/s. Although men have greater Pcrit, pharyngeal collapsibility was influenced neither by neck size nor by body mass index (BMI). Although there was a significant relationship between Pcrit and apnea plus hypopnea index (AHI) (r = 0.23, p = 0.02), neck circumference was the stronger predictor of apnea frequency, with Pcrit contributing only to the 3% of the variance. In the group of patients as a whole, a model including AHI, BMI, Rus, and Pcrit explained the 36% of the variance in nCPAPeff, with a greater contribution of AHI, Pcrit accounting for only 3% of the variation. In patients for whom the measure of respiratory effort was obtained, 42% of the variance in nCPAPeff was explained by RPes (33%) and BMI. From these results we conclude that Pcrit alone does not yield a diagnostically accurate estimation of OSA severity and nCPAPeff. Although individual collapsibility may predispose to pharyngeal collapse, upper airway occlusion may require the combination of several factors, including obesity, upper airway structure, and abnormalities in muscle control."

            "abstract": "The authors have investigated whether treatment of sleep apnoea with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) improves depressive symptoms, personal activities of daily living (ADL), cognitive functioning and delirium in patients that have suffered a stroke. Sixty-three patients consecutively admitted to a stroke rehabilitation unit 2-4 weeks after a stroke, with an apnoea/hypopnoea index > or =15, were randomized to either nCPAP treatment (n=33) or a control group (n=30). Four patients dropped out after randomization. Both groups were assessed at baseline and after 7 and 28 nights using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Barthel-ADL index, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Compared to the control group, depressive symptoms (MADRS total score) improved in patients randomized to nCPAP treatment (p=0.004). No significant treatment effect was found with regard to delirium, MMSE or Barthel-ADL index. Delirium and low cognitive level (MMSE score) explained poor compliance with nCPAP. Depressive symptoms are reduced through nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with severe stroke and sleep apnoea. Compliance with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment is a problem in stroke patients, especially when delirium and severe cognitive impairment occur."

Nasal continuous positive airway pressure is the primary treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea, but many patients are unable or unwilling to comply with this treatment. Oral appliances are an alternative treatment for sleep apnoea.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The objective was to review the effects of oral appliance in the treatment of sleep apnoea in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched MEDLINE 1966-2003, and the Cochrane Airways Group Sleep Apnoea RCT Register.

All the studies had some methodological shortcomings. Oral appliances improved apnoea-hypopnoea index compared with inactive control (-13.17 AHI [-18.53 to -7.80] parallel group data - four studies). Oral appliances reduced daytime sleepiness in two trials (WMD -1.77 [95%CI: -2.91 to -0.62]). Oral appliances were less effective than continuous positive pressure in reducing apnoea-hypopnoea index (WMD 13 [95% CI: 7.63, 18.36], parallel studies - two trials; WMD 6.75 [4.93, 8.57] cross-over studies - six trials). However, no significant difference was observed on symptom scores (3 trials). Nasal continuous positive pressure was more effective at improving minimum arterial oxygen saturation during sleep compared with oral appliance. In two small crossover studies, participants preferred oral appliance therapy to continuous positive airways pressure.\n    \n\n\n          Reviewer's conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There is some limited evidence suggesting that oral appliance improves subjective sleepiness and sleep disordered breathing compared with a control. Nasal continuous positive airways pressure appears to be more effective in improving sleep disordered breathing than oral appliance. Until there is more definitive evidence on the effectiveness of oral appliances, it would appear to be appropriate to restrict oral appliance therapy to patients with sleep apnoea who are unwilling or unable to comply with continuous positive airways pressure therapy."

            "abstract": "Background and purpose:\n        \n      \n      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular disease. Preliminary studies suggested breathing improvement in patients with apnea and heart disease when atrial overdrive pacing was applied during sleep. However, more recent studies do not show significant beneficial effect for atrial overdrive pacing in OSA. To further investigate this relationship, we conducted a randomized clinical trial evaluating the effect of atrial overdrive pacing on sleep-related breathing events in subjects with OSA and systolic heart failure.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We screened 33 subjects with symptoms consistent with OSA. On a screening overnight polysomnography (PSG), 15 subjects with mean age of 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 6.6) and ejection fraction of 38% (SD 14.4%) had OSA defined as having an apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of > or =15 per hour of sleep. These subjects underwent additional PSGs including a night with atrial overdrive pacing (O), a night with pacemaker rate set at 40-50 beats per minutes (N), and a positive airway pressure titration night. The O and N nights were consecutive and the order was randomized. For O, the pacemaker rate was set at 15 beats higher than the average nightly heart rate (determined from the screening night).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      At baseline, mean AHI was 34.8 (15.5) and mean SaO(2) nadir was 85% (3.2%). Average heart rate was significantly higher on O nights compared to N nights (p<0.005). The apnea index (AI) was statistically lower on O nights compared to N nights (18+/-16.6 vs. 24+/-18.9, p<0.05). However, AHI and minimum and average O(2) saturations did not differ significantly between O and N nights. Interestingly, AHI improved statistically significantly on O nights in younger subjects.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      While statistically reliable, the small pacing-related reduction in sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) events is of unknown clinical significance. By contrast, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) dramatically improved AHI, AI, respiratory arousal index, and O(2) saturation. Thus our data suggest that overdrive pacing exerts a mild effect on respiratory events in some heart failure patients with OSA; however, atrial overdrive pacing was not therapeutically effective for improving airway patency and sleep-related respiratory function."

Univariate and multivariate analyses of the data on patients registered in the Association Nationale pour le Traitement A Domicile de l'Insuffisance Respiratoire chronique (ANTADIR) Observatory between January 1, 1985 and December 31, 1993 and followed to January 1, 1996. Survival ratios were compared to those of the French population. A case control study compared patients who died with patients of the same age and sex, in the same Regional Association, who were equipped with CPAP at the same time. Five-thousand-six-hundred-and-sixty-nine patients had CPAP treatment. Two-hundred-and-seventy-six had died. One-hundred-and-twenty-four deaths were examined and compared to 123 control subjects. Overall mortality was the same as the general French population. Independent risk factors for death were age, oxygen tension in arterial blood (Pa,O2) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) (per cent predicted). In the case-control study independent risk factors for death in the past history were cardiac arrhythmia with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-7.2), respiratory disorders (OR 2.8; CI 1.6-4.9) ischaemic events (OR 2.2; CI 1.2-4.2), neurological and psychiatric disorders (OR 2.4; CI 1.1-5.4). A significant excess of cardiovascular deaths and an excess of deaths from accidents and poisonings was found. In conclusion, patients die on therapy predominantly from cardiovascular causes but many have a past history of cardiovascular conditions. Compliance with treatment may be important for survival. Continuous positive airway pressure is an effective therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome but older patients with reduced spirometry and hypoxaemia may need more attention paid to these aspects of their condition."

It is currently regarded as the first line therapy for OSAS. The principal indication for n-CPAP treatment is daytime sleepiness. Nasal-CPAP improves daytime sleepiness dramatically in severe cases and the effect is objectively measurable with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). It is noteworthy that n-CPAP also improves symptoms, subjective daytime sleepiness, cognitive function, IQ, mood, quality of life and driving ability already in patients with mild sleep apnea with an apnea/hypopneaindex (AHI) between 5 and 15 per hour of sleep during overnight polysomnography. Although not yet 100% robust, there is clear evidence that patients with OSAS have an increased frequency of systemic hypertension. Some early and imperfect studies suggest that CPAP reduces cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes; however unequivocal evidence that n-CPAP reduces mortality is still awaited. There is now good evidence that treatment with n-CPAP reduces the two- to sevenfold increased risk of road accidents of untreated patients with OSAS. In summary, there exists abundant evidence today that n-CPAP is an efficient therapy for symptomatic patients with the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. A trial with n-CPAP is therefore justified in all symptomatic patients. Based on the large number of randomized controlled trials of n-CPAP a therapeutic trial is indicated even in only mildly symptomatic patients with OSAS. Nasal-CPAP use and outcomes of therapy can be improved by provision of an intensive CPAP-education and support program."

            "title": "Pharmacotherapies for obstructive sleep apnoea: where are we now?",
            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is common, causes considerable morbidity and probably contributes to mortality particularly through associated cardiovascular disease. The physical therapy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is extremely effective in the majority of patients but most patients would prefer an alternative. Intuitively, OSA should be amenable to pharmacotherapy. The upper airway of affected individuals can be narrowed but is patent during wakefulness. Collapse of the airway during sleep occurs when negative intra-luminal pressure generated by inspiratory effort exceeds the tone of the upper airway dilators. This mismatch may be in part due to respiratory drive instability but the state-dependent fall in drive to the airway dilator muscles is the biggest factor in most patients. Various drugs have been investigated as treatment for OSA. Acetazolamide, theophylline, nicotine, opioid antagonists and medroxyprogesterone have been used to increase respiratory drive. Clonidine has been tested with the aim of reducing rapid eye movement sleep when OSA is often most severe. Various antidepressants have been used to suppress rapid eye movement sleep and to preferentially activate the upper airway dilators. The drug trials have often been of poor design and none has included more than a few patients. Most of the drugs have been found to be ineffective and those that have worked for some patients (acetazolamide and protriptyline) have produced intolerable adverse effects. There have been recent advances in the understanding of the neurotransmitters involved in the control of sleep and the upper airway motor neurones, offering the possibility of novel approaches to the drug treatment of OSA for those patients who cannot tolerate or do not benefit from CPAP. It seems likely that a better understanding of the mechanisms of OSA in individual patients and tailoring of drug therapy will be the way forward."

Firstly, we performed a case control study in 32 OSAHS patients and 27 non-OSAHS participants. Fractional eNO (FeNO) and eNO from the central airway (J'awNO) and from alveoli (CANO) were compared in OSAHS and control groups. Also, correlation of eNO to severity of OSAHS was analyzed. Secondly, a prospective study was conducted in 30 severe OSAHS patients who received a short-term nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) treatment. We evaluated eNO, plasma ET-1 concentration, and echocardiography during the treatment process and explored the potential relationship among them.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      FeNO and J'awNO were higher in OSAHS and associated with disease severity, while CANO was relatively lower. After nCPAP treatment in severe OSAHS patients, FeNO and J'awNO decreased and CANO increased significantly. Substantial agreement was shown between the elevation of CANO and the decrease of plasma ET-1 concentration after nCPAP by Kappa analysis for consistency. Tei index, which is considered indicative of global right ventricular function, might be predicted by plasma ET-1 levels in severe OSAHS patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      NO exchange model provides us with more information of eNO derived from different areas. eNO is not only confirmed to be an effective method for airway inflammation evaluation in the follow-up of OSAHS, CANO may also serve as a useful marker in monitoring endothelial function, resistance of pulmonary circulation, and right ventricular function for clinical implication."

BP was monitored at half-hourly intervals for a 24-hour period both on CPAP and on an oral placebo, each given for a minimum of 3 weeks. Objective effective CPAP use averaged 4.3 hours per night. Weight and anti-hypertensive medications remained stable over the study period. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial BP for 24-hour, daytime and nighttime periods were not significantly different on placebo compared to CPAP. Those patients with no significant overnight fall in BP on placebo (\"non-dippers\") showed a significant improvement in daytime mean arterial BP on CPAP (98 +/- 4 mm Hg) compared to placebo (102 +/- 4 mm Hg; p = 0.01). These findings, in a well-controlled trial, suggest that BP is not reduced by CPAP in a heterogeneous group of SAHS patients, but it may be selectively improved in those patients most at risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."

Earlier publications focused on the effectiveness of this new method but did not indicate the potential hazard and the selection criteria of patients. We accomplished a prospective study to evaluate a machine-controlled CPAP titration method in an unselected group of 21 patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) requiring CPAP therapy. Unattended CPAP titrations were completed in the sleep laboratory, followed by conventional CPAP titration night. The CPAP levels assessed through automatic titrations showed strong agreement with those from the control nights. Fifteen patients had no pathologic cardiorespiratory events during machine-controlled titration. Undesirable cardiorespiratory complications developed in six patients with underlying cardiorespiratory disorder. Two patients had to stop the procedure. Two patients needed a reset of the actual pressure to baseline because of central apneas and one patient because of high-grade arrhythmia. The machine-controlled CPAP titration enabled reliable assessment of an effective pressure and appeared to be safe in selected patients with OSA. However, because the method caused significant adverse effects in some patients, we recommend that unattended CPAP titration not be attempted in patients with underlying cardiorespiratory disease."

It also examines evidence regarding use of BPAP in OSA with associated hypoventilation, such as in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or severe obesity.

We prospectively investigated the efficacy of a self-titrating nasal CPAP system in the acute treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. Twenty patients with moderately severe OSA [apnea hypopnea index (AHI) > 15/hour] were enrolled in a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial. An initial diagnostic sleep study was performed, followed by randomization to a manually adjusted CPAP titration on one night and self titrating CPAP on the other night. On the conventional CPAP night, the CPAP was manually adjusted until abolition of all apneas and electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals, whereas the self-titrating CPAP was set in automatic mode at lights out. The self-titrating CPAP system utilized an algorithm based on airway vibration patterns to detect airway stability. The AHI decreased from 50.8 +/- 28.8/hour [mean +/- standard deviation (SD)] at baseline to 3.8 +/- 3.1/hour (p < 0.005) during manually adjusted and 6.1 +/- 5.3/hour (p < 0.005) during self-titrating CPAP.

No significant differences in any measure of oxygenation or sleep architecture were observed between the manually adjusted and self-titrating CPAP nights except that the lowest arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) was higher with manual titration (84.4 +/- 4.2% vs. 79.9 +/- 9.7%, p < 0.05).

Failure to increase pressure and failure to maintain minimum pressure occurred in 7 of the 20 subjects during the self-titrating study. This required manual resetting of the system in five subjects, but the system self-corrected in two subjects. An unsupervised study would have resulted in undertreatment of OSA. Based on a single-night laboratory study, self-titrating CPAP was well tolerated and improved OSA and sleep architecture comparable to manually adjusted CPAP.

In conclusion, OSA is associated with sleepiness, inflammation and insulin resistance, even in nonobese males, and this association is stronger in males than in females. Short-term CPAP does not improve the inflammatory/metabolic aberrations in OSA."

After an adaptation period of 156 +/- 14 d (mean +/- SE), patients used the OSA-Monobloc, the OSA-Herbst, and no appliance in random order, using each appliance for 1 wk. Symptom scores were recorded and sleep studies were done at the end of each week. Several symptom scores were significantly improved with both appliances, but to a greater degree with the OSA-Monobloc. Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores were 8.8 +/- 0.7 with the OSA-Herbst, and 8.6 +/- 0.8 with the OSA-Monobloc devices, and 13.1 +/- 0.9 without therapy (p < 0.05 versus both appliances).

Side effects were mild and of equal prevalence with both appliances. Fifteen patients preferred the OSA-Monobloc, eight patients had no preference, and one patient preferred the OSA-Herbst device (p < 0.008 versus OSA-Monobloc). We conclude that both the OSA-Herbst and the OSA-Monobloc are effective therapeutic devices for sleep apnea.

The aim of this study was to characterize patients who were unable to tolerate CPAP treatment (non-complaint) as opposed to those who continued using CPAP (complaint). A case-control study was performed in which the cases comprised of 40 patients who had been started on CPAP treatment but had found the treatment unacceptable and had ceased to use CPAP. The controls comprised of 63 patients with OSAS who had been prescribed CPAP and were still using it (follow-up period 18 months to 10 yr). The patients who stopped CPAP treatment had a higher mean age, had more frequently undergone uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) and had a lower mean oxygen desaturation index (ODI) than patients who continued using CPAP. ODI was an independent negative predictor of non-compliance (OR5units=0.6(0.4-0.8), P<0.01). The two most common reasons for non-compliance were problems in the nose or pharynx and lack of subjective effect by the treatment. High age was an independent risk factor for non-compliance because of problems in the nose or pharynx (OR10years=2.8(1.3-6.1), P<0.01), while having undergone UPPP was a risk factor for non-compliance because of lack of effect (OR=4.5 (1.1-19.1), P<0.05). In conclusion, patients with less severe OSAS are more likely to discontinue CPAP treatment. The risk of experiencing nasal and pharyngeal side-effects of such severity that the patient stops using CPAP increases with age and patients who have undergone UPPP are less likely to experience a clinical improvement after being started on CPAP therapy."

It has recently been reported that OSAHS has a significant effect on the secretion of leptin, a hormone involved in the control of body weight and sympathetic nerve activity. In addition to the circadian rhythm of leptin secretion, the effects of one night of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) and the mechanism of the effects of nCPAP on nocturnal leptin secretion in patients with OSAHS has not yet been elucidated.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Blood samples were obtained at 21.00 hours, 00.00 hours, 03.00 hours, and 06.30 hours from 21 subjects with OSAHS (mean apnoea and hypopnoea index 52.4/h), with and without nCPAP treatment. Iodine-123 (I(123))-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging was used to evaluate myocardial sympathetic function before nCPAP treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Plasma leptin reached a peak level at 00:00 hours (p<0.01) in patients with OSAHS, both with and without nCPAP treatment. The first night of nCPAP treatment significantly decreased the plasma leptin levels at 03.00 hours (without nCPAP: mean (SE) 21.6 (4.7) ng/ml; with nCPAP: 19.3 (4.1) ng/ml, p<0.02) and at 06.30 hours (without nCPAP: 17.6 (3.8) ng/ml; with nCPAP: 15.2 (3.2) ng/ml, p<0.01). The magnitude of the decrease in leptin levels after nCPAP treatment was significantly correlated with cardiac sympathetic function measured before nCPAP treatment (p<0.03).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients with OSAHS undergo nocturnal increases in leptin levels in spite of interruption of sleep due to apnoea and hypopnoea, a trend seen in normal subjects. Plasma leptin levels in patients with OSAHS decreased significantly after the first night of nCPAP treatment. Enhanced cardiac sympathetic function in these patients may contribute to the leptin levels before nCPAP treatment and vice versa."

            "abstract": "Side-effects directly due to the nasal mask are common in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) commencing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Recently, nasal pillows have been designed to overcome these issues. Limited evidence exists of the benefits and effectiveness of these devices. Twenty-one patients (19 male, 49±10years) with the established diagnosis of OSAS [apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI): 52±22] and who had a successful CPAP titration were commenced on CPAP therapy (10±2cmH2O), and randomized to 4weeks of a nasal pillow (P) and a standard nasal mask (M) in a crossover design. Outcome measures were objective compliance, AHI, quality of life, Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and CPAP side-effects. There was no difference in compliance (M versus P: 5.1±1.9h versus 5.0±1.7h; P=0.701) and AHI (2.6±2.7 versus 3.0±2.9; P=0.509). Quality of life and ESS improved with CPAP, but there was no difference in the extent of improvement between both devices. Usage of nasal pillows resulted in less reported pressure on the face and more subjects found the nasal pillow the more comfortable device. However, there was no clear overall preference for either device at the end of the study (mask=57%, pillow=43%; P=0.513). The applied CPAP pressure did not correlate with compliance, AHI and ESS. Furthermore, no differences in outcome parameters were noted comparing groups with CPAP pressure <10 and ≥10cm H(2) O. Nasal pillows are equally effective in CPAP therapy, but do not generally lead to improved compliance."

            "abstract": "We evaluated the efficacy of two different continuous positive airway pressure devices with automatic mask pressure adjustment (autoCPAP) in comparison with fixed CPAP in treating obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in 29 patients. The mean (+/- SE) apnea-hypopnea index was 46 +/- 4 per hour and the Epworth score was 14.2 +/- 0.7. Patients were treated over three consecutive 1-month periods with three regimens in random order: an autoCPAP device responding to apnea-hypopnea and snoring, another autoCPAP device responding to snoring and changes in flow contour, and fixed CPAP at the 90th pressure percentile titrated by autoCPAP over 2 weeks. Allowed pressure in the autoCPAP mode was 4 to 15 cm H2O. At the end of each treatment period, symptoms, quality of life, vigilance, and nocturnal breathing disturbances were evaluated. All three treatment modalities improved symptoms, quality-of-life domains, and apnea-hypopnea index significantly and to a similar degree. Mean (+/- SE) maintenance-of-wakefulness time increased by 4.5 +/- 1.8, 6.0 +/- 1.5, and 6.1 +/- 1.4 minutes with DeVilbiss AutoAdjust LT, AutoSet T, and fixed-pressure CPAP, respectively (p<0.001 vs. baseline, p=not significant for comparisons among the three modalities). We conclude that both autoCPAP devices were equally effective as fixed-pressure CPAP in improving major outcomes during short-term therapy of sleep apnea."

            "abstract": "Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most widely used therapy for obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Despite its general efficacy, oxygen desaturation due to hypoventilation persists in some patients. The present study analysed the factors which are associated with this primary failure and, moreover, examined the effect of a bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) trial. In a 15-month period, 13 patients with OSA (Group A) failed to respond to initial CPAP therapy defined by a remaining apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI) of > or = 5 or a mean nocturnal SaO2 < 90%. These patients were compared to an age- and AHI-matched control group (Group B) successfully treated by CPAP. A logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors which are associated with initial failure to CPAP. Patients of the CPAP-failure group were treated with nasal BiPAP in the control mode. These patients were significantly more obese than patients of the control group (mean body mass index 44.2 +/- 7.7 vs 31.2 +/- 6.3 kg m-2; P < 0.001). PaO2 at rest (P < 0.001) and at exercise (P < 0.005) was significantly lower in Group A patients. PaCO2 at rest (P < 0.001) was significantly higher in Group A patients and changed for the worse during exercise, whereas it improved in the control group. Group A patients spent significantly (P < 0.0001) more time with oxygen saturation < 90%. The percentage of time spent at < 90% of SaO2 was the only factor which was independently associated with the initial failure of CPAP (OR 1.13; 95% CI 1.0-1.2). After 3 months of treatment with BiPAP, the patients' blood gas values while awake improved significantly (P < 0.05) for PaO2 as well as for PaCO2. In conclusion, patients with OSA resistant to initial CPAP are morbidly obese with impaired awake blood gas values. The percentage of time spent at < 90% of nocturnal SaO2 is independently associated with initial failure of CPAP. BiPAP in the control mode is adequate for nocturnal ventilation, and improves awake blood gas values."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by repeated episodes of obstructed (apnea) or reduced (hypopnea) airflow in the upper airway during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnea results in variable arterial oxygen desaturations and arousals leading to sleep fragmentation. Most patients with OSA first come to the attention of a clinician when they complain of daytime sleepiness or when their bed partner reports loud snoring and witnessed episodes. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with impaired quality of life, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and motor vehicle accidents, yet the disorder remains undiagnosed in a significant portion of the population. Overnight polysomnography, whether facility-based or portable, is required for appropriate patient diagnosis. Portable monitoring can be used in patients with a high pre-test probability for moderate-to-severe OSA, who are without significant comorbidities. Management of OSA requires a long-term multidisciplinary approach. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the mainstay of treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe OSA. Oral appliances may be indicated in patients with mild-to-moderate OSA who do not wish to use CPAP. Surgical therapy is generally reserved for selected patients in whom CPAP or oral appliance are not an option."

Studies of patients with OSA, defined as an apnea-hypopnea index >10 events/h, and PH, defined as PA pressure >25 mmHg were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. A total of 222 patients from seven studies (341.53 person-years) had reported PA pressures before and after treatment with CPAP therapy. 77 % of participants were men, with a mean age of 52.5 years, a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 58 events/h, and mean PA pressure of 39.3 ± 6.3 mmHg.

Of 1,516 participants enrolled, 1,105 were randomized, and 1,098 participants diagnosed with OSA contributed to the analysis of the primary outcome measures.\n## INTERVENTION\nActive or sham CPAP MEASUREMENTS: THREE NEUROCOGNITIVE VARIABLES, EACH REPRESENTING A NEUROCOGNITIVE DOMAIN: Pathfinder Number Test-Total Time (attention and psychomotor function [A/P]), Buschke Selective Reminding Test-Sum Recall (learning and memory [L/M]), and Sustained Working Memory Test-Overall Mid-Day Score (executive and frontal-lobe function [E/F])\n## RESULTS\nThe primary neurocognitive analyses showed a difference between groups for only the E/F variable at the 2 month CPAP visit, but no difference at the 6 month CPAP visit or for the A/P or L/M variables at either the 2 or 6 month visits. When stratified by measures of OSA severity (AHI or oxygen saturation parameters), the primary E/F variable and one secondary E/F neurocognitive variable revealed transient differences between study arms for those with the most severe OSA. Participants in the active CPAP group had a significantly greater ability to remain awake whether measured subjectively by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale or objectively by the maintenance of wakefulness test.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCPAP treatment improved both subjectively and objectively measured sleepiness, especially in individuals with severe OSA (AHI > 30). CPAP use resulted in mild, transient improvement in the most sensitive measures of executive and frontal-lobe function for those with severe disease, which suggests the existence of a complex OSA-neurocognitive relationship.\n## CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION\nRegistered at clinicaltrials.gov.

            "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that desipramine reduces the sleep-related loss of upper airway dilator muscle activity and reduces pharyngeal collapsibility in healthy humans without obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). The aim of the present physiological study was to determine the effects of desipramine on upper airway collapsibility and apnoea-hypopnea index (AHI) in OSA patients.A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised crossover trial in 14 OSA patients was performed. Participants received treatment or placebo in randomised order before sleep. Pharyngeal collapsibility (critical collapsing pressure of the upper airway (Pcrit)) and ventilation under both passive (V'0,passive) and active (V'0,active) upper airway muscle conditions were evaluated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) manipulation. AHI was quantified off CPAP.Desipramine reduced active Pcrit (median (interquartile range) -5.2 (4.3) cmH2O on desipramine versus -1.9 (2.7) cmH2O on placebo; p=0.049) but not passive Pcrit (-2.2 (3.4) versus -0.7 (2.1) cmH2O; p=0.135). A greater reduction in AHI occurred in those with minimal muscle compensation (defined as V'0,active-V'0,passive) on placebo (r=0.71, p=0.009). The reduction in AHI was driven by the improvement in muscle compensation (r=0.72, p=0.009).In OSA patients, noradrenergic stimulation with desipramine improves pharyngeal collapsibility and may be an effective treatment in patients with minimal upper airway muscle compensation."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Obstructive sleep apnoea is the periodic reduction (hypopnoea) or cessation (apnoea) of breathing due to narrowing or occlusion of the upper airway during sleep. The main symptom is daytime sleepiness and it has been suggested it is linked to premature death, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, stroke and road traffic accidents.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The main treatment for sleep apnoea is with the use of continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP), which requires a flow generator and mask. These are used at night to prevent apnoea, hypoxia and sleep disturbance. The objective was to assess the effects of CPAP in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnoea in adults.\n    \n\n\n          Search strategy:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Trials Register and reference lists of articles. We consulted experts in the field. Searches were current to July 2005.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised trials comparing nocturnal CPAP with an inactive control or oral appliances in adults with obstructive sleep apnoea (an apnoea and hypopnoea index greater than five per hour). Trials had a minimum intervention period of two weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Trial quality was assessed and two review authors extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for missing information. Parallel and crossover group trials were analysed separately.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six trials involving 1718 people met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was mixed. Compared with control, CPAP showed significant improvements in certain objective and subjective sleepiness, measures of quality of life and cognitive function (parallel-group studies: Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) -3.83 units, 95% CI -4.57 to -3.09; crossover studies: ESS -1.84 units, 95% CI -2.57 to -1.11). Twenty-four hour systolic and diastolic blood pressures were lower with CPAP compared with control (parallel-group trials). Compared with oral appliances, CPAP significantly reduced the apnoea and hypopnoea index (crossover studies: -7.97 events/hr, 95% CI -9.56 to -6.38) and improved sleep efficiency (crossover studies: 2.31%, 95% CI 0.02 to 4.6) and minimum oxygen saturation (4.14%, 95% CI 3.25 to 5.03). Responders to both treatments expressed a strong preference for the oral appliance. However, participants were more likely to withdraw on OA than on CPAP therapy.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      CPAP is effective in reducing symptoms of sleepiness and improving quality of life measures in people with moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). It is more effective than oral appliances in reducing respiratory disturbances in these people but subjective outcomes are more equivocal. Certain people tend to prefer oral appliances to CPAP where both are effective. This could be because they offer a more convenient way of controlling OSA. Short-term data indicate that CPAP leads to lower blood pressure than control. Long-term data are required for all outcomes in order to determine whether the initial benefits seen in short-term clinical trials persist."

            "abstract": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses a group of disorders that include obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), central sleep apnoea (CSA) and nocturnal hypoventilation. SDB commonly coexists with sleep disorders such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome, and sleep deprivation has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of SDB. Participants of a workshop, held at the 6th annual meeting of The International Sleep Disorders Forum: The Art of Good Sleep in 2008, evaluated whether the effective management of sleep disorders could result in a reduction in SDB. Following the workshop, a critical review of the literature in the field of sleep and SDB was conducted in order to assess the impact of improving sleep on SDB, and to determine whether measures taken to improve sleep result in a subsequent improvement in SDB. Results showed that studies evaluating the influence of improved sleep on respiratory abnormalities in patients with SDB are lacking. Studies in patients with OSA, with or without obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, show that therapy with continuous positive airways pressure and non-invasive ventilation improves sleep parameters with beneficial effects on SDB. Studies involving small numbers of patients have shown that the antidepressants fluoxetine and mirtazapine produce improvements in sleep parameters and the apnoea-hypopnoea index, and that acetazolamide may improve CSA. The benzodiazepines flurazepam, temazepam and nitrazepam, the hypnotic zolpidem, the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon and gamma-hydroxybutyrate have all been shown to improve sleep, but are not associated with reductions or worsening in SDB. It is clear that there is a distinct knowledge gap with regard to the benefit of improving sleep disturbances for subsequent improvements in SDB. Randomized controlled clinical trials investigating the effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological improvement of sleep disorders focusing on whether there is improvement in coexisting OSA/SDB are clearly needed. Furthermore, well-designed clinical trials investigating the role of hypnotic agents in improving SDB in certain phenotypes will enable the development of treatment recommendations for primary care physicians managing these patients in routine clinical practice."

            "abstract": "This review aimed to determine the effectiveness of positional modification techniques in preventing supine sleep, sleep-disordered breathing and other clinically important outcomes in patients with supine obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Randomized controlled trials comparing positional modification techniques with any other therapy or placebo were included. Electronic searches of databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science up to April 2016 were performed. Meta-analysis was undertaken where possible. This comprehensive meta-analysis found benefit for positional modification techniques in those with supine OSA in terms of reduction in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and time spent supine. Whilst positional modification techniques were effective in terms of a reduction in AHI, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was more effective than these techniques. A reliable diagnosis of supine OSA should be considered, and further research is required on patient-centred outcomes including comfort, barriers to adherence, cost-analysis, and long term outcomes including the effect on cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent sleep-related breathing disorder associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome. Endothelial dysfunction is one of the proposed mechanistic links between OSA and the increased cardiovascular risk. Treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may reverse this detrimental pathophysiological consequence of OSA. Most studies on the effect of CPAP on endothelial function in OSA are limited by their low sample size. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effect CPAP therapy on endothelial function in patients with OSA. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis searching literature databases up to August 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of CPAP on endothelial function in OSA, assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and other validated techniques. The primary outcome for the meta-analysis (DerSimonian/Laird random-effects method) was the treatment effect on FMD. Eight RCTs comparing the effects of therapeutic CPAP versus subtherapeutic CPAP (or no intervention) on endothelial function involving 245 OSA patients were included in the systematic review. The studies are consistent in effect direction, showing an improvement of endothelial function by CPAP. Four RCTs involving 150 patients could be used for the meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, CPAP therapy (range 2-24 weeks) significantly increased absolute % FMD by 3.87% (95% confidence interval: 1.93-5.80, P < 0.001). In patients with OSA, CPAP therapy improves endothelial function significantly and to a clinically important extent."

The aims of our studies were to determine the prevalence of this in a controlled population and to investigate the potential for a causal relationship between the two entities by determining whether therapy of OSA altered GER parameters, and vice versa. All patients presenting to our sleep laboratory for screening polysomnography underwent distal esophageal pH monitoring simultaneously with polysomnography. Control subjects were selected if the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was <5.0, and patients were selected if AHI was >15.0. Fourteen subjects with OSA undertook a second polysomnographic study including distal esophageal pH monitoring, with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) intervention. Twelve subjects with proven OSA took part in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel group study of the effect of antireflux therapy (nizatidine) on OSA parameters. In 63 patients and 41 controls, we found that patients with OSA had significantly more GER events than controls as measured by number of reflux events over 8 hours (115 vs 23; P <0.001), and percent of time spent at pH <4.0 (21.4% vs 3.7%; P <0.001). In patients with proven OSA, 53.4% of GER episodes were temporally related to apneas or hypopneas. Less than half (46.8%) of all apneas were temporally related to acid reflux, and only 43.8% of arousals were related to reflux events. In the therapeutic trials, nCPAP reduced GER parameters in both patients with OSA and without OSA, suggesting a nonspecific effect. Antireflux therapy (nizatidine) reduced arousals but not apnea-hypopnea index in patients with OSA. Patients with OSA have a higher prevalence of GER than matched control subjects. Nasal CPAP reduces GER parameters nonspecifically, and thus the role of OSA in the pathogenesis of GER remains unclear. GER, however is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of arousals, but there is no evidence that it is involved in the pathogenesis of apneas."

We analysed the breathing pattern during sleep in forty patients while CPAP was administered. A regular breathing pattern throughout the sleep study was observed in 15 patients. In the remaining 25 subjects, one or more of the following events was observed: central apnoeas, hypopnoeas, periodic breathing, prolonged oxyhaemoglobin desaturations. Central apnoeas during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep appeared almost exclusively after arousals or wakefulness periods; their prevalence did not significantly differ between subjects who showed and who did not show similar events before CPAP. Central apnoeas in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep had a random occurrence. Hypopnoeas were found only in REM sleep, and, like central apnoeas, occurred randomly; in one patient they had a prolonged duration (up to 110 s). Periodic breathing was observed in only two subjects, one of whom had congestive heart failure: it was limited to NREM sleep and was not associated with arousals or shifts in sleep stage. Prolonged oxyhaemoglobin desaturations were found mainly in REM sleep; most subjects with such abnormalities had daytime blood gas alterations. In conclusion, abnormalities of the breathing pattern of patients with OSAS can be observed during CPAP and after tracheostomy, but periodic breathing is less common than is reported after tracheostomy, and is probably caused by different mechanisms."

Two studies compared nasal mask with the Oracle oral mask and showed no significant difference in compliance at one month (mean difference [95%CI]: 0.17 hours per night [-0.54 to 0.87]). There were also no significant differences in any of the physiological parameters (e.g. AHI, arousal index, minimum oxygen saturation), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), or symptoms of OSA. A single study comparing nasal mask with nasal pillows showed a significant difference in compliance when expressed as the percentage of days used in favour of nasal pillows (nasal pillows mean+/-SD 94.1+/-8.3%; nasal mask 85.7+/-23.5%, P=0.02), however there were no significant differences in the mean daily use for all days or when use was greater than 0 minutes per day. Nasal pillows were also associated with fewer overall adverse effects (P<0.001) and greater interface satisfaction (P=0.001). No significant differences in AHI, ESS or quality of life scores were seen. One study comparing nasal mask with face mask showed that compliance was significantly greater with use of a nasal mask (mean difference 1.0 hour per night [95%CI 0.3-1.8]).

The face mask can not be recommended as a first line interface, but may be considered if nasal obstruction or dryness limits the use of a nasal mask. Further randomised studies comparing the different forms of CPAP delivery interface now available for the treatment of OSA, in larger groups of patients and for longer durations, are required."

We have previously shown that the activity of both the genioglossus (GGEMG) and tensor palatini (TPEMG) are decreased at sleep onset, and that this decrement in muscle activity is greater in the apnoea patient than in healthy controls. We have also previously shown this decrement to be greater in older men when compared with younger ones. In order to explore the mechanisms responsible for this decrement in muscle activity nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was applied to reduce negative pressure mediated muscle activation. We then investigated the effect of sleep onset (transition from predominantly alpha to predominantly theta EEG activity) on ventilation, upper airway muscle activation and upper airway resistance (UAR) in middle-aged and younger healthy men. We found that both GGEMG and TPEMG were reduced by the application of nasal CPAP during wakefulness, but that CPAP did not alter the decrement in activity in either muscle seen in the first two breaths following an alpha to theta transition. However, CPAP prevented both the rise in UAR at sleep onset that occurred on the control night, and the recruitment in GGEMG seen in the third to fifth breaths following the alpha to theta transition. Further, GGEMG was higher in the middle-aged men than in the younger men during wakefulness and was decreased more in the middle-aged men with the application of nasal CPAP. No differences were seen in TPEMG between the two age groups. These data suggest that the initial sleep onset reduction in upper airway muscle activity is due to loss of a 'wakefulness' stimulus, rather than to loss of responsiveness to negative pressure. In addition, it suggests that in older men, higher wakeful muscle activity is due to an anatomically more collapsible upper airway with more negative pressure driven muscle activation. Sleep onset per se does not appear to have a greater effect on upper airway muscle activity as one ages."

We have previously shown that during wakefulness, the activity of both the genioglossus (GGEMG) and tensor palatini (TPEMG) is greater in patients with OSA compared with controls. Further, EMG activity decreases at sleep onset, and the decrement is greater in apnoea patients than in healthy controls. In addition, it is known that the prevalence of OSA is greater in middle-aged compared with younger men. Thus, we had two goals in this study. First we compared upper airway muscle activity between young and middle-aged healthy men compared with men with OSA. We also explored the mechanisms responsible for the decrement in muscle activity at sleep onset in these groups. We investigated muscle activity, ventilation , and upper airway resistance (UAR) during wakefulness and sleep onset (transition from alpha to EEG activity) in all three groups. Measurements were obtained during basal breathing (BB) and nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was applied to reduce negative pressure-mediated muscle activation). We found that during wakefulness there was a gradation of GGEMG and UAR (younger < older < OSA) and that muscle activity was reduced by the application of nasal CPAP (to a greater degree in the OSA patients). Although CPAP eliminated differences in UAR during wakefulness and sleep, GGEMG remained greater in the OSA patients. During sleep onset, a greater initial fall in GGEMG was seen in the OSA patients followed by subsequent muscle recruitment in the third to fifth breaths following the alpha to transition. On the CPAP night, and GGEMG still fell further in the OSA patients compared with control subjects. CPAP prevented the rise in UAR at sleep onset along with the associated recruitment in GGEMG. Differences in TPEMG among the groups were not significant. These data suggest that the middle-aged men had upper airway function midway between that of young normal men and the abnormal airway of those with OSA. Furthermore it suggests that the initial sleep onset reduction in upper airway muscle activity is due to loss of a 'wakefulness' stimulus, rather than to loss of responsiveness to negative pressure, and that this wakefulness stimulus may be greater in the OSA patient than in healthy controls."

            "abstract": "The sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is characterised by daytime sleepiness, cardiorespiratory and cognitive disorders, secondary to repeated episodes of obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. This disease is highly prevalent in the general population and has damaging effects on the cardiovascular system; it increases the incidence of traffic accidents due to excessive somnolence, reduces the quality of life and is associated with an excess of mortality. It usually affects obese patients and the most important symptoms are snoring and repeated respiratory pauses. With each apnea and/or hypopnea there is a fall in saturation that alters the nocturnal average and ends up causing serious cardiovascular problems in the medium to long term. The destructuring of the architecture of sleep leads to daytime sleepiness that can interfere in social and working life. Diagnosis is carried out by means of polysomnography or respiratory poligraphy, an abbreviated method that is valid for 75% of cases. The most efficient medical treatment is the application of positive pressure to the airway (Continuous positive airway pressure - CPAP) that has scarce and light secondary effects and is in general well-tolerated. Once adapted, the patient must carry out an adjustment of the pressure through polysomnography and with the autoCPAP, which can vary pressure until the respiratory events are corrected. Primary care has an essential role to play in suspicion of the clinical symptoms, the correct utilisation of the referral criteria and the control of patients receiving treatment once adapted."

Importantly, individuals with cardiovascular disease have a higher prevalence yet they often have few symptoms to alert clinicians to its presence. OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥15 events/hour is present in ≥30% of patients with primary hypertension and in up to 80% of those with drug resistant hypertension, suggesting that the neural, hormonal, inflammatory and vascular cascades triggered by OSA may elevate blood pressure chronically. The purpose of this review is to summarize: (1) the epidemiology of OSA and its relation to cardiovascular risk; (2) potential mechanisms by which OSA could promote conditions known to increase the risk of hypertension or contribute to its development and progression; (3) evidence for and against a pro-hypertensive effect of OSA; and, (4) the impact of treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on blood pressure and blood pressure-related morbidities. The prevailing view that the effect of treatment on blood pressure is modest arises from the inability of most contemporary technology to measure accurately the true impact of CPAP on OSA-entrained surges in nocturnal blood pressure. Moreover the exclusive focus on blood pressure, as if this is the principal determinant of cardiovascular event rates in this population, is naïve. The capacity to reduce cardiovascular risk by treating OSA with CPAP likely transcends a simple blood pressure effect; formal testing of this hypothesis will require adequately powered randomized clinical trials."

(P)RR was shown to be involved in pathophysiology of cardiovascular and renal diseases. Soluble (pro)renin receptor (s(P)RR), which is generated by furin from full length (P)RR, is present in blood. The aim of the present study is to clarify the association of plasma s(P)RR levels and the severity of OSAS. Plasma levels of s(P)RR were measured by ELISA in 58 male patients diagnosed as OSAS based on polysomnography, and 14 age-matched male control subjects. Blood samples were obtained at 6:00 a.m. just after overnight polysomnography. Plasma s(P)RR levels were significantly higher in patients with OSAS (9.0±2.0 ng/mL, mean ± SD) than in control subjects (7.4±1.5 ng/mL) (P=0.0026). Plasma s(P)RR levels showed a significant negative correlation with % stage rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (r=-0.377, p<0.005), and significant positive correlations with % stage 1 (r=0.374, p<0.005), arousal index (r=0.341, p<0.01), apnea hypopnea index (AHI) (r=0.352, p<0.01) and desaturation index (r=0.302, p<0. 05). In 12 OSAS patients with AHI ≥20, plasma levels of s(P)RR were studied after 3-month treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). Plasma s(P)RR levels were significantly decreased after the nCPAP treatment (p=0.0016). The present study has shown for the first time elevated plasma s(P)RR levels in patients with OSAS. Plasma s(P)RR levels were associated with the severity of OSAS. Soluble (P)RR may serve as a plasma marker reflecting the severity of OSAS."

OSA tends to be associated with components of metabolic syndrome sharing a common ground of metabolic changes with metabolic syndrome itself. Recent studies showed that subjects with OSA were 6-9 times more likely to have metabolic syndrome than subjects without OSA. Intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation in OSA can initiate intermediary mechanisms (oxidative stress, neurohumoral changes, inflammation) leading to the components of metabolic syndrome. OSA has been suggested to be a novel risk factor, inside the metabolic syndrome, contributing to increased cardiovascular risk. Several studies report that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment can reverse pathophysiological changes in OSA, increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing blood pressure. Recent evidences show that CPAP treatment reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in subjects with OSA. Some subjects with metabolic syndrome can be affected by undiagnosed OSA: CPAP treatment could significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in this subgroup of patients."

            "abstract": "Data from animal and human studies provide a biological plausibility to the notion that obstructive sleep apnea activates pathways that lead to insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and hypertension. Sleep apnea thus activates the same pathways as does obesity. That obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease is supported by epidemiological association studies. Longitudinal cohort studies also provide evidence that patients with untreated severe sleep apnea have an increased rate of cardiovascular events. But these studies, while highly suggestive, do not provide the evidence needed to convince the skeptic. This would only be obtained by randomized treatment trials with hard cardiovascular endpoints such as cardiac events and deaths. While such studies are in the planning stages, they will be challenging. There are issues about randomizing individuals with severe sleep apnea and excessive sleepiness into no therapy, since they are at known increased risk for car crashes. Thus, lack of therapy puts others on the road at risk as well as the subject with sleep apnea. There is, moreover, the concern that treating obstructive sleep apnea in very obese individuals will have little impact, since any effect of therapy for OSA will be overwhelmed by the effects of obesity itself. Data from randomized treatment trials for cardiovascular endpoints will likely not be available for many years. In the interim, physicians need to consider how to treat such patients. It is proposed that given that CPAP treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is highly effective and essentially totally safe, and that the evidence is suggestive that sleep apnea is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, then we propose all patients with severe sleep apnea should be treated to reduce cardiovascular risk."

The ability to understand these reasons, easily identify them in individual patients, and develop therapies that target one or more of these reasons are the keys to unlocking new approaches for the treatment of OSA. In line with this approach, recent advances in OSA pathogenesis using upper airway and respiratory phenotyping techniques have identified four key causes of OSA. A narrow or collapsible upper airway ('impaired anatomy') is the primary cause. However, the anatomical contribution to OSA varies substantially. Indeed, impairment in pharyngeal anatomy can be modest and in many patients (∼20%), pharyngeal collapsibility asleep is not different to people without OSA. Thus, non-anatomical factors or 'phenotypes' that modulate pharyngeal patency are crucial determinants of OSA for many people. These include impairment in pharyngeal dilator muscle control and function during sleep, increased propensity for awakening during airway narrowing (low respiratory arousal threshold) and respiratory control instability (high loop gain). Each phenotype is a potential therapeutic target. This review summarises the recent advances in the understanding of OSA pathogenesis according to a phenotypic approach, emerging tools to identify the phenotypes, and potential new therapeutic pathways and interventions to treat this common disorder."

An alternative approach could involve administering therapies targeting the non-anatomic causes.

CPAP pressure selected with conventional or daytime manual titration (7.5(2.2) cm H2O and 7.4(1.5) cm H2O, ns) were significantly lower (P< 0.001) than with AutoSet (9.4(1.6) cm H20. All groups showed similar decrease of sleepiness and hours of use of CPAP at 3 months of follow-up. Automatic and manual daytime PSG studies after sleep deprivation are useful for CPAP titration in unselected patients with SAHS. Pressure selected with AutoSet is significantly higher than with conventional daytime or nighttime titration, although not significant in terms of treatment compliance and symptom improvement."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular morbidity and may precipitate cardiac dysrhythmias. Uncontrolled reports suggest that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may reduce dysrhythmia frequency and resting heart rate. We undertook a randomised controlled trial of therapeutic CPAP and compared with a subtherapeutic control which included an exploration of changes in dysrhythmia frequency and heart rate. Values are expressed as mean (SD). Eighty-three men [49.5 (9.6) years] with moderate-severe OSA [Oxygen Desaturation Index, 41.2 (24.3) dips per hour] underwent 3-channel 24-h electrocardiograms during normal daily activities, before and after 1 month of therapeutic (n = 43) or subtherapeutic (n = 40) CPAP. Recordings were manually analysed for mean heart rate, pauses, bradycardias, supraventricular and ventricular dysrhythmias. The two groups were well matched for age, body mass index, OSA severity, cardiovascular risk factors and history. Supraventricular ectopics and ventricular ectopics were frequently found in 95.2% and 85.5% of patients, respectively. Less common were sinus pauses (42.2%), episodes of bradycardia (12%) and ventricular tachycardias (4.8%). Compared with subtherapeutic control, CPAP reduced mean 24-h heart rate from 83.0 (11.5) to 79.7 (9.8) (P < 0.002) in the CPAP group compared with a non-significant rise (P = 0.18) from 79.0 (10.4) to 79.9 (10.4) in the subtherapeutic group; this was also the case for the day period analysed separately. There was no significant change in the frequencies of dysrhythmias after CPAP. Four weeks of CPAP therapy reduces mean 24-h heart rate possibly due to reduced sympathetic activation but did not result in a significant decrease in dysrhythmia frequency."

The gold standard treatment option for moderate to severe OSA is considered continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). In case primary treatment with CPAP fails, a reevaluation of disease severity [by means of the apnea/hypopnea-index (AHI)] can be required. A subset of patients that prefer a CPAP alternative is still using CPAP until the reevaluation polysomnography (PSG), and a so-called washout effect is not ruled out.

It is unclear why SAHS patients obstruct their upper airways during sleep while others do not. We hypothesized that upper airway dilator muscle function may be impaired in SAHS patients and that chronic CPAP therapy may enhance upper airway function. We, therefore, examined the effects of upper airway negative pressure on reflex palatal muscle activity in 16 normal nonsnoring awake male subjects and 16 awake SAHS patients using electromyography. The application of negative upper airway pressure (0 to -12.5 cm H2O) caused increases in levator palatini (LP, p < 0.001) and palatoglossus (PG, p < 0.001) activity, 100 msec after pressure stimulus in normal subjects. Application of upper airway negative pressure in SAHS patients caused an increase in LP activity (p < 0.05) but not in PG activity. Reflex electromyographic response to negative pressure was reduced in SAHS patients compared to normal subjects for both muscles (p < 0.001). When the seven thinnest SAHS patients were compared with seven normal subjects matched for BMI and age, the SAHS patients still demonstrated impaired responses to negative pressure for both muscles (p < 0.001). A further eight SAHS patients were studied either while concurrently taking nightly CPAP therapy and also off CPAP (at least 3 nights). Chronic nightly CPAP therapy improved the reflex response of both LP (p < 0.001) and PG (p = 0.003) to nasal negative pressure application. Thus, untreated SAHS patients have impaired electromyographic responses to negative upper airway pressure suggesting impaired defence of the upper airway, which is improved by nightly CPAP therapy."

Diagnoses of OSA were established by simplified polygraphy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Data from 208 men and 71 women. The median age (interquartile range) was 51 years (41-59), with an Epworth Sleepiness Scale score of 13.5 (9-19), body mass index of 33 kg/m2 (29-38) and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) of 53 events/h (35-74). The APAP trial results included: hours used per night, 5.5 (4-7); 95th percentile pressure, 10.6 cm H2O (9.4-11.7); 95th percentile leak, 0.3 UL/sec (0.1-0.6); residual RDI, 6.2 events/h (3.9-11.4); and percentage change in RDI, 87% (74-93). The proportion of patients with residual RDI >10 events/h was 29% (95% CI 23.6-34.3). Adherence (> 70% of nights and > 4 h/night) was observed in 72.4% of subjects (95% CI 67-78). Patients with APAP adherence tended to require higher CPAP pressures, had higher rates of residual RDI, and had a lower percentage change in RDI than those with no adherence. As the 95th percentile CPAP pressure increased so too did residual RDI.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The APAP trial was effective in decreasing RDI with an acceptable adherence rate; however, residual OSAwas a frequent finding. Our results support that in up to one-third of patients evaluated by a simplified diagnostic approach, CPAP titration based on 95th percentile pressure may not be sufficient if residual RDI < 10 events/h is considered as a therapeutic target."

The gold standard diagnostic investigation for OSA is overnight laboratory-based polysomnography (sleep study), however, ambulatory models of care incorporating screening questionnaires and home sleep studies have been recently evaluated and are now being incorporated into routine clinical practice. Patients with OSA are very often obese and exhibit a range of comorbidities, such as hypertension, depression and diabetes. Management, therefore, needs to be based on a multidisciplinary and holistic approach which includes lifestyle modifications. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line therapy for severe OSA. Oral appliances should be considered in patients with mild or moderate disease, or in those unable to tolerate CPAP. New, minimally invasive surgical techniques are currently being developed to achieve better patient outcomes and reduce surgical morbidity. Successful long-term management of OSA requires careful patient education, enlistment of the family's support and the adoption of self-management and patient goal-setting principles."

            "title": "A review of oral devices in the treatment of habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea.",
            "abstract": "With recent interest in sleep apnoea, oral devices have been proposed and used increasingly to treat patients suffering from snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Numerous case reports have been published and studies have been carried out to determine the efficiency and mechanism of action as well as evaluate side effects, complications and costs of different oral devices in the treatment of habitual snoring and OSA. A summary of the scientific basis and current opinions regarding oral devices in the treatment of habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea is presented in this article. The selection of papers was based on a computerised search of published clinical and associated studies identified by MEDLINE from 1980 to November 2000. Although there is not yet enough scientific evidence for the clinician to determine which appliance is most likely to improve symptoms for a given patient, it appears from the literature that dental devices may have a place in the treatment of habitual snoring and mild and moderate cases of OSA. However, most of the studies are case series, raising questions on validity, and few studies use appropriate control groups. The general opinion is that these patients should not be treated without a sleep study as the OSA must be diagnosed before beginning treatment with oral devices to identify patients at risk and to provide a baseline to establish the effectiveness of the treatment. The main advantages of oral devices is the relative simplicity of the treatment, its reversibility and cost-effectiveness, and the fact that they can be used as an alternate treatment in patients who are unable to tolerate nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or who are poor surgical risks. Side effects occur in a significant proportion of patients using the MAD. In most cases these are minor and their importance must be balanced against the efficacy of the MAD in treating snoring and OSA. n."

            "abstract": "Prevalence rates of atrial fibrillation (AF) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) are rising on a global scale. Epidemiological data have consistently demonstrated an independent association between the 2 conditions. Investigators pose that pathophysiologic features of OSA enable progression of the AF substrate; these features include abnormalities of gas exchange, autonomic remodeling, atrial stretch, and inflammation. Furthermore, many of the mechanistic perturbations that impact the AF substrate in OSA can be substantially attenuated by effective treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Clear associations of OSA treatment and improved AF control have been observed across multiple clinical contexts. However, the precision and generalizability of these findings are unclear in view of the data's observational nature. Although risk factor management has emerged as a critical component of AF treatment, effective control of many AF risk factors can be challenging in the longer term. In view of the efficacy and sustainability of CPAP therapy, OSA raises its profile as a prime candidate for intervention. However, translation of this strategy to the broader framework for AF management requires robust data from randomized controlled trials."

            "abstract": "The relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and nasal obstruction is unclear. In order to better understand, we performed an extensive computer-assisted review and analysis of the medical literature on this topic. Data were grouped into reports of normal control subjects, patients with isolated nasal obstruction, and those with SDB. We conclude that SDB can both result from and be worsened by nasal obstruction. Nasal breathing increases ventilatory drive and nasal occlusion decreases pharyngeal patency in normal subjects. Nasal congestion from any cause predisposes to SDB. Although increased nasal resistance does not always correlate with symptoms of congestion, nasal congestion typically results in a switch to oronasal breathing that compromises the airway. Moreover, oral breathing in children may lead to the development of facial structural abnormalities associated with SDB. We postulate that the switch to oronasal breathing that occurs with chronic nasal conditions is a final common pathway for SDB."

Researchers are also exploring the potential role for a wider range of health-care providers, including trained nurses and general practitioners, in the primary management of OSA. Recent randomized, controlled studies evaluating the clinical effectiveness of ambulatory management strategies versus traditional laboratory-based care for patients with OSA have consistently demonstrated that comparable patient outcomes can be achieved.

CPAP eliminates the acute elevation of blood pressure (BP) that occurs during a night of obstructive apneas. In longer term studies hypertensive patients showed a fall in mean BP from baseline with CPAP both by day and by night. Noncompliant patients do not achieve this benefit and BP does not change in normotensive patients with OSA on CPAP. On the other hand, left ventricular mass does not seem to change in hypertensive OSA patients despite reduction in blood pressure. Some of the benefit in BP reduction may relate to other interventions such as successful weight loss. Clear answers as to the effects of intervention are difficult because of confounding factors such as antihypertensive medication and length of follow up as well as questions of compliance with treatment. Multicenter trials are being currently undertaken but will need some years to yield answers."

The mean AHI decreased with CPAP to 59.50%, but decreased only 38.91% with the AMP device. The lowest mean recorded oxygen saturation level for the 21 subjects was 84.30 before treatment, 91.10 after CPAP treatment, and 90.20 after AMP treatment. Sleep data revealed a significant decrease in stage 1 and 2 (p=0.0088) and an increase in rapid eye movement percent (p=0.0066) for both treatments when compared with baseline. Three- to 10-month posttreatment phone interviews showed that 1 subject was not using either device, 1 subject was using CPAP, and 2 subjects were using the AMP device intermittently due to occasional temporomandibular joint pain symptoms. The remaining 17 subjects were all using the AMP device nightly. The symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness also decreased significantly by both AMP and CPAP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The AMP device achieved substantial success in most cases, but was less effective than CPAP, especially for the more severe cases.

Epidemiological studies have established these associations, and there are now numerous experimental and clinical studies which have provided information on the possible underlying mechanisms. Mechanistic proof-of-concept studies with surrogate endpoints have been performed to demonstrate that treatment of OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has the potential to reverse or at least to attenuate not only OSA but also the adverse cardiovascular effects associated with OSA. However, no randomized studies have been performed to demonstrate that treatment of OSA by CPAP improves clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and/or established cardiovascular disease and concomitant OSA. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of OSA as a potential cardiovascular risk factor, the impact of OSA on cardiac function, the role of OSA as a modifier of the course of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, and the insights from studies evaluating the impact of CPAP therapy on the cardiovascular features associated with OSA."

Studies on the effectiveness of this treatment have been challenged because of the lack of a suitable placebo. The recent description of a true placebo (sham CPAP) prompted us to conduct a randomized trial of CPAP or placebo to assess the effectiveness of CPAP in improving SAHS-related symptoms and daytime function in patients with moderate to severe SAHS. Forty-eight patients, stratified in four groups according to severity, were randomly allocated into two treatment groups (optimal and sham CPAP) for a 6-wk period. Of these, 45 completed follow-up (91% males; age: 54 +/- 10 yr; body mass index [BMI]: 32 +/- 6 kg/m(2); apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]: 54 +/- 19 events/h; and Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]: 16 +/- 5). The ESS, a questionnaire on SAHS-related symptoms, Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were completed at inclusion and after treatment. After 10 d of washout, the placebo group was treated with optimal CPAP and reassessed before and after optimal CPAP. The group receiving optimal CPAP when compared with the group with sham CPAP showed considerably greater improvement in the relief of sleepiness (-9.5 versus -2.3, p < 0.001), other SAHS-related symptoms (-18.5 versus -4.5, p < 0.001), vigilance (+8.5 versus +3.4, p = 0.009), and general productivity (+4.0 versus +0.5, p = 0.04) FOSQ scales. Both groups used a similar number of hours for the optimal and the sham CPAP (4.3 versus 4.5, (p = NS). The patients initially treated with placebo CPAP improved significantly more when optimal CPAP was applied for ESS (-2.3 versus -6.7, p < 0.001) and other sleep apnea syndrome (SAS)-related symptoms (-4.5 versus -11.2, p = 0.02). Our study provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of CPAP treatment in improving symptoms and perceived health status in moderate to severe SAHS."

            "abstract": "Surgery is widely considered to be the first-line therapy for \"simple\" snoring and moderate sleep apnea syndrome. Surgical treatment of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is currently generally considered to be second-line therapy after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. Many patients, however, find difficulty in complying with the continued long-term demands of CPAP treatment and seek a more definitive one-off solution to their sleep-related problem. Surgical therapy has been found useful for snoring, at least on subjective grounds; this has incited patient demand and led surgeons to expand its use for upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) and possibly OSA. In this paper the surgical procedures of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), nasal surgery, and maxillofacial surgery are discussed and analyzed as they relate to the resolution of snoring, UARS, and OSA. There are many methodological problems in the published literature that make this analysis difficult. We feel that surgical therapy should be comparable to CPAP therapy, fulfilling the same analytical criteria in regard to measurement of severity and improvement of the disorder, as well as an equally sustained effect. Operative risk and side effects need to be clearly stated. Guidelines for future data collection and clinical trials of surgical procedures are proposed, and we recommend randomized prospective multicenter protocols and a registry of patients undergoing surgery for OSA so that long-term follow-up can be achieved."

Although split night polysomography (PSG(SN)) algorithms can establish a diagnosis of OSA/H and establish a positive pressure prescription for many patients, there has been only limited evidence that this strategy does not impair acceptance and adherence to treatment. The objective of this study was to test the null hypothesis that PSG(SN) does not adversely impact acceptance and adherence to positive pressure therapy for OSA/H compared with a standard two-night PSG strategy (PSG(TN)).\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective case-controlled study.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      University-based sleep disorders program\n    \n\n\n          Patients:\n        \n      \n      Both PSG(SN) and PSG(TN) (control) patients were selected on the basis of having an initial medical/sleep evaluation by a full-time physician member of the University of Pittsburgh Sleep Disorders Program, must not have had prior diagnostic PSG or treatment for sleep-disordered breathing, and must have been followed by the Sleep Program team. Selection of PSG(SN) patients required the ability to be matched with a control patient. Both groups underwent evaluation during the same time period. Of 146 patients who underwent PSG(SN) between October 1995 and September 1997, 51 had their initial evaluation and subsequent follow-up by physician-staff members of our Program. Of these, 15 were excluded from analysis because of a previous diagnostic PSG's or prior OSA/H therapy. Also, matches were unavailable for 5 patients. Seven patients refusal to use positive pressure at home and were not available for assessment of adherence, but were included in analysis of therapeutic acceptance. Thus, analysis of the impact of PSG(SN) on adherence to positive pressure therapy was based on a data set of 24 patients in whom a PSG(SN) was performed and 24 patients who had PSG(TN).

The nadir of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) during sleep was lower in the PSG(TN) than PSG(SN) group (69.3+/-15 vs. 79.8+/-9, mean+/-SD, p=0.012). During positive pressure titration, the time spent at the final pressure which was prescribed for the patients were comparable in both groups (123.4+/-64 vs. 161+/-96 minutes, PSG(SN) and PSG(TN), respectively, p=0.17). Adherence to therapy was objectively assessed by the average daily run-time of the positive pressure device at the first meter-read following initiation of treatment (55.1+/-44 vs. 40.8+/-16 days following home set-up, PSG(SN) and PSG(TN), respectively, p=0.14). Depending whether or not patients with previous exposure to positive pressure therapy were included in the analysis, 84-86% of patients undergoing PSG(SN) accepted therapy.

There are now \"intelligent\" NCPAP machines that try to find the ideal pressure for a patient by monitoring a combination of apnoeas, hypopnoeas, inspiratory flow limitation, and snoring.

However, these results were based on tests involving steady-state or quasi-steady measurements obtained in wakefulness. We have developed a method for assessing the dynamic stability characteristics of chemoreflex control in OSA patients during sleep. While continuous positive airway pressure was applied to stabilize the upper airways, acoustically stimulated arousals were used to perturb the respiratory system during sleep. The fluctuations in esophageal pressure that ensued were analyzed, using a closed-loop minimal model, to estimate the chemoreflex loop impulse response (CLIR). Tests using simulated data confirmed the validity of our estimation algorithm. Application of the method to arousal responses measured in six OSA and five normal subjects revealed no statistically significant differences in gain margins and loop gain magnitudes between the two groups. However, the CLIR in the OSA subjects exhibited faster and more oscillatory dynamics. This result implies that, in addition to unstable upper airway mechanics, an underdamped chemoreflex control system may be another important factor that promotes the occurrence of periodic obstructive apneas during sleep."

This paper reviews the cognitive profile of adults with OSA and discusses the relative role of altered sleep and hypoxemia in the aetiology of these cognitive deficits. Markers of cognitive dysfunctions such as those measured with waking electroencephalography and neuroimaging are also presented.

OSA is considered as mild with an AHI of 5-15, moderate with an AHI of 15-30, and severe with an AHI greater than 30. OSA is a highly prevalent disease since it should affect 7-15% of the middle-aged population, but most patients are not yet diagnosed for OSA. Middle age, male gender, obesity and arterial hypertension are main risk factors for OSA in adults. OSA patients are exposed to higher neurological and cardiovascular morbidity, including stroke, depression, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias. Because OSA may lead to life-threatening problems if undiagnosed, anaesthesiologists should be aware of their screening role in the preoperative period. In that way, the STOP-BANG questionnaire is a well-adapted instrument to screen patients for OSA during the preoperative visit. OSA patients are exposed to higher preoperative morbidity in relation with OSA severity, particularly difficult manual ventilation with mask, difficult tracheal intubation and postoperative upper airway obstruction. The unknown diagnosis of OSA is one major contributor to facilitate the occurrence of those events. In the postoperative period, early resuming continuous positive airway pressure and installing the OSA patient in a nonsupine position could be effective in preventing pharyngeal obstruction. Considering the timing of postoperative complications, a careful monitoring in the post-anesthesia care unit for three hours is an appropriate strategy for a majority of OSA patients. Alternatives to opioids should be promoted for postoperative pain control."

The immediate effects of n-CPAP were tested during a nighttime sleep study divided into two approximately equal parts (control and n-CPAP). Nasal CPAP of 5-10 cm H2O decreased apnea index (apneas per hour of sleep) (control 35.1, n-CPAP 5.7; p less than 0.001) and significantly improved oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2). The effect was independent of body weight and the presence of cardiorespiratory complications. However, in three patients with lung disease and markedly elevated PaCO2, significant sleep-related hypoxemia persisted at the relatively low pressures required to open the upper airway. Long-term home-based n-CPAP was offered to 11 patients. (One patient was considered unsuitable because of persisting profound sleep-related hypoxemia). Seven patients consented and were followed for periods ranging from 1 to 18 months. All patients reported dramatic reversal of daytime hypersomnolence; three complained of minor nasal stuffiness but compliance was good and only one stopped using the mask (after 12 months). Apnea index decreased following home use of n-CPAP (before 35.9, after 18.1; p less than 0.01) but overall respiratory instability (apnea + hypopnea) and SaO2 were not significantly improved. It is concluded that n-CPAP is a highly effective means of preventing upper airway occlusion in OSAS and, except for some patients with coexisting lung disease, it totally reverses the accompanying gas exchange disturbance. Long-term home-based n-CPAP therapy is acceptable to a majority of patients, is free of serious side effects, and appears to result in a partial reversal of the underlying breathing disorder."

To confirm these clinical impressions, we performed two consecutive days of 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, nocturnal esophageal pressure recording, and polysomnography on six OSAS patients complaining of regular nocturnal GER. On night one, the patients were untreated. Five of six subjects had abnormal amounts of nocturnal GER. Arousal, movement and swallowing were more frequent (p less than 0.043) and nadir intrathoracic pressure lower (p less than 0.005) in the 30 s prior to precipitous drops in esophageal pH (greater than or equal to 2 pH units) than during random control periods. A direct association between obstructive apneas and GER was not identified. On night two, nasal CPAP was administered and successfully treated apnea in five of six subjects. In these patients, there was also dramatic reduction in GER frequency and duration on CPAP. The mean percentage of time pH less than 4 dropped from 6.3 +/- 2.1 to 0.1 +/- 0.1 percent (p less than 0.025). We believe that OSAS may predispose to nocturnal GER by lowering intrathoracic pressure and increasing arousal and movement frequency. Nasal CPAP can correct these predisposing factors and reduce GER."

Sixteen obstructive sleep apnea patients and sixteen normal subjects were matched on age, sex, and body mass index. Pharyngeal collapsibility, defined by the critical pressure, was measured during sleep. The critical pressure was partitioned between its passive mechanical properties (passive critical pressure) and active dynamic responses to upper airway obstruction (active critical pressure). Compared with normal subjects, sleep apnea patients demonstrated elevated mechanical loads as demonstrated by higher passive critical pressures [-0.05 (SD 2.4) vs. -4.5 cmH2O (SD 3.0), P = 0.0003]. Dynamic responses were depressed in sleep apnea patients, as suggested by failure to lower their active critical pressures [-1.6 (SD 3.5) vs. -11.1 cmH2O (SD 5.3), P < 0.0001] in response to upper airway obstruction. Moreover, elevated mechanical loads placed some normal individuals at risk for sleep apnea. In this subset, dynamic responses to upper airway obstruction compensated for mechanical loads and maintained airway patency by lowering the active critical pressure. The present study suggests that increased mechanical loads and blunted neuromuscular responses are both required for the development of obstructive sleep apnea."

Comparison of the two devices regarding the effect on the subjective sleep quality parameters showed no differences. The AutoSet pressure outcomes correlated significantly better with Ppred in comparison with the SOMNOsmart. The P50 and P95 but not the Pmax values were significantly lower in the SOMNOsmart as compared with the AutoSet (P50: 5.1+/-1.3 vs 7.1 +/- 1.9 mbar, P<0.0001; P95: 7.8+/-3.0 vs 9.6+/-1.9 mbar, P<0.0005; Pmax: 10.0+/-3.4 vs 10.8+/-1.8 mbar, NS).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      While the subjective tolerance of the two APAP machines was comparable, these devices were characterized by different pressure profiles.

            "abstract": "The spectrum of respiratory sleep disorders has been extended in the last years to include conditions that are less well defined than severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Moderate OSA, snoring, and upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) represent three conditions in which there are still unresolved pathophysiological, epidemiological, and clinical questions. Therefore, the therapeutic approach remains unclear. We have tried to define these entities and to review the respective indications and efficacy of pharmacological treatment, weight loss, sleep posture, oral appliances, upper airway surgery, and finally, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). From these data, we also aim to define strategies of treatment for moderate OSA, snoring, and UARS. However, these conditions are likely to be particularly appropriate for randomized trials comparing different modalities of treatment that may be the only way to validate these treatment strategies."

A total 71 SAHS (apnoea/hypopnoea index > or = 15 h(-1)) patients completed a randomised, parallel group study over 3 months using utilities derived by the standard gamble approach (Usg) and European quality of life questionnaire (Euroqol) (Ueq).

The Ueq showed a marginal change with CPAP (0.73 to 0.77) but did not demonstrate any improvement with lifestyle intervention.

Our algorithm, based on fuzzy logic, emulates the less-than-crisp kind of decision-making generally employed at the human level. Three input variables were first derived on a breath-by-breath basis from respiratory airflow measurements. These were: (1) the relative duration of inspiratory flow limitation in each breath; (2) the degree of hypopnea relative to the past 15 breaths; and (3) the intensity of snoring. Using these descriptors as inputs, our fuzzy inference algorithm produced a \"severity index\" (SI) quantifying the degree of SDB. Severity index was determined in CPAP titration procedures conducted on one normal snorer and 12 patients with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. SI computed over the last 6 minutes of each CPAP level was compared against other more-conventional indices of SDB, such as total pulmonary resistance (RL), the number of apneas and hypopneas (NAH), and the number of arousals (NAr). In all but one of the subjects, the correlation coefficients for SI vs each of RL, NAH, and NAr were significantly different from zero, but not different from each other. The group correlation coefficients for SI vs RL, NAH, and NAr were 0.89, 0.86, and 0.87, respectively, demonstrating that SI accurately quantifies SDB. SI collapses multiple features of the airflow pattern into a single index and, therefore, may be useful as a \"feedback\" variable for the automatic control of CPAP therapy."

All 48 patients had normal pulmonary function (simple spirometry) prior to study entry and had no history of asthma or allergies. The prevalence of BH was prospectively assessed by giving each subject a methacholine challenge test (MCT). Patients with a positive MCT were treated with 2-3 months of nasal CPAP treatment, after which they had a second MCT. Four of 16 patients in group I had BH on MCT (PD20 = 88, 103, 109, 162 D.U.), whereas none of the group II or III subjects demonstrated BH. There was no correlation between BH and the severity of the OSAS. The 4 patients with BH in group I showed an increase in PD20M after 2-3 months of nasal CPAP treatment. In conclusion, BH may occur in patients with OSAS. It is unrelated to the severity of the OSAS, and nasal constant positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy can decrease the hyperreactivity to methacholine in these patients."

Since optimal CPAP titration is essential to maintain compliance, it is important to elucidate the factors that help to determine the optimal pressure. However, the determinants of the optimal CPAP level are controversial. The subjects comprised 27 Japanese male patients with OSAS who underwent standard polysomnography (PSG), pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, cephalometry and CPAP titration. Twenty normal controls also underwent cephalometric analysis. The apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), mean oxygen saturation (mean SaO2) and the lowest SaO2 during sleep were found to be 54.7+/-22.6, 89.0+/-5.6%, and 69.7+/-9.0%, respectively by PSG. The mean optimal CPAP was 9.6+/-1.8 cmH2O. The cephalometric angles (SNA, SNB and NSBa) were similar to those found in the control subjects. but MP-H, and PNS-P were significantly longer than those in the control subjects as shown by cephalometry. The optimal CPAP was correlated with the mean SaO2 (P<0.0001), neck circumference (P<0.05) and three cephalometric variables (NSBa: P<0.01, MP-H: P<0.05, PNS-P: P<0.05). Multiple, step-wise, regression analysis showed that the mean SaO2 and NSBa were independent variables that best predicted the optimal CPAP. These variables accounted for 57.5% of the total variance (R2=0.575, P<0.001). Optimal CPAP was closely correlated with oxygen desaturation during sleep. However, the craniofacial structure had additional effects such as an independent factor in determining the optimal CPAP level."

Without loss of weight or change in respiratory mechanics, the ventilatory disturbance index fell from a mean of 87 events per hour to 57 events per hour (p < 0.0001), correlating with an improvement in mean nocturnal desaturation with sleep-disordered breathing events (r = 0.54, p = 0.03). Moreover, the daytime PaO2 rose significantly from a mean of 69 mm Hg to a mean of 82 mm Hg (P = 0.0001) at follow-up. The rise in daytime PaO2 was not only due to the alleviation of daytime hypercapnea observed in eight of nine hypercapneic subjects since the P(A-a)O2 gradient also decreased significantly. The improvement in PaO2 correlated significantly with the number of months of CPAP therapy, suggesting a continuing effect over time (r = 0.58, p = 0.015). These results indicate that there is a reversible element of the severity of OSA and suggest a result of nasal CPAP therapy may be to reverse the adverse and time-dependent effects of hypoxemia and sleep fragmentation on ventilatory control in severe OSA."

LBPP was applied by inflating anti-shock trousers wrapped around both legs to 40 mmHg. UA collapsibility was assessed by determining UA critical closing pressure (P crit) during application of different negative airway pressures. P crit and leg fluid volume were measured at baseline and after 5 min during both periods. LBPP caused a significant increase in P crit associated with a reduction in leg fluid volume. We conclude that rostral fluid displacement by LBPP increases UA collapsibility in healthy men, suggesting that fluid shift into the neck could increase UA collapsibility during sleep and thereby predispose patients with fluid overload states to obstructive sleep apnea."

Control of normal breathing during sleep relies upon finely coordinated anatomical and physiological mechanisms and their destabilization leads to central apnea. The causes of central sleep apnea can be classified into 4 groups: neurologic disorders, periodic breathing, upper airway abnormalities, and idiopathic syndromes. Clinical features result from the interaction between the underlying disorder and control of respiration. Two different prototypes emerge: patients who are hypercapnic (central hypoventilation and/or impaired respiratory mechanics) and those who are eucapnic or hypocapnic (periodic breathing and idiopathic hyperventilation). The causes and severity of apnea can be determined by clinical assessment, pulmonary function testing, and overnight polysomnography. Further management involves specific treatment of the underlying condition and reducing the sequelae of recurrent apneas during sleep, namely cardiorespiratory dysfunction and sleep disruption.

            "abstract": "To determine the etiology of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children with cerebral palsy (CP), a survey using a questionnaire was conducted on parents of 233 CP children (1-5 years old, mean age: 2.7) and on those of 343 control children during a routine medical check-up at the age of three. The prevalence of habitual snoring and nasal obstruction was 63 and 20% in CP children, which were significantly higher than in control children. Sleep apnea episodes and stridor were noted in 19.7 and 15.4% of CP children. A screening sleep study was performed using Apnomonitor II and a pulseoximeter (Pulsox 5) in 48 CP children whose questionnaires revealed habitual snoring and sleep apnea, and it was found that 27 and 58% of the children had on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of greater than 5 and a low level of SaO2 (LSaO2) of less than 85%, respectively. When another 10 CP children visited our hospital for treatment of severe OSA, precise evaluations including pharyngeal pressure and fiberscopic examination during sleep as well as a sleep study using an inductive prezysmograph (Respigraph) were performed. Adenoid and/or tonsillar hypertrophy were noted in only 4 children, and the main cause of sleep apnea in the other 6 children was pharyngeal collapse at the lingual base. Their OSA was successfully treated by adenotonsillectomy in 2 children, adenotomy in 2 children, UPPP and lingualplasty in 1 child, tracheostomy in 2 children, and nasal CPAP in 1 child. Before treatment of OSA in CP children, precise evaluation is recommended in order to perform appropriate treatment."

            "abstract": "A common clinical dilemma faced by sleep physicians is in deciding the level of severity at which patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) should be treated. There is particular uncertainty about the need for, and the effectiveness of, treatment in mild cases. To help define the role of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment in mild OSA we undertook a randomized controlled cross-over trial of CPAP in patients with an apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) of 5 - 30 (mean, 12.9 +/- 6.3 SD). Twenty-four-hour blood pressure and neurobehavioral function were measured at baseline, after 8 wk of treatment with CPAP, and after 8 wk of treatment with an oral placebo tablet. Twenty-eight of 42 patients enrolled in the study completed both treatment arms. Baseline characteristics were not different between those who completed the study and those who did not complete the study. Patients used CPAP for a mean (SD) of 3.53 (2.13) h per night and the mean AHI on the night of CPAP implementation was 4.24 (2.9). Nasal CPAP improved self-reported symptoms of OSA, including snoring, restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and irritability (in-house questionnaire), more than did placebo, but did not improve objective (Multiple Sleep Latency Test) or subjective (Epworth Sleepiness Scale) measures of daytime sleepiness. We found no benefit of CPAP over placebo in any tests of neurobehavioral function, generic SF-36 (36-item Short Form Medical Outcomes Survey) or sleep-specific (Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire) quality of life questionnaires, mood score (Profile of Moods States and Beck Depression Index), or 24-h blood pressure. However, the placebo tablet resulted in a significant improvement in a wide range of functional variables compared with baseline. This placebo effect may account for some of the treatment responses to CPAP observed previously in patients with mild OSA."

Ten bus drivers with OSAS and their matched controls participated in the study. The Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT) and a monotonous on-road driving task were completed. Eyeblink duration and frequency and speed control were measured while driving. Lane-keeping was evaluated by the supervisor in the car. Subsequent to these tasks, drivers with OSAS received continuous positive airway pressure treatment (nasal CPAP). After nine weeks of treatment, the tasks were repeated. Prior to treatment the average blink duration in the driving task was significantly longer and sleep latency in the MWT was significantly shorter for bus drivers with OSAS than for controls (mean blink duration 82.3 ms; 51.9 ms and mean sleep latency 23.2 min; 35.4 min), indicating increased daytime sleepiness. Subsequent to treatment both measures in drivers with OSAS decreased to the level of the controls. Treatment effects in MWT and blink duration in on-road driving also correlated significantly. No significant differences between the groups appeared in average blink frequency or driving performance in terms of maintenance of speed. No significant lane drifting appeared either. These results support earlier findings on blink duration as an indicator of increased sleepiness and have important implications for those involved in the transport technological industry.

It is associated with reduced health-related quality of life, higher healthcare utilization, and a poor prognosis. Whilst continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the treatment of choice for patients with daytime sleepiness due to OSA, the optimal management of CSA remains uncertain. There is much circumstantial evidence that the treatment of OSA in HF patients with CPAP can improve symptoms, cardiac function, biomarkers of cardiovascular disease, and quality of life, but the quality of evidence for an improvement in mortality is weak. For systolic HF patients with CSA, the CANPAP trial did not demonstrate an overall survival or hospitalization advantage for CPAP. A minute ventilation-targeted positive airway therapy, adaptive servoventilation (ASV), can control CSA and improves several surrogate markers of cardiovascular outcome, but in the recently published SERVE-HF randomized trial, ASV was associated with significantly increased mortality and no improvement in HF hospitalization or quality of life. Further research is needed to clarify the therapeutic rationale for the treatment of CSA in HF. Cardiologists should have a high index of suspicion for sleep-disordered breathing in those with HF, and work closely with sleep physicians to optimize patient management."

This study examines the nature of the impairment during simulated steering in patients with OSA, compared to normal subjects following either sleep deprivation or alcohol ingestion. Twenty-six patients with OSA and 12 normal subjects, either deprived of one night's sleep or following alcohol ingestion [mean (SD) alcohol blood level 71.6 mg dl(-1) (19.6)], performed a simulated steering task for a total of 90 min. Performance was measured using the tendency to wander (SD), deterioration across the task, number of 'off-road' events and the reaction time to peripheral events. Control data for OSA, sleep deprivation and alcohol were obtained following treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), after a normal night of sleep, and following no alcohol, respectively. Patients with untreated OSA, and sleep-deprived or alcohol-intoxicated normal subjects performed significantly less well, compared to their respective controls (P<0.01 for all tests), with untreated OSA lying between that of alcohol intoxication and sleep deprivation. Alcohol impaired steering error equally throughout the whole drive, whilst sleep deprivation caused progressive deterioration through the drive, but not initially. Untreated OSA was more like sleep deprivation than alcohol, although there was a wide spread of data. This suggests that the driving impairment in patients with OSA is more compatible with sleep deprivation or fragmentation as the cause, rather than abnormal cognitive or motor skills."

The average apnea-hypopnea index was 53.3/h in the \"diagnostic night,\" 5.8/h with CPAP, and 7.0/h with PRCPAP.

We examined the value of some devices according to the literature and our own results.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      The mandibular advancing devices aim at increasing upper airway diameter. The active part of the tongue extending device (SnorEx) is a stamp connected to a piston which exerts pressure at the base of the tongue causing its forward displacement; we studied 23 patients. The principle of an optically stimulating system (\"eye-cover\", Snore-Stop) consists of a microphone and light diods which are integrated in the eye-cover. After detecting acoustic signals (for example snoring) optical stimuli are generated in front of the eyes, which are thought to induce arousals causing a change of body position and the reduction of the snoring and apneas; we measured 24 patients. The principle of the tongue-retainer (Snore-Master) is the fixation of the tongue in a ventral position, which is thought to enlarge the mesopharyngeal area; we studied 14 patients. The nose plaster (Breathe-Right) contains an elastic spine that pulls the alae nasi cranial. This manipulation is thought to increase the diameter of the nostril and reduce the airway resistance. We measured 30 patients with obstructive sleep apnea and 20 snoring subjects without obstructive sleep apnea.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Regarding the mandibular advancing due to different appliance designs and study protocols variable success rates have been documented. In patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea a reduction of the sleep related breathing disorder could be shown. Non compliance (NC) to the tongue extending device was 75% (17/23). Non-compliance-patients were characterized by unacceptable local-side-effects of the prosthesis, lacking improvement of symptoms and of the respiratory disturbance index. Both tongue-retainer and -extensor are characterized by a high incidence of local side effects. Neither the eye-cover nor the nose plaster could improve the severity of obstructive sleep apnoe or snoring. In contrast to another study we could not show a significant effect of the tongue-retainer.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Neither the nose plaster nor the optical stimulating device influenced the degree of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. There are conflicting data regarding the tongue retainer. The high rate of non-compliant subjects and the low efficacy of the tongue extending prosthesis precludes large-scale use of this treatment modality in patients with obstructive sleep apnoe and snoring. In selected individuals suffering from a mild to moderate degree of obstructive sleep apnea with CPAP-inefficiency and -incompliance the mandibular advancing principle may be an therapeutic alternative to CPAP."

A total of 126 patients with moderate-severe OSA (apnea hypopnea index [AHI], 25.6 [SD 12.3]) were randomly assigned to a treatment order and 108 completed the trial with both devices. CPAP was more efficacious than MAD in reducing AHI (CPAP AHI, 4.5 ± 6.6/h; MAD AHI, 11.1 ± 12.1/h; P < 0.01) but reported compliance was higher on MAD (MAD, 6.50 ± 1.3 h per night vs. CPAP, 5.20 ± 2 h per night; P < 0.00001).

A total of 119 of 180 consecutive OSAHS patients were recruited to the study prior to initial CPAP titration. Patients completed psychological measures of health value, health locus of control (incorporating internality, chance, powerful others) and self-efficacy prior to CPAP titration. Objective adherence data were measured by CPAP unit time clocks and collected at 3-month follow-up. Average nightly use was calculated over this period. Logistic regression of prospective predictors of adherence produced a model comprising psychological (health value, internality, powerful others), as well as clinical variables (Epworth score, body mass index, apnoea/hypopnoea index, CPAP pressure). This model explained 24% of the variance in CPAP use, and correctly identified 75% of adherers and 53% of nonadherers. Although the psychological variables explained only a small amount of the overall variance in adherence behaviour, this result provides further support for the hypothesis that psychological variables contribute, in part, to continuous positive airway pressure adherence. Future research should focus on highlighting discrete variables, which may helpfully inform psychologically based interventions aimed at improving the use of continuous positive airway pressure by patients with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome at risk of discontinuance."

Fourteen patients (58%) were able to tolerate an OA for 3 months or more. Based on these results, we are hoping to achieve a better control of OSAS by combining nCPAP and other modalities."

The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with OSA have subclinical cardiovascular disease that is detectable by multi-modality cardiovascular imaging and whether these abnormalities improve after nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Of the 35 consecutive subjects with newly diagnosed moderate to severe OSA recruited from the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic, 20 patients were randomized to active vs. sham nCPAP. Active nCPAP was titrated to pressures that would prevent sleep disordered breathing based on inpatient polysomnography. OSA patients had baseline vascular function abnormalities including decreased myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR), brachial flow mediated dilation (FMD) and nitroglycerin-induced coronary vasodilation. Patients randomized to active nCPAP had improvement of MPR (1.5 ± 0.5 vs. 3.0 ± 1.3, p = 0.02) and brachial FMD (2.5% ± 5.7% vs. 9.0% ± 6.5%, p = 0.03) after treatment, but those randomized to sham nCPAP showed no significant improvement.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of CPAP in improving SAHS-related symptoms, daytime function, perceived health status, and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe SAHS. The effect of conservative treatment (CT) measures-sleep hygiene and weight loss- was compared with CT + CPAP. We included 105 consecutive patients (13 females, age 53 +/- 10 yr, body mass index [BMI] = 32 +/- 6 kg/m2, apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] = 56 +/- 20, Epworth sleepiness scale [ESS] = 12 +/- 5) who met our criteria for CPAP treatment. Patients were randomly allocated in two groups of similar characteristics. Group 1 (n = 37) was asked to improve sleep hygiene and started a weight loss program. Group 2 (n = 68) received, in addition, treatment with CPAP. Both groups were followed through weekly telephone calls and appointments. Sleepiness, other symptoms related to SAHS, daytime function, perceived health status, and quality of life were assessed through questionnaires at inclusion and after 3 mo of treatment. The relief of sleepiness and other SAHS-related clinical symptoms and improvement in perceived health status was much greater in Group 2 receiving CT + CPAP compared with Group 1, only receiving CT. The odds of experiencing a treatment response with CPAP + CT compared with CT alone was 6.52 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.51 to 17.6, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]). CPAP is currently the treatment of choice. At this time, the indication of CPAP treatment in moderate to severe SAHS is adequately supported."

            "abstract": "Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common disorder in both adults and children and is caused by the obstruction of the upper airway during sleep. Unlike adults, most cases of paediatric SDB are due to the presence of enlarged tonsils and adenoids, thus the main treatment option is adenotonsillectomy (T&A). It is well known that obstructive sleep apnoea in adults increases the risk for hypertension, coronary artery disease and stroke, and there is now mounting evidence that SDB also has a significant impact on the cardiovascular system in children with reports of elevated blood pressure, endothelial dysfunction and altered autonomic cardiovascular control. As there is now substantial evidence that elevated blood pressure in childhood is carried on to adulthood it is important to know if treatment of SDB improves cardiovascular outcomes. Studies in adults have shown that treatment of SDB leads to improvements in cardiovascular function, including a reduction in pulmonary artery pressure, systemic blood pressure and endothelial dysfunction. However, studies exploring the outcomes of treatment of SDB in children on the cardiovascular system are limited and varied in their methodology and outcome measures. As a number of cardiovascular disturbances are sequelae of SDB, early detection and management could result in the reduction of elevated blood pressure in children, and consequently a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity in adulthood. The aim of this review is to summarise the findings of studies to date which have investigated the cardiovascular outcomes in children treated for SDB and to make recommendations for future management of this very common disease."

We present data on the movement arousal index (MAI) in five groups of subjects: normals, simple snorers, patients with the sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS), and patients with sleep-related oxygen desaturations due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or neuromusculoskeletal disorders. In normal subjects, the MAI was 13 +/- 7 (mean +/- SD). MAI was distinctly increased in most patients with SAHS and was strongly correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index and loss of both slow wave and REM sleep. It was corrected to normal by nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). There was some overlap of MAI between SAHS patients and snorers, suggesting that a minority of nonapneic snorers may suffer from daytime sleepiness due to upper airway dysfunction. Sleep fragmentation is not a feature of sleep-related hypoventilation due to COPD or neuromusculoskeletal disorders, and an increase of the number of movement arousals (MA) is very suggestive of upper airway dysfunction and of potential success of CPAP. Quantification of sleep fragmentation is feasible and clinically useful; it should be included in the assessment of sleep-related breathing disorders."

Innovative, patient-centred interventions are, therefore, needed to enhance compliance. Due to its low cost and ubiquity, mobile health (mHealth) technology seems particularly suited for this purpose. We endeavoured to develop an mHealth application called \"APPnea,\" aimed at promoting patient self-monitoring of CPAP treatment. We then assessed the feasibility and acceptability of APPnea in a group of OSA patients. Methods Consecutive OSA patients used APPnea for six weeks. APPnea gave patients daily reminders to answer three questions about their OSA treatment (CPAP use, physical activity, and diet) and prompted them to upload their body weight weekly. Answers were saved to a secure server for further analysis. After completing the study, patients gave their anonymous opinions about APPnea. Results We enrolled 60 patients with OSA receiving CPAP treatment. The mean age was 56 ± 10 years and the apnoea-hypopnea index was 47 ± 25 events/hour. In total, 63% of participants completed the daily questionnaire for more than 66% of the study period. Objective CPAP compliance was generally high (5.3 ± 1.6 hours/night). In a subset of 38 patients naïve to CPAP, those who used APPnea regularly had significantly higher CPAP compliance. Satisfaction levels were high for the majority of users. Conclusion This mHealth intervention is not only feasible but also satisfactory to patients. Although larger randomized trials and cost-effectiveness studies should be performed, this study shows that APPnea could promote participation and improve compliance among patients with OSA, thereby improving outcomes."

All 12 patients treated with heated humidification improved in terms of the degree and frequency of upper airway dryness, and reported greater comfort when using the nCPAP device. All patients in the heated humidification group intending to terminate nCPAP therapy because of upper airway dryness persisted with nCPAP on addition of humidification.

Six patients of each treatment group were classified as having sleep stage- and body position-dependent obstructive breathing abnormalities according to the results of the baseline sleep study. After 3 weeks of treatment, the Epworth sleepiness score tended to be higher (p = 0.08) and the ability to stay awake lower (p = 0.02) in patients with dependent breathing abnormalities treated with fixed CPAP, than in the other patients.

Ten healthy volunteers served as the control population. Seven of the 10 OSAS patients were reexamined after 3 mo of therapy with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) mask ventilation.

Circadian variations in IL-1, IL-6, and gamma-IFN, and in the immunoregulatory hormones melatonin and cortisol, did not differ from those in the controls.

Patients randomized to telemonitored clinical care used CPAP an average of 4.1 +/- 1.8 hours per night, while the usual clinical care patients averaged 2.8 +/- 2.2 hours per night (P = .07). Telemonitored patients used CPAP on 78% +/- 22% of the possible nights, while usual care patients used CPAP on 60% +/- 32% of the nights (P = .07). No statistically significant differences between the groups were found on measures of CPAP efficacy, including measures of mask leak and the Apnea-Hypopnea Index. Patients in the telemonitored group rated their likelihood to continue using CPAP significantly higher than the patients in the usual care group. Patients in both groups were highly satisfied with the care they received and rated themselves as \"not concerned\" that their CPAP data were being wirelessly monitored.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Telemonitoring of CPAP compliance and efficacy data and rapid use of those data by the clinical sleep team to guide the collaborative (ie, patient and provider) management of CPAP treatment is as effective as usual care in improving compliance rates and outcomes in new CPAP users.

Positive airway pressure (PAP), a medical therapy for sleep apnea, reverses airway obstruction and may help reduce cardiovascular risk. Prior to planning large phase III randomized controlled trials to test the impact of PAP on cardiovascular outcomes, several gaps in knowledge need to be addressed. This article describes 2 independent studies that worked collaboratively to fill these gaps. The populations, design features, and relative benefits/challenges of the 2 studies (SleepTight and BestAIR) are described. Both studies were encouraged to have multidisciplinary teams with expertise in behavioral interventions to improve PAP compliance. Both studies provide key information that will be useful to the research community in future large-scale, event-driven, randomized trials to evaluate the efficacy and/or effectiveness of strategies to identify and treat significant OSA for decreasing risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients."

Data were analysed on 106 such patients (95 men, 11 women; mean age 55.6 [33-74] years). Their body-mass index was 31.5 +/- 5.5 kg/m2, the apnoea hypopnea index before adjustment 7.6 +/- 2.2 mbar. At the first control, after a median of 7.5 months, the pressure had to be adjusted in 55% of patients, by an average of 8.3 +/- 2.4 mbar (P < 0.001). At the second and third follow-ups (after 19.5 and 31.5 months, respectively), no further significant adjustment in mean pressure was necessary, while changes had to be made in 34.0% and 17.9%, respectively. Changes in body weight correlated with changes in pressure level (r = 0.4614 for difference between initial setting and first control; r = 0.6708 for first and second controls; r = 0.7013 for second and third controls). 61% of patients in whom mask pressure had to be altered had symptoms. Of those in whom the pressure had to be increased 82% had symptoms. Only 17% of patients requiring no change had symptoms. These findings indicate that patients on nCPAP must be monitored by polysomnography about 6 months after the initial setting, and further tests should be performed about a year apart. If body weight and feeling of well being are maintained, non-laboratory monitoring should be adequate."

All received a diagnostic polysomnogram and MSLT before treatment. The three groups had similar baseline values for nocturnal respiratory disturbance, oxygenation during sleep, fragmentation of sleep, and level of EDS. CPAP treatment was associated with a significant improvement in sleep-related respiration, oxygenation, and sleep fragmentation. The EDS showed significant improvement after one night, and further significant improvement after 14 nights, but no further significant improvement after 42 nights. The differential rate of improvement in nocturnal parameters compared with that of primary complaint of EDS suggests that OSAS patients experience a chronic functional sleep loss.

Twenty-three patients with newly diagnosed moderate-to-severe OSAS who had not yet started nasal CPAP treatment were prospectively enrolled. All of the subjects underwent simple spirometry and an overnight sleep study. Twenty-seven healthy individuals without OSAS were also recruited as the control group. Serum IL-23 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured before and after 3 months of CPAP therapy. There was no significant difference between moderate and severe OSAS patients in IL-23 and CRP, but both parameters were significantly higher than control group. The CPAP treatment produced a significant decrease in the levels of the inflammatory mediators CRP and IL-23 in patients. Changes in IL-23 were positively correlated with changes in AHI and in CRP.

During follow-up, sleep studies were conducted and measurements of the ejection fraction, exercise capacity, quality of life, and neurohormones were obtained.\n## RESULTS\nThree months after undergoing randomization, the CPAP group, as compared with the control group, had greater reductions in the frequency of episodes of apnea and hypopnea (-21+/-16 vs. -2+/-18 per hour, P<0.001) and in norepinephrine levels (-1.03+/-1.84 vs. 0.02+/-0.99 nmol per liter, P=0.009), and greater increases in the mean nocturnal oxygen saturation (1.6+/-2.8 percent vs. 0.4+/-2.5 percent, P<0.001), ejection fraction (2.2+/-5.4 percent vs. 0.4+/-5.3 percent, P=0.02), and the distance walked in six minutes (20.0+/-55 vs. -0.8+/-64.8 m, P=0.016). There were no differences between the control group and the CPAP group in the number of hospitalizations, quality of life, or atrial natriuretic peptide levels. An early divergence in survival rates without heart transplantation favored the control group, but after 18 months the divergence favored the CPAP group, yet the overall event rates (death and heart transplantation) did not differ (32 vs. 32 events, respectively; P=0.54).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nAlthough CPAP attenuated central sleep apnea, improved nocturnal oxygenation, increased the ejection fraction, lowered norepinephrine levels, and increased the distance walked in six minutes, it did not affect survival.

To find the optimal pressure, automatic systems were developed, permitting computerised titration of pressure based on respiratory patterns. One important point in the algorithm of titrating pressure is the shape of the inspiratory breath flow-time relation. It can be used to detect early inspiratory obstruction. In the present study the results of automatic CPAP titration were compared with conventional constant CPAP. In 12 patients with obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome two polysomnographies were performed after diagnosis and conventional titration. In a randomised cross-over study the adequate constant CPAP was compared with computerised variation of pressure by Autoset-CPAP. During both methods apnoeas, hypopnoeas and snoring were reduced. In the autoset mode the number of apnoeas and hypopnoeas was 30.14 +/- 17.6/sleeping time, in the constant mode it was 7.9 +/- 11.2/sleeping time (p < 0.01). The number of episodes with snoring in the autoset mode was 18.7 +/- 21.8 and in the constant pressure mode 7.9 +/- 11.2 (p = 0.054). No difference could be detected in respect of sleeping time, sleep efficiency, arousals and sleep stages.

Sixteen patients with SAHS were randomly allocated to two groups that were paired for age, apnea/hypopnea index, and mean sleep latency. In the auto-CPAP group, the pressure level could change within fixed limits in both directions (+2 to -4 cm H2O) of the previously determined effective pressure level (Peff). In the constant-CPAP group, patients used the same apparatus (Morphée Plus) in a constant mode at Peff level. At the beginning of the study, the Peff level was determined during a polysomnographic recording. Day-time vigilance was measured subjectively by a standardized questionnaire and objectively by the maintenance of wakefulness test (MWT); Trailmaking tests (TMT) were used to evaluate cognitive functions. After 3 wk of home CPAP therapy, a control sleep study was done with the CPAP machine used in the protocol, and daytime vigilance and cognitive function tests were obtained. Baseline sleep and nocturnal breathing disorders characteristics did not differ between the two groups, and daytime vigilance and cognitive function abnormalities were similarily altered. In both groups, the apnea/hypopnea index was within normal range at the final CPAP sleep study. In the auto-CPAP group, 49.3 +/- 14.9% (mean +/- SD) of home treatment time was spent at a pressure < or = Peff. Home amount of use estimated by the number of sleeping hours with a positive pressure applied was 6.5 +/- 1.0 h in the auto-CPAP group and 5.1 +/- 1.1 h in the constant-CPAP group (p = 0.02). During the control CPAP sleep study, the positive pressure level was significantly lower during Stage III-IV than during the other sleep stages (p = 0.004). The improvement in the MWT and the TMT observed with CPAP therapy was identical in both groups. We conclude that (1) the amount of use during CPAP treatment is higher with auto-CPAP than with constant-CPAP, and (2) Morphée+auto-CPAP is an efficient as conventional CPAP in correcting nocturnal breathing disorders, daytime sleepiness, and cognitive impairment in SAHS."

However, SDB remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. One of the major barriers identified by cardiologists is lack of satisfaction with SDB therapy. This situation could be the result of the discordance between treatment and the pathophysiological characteristics of SDB. This condition is caused by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, which could be classified into upper airway anatomic compromise, pharyngeal dilator muscle dysfunction, and ventilatory control instability. However, the effective treatment of SDB remains limited, and positive airway pressure therapy is still the mainstay of the treatment. Therefore, we review the pathophysiological characteristics of SDB in this article, and we propose to provide individualized treatment of SDB based on the underlying mechanism. This approach requires further study but could potentially improve adherence and success of therapy."

Patient/partner couples from the top (CPAP treated, n=44) or bottom (conservatively treated, n=25) of a CPAP waiting list rated marital satisfaction (evaluation and nurturing relationship issues, communication and happiness (ENRICH), behavioural questionnaire), health/functional status (Short-Form-36 Health Survey, functional outcomes of sleep questionnaire) and sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale). Both groups' ratings at baseline were completed while on conservative therapy. Baseline variables did not differ between groups. At follow-up, all seven summary psychosocial scores were statistically better in CPAP-treated patients, effect sizes (ES) ranging from moderate (0.5 SD: marital satisfaction) to very large (>1.0 SD: patients health, functional status and sleepiness scores). Scores in conservatively-treated patients deteriorated to a small or moderate degree (ES -0.2- -0.7 SD), while those in the CPAP-treated group improved to a larger degree (0.3-1.3 SD). Baseline polysomnographical and psychosocial scores, including marital satisfaction, did not predict objective CPAP use (r<0.3).

We postulated that providing intensive educational programs and nursing support to SAHS patients might improve CPAP use and outcomes. We also examined the hypothesis that CPAP use would be greater among patients who had initiated their own referral than among those asked to seek help by a partner. We randomized 80 consecutive, new patients with SAHS to receive either usual support or additional nursing input including CPAP education at home and involving their partners, a 3-night trial of CPAP in our institution's sleep center, and additional home visits once they had begun CPAP. The primary outcome variable was objective CPAP use; symptoms, mood, and cognitive function were also assessed after 6 mo. CPAP use over 6 mo was greater (p = 0.003) among patients receiving intensive than among those receiving standard support (5.4 +/- 0.3 versus 3.9 +/- 0. 4 h/night [mean +/- SEM]), with greater improvements (p < 0.05) in SAHS symptoms, mood, and reaction time in the intensively supported group. CPAP use was greater (p = 0.002) among patients who initiated their own referrals. CPAP use and outcomes of therapy can be improved by provision of a nurse-led intensive CPAP education and support program.

The aims of this study were to determine to what extent OSAHS patients have more difficulty with a monotonous simulated driving test when compared with control subjects and to compare the effects of OA with CPAP therapy. Simulated driving performance was evaluated in 20 OSAHS patients and 16 control subjects during a 25-min driving test. After randomization, ten patients started OA and CPAP therapy, respectively. After 2 to 3 months of treatment, patients repeated the driving test. At baseline, the total number of lapses of attention during driving was significantly higher in OSAHS patients as compared with control subjects. As a result of treatment, the total number of lapses of attention was significantly decreased in both the OA and CPAP group. When comparing driving performance between the OA and CPAP group, no significant differences were noted. OSAHS patients perform worse on a simulated driving test when compared with control subjects.

Diaphragm (EMGdi) and scalene (EMGsc) electromyographic activity were monitored with surface electrodes and abdominal EMG activity (EMGab) with wire electrodes. Subjects were studied in the following conditions: 1) awake, 2) stage 2 sleep, 3) stage 3/4 sleep, 4) CPAP during stage 3/4 sleep, 5) CPAP plus end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2) isocapnic to stage 2 sleep, and 6) CPAP plus PETCO2 isocapnic to stage 3/4 sleep. Inspired pulmonary resistance (RL) at peak flow rate and PETCO2 increased in all stages of sleep. Activity of EMGdi, EMGsc, and EMGab increased significantly in stage 3/4 sleep. CPAP reduced RL at peak flow, increased tidal volume and expired ventilation, and reduced PETCO2. EMGdi and EMGsc were reduced, and EMGab was silenced. During CPAP, with CO2 added to make PETCO2 isocapnic to stage 3/4 sleep, EMGsc and EMGab increased, but EMGdi was augmented in only one-half of the trials. EMG activity in this condition, however, was only 75% (EMGsc) and 43% (EMGab) of the activity observed during eupneic breathing in stage 3/4 sleep when PETCO2 was equal but RL was much higher. We conclude that during NREM sleep 1) inspiratory and expiratory muscles respond to internal inspiratory resistive loads and the associated dynamic airway narrowing and turbulent flow developed throughout inspiration, 2) some of the augmentation of respiratory muscle activity is also due to the hypercapnia that accompanies loading, and 3) the abdominal muscles are the most sensitive to load and CO2 and the diaphragm is the least sensitive."

Passive pharyngeal anatomy/collapsibility was quantified as the ventilation at CPAP = 0 cmH2O immediately after the CPAP drop. LG was defined as the ratio of the ventilatory overshoot to the preceding reduction in ventilation. UAG was taken as the ratio of the increase in ventilation to the increase in ventilatory drive across the pressure drop. Arousal threshold was estimated as the ventilatory drive that caused arousal. Veupnea was quantified as the mean ventilation prior to the pressure drop. In comparison with younger patients with OSA, older patients had a more collapsible airway (ventilation at 0 cmH2O = 3.4 ± 0.9 versus 1.5 ± 0.7 L/min; P = 0.05) but lower Veupnea (8.2 ± 0.5 versus 6.1 ± 0.4 L/min; P < 0.01) and a lower LG (5.0 ± 0.7 versus 2.9 ± 0.5; P < 0.05).

Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with endothelial and microcirculatory dysfunction and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Little is known about myocardial responses to apnea in patients with OSAS. We hypothesized that the coronary vascular response to hyperventilation and long breath-hold is diminished in patients with OSAS when compared to healthy volunteers.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-nine OSAS patients and 36 healthy volunteers were prospectively enrolled.

Rhythm disturbances are common in OSAS and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) has been shown to be beneficial. We present a case of a patient with obesity, atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular response, significant nocturnal pauses (3.9 s) and tachycardiomyopathy. A polysomnography confirmed severe OSAS (AHI=64.25). CPAP improved bradycardia and allowed for the introduction of β-blockers. Subsequent Holter monitoring revealed better rate control with the longest pause of 2 s and the patient's left ventricular systolic function improved. CPAP prevented our patient from invasive treatment, allowed for rate control and improvement of tachycardiomyopathy.

Twenty-four patients (20 males and four females) with mild to moderate OSA (AHI between 10 and 49 events per hour) were enrolled in the study. Each patient used both MAS and nCPAP, with the initial therapy being allocated at random. Treatment periods lasted for two months with a two-week wash-out interval between. Polysomnography was performed prior to the study and after each clinical intervention. Patient and partner questionnaires were used to assess changes in general health and daytime somnolence. The AHI decreased from 22.2 to 3.1 using nCPAP, and to 8.0 using the MAS (P < 0.001 for both devices) and there was no statistically significant difference between the two treatments. The Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) fell from 13.4 to 8.1 with nCPAP, and to 9.2 with MAS (P < 0.001), again with no differences between the use of MAS or nCPAP. The questionnaire data showed an improvement in general health scores (P < 0.001) after both treatments, but daytime sleepiness only improved significantly using nCPAP (P < 0.001). Despite this, 17 out of the 21 subjects who completed both arms of the study preferred the MAS. The splints were well tolerated and their efficacy suggests that the MAS may be a suitable alternative to nCPAP in the management of patients with mild or moderate OSA."

We hypothesized that PB will develop when PSV level exceeds the product of spontaneous tidal volume (VT) and elastance (VTsp . E) but that the actual level at which PB will develop [PSV(PB)] will be influenced by the DeltaPCO2 (difference between eupneic PCO2 and CO2 apneic threshold) and by DeltaRR [response of respiratory rate (RR) to PSV]. We also wished to determine the PAV level at which PB develops to assess inherent ventilatory stability in normal subjects. Twelve normal subjects underwent polysomnography while connected to a PSV/PAV ventilator prototype. Level of assist with either mode was increased in small steps (2-5 min each) until PB developed or the subject awakened. End-tidal PCO2, VT, RR, and airway pressure (Paw) were continuously monitored, and the pressure generated by respiratory muscle (Pmus) was calculated. The pressure amplification factor (PAF) at the highest PAV level was calculated from [(DeltaPaw + Pmus)/Pmus], where DeltaPaw is peak Paw - continuous positive airway pressure. PB with central apneas developed in 11 of 12 subjects on PSV. DeltaPCO2 ranged from 1.5 to 5.8 Torr. Changes in RR with PSV were small and bidirectional (+1.1 to -3.5 min-1). With use of stepwise regression, PSV(PB) was significantly correlated with VTsp (P = 0.001), E (P = 0.00009), DeltaPCO2 (P = 0.007), and DeltaRR (P = 0.006). The final regression model was as follows: PSV(PB) = 11.1 VTsp + 0.3E - 0.4 DeltaPCO2 - 0.34 DeltaRR - 3.4 (r = 0.98). PB developed in five subjects on PAV at amplification factors of 1.5-3.4. It failed to occur in seven subjects, despite PAF of up to 7.6. We conclude that 1) a PCO2 apneic threshold exists during sleep at 1.5-5.8 Torr below eupneic PCO2, 2) the development of PB during PSV is entirely predictable during sleep, and 3) the inherent susceptibility to PB varies considerably among normal subjects."

            "abstract": "Cough and sleep are vital functions. The effects of cough on sleep and vice versa are important for a number of reasons. Sleep disruption is common in patients with cough and is often the reason why they seek medical attention. Sleep suppresses cough and the biological mechanisms for this action are poorly understood. Cough has recently been reported as a presenting symptom of obstructive sleep apnea. It is uncommon for healthy people to cough at night; however, approximately 50% of patients with chronic cough report sleep disruption due to cough. Cough frequency is much lower at night than during the day. There is reduced exposure to tussive stimuli at night and decreased cough reflex sensitivity. Cough is more difficult to induce in REM sleep compared to slow-wave sleep. Studies of anesthetized humans have shown that the cough reflex is suppressed; however, the expiratory reflex is less affected. The sleep-cough interaction has implications for the physician. The measurement of cough frequency with 24-h ambulatory cough monitors in patients with chronic cough suggests that the presence or absence of nocturnal cough is not helpful in establishing the etiology. Nocturnal cough may be a useful outcome parameter for clinical trials of antitussive drugs since it is under less voluntary control than daytime cough. Most antitussive drugs are sedatives. This suggests that part or all of their action may be through an effect on cortical neural pathways. Unexplained chronic cough has recently been reported as a presenting feature of obstructive sleep apnea. Patients are likely to be female and report gastroesophageal reflux and rhinitis. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is effective in alleviating cough. Greater awareness of this condition is needed."

The syndrome is linked with loud snoring, disrupted sleep and observed apnoeas. Serious co-morbidities associated with OSA appear to be reversed by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment; however, CPAP is variably tolerated leaving many patients untreated and emphasising the need for alternative treatments. Virtually all OSA patients have airways that are anatomically vulnerable to collapse, but numerous pathophysiological factors underlie when and how OSA is manifested. This review describes how the complexity of OSA requires multiple treatment approaches that are individually targeted. This approach may take the form of more specific diagnoses in terms of the mechanisms underlying OSA as well as rational pharmacological treatment directed toward such disparate ends as arousal threshold and ventilatory control/chemosensitivity, and mechanical treatment in the form of surgery and augmentation of lung volumes."

            "abstract": "Midlatency respiratory-related evoked potentials were measured during wakefulness by using a 60-electrode array placed over the cortical region of the scalp. We studied the responses evoked by 200-ms pressure pulses at -5 and -10 cmH(2)O applied at inspiratory onset and during control tests (no pressure applied) in 14 subjects with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and 18 normal subjects. Wavelet decomposition was used to smooth and dissect the respiratory-related evoked potentials in frequency and time in 8 frequency bands. After denoising, selected wavelet scales were used to reconstruct the respiratory-related evoked potentials, which were quantified by using global field power estimates. The time course of the global field power activity in OSAS subjects compared with normal subjects was significantly depressed in the period 55-70 ms poststimulus onset, a time when afferent traffic from upper airway receptors arrives in normal subjects. The reduced evoked response in subjects with OSAS suggests that these subjects receive less afferent input from upper airway mechanoreceptors. This may reflect reduced sensitivity of mechanoreceptors or reduced mechanoreceptor stimulation due to decreased upper airway compliance during wakefulness in OSAS."

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder in which repetitive apnoeas expose the cardiovascular system to cycles of hypoxia, exaggerated negative intrathoracic pressure, and arousals. These noxious stimuli can, in turn, depress myocardial contractility, activate the sympathetic nervous system, raise blood pressure, heart rate, and myocardial wall stress, depress parasympathetic activity, provoke oxidative stress and systemic inflammation, activate platelets, and impair vascular endothelial function. Epidemiological studies have shown significant independent associations between OSA and hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, and stroke. In randomised trials, treating OSA with continuous positive airway pressure lowered blood pressure, attenuated signs of early atherosclerosis, and, in patients with heart failure, improved cardiac function. Current data therefore suggest that OSA increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, and that its treatment has the potential to diminish such risk. However, large-scale randomised trials are needed to determine, definitively, whether treating OSA improves cardiovascular outcomes."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) during sleep in a group of obese patients and in another group with restrictive thoracic diseases (RTD), comparing the results with those obtained from conventional nocturnal oxygen therapy. From a total of 42 patients with CWD free of daytime respiratory failure, 27 (64%) were considered nocturnal oxygen desaturators without sleep apnea and were included in the study. The study protocol was completed by 21 of these patients. After 2 weeks of treatment, symptoms of dyspnea, morning headaches, and morning obnubilation improved significantly (p<0.05) in both groups of patients after NIPPV but not with oxygen. Baseline daytime PaO2 was 68+/-7 mm Hg in the obese group of patients and 73+/-11 mm Hg in the RTD group. It improved significantly with NIPPV to 73+/-5 mm Hg in obese patients (p<0.05) and to 77+/-12 mm Hg in the RTD group (p<0.05) but did not change with oxygen (68+/-8 mm Hg in the obese group and 73+/-12 mm Hg in the RTD group). Both treatments improved oxygen saturation during sleep, but oxygenation tends to be higher with oxygen than with NIPPV. Only NIPPV was able to normalize the baseline nocturnal alveolar hypoventilation. From the 21 patients treated, 19 decided to continue with long-term NIPPV, one with oxygen, and one refused treatment. We conclude that in patients with CWD who manifest nighttime oxygen desaturation and hypoventilation, early initiation of NIPPV is preferable to supplemental oxygen.

Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that PAP can effectively reduce the apnea-hypopnea index and improve subjective and objective sleepiness. Some studies have also demonstrated benefits in sleep quality and quality of life for both the patient and bed partner. Observational studies have shown a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events in OSA patients treated with PAP compared to untreated patients. Since continuous PAP (CPAP) treatment of OSA was described, additional modes of pressure delivery have been developed (bilevel PAP, autoadjusting PAP, flexible PAP). While none of the variants of PAP improves adherence in unselected patients compared to CPAP, individual patients may respond to a change in pressure mode. Attended PAP titration remains the standard of practice for selecting a treatment pressure. However, use of autotitrating PAP devices in the unattended setting can provide an effective titration alternative with careful patient selection and review of titration results. More choices of mask interface are now available to improve comfort and intervene for mask or mouth leaks. However, despite the increase in PAP treatment options, lack of acceptance and inadequate adherence to PAP therapy remain the major causes of treatment failure. Some studies suggest that heated humidification can improve PAP adherence, especially in patients with nasal congestion or dryness. A systematic approach to PAP treatment including education, objective adherence monitoring, early intervention for side effects, and telephone and clinic support is essential to optimize adherence."

The participants were 46 consecutive patients with ADHF who had OSA (apnea-hypopnea index [AHI], >or= 15 events per hour). Participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention arm (n = 23), with in-hospital treatment of OSA using auto-adjusting positive airway pressure along with standard treatment of ADHF, or to the control arm (n = 23), in which they received only standard treatment for ADHF. The primary outcome was the change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 3 nights postrandomization.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The change in LVEF from baseline to 3 days postrandomization in the intervention arm was significantly superior to that of the control group. The difference in LVEF improvement was 4.6% (p = 0.03). LVEF increased in the intervention group by 4.5% (SE, 1.7%). The LVEF change in the control arm was--0.3% (SE, 1.5%). The difference in LVEF improvement between the two groups persisted after adjustment for baseline LVEF, type of cardiomyopathy, BMI, AHI, and sex.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      An approach of early identification and in-hospital treatment of OSA in patients with ADHF is feasible and resulted in improvement in systolic function.

Adaptive servo-ventilation is a therapy that uses a noninvasive ventilator to treat central sleep apnea by delivering servo-controlled inspiratory pressure support on top of expiratory positive airway pressure.

Clinical evaluation followed by diagnostic overnight polysomnogram was performed in subjects on chronic opioid therapy who met the study criteria. All subjects had an initial CPAP titration followed by a repeat clinical evaluation. Subjects with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5 continued to report symptoms and had follow-up titration with bilevel positive therapy; then bilevel positive-pressure therapy with a back-up rate was then performed.

As all of these stimuli might be active under the conditions of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), we hypothesized that vascular AM production is increased in these patients. The study included 41 consecutive OSA patients and 28 control subjects without sleep-disordered breathing who were recruited from a pool of patients hospitalized for other reasons. Both groups were matched for anthropometric and comorbid factors. In all patients, i.e. OSA and controls, peripheral venous blood samples were taken at 07:00 hours after diagnostic polysomnography. In subsets of OSA patients, this was repeated after two nights of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy (n = 28) and after several months of constant CPAP use (n = 11). The controls and the untreated OSA patients did not have serial blood sampling. In all blood samples, plasma AM levels were measured by an enzyme immunoassay kit. At baseline, the OSA patients had markedly elevated AM concentrations when compared to the controls. There were no differences between normo- and hypertensive OSA patients. After two nights of CPAP therapy, AM levels significantly decreased. Patients on long-term CPAP treatment showed complete normalization of plasma AM concentrations. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests that circulating AM is increased in untreated OSA irrespective of coexistent arterial hypertension and declines after CPAP therapy. AM upregulation might be considered as an adaptive mechanism to counteract the emergence of OSA-related cardiovascular disease."

The aims of the present study were to examine serum levels of sTNFR-1 and the effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in patients with OSA. A prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed. In total, 30 consecutive newly diagnosed OSA patients (apnoea/hypopnoea index 43.8+/-27.0 events x h(-1)) and 15 healthy obese patients were selected. Urinary levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, as well as plasma sTNFR-1, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and leukotriene (LT)B(4) levels were obtained at baseline and after 3 months of CPAP or sham CPAP. Nocturnal urinary levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine and sTNFR-1 (1,053+/-269 versus 820+/-166 pg x mL(-1)) were significantly higher in OSA patients. There were no significant differences in plasma levels of IL-6, LTB(4), or TNF-alpha between the two study groups. There were no significant differences in blood pressure, urinary catecholamine levels, or plasma IL-6, LTB(4) and TNF-alpha levels after both treatment modalities. However, after 3 months of effective CPAP usage, sTNFR-1 levels were significantly reduced (1,053+/-269 versus 899+/-254 pg x mL(-1)). Obstructive sleep apnoea patients have higher levels of soluble tumour necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1 than individuals without OSA; soluble tumour necrosis factor-alpha receptor 1 levels are lowered by continuous positive airway pressure therapy. These findings further corroborate a potential role of inflammation in the natural history of obstructive sleep apnoea."

It is associated with a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

We measured upper airway closing pressures (UACP) during sleep in 12 patients with Marfan's syndrome and 6 age-, and height-, and weight-matched control subjects. Ten of the patients had OSA, defined as an apnea/hypopnea index > 5. All patients with Marfan's syndrome, including the two patients without OSA, demonstrated increased upper airway collapsibility during sleep, with a mean UACP of -2.5 +/- 0.5 cm H2O during slow-wave sleep (SWS). In contrast, only two control subjects demonstrated upper airway closure. However, this was at significantly higher suction pressures, with a mean UACP of -5.6 +/- 0.4 cm H2O during SWS (p < 0.005). These data suggest that patients with Marfan's syndrome have abnormally increased upper airway collapsibility during sleep.

Fifty-one consecutive males with OSAS and 29 age-matched healthy men underwent the Valsalva test and standard polysomnography. Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of >or=20 episodes per hour were randomized to receive CPAP treatment for 3 months (n=14) or no such treatment (n=19). The BRS index measured from the overshoot phase (phase IV) of the Valsalva maneuver and plasma NO concentration were significantly lower, whereas the AHI, oxygen desaturation time, arousal index, percentage of sleep stage 1, and systolic blood pressure were significantly greater, in patients with an AHI of >or=20/h than in those with an AHI of <20/h or in controls. The 24-h urinary excretion of norepinephrine was significantly reduced and the plasma NO concentration was significantly increased after one night of CPAP. The BRS index for phase IV and the Valsalva ratio were significantly increased in the CPAP group after the 3-month treatment period but remained unchanged in the non-CPAP group of OSAS patients. The daytime BRS index and NO production were thus inversely related to the severity of OSAS, and successful CPAP treatment improved these parameters in patients with moderate to severe OSAS. CPAP may therefore reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications due to endothelial dysfunction or increased sympathetic activity."

This means that after the therapy there was a marked tendency to longer latencies at all 4 points of measurement with significant differences at 12.00 and 14.00 hrs. A comparison of the quality of sleep before and after the therapy yielded an increase in deep sleep and a significant increase in REM density during dream sleep. MSLT enabled objectivation of improved sleep quality and of subjective decrease in day tiredness after CPAP therapy in patients with obstructive snoring.

            "abstract": "Recent objective studies demonstrate relatively low hours of nightly use during nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients frequently complain of dyspnea or discomfort during CPAP use, especially during expiration (against the continuous pressure), which may be a reason for the low hours of use. We hypothesized that with decreased expiratory pressure, hours of nightly use would increase. Therefore, we randomized 83 OSA patients to receive either continuous or bilevel positive airway pressure when expiratory pressure is lower. To document objectively the effective use of either therapy, we built and installed elapsed-time and mask pressure sensors in the patients' positive airway pressure units. A total of 62 patients were evaluable and followed for 1 yr. Of these, 26 received bilevel and 36 CPAP pressures. The machine timers measured accumulated \"machine-on\" time, and the mask pressure sensor recorded the total time in which the mask pressure was within 2 cm H2O of the effective pressure (pressure shown to eliminate 95% of the obstructive apneas during a full night of polysomnography). The mean machine timer hours of CPAP were 5.0 +/- 0.19 SEM and 4.9 +/- 0.23 SEM during bilevel therapy (p NS) over a 12-mo period. The pressures required during CPAP or bilevel therapy were not different between high and low hourly users. Effective use, the percentage of time that the machine was running and the prescribed pressure was being delivered, was 80% in CPAP and 82% in the bilevel users (p NS). Both groups had equal complaints with regard to mask discomfort, machine noise, and nasal stuffiness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder, which is, among others, associated with snoring. OSA has a considerable impact on a patient's general health and daily life. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) is frequently used as a \"gold standard\" treatment for OSA. As an alternative, especially for mild/moderate cases, mandibular advancement devices (MADs) are prescribed increasingly. Their efficacy and effectiveness seem to be acceptable. Although some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been published recently, most studies so far are case studies. Therefore, our department is planning a controlled RCT, in which MADs are compared with both nCPAP and a control condition in a parallel design. As a first step, an adjustable MAD was developed with a small, more or less constant vertical dimension at different mandibular positions. To test the device and the experimental procedures, a pilot trial was performed with 10 OSA patients (six mild, four moderate; one women, nine men; mean age = 47.9 +/- 9.7 years). They all underwent a polysomnographic recording before as well as 2-14 weeks after insertion of the MAD (adjusted at 50% of the maximal protrusion). The apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was significantly reduced with the MAD in situ (P = 0.017). When analysed as separate groups, the moderate cases showed a significantly larger decrease in AHI than the mild cases (P = 0.012). It was therefore concluded from this pilot study that this MAD might be an effective tool in the treatment of, especially, moderate OSA."

This randomised trial provides some evidence that C-Flex might increase initial treatment compliance, compared to CPAP, in patients with severe OSA. However, this trend toward greater compliance was not associated with better short-term treatment outcomes for patients. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger, longer-term trial."

The hypothesis is that patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) who exhibit a majority of mixed apneas will differ in ventilatory control from those with predominantly obstructive apneas during wakefulness; moreover, this difference could affect nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) adherence.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In a retrospectively derived case-control study, 5 min of respiratory inductance plethysmography signals during wakefulness prior to sleep onset were extracted from a diagnostic polysomnogram in these groups: (1) mixed apnea-dominant OSAS (mix-OSAS) (n = 36), (2) obstructive apnea-dominant OSAS (pure-OSAS) (n = 20), (3) central apnea-dominant sleep apnea syndrome (pure-CSAS) (n = 6), and (4) control subjects (n = 10). Breathing patterning was compared between the groups using the coefficient of variation (CV) for breath-to-breath inspiration time (TI), expiration time (TE), TI + TE (Ttot), and tidal volume, and an information theory-based metric of signal pattern variability (sample entropy).

No studies prospectively evaluated screening tools to report calibration or clinical utility for improving health outcomes. Meta-analysis found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) compared with sham was significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), excessive sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 trials, 2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% CI, -3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 participants). CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life (Cohen d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 participants). Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs were also associated with reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness.

In cohort studies, there was a consistent association between AHI and all-cause mortality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools.

With the notion that CSA will be eliminated with continued use of CPAP, 4 weeks later, 9 of the 16 patients underwent a second CPAP titration which proved equally ineffective. Therefore, therapy with CPAP was abandoned. All patients underwent ASV titration.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Diagnostic polysomnography showed an average apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 61/h and a central-apnea index (CAI) of 32/h.

With a reduction in AHI, oxyhemoglobin saturation nadir increased from 83% to 90%, and arousal index decreased from 29/h of sleep to 12/h on final ASV pressures.

Compared to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), NPPV was superior in correcting blood gas abnormalities both during the night-time and during the daytime in a subgroup of patients with the obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). However, as it is unknown, if and to what extent NPPV can unload the respiratory muscles in the face of the increased impedance of the respiratory system in obesity, this is what was investigated. Eighteen obese subjects with a body mass index > or = 40 kg x m(-2) were investigated during the daytime, which included five healthy controls (simple obesity (SO)), seven patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) and six patients with the obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS). Assisted PPV was performed with bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), applied via a face mask. Inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) was set to 1.2 or 1.6 kPa and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) was set to 0.5 kPa. Inspiratory muscle activity was measured as diaphragmatic pressure time product (PTPdi). Comparison of spontaneous breathing with BiPAP ventilation showed no significant difference in breathing pattern, although there was a tendency towards an increase in tidal volume (VT) in all three groups and a decrease in respiratory frequency (fR) in patients with OSA and OHS. End-tidal carbon dioxide (PET,CO2) with BiPAP was unchanged in SO and OSA, but was decreased in OHS. In contrast, inspiratory muscle activity was reduced by at least 40% in each group. This was indicated by a decrease in PTPdi with BiPAP 1.2/0.5 kPa from mean+/-SD 39+/-5 to 20+/-9 kPa x s (p<0.05) in SO, from 42+/-7 to 21+/-8 kPa x s (p<0.05) in OSA, and from 64+/-20 to 38+/-17 kPa x s (p<0.05) in OHS. With BiPAP 1.6/0.5 kPa, PTPdi was further reduced to 17+/-6 kPa x s in SO, and to 17+/-6 kPa x s in OSA, but not in OHS (40+/-22 kPa x s).

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea (OSAH) causes excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), impairs quality of life (QoL) and increases cardiovascular disease and road traffic accident risks. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment is clinically effective but undermined by intolerance, and its cost-effectiveness is borderline in milder cases. Mandibular advancement devices (MADs) are another option, but evidence is lacking regarding their clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in milder disease.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      (1) Conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) examining the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MADs against no treatment in mild to moderate OSAH. (2) Update systematic reviews and an existing health economic decision model with data from the Trial of Oral Mandibular Advancement Devices for Obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea (TOMADO) and newly published results to better inform long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of MADs and CPAP in mild to moderate OSAH.\n    \n\n\n          Tomado:\n        \n      \n      A crossover RCT comparing clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three MADs: self-moulded [SleepPro 1™ (SP1); Meditas Ltd, Winchester, UK]; semibespoke [SleepPro 2™ (SP2); Meditas Ltd, Winchester, UK]; and fully bespoke [bespoke MAD (bMAD); NHS Oral-Maxillofacial Laboratory, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK] against no treatment, in 90 adults with mild to moderate OSAH. All devices improved primary outcome [apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI)] compared with no treatment: relative risk 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.89] for SP1; relative risk 0.67 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.76) for SP2; and relative risk 0.64 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.76) for bMAD (p < 0.001). Differences between MADs were not significant. Sleepiness [as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)] was scored 1.51 [95% CI 0.73 to 2.29 (SP1)] to 2.37 [95% CI 1.53 to 3.22 (bMAD)] lower than no treatment (p < 0.001), with SP2 and bMAD significantly better than SP1. All MADs improved disease-specific QoL. Compliance was lower for SP1, which was unpopular at trial exit. At 4 weeks, all devices were cost-effective at £20,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with SP2 the best value below £39,800/QALY.\n    \n\n\n          Meta-analysis:\n        \n      \n      A MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index search updating two existing systematic reviews (one from November 2006 and the other from June 2008) to August 2013 identified 77 RCTs in adult OSAH patients comparing MAD with conservative management (CM), MADs with CPAP or CPAP with CM. MADs and CPAP significantly improved AHI [MAD -9.3/hour (p < 0.001); CPAP -25.4/hour (p < 0.001)]. Effect difference between CPAP and MADs was 7.0/hour (p < 0.001), favouring CPAP. No trials compared CPAP with MADs in mild OSAH. MAD and CPAP reduced the ESS score similarly [MAD 1.6 (p < 0.001); CPAP 1.6 (p < 0.001)].\n    \n\n\n          Long-term cost-effectiveness:\n        \n      \n      An existing model assessed lifetime cost-utility of MAD and CPAP in mild to moderate OSAH, using the revised meta-analysis to update input values. The TOMADO provided utility estimates, mapping ESS score to European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions three-level version for device cost-utility. Using SP2 as the standard device, MADs produced higher mean costs and mean QALYs than CM [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) £6687/QALY]. From a willingness to pay (WTP) of £15,367/QALY, CPAP is cost-effective, although the likelihood of MADs (p = 0.48) and CPAP (p = 0.49) being cost-effective is very similar. Both were better than CM, but there was much uncertainty in the choice between CPAP and MAD (at a WTP £20,000/QALY, the probability of being the most cost-effective was 47% for MAD and 52% for CPAP). When SP2 lifespan increased to 18 months, the ICER for CPAP compared with MAD became £44,066. The ICER for SP1 compared with CM was £1552, and for bMAD compared with CM the ICER was £13,836. The ICER for CPAP compared with SP1 was £89,182, but CPAP produced lower mean costs and higher mean QALYs than bMAD. Differential compliance rates for CPAP reduces cost-effectiveness so MADs become less costly and more clinically effective with CPAP compliance 90% of SP2.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Mandibular advancement devices are clinically effective and cost-effective in mild to moderate OSAH. A semi-bespoke MAD is the appropriate first choice in most patients in the short term. Future work should explore whether or not adjustable MADs give additional clinical and cost benefits. Further data on longer-term cardiovascular risk and its risk factors would reduce uncertainty in the health economic model and improve precision of effectiveness estimates.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      This trial is registered as ISRCTN02309506.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 18, No. 67.

            "abstract": "The effect of ethanol ingestion on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) as a treatment for the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome was studied in ten obese male subjects undergoing this therapy. On the first night of polysomnography, the lowest level of CPAP that maintained airway patency was determined (critical level). On the second (control) night (C), subjects slept the entire night on this level of CPAP. On the third night (E), subjects ingested either 1.5 ml/kg (part A, N = 6) or 2.0 ml/kg (part B, N = 4) of 50 percent ethanol (100 proof vodka) over one half-hour starting 1 h before bedtime. A serum ethanol level was obtained at bedtime (part A: 63.7 +/- 17.3 mg/dl; part B: 108.6 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and subjects were monitored on the critical level of CPAP. Comparison of nights C and E for parts A + B showed no difference in total sleep time (TST) or the amount of different sleep stages as an absolute time or a percentage of TST except that there was more stage 2 (as a percent of TST) on E nights. The apnea + hypopnea index and C and E nights did not differ and was quite low (3.6 +/- 3.7/h vs 1.9 +/- 2.7/h). Similarly, ethanol ingestion did not increase the number of desaturations to at or below 90 and 85 percent, or lower the mean arterial oxygen saturation in NREM or REM sleep. Analysis of parts A and B separately also showed no differences with respect to the apnea + hypopnea index or the number of desaturations on control and ethanol nights. We conclude that acute moderate ethanol ingestion does not decrease the efficacy of an optimum level of nasal CPAP."

Evidence linked OSA to cardiovascular disease, and the role of OSA in abnormal Blood Pressure (BP) control has been extensively studied. Although longitudinal trials suggest a causative role of OSA in the development of hypertension, the evidence is not fully consistent. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) applied during sleep is well documented and a highly efficient therapeutic aid to eliminate OSA. It has been repeatedly shown that nCPAP-therapy is also associated with modest BP lowering effect in hypertensive OSA-patients, and the magnitude of the observed effect correlates with the severity of OSA. However, it is unlikely that nCPAP would normalize BP.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      There are few studies which tested the interplay between OSA, nCPAP and certain BPlowering drug classes. Angiotensin receptor blockers may show synergistic hypotensive effect with nCPAP, whereas mineralocorticoid receptor blocker has been shown to modestly attenuate the severity of OSA. Additionally, the application of chronotherapy may be of special use in such patients. The current evidence is sufficient to promote persistent and effective nCPAP-therapy as a standard in all eligible OSA-patients with difficult-to-control hypertension."

The association of sleep disorders and stroke is exciting. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is now considered a systemic disease significantly increases the risk of stroke and death from any cause and the increase is independent of other risk factors including hypertension. There is high prevalence of OSA in the elderly. OSA affects the cerebral hemodynamics adversely. There appears to be a bi-directional relation between sleep disordered breathing(SDB) and cerebrovascular accidents. Strokes can themselves generate SDB. The presence of OSA in stroke patients is associated with poor outcome. Cyclical hypoxia and sympathetic stimulation has deleterious effects on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic functions. The effects are particularly important in existing ischemic brain injury. Use of continuous positive pressure in OSA patients is rewarding. We propose that feeding through Ryle's tube may compromise with the patency of pharynx during sleep times and therefore this must be considered in management guidelines for stroke."

            "abstract": "Compelling data demonstrate a strong association between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and cardiovascular disorders. The association is most consistent between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension. Epidemiologic and clinic-based studies provide evidence for an etiological role of OSA in hypertension, independent of obesity. Furthermore, several studies suggest amelioration of hypertension with therapy for sleep apnea. Emerging data also suggest a role for OSA in causing coronary artery disease. This association is bolstered by evidence suggesting that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy improves early signs of atherosclerosis and may impede progression to clinically important cardiovascular disease. SDB (both OSA and central sleep apnea) is frequently observed in patients with heart failure. OSA may be a risk factor for incident heart failure. The current data do not provide consistent evidence for whether treatment of SDB will improve survival or other end points in patients with heart failure, and larger trials are currently underway to better elucidate that relationship. Substantial evidence also links SDB to an increased risk of various arrhythmias. Treatment of SDB with CPAP appears to significantly attenuate that risk. Finally, several studies suggest SDB as a risk factor for stroke. Whether treatment of SDB reduces stroke risk, however, remains to be determined. In conclusion, persuasive data provide evidence for an association, probably causal, between sleep-disordered breathing and several cardiovascular disorders. Large randomized controlled trials will further help confirm the association and elucidate the cardiovascular benefits of SDB therapy."

            "abstract": "Study objectives:\n        \n      \n      Autoadjustable continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices are increasingly used in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Since different measurements of upper airway obstruction are applied, it is uncertain whether these devices are equally effective in controlling sleep-disordered breathing. Hypothesizing that differences in therapeutic efficacy were to come out, we compared the performance of the AutoSet device (ResMed; Sydney, Australia), which features autoadjustable positive airway pressure (APAP) guided by detection of flow limitation (APAPfl), with the SOMNOsmart device (Weinmann; Hamburg, Germany), which features APAP guided by the forced oscillation technique (APAPfot).\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A double-blind, randomized, cross-over trial.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      The sleep disorders center and sleep laboratory of a university hospital.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and interventions:\n        \n      \n      An overnight CPAP autotitration procedure was performed in 30 patients with OSA.

No significant differences were found in conventional sleep variables. While the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was lower with APAPfl (3.5 +/- 5.6/h) as compared to APAPfot (9.9 +/- 31.0/h), the difference was not statistically significant (mean +/- SD). The snoring index, however, was significantly lower with APAPfl (35.3 +/- 53.7/h vs 111.6 +/- 175.4/h, respectively; p = 0.01). The median and 95th percentile pressure levels rose from wakefulness to sleep in APAPfl, but decreased in APAPfot. Higher pressure variability was present in the latter method.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that the APAPfl is superior to APAPfot in the control of snoring. While a lower AHI was achieved with APAPfl, at the expense of a higher median pressure but less pressure variability, the difference with APAPfot was not statistically significant."

We investigated the efficacy and compliance in continuous use at home. Fifty-two patients were treated (randomized crossover) with CPAP and APAP(FOT) for 6 wk each. Respiratory disturbances, sleep profile, and arousals improved significantly with both modes (AHI: baseline, 35.1 +/- 26/h; APAP(FOT), 5.0 +/- 5.2; CPAP, 4.3 +/- 6.3; p < 0.001 baseline versus each mode).

The Apnea /Hypopnea Index (AHI), Apnea Index (AI), Hypopnea Index (HI), average SpO2 were all derived from the data of sleeping monitoring. In group A, the AHI and AI decreased after CPAP treatment; in the same time, SpO2 increased; these changes were significant (P < 0.05). The HI showed no significant change after CPAP treatment. The AHI, AI and HI of group A after CPAP treatment were significantly lower than those of group B after altitude hypoxia treatment only, and the SpO2 of group A was higher than that of group B. The pharyngeal inspiration pressure of group A was significantly decreased after CPAP treatment and was significantly lower than that of group B. All in all, the findings suggested that CPAP treatment could normalize the physiological indices of sleeping."

Therefore, daytime trends of blood gases and breathing pattern were assessed by measurements 0, 0.5, 1, 3, 7, 11 and 15 h after cessation of nocturnal controlled NPPV in patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Twelve patients (six COPD/six restrictive) who were established on NPPV and 12 controls (six COPD/six restrictive) completed. PaCO2 decreased during controlled NPPV (P < 0.02). PaCO2 additionally decreased step by step during the first 3 h of spontaneous breathing after switching from NPPV to spontaneous breathing (P < 0.05), but remained unchanged in controls. The PaCO2 decrease was due to a stepwise increase in tidal volume (P < 0.05) at an unchanged breathing frequency. Accordingly, minute ventilation also stepwise increased (P < 0.03). There were no significant changes in controls. Improvements of PaCO2 and tidal volume occurred even after 5.7 +/- 3.1 days following first NPPV trials, but became more evident after 2 months. Maximal inspiratory mouth pressures increased in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients (P < 0.05), and respiratory drive increased in restrictive patients (P < 0.05) following 2 months of NPPV. Lung function parameters and inspiratory impedance remained unchanged. Improvements in health-related quality of life were evident and were correlated to the decline of elevated bicarbonate levels (r = 0.72, P < 0.01). In conclusion, there is a stepwise adaptation process lasting 3h when switching from nocturnal controlled NPPV to daytime spontaneous breathing in which tidal volume increases and PaCO2 drops after an initial PaCO2 decrease while on NPPV."

We studied 11 men with sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome and 11 normal men during non-rapid eye movement sleep. We measured EEG, electrooculogram, arterial O(2) saturation, and end-tidal P(CO2). To maintain upper airway patency in patients with sleep apnea, nasal continuous positive pressure was applied at a level sufficient to eliminate apneas and hypopneas. We compared the prehypoxic control (C) with posthypoxic recovery breaths. Nadir minute ventilation in normal subjects was 6.3 +/- 0.5 l/min (83.8 +/- 5.7% of room air control) vs. 6.7 +/- 0.9 l/min, 69.1 +/- 8.5% of room air control in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients; nadir minute ventilation (% of control) was lower in patients with OSA relative to normal subjects (P < 0.05).

The results of APAP treatment strongly depend on the control mechanism of the respective APAP device. In agreement with other working groups, we have recently shown that the forced oscillation technique (FOT) is capable of detecting incipient upper airway obstruction prior to physiological reactions such as the onset of increasing esophageal pressure swings or microarousals. Therefore we studied efficacy and acceptance of a novel APAP device controlled exclusively by FOT. 100 consecutive patients with OSAS confirmed by polysomnography (mean AHI 47.9 +/- 22.6) and daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale, ESS 12.6 +/- 3.9) were randomized to either APAP treatment (n = 50) or conventional CPAP treatment (n = 50). Polysomnographies were performed at the second treatment night and subjective sleepiness (modified ESS) was established in the morning. The respiratory disturbance was largely normalized in both treatment groups in the second treatment night (AHI 4.7 +/- 5.3 vs. 3.7 +/- 3.4; n.s.). Both groups showed largely improved sleep profiles and had markedly reduced ESS-scores (6.6 +/- 3.6 vs. 7.0 +/- 3.4; n.s.). The mean treatment pressure during APAP was significantly lower than during CPAP treatment (6.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 9.0 +/- 1.8 mbar; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between APAP and CPAP treatment in any parameter of efficacy or acceptance. APAP treatment with this device controlled exclusively by FOT is well accepted by the patients and permits an adequate treatment of OSAS without the need for invidiual CPAP titration."

The aims of this review are to investigate the contribution of psychological constructs and theory to the assessment and treatment of OSA. Adherence to CPAP treatment remains a primary concern for improving treatment outcomes for OSA. Modifiable, psychological constructs of self-efficacy, coping, social support, treatment satisfaction and self-reported daytime sleepiness improve the prediction of CPAP adherence. These predictors are particularly robust in the context of a theoretical model. Social Cognition Theory (SCT) and Health Belief Model (HBM) are emerging as promising psychological models for understanding patient acceptance and adherence to CPAP treatment. An overview of psychologically informed interventions for CPAP use is presented. Education-based interventions have promise, but the strongest and robust findings are emerging from theory-driven interventions. Specifically, Cognitive-Behaviourally informed interventions and Motivational Interventions demonstrate consistent and large effect sizes in improving CPAP adherence rates."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether a simplified diagnostic procedure based on ambulatory monitoring with MESAM IV altered subsequent compliance with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) patients. During a period of 16 months, 60 patients with symptoms evocative of OSA and positive MESAM recording were prescribed CPAP after titration with standard polysomnography. Compliance was followed during 2 yrs based on built-in time counters and was compared with the compliance in two comparison groups: an equal number of equally severely affected patients diagnosed with standard polysomnography during the 18 months (8 months before and 8 months after) preceding and following the study period and a group of 48 patients with an estimated similar apnoea/hypopnoea index but less typical clinical and/or MESAM features, diagnosed as having OSA based on polysomnography during the study period. The three groups were not different by age, body mass index, or sleepiness score. Patients diagnosed with the ambulatory procedure had higher drop-out rates (21.7% versus 10% and 6.25%; p<0.05) and lower rates of use of their CPAP (43+/-0.3 h x night(-1)) than any of the control groups (53+/-0.2 and 5.6+/-0.2 h x night(-1), p<0.05). In conclusion, there is a risk that ambulatory diagnostic procedures alter the relationship of patients to their disease and/or the medical staff so that subsequent compliance with treatment may be decreased. The greatest care concerning compliance should be taken before an ambulatory-based diagnostic procedure is implemented."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of tMRAs in the treatment of OSAS on the criteria of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM; apnea/hypopnea index [AHI] < 5). Three hundred consecutive patients with a polysomnographic diagnosis of OSAS were referred for treatment with tMRAs between 2000 and 2003. Thirty-eight patients were excluded, and 262 concluded the titration protocol with tMRA that lasted 4 months. After titration, the patients were referred for a medical reassessment, and 83 patients (70 men) participated in the new polysomnographic exam with tMRA in place to access tMRA's efficacy. The mean pre- and post-treatment AHI were 26 +/- 17.7 and 4.8 +/- 5.3 events per hour, respectively (p < 0.00005). Fifty-three (62.6%) of the 83 patients were treated successfully (AHI < 5). Twenty-three patients had severe OSAS, and 12 of them (52.1%) were treated successfully (AHI < 5). Forty patients had moderate OSAS, and 26 of them (65%) were treated successfully. Twenty patients had mild OSAS, and 15 (75%) were successfully treated. Even when applying more rigid criteria such as those of the AASM, the expressive success rate obtained with the treatment of different degrees of OSAS indicates that tMRAs are an additional valuable option even for cases of severe apnea in which the patient does not tolerate continuous positive airway pressure or cannot afford this treatment, a fact quite common in Brazil and other developing countries."

Women were studied in both the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. The amount by which PAV amplified LG was quantified from the tidal volume amplification factor [(VtAF) assisted tidal volume/unassisted tidal volume]. LG was calculated as the inverse of the VtAF occurring at the assist level immediately preceding the emergence of periodic breathing (when LG x VtAF = 1). Only 1 of 10 men and 2 of 9 women developed periodic breathing with PAV. The rest were resistant to periodic breathing despite moderately high levels of PAV amplification.

Moreover, we tested the hypothesis that nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) improves such alterations in OSAS patients by eliminating apneic events.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 27 consecutive newly diagnosed middle-aged OSAS men with neither controllable factors nor conditions affecting left ventricular diastolic function and 15 healthy control subjects were selected. OSAS patients were randomized to 12 weeks on sham nCPAP and 12 weeks on effective nCPAP application. Echocardiographic parameters, blood pressure recordings, and urinary catecholamine levels were obtained at baseline and after both treatment modalities. At baseline, an abnormal left ventricular filling pattern was present in 15 of the 27 OSAS patients and only in 3 of the 15 control subjects (P=0.020). Impaired relaxation was by far the most common abnormal pattern in both groups (11 and 3 patients, respectively). In OSAS patients, 12 weeks on effective nCPAP induced a significant increase in E/A ratio (P<0.01), as well as reductions in mitral deceleration (P<0.01) and isovolumic relaxation (P<0.05) times.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      OSAS can affect left ventricular diastolic function independently of other possible factors.

After excluding those with a history suggestive of obstructive sleep apnoea, 35 patients with CCF (left ventricular ejection fraction <35%) were screened with overnight oximetry and the diagnosis of CSAS was established with polysomnography in 18. Two 14-day cycles of CPAP (0.85 kPa (8.5 mbar)) or bilevel ventilation (0.85/0.3 kPa (8.5/3 mbar)) in random order, were compared in a crossover study. Sixteen patients (13 males), mean age 62.0+/-7.4 yrs completed the study.

However, a single-night treatment interruption may be associated with a lesser severity of sleep apneas than before treatment. We hypothesized that this decrease in severity of sleep apneas reflects changes in the respiratory response to upper airway obstruction. Therefore, we compared indexes of respiratory effort during sleep in 25 patients with OSA before and after 1 year of CPAP treatment. Respiratory effort was assessed by means of an esophageal balloon. After 1 year of CPAP treatment, there was a decrease in the maximal end-apneic esophageal pressure swings (Pes) (from 56.7 +/- 5.4 to 30.3 +/- 2.6 cm H2O; p = 0.000; mean +/- SEM), in the overall increase in Pes during an apnea (35.2 +/- 3.6 vs 16.5 +/- 1.5 cm H2O; p = 0.000), as well as the rate of increase in Pes (1.1 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 cm H2O/s; p = 0.000). Although body mass index (BMI) did not change significantly, the individual changes in BMI significantly correlated with the changes in respiratory effort after 1 year of CPAP treatment. Apnea duration and apnea-related oxygen desaturation also decreased significantly.

This study investigates the levels of circulating nitric oxide (NO), measured as serum nitrites and nitrates, in the early morning in OSA subjects compared with control subjects, and the effect of overnight nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) in OSA subjects. Thirty men with moderate to severe OSA (age = 41.9 +/- 9.0; apnea-hypopnea index, AHI = 48.0 +/- 18.1) were compared with 40 healthy men (age = 40.6 +/- 5.4; AHI = 1.4 +/- 1.2). Serum nitrite/nitrate levels were significantly lower in OSA subjects (OSA = 38.9 +/- 22.9 microM, control subjects = 63.1 +/- 47.5 microM, p = 0.015). There was significant negative correlation between serum nitrites/nitrates and the following parameters: AHI (r = -0.389, p = 0.001), oxygen desaturation time (r = -0.346, p = 0.004), and systolic blood pressure (BP) (r = -0.335, p = 0.005). Stepwise multiple linear regression with systolic or diastolic BP as the dependent variable identified serum nitrites/nitrates as the only significant correlate. Twenty-two OSA subjects had measurements of serum NO at baseline and after an overnight application nCPAP. There was significant increase in serum NO after nCPAP (baseline = 30.5 +/- 14.4 microM, after nCPAP = 81.0 +/- 82.1 microM, p = 0.01). This study demonstrates, for the first time, that circulating NO is suppressed in OSA, and this is promptly reversible with the use of nCPAP. The findings offer support for nitric oxide being one of the mediators involved in the acute hemodynamic regulation and long-term vascular remodeling in OSA."

            "abstract": "Using the Volterra-Wiener approach, we employed a minimal model to quantitatively characterize the linear and nonlinear effects of respiration (RCC) and arterial blood pressure (ABR) on heart rate variability (HRV) in normal controls and subjects with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Respiration, R-R interval (RRI), blood pressure (BP) and other polysomnographic variables were recorded in eight normal controls and nine OSAS subjects in wakefulness, Stage 2 and rapid eye-movement sleep. To increase respiratory and cardiovascular variability, a preprogrammed ventilator delivered randomly timed inspiratory pressures that were superimposed on a baseline continuous positive airway pressure. Except for lower resting RRI in OSAS subjects, summary statistical measures of RRI and BP and their variabilities were similar in controls and OSAS. In contrast, RCC and ABR gains were significantly lower in OSAS. Nonlinear ABR gain and the interaction between respiration and blood pressure in modulating RRI were substantially reduced in OSAS. ABR gain increased during sleep in controls but remained unchanged in OSAS. These findings suggest that normotensive OSAS subjects have impaired daytime parasympathetic and sympathetic function. Nonlinear minimal modeling of HRV provides a useful, insightful, and comprehensive approach for the detection and assessment of abnormal autonomic function in OSAS."

Twelve normal subjects were studied during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (Stages 2 to 4) while receiving negative (NPV, 8 subjects) or positive (PPV, 4 subjects) pressure ventilation and during spontaneous breathing. EMGdia (surface), end-tidal CO2 pressure (PETCO2), esophageal pressure (Pe), and ventilation were measured with a flow-through hood (NPV) or a mask (PPV). The following results were obtained during steady-state (3 to 22 min) mechanical ventilation. (1) A decrease in PETCO2 of 2 to 6 mm Hg resulted in elimination of phasic EMGdia in all subjects. Inhibition of respiratory muscle EMG (and a positive shift in Pe) occurred coincident with the breath-by-breath reduction in PETCO2, so that EMGdia was usually eliminated after the initial 4 to 6 breaths while using the ventilator. (2) Returning PETCO2 to the spontaneous sleeping level by adding CO2 to the inspired air (isocapnic mechanical ventilation) caused significant increases in EMGdia. During this isocapnic mechanical ventilation, however, EMGdia usually remained less than during eucapnic control. (3) Stopping the ventilator during hypocapnic ventilation caused a prolongation of expiratory time (TE) that was proportional to the degree of hypocapnia during the mechanical ventilation (100 to 1,200% increase over control). During isocapnic ventilation, cessation of mechanical ventilation caused no change in TE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We sought to determine whether the airway stabilizing effect of GG activation is enhanced when EELV is increased. To investigate this aim, 15 continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)-treated OSA patients were instrumented with an epiglottic catheter, intramuscular GG-EMG electrodes, magnetometers, and a nasal mask/pneumotachograph.

In contrast, there was a significant effect of CPAP on the change (improvement) in insulin sensitivity (0.330, 95% CI=0.001, 0.658; P=0.049; three studies, 39 patients).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The limited available evidence from randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies suggests that CPAP does not decrease HbA1c level or BMI in patients with OSA and T2DM but may improve insulin sensitivity."

            "abstract": "The positive association between the ratio of serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cardiovascular events has recently been receiving much attention. However, the association between the severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and this ratio has not yet been investigated. Accordingly, we sought to clarify this association and the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on the ratio. We performed polysomnography and LDL-C/HDL-C measurements in 215 patients who were suspected of having OSA. Furthermore, LDL-C/HDL-C was again evaluated 6 months after polysomnography in 30 OSA patients for whom CPAP therapy was initiated and continued, and in 11 age- and sex-matched OSA patients for whom the therapy could not be initiated. The LDL-C/HDL-C correlated positively with apnea-hypopnea index (ρ = 0.28, P < .001) and negatively with the lowest arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (ρ = -0.30, P < .001). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that ln apnea-hypopnea index (or ln lowest arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation) was independently associated with LDL-C/HDL-C. The LDL-C/HDL-C decreased after 6 months in the CPAP group (2.29 ± 0.67 to 2.11 ± 0.74, P = .02), whereas it did not change in the non-CPAP group (2.65 ± 0.82 to 2.62 ± 0.66, P = .81). The severity of OSA was independently associated with LDL-C/HDL-C, and LDL-C/HDL-C was significantly reduced at 6 months after CPAP therapy. These findings suggest that LDL-C/HDL-C increases in proportion to the severity of OSA, which may contribute partly to an increased risk for cardiovascular events in OSA patients."

            "abstract": "Nine patients with severe, predominantly obstructive sleep apnoea syndromes were treated during one night by continuous positive pressure under polygraphic monitoring. Three patients did not tolerate the treatment for either mechanical reasons (2 cases) or ventilatory reasons (1 case). In the remaining 6 patients, continuous positive pressure resulted in reorganization of sleep and disappearance of obstructive and central apnoeic episodes. This effect was incomplete at low pressure (2 cm H2O) and complete at pressures of 6 to 10 cm H2O. The fact that continuous positive pressure was effective against both obstructive and central apnoea suggests that its mode of action is not purely mechanical but involves the central ventilatory control, probably by a reflex mechanism. In view of its effectiveness, continuous positive pressure appears to be the treatment of choice for sleep apnoea syndromes."

Measurement of the vertical position of the hyoid bone was made relative to a number of planes validated by numerous previous cephalometric investigations, and these were recorded along with the apnoea/hypopnoea index (AHI), and subsequent management (mandibular repositioning appliances (MRA) / continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)).

Alternatively, abnormalities in ventilatory load compensation may be a consequence of the manifestations of OSA. This investigation was designed to determine if impairment of awake inspiratory load compensation exists in OSA and to determine if abnormalities in this parameter are reversible by nasal CPAP therapy. A new technique for assessment of awake inspiratory load compensation was devised to standardize the degree of ventilatory stimulation applied during load compensation assessment in each subject. This eliminates intersubject differences in degree of ventilatory stimulation during testing, which are inevitable with standard techniques and which have been shown to affect the measurement of load compensation. Inspiratory load compensation was assessed during resting room air ventilation and during steady state CO2 and exercise stimulation titrated to provide similar degrees of ventilatory stimulation in each subject. Impairment of awake inspiratory load compensation was found during all conditions in the patients with moderate to severe OSA studied compared with that in weight-matched control subjects. Normalization of awake inspiratory load compensation was observed after 4 wk of nasal CPAP therapy in five patients.

Fifty-one (61%) of 84 children with parasomnia had a diagnosis of an additional sleep disorder: 49 with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and 2 with restless leg syndrome (RLS). Twenty-nine of the children with both parasomnia and SDB had a positive family history of parasomnias, and 24 of the 29 also had a positive family history of SDB. Of the 51 children with associated sleep disorders, 45 were treated. Forty-three of 49 children with SDB were treated with tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and/or turbinate revision, and 2 of 2 children with RLS were treated with Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, at bedtime. Treatment of the precipitating sleep disorder eliminated parasomnias in all 45 children. In all 43 children who received surgery, polysomnography performed 3 to 4 months later indicated the disappearance of SDB. The recordings also showed an absence of confusional arousals. The number of EEG arousals significantly decreased from a mean of 9 +/- 2.6 EEG arousals > or =3 seconds/hour during total sleep time to 3 +/- 1.5. The number of EEG arousals > or =3 seconds during the first sleep cycle of slow wave sleep (stage 3-4 non-rapid eye movement sleep) decreased from 4 +/- 1.4 to 1 +/- 0.2.

The periodic limb movemia since treatment. The periodic limb movement syndrome arousal index (number of EEG arousals associated with periodic limb movement/hour) decreased from 11 and 16 to 0 and 0.2, respectively. Parasomnia persisted in the 6 children who were untreated for SDB. Surgeons had refused to perform surgery on these children because of lack of data on the relationship between parasomnia and SDB-related tonsil and adenoid enlargement.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive polysomnographies, discrete patterns (eg, nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high theta or slow alpha EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children's respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula/pressure transducer system and/or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement. It remains to be investigated whether a genetic factor directly influences sleep terror and sleepwalking or instead influences other disorders that fragment sleep and lead to confusional arousals. Additional studies are needed to investigate the association between SDB and non-;rapid eye movement parasomnias in the general population."

            "abstract": "Rationale:\n        \n      \n      Dyslipidemia is common in Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Postprandial lipidemia (PPL) is a strong marker of cardiovascular risk. Evidence that OSA treatment improves PPL is lacking.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To investigate the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on postprandial lipidemia (PPL) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in the upper moderate or severe range.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial, we compared the effects of 2 months each of therapeutic and placebo CPAP on PPL.\n    \n\n\n          Measurements and main results:\n        \n      \n      PPL was determined from the area under the 24-hour triglyceride concentration curve (TAG-AUC(24)) using seven blood samples drawn across both the wake and sleep periods. Secondary outcomes were the difference in other 24-hour lipid profiles. Thirty-eight eligible patients were randomly assigned to a treatment order and 29 patients completed the trial. CPAP reduced PPL compared with placebo with a mean TAG-AUC(24) difference of -357 mmol/L/d (95% confidence interval [CI], -687.3 to -26.8; P = 0.035). During both the CPAP and placebo studies, TAG levels peaked during both wakefulness (2:00 p.m.) and sleep (3:00 a.m.). Both peaks were lower during CPAP than placebo: 2:00 p.m., -0.49 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.74 to -0.24; P < 0.0005) and 3:00 a.m., -0.40 mmol/L (95% CI, -0.65 to -0.15; P = 0.002). Moreover, mean 24-hour total cholesterol was -0.19 mmol/L lower on CPAP (95% CI, -0.27 to -0.11; P < 0.00001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This randomized trial demonstrated that treatment of severe OSA with CPAP improves postprandial TAG and total cholesterol levels. These effects may reduce the risk for cardiovascular events. The results imply that the association between OSA and cardiovascular disease may, in part, be caused by direct effects on dyslipidemia.

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death. The aim of this review was to study the relationship between OSA and ventricular arrhythmias.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases were searched with MESH headings to find studies linking OSA and ventricular arrhythmias including ventricular ectopy, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Studies were graded by a scoring system, and an attempt was made to pool data.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were no matched cohort or case control studies to study the association between OSA and ventricular arrhythmias. Given data heterogeneity, pooling and meta-analysis of data were not possible. An attempt was made to judge the quality of evidence and present a systematic review. Patients with OSA were noted to have higher odds of ventricular ectopy, and were at a higher risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Associations included higher QTc dispersion and HR variability. We did not, however, find any clear evidence for a direct correlation between increased apnea hypopnea index and increased VT or VF.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Pooling and meta-analysis of studies linking OSA and ventricular arrhythmias were not possible due to heterogeneity of data. In a systemic review of studies, patients with OSA were noted to have higher odds of ventricular ectopy and arrhythmias. A single study showed that CPAP may help lower arrhythmogenicity; however, it was unclear if CPAP lowered the risk of VT. Further research should focus on studying the association of OSA and causes of sudden cardiac death, including ventricular arrhythmias."
