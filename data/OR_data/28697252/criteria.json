The searches included MEDLINE via Ovid (from January 1, 1946, to March 2017), EMBASE (from January 1, 1974, to March 2017), and the Cochrane Library database (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, no date restriction) using relevant text words and Medical Subject Headings that consisted of terms relating to randomized trial and sleep apnea (see the eAppendix in the Supplement for detailed search strategy). The search was limited to randomized clinical trials (RCTs) but without language restriction. Additionally, reference lists from trials, review articles, and reports were manually scanned to identify any other relevant data (including conference abstracts). The clinicaltrials.gov website was searched for RCTs that were registered as completed but not yet published.",
