We performed systematic searches in Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), from inception until July 31, 2021 (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Hand searches of reference lists of reviews, protocols, abstracts, and gray literature (eg, websites mentioning relevant studies) were performed to supplement searches.
