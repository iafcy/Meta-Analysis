Whole serum proteins, albumin, C-reactive protein, glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglyceroles (triglycerides), apolipoprotein-B and electrophoretic levels of alpha-lipoprotein, beta-lipoprotein and pre-beta-lipoprotein were analysed immediately after the first clinical inspection in the hospital and then 30 days after treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The intensity of pain estimated by the visual analogue scale (VAS) was higher in patients with acute pancreatitis than in patients with fractures. In both diagnoses during persisting pain, the products of lipid metabolism such as triacylglyceroles and HDL-cholesterol were enhanced together with glucose levels. Electrophoretic measurements, revealed higher levels of beta-lipoproteins in fractures, and increased values of pre-beta-lipoproteins and alpha-lipoproteins in both groups of patients suffering from pain. After 30 days of treatment some indicators decreased, but when compared with normal values, they were still higher, especially in patients with pancreatitis (HDL-cholesterol, triacylglyceroles, pre-beta-lipoprotein). In control patients without pain symptoms, an increase of LDL cholesterol, triacylglyceroles and beta-lipoprotein were observed during their stay in hospital, which may be considered to be due to hospitalisation stress per se. Acute stress generally influences glucose levels so that their increase cannot be considered as a specific marker of pain intensity.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      It may be concluded from our investigation, that the biochemical composition of the blood serum is changing during painful states, although the question still remains open to what extent these changes reflect the pain intensity and to what extent they may modulate the perception of pain."

We also evaluated the effect of bezafibrate on hypercoagulability in 10 hyperlipidemic NIDDM patients. The plasma levels of FPT and fibrinogen were significantly higher in hyperlipidemic NIDDM patients than in normolipidemic NIDDM patients and controls. Plasma levels of PAI-1 and D-dimer were significantly higher in normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic NIDDM patients compared with controls. The FPT was correlated with the HbA1c, the body mass index, and levels of total cholesterol, fibrinogen and PAI-1. Six-months therapy with bezafibrate reduced the levels of FPT, triglycerides and basal insulin, but did not alter levels of fibrinogen, PAI-1 and D-dimer. Our results showed that the FPT was useful for detection of hypercoagulability and evaluation of the effect of drugs. The increased FPT in patients with NIDDM suggested that hypercoagulability was present in association with hyperlipidemia."

However, the optimal dietary strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention is still far from being defined. Mediterranean and vegetarian diets are those reporting the greatest grade of evidence in the literature, but no experimental studies comparing these two dietary patterns are available.\n## METHODS/DESIGN\nThis is an open randomized crossover clinical trial including healthy subjects with a low-to-medium cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by being overweight and by the presence of at least an additional metabolic risk factor (abdominal obesity, high total cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, impaired glucose fasting levels) but free from medications. A total of 100 subjects will be included and randomly assigned to two groups: Mediterranean calorie-restricted diet (n = 50) and vegetarian calorie-restricted diet (n = 50). The intervention phases will last 3 months each, and at the end of intervention phase I the groups will be crossed over. The two diets will be isocaloric and of three different sizes (1400 - 1600 - 1800 kcal/day), according to specific energy requirements. Adherence to the dietary intervention will be established through questionnaires and 24-h dietary recall. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood samples and stool samples will be obtained from each participant at the beginning and at the end of each intervention phase. The primary outcome measure will be change in weight from baseline. The secondary outcome measures will be variations of anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance variables as well as traditional and innovative cardiovascular biomarkers.\n## DISCUSSION\nDespite all the data supporting the efficacy of Mediterranean and vegetarian diets on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, no studies have directly compared these two dietary profiles. The trial will test whether there are statistically significant differences between these dietary profiles in reducing the cardiovascular risk burden for the general population.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02641834.\n"

In females, those with macrovascular disease had higher levels of serum triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, as well as lower HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol and apoprotein A-1, than those without. On multivariate analysis, LDL cholesterol was the most important association with macrovascular disease in males and apoprotein A-1 in females. In a subgroup of 36 patients, a double-blind placebo controlled study using bezafibrate or placebo, in addition to conventional oral hypoglycaemic therapy over 4 months, showed falls in serum and LDL cholesterol and in serum triglyceride and a rise in HDL cholesterol in the treated group. These changes should reduce the incidence of macrovascular disease in NIDDM and we suggest further prospective studies of such therapy in addition to conventional oral hypoglycaemic agents."

The effects of treatment in general, and of oral hypoglycaemic drugs in particular, on serum lipids in NIDDM are not clear. In a cross-over study, the effects of 3 months treatment with metformin glibenclamide on body weight, blood glucose control, and serum lipoproteins were compared in 35 patients with NIDDM, inadequately controlled by diet alone. Glibenclamide alone increased body weight. Glibenclamide and metformin achieved equivalent blood glucose control, independent of initial body mass index. Neither drug affected serum triglyceride. Metformin significantly reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean change -0.34 mmol/1.95% confidence intervals -0.12 to -0.57 mmol/l, p less than 0.01). Neither drug altered high density lipoprotein or subfraction cholesterol. Changes in serum lipoproteins were also studied in 14 patients with NIDDM on long term metformin therapy, after 6 weeks placebo and again 6 weeks after restarting active drug therapy. Withdrawal of metformin resulted in a rise in fasting blood glucose, HbA1, serum total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Restarting the drug reversed these changes. Multivariate analysis showed that serum total and LDL cholesterol varied with treatment, but not with glycaemic control. Metformin can therefore lower total and LDL cholesterol in NIDDM and this effect appears to be maintained long term."

Via several mechanisms (LCAT-substrate, esterification of cholesterol and transport of cholesterol, competitive LDL-inhibition) the HDL render possible the efflux of cholesterol from the vessels and its catabolism in the liver. HDL-cholesterol possesses a cardio-protective effect. As it was proved by epidemiological, clinical, angiographical and experimental studies, it is reduced in cardiovascular diseases. Its determination, in connection with the calculation of the LDL-cholesterol renders possible diagnostic and prognostic evidence concerning the coronary risk. For males the standard risk is in a HDL-cholesterol of 35-55 mg/dl (0.9-1.4 mmol/l) and for females of 45-65 mg/dl (1.2-1.7 mmol/l). A series of influence factors and diseases which are cited have influence on the HDL-cholesterol-concentration.

The present trial was designed to evaluate the effects of physical activity as an adjunct to standard diabetes therapy on the lipid profile, blood pressure, glycaemic control, weight and body fat. Sixteen well-controlled (HbA1c 7.5%) patients with NIDDM participated in a regular aerobic exercise training programme at 50-70% maximal effort over 3 months. Thirteen age- and sex-matched patients with NIDDM served as a control group. The 3-month intervention with an increase in physical activity from 92 (mean +/- SD) +/- 79 to 246 +/- 112 min per week (p < 0.001) by means of a structured activity programme resulted in significant improvement of plasma lipids with a 20% decrease in triglycerides (p < 0.05), unchanged total cholesterol and increases in high-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein-3 subfraction of 23% (p < 0.001) and 26% (p < 0.001), respectively.

CD36, a class B scavenger cell surface receptor mediates internalization of oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) leading to the formation of macrophage foam cells. CD36 deficiency is related to phenotypic expression of the metabolic syndrome, frequently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases resulting in raised levels of glucose thereby contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Therefore, the association of human CD36 gene mutation to T2DM needs investigation. We undertook this study to investigate CD36 gene status in north Indian subjects by screening for the deletion of exons 3, 4 and 5 and certain polymorphisms.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Clinical characteristics were compared between 300 T2DM patients and 100 healthy controls.

Genotyping studies of the two SNPs in the CD36 gene confirmed the absence of exons 4 and 5 deletion. This is perhaps the first report from India suggesting that CD36 is one of the several important genes that need to be explored in relation to T2DM."

Patients who were obese at diagnosis lost more weight during the study than non-obese patients (mean 13.2 versus 5.6% average body weight), and showed a significant increase in serum HDL-cholesterol levels.

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of long term exercise on glycemic and metabolic control measured after eight months in contrast to patients who had ceased their training after four months.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      After an effective 4 months' strength training or endurance training period, ten patients (5 male and 5 female, mean age +/- SE:57.1 +/- 1.6 yr) were randomised to a further 4 months of combined endurance and strength training, while a control group of 10 patients (5 male and 5 female, mean age +/- SE:56.9 +/- 1.6 yr) ceased training.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Long term glycemic control improved and HbA1C values fell from 6.9 +/- 0.4 to 6.2 +/- 0.2 in active patients and increased from 7.5 +/- 0.4 to 8.7 +/- 0.6 in control patients (p = 0.002). Baseline levels of total cholesterol significantly decreased in training group (205.5 mg/dl +/- 14.1 to 177.5 +/- 13.3) and increased in controls (185.9 +/- 14.1 to 220.2 +/- 15.8) [p = 004]. In addition, significant decreases in LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels (both p < 05) were observed in the training group compared to controls.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      This study showed that in addition to a 4 month training period, continuation of training proved highly beneficial with further reductions in fasting blood glucose, HbA1C, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, and an elevation in HDL-cholesterol concentrations in diabetes mellitus type 2 patients, thus resulting in a reduced atherogenic lipid profile. In contrast, patients who ceased training after 4 months developed an atherogenic lipid profile and a worsened glycemic control. The results of this study indicate that long term exercise plays an important role in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 and may protect against the development of cardiovascular diseases."

Some studies have suggested that the effect is less pronounced during treatment with selective beta-blockers. The effects of 2 such drugs, metoprolol 200 mg/day and atenolol 50 mg/day, have been compared in 50 hypertensive patients (WHO Stage I-II), mean age 47 years. Serum lipoproteins were determined in 20 patients before treatment and after treatment with either drug for 3 months. Both drugs were equally effective in reducing blood pressure. After atenolol the initial VLDL-cholesterol concentration of 1.04 mmol/l had not changed, but it rose to 1.29 mmol/l after metoprolol (p less than 0.05). The HDL-cholesterol concentration 1.42 mmol/l did not fall during atenolol treatment, but during metoprolol there was a small reduction to 1.31 mmol/l (p less than 0.05). Hyperlipoproteinaemia is common in hypertensive patients, 40% of the present group had hypertriglyceridaemia and 25% had hypercholesterolaemia. Thus, atenolol 50 mg was found not to affect lipoproteins, whereas metoprolol 200 mg increased the VLDL concentration in 75% of the patients."

The presence of both factors augments the potential risk. The question arises, therefore, as to whether cigarette smoking has a direct effect on the plasma lipoproteins and, in particular, on the atherogenetic low density lipoproteins. In this study, the influence of cigarette smoking on the lipoprotein profile was investigated in a defined cohort of 6,543 male industrial workers aged 40-59 years, consisting of 2,434 smokers and 3,975 non-smokers. The effect of smoking on the lipoprotein profile showed no significant changes in LDL and only slight changes in the other lipoprotein fractions. Other factors, such as alcohol intake, body weight, and general life style seem to have a greater influence on HDL-cholesterol than smoking. It is concluded that smoking does not significantly alter lipid metabolism and that minor differences observed between smokers and non-smokers are due to a variety of factors, rather than a reflection of a direct metabolic relationship."

            "abstract": "Serum high density lipoproteins (HDL) are a protective factor against atherosclerosis. Many epidemiological studies show a strong inverse relationship between serum HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and the likelihood of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). HDL-C levels appear to be a stronger predictive factor for CAD than serum total or low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. In the presence of high HDL-C levels, the development of CAD is unlikely even in persons with increased total or LDL-C. Conversely, subjects with low serum levels of HDL-C are at increased risk even if their total and LDL-C is within the \"desirable\" range. A number of studies have also shown that increasing HDL-C levels is associated with both primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis. HDL-C levels should be estimated in individuals with family and/or personal history of premature atherosclerosis, even if they have normal total cholesterol. Only the current problems with the accuracy and precision of the serum HDL-C assay prevent it from being the single most important test for assessment of the lipid risk factors for CAD. The most frequent causes of low HDL-C are smoking, obesity, and hypertriglyceridemia. Treatment of low HDL-C includes removal of these factors, and if this is ineffective, use of drugs. Gemfibrozil and niacin are most effective in raising serum HDL-C, although a number of other medications can markedly improve the total:HDL-C ratio."

In the former patients, no risk factors were different between the 13 patients with still no lacuna and the nine patients with lacuna-developed after 5 years. In the latter patients, the 17 patients with worsening lacunar state had significantly higher systolic blood pressure, and a higher prevalence of macroalbuminuria than the 12 patients with no increment of lacuna. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that macroalbuminuria after 5 years was the only contributing factor to the increased lacuna. Therefore, in the NIDDM, macroalbuminuria induced an increase of lacuna in magnetic resonance imaging, although numbers of cases were relatively small. Prevention of the development of macroalbuminuria are essential to avoid the progression of asymptomatic lacuna."

The diabetic subjects were divided into three groups, normoalbuminuric, microalbuminuric and macroalbuminuric NIDDM, based on the amount of albuminuria. The average diameter of LDL particles was determined by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient (2-16%) gel electrophoresis. The plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations were comparable between the non-diabetic controls and normoalbuminuric NIDDM, whereas the plasma triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) or LDL concentration was significantly increased in diabetic nephropathy. The mean LDL particle size was significantly smaller in microalbuminuric NIDDM compared with the controls or normoalbuminuric NIDDM, and the LDL size was further decreased in macroalbuminuric NIDDM. The incidence of small LDL (diameter < 255 A) was remarkably increased in microalbuminuric (58%) and macroalbuminuric NIDDM (67%) compared to the control (13%) and normoalbuminuric NIDDM (27%). Corresponding to the decreased LDL size, the cholesterol content of the LDL was significantly depleted in NIDDM with nephropathy. The high prevalence of small LDL in diabetic nephropathy was also observed even when hypertriglyceridemic or hypertensive subjects were excluded from each group. The increment in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein (d < 1.006) after oral fat-loading was increased, and postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity was decreased significantly in diabetic nephropathy. These abnormalities were significantly associated with LDL particle size. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the amount of albuminuria was closely associated with the average LDL particle size, and this association was independent of the plasma triglyceride level. Neither insulin resistance nor glycemic control was directly associated with LDL particle diameter. The present study indicates that LDL particles become smaller in diabetic nephropathy, and this may be associated primarily with abnormal triglyceride metabolism. However, in addition to hypertriglyceridemia, other metabolic abnormalities caused by diabetic nephropathy may also be involved in the pathogenesis of small LDL particles."

The reasons for this higher relative risk in NIDDM women than in NIDDM men is not completely understood. Since some studies suggest that duration of clinical diabetes and degree of hyperglycaemia have only a modest effect on coronary heart disease risk, we hypothesized that women who eventually convert to NIDDM might have a more atherogenic pattern of lipids and blood pressure relative to subjects who do not convert than male converters, even in the prediabetic period. We examined this issue in Mexican-American subjects in the 8-year follow-up of the San Antonio Heart Study. Seventy-nine out of 801 men converted to NIDDM compared to 133 out of 1131 women. In both men and women, conversion to NIDDM was significantly associated with increased body mass index, fasting insulin and glucose, higher triglyceride and blood pressure and lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The relative differences between converters and non-converters was significantly greater for women than for men; this interaction term for gender by conversion status was statistically significant for fasting insulin, triglyceride, HDL cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. Thus, the higher relative risk for coronary heart disease in women with NIDDM relative to men with NIDDM may be partially due to their greater burden of cardiovascular risk factors even prior to the onset of diabetes."

Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is recognized as a marker of early atherosclerosis and used to predict future vascular events. Among the common lipid parameters, LDL has strongest relation with carotid plaque. Cumulative effect of achieving optimal levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and blood pressure is a reduced risk of recurrent stroke and major cardiovascular events. The protective effect of higher HDL-C is maintained at low levels of LDL-C. Studies have demonstrated a trend toward a higher risk of stroke with lower HDL-C and support HDL-C as an important modifiable stroke risk factor. In patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack and no coronary heart disease, only lower baseline HDL-C predicted the risk of recurrent stroke. Substantial amount of residual cardiovascular risk remains in patients treated with statins due to elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C, even when LDL-C is well controlled. Niacin promotes significant increase in HDL-C and reduces cardiovascular risk. By combining niacin with the LDL-lowering therapy of statins, the progression of atherosclerosis is slowed down and residual cardiovascular and risk of stroke is reduced. Non-pharmacological control of serum lipids includes regular physical activity and modification in daily diet. In primary prevention, when HDL-C is below the average and other risk factors are present, a statin added to non-pharmacological therapy is appropriate choice. Fibrate therapy may be appropriate in men with manifest coronary disease with isolated low HDL-C. If HDL-C remains low, with or without high triglyceride levels, a fibrate or niacin may be added."

Thirty-six patients had microalbuminuria (UAE 20-200 micrograms/min), and 105 had normal UAE (less than 20 micrograms/min). At follow-up, an average of 3.4 yr later, 14 patients had died. There was a highly significant excess mortality (chiefly from cardiovascular disease) among those with microalbuminuria (28%) compared to those without microalbuminuria (4%, P less than 0.001). In univariate survival analysis, significant predictors of all-cause mortality included microalbuminuria (P less than 0.001), hypercholesterolemia (P less than 0.01), hypertriglyceridemia (P less than 0.05), and preexisting coronary heart disease (P less than 0.05).

Blood was taken before and then 1, 6 and 12 months after initiating 10 or 20 mg daily of pravastatin. The cholesterol concentration in whole plasma and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), plasma triglyceride and apolipoprotein (apo) B were all significantly decreased within the first month. These changes lasted for 1 year. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol increased in the first month but returned to base line thereafter. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol tended to decrease in the first month, and was suppressed significantly from the 6th month (11%) to the 12th month (16%). The effect of pravastatin on LDL-cholesterol in NIDDM was slower and weaker than that published for non-diabetic hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the mechanism by which pravastatin suppresses plasma cholesterol levels in these two conditions may differ. After 1 year, no adverse effects were noted on hematopoietic, hepatic or renal function. Blood glucose level, hemoglobin A1c and the insulin response to oral glucose were unchanged. In addition, serum creatine phosphokinase showed no abnormal increase. Careful ophthalmological examinations before and after pravastatin treatment revealed no development of new lenticular opacities.

According to the quality of their metabolic control the children were divided into 3 groups: Group 1, children in good metabolic control; Group 2, children in poor metabolic control but without ketosis; Group 3, children in severe ketoacidosis; 15 normal children (Group 4) served as controls. No hypercholesterolemia was found. As to blood sugar and serum triglyceride levels, significant differences were found between the control group and the diabetic groups as well as between the diabetic groups. When evaluating the result of HDL-cholesterol determinations we found a significant difference between the control group and Groups 2 and 3, as well as between diabetics in good control (Group 1) compared to Groups 2 and 3. We also found a correlation in diabetics in good control between blood sugar values and high HDL-cholesterol levels, and in diabetics in poor control between high blood sugar values and low HDL-cholesterol levels. No correlation was found between HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in diabetes in poor metabolic control. In view of these findings the importance of reaching an optimal metabolic control in insulin-dependent children is emphasized, and the role of normoglycemia in the prevention of atherosclerosis is stressed."

            "abstract": "Abdominal obesity constitutes an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration constitute the major lipid alterations observed in obesity. A common variant of the lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene, the HindIII polymorphism, has been found to be associated with changes in triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. We have investigated the impact of the LPL HindIII polymorphism on the relationship between abdominal adiposity and lipoprotein concentrations in 156 randomly selected women in a cross-sectional study conducted in the province of Gerona, in the northeast of Spain. The waist-to-hip ratio was used as an estimate of regional fat distribution. Serum lipid and lipoprotein measurements as well as lipoprotein lipase-HindIII genotypes were determined. Percentile 50 of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (0.81) was used as a cutoff to define low or high WHR groups, which significantly differed in blood pressure and lipid trait concentrations. Serum triglyceride concentrations and mean log triglyceride-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio were significantly higher in H+ homozygous women compared with H- carriers. Whereas no statistically-significant differences were observed in HDL-cholesterol concentration and log triglyceride-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio of H- carriers between WHR groups, H+ homozygous women showed significant differences in these lipid traits. It is noteworthy that high-WHR H- carrier women showed a mean HDL-cholesterol value similar to those of both genotypes in the low WHR group. A statistically significant interaction between WHR and genotype was observed for HDL-cholesterol concentration (P=0. 027) and log triglyceride-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio (P=0.040). These results stress the compensating effects that weight loss may have on women with adverse genetic factors. From a complementary viewpoint, the presence of the H- allele seems to confer a protective lipid profile, even when an adverse anthropometric factor such as abdominal adiposity is present."

Univariate analysis showed that LDL particle size was significantly and positively correlated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and was inversely correlated with the levels of total plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HbA1C, and body mass index (BMI). Stepwise regression analysis selected four independent contributing variables that could affect LDL particle size; triglyceride levels, HDL cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol levels, and HbA1C levels. Similar regression analysis performed for men and for normotensive subjects showed that HbA1C levels also independently influenced LDL particle size. The results indicate that HbA1C levels have a significant effect on LDL particle size. This suggests that small LDL particles would be present in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus regardless of plasma lipid concentrations."

            "abstract": "Dyslipidaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes commonly consists of elevated triglyceride levels; normal or slightly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels with a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles; and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels with a preponderance of small, dense HDL. These abnormalities are closely connected, with prolonged residence of high levels of triglyceride-rich particles in the circulation favoring abnormalities in LDL and HDL. Each of these factors has been associated with endothelial dysfunction; each contributes directly or indirectly to atheroma formation, with small, dense LDL and triglyceride-rich remnants increasing deposition of cholesteryl ester in vessel walls. This process is facilitated by reduced reverse cholesterol transport in association with low levels of HDL-cholesterol and abnormal HDL. Lipid-lowering therapy focused on LDL-cholesterol reduction is highly successful in preventing coronary disease in diabetic patients. Additional strategies for treating the cluster of risk factors in dyslipidaemia are necessary to further reduce atherosclerotic disease in this population."

We studied 46 patients with NIDDM (26 women, 20 men) treated either with diet alone or in combination with sulfonylureas. Insulin sensitivity was assessed as the insulin-mediated glucose uptake rate (M value) with the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. In a multiple regression model, only percent body fat, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and resting energy expenditure (REE) emerged as significant independent determinants of the M value, with a multiple R2 for the model of 44%, whereas age, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, thyroid function, fitness level, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and dietary habits did not contribute significantly. The M value was independently and negatively associated with the concentrations of triglyceride (TG) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and positively associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol subfractions and apolipoprotein A1. In our predominantly normotensive subjects, we found no association between the M value and blood pressure. Moreover, fasting insulin contributed directly, ie, independent of the M value, to the variation of TG, but not to the other lipoproteins and not to blood pressure. The results suggest that in NIDDM (1) insulin sensitivity is determined mainly by percentage body fat and REE, (2) the insulin level determines the TG level directly, whereas the lipoproteins are influenced indirectly as a reflection of the degree of insulin resistance, and (3) insulin sensitivity is not related to blood pressure in a normotensive population."

            "abstract": "Statins are microorganism derived drugs that greatly impair the cell synthesis of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Statins, however lower the blood level of cholesterol chiefly by increasing the number of high affinity receptors that recognize plasma LDL and by diminishing the VLDL synthesis rate in the liver. The latter explains the mild triglyceride reducing effect of these drugs. Statins efficiency in lowering the plasma cholesterol concentration is comparable to that of the bile acid binding polymers, but is better than that of the fibrates and nicotinic acid. Statins are better tolerated than the latter two drugs but are less efficient in lowering plasma triglycerides and in increasing the HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Tissue selectivity varies for the different statins but this is a secondary issue when the rarity of side effects is taken into account. Statins should be prescribed considering solely their pharmacologic efficiency and cost. Coronary angiography studies in coronary heart disease patients treated with placebo as compared to statins alone, or combined to other lipid lowering drugs, indicate that coronary artery disease regression can be achieved by pharmacological means."

Twelve healthy men and six healthy women with a mean age of 26 ± 6.6 years and an aged-matched control group were recruited for this prospective interventional study. Subjects in the intervention group aimed for a body weight increase of 5-15% by doubling the baseline caloric intake by eating at least two fast food-based meals a day in combination with adoption of a sedentary lifestyle for 4 weeks. This protocol induced a weight gain from 67.6 ± 9.1 kg to 74.0 ± 11 kg (P < 0.001). A numerical increase in the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol occurred in all subjects during the study and this was apparent already at the first week in 16/18 subjects (mean increase at week 1: +22.0 ± 16%, range from -7 to +50%), whereas the highest level of HDL during the study as compared with baseline values varied from +6% to +58% (mean +31.6 ± 15%). The intake of saturated fat in the early phase of the trial related positively with the HDL-cholesterol-increase in the second week (r = 0.53, P = 0.028). Although the levels of insulin doubled at week 2, the increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was only +12 ± 17%, and there was no statistically significant changes in fasting serum triglycerides. We conclude that hyperalimentation can induce a fast but transient increase in HDL-cholesterol that is of clinical interest when estimating cardiovascular risk based on serum lipid levels."

The prevalence of Type 2 diabetes increased progressively in women within the normal BMI range and in men from a BMI of 25.0. Type 2 diabetes was four times as common if the BMI was >27.0. Increasing waist measurements predicted 10-fold increases in hypertension and a three-to-five times increased risk of diabetes. Suitable waist cut-off points were 85cm for men and 80cm for women, with statistical analysis showing waist as the more dominant predictor of risk than age, waist-to-hip ratios or BMIs.

Postmenopausal women had increased concentrations of VLDL, total IDL and IDL-2 compared to controls (p < 0.05, p < 0.005 and p < 0.001 respectively). Plasma concentrations of total IDL was increased in postmenopausal women (33.6 +/- 3.4 vs 22.6 +/- 0.8 mg/dl, p < 0.005). The increase in total IDL was due to IDL-2 (19.9 +/- 1.7 vs 11.5 +/- 0.8 mg/dl, p < 0.001, in postmenopausal women vs controls). The IDL-2 subfraction was 60 +/- 2.6% of total IDL in postmenopausal women and 51 +/- 2.0% in controls (p < 0.02). In postmenopausal women and in controls the ratio triglyceride/protein (which indicates particles size) was significantly higher in IDL-1 than in IDL-2 (p < 0.005 and p < 0.01 respectively), but this ratio did not show differences when VLDL, total IDL and IDL-2 were compared between postmenopausal and control women. Then, the increased plasma concentration of these lipoproteins would show an increased number of particles in the postmenopausal women vs controls. There were no differences in the Lipoprotein Lipase and Hepatic Lipase activities between both groups. Lipoprotein Lipase vs total IDL-triglycerides and IDL-2-triglycerides showed a significant inverse correlation in controls (p < 0.05) but not in postmenopausal women. We conclude that the qualitative and quantitative study of the lipoproteins shows a more atherogenic profile in the postmenopausal group, with an increase in the concentration and number of particles of VLDL, total IDL and IDL-2."

            "abstract": "This prospective study evaluated whether baseline cholesterol efflux is associated with future development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in cardiovascular patients. We measured cholesterol efflux in all CORDIOPREV study (NCT00924937) participants free of T2DM at baseline (n = 462) and assessed its relationship with T2DM incidence during a 4.5 years of follow-up. Cholesterol efflux was quantified by incubation of cholesterol-loaded THP-1 cells with the participants' apoB-depleted plasma. Disposition index was estimated as beta-cell function indicator. During follow-up 106 individuals progressed to T2DM. The cholesterol efflux/apoA-1 ratio was inversely associated with T2DM development independently of traditional risk factors (model-1, OR: 0.647, 95%CI: 0.495-0.846), and after additional adjustment for glycaemic parameters (model-2, OR: 0.670, 95%CI: 0.511-0.878). When cumulative incidence of diabetes was analysed by quartiles of cholesterol efflux/apoA-I, incidence of T2DM was reduced by 54% in subjects who were in the higher cholesterol efflux/apoA-I quartile compared to subjects in the lowest quartile (p = 0.018 and p = 0.042 for model-1 and 2). Moreover, participants who were in the higher cholesterol efflux/apoA-I presented significantly higher disposition index (β = 0.056, SE = 0.026; p = 0.035). In conclusion, HDL-cholesterol efflux normalised to apoA-I was inversely associated with T2DM development in cardiovascular patients. This association was independent of several T2DM risk factors, and may be related to a preserved beta-cell function."

            "abstract": "Patients with chronic hepatitis C have both higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM) and increased cardiovascular risk compared to never infected people. Sustained viral response (SVR) achievement led to decreasing incidence and prevalence of T2DM during the interferon era of HCV treatment. Currently, direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAA) are the gold standard for treating HCV infection, while yielding SVR in nearly all patients. In chronic HCV patients with T2DM (prediabetes most likely too), DAA therapy is associated with both better fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) controls; thus reducing pharmacotherapy in a certain part of patients is possible. Papers mentioned in the review confirmed DAA role in both total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increase. This alteration was accompanied by an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and a decrease in triglycerides (TG) verified by most of the studies. However, the clinical significance of lipoprotein alterations caused by DAA therapy has not been explained yet. Moreover, DAA treatment of chronic hepatitis C improves hypertension control and atherosclerotic plaques. It is very likely that DAA therapeutic regimens will decrease both T2DM prevalence and cardiovascular risk in chronic hepatitis C patients; further research, however, is needed."

The study population comprised 206 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients attending the out-patient clinic at a major hospital in Kuwait. Clinical history and physical examination were done and fasting blood samples were taken to determine HbA1c and lipid levels. American Diabetes Association criteria were applied to define clinical targets for lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk categories. Stepwise multiple linear regression was conducted to identify the demographic and clinical factors associated with lipid levels outside of the clinical target. The large majority of the patients were either over-weight (32%) or obese (57%); the mean BMI was 32.6 kg/m2. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were above optimal levels in 67%, 86%, and 25% of patients, respectively. For HDL-cholesterol, 63% of men and 71% of women had values below the corresponding optimal level. Only 14 patients (6.8%) had all three lipid values within the respective target level. The percentages of patients with one, two, or all three lipid values outside of target were 31%, 46%, and 16%, respectively. The most frequent (41%) pattern of dyslipidaemia was a combination of LDL-cholesterol level above target with HDL-cholesterol level below target; the second most common pattern was an isolated increase in LDL-cholesterol, observed in 21% of the patients. In the stepwise regression analyses, glycaemic control was strongly associated with dyslipidaemia (i.e. high total- and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides); female gender were associated with low HDL-cholesterol. Kuwaiti type 2 DM patients have a high prevalence of dyslipidaemia and obesity. Weight reduction, increased physical activity, improved glycaemic control, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels, along with reduced LDL-cholesterol, should be important goals of therapy in these patients to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."

Of the original 290 patients (103 males, 187 females, median age 65 years) 92.5% could be assessed, 103 subjects had died, 58 from macrovascular causes. In an univariate analysis of baseline data, deceased patients, and especially those who died from macrovascular causes had significantly higher fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, von Willebrand-factor protein, urine albumin excretion, and serum beta 2-microglobulin, were significantly older, exhibited significantly more ischaemic heart disease (abnormal ECG Minnesota codes), carotid artery and peripheral vascular disease (both determined by ultrasound-Doppler), and had significantly inferior knowledge about diabetes and its treatment. No significant differences were seen for gender, blood pressure, smoking, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, or the use of antidiabetic, antihypertensive or coronary drugs. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for macrovascular death were age, HbA1c and von Willebrand-factor protein. When baseline macrovascular disease was taken into account, carotid artery disease was also a determinant. The main variables from the metabolic syndrome (blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, body mass index) did not enter a multiple logistic regression analysis. The data suggest that age and haemoglobin A1c are major determinants, and that in addition von Willebrand-factor associated endothelial damage is a risk factor for macrovascular mortality in NIDDM patients."

These programs imply not only a medical but also an economic challenge to our health system. That is why all therapeutic measures have to be evaluated regarding their cost-effectiveness. A cost-effectiveness profile was calculated for all the therapies of hyperlipidemia (nutritional therapy, dietetic nutritionals, drugs and LDL-apheresis) with respect to the following parameters: total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The daily costs of all interventional measures are compared to the success rate, whereby an index of daily therapy costs and 1% change per lipid parameter was calculated. Nutritional therapy is by far the cheapest, and LDL-apheresis the most expensive but also the most effective and reliable therapeutic measure. It has to be considered, however, that dietary intervention can be very successful in overnutrition while in rare cases of severe homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia there is no therapeutic alternative to LDL-apheresis. Life-style modifications, such as changing nutritional habits, may contribute towards reducing or removing one or more risk factor(s) (e.g. malnutrition is associated with overweight, hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP), hyperinsulinemia (syndrome X), hyperfibrinogenemia and hypertension). But neither health politicians nor the population seem to be conscious of the fact that life-style changes help to reduce medical expenditure.

Average metabolic control was moderate (HbA1c 8.2 +/- 1.7%). Median serum Lp(a) level was 183 U l-1 (range 8-2600 U l-1), which was significantly higher than in control subjects of comparable age (median 101; range 8-1747 U l-1; P < 0.05), while HDL-cholesterol levels were lower (1.14 +/- 0.38 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.35 mmol l-1; P = 0.001), and total cholesterol levels were comparable. No significant relationships between diabetes treatment or metabolic control and Lp(a) levels were observed. In the quartile of patients with the highest Lp(a) levels, total cholesterol and triglycerides were slightly higher (P < 0.05), whereas HDL-cholesterol was not different. With increasing Lp(a) levels, higher prevalences of preproliferative retinopathy and of coronary artery disease (CAD) were observed, but not of the other complications. No relationship was found between the degree of albuminuria and Lp(a) levels. We conclude that in NIDDM patients, Lp(a) levels are elevated compared with non-diabetic subjects, and that higher Lp(a) levels are associated with higher prevalences of CAD and of retinopathy."

The subjects were examined clinically and their serum lipids, blood glucose, plasma insulin, blood pressure, and health score were determined. The health score was measured using a visual analogue scale. All subjects were followed for 5 years. Health score, diastolic blood pressure and body mass index declined over age, but serum triglycerides, and blood glucose were similar, whilst serum high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol increased. Among women fasting plasma insulin was lowest in the age group of 65 years. The associations of components of the multiple metabolic syndrome varied by age. In the age groups of 65 and 75 years high body mass index, plasma insulin, glucose, triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol were associated with impaired health. In the age group of 85 years high blood pressure, total cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol were associated with good health. The baseline health score was consistently lower in the decedents than survivors of all age groups, but components of the metabolic syndrome were generally not associated with impaired survival."

Present randomised clinical trial recruited 75 overweight/obese adults with NAFLD, who were randomly assigned into LOV-D and SWL-D groups for 3 months. The LOV-D was designed based on eliminating meat, poultry, and fish; while including dairy products and eggs. The SWL-D was planned according to the standard food pyramid, which was free in all sources of food. Adherence to LOV-D significantly outperformed SWL-D in reducing levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), body weight, waist circumference, BMI, fasting blood sugar, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triacylglycerol (TG), cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Furthermore, ultrasonography revealed a higher alleviation in NAFLD grade among LOV-D, compared with SWL-D. This study suggests that adherence to LOV-D for 3 months has beneficial effects on NAFLD improvement, anthropometric measures, glycaemic-related markers, and lipid profiles."

In men, the relationships of age with WHR and age with body mass index (BMI) were similar, an increase levelling at the age of about 50 years. In women, BMI increased linearly, but WHR exponentially with age. In both sexes, age-adjusted WHR and BMI associated positively with non-HDL cholesterol, and with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and inversely with HDL-cholesterol and the HDL/non-HDL cholesterol ratio. WHR and BMI were independently related to several cardiovascular risk factors. HDL-cholesterol concentration was 19% lower in men, and 17% lower in women who belonged to the upper tertile of both WHR and BMI, than in the subjects in the lower tertiles of WHR and BMI. Age-adjusted WHR and BMI also predicted fasting and 2-hour post-challenge blood glucose values in women aged 45 to 64 years, but not in men. The WHR provides additional information on elevated cardiovascular risk factors in cross-sectional analysis among middle-aged men and women independently of BMI. The measurement of WHR in large-scale risk factor surveys should be recommended, in order to assess the independent contribution of WHR to the risk of cardiovascular disease, and to find out the importance of WHR for the prevention of chronic diseases."

Because a low-fat plant-based diet has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that such a diet would reduce painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.\n## METHODS\nIn this 20-week pilot study, individuals with type 2 diabetes and painful diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group was asked to follow a low-fat, plant-based diet, with weekly classes for support in following the prescribed diet, and to take a vitamin B12 supplement. The control group was asked to take the same vitamin B12 supplement, but received no other intervention. At baseline, midpoint and 20 weeks, clinical, laboratory and questionnaire data were collected. Questionnaires included an analog 'worst pain' scale, Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, global impression scale, Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score, a weekly pain diary and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 20 weeks, body weight change with the intervention was -6.4 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.4 to -3.4, P<0.001) in an effect size analysis. Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot improved by an average of 12.4 microseimens (95% CI 1.2-23.6, P=0.03) with the intervention in an effect size analysis.

Among the risk factors involved are lipid disturbances, themselves divided into three factors: LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol. A plasma LDL-cholesterol level above 150 units is a high risk factor. Triglyceride levels higher than 1.50 g/l, associated with HDL levels lower than 40 mg/dl constitute a new entity, a genetic disease associated with a special fragment on chromosome 11, characterized by high risk low HDL levels (below 40). Another risk factor, even in elderly people, is arterial hypertension. Cigarette smoking, lack of physical activity, diabetes and mental stress remain important factors, whereas obesity has become a separate factor. Finally, such factors as ECG abnormalities, plasma uric acide or plasminogen levels, familial context, etc., may be taken into consideration. All dietetic and therapeutic measures aimed at lowering the cholesterol level show a 2-3 p. 100 fall in the incidence of coronary disease for each 1 p. 100 reduction of blood cholesterol. A new programme, similar to those used in screening for high blood pressure subjects, will be set up in the U.S.A. to identify people with a blood cholesterol level higher than 2.40 g/l, treat them and bring that figure down below 2.00 g/l. The management of arterial hypertension is still based on treatments which do not increase blood cholesterol or increase HDL.

Both were all-purpose cooking margarines with nearly identical functional properties. Trans fatty acids from PHFO in the traditional margarine were replaced mostly by saturated, monounsaturated and trans fatty acids of vegetable origin in the new formulation. Both test margarines contained approximately the same amount of cis polyunsaturated fatty acids. Sixteen female normolipidaemic students consumed each diet with the two test margarines for 14 d in random order (crossover design). The amount of fat was 31% energy in the PHFO diet and 32% energy in the VO diet. The test margarines provided approximately 26% energy in both diets. In the PHFO diet 7.8% of the energy was derived from trans fatty acids and 9.2% from saturated fatty acids (12:0, 14:0 and 16:0) while in the VO diet, 1.1% energy was derived from trans fatty acids and 13.3% from saturated fatty acids (12:0, 14:0 and 16:0). The natural content of cholesterol in PHFO was deliberately not balanced by addition of cholesterol to the VO diet, thus the PHFO diet contained 215 mg and the VO diet 86 mg cholesterol per 8.5 MJ. LDL-cholesterol concentration was 19% higher in subjects on the PHFO diet compared with the VO diet (P < 0.01). The ratio LDL-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol was 12.6% higher in subjects on the PHFO diet compared with the VO diet (P < 0.01). The level of apolipoprotein (apo)A-I was 6% lower in subjects on the PHFO diet compared with the VO diet (P < 0.01). The ratio apoB:apoA-I was 10.4% higher in subjects on the PHFO diet than on the VO diet (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, apoB, lipoprotein(a) and haemostatic variables between the diets. Our results demonstrate that PHFO, with its unfavourable effects on plasma lipids, can be replaced by vegetable oils in margarine without appreciable loss of functional properties but with significant improvement in the effects on plasma lipoproteins."

Within each category, being high-risk on any of the variables was high-risk; being borderline-risk on any, without being high-risk on any, was borderline-risk. Obesity severity was strongly associated with increased cardiometabolic risk, with prevalence of borderline-risk greater than high-risk. Anthropometric indicators in males and Hispanics, versus females and Whites/Blacks, respectively, had stronger associations with cardiometabolic risks. BMI and WC performed well for identifying adolescents with at least one borderline-risk or high-risk level measure for lipids, glucose and blood pressure; relationship strength varying by gender and race/ethnicity.

The 1st week of the study, all of them were on intensive insulin treatment and from day 8, four were randomized to a control group continuing with insulin, and eight to a treatment group where GLP-1 was given at meals together with regular insulin from day 8 to 12. On days 13 and 14, they were only given GLP-1 at meals. NPH insulin at bedtime was given throughout the study.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the GLP-1-treated patients, the doses of regular insulin, given to keep a satisfactory blood glucose control, were reduced compared with treatment with insulin only. GLP-1 virtually inhibited the early increase in blood glucose after the meals, whereas an increase of approximately 2 mmol was seen during an optimized insulin treatment. In agreement with the short half-life of the peptide, 2-h postprandial plasma insulin levels were significantly decreased both at day 12 and 14, suggesting that there was not enough GLP-1 left to stimulate endogenous insulin release and compensate for the decrease in the dose of exogenous insulin. Therefore, the effect of GLP-1 was lost before the next meal, resulting in increased preprandial blood glucose values at lunch and dinner. The concentration of VLDL triglycerides decreased already during the 1st week. This decrease persisted during the 2nd week when GLP-1 was included in the treatment. No changes were observed in the levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol. The LDL particle diameter increased from a mean of 22.3 to 22.6 nm (P < 0.01) in response to insulin treatment. A further increment to 22.9 nm (P < 0.05) was seen after GLP-1 treatment. The LDL particle size did not change in the control group. Lipoprotein lipase activity was decreased by 27% and hepatic lipase was reduced by 13% in the GLP-1-treated group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We confirm the antidiabetogenic effect of GLP-1 in NIDDM patients. This effect was maintained during 7 days, which implies that the patients did not develop tolerance during this treatment period. Intensive insulin treatment, leading to normotriglyceridemia, increased the mean LDL particle diameter, which is likely to lower the risk of future coronary heart disease in patients with NIDDM. Furthermore, an additive effect of GLP-1 is indicated. Hence, this study gives additional evidence that GLP-1 may be useful as an agent for treating NIDDM."

The present investigation was undertaken to identify anthropometric variables in childhood which may reflect the risk of cardiovascular disease in terms of unfavourable changes in apolipoprotein and lipid concentrations. Twenty-nine obese 14-year-olds and 32 obese 12-year-olds were recruited from a school screening programme and anthropometric data reflecting overweight and fat distribution were subjected to analysis of covariance, with blood pressure, apolipoprotein and lipid concentrations as dependent variables. Results from the two groups were adjusted for puberty, gender and screening group, allowing pooling of data. After such an adjustment, waist circumference was significantly correlated (r = partial correlation coefficient) to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (r = -0.08, p < 0.05) and triglycerides (r = +0.24, p < 0.01). The waist:hip ratio was significantly correlated to HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.10, p < 0.01) and triglycerides (r = +0.22, p < 0.01). BMI was significantly correlated to triglycerides (r = +0.25, p < 0.001), and diastolic blood pressure (r = +0.08, p < 0.05). The partial regression coefficients for waist circumference versus apolipoprotein B (r = +0.07) and the apolipoprotein B:A-I ratio (r = +0.06) were as strong as those for waist:hip ratio (r = +0.03 and r = +0.05, respectively). Our results demonstrate that abdominal obesity is associated with an unfavourable lipid profile in obese 12-14-year-old children. This may be related to an increased cardiovascular risk later in life. The waist measurement appears to be a convenient and informative anthropometric indicator of such metabolic alterations."

Several atherogenic mechanisms have been proposed to explain the association of small, dense LDL with CHD, including evidence that small, dense LDL is an integral feature of the insulin resistance syndrome. Furthermore, a recent study in elderly Finnish men and women has shown that phenotype B prospectively predicts non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).

In multivariate analysis, taking only age into consideration as a confounding factor, low initial concentration of SHBG was significantly correlated to the incidence of NIDDM and stroke, and high initial concentration of CBG was correlated to the incidence of NIDDM. There were also significant correlations between SHBG and CBG concentrations on one hand and possible risk factors for the end points studied, such as serum triglycerides, serum cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, body mass, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, smoking habits, and systolic blood pressure, on the other. When these possible confounders, in addition to age, were taken into consideration in multivariate analyses, only the inverse significant correlation between SHBG and NIDDM remained. The increased incidence of diabetes was confined to the lowest quintile of SHBG values, where it was 5-fold higher than in the remaining group. This incidence was further increased to 8- and 11-fold in the lowest 10 and 5% of the values, respectively.

Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly (P less than .001) elevated throughout the day when patients consumed the 60% carbohydrate diet. Fasting plasma total and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations increased by 30% (P less than .001) after 15 days on the 60% carbohydrate diet. Total plasma cholesterol concentrations were similar on both diets, as were low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations."

            "abstract": "A range of risk factors affect cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is increasing evidence that moderate weight loss, expressed as 5-10% weight loss, has beneficial effects on these cardiovascular risk factors. Such moderate weight loss, combined with exercise, significantly decreases triglyceride levels, while significantly increasing levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Studies also indicate that the oxidizability of lipids and lipoproteins in a given individual is of importance in assessing cardiovascular risk. Preliminary data suggest that moderate weight loss can improve the oxidizability status of obese individuals. Lipoprotein (a) levels, however, are not reduced by modest weight reduction, unless pretreatment values are considered. In addition, there is evidence that limited weight loss (< 7 kg) decreases levels of the haemostatic factors, factor VII and PAI, while increasing the tissue plasminogen activator levels. Fibrinogen levels, however, seem not to benefit from such limited weight loss. Modest weight loss has also been found to cause regression of coronary arterial lesions, and significantly reduce cardiac events, total cardiac mortality, and total mortality. Despite the limited success of long-term weight reduction programmes, it seems worthwhile to motivate overweight people to attempt even a modest amount of weight loss, since this may help to reduce cardiovascular risk factors and total mortality."

In addition to ApoB, the analyzed lipoprotein profile included plasma total cholesterol, plasma triglyceride and VLDL-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels. Age, plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and VLDL- and LDL-cholesterol were significantly greater (P less than 0.05) for patients with coronary artery disease than for patients with normal arteries. In contrast, there was no difference in the mean levels of HDL-cholesterol between these 2 groups of patients. However, patients with HDL-cholesterol les than 40 mg/dl had a higher rate of coronary artery disease than those with HDL-cholesterol greater than 40 mg/dl (P less than 0.05). The results of multivariate analysis showed that age and plasma cholesterol were the 2 variables most significantly (P less than 0.01) related to the presence of coronary artery disease. However, in a subgroup of patients with plasma cholesterol less than 265 mg/dl, the most reliable variable was ApoB (P less than 0.01). For patients under 50 years of age ApoB and LDL-cholesterol were the most significant variables (P less than 0.05), whereas for patients at 50 years of age or older VLDL-cholesterol was the most significant variable (P less than 0.01). Results of this study indicate that measurement of ApoB may offer important predictive value for coronary artery disease, especially at lower levels of plasma cholesterol.

            "abstract": "Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione under development for the treatment of NIDDM and potentially other insulin-resistant disease states. Treatment with troglitazone is associated with an improvement in hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin-mediated glucose disposal. No significant side effects have been observed in humans. Because of reported cardiac changes in animals treated with drugs of this class, this multicenter 48-week study was conducted to evaluate whether NIDDM patients treated with troglitazone develop any cardiac mass increase or functional impairment. A total of 154 NIDDM patients were randomized to receive troglitazone 800 mg q.d. or glyburide titrated to achieve glycemic control (< or =20 mg b.i.d. or q.d.). Two-dimensional echocardiography and pulsed Doppler were used to measure left ventricular mass index (LVMI), cardiac index (CI), and stroke volume index (SVI). All echocardiograms were performed at each center (baseline, 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks), recorded on videotape, and forwarded to a blinded central echocardiographic interpreter for analysis. The results showed that LVMI of patients treated with troglitazone was not statistically or clinically different from baseline after 24 or 48 weeks. Statistically significant increases in SVI and CI and a statistically significant decrease in diastolic pressure and estimated peripheral resistance were observed in troglitazone-treated patients. These results were not sex-specific. Glycemic benefits of troglitazone treatment were observed as evidenced by long-term improvement of HbA1c and C-peptide levels. Furthermore, triglycerides were significantly lower, and HDL was significantly higher at weeks 24 and 48. In conclusion, NIDDM patients treated with troglitazone do not show any cardiac mass increase or cardiac function impairment. Conversely, patients on troglitazone benefited from enhanced cardiac output and stroke volume, possibly as a result of decreased peripheral resistance. Treatment with troglitazone appears to have a favorable impact on known cardiovascular risk factors and could potentially lower cardiovascular morbidity in NIDDM patients."

At the baseline examination, physical fitness was measured in terms of lung vital capacity and oxygen uptake during ergometry; early insulin response in terms of the 40-min insulin increment during an oral glucose tolerance test (a correlate of acute insulin response to an intravenous glucose tolerance test), and late insulin response were measured in terms of the 2-h insulin value during the oral glucose tolerance test (a correlate of glucose disposal during euglycaemic clamp testing). Of the subjects studied 116 developed NIDDM (0.4% annually), and when compared with non-diabetic men at baseline, they were found to have an 11% higher mean body mass index (p < 0.001), a higher frequency of family history of diabetes (31 vs 18%, p < 0.001), 16% lower mean physical activity index (p < 0.05), 16% lower mean estimated maximal oxygen uptake (p < 0.001), 10% lower mean vital capacity (p < 0.001), 26% lower 40-min to total insulin response ratio (p < 0.001), and a 2.7 times higher mean 2-h insulin value during an oral glucose tolerance test (p < 0.001). Regression analysis (using Cox's proportional hazards model) showed both low vital capacity, and impaired early insulin response but late hyperinsulinaemia to be independent predictors of NIDDM, in addition to body mass index and fasting blood glucose level (p = 0.05-0.0001). Among subjects with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline (44 of 278 developed NIDDM), fasting glucose level alone predicted diabetes in this model. The findings suggest that in this age group in a Caucasian population, not only does insulin resistance precede glucose intolerance and NIDDM, but also loss of early insulin response indicating impaired beta-cell function to be an early feature of the process culminating in diabetes. As both physical fitness [which correlates inversely with late insulin response (r= -0.42, p < 0.0001)], and the level of physical activity were shown to correlate with diabetes development in this large series, measures to correct these adverse features should be included in future strategies for preventing NIDDM."

However, pharmacological interventions intended to increase HDL-cholesterol have not been consistently associated to an effective CAD risk reduction. Among patients with a myocardial infarction, 43 and 44% of men and women, respectively, had normal plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol, whereas genetic studies have failed to show a causal association between HDL-cholesterol and CAD risk. Instead, HDL functionality seems to be the target to be evaluated, but the existing methods are still poorly reproducible and far to be adapted to the clinical laboratory. HDL subclasses rise as a potential alternative for the evaluation of CAD risk; HDL subclasses are a surrogate of intravascular metabolism of these lipoproteins and probably of their functionality. Low levels of large HDL and increased proportions of small particles are the most remarkable features associated to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or CAD. However, inflammation and other environmental factors are related with abnormal HDL structure, and, as a consequence, more prospective studies are needed to better support the clinical usefulness of HDL subclasses.

This study was, therefore, undertaken to compare well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease in a group of 53 men (n=34) and women (n=19) in the town of Gombe who had suffered a stroke or heart attack with the corresponding parameters in 48 age- and gender-matched healthy adults living in the same environment. The parameters of cardiovascular diseases considered were: overweight and obesity, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and homocysteine. While the male and female patients who had suffered stroke (n=48) or heart attack (n=5) were borderline hypertensive, their mean body mass index values were not different from the corresponding values of their control groups. Although the serum homocysteine levels of the patients and controls were not significantly different, 85% of the stroke patients had serum homocysteine levels greater than 10 microM. These high homocysteine levels could not be accounted for by sub-optimal folate or vitamin B 12 status. The serum levels of HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride were not significantly different between the male and female patients and their respective controls. However, the males, but not the females, with macrovascular disease had significantly higher levels of total cholesterol (161 vs 137 mg/dL, p=0.04) and LDL-cholesterol (91 vs 70 mg/dL, p=0.02). In addition, both female and male stroke/myocardial infarction patients exhibited an elevated LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio.

            "abstract": "Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a central role in triglyceride metabolism, and the LPL gene T495G HindIII polymorphism has been associated with variations in lipid levels and heart disease in Caucasians with the more common H+ allele being associated with adverse lipid profiles and increased risk of CHD. We investigated this polymorphism in 785 Chinese subjects with varying components of the metabolic syndrome, including 61.4% with early-onset type 2 diabetes (age at diagnosis < or = 40 years), and 167 healthy control subjects using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. The allele and genotype frequencies were similar in the patients and control subjects. When grouped above or below standard cutoffs for triglyceride levels, the H+ allele was more frequent in hypertriglyceridemic than that in normotriglyceridemic subjects in the total population (81.5% v 76.1%) and early-onset type 2 diabetics (84.4% v 77.4%, both P <.05). Moreover, H+H+ carriers had significantly higher plasma triglyceride and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels when compared to subjects with the H- allele in the total population, and in patients with early-onset diabetics (both P <.05). In the total population and the early-onset diabetic patients, this relationship was confined to males when gender was considered. We conclude that the H+ allele of the LPL gene HindIII polymorphism is associated with higher plasma triglyceride and lower HDL-cholesterol levels in Chinese patients with early-onset diabetes."

The rates of hospital morbidity situated them as the 3rd cause of hospital admissions. Because of its part in the production of atherosclerosis and its associations with ischaemic heart disease, the hypercholesterolemia is one of the necessary factors to be controlled in populations, in order to reduce mortality by coronary disease. Therefore, it becomes necessary to know the magnitude and prevalence of serum cholesterol and lipoproteins in our community, for there exist no published data on the matter and as a previous step to the introduction of intervention programmes.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      An observational transversal study, stratified by blood pressure and municipalities, in a population of 30 years or more, is carried out. The size of the sample is 1060 persons; out of them 548 persons are hypertensive and 512 normotensive; these are taken as control group. In this populations, analytic tests are made to know the total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and Triglyceride levels.

            "abstract": "Lipid abnormalities in diabetic patients are likely to play an important role in the development of atherogenesis. These lipid disorders include not only quantitative but also qualitative abnormalities of lipoproteins which are potentially atherogenic. Both types are present in non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) and poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM), whereas only qualitative abnormalities are observed in well- and moderately well-controlled IDDM. The main quantitative abnormalities are increased triglyceride levels related to elevated VLDL and IDL and decreased HDL-cholesterol levels due to a drop in the HDL2 subfraction. The increase of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in plasma is related to higher VLDL production by the liver and a decrease in their clearance. Metabolic abnormalities of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are more pronounced in the postprandial period. The decrease in HDL-cholesterol is related to increased HDL catabolism. Qualitative abnormalities include changes in lipoprotein size (large VLDL, small LDL), increase of triglyceride content of LDL and HDL, glycation of apolipoproteins, and increased susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. These qualitative abnormalities impair the normal metabolism of lipoproteins and could thus promote atherogenesis. The physiopathology of lipid disorders in diabetes mellitus is multifactorial and still imperfectly known. However, such factors as hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance (in NIDDM) are likely to play an important role."

Studies were performed in 37 morbidly obese patients divided into three groups: group I--without coexisting diseases, group II--with arterial hypertension, and group III--with arterial hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. In all groups there was an increase in TG concentration, a decrease in HDL-cholesterol level, and normal values of TC and LDL-cholesterol. The concentrations of 7-hydroxycholesterols (7-OH) in group II (602.65 +/- 264.46 ng/ml) and group III (570.94 +/- 210.59 ng/ml) were significantly higher compared to that in group I (336.09 +/- 220.74 ng/ml).

Moreover, the positive correlation between TG and HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and negative correlation between plasma vitamin E and 7-K concentrations were demonstrated. In conclusion, although the study demonstrates similar disturbances in lipid profile and oxidation stress parameters in all groups, with significant differences in 7-OH only, the role of cholesterol oxidation products in pathogenesis of arterial hypertension and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in morbidly obese patients cannot be excluded."

Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol showed a tendency to be higher in CAD patients than in CAD-free subjects (216 vs. 205 mg/dl, P = 0.07). HDL-cholesterol showed a tendency towards lower values in CAD patients compared to CAD-free subjects 35 vs. 41 mg/dl, P = 0.07). In univariate analysis the severity of CAD correlated with (i) complex, apolipoprotein (apo) B containing particles (Lp-B-complex, r = 0.31, P = 0.005), (ii) HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.30, P = 0.005), (iii) apoC-III in heparin precipitate (r = 0.30, P = 0.005) and (iv) plasma triglycerides (r = 0.25, P = 0.02), all of which are related to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. A comparison between the two subspecies of complex lipoprotein particles revealed that those containing apolipoproteins B, C-III and E (Lp-B:C:E complex) were more closely associated with CAD score (r = 0.27, P = 0.01) than those containing apolipoproteins A-II, B, C, D and E (Lp-A-II:B-complex).

In most studies, the duration of diabetes and severity of glycemia are only weakly related to CHD in NIDDM, suggesting that the prediabetic period may be important for the increased CHD in NIDDM subjects. Both hyperinsulinemia and/or insulin resistance predict the development of NIDDM. A number of studies have shown that increased cardiovascular risk factors (especially high triglyceride, blood pressure, and small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and low high-density liproprotein (HDL) cholesterol) precede the onset of NIDDM. Recent data from the San Antonio Heart Study suggest that the atherogenic pattern of cardiovascular risk factors is more marked in prediabetic women than in prediabetic men, thus partially explaining the higher risk of CHD in prediabetic women than in prediabetic men. The atherogenic changes in cardiovascular risk factors appear to be mainly due to increased hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in nondiabetic subjects. Interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease in NIDDM subjects should emphasize the primary prevention of NIDDM and very aggressive treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in prediabetic subjects. Treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia in high-risk patients for NIDDM should avoid agents that further worsen insulin resistance (nicotinic acid, beta blockers, and thiazides), as subjects with hypertension and dyslipidemia are already at increased risk of NIDDM."

            "abstract": "The influence of a beet-fibre enriched diet (mean 40 g FibrexR, 27 g dietary fibre per day) on blood pressure, plasma lipoproteins and glycaemic control was studied in 12 non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDD) patients. The effect on gastrointestinal hormones was also investigated. Beet-fibre and control diets were given in randomized order for 8 weeks each. During the beet-fibre diet the systolic blood pressure decreased (P less than 0.05) and the HDL-cholesterol levels increased (P less than 0.05) compared to values before the study. There was a tendency for systolic blood pressure to be lower also in the control period, but this was not statistically significant. After both diet periods the total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels decreased, as well as the LDL/HDL ratio. Blood glucose levels--fasting or postprandial--and glycosylated haemoglobin were not affected during the two different diet periods. In obese NIDD patients, however, the postprandial insulin levels were lower after the beet-fibre diet compared to the control diet. This subgroup also showed lower fasting values of pancreatic polypeptide and motilin were recorded for the obese patients after the fibre-rich period compared to before the study. Further, increases in postprandial motilin levels, 60-180 min, were found after the fibre-rich period. Investigations with reference to an entero-hormonal mechanism by measuring neurotensin and peptide YY did not show any variations between the diet periods."

A practical approach is the specific precipitation of apo-B-containing lipoproteins (atherogenic lipoproteins) by Concanavalin A (Con. A), a lectin with high affinity for glycoprotein apo-B. Specificity was assessed by radial immunodiffusion of apoprotein B in whole serum and in Con. A supernates. Double-immunodiffusion of isolated LP-fractions against anti-apo-B and Con. A demonstrated immunochemical identity of Con. A precipitable LP with apo-B-containing LP. Con. A precipitated cholesterol in the d : 1.063-1.21 g/ml fraction when apo-B was present. Complete precipitation of low density cholesterol was demonstrated, using a reconstituted serum sample radiolabelled in the d less than 1.063 g/ml fraction. Treatment of a reconstituted serum sample containing radiolabelled 125I-apo-A-I with Con. A demonstrated precipitation of trace amounts only of apo A-I. Con. A precipitated LP-B cholesterol quantitatively even when serum triglycerides (TG) exceeded 37.7 mmol/l. Clinical application of this method revealed that 73% of the patient population demonstrated apo-B in the d greater than 1.063 g/ml fraction."

Compared to all other diabetic men, those who died of ischemic heart disease were older, had higher levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) total plasma cholesterol, and triglycerides, lower HDL-C levels, and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and were more likely to have been cigarette smokers; only total cholesterol, LDL-C, and the LDL/HDL ratio were statistically significant. Age, FPG, total plasma cholesterol, and LDL-C were all independently predictive of fatal heart disease by multivariate analysis. Neither HDL-C nor the LDL/HDL ratio predicted ischemic heart disease death better than the total plasma cholesterol or LDL-C. The use of HDL-C, LDL-C, or total plasma cholesterol level in the model did not eliminate the significant association with FPG, which suggests that the noxious effect of hyperglycemia is independent of the changes in blood lipids."

            "abstract": "Apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV) is a major component of several lipoprotein particles and may, therefore, play an important role in lipid metabolism. Genetic polymorphism of apo A-IV has been reported in humans and several other animal species. The presence of two common alleles, apo A-IV * 1 and apo A-IV * 2 has been documented in several human populations. In this investigation, we have determined apo A-IV polymorphism by isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting in 82 non-insulin-dependent diabetic and 204 control non-Hispanic Whites from the San Luis Valley, Colorado. We have also estimated the impact of apo A-IV polymorphism on eight quantitative traits: total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, HDL3 and HDL2-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and fasting insulin. No statistically significant difference was seen in apo A-IV allele frequencies between the control and diabetics, and these frequencies were comparable with those reported for U.S. White and European populations. Among controls, the impact of the apo A-IV polymorphism was significant on LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.04) in females and on fasting insulin levels (P = 0.06) in males. In diabetics, the effect was significant on insulin (P = 0.03) levels in males only. Furthermore, our data suggest that when making comparison of lipid profiles between the controls and diabetics the presence or absence of common apo A-IV phenotypes should be taken into account as these appear to effect these comparisons."

            "abstract": "Niacin has been widely used as a pharmacologic agent to regulate abnormalities in plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism and in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although the use of niacin in the treatment of dyslipidemia has been reported as early as 1955, only recent studies have yielded an understanding about the cellular and molecular mechanism of action of niacin on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. In brief, the beneficial effect of niacin to reduce triglycerides and apolipoprotein-B containing lipoproteins (e.g., VLDL and LDL) are mainly through: a) decreasing fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue triglyceride stores, and b) inhibiting hepatocyte diacylglycerol acyltransferase and triglyceride synthesis leading to increased intracellular apo B degradation and subsequent decreased secretion of VLDL and LDL particles. The mechanism of action of niacin to raise HDL is by decreasing the fractional catabolic rate of HDL-apo AI without affecting the synthetic rates. Additionally, niacin selectively increases the plasma levels of Lp-AI (HDL subfraction without apo AII), a cardioprotective subfraction of HDL in patients with low HDL. Using human hepatocytes (Hep G2 cells) as an in vitro model system, recent studies indicate that niacin selectively inhibits the uptake/removal of HDL-apo AI (but not HDL-cholesterol ester) by hepatocytes, thereby increasing the capacity of retained HDL-apo AI to augment cholesterol efflux through reverse cholesterol transport pathway. The studies discussed in this review provide evidence to extend the role of niacin as a lipid-lowering drug beyond its role as a vitamin."

Diabetes was diagnosed by WHO criteria and highly specific, monoclonal antibody-based assays were used to measure insulin, intact proinsulin, and des 31,32 proinsulin. Subjects with NIDDM were significantly more obese, had more central distribution of obesity, higher fasting plasma specific insulin concentrations (NIDDM median 74 pmol l-1 vs IGT 41 pmol l-1, p < 0.01 and vs normals 34 pmol l-1, p < 0.001) and higher PAI-1 activity than normals and those with IGT (NIDDM 23.0 +/- 6.9 vs IGT 16.8 +/- 5.0, p < 0.001 and vs normals 17.1 +/- 6.9 AU ml-1, p < 0.001). However, PAI-1 activity was not significantly different between Asian and Caucasian normals (17.5 +/- 7.3 vs 16.5 +/- 6.4 AU ml-1, p = ns) and diabetic (22.8 +/- 7.3 vs 23.1 +/- 6.6 AU ml-1, p = ns) subjects. In addition to relationships with obesity and plasma triglyceride, PAI-1 activity, after controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and waist-hip ratio, was related to fasting insulin (partial r = 0.22, p < 0.001), intact proinsulin (partial r = 0.36, p < 0.001), and des 31,32 proinsulin concentrations (partial r = 0.33, p < 0.001) as measured by highly specific assays.

We conclude that, although PAI-1 activity is raised in subjects with diet-treated NIDDM, it is normal in subjects with IGT and non-diabetic Asians, populations at high risk of NIDDM and ischaemic heart disease. Raised PAI-1 activity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of macrovascular disease in subjects with NIDDM, but is unlikely to explain excess risk of ischaemic heart disease in Asians and those with impaired glucose tolerance."

Increased physical activity delays the onset of non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) or even prevents the disease in about 50% of susceptible individuals (positive family history of NIDDM, body-mass index > 25, hypertension or gestational diabetes). Regular exercise has been shown to lower plasma triglyceride and to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Exercise has also beneficial effects on hypertension, body composition and fat distribution. Improved glucose tolerance has been achieved in type II diabetic patients in as little as one week with an exercise program. The beneficial effect of regular exercise on glucose control appears to reflect the cumulative effect of transient improvement in glucose tolerance following each individual bout of exercise. Increased insulin sensitivity is lost after as little as three days of inactivity. Most studies suggest that the maximum benefit from exercise is most likely to occur in patients with mild diabetes in whom insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are present (i.e. patients with fasting blood glucose of < 11 mM). The recommended frequency and duration of exercise is three times per week or every other day and, as adjunct for weight reduction, five to seven times per week for 30 to 45 min. at an intensity of 50 to 70% VO2max (or 60 to 80% of maximal the heart rate). Because of the high incidence of ischemic heart disease in type II diabetic patients, patients older than 35 years of age should undergo a graded exercise stress electrocardiogram. Attention should be paid to foot-care and the use of appropriate footwear and diabetic late complications, such as autonomic and peripheral neuropathy. Older obese NIDDM patients can achieve significant metabolic benefits from low-intensity programs, such as daily walking, which can be easily incorporated into daily living. Taking the necessary precautions, most patients with diabetes can take part in a monitored exercise program safely."

Despite the improvement observed in recent years, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality of diabetics are cardiovascular diseases. The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus constitutes such a high risk as the known presence of vascular disease. Diabetic dyslipidaemia is characterised by high fasting and postprandial triglyceride levels, low HDL level, and slightly elevated LDL-cholesterol with domination of atherogenic small dense LDL. These are not independent components of the atherogenic dyslipidaemia, but are closely linked to each other. Beside the known harmful effects of low HDL and small dense LDL, recent findings confirmed the atherogenicity of the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants. It has been shown that the key of this process is the overproduction and delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the liver. In this metabolism the lipoprotein lipase has a determining role; its function is accelerated by ApoA5 and attenuated by ApoC3. The null mutations of the ApoC3 results in a reduced risk of myocardial infarction, the loss-of-function mutation of ApoA5 was associated with a 60% elevation of triglyceride level and 2.2-times increased risk of myocardial infarction. In case of diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, obesity, metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease the non-HDL-cholesterol is a better marker of the risk than the LDL-cholesterol. Its value can be calculated by subtraction of HDL-cholesterol from total cholesterol. Target values of non-HDL-cholesterol can be obtained by adding 0.8 mmol/L to the LDL-cholesterol targets (this means 3.3 mmol/L in high, and 2.6 mmol/L in very high risk patients). The drugs of first choice in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidaemia are statins. Nevertheless, it is known that even if statin therapy is optimal (treated to target), a considerable residual (lipid) risk remains. For its reduction treatment of low HDL-cholesterol and high triglyceride levels is obvious by the administration of fibrates. In addition to statin therapy, fenofibrate can be recommended."

We therefore compared plasma PHF activity in NIDDM patients and nondiabetic control subjects using a rat bioassay. More NIDDM patients (65%) than non-diabetic controls (33.3%) had detectable PHF activity. When injected into rats, plasma of 185 NIDDM patients caused an average increase of 4.89 +/- 0.68 mm Hg in rat mean arterial pressure (MAP). This change was significantly greater than a slight drop of 0.42 +/- 0.96 mm Hg (mean +/- SE) for the 127 nondiabetic control subjects (Student's t test, p < 0.001). A higher percentage of the NIDDM patients than of the non-diabetic patients were hypertensive. However, a stratified analysis showed that diabetic patients consistently had significantly higher PHF levels than did nondiabetic patients, regardless of being hypertensive or not. PHF activity did not correlate with age, sex, body mass index, or the type of hypoglycemic agent taken. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a positive correlation between cholesterol and PHF level among the diabetic patients (p = 0.03), but such a correlation did not exist among the non-diabetic controls. Our data indicate that elevated PHF may be responsible for insulin resistance in a fraction of NIDDM patients and suggest that PHF may be related to serum cholesterol levels in NIDDM."

            "abstract": "The effect of 20 mg of enalapril with and without 12.5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide on glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity and lipids was evaluated in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Ten mild to moderate hypertensive patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were treated for 8 weeks with 20 mg enalapril once a day, and then divided into two groups of 5 patients each for a second 8 weeks of treatment with enalapril alone or in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg once a day. Blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, lipids and insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, and insulin sensitivity were measured at baseline and after 8 and 16 weeks. Results were analyzed by the ANOVA test for repeated measures and all values are given as mean +/- SD. Diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly after the first and second period of enalapril and after the combination of enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. Glycosylated hemoglobin dropped significantly after the first and second period of enalapril monotherapy. Plasma triglycerides and fasting plasma insulin decreased significantly after the 16 weeks of enalapril. Insulin-mediated glucose uptake increased significantly after 8 and 16 weeks of monotherapy with enalapril. No significant difference was observed in any of the metabolic characteristics, including insulin sensitivity, between the values after 8 weeks of enalapril alone and the final values of the enalapril-treated and the enalapril/hydrochlorothiazide-treated groups. It is concluded that enalapril improves some of the metabolic parameters, including insulin sensitivity, of hypertensive diabetic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The effects on blood pressure, glucose and lipid metabolism were examined. Daily administration of 20 to 60 mg amosulalol caused a significant reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure within 2 weeks. This effect was stable, lasting for the entire trial period. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased from 174 +/- 13/92 +/- 9 mmHg at the beginning to 148 +/- 16/80 +/- 11 mmHg at the end of the trial. Heart rate was not affected. Plasma glucose and haemoglobin Alc levels showed a tendency to decrease without any statistical significance. Total and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels also remained unchanged. Although 3 patients had complained of dizziness, all were easily manageable. The results indicate that amosulalol is effective in the treatment of hypertension in non-insulin dependent diabetics and does not affect glucose and lipid metabolism."

            "abstract": "The analysis of serum lipoprotein was performed in school children in suburban areas in Japan. Serum lipid levels and lipoprotein profiles of obese children were compared to those of controls with normal body weight. Obese children with body weight more than 20 per cent above ideal body weight comprised approximately 6 per cent of the children. There was little difference in concentration of total cholesterol and triglycerides between the obese and the non-obese children. However, in obese children, the level of HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower and the level of (VLDL + LDL)-cholesterol was higher, so that the ratio of (VLDL + LDL)-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol was substantially higher than in non-obese children. In the obese children, a linear correlation was obtained between total serum cholesterol and the ratio of (VLDL + LDL)-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol level, which showed the increase of HDL-cholesterol was not accompanied with the increase of total cholesterol, while in the non-obese children, total serum cholesterol was not parallel with the ratio of (VLDL + LDL)-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol level, suggesting a co-increase of HDL-cholesterol with LDL-cholesterol. As the changes in lipoprotein profiles characterized by the increase in LDL and the decrease in HDL is one of the major risk factors of atherosclerosis, the prevention of obesity during school life seems to be important to prevent atherosclerotic diseases even in normolipidemic children."

Concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) E, apo C-II, triglyceride (TG), retinyl palmitate, and cholesterol were measured in fasting plasma and in plasma obtained after 2, 4, 6, 9, and 24 h after a meal containing 78 g of fat and 345,000 IU of vitamin A. The same measurements were carried out in the lipoprotein fractions with Svedberg flotation rates Sf 400-1100, 60-400, 20-60 and 12-20, obtained by density gradient ultracentrifugation. The postprandial apo E concentrations were highest in group 1 (NIDDM and CAD) in plasma and in the TG-rich lipoprotein fractions, with significant differences in comparison with the healthy subjects. As shown by apo E to TG ratios, the postprandial lipoproteins were enriched with apo E in the patients with NIDDM and CAD. The largest excesses of apo E in group 1 patients were observed in the atherogenic Sf 12-60 lipoproteins. Across the entire study population, there was a significant inverse correlation between the postprandial apo E responses and the postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity. The results suggest that enrichment of the remnant lipoproteins with apo E may have a role in the increased risk of CAD among patients with NIDDM."

Concentrations of apoA-I were lower in those eating the least cholesterol and the highest P/S ratio, ie, apoA-I correlated positively with dietary cholesterol (r = 0.38, P less than 0.05), and both apoA-I and the A-I and the A-I/A-II ratio correlated negatively with the ratio of polyunsaturated-to-saturated (P/S) fatty acids (r = -0.39, P less than 0.05, and r = -0.41, P less than 0.02, respectively). There was no significant correlation between apoA-I, apoA-II, the A-I/A-II ratio or the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol/apoA-I ratio and consumption of total calories, fat, protein, or carbohydrate. Since the A-I/A-II ratio is much higher in HDL2 than in HDL3, these data suggest that cholesterol intake and the P/S ratio are important long-term dietary determinants of plasma HDL2 levels. Thus, in vegetarians, despite a reduced risk of coronary heart disease, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and especially HDL2 concentrations were low.

Body weight, plasma lipids, blood pressure, and body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. Secondary measures included insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment, HOMA-IR), oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS), and predicted insulin sensitivity (PREDIM) indices. Thereafter, participants were asked to return to their baseline diets for 4 weeks, after which they began the opposite diet for 16 weeks. The same parameters were measured before and after this 2nd 16-week period.Results: Overall net weight changes were 0.0 (Mediterranean) and -6.0 kg (vegan), (treatment effect -6.0 kg [95% CI -7.5 to -4.5]; p < 0.001). HOMA-IR decreased and OGIS increased on the vegan diet with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -0.7 [95% CI, -1.8 to +0.4]; p = 0.21; and +35.8 mL/min/m2 [95% CI, +13.2 to +58.3]; p = 0.003, respectively). PREDIM did not change significantly in either group. Among participants with no medication changes, total and LDL-cholesterol decreased 18.7 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L) and 15.3 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/L), respectively, on the vegan diet, compared with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect -15.6 [-24.6 to -6.6]; p = 0.001 and -14.8 [-23.5 to -6.2]; p = 0.001, respectively); systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 9.3 and 7.3 mmHg on the Mediterranean diet, compared with 3.4 and 4.1 mmHg on the vegan diet (treatment effect +5.9 [95% CI +1.0 to +10.9]; p = 0.02; and +1.8 [95% CI -4.6 to +8.1]; p = 0.58, respectively).Conclusions: A low-fat vegan diet improved body weight, lipid concentrations, and insulin sensitivity, both from baseline and compared with a Mediterranean diet. Blood pressure decreased on both diets, more on the Mediterranean diet.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03698955 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03698955?term=NCT03698955&draw=2&rank=1."

The study was performed on 59 Chinese males, in whom 31 were patients with thrombotic stroke affecting the cerebral cortex diagnosed by neurological examination and computed tomography; and the others grouped as healthy control. The age and Broca index of both groups were similar. The serum levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were normal. However, in the thrombotic stroke group HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower and correlated inversely with both significantly higher levels of VLDL-cholesterol (r=-0.5392, p less than 0.01) and VLDL-triglyceride (r=-0.5866, p less than 0.01). The serum levels of total triglycerides and LDL-triglyceride were also significantly higher in patient with thrombotic stroke. The mean area percentage of HDL2b subfraction measured in the diameter range as determined by gradient gel electrophoresis was significantly lower and HDL2 also showed the same tendency in patients with thrombotic stroke. Our finding was consistent with the postulation that HDL2 or HDL2b in in particular, probably played a more protective role than any other HDL subfractions against thrombotic stroke, one of the major atherosclerotic complications."

            "abstract": "Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) is a lipid transfer protein that is required for the assembly and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by the liver and chylomicrons by the intestine. The common G-493T polymorphism of the MTP promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol and ApoB content of VLDL. The purpose of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the association of this mutation with variations in lipid and apoprotein levels, lipoprotein subclass profiles and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a population-based sample of 1226 male and 1284 female Framingham Offspring participants. In men and women, no significant association was found between the G-493T MTP polymorphism and variations of plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apoprotein B, HDL-cholesterol, apoprotein AI and triglycerides. In order to further investigate potential relationships with variations of lipoprotein phenotypes, lipoprotein subclass profiles were measured using automated nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Each NMR profile yielded information on lipid mass of VLDL, LDL, and HDL subclasses. In both genders, there was no significant association between the G-493T polymorphism and variability of lipoprotein subclass distributions or lipoprotein particle size. Furthermore, no significant association was found between the polymorphism of the MTP promoter and prevalence or the age of onset of CHD. Thus, our results suggest that the G-493T mutation in the MTP promoter is unlikely to have significant implications for cardiovascular disease in men and women."

            "abstract": "The effects of chlorthalidone and metoprolol on fasting plasma lipids and lipoprotein levels were compared in two similar nonrandomized groups of patients with mild hypertension. Chlorthalidone therapy was associated with an increase in serum cholesterol of 8.1% (17 mg/dl), mainly reflecting an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. High-density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol decreased, but the difference between pre- and posttreatment levels did not reach statistical significance. Serum triglyceride (TG) concentration increased by 16% (20 mg/dl). Metoprolol therapy was not associated with changes in total, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels. Serum TG concentration increased by 22% (28 mg/dl), mainly due to an increase in VLDL-TG. Application of the Israel Ischemic Heart Disease Study data to these findings could predict only a very slight decrease in the 5-year estimated probability of myocardial infarction in the chlorthalidone-treated group. Metoprolol therapy has, theoretically, a more favorable influence on coronary heart disease risk status. These data suggest that the different forms of therapy for mild hypertension have a different effect on the theoretical coronary heart disease risk status, a fact that should be taken into consideration in the choice of medication."

However, despite the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, a significant residual risk has been observed even after reaching the LDL-C target, suggesting that other risk factors beyond LDL-C should be addressed, including low levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). Several clinical trials have shown an inverse relationship between HDL-C levels and cardiovascular risk, and 1 mg/dl increment in HDL-C is associated in epidemiological studies with a 2-3% decrease in cardiovascular risk, suggesting that raising HDL-C levels might have beneficial effects to reduce cardiovascular disease. However, several lines of evidence indicate that the functional properties of HDL may be relevant as well. In patient with CAD and normal HDL-C levels, HDL exhibit significantly reduced protective functions, and rather appear to be pro-atherogenic; on the other hand some genetic mutations causing low levels of HDL-C are not associated with increased atherosclerosis. Furthermore, although niacin significantly increased HDL-C levels, no further clinical benefit was observed from the addition of niacin to statin therapy, suggesting that increasing HDL-C levels is not sufficient and perhaps functional properties of HDL must be considered when choosing a therapeutic strategy to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk."

There were 1144 Japanese-Americans aged 40 years or more (mean (+/- SD) age: 60.7 +/- 10.1) available for follow-up, and who were non-diabetic based on glucose tolerance test (GTT) results conducted at the time of the initial examination. During the study period (6.3 +/- 3.2 yr), 124 cases of NIDDM occurred with an incidence rate as high as 10.8% or 17.2 persons per 1000 person-years. The incidence of NIDDM was 1.25 times higher in males than in females, and the rate increased with age. The incidence in obese people (body mass index: BMI > or = 25) was approximately twice that in the non-obese, the rate increasing with the level of obesity. Using Cox's proportional hazards model, the risk factors for NIDDM were analysed after adjusting for sex and age. Significant risk factors were the serum glucose (SG) level (fasting, 1-h, 2-h), the serum immuno-reactive insulin (IRI) level (1-h, 2-h) during GTT, BMI, serum triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, serum uric acid, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, serum total protein, and delta IRI/delta SG (0-30 min) level. In particular the hyperinsulinaemia was a significant risk factor even after adjusting for sex, age, and obesity. The incidence of NIDDM in the sub-group whose delta IRI/delta SG (0-30 min) level was under 0.3 was higher than that of the over 0.8 sub-group by a factor of approximately 12. Likewise, after dividing the subjects into five sub-groups according to the fasting or 2 h IRI level, the incidence of NIDDM was higher in the highest quintile than in the lowest quintile sub-group by a factor of approximately 3 and 7, respectively. The results of the GTT of the subjects who developed NIDDM during the follow-up period were analysed longitudinally and compared with the results obtained 8 years before occurrence of NIDDM. An increase in the 2-h serum IRI was observed initially, followed by an increase in the 2-h serum glucose level, preceding the appearance of NIDDM.\n    \n\n\n          In conclusion:\n        \n      \n      1. A high incidence of NIDDM is clearly observed in the population of Japanese-Americans, who are genetically indistinguishable from native Japanese; causes of this increase, from the survey results, are suspected to include westernization of lifestyle, particularly the reduction in the level of physical activity, conversion to a diet containing markedly more animal fat, simple carbohydrates, and less complex carbohydrates. 2. In the Japanese-Americans, diminished early insulin release to an oral glucose challenge and increased insulin resistance characterized by hyperinsulinaemia are suspected to be some of the important risk factors for NIDDM. Consequently, this study strongly suggested the possibility that the development of NIDDM in Japanese persons may be influenced by environmental factors."

In the population studied we did not find any association between total, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol and ABO blood groups while triglyceride levels were higher in individuals with B antigen (B + AB) than in subjects without this antigen. We think that environmental factors could be more important than genetic factors in the arousal of cardiovascular diseases."

One thousand one hundred thirty-nine newly diagnosed middle-aged (30- to 55-yr-old) patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) entered the study. They were classified as diet controlled after a 6-wk screening phase with conventional dietary treatment. During the follow-up, the control group (n = 378) was cared for at different diabetes outpatient clinics with a standardized surveillance. The intervention group (n = 761) had a structured IHE that included dietary advice, antismoking and antialcohol education, and ways to enhance physical activity.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Randomly, 379 of the IHE patients received 1.6 g clofibric acid/day, and the others received placebo. IHE resulted in improved glucose control (adjusted fasting blood glucose) levels after 5 yr (control subjects 9.27 mM, IHE group 8.71 mM, and IHE plus clofibric acid group 8.60 mM, P less than 0.01). The better glycemic control was achieved with fewer antidiabetic drugs. After 5 yr, antidiabetic drugs were prescribed to 47% of the control subjects, 28% of the IHE group, and 34% of the IHE plus clofibric acid group (cutoff limit for drug application was postprandial blood glucose of greater than or equal to 13.87 mM). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (0.26 vs. 0.40, P less than 0.01) and physical activity (174 vs. 327 scores, P less than 0.01) were increased, and blood pressure, tobacco, and alcohol consumption were significantly reduced by IHE. However, IHE had no effect on calorie intake, percentage of fat in the diet (45%), and body weight. The most important finding was the significant increase of blood cholesterol in all three groups (+0.47, +0.36, and +0.34 mM, respectively). Clofibric acid only prevented the increase of triglyceride levels (+0.56, +0.24, and +0.05 mM, respectively). The incidence rate per 1000 for myocardial infarction was 30.3 for control subjects, 53.6 for the IHE group, and 55.6 for the IHE plus clofibric acid group. The corresponding rates for IHD incidence were 90.9, 97.8, and 98.8, respectively. Men suffered more frequently from myocardial infarction, whereas women developed ECG criteria for IHD more frequently. Among the 35 cases of death, besides cardiovascular diseases, liver cirrhosis and neoplasia were the predominant causes. The death rate per 1000 in control subjects was 46.2, 30.6 in the IHE group, and 27 among patients with IHE plus clofibric acid.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      IHE was of substantial benefit for the control of glycemia, significantly diminished the need for antidiabetic drugs, and reduced a cluster of risk factors but had no effect on the control of blood lipids. This could be one major reason for the failure of IHE, effective lowering of blood pressure, and clofibric acid to prevent cardiovascular complications. Clofibric acid was only effective in reducing triglycerides."

The mean plasma alpha-tocopherol and (LDL + VLDL)-alpha-tocopherol levels increased significantly in the diabetic group as compared to control (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.02), whereas the high density lipoprotein (HDL)-alpha-tocopherol level was significantly lower in the diabetic group than that in the controls (P less than 0.05). Correlations between plasma alpha-tocopherol levels showed close positive relationships (r = 0.87, r = 0.75 and r = 0.78, respectively, P less than 0.001). A strong positive correlation was also observed between alpha-tocopherol and the cholesterol content, either in the HDL or in the (LDL + VLDL) fractions (r = 0.75 and r = 0.77; P less than 0.001). These findings indicate that there is a direct positive relationship between lipid and alpha-tocopherol concentrations. The increased level of alpha-tocopherol in the LDL + VLDL fraction and decreased level in HDL in these patients could be attributed to the impairment of the cholesterol uptake of the cells by the receptor mediated mechanism."

            "abstract": "Obesity is frequently associated with high plasma triglyceride and reduced plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and an increased concentration of apoB-carrying lipoproteins. The effects of obesity on lipid metabolism are mainly mediated by insulin resistance and, as central (visceral) obesity significantly increases insulin resistance, it aggravates these lipid changes. We have reviewed the impact of obesity on lipid metabolism in different types of primary hyperlipidemias. Obesity is not common in primary (familial and polygenic) hypercholesterolemias, and insulin resistance is infrequent; various investigators have found no or only a weak association between plasma cholesterol concentrations and insulin levels. On the other hand, in familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV) and familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH), obesity and insulin resistance are common and, when present, contribute to a further deterioration in the lipid profile. Weight loss in most of these patients is accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma triglyceride levels and an increase in HDL-C. Reviewing the data published by our group, we show that insulin resistance is an important component of the metabolic derangement in FCH subjects; high fasting plasma free fatty acids and triglycerides levels correlate to insulin resistance, thus linking this abnormality to lipid metabolism. A high waist/hip ratio (indicating visceral fat deposits) exacerbates insulin resistance, but this is also present in lean FCH subjects. Furthermore, insulin resistance is associated with a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease in this group of subjects."

Eight percent of patients with normoalbuminuria, 20% of patients with microalbuminuria, and 35% of patients with macroalbuminuria had died, predominantly from cardiovascular disease. Significant predictors of all-cause mortality included preexisting coronary heart disease, AER, HbA1c level and age. Significant predictors of cardiovascular mortality included preexisting coronary heart disease, macroalbuminuria, HbA1c level and systolic blood pressure. Abnormally elevated urinary albumin excretion and poor glycaemic control indicate a substantially increased all-cause, mainly cardiovascular, mortality risk in NIDDM patients."

The different components of diabetic complications are not independent but rather interdependent of each other, rendering the disease difficult to diagnose and control. The underlying pathogenesis of those components cannot be easily elucidated because of the heterogeneous, polygenic, and multifactorial nature of the disease. Metabonomics offers a snapshot of distinct biochemical variations that may reflect the unique metabolic phenotype under pathophysiological conditions. Here we report a mass-spectrometry-based metabonomic study designed to identify the distinct metabolic changes associated with several complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The 292 patients recruited in the study were divided into five groups, including T2DM with HBP, T2DM with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), T2DM with HBP and NAFLD, T2DM with HBP and coronary heart disease (CHD), and T2DM with HBP, NAFLD, and CHD. Serum differential metabolites were identified in each group of T2DM complication, mainly involving bile acid, fatty acid, amino acid, lipid, carbohydrate, steroids metabolism, and tricarboxylic acids cycle. These broad-spectrum metabolic changes emphasize the complex abnormalities present among these complications with elevated blood glucose levels, providing a novel strategy for stratifying patients with T2DM complications using blood-based metabolite markers."

            "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have elucidated that diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the risk factors of coronary heart disease and that DM often accompanies dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia in DM can be classified as either quantitative or qualitative. Although dyslipdemia in DM is affected by the type of DM and glycemic conditions, the characteristics of dyslipidemia in DM, especially in NIDDM are the increase in triglycerides accompanied by the decrease in HDL-cholesterol level. Recently, new commercial kits for measurement of atherogenic lipoproteins which increase in DM are clinically available. The usefulness of these kits in DM was reviewed. Polyacrylamide electrophoresis can detect IDL and Lp(a) qualitatively. It has also become possible to estimate Lp(a) quantitatively by ELISA, TIA and LIA methods. Remnant lipoprotein can be measured in the fraction unbound to anti-apo A1 and anti-apo B100 antibodies by immunoaffinity gel analysis. Apoproteins, apoprotein E phenotype, post-heparin lipoprotein lipase, and Lp AI (HDL with apo AI and without apo AII) can be measured by the commercially available kits. Modified LDLs (glycated, oxidative) increase in DM, but their measurements remain complicated at the moment. Analysis of plasma fatty acids by gaschromatography is useful for dietary assessment. The measurement of these new markers seems to be useful to assess the extent of atherogenic risk in DM."

Gemfibrozil 600mg twice daily was administered to induce these changes in lipoprotein levels. Baseline HDL-cholesterol levels in the study group were similar to those in the general population. Data from patients treated with placebo were analysed to investigate the influence of HDL-cholesterol levels on the incidence of coronary heart disease. Using the number of cardiac end-points per 1000 person-years to indicate the risk of coronary heart disease, it was clear that elevated HDL-cholesterol levels reduced the risk of coronary heart disease while the incidence increased at low HDL-cholesterol levels. This relationship was not altered when the effect of HDL-cholesterol levels was analysed jointly with other coronary risk factors (age, smoking or blood pressure). A weaker association was seen between LDL-cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease, and triglycerides appeared to have no significant effect on the incidence of the disease. The data clearly suggest that HDL-cholesterol is a strong predictor of the incidence of coronary heart disease in the placebo group of the Helsinki Heart Study."

Age- and body-mass-adjusted levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure were lowest for those with normoglycemia, intermediate for those with IGT, and highest for those with NIDDM. Age- and body-mass-adjusted levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lowest for those with NIDDM, intermediate for those with IGT, and highest for those with normoglycemia, while triglyceride levels were highest for those with NIDDM, intermediate for those with IGT, and lowest for those with normoglycemia in women but not in men. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were lowest for those with NIDDM, intermediate for those with IGT, and highest for those with normoglycemia. With the exception of men with IGT, no differences by glycemic strata were observed for plasma total cholesterol. The prevalence of smoking showed no consistent pattern by glycemic status. These findings suggest that individuals with IGT have an atherogenic risk factor pattern that may put them at greater risk for coronary heart disease than those with normoglycemia.

This association was independent of age, sex, glucose intolerance, and body mass index but was not independent of fasting triglyceride or insulin levels. Further, an increase of 5A in LDL diameter was associated with a 16% decrease in risk of NIDDM, and a composite variable of LDL diameter and triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations, identified by principal-components analysis, was also associated with NIDDM.

Each patient was treated for a duration of 2 weeks, with an individual washout period of 8 weeks. Metabolic variables and intravenous glucose tolerances (1.2 mmol/kg body weight, t = 30 min) were determined on days 1 and 15 of each treatment period. Plasma lipid concentrations were identical at baseline, but were reduced more markedly following G as against FO exposure (% change vs. baseline: total cholesterol (chol), - 13**/-6* (G vs FO: p = 0.05); total triglycerides (TG), -39**/-18** (p < 0.05); APO B, -17**/- 10* (N.S.); LDL-chol, -15**/0 (p < 0.02); VLDL-chol, -50***/- 34*** (N.S.); VLDL-TG, -44***/-27** (N.S.); (p vs. baseline: * < 0.05, ** < 0.01, *** < 0.001). Total-HDL, HDL2, HDL3 and APO A were not influenced by either FO or G. Neither FO nor G induced a change in intravenous glucose tolerances or associated basal and incremental concentrations of insulin and C-peptide. We concluded, based on short-time applications, that (a) neither treatment affected the carbohydrate metabolism in patients with NIDDM, and (b) a greater hypolipidemic efficacy had to be assigned to Gemfibrozil than to fish oil. It would therefore appear that Gemfibrozil acts as a useful lipostatic pharmacologic compound, whilst fish oil could serve as a potential ingredient of a prudent cardio-protective diet which favours the low plasma triglyceride concentrations found in NIDDM patients."

Although risk factors that affect the general population such as age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, obesity and hypercholesterolaemia also affect diabetic subjects, the increased prevalence of hypertension and obesity in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) only partially explains the increased morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD). Other factors must therefore be considered in this group of patients. Triglyceride concentrations, particularly post-prandial levels, may be important. Diabetic subjects have increased very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL), increased intermediate-density-lipoprotein (IDL) and low high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations, and differences in lipoprotein composition may partly explain increased atherogenesis. Although LDL levels of diabetic patients are not different from those of control subjects. LDL particles are potentially atherogenic as they are smaller, more dense and prone to oxidative modification. NIDDM subjects also have altered apolipoprotein concentrations, including increased apoB, apoC-III, and decreased apoA-I; in addition, apoE-2 may be over-represented in diabetic populations.

In an unexpected reciprocal manner, lowering LDL-cholesterol with statins slightly increases the risk of diabetes. Here we review the latest findings.\n    \n\n\n          Recent findings:\n        \n      \n      The inverse relationship between LDL-cholesterol and diabetes has now been confirmed by multiple lines of evidence. This includes clinical trials, genetic instruments using aggregate single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as at least eight individual genes - HMGCR, NPC1L1, HNF4A, GCKR, APOE, PCKS9, TM6SF2, and PNPLA3 - support this inverse association. Genetic and pharmacologic evidence suggest that HDL-cholesterol may also be inversely associated with diabetes risk. Regarding the effects of diabetes on lipoproteins, new evidence suggests that insulin resistance but not diabetes per se may explain impaired secretion and clearance of VLDL-triglycerides. Weight loss, bariatric surgery, and incretin-based therapies all lower triglycerides, whereas SGLT2 inhibitors may slightly increase HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.\n    \n\n\n          Summary:\n        \n      \n      Diabetes and lipoproteins are highly interregulated. Further research is expected to uncover new mechanisms governing the metabolism of glucose, fat, and cholesterol. This topic has important implications for treating type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease."

To examine whether there was individual variability in the response of these parameters to alcohol drinking, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 3130 men with a body-mass index (BMI) below 24. The subjects were divided into two groups; a normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (rGTP) (<40 IU/l) group and a high rGTP (> or =40 IU/l) group, and the values were compared after adjusted for age, BMI, exercise and smoking. The level of triglycerides increased according to the amount of drinking in the high rGTP group, whereas no association was observed in the normal rGTP group. The level of HDL-cholesterol increased with drinking in the normal and high rGTP groups, and no difference was observed in the levels of HDL-cholesterol between the two groups. The levels of uric acid and blood pressure also increased with drinking in both groups, but the increase was bigger in the high rGTP group than in the normal rGTP group. The results indicated that there was large individual variability in the responses of the risk factors for coronary heart disease to drinking. Subjects whose rGTP responds less to drinking may have less disadvantageous effects of drinking."

Many NIDDM patients also have raised serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, which may require drug therapy, as well as increased plasma nonesterified fatty acid concentrations. Some hypolipidemic agents such as bezafibrate lower fatty acid levels as well as LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. It has been suggested that raised fatty acid levels may be responsible in part for the increased hepatic glucose output and insulin insensitivity of NIDDM. Several groups have therefore sought to examine the effects of fibrates on glycemic control in NIDDM. In our own studies, we used bezafibrate (200 mg t.i.d.) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design for 3 months. Fasting blood glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide, plasma nonesterified fatty acids, blood lactate and alanine, serum triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol were all lowered. HbA1 showed no significant change. Meal hormone and metabolite profiles were all improved although this reflected mainly the lower premeal values.

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among the established risk factors, the lipid triad (elevated triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is a powerful risk factor for atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of hypertriglyceridaemia (HTG) in type 2 diabetes is two to three times higher than in non-diabetics. The Copenhagen Male study, the AMORIS study, and several other trials showed hypertriglyceridaemia to be an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD). HTG may promote risk both directly and indirectly through association with alterations of lipoprotein size and composition. The Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) demonstrated that raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with low (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is associated with a significant reduction in CHD risk. It was shown in the Diabetes Intervention Study, AFCAPS/TexCAPS, and PROCAM studies that decreased HDL-C and elevated triglycerides are independent risk factors for atherosclerosis, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus. Several epidemiological studies demonstrated that total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C) ratios or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratios could be better predictors of atherosclerosis than any single lipid parameter. Intima-media thickness (IMT), a well established marker of early atherosclerosis, is associated with HTG/low HDL-cholesterol. In the Risk factors in IGT for Atherosclerosis and Diabetes (RIAD) study total and HDL-cholesterol were independent determinants of IMT in subjects at risk for type 2 diabetes. Postprandial HTG was also shown to be correlated with increased IMT in type 2 diabetic patients."

Lp(a) was investigated as a CHD risk factor in the PRIME Study, a prospective cohort study which included 9133 French and Northern Irish men aged 50-59 at entry, without a history of CHD and not on hypolipidaemic drugs. During a follow-up of 5 years, 288 subjects experienced at least one CHD event (myocardial infarction (MI), coronary death, angina pectoris). Lp(a) was measured by immunoassay in all subjects on fresh plasma obtained at entry. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, the presence of diabetes, hypertension or smoking were determined. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate Lp(a) level as a CHD risk factor after controlling for the other risk factors. In addition, its possible interaction with LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels was investigated. Lp(a) appeared a significant risk factor (P<0.0006) in the whole cohort without between-population interaction, even if the association was not statistically significant in the Belfast sample. The relative risk (RR) of CHD events in subjects with Lp(a) levels in the highest quartile was 1.5 times that of subjects in the lowest quartile (RR: 1.56; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.10-2.21). A high Lp(a) level was a risk for MI, coronary death and angina pectoris. A significant interaction term between Lp(a) and LDL-cholesterol levels, however, was found. The relative CHD risk associated with a Lp(a) level > or =33 mg/dl in comparison with Lp(a) <33 mg/dl increasing gradually from 0.82 (95% CI: 0.28-2.44) in men with LDL-cholesterol in the lowest quartile (<121 mg/dl) to 1.58 (95% CI: 1.06-2.40) in the highest quartile (>163 mg/dl). In conclusion, Lp(a) increased the risk for MI and angina pectoris, especially in men with a high LDL-cholesterol level. This study which analyzed Lp(a) level using a measurement independent of apolipoprotein (a) size on fresh plasma, has confirmed utility of Lp(a) as a predictor of CHD."

Greater reported weekly distance run by vegetarians was associated with greater HDL-cholesterol concentrations [slopes +/- SEs for men and women, respectively: 0.003 +/- 0.001 and 0.005 +/- 0.002 (mmol/L)/km] and lower waist (-0.06 +/- 0.02 and-0.08 +/- 0.02 cm/km), hip (-0.05 +/- 0.03 and -0.07 +/- 0.02 cm/km), and chest (-0.05 +/- 0.02 cm/km for both) circumferences.

Men who ran > 72 km and drank > 177 mL (6 oz) alcohol/wk were five times more likely to have clinically defined high HDL cholesterol (> or = 1.55 mmol/L, or > or = 60 mg/dL) than were nondrinkers running < 24 km/wk. Regardless of running level, men's blood pressure increased in association with alcohol intake. These data suggest that 1) running distance in vegetarians and vegans has the same relation to HDL cholesterol (increasing) and adiposity (decreasing) as reported previously for omnivores, 2) alcohol and running distance contribute independently to higher HDL cholesterol, and 3) running does not abate the hypertensive effects of alcohol in men.

Methods and Results The open-label, blinded end-point, EVADE CAD (Effects of a Vegan Versus the American Heart Association-Recommended Diet in Coronary Artery Disease) trial randomized participants (n=100) with coronary artery disease to 8 weeks of a vegan or American Heart Association-recommended diet with provision of groceries, tools to measure dietary intake, and dietary counseling. The primary end point was high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A linear regression model compared end points after 8 weeks of a vegan versus American Heart Association diet and adjusted for baseline concentration of the end point. Significance levels for the primary and secondary end points were set at 0.05 and 0.0015, respectively. A vegan diet resulted in a significant 32% lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (β, 0.68, 95% confidence interval [0.49-0.94]; P=0.02) when compared with the American Heart Association diet. Results were consistent after adjustment for age, race, baseline waist circumference, diabetes mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction (adjusted β, 0.67 [0.47-0.94], P=0.02).

The bulk of current evidence suggests that these complications can be minimized or perhaps even avoided by carefully monitoring and controlling the patient's blood glucose levels. Although criteria and standards of control differ widely in various centers, in general acceptable-to-good control in the NIDDM patient would consist of average fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels of less than 140 mg/dL and peak postprandial glucoses of less than 220 to 250 mg/dL. Treatment aimed at attaining these blood glucose levels should begin with dietary management and exercise prescription. General health measurements such as control of blood pressure and avoidance of smoking are especially important in the diabetic patient. When these approaches prove ineffectual, the addition of an oral hypoglycemic agent, preferably a second-generation sulfonylurea is indicated. Glipizide and glyburide are both excellent drug choices, although glyburide may cause hypoglycemia in older patients due to its longer half-life and especially in those with renal insufficiency because of accumulation of biologically active metabolites. In certain well-selected cases, the addition of insulin to oral sulfonylurea therapy may offer improved results over the use of either therapeutic modality alone. The advent of self blood glucose monitoring and periodic glycohemoglobin assessments, now well established in diabetic management, represents a major step forward in the endeavor to optimize standards of blood glucose control in the diabetic population."

The Ser447-Ter mutation was determined by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The allelic frequency of the Ser447-Ter mutation was 0.103 in all subjects. The Ser447-Ter (GG and CG) group was associated with significantly higher levels of plasma HDL-cholesterol (p<0.001) and lower levels of plasma triglyceride than the CC group (p<0.02).

Abnormal lipoproteins are major risk factors leading to arteriosclerosis in general and specifically to coronary artery disease. Lipid-related risk factors should be evaluated in a stepwise process. The first step involves screening for raised fasting levels of blood cholesterol and triglycerides. Depending on the initial results, further classification may be required based on the blood levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL). Concentration of low density lipoproteins (LDL) can be calculated from blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL levels. These two parameters, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol are essential to evaluate the risk of coronary artery disease. Currently, it is difficult to interpret the results of apolipoprotein AI and B assays since it has not been proved that the evaluation of coronary risk, as defined from HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels, is modified with the incorporation of apolipoprotein values. In addition, assay methods have not been standardized, hindering the use of apolipoprotein levels in evaluating risk. The basic assay methods provide a wide range of results, making it possible to measure subfractions of lipoproteins which would play a protective preventive role against arteriosclerosis. Lipoprotein A1 (LpAI) is protective while Lp(a) is an atherogenic lipoprotein. Both LpAI and Lp(a) are now routine laboratory tests and provide essential information for helping the clinician define the risk of arteriosclerosis and thus to make therapeutic decisions. In the future, genetic markers will undoubtedly provide better means of appreciating the pathophysiological mechanisms of arteriosclerosis and thus the risk of arterial lesions."

            "abstract": "Serum lipid and lipoprotein values of 32 male patients suffering from gout were quantitated and compared with corresponding values of a random control group which did not differ significantly with regard to age, body weight index and socio-economic status. All patients were on therapy with allopurinol which lasted on average for 6 years. The most striking differences between patients and controls were the increased triglyceride and apo B values and the decreased HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and HDL-phospholipid (HDL-PL) values in the patient group. The values of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apo A-I and Lp (a) were not significantly different between patients and controls. The great differences in the ratios of apo B/LDL-C, apo A-I/HDL-C and apo A-I/HDL-PL values suggest that gout is connected with changes in the chemical composition of the major lipoprotein classes. In three normolipemic individuals who were treated for 3 weeks with allopurinol no changes in lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were apparent. The results are discussed in view of the atherosclerosis risk of patients suffering from gout."

LDL cholesterol decreased by 10% (113 +/- 31 to 103 +/- 32 mg/dL, P less than 0.01) and total HDL-cholesterol levels increased by 9% (65 +/- 18 to 71 +/- 19 mg/dL, P less than 0.01) the day after the race. No changes in the concentration of apolipoprotein A-I or A-II occurred. Triglyceride levels decreased by 39% (95 +/- 38 to 58 +/- 23 mg/dL, P less than 0.001). Two days after the race, total HDL cholesterol (74 +/- 21 mg/dL, P less than 0.05) and the HDL2 subfraction (37 +/- 19 mg/dL, P less than 0.05) remained significantly elevated compared to pre-race values. Most dramatically, the level of lipoprotein lipase activity measured in postheparin plasma nearly doubled after the race, demonstrating that vigorous exercise acutely increases this enzyme activity. The increase in lipoprotein lipase activity probably mediated the fall in serum triglycerides after exercise and may also account for the increase in HDL cholesterol."

Glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting serum total cholesterol, total high density lipoprotein (HDL), HDL2, low density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), and triglycerides were measured in all subjects. Peripheral vascular disease was defined as an ankle/brachial systolic pressure < 1.0 as measured by the Doppler technique. Multivariate analysis was performed and the following factors were identified as being strongly associated with the presence of PVD with a statistical significance of p < 0.001; LDL-cholesterol, total HDL-cholesterol, age, male sex, diet or oral hypoglycaemic therapy, diastolic blood pressure, and of p < 0.003; systolic blood pressure.

This study was conducted in December 2000 (Ramadan 1421) when the length of fasting was 12 hours a day. It included 38 type 2 diabetic patients (20 males and 18 females). Mean patient age was 51.410.5 years and mean body mass index (BMI) 28.94.7kg/m2. Three patients were treated with diet and 35 with oral hypoglycemic agents. Clinical and biochemical parameters were evaluated during three periods: three weeks before Ramadan (T0), at the fourth week of Ramadan (T1) and three weeks after the end of Ramadan (T2). During the month of Ramadan, a decrease in weight (0.52kg) and no change in blood pressure were observed. No metabolic complication occurred in our patients. A significant effect of Ramadan fasting was observed on glycemic control and lipoprotein levels. In patients whose fructosamine level before Ramadan was higher than 340micromol/l, plasma fasting glucose and serum fructosamine increased during Ramadan (p<0.003) and returned to initial levels at the end of Ramadan T2; in these patients also, a decrease of HDL-cholesterol (p<0.01) associated with an increase of LDL-cholesterol (p<0.003) were observed at T1 and disappeared at T2. But, in patients whose fructosamine level at T0 was lower than 340micromol/l, no effect on glycemic control and no significant effect on serum lipoprotein levels were found during Ramadan month. Ramadan fasting in type 2 diabetic patients seems to cause slight effects on glycemia and lipoprotein levels when previous metabolic control is quite good; but fasting induces more deterioration when previous control is poor."

Controls were selected for similar age, smoking habits and relative body weight characteristics compared to the CAD group. Covariance analysis with adjustment for hyperlipoproteinemia, apoprotein E phenotype, smoking, age and relative body weight revealed that high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was the only parameter that differed significantly between both groups. By logistic regression analysis HDL-cholesterol had the highest predictive power for the development of CAD. The LDL-chol/LDL apo B ratio appeared significantly different between controls and CAD patients (3.1 +/- 0.7 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6 mmol/g, P less than 0.05), indicating a predominance of subjects with protein-enriched LDL in the CAD group. However, within the group of CAD patients with normal LDL-cholesterol levels no clear distinction could be found between patients with normal and increased LDL apo B levels. Furthermore, it appeared that the LDL-chol/LDL apo B ratio correlated significantly with age (p = -0.24), serum triglycerides (p = -0.24), and HDL-cholesterol (p = 0.24). Thus, the LDL-chol/LDL apo B ratio cannot be considered an independent risk factor for CAD. When adjusted for age, smoking habits and relative body weight the significance of protein-enriched LDL as a risk factor for coronary heart disease diminishes, and HDL-cholesterol appears to be the best indicator for CAD."

Group 1 tended to have the smallest mean particle sizes in the HDL subfractions, significantly (P < 0.03, CAD vs. non-CAD) for HDL2b and for HDL2a. These differences were independent of TG, insulin and HL, but lost their significance when adjusted for beta-blocker therapy. Both HDL2 and HDL3 particles in group 1 were significantly depleted of unesterified cholesterol, and their HDL2 was TG-enriched (P = 0.053). A high HL activity, hyperinsulinemia and hypertriglyceridemia are independently associated with low levels of HDL2b and generally small HDL particle size.

            "abstract": "To determine whether the risk of obesity-associated dyslipidemia in children is influenced by apolipoprotein E (apoE) polymorphism, we studied 137 obese, nongenetically related children aged 2.2-14.4 y (mean age, 9.9 +/- 3.1 y) with a weight-for-height excess of 43.7 +/- 17.9%. The apoE genotype was determined by studying specific DNA restriction patterns. Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides were assayed in plasma before dietary treatment initiation. ApoE allele and phenotype distributions were comparable to those reported in the Caucasian population at large. Fifty-five children (41%) had elevated lipid levels. Compared with obese children with the epsilon3 or epsilon4 allele, those with the epsilon2 allele were more likely to have hypertriglyceridemia (19.5% versus 52.9%, p < 0.05) and had a higher mean triglyceride level: children with the epsilon4 allele were more likely to have a LDL-cholesterol elevation (34.7% versus 13.4%, p < 0.05). Our data demonstrate that, even in childhood, obesity is associated with a marked increase in the risk of lipoprotein abnormalities and that the latter are influenced by apoE polymorphism."

Most of the vegetarians included in the study were members of the German Society of Vegetarians. The study program included capillary blood cholesterol measurements and the determination of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, the measurement of other cardiovascular risk factors and the evaluation of dietary and life-style factors. Evaluation of cardiovascular risk profile within LSL was connected with individual consultation. The mean total cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol level and the total: HDL-cholesterol ratio showed the expected age-dependence, with maximum values within the decade 60-70 years. Vegetarians showed lower total and non-HDL-cholesterol levels in comparison with the general population. Furthermore, the age-dependent increase of these parameters is less pronounced under the conditions of vegetarian nutrition and life-style. Especially in young adulthood a significant difference is observed. Thus, the results of the present study reveal the role of nutritional and life-style factors that determine the lipid profile on a population basis and suggest that the known age-dependent rise of the level of atherogenic plasma lipoproteins is partly preventable."

Their prevalence increases with rising age. The hitherto assume dependence on age for cholesterol and triglycerides is first of all to be traced back to this phenomenon.

            "abstract": "With growing urbanization and economic development, there is a rapid increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in India. T2DM is associated with 2-4 times higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. Several studies have shown the benefit of intensive glycaemic control in reducing the frequency of diabetic microvascular complications such as retinopathy and nephropathy. Results of long term follow up of patients with diabetes, who were enrolled in earlier trials, have shown that initial intensive glycaemic control led to a reduction in CVD outcomes when compared with standard therapy. However, it is unclear if intensive glycaemic control, aiming to reduce haemoglobin A1c to levels even lower than the current goal of <7%, will similarly lead to reduction in the rates of CVD. Recently, the results of 3 large, randomized controlled trials have been published, which suggest that in established T2DM with previous CVD or high risk of CVD, the benefits of intensive glycaemic control when compared with conventional good control, are minimal with regards to reduction of cardiovascular outcomes. Intensive therapy increases the risk of side-effects such as severe hypoglycaemia and weight gain. The implementation of such a therapy, with rigorous attention to frequent monitoring of blood glucose and visits to the physician, is not likely to be possible on a large scale, especially in a developing country such as India. The aim of management of patients with established T2DM should be to achieve the goal of good glycaemic control (haemoglobin A1c<7%), with avoidance of hypoglycaemia. It is equally, if not more important, to control other risk factors of CVD by paying greater attention to lifestyle measures (weight loss if overweight or obese, regular exercise, cessation of smoking), rigorous control of blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<100 mg/dl or <70 mg/dl if already diagnosed with CVD) and the prophylactic use of low dose aspirin as per current recommendations. A multifactorial approach targeting multiple cardiovascular risk factors is likely to be most effective in reducing CVD outcomes in T2DM."

            "abstract": "Based on substantial evidence, the 1984 NIH Consensus Development Conference concluded that the treatment of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol elevations with diet and, when necessary, with drugs, can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, in 1988 the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) published guidelines for defining moderate-, borderline-high-, and high-risk categories for CAD. Many clinical trials have supported the benefits of antihyperlipidemic therapy. Evidence from the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial gave rise to the \"2:1 ratio,\" i.e., that a 1% reduction in total cholesterol level is associated with a 2% decrease in CAD events. The Helsinki Heart Study results indicated that additional benefit may be obtained by raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Dramatic reductions in LDL and total cholesterol were achieved by the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, which also achieved a 35% reduction in CAD events and a two-thirds reduction in both coronary bypass operations and angioplasties. Long-term benefits of cholesterol lowering in terms of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality have been shown in the Coronary Drug Project and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. Two major studies that have documented angiographic changes as a result of cholesterol lowering are the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS). In both CLAS and FATS, there was a decrease in the development of new lesions and a lowering of the rate of progression of existing lesions. In FATS, there was also evidence that aggressive antihyperlipidemic therapy will decrease existing lesions in some CAD patients."

Qualitative changes in low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL) are thought to be important for evaluating the risk for CAD. In the present study, we evaluated LDL particle size (LDL-size) by 2%-16% gradient gel electrophoresis, along with conventional lipids and apolipoproteins, in 23 children with IDDM (10 males and 13 females) and 27 nondiabetic controls (12 males and 15 females). The fractional and molar esterification rates (FER and MER) of cholesterol in plasma and HDL were also determined. Plasma levels of triglyceride were significantly lower in diabetic children than in controls. Plasma apoA-I and apoA-II levels in female diabetic children were significantly higher and lower than those in controls respectively. Plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol and the ratio of apoA-I to apoA-II were significantly higher in diabetic children than in controls. Other lipid and apolipoprotein parameters in diabetic children were similar to those in controls. LDL-size in diabetic children was significantly greater than that in controls. FERHDL, which reflects the particle size distribution of HDL, was significantly lower in diabetic children than in controls, which suggests that diabetic children had larger HDL particles.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The qualitative and quantitative changes in LDL and HDL in diabetic children are similar to those associated with a reduced risk for CAD.

Eighty-five patients aged less than 65 years and not treated with insulin were studied. The overnight albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured in each patient and analysed in relation to several putative risk factors for cardiovascular disease. AER was used both as a continuous variable and after dividing patients into high-risk (AER greater than or equal to 10 micrograms min-1) and low-risk (AER less than 10 micrograms min-1) groups. By both methods of analysis AER was significantly correlated with both seated and supine diastolic blood pressure levels and with resting heart rate. Body mass index and waist-hip ratio appeared higher and HDL-cholesterol lower in the at-risk group, but differences were not statistically significant. The level of Factor VII was not significantly lower in the at-risk group.

When determining the correlation of these biochemical parameters with the anthropometrical parameters of BP, age, weight, height, Quetelet Index, body mass surface, skinfold thickness and the percentage of subcutaneous fat (after the necessary logarithmic transformations, adjusted to each age and sex group by Z-scores) we find that none of the correlation coefficients are significant. The triglycerides and the HDL-cholesterol have a low, but significant. The triglycerides and the HDL-cholesterol have a low, but significantly, correlation with the other lipid parameters.

Diet treatment also decreased the elevated TG and VLDL-cholesterol in diabetic patients to control values. Although heart rate and systolic blood pressure were higher, diastolic blood pressure was not different in diabetic patients than those in controls. Ventricular hypertrophy was also observed in ECGs of 10% of diabetic patients. Diet treatment normalized all of these findings, except systolic blood pressure.

We confirmed the positive correlation between FBS and HBA1C. All diabetic patients had significantly higher triglyceride levels (P less than 0.05) than controls, which were not influenced by degree of glycaemic control. NIDDM patients tended to have higher than normal TC levels (P less than 0.05).

It is concluded that lipoprotein abnormalities exist in Nigerian diabetics, though not as consistently as in Caucasians. The differences may be due to, among other factors, differences in genetic make-up, diet (typical African diet being rich in plant fibre and poor in cholesterogenic nutrients) and aetiology of the diabetic state (tropical diabetes being highly heterogeneous and now thought to be linked to malnutrition)."

Waist girth was the sole predictor of triglycerides and HDL-C, explaining 44 and 31% of the variance, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These findings suggest that the CVD risk factor profile of habitual exercisers is attributable to leanness and exercise. Leanness is associated with favourable levels of HDL-C and triglycerides, while exercise is associated with lower levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo B."

            "abstract": "Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) include particularly elevated levels of total and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are usually normal if glycemic control is adequate. The worsening of glycemic control deteriorates lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities and particularly total and LDL cholesterol levels are often elevated in patients with poor glycemic control. According to prospective population-based studies total cholesterol is a powerful risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in NIDDM patients as in nondiabetic subjects. In contrast, high total triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol may be even stronger risk factors for CHD in NIDDM patients than in nondiabetic individuals, but more prospective studies are needed to substantiate this view. Compositional changes in LDL and VLDL particles may further increase the risk for CHD but epidemiologic data are missing to support this notion. Preliminary data from the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study including 202 diabetic patients seem to indicate that diabetic patients benefit from simvastatin treatment equally to nondiabetic subjects."

The soy-based low-calorie group consumed soy protein as the only protein source, and the traditional low-calorie group consumed two-thirds animal protein and the rest plant protein in a 1200 kcal/d diet for 8 wk. A diet record was kept everyday throughout the study. Food intake was analyzed before and after the study. Anthropometric data were acquired every week, and biochemical data from before and after the 8-wk experiment were compared.\n## RESULTS\nBody weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference significantly decreased in both groups (P < 0.05). The decrease in body fat percentage in the soy group (2.2%, 95% confidence interval 1.6-2.8) was greater than that in the traditional group (1.4%, 95% confidence interval -0.1 to 2.8). Serum total cholesterol concentrations, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, and liver function parameters decreased in the soy-based group and were significantly different from measurements in the traditional group (P < 0.05). No significant change in serum triacylglycerol levels, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose levels was found in the soy or traditional group.\n## CONCLUSION\nSoy-based low-calorie diets significantly decreased serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and had a greater effect on reducing body fat percentage than traditional low-calorie diets. Thus, soy-based diets have health benefits in reducing weight and blood lipids.\n"

            "abstract": "In adults hyperinsulinaemia is associated with an atherogenic risk profile including obesity, low levels of HDL-cholesterol, high levels of triglycerides and elevated blood pressure. To examine these associations in the young we studied the cross-sectional relationships of insulin with obesity indices (body mass index, subscapular skinfold thickness), serum lipids and blood pressure in 1,865 children, adolescents and young adults aged 6-24 years. We also used longitudinal data to study the value of a single insulin measurement to predict high risk factor levels and clustering of multiple risk factors after a 6-year follow-up. In cross-sectional analyses the levels of triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure and obesity indices were usually significantly different across the quartiles of fasting insulin in both sexes among children, adolescents and young adults. In general, no associations were seen with total cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol. In prospective analysis elevated baseline insulin was related to the incidence of hypertriglyceridaemia (> or = 95th percentile) at the follow-up. This relationship persisted even after adjustments for baseline obesity or 6-year change in obesity status. Moreover, baseline insulin concentration was higher in subjects who subsequently showed clustering of high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol and high systolic blood pressure levels at the follow-up. We conclude that high fasting insulin levels measured in children and adolescents predict the development of hypertriglyceridaemia years later. In addition, high insulin levels seem to precede the development of a potentially atherogenic risk factor profile including low HDL-cholesterol, high triglycerides and high systolic blood pressure."

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in the Korean population and to explore the relationship between RLP-C and other biochemical markers as well as the apolipoprotein (apo) E genotypes. Lipid and lipoproteins including RLP-C and apo E genotypes were analyzed in 98 normal adults (control group), 68 patients with CAD (CAD group), 88 patients with NIDDM (DM group), and 19 patients with both CAD and NDDM (CAD + DM group). RLP-C levels were significantly higher in the DM (p < 0.0001), CAD (p = 0.0012) and the CAD + DM groups (p = 0.0184) than in the controls. To determine which variable could discriminate most effectively and independently among the different groups, stepwise linear discriminant analysis was performed for all the variables that showed p < 0.15 by univariate analysis. RLP-C was selected as an independent discriminator between the control and patient groups. RLP-C levels showed a strong positive correlation with trigylceride levels in the control, CAD and DM groups (r = 0.783, r = 0.610 and r = 0.746, respectively). In overall groups, apo epsilon4 and epsilon2 carrier genotypes showed a significant increase in RLP-C levels compared with epsilon3/3 wild-type (p = 0.0085). After adjusting for the effect of apo E genotypes, a significant increase of the RLP-C levels in the disease groups remained. In conclusion, RLP-C was determined to be an independent risk factor in Korean patients with CAD and NIDDM and showed a strong correlation with triglyceride levels. We suggest that the increased cardiovascular risk associated with the epsilon4 and epsilon2 allele may be mediated by more atherogenic RLP-C."

These results demonstrate that complementary insulin therapy probably induces antiatherogenic lipoprotein changes in NIDDM patients previously treated by either OHA or INS 1-2x. Thus, this type of therapy should be used more often and start earlier, and should be preferred to longacting insulins."

This study was designed to measure HDL cholesterol, apo A-I, and, using a new procedure, Lp A-I in 233 healthy normolipidaemic young men (cholesterol less than 250 mg dl-1 and triglycerides less than 200 mg dl-1). Among these subjects, the composition of HDL was very variable as indicated by the 10th and the 90th percentiles of the HDL-cholesterol/apo A-I ratios which were 0.32 and 0.49, respectively. The 10th and 90th percentiles of apo A-I and Lp A-I:A-II were 126 and 167 mg dl-1 and 83 and 116 mg dl-1, respectively. On the other hand, Lp A-I showed a much larger variation, the 10th and 90th percentiles being at 33 and 62 mg dl-1, respectively. The distribution of individual values of Lp A-I showed that this fraction of apo A-I-containing particles was very variable among subjects, the Lp A-I/apo A-I ratio extending from 0.18 to 0.58. Triglycerides, Lp A-I and Lp A-I:A-II were correlated with HDL cholesterol, but no correlation between apo A-I containing subfractions and plasma triglycerides was noticed. Since preliminary results from angiographic and clinical studies show that Lp A-I could exert a protective role for atherosclerosis, it would seem that the measurement of Lp A-I might help in the future to characterize better the individual's risk for atherosclerosis."

Pearson's correlation assessed relationship of AHEI score to hemoglobin A1c and body weight changes.\n## RESULTS\nBoth groups reported significant decreases in energy, protein, fat, cholesterol, vitamin D, selenium, and sodium intakes. The vegan group also significantly reduced reported intakes of vitamin B-12 and calcium, and significantly increased carbohydrate, fiber, total vitamin A activity, beta carotene, vitamins K and C, folate, magnesium, and potassium. The American Diabetes Association recommended diet group also reported significant decreases in carbohydrate and iron, but reported no significant increases. The vegan group significantly improved its AHEI score (P<0.0001), while the American Diabetes Association recommended diet group did not (P=0.7218). The difference in AHEI score at 22 weeks between groups was significant (P<0.0001). With both groups combined, AHEI score was negatively correlated with both changes in hemoglobin A1c value (r=-0.24, P=0.016) and weight (r=-0.27, P=0.007).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nVegan diets increase intakes of carbohydrate, fiber, and several micronutrients, in contrast with the American Diabetes Association recommended diet.

Under treatment, atherogenic lipids (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides) had significantly decreased (p < 0.05) and antiatherogenic fraction (HDL-cholesterol) significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to initial values. In the mean time, the BMI has significantly decreased under fenofibrate treatment, this body mass loss having a positive influence on lipid metabolism. We observed a better therapeutically response in obese patients vs. the overweight ones, probably due to a higher prevalence of the hypertension in the second subgroup.

            "abstract": "Although elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol is a well established coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor, the ability to adequately discriminate high-risk individuals by this risk factor alone is limited and other metabolic risk variables are known to modulate CHD risk. For instance, it has been reported that the cluster of metabolic disturbances observed among individuals with abdominal obesity, the so-called metabolic syndrome, is associated with a substantially increased risk of CHD. Among the features of the dyslipidaemic profile observed in these individuals, the high triglyceride-low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol dyslipidaemia is predictive of an elevated risk of CHD. Fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) have been used in clinical practice for more than 2 decades as a class of agents known to decrease triglyceride levels while substantially increasing HDL-cholesterol levels, with a limited but significant additional lowering effect on LDL-cholesterol levels. Although the clinical benefits of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been well documented by primary and secondary prevention trials that justify their widespread use, it was not until the publication of the VA-HIT (Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial) that the relevance of identifying HDL-cholesterol as a therapeutic target to reduce the risk of recurrent CHD events was finally confirmed. The clinical benefits of fibrate therapy are especially important in the subpopulation of patients with low HDL-cholesterol levels with the metabolic syndrome, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or in abdominally obese, hyperinsulinaemic patients. Evidence also suggests that there is a 'fibrate effect' that mediates the reduction in CHD risk beyond the favourable impact of these agents on HDL-cholesterol levels. This last notion is consistent with the pleiotropic effects of fibrates which are known to be related to their mechanisms of action. Through peroxisome proliferator-activated alpha-receptors, fibrates have a significant impact on the synthesis of several apolipoproteins (apo) and enzymes of lipoprotein metabolism as well as on the expression of several genes involved in fibrinolysis and inflammation. Fibrate therapy has been reported to decrease apo CIII levels (a powerful inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase) and increase apo AI levels, as well as to increase lipoprotein lipase activity. Such changes contribute to improve the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, leading to a substantial increase in HDL-cholesterol levels accompanied by a shift in the size and density of LDL particles (from small, dense LDL particles to larger, more buoyant cholesteryl ester-rich LDL). It is proposed that some of these pleiotropic effects could explain some of the clinical benefits of fibrate therapy beyond its HDL-raising properties, particularly among patients with abdominal obesity, hyperinsulinaemia or type 2 diabetes with both low HDL- and low/normal LDL-cholesterol levels."

Primary goals for the management of hypertriglyceridemia are a reduction of cardiovascular risk and prevention of triglyceride associated complications such as the chylomicronemia syndrome. The basis of treatment are lifestyle changes: dietary intervention, alcohol avoidance, regular physical activity, weight loss and smoking cessation to modify risk factors. If triglyceride levels can not be sufficiently reduced by lifestyle intervention pharmacotherapy (nicotinic acid, fibrates and omega-3-acid ethyl esters) is indicated.

            "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to establish if individuals with Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) and periodontal diseases (gingivitis or periodontitis) presented an increase in the concentration of modified LDL (moLDL) and what is the influence of periodontal treatment on the decrease of moLDL particles with consequent improvement in the parameters of DM2. Twenty-four diabetic patients with periodontitis (Group 1) and twenty-four diabetic patients with gingivitis (Group 2) were followed up for a period of 12 months. Group 1 was treated with periodontal debridement, and Group 2 received supra-gingival scaling and prophylaxis. In both groups, periodontal clinical parameters: probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), gingival resection (GR), bleeding on probing index (BOP) and plaque index; inflammatory serum markers (glycemia, A1c, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides and hs-CRP) and oxidized LDL (oxLDL) were measured at baseline, t = 6 and t = 12 months after treatment. Solutions of LDL were analyzed using the nonlinear optical Z-Scan and optical absorption techniques. The periodontal clinical parameters showed significant improvement (p < 0.05) in both Group after 12 months. For both groups, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, triglycerides and A1c levels did not show significant reductions after periodontal therapy. hs-CRP levels in Group 1 presented a significant reduction after 12 months. The glycemic rate and the oxLDL concentrations did not show significant differences as a function of time. The optical measurements of LDL solutions revealed an improvement of the LDL-c quality in both groups. Periodontal debridement was able to improve periodontal parameters and the quality of LDL-c in diabetic patients but without changes in the oxLDL concentration in both groups. Considering the clinical relevance, the reduction of infectious and inflammatory sites present in the oral cavity through periodontal therapy may help with the control and prevention of hyperglycemia and precursors of cardiovascular diseases."

In this quasi-experimental study 22 otherwise healthy diabetic patients, 14 women (63.6%) and eight men (36.4%), were recruited from among patients referred to the Iranian Diabetes Society. The patients were followed for 8 weeks to establish a baseline for normal dietary intake before beginning the CPJ intervention. During the pre-study period a 24-hour food recall and food records (recording flavonoid-rich foods) were completed every 10 days. At the end of the eighth week, anthropometric and biochemical assessments were done. Thereafter the patients consumed 40 g/day of CPJ for 8 weeks, during which time dietary assessment was continued. After completing the study, anthropometric and blood indices were again evaluated. The Wilcoxon signed test was used for statistical analysis. A value of P <.05 was considered significant. Mean (+/-SD) age, weight, and duration of diabetes were 52.5 +/- 5.2 years, 71.5 +/- 10.3 kg, and 7.9 +/- 6.6 years, respectively. After consumption of CPJ, significant reductions were seen in total cholesterol (P <.006), low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (P <.006), LDL-cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (P <.001), and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (P <.001). But, there were no significant changes in serum triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Anthropometric indices, physical activity, kind and doses of oral hypoglycemic agents, and the intakes of nutrients and flavonoid-rich foods showed no change during the CPJ consumption period. It is concluded that CPJ consumption may modify heart disease risk factors in hyperlipidemic patients, and its inclusion therefore in their diets may be beneficial."

            "abstract": "Patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased risk for coronary artery disease due to hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk factors. The diabetic dyslipidemia in these patients is characterized by moderately high levels of (1) serum cholesterol and triglycerides; (2) small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles; and (3) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cho-lesterol concentrations. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of cholesterol-lowering therapy in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients, thus supporting aggressive treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia for coronary artery disease prevention. A 3-step approach is recommended for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia. First, modification of diet and lifestyle, including decreased intakes of cholesterol, cholesterol-raising fats, and total energy, and increased physical activity should be advised. Second, good glycemic control should be achieved with diet and hypoglycemic drugs, if needed. Third, lipid-lowering drugs should be used, if necessary. Non-HDL cholesterol levels, which include both very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL cholesterol, should be the target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (the \"statins\") has become the first-line drug therapy for diabetic dyslipidemia. Bile acid sequestrants are effective cholesterol-lowering agents in normotriglyceridemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia may require fibric acids or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Nicotinic acid worsens hyperglycemia; therefore, it should be avoided in most cases. The efficacy and safety of estrogen-replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with diabetes needs to be determined. The combination of two lipid-lowering agents may be appropriate for some NIDDM patients but should be used judiciously."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether microalbuminuria is part of a cluster of risk factors, the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS), or whether it is only associated with, and presumably a complication of, hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). An age-, sex- and glucose tolerance-stratified random sample from a 50-75 year old general population (n = 622) was investigated. The urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio was measured in an early morning spot urine sample. Microalbuminuria was defined as an albumin-to-creatinine ratio greater than 2.0 mg/ mmol. We considered, as IRS-related variables, fasting hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance (IR; calculated from the formula of the homeostasis model assessment), dyslipidaemia, glucose intolerance, hypertension and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Dyslipidaemia was defined as levels of HDL-cholesterol in the lowest and/or levels of triglyceride in the highest tertile. Fasting insulin levels, IR and WHR were divided into tertiles; the highest tertiles were compared to the lowest tertiles. Age-, sex- and glucose tolerance-adjusted analyses showed microalbuminuria to be significantly associated with hypertension, NIDDM and WHR. In multiple logistic regression analyses, microalbuminuria showed independent associations with hypertension, NIDDM and WHR, with odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) of 3.33 (1.86-5.96), 2.26 (1.14-4.48) and 2.49 (1.09-5.70), respectively. No associations were found with impaired glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, IR or dyslipidaemia. Multiple logistic regression analyses in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects separately showed that microalbuminuria was independently associated only with hypertension (ORs 4.31 and 2.69). In this Caucasian population, microalbuminuria was associated with hypertension, NIDDM and WHR and not with other variables of the IRS.

The classical lipid abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes are low HDL-cholesterol concentration and high triglyceride concentration. Insulin usage leads to a decrease in triglyceride concentration, primarily by its effect on the enzyme adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase. Insulin suppresses the enzyme, thereby controlling lipolysis in uncontrolled diabetes. Insulins therapy also improves the endothelial dysfunction especially in people with evident macrovascular complications. Though insulin is noted to increase adrenergic tone and may cause elevation of blood pressure, still patients with insulinoma do not have high blood pressure. Some studies suggest weight gain with insulin therapy, others contradict it. One study suggests that insulin does not affect treatment satisfaction.

Because the groups did not differ in any of the variables measured, all data were pooled and comparisons were made between baseline and 12 wk. After 12 wk, subjects had a mean weight loss of 7.5 kg (P<0.001), and abdominal fat was reduced by 20% (P<0.001). Plasma LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) were significantly reduced by 8.9 and 38.6%, respectively. Similarly, apolipoproteins C-I (-13.8%), C-III (-21.2%) and E (-12.5%) were significantly lower after the intervention. In contrast plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations were increased by 12% (P<0.05). Changes in plasma TG were positively correlated with reductions in large (r=0.615, P<0.01) and medium VLDL particles (r=0.432, P<0.05) and negatively correlated with LDL diameter (r=-0.489, P<0.01).

It is therefore efficient as a first-line drug in the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM) insufficiently treated with diet alone. Information is scarce whether under acarbose treatment the lipid metabolism can also be improved. Therefore the changes of triglycerides, cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were analyzed in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. In brief, 94 NIDDM aged 43 to 70, after a pretreatment period of at least 3 months, were treated with 100 mg acarbose t.i.d. or placebo for 24 weeks. The patients were recruited after a 4-week screening phase with reinforcement of diet. The most impressive results of acarbose treatment were lowering of blood glucose and insulin, especially in the postprandial state, and of HbA1 (glycosylated hemoglobin). Results on lipids: The initial serum cholesterol levels showed a broad spectrum. Low concentrations remained unchanged under acarbose, while high concentrations (the upper tercile) decreased from 273 to 251 mg/dl. This effect was statistically significant compared to placebo. HDL-cholesterol levels increased continuously under acarbose and placebo as well thus indicating some study effect. Similarly, fasting triglycerides leveled down under acarbose and placebo. However, drastic differences appeared in postprandial triglycerides which were checked 1 and 5 h after a test meal given at entry and at finish of the study. The lowering by acarbose compared to placebo was highly significant for the 1 h postprandial concentrations.

Apolipoprotein AII (apo AII) (28.8 +/- 6.9 mg/dl) in NIDDM with clinical macroangiopathy was significantly lower than that (31.4 +/- 5.5 mg/dl) in control NIDDM, and apo B (147 +/- 48 mg/dl) and apo CIII (13.1 +/- 5.9 mg/dl) in NIDDM with clinical macroangiopathy was significantly higher than that (113 +/- 35 and 10.8 +/- 4.7 mg/dl) in control NIDDM, respectively. There were no significant differences in apo AI, CII, and E levels. The ratio of HDL cholesterol to apo AI (0.36 +/- 0.08) and total cholesterol to apo B (1.6 +/- 0.3) in NIDDM with clinical macroangiopathy was significantly lower than that (0.40 +/- 0.09 and 1.8 +/- 0.4) in control NIDDM. These results suggest that abnormality of lipid metabolism is more significant in NIDDM with clinical macroangiopathy than in NIDDM without clinical macroangiopathy, and is more pronounced in women than in men."

            "abstract": "Consumption of isoflavone-rich soyabean protein is reported to reduce total and LDL-cholesterol, but the specific components responsible are undetermined. In a previous crossover trial we showed that purified isoflavones, derived from red clover (Trifolium pratense), raised HDL3-cholesterol in premenopausal women; however, these findings were inconclusive due to period and carryover effects. In an attempt to overcome this problem, we utilised a parallel study designed to re-examine the effects of purified isoflavones on plasma lipoproteins and markers of insulin resistance in premenopausal women. Twenty-five healthy premenopausal women participated in a double-blind, randomised, parallel study. The treatment group (n 12) consumed a placebo for the first menstrual cycle and an isoflavone supplement (86 mg/d, derived from red clover) for three cycles, while the placebo group (n 13) consumed a placebo supplement for four menstrual cycles. Blood samples were collected weekly during cycles 1, 3 and 4. Supplementation with isoflavones resulted in a 15-fold increase in urinary isoflavone excretion (P<0.0001). There were no significant effects on total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, HDL subfractions, triacylglycerol, lipoprotein(a), glucose or insulin concentrations. Our present results indicate that purified isoflavones derived from red clover have no effect on cholesterol homeostasis or insulin resistance in premenopausal women, a group which is at low risk of CHD."

We therefore investigated the relationship between the waist-to-hip ratio, age, body mass index and serum lipoproteins in 305 probands (158 men, 147 women), while body mass index was kept constant in all age groups. Waist-to-hip ratio correlated with both age (r = 0.441) and body mass index (r = 0.532) in simple linear correlation analysis (P less than 0.001). In stepwise multiple regression analysis we found in both sexes a first step dependence on age for total and LDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.001), a first step dependence on waist-to-hip ratio for triglycerides (P less than 0.001), VLDL-triglycerides (P less than 0.001) and VLDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.001 for men, P less than 0.05 for women), and an inverse first step dependence on body mass index for HDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.05 for men, P less than 0.001 for women). From these results we propose an independent association between waist-to-hip ratio and triglycerides while the relation to total and LDL-cholesterol is determined by age. HDL-cholesterol, on the other hand, is influenced by body fat mass and independent from age or body fat distribution."

GHb was 6.3% in NGT, 7.3% in IGT and 8.11% in NIDDM and was significantly correlated to fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose (p less than 0.001) in NIDDM group and to peak, area (p less than 0.001) and 2-h plasma glucose levels (p less than 0.05) of OGTT in the NGT and IGT groups. Out of the 15 IGT subjects only 6 had GHb levels above the control range, while 9 had normal GHb values. These data show that also in hyperlipemic subjects GHb values are related to glucose tolerance, and suggest that GHb evaluation alone is not sufficient for the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance. In order to evaluate whether plasma turbidity can affect GHb dosage, GHb was evaluated in 10 hyperlipemic subjects with various degrees of hypertriglyceridemia both in the presence (whole blood hemolysate) and absence (isotonic saline hemolysate) of plasma triglycerides. The results show that, with our method, plasma turbidity does not affect GHb evaluation."

OLETF rats were given an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, cilazapril (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle from the age of 5 weeks to 20 weeks. Arteriolar, intermediate and venular capillary proportions were determined by the double-staining method and levels of collagen and non-collagenous proteins were determined by the selective dye-binding method in heart tissues. In OLETF rats at 20 weeks of age, capillary network remodeling (i.e., an increase in arteriolar portions and a decrease in venular portions) and an increase in collagen content were detected. Cilazapril not only exerted favorable effects on markers of diabetes, but also prevented capillary network remodeling and ameliorated the increase in collagen content. These results suggest that 1) capillary network remodeling and increase in extracellular matrix protein levels precede the onset of overt NIDDM in OLETF rats, and 2) angiotensin II may be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac complications in the early stages of NIDDM."

The results demonstrated the presence of statistically significant correlation coefficients between WBC count and both insulin-mediated glucose disposal (r = 0.50, P less than 0.001) and insulin response to oral glucose (r = 0.50, P less than 0.001). Furthermore, WBC count correlated with plasma glucose response to oral glucose (r = 0.48, P less than 0.001), fasting plasma triglyceride (r = 0.37, P less than 0.005) and HDL-cholesterol concentrations (r = -0.38, P less than 0.005), and systolic (r = 0.22, P less than 0.1) and diastolic (r = 0.27, P less than 0.05) blood pressure. However, the only two variables significantly correlated with WBC count in multivariate regression analysis were insulin resistance (r = 0.49, P less than 0.01) and insulin response (r = 0.35, P less than 0.05). These data indicate that WBC count is significantly correlated with changes in carbohydrate and lipoprotein metabolism and blood pressure that increase the risk of CHD. However, it appears that these relationships are secondary to resistance to insulin-mediated glucose uptake and hyperinsulinaemia."

This study was designed to investigate the relationship of changes in homocysteine (Hcy) induced by oral folate to glutathione and measures of glycaemia and lipid metabolism in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Twenty-seven patients (26 male, 1 female, aged 48-68 years) with T2DM and microalbuminuria were treated with folic acid 10 mg daily for 3 months. During the study, diastolic blood pressure (p=0.04), HbA1c (p=0.04), serum triglycerides (p=0.04) and serum total/HDL-cholesterol ratio (p=0.004) all increased and serum HDL-cholesterol fell (p=0.006). The increased red cell folate correlated with a reduction in microalbuminuria (p=0.001). Overall, plasma glutathione increased (p=0.016) despite reduction in its precursor Hcy (p<0.001). Change in glutathione correlated inversely with change in HbA1c (p<0.02), total cholesterol (p=0.003) and triglycerides (p<0.02) and positively with HDL-cholesterol (p=0.033). Increase in glutathione correlated with levels of vitamin B6 (p<0.05). Metformin treatment protected against the rise in blood pressure (BP) (p=0.02), independently of changes in plasma glutathione. In summary, oral folic acid supplementation in T2DM reduced plasma Hcy and increased glutathione levels. HbA1c, triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol deteriorated during the trial: their levels correlated inversely with changes in glutathione. The increase in glutathione may depend on an adequate supply of B6, as changes in glutathione correlated with vitamin B6 levels. Reduced Hcy and increased glutathione may both mediate improvement in vascular function and outcome. Some aspects of the response to folate may be different in patients on metformin."

Consequently, the risk for acquiring coronary heart disease (CHD) in the next 8 yr calculated by the Framingham logistic regression equation shows a marked increase in risk for both men and women with diabetes (relative risk = 1.3 and 1.9, respectively). This calculated risk for CHD incidence predicts actual deaths from CHD, cardiovascular disease, and all causes in diabetic individuals in the succeeding 15 yr. Baseline levels of cholesterol, blood pressure, and smoking in the NIDDM population were hypothetically reduced according to results achieved in recent coronary-risk intervention trials. Average population risk for CHD incidence was recalculated and compared with new risk estimates calculated by hypothetically eliminating diabetes in various proportions of the population. Crude estimates suggest that realistic attempts to lower one, two, or three coronary risk factors in the population would reduce calculated CHD risk equivalent to eliminating diabetes in 20, 40, and 60% of the population, respectively."

After passage through the aortas the concentration of LDL-cholesterol was significantly decreased in the perfusates, whereas the HDL-cholesterol level was unchanged. In comparison to controls, perfused with lipoprotein free solution, the concentration of 6-oxo-PGF1 alpha was significantly decreased more than 50% by LDL and the TXB2 level was enhanced significantly by approximately 50%. This results in a significant rise of the TXB2/6-oxo-PGF1 alpha ratio in the perfusates. HDL did not significantly change the ratio of these eicosanoids in the perfusates. These results suggest that this concentration of LDL enhanced the formation of the proaggregatory TXA2 and decreased the formation of the antiaggregatory PGI2 in rat aortas perfused under pulsatile pressure.

The relationship between changes in the measurements between 1 and 4 yr of follow-up (N = 34) revealed the following significant (P < 0.05) correlations: i) changes in VO2max with changes in percent body fat (r = -0.289) and changes in plasma triglycerides (r = -0.354), ii) changes in LTPA with changes in percent body fat (-0.361), and iii) changes in percent body fat with changes in the total/high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio (0.358), HDL-cholesterol (-0.212), and triglycerides (0.289). Multiple regression analysis revealed that changes in percent body fat affected changes in plasma triglycerides (P < 0.05). The effects of chronic physical activity on plasma triglycerides appear to result from exercise-related effects on body adiposity. These findings support the role of regular physical activity as mandated by Healthy People 2000 for CAD risk reduction."

Blood glucose levels remained unchanged in both normoglycemic patients and those with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) during 3 years of therapy. It is concluded that isradipine is safe and effective when administered long-term in the treatment of hypertensive patients with either hyperlipidemia or NIDDM."

Participants were first randomly assigned to either receive their preferred diet or be assigned to a diet group and second, were given their diet of preference or randomly assigned to a standard weight-loss diet or a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet. Participants underwent a university-based weight-control program consisting of daily dietary and exercise goals plus 12 months of behavioral counseling followed by a 6-month maintenance phase.\n## MEASUREMENTS\nPercentage change in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, low- and high-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin and macronutrient intake.\n## RESULTS\nThe program was completed by 132 (75%) of the participants. At 18 months, mean percentage weight loss was greater (P=0.01) in the two groups that were assigned a diet (standard, 8.0% (s.d., 7.8%); vegetarian, 7.9% (s.d., 8.1%)) than in those provided the diet of their choice (standard, 3.9% (s.d., 6.1%); vegetarian, 5.3% (s.d., 6.2%)). No difference was observed in weight loss between the two types of diet. Over the 18-month program, all groups showed significant weight loss.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nParticipants assigned to their dietary preference did not have enhanced treatment outcomes. However, all groups lost weight with losses ranging from 4 to 8% at 18 months.\n"

            "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that alterations in metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are of importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences. Particles with the characteristics of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remnants have been related to the extent and severity of atherosclerosis in humans and in animal models. These particles can be identified using ultracentrifugal procedures as small, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) with Svedberg flotation rates (Sf) of 12-60. Postprandial triglyceride levels also have been related to risk of coronary artery disease, consistent with a pathologic role for remnant lipoproteins. In studies in which measurements of lipoprotein subfractions have been carried out, levels of IDL have been more predictive than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of atherosclerosis progression as assessed by coronary artery angiography or carotid artery ultrasonography. These findings suggest that a considerable portion of the coronary disease risk attributed to LDL may be accounted for by the IDL particles included in standard LDL measurements. Other metabolic changes associated with increased levels of plasma triglyceride may also adversely affect cardiovascular disease risk. These include reductions in HDL-cholesterol and apoprotein A1, increased levels of small dense LDL particles, redistribution of apoC-III from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins, diminished insulin sensitivity, and procoagulant changes, including increased levels of the fibrinolysis inhibitor, plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). A predominance of small dense LDL (subclass pattern B) is a discrete marker for this cluster of interrelated abnormalities and is found in 40-50% of patients with coronary artery disease. Therapeutic interventions with favorable effects on components of this dysmetabolic profile appear to be of value in decreasing atherosclerosis risk in a substantial proportion of the population."

Given that pharmacotherapy has limited available options and that bariatric surgery is reserved for those who are morbidly obese or who have significant comorbidities, the most common approach to the treatment of obesity is standard behavioral treatment. This approach includes behavior modification related to eating and activity habits. The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale, design, methods and baseline sample characteristics of a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention in weight loss management, referred to as the PREFER study.\n## METHODS\nThe PREFER study, using a four-group design, includes: (1) a randomization scheme that permits participants to indicate a preferred dietary treatment approach, and (2) two dietary options, one of which is a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet that has demonstrated potential for long-term adherence. The intervention (32 treatment sessions) is delivered over 12 months and is followed by a 6-month maintenance phase; final assessment occurs at 18 months.\n## RESULTS\nWe screened 932 individuals and randomized 197 to the study: Treatment Preference-Yes (n=84) and Treatment Preference-No (n=98). To maintain a balance across the four treatment groups, 15 subjects who preferred the standard diet had to be discarded from the Treatment Preference-Yes group. Retention at 18 months for the first of three cohorts was 82%.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe PREFER study is a single center study and is the first randomized controlled trial examining a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet as part of weight loss treatment. The ethnically diverse sample includes males and females with a body mass index of 27 to 43. The study has the potential to make a contribution to understanding the role of treatment preference and the potential of a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet for long-term weight loss.\n"

A random sample of non-diabetic control subjects was also examined. Diabetic patients had both at diagnosis and after five years higher total, LDL- and VLDL-triglyceride levels and higher VLDL-cholesterol, but lower HDL-cholesterol levels than non-diabetic subjects. No consistent difference was found in LDL-cholesterol levels between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The prevalence of microalbuminuria (greater than 35 mg/24h) remained about the same in diabetic patients at both examinations (19-20%). The diabetic patients with persistent microalbuminuria were slightly hyperglycaemic and they tended to have lower creatinine clearance at the 5-year examination than those without persistent microalbuminuria. There were no differences in the blood pressure levels or the occurrence of hypertension between the diabetic groups with and without microalbuminuria. At the baseline examination, no differences were seen in serum lipids and lipoproteins between diabetic patients with and without microalbuminuria. In patients with persistent microalbuminuria, a statistically significant increase in VLDL-cholesterol (p less than 0.05) and VLDL- and LDL-triglyceride levels (p less than 0.05) and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol level (p less than 0.05) was seen at the 5-year follow-up.

Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GhRH) analogues are widely used in assisted reproduction programs. Therefore, it seems important to evaluate possible changes in serum lipoprotein levels following treatment with these compounds.\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Our purpose was to assess possible lipoprotein changes following administration of the long-acting GnRH analogue, D-Trp6 luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH).\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      Serum levels of cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglicerydes were determined before and after 6 weeks of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No significant changes in either cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, or triglicerydes following treatment with D-Trp6 LH-RH were demonstrated in the group of 25 patients investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Short-term use of D-Trp6 LH-RH is not associated with any significant change in plasma lipid levels. Further studies are still required with patients undergoing repeated treatment cycles, especially those who exhibit elevated pretreatment plasma lipid levels, to confirm the long-term safety of GnRH analogues with respect to lipid metabolism."

            "abstract": "On 197 patients who were admitted to a sanatorium for the purpose of a heart and circulation cure the influence of a daily swimming training, 20-30 minutes 6 times a week with intensities of about 50-60% VO2 max, on the lipid and lipoprotein spectre, respectively was investigated. In the whole group of patients HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) did not change. In patients with increased risk n = 40 (initial HDL-C: lower than 0.91 mmol/l) HDL-C significantly increased in the course of the cure. In group I n = 157 (without increase of HDL-C) as well as in group II n = 40 (with increase of HDL-C) LDL-cholesterol significantly decreased. The lipid index after Klimov and the quotient LDL-C/HDL-C decreased at the end of the treatment and they showed the most distinct change in group II. The separation of the lipoproteins by disc electrophoresis and the establishment of their percental distribution resulted in a decrease of the beta-lipoproteins and an increase of the alpha-lipoproteins for the two groups (I and II). The quotient beta-lipoprotein/alpha-lipoprotein also significantly decreased in the two groups. For the apolipoproteins A and B in group II no statistically ascertained changes of concentration were established. At the end of the treatment in group I apolipoprotein B highly significantly decreased, while apolipoprotein A did not change. In accordance with the cholesterol index also the reduction of the apolipoprotein index apo B/A was significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

From these data, the LDL-cholesterol and the atherosclerosis indices (LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A) were determined. The following results were obtained: the parameters of lipid-metabolism recognized as risk factors for vascular complications such as triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, were the same as those obtained from a control group of healthy children in the same age. Using HbA1 as the basis for the observations, the risk factors were reduced by normalisation of glucose metabolism. On the other hand, the apolipoprotein A and HDL-cholesterol, well known as protective factors against atherosclerosis, are higher than in the control group and show a further increase with metabolic normalisation. The conclusion is: If medical therapy, metabolic rate, diet, physical exercise and special training are better controlled, the risk of diabetes developing macroangiopathy can be diminished."

Even after adjustment of duration the clustering of vascular complication in the subjects with CHD was striking. Presence of low HDL cholesterol was significant in both men and women diabetics with CHD (p < 0.01); while hypertension and poor metabolic control showed a strong positive correlation to CHD in women (p < 0.01 & p < 0.05). Multiple logistic analysis carried out separately in men and women showed that both low HDL cholesterol and elevated serum triglycerides showed strong association to CHD in both sexes; while in women in addition hypertension and insulin therapy also had a positive correlation to CHD (p < 0.01). Furthermore the influence of known duration of diabetes was not observed to be a significant contributor to the cardiovascular risk factors, since the above mentioned risk factors remained statistically significant in the subsample of patients with duration of diabetes less than 15 years."

            "abstract": "Established drugs used in the treatment of hypertension have reduced stroke but have had disappointingly little impact on coronary artery disease and its complications. This could be due to inadequate falls in blood pressure (or excessive falls). It is possible that the role of blood pressure in ischaemic heart disease has been over-estimated compared to other risk factors. Alternatively, the drugs used previously may have adversely affected other factors. Mortality in treated hypertensives remains higher than normotensives but so does their blood pressure. The blood pressure on treatment is a much better predictor of outcome than initial blood pressure. This suggests that improved blood pressure control may be desirable. In our hospital-based hypertension clinic many patients have more than one risk factor. In spite of intensive efforts between 1980 and 1988, smoking habits changed little and serum cholesterol and random blood glucose actually rose. Cholesterol is high in our population of hypertensive patients and the mean (+/- SD) rose from 6.4 +/- 1.3 to 6.6 +/- 1.3 (n = 127; P less than 0.01). These observations highlight the importance of a multiple risk factor approach. The benefits of alternative drugs which can lower total cholesterol and/or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and/or raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) deserve study in this population. A final possibility is that the widely observed association between hypertension and ischaemic heart disease is not causal (or is weak compared to other risk factors). If a common underlying mechanism caused both atheroma and hypertension then reduction of blood pressure would not be expected to reverse atheroma and its complications. At present this possibility cannot be excluded."

Hyperglycemia, dyslipoproteinemia, arterial hypertension and coagulation abnormalities are the most important cardiovascular risk factors. Hypertriglyceridemia and low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) seem to be related with insulin resistance. Fibric acid derivates (fibrates) are effective in the treatment of dyslipoproteinemia in diabetes. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ciprofibrate in improving dyslipoproteinemia and its effect on fibrinogen plasma concentrations, carbohydrate metabolism variations and insulin action.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      13 subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus were treated with diet and placebo for 4 weeks and then randomized to one of two treatments: ciprofibrate 100 mg or placebo for four weeks.

Total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDLc), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDLc), HDLc, Apolipoprotein B100, fibrinogen, insulin and Lp(a) were measured. Insulin erythrocytes union was made by the Gambhir method.

This formed the basis for the extraction of 7 'factors' by the statistical procedure 'factor analysis'. Analysis of variance was performed with the 'factor scores' for subgroups of high and low age and high and low total serum cholesterol. The analysis revealed two unexpected factors which discriminated with statistical significance between young, hypercholesterolaemic patients and controls. One factor was a positive risk factor and the other a negative one. They could possibly be dependent on the existence of two at present uncharacterized subgroups of lipoproteins. These lipoproteins contained, according to the analysis, large amounts of certain fatty acids.

The purpose of this study was to determine if waist to hip ratio is associated with the concentration of plasma lipids and apolipoproteins (apoproteins) that predispose individuals to a higher CHD risk. Plasma lipids and apoprotein concentrations were determined in 100 male volunteers, ranging in age from 19-68 yr, and WHR ranging from 0.89-1.09. Significant positive associations were found between WHR, plasma glucose (r = 0.25, P = 0.01), cholesterol (r = 0.21, P = 0.04), LDL cholesterol (r = 0.22, P = 0.03), triglycerides (r = 0.25, P = 0.01) and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.30, P = 0.002). Negative associations were found between WHR and HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.19, P = 0.05), plasma apoprotein A-I (4 = -0.28, P = 0.005) and the ratio of plasma apoprotein A-I to apoprotein B (r = -0.26, P = 0.01). To determine the extent to which these correlations were independent of age and body fat content, a subsample of 15 pairs matched on age and percent body fat, but differing in WHR was selected from the larger sample. In the group with high WHR (1.06) HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I levels were lower and apo B higher than in the group with low WHR (0.96). Total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol levels in the group with high WHR were also higher but marginally significant statistically. These results show that WHR is associated with plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations that are more predisposing to CHD and that males with male type obesity may be at a higher risk of CHD development than those with female type, regardless of age or degree of obesity."

            "abstract": "The concept that androgen alone can provide an effective male contraceptive has been tested in a multicentre, multiphase trial by the World Health Organization. Results from this trial showed that an ester of testosterone, testosterone enanthate (TE), administered at a dose of 200 mg/week, has a very high contraceptive efficacy, and suggested that, at least in some populations, androgen alone might provide a viable option for the control of male fertility. It has been claimed that testosterone represents one of the gender-related risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) in men. Epidemiological and interventional studies have failed to establish a convincing relationship between testosterone and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Therefore, there is concern about possible negative effects on lipoprotein asset of an androgen-alone male contraceptive. In this study we analysed the effects of long-term (12 months) administration of TE (200 mg/week) in normal healthy men. Blood samples (six men > 10 h fast = Group 1; 30 men > 4 h fast = Group 2) were drawn from 36 men, monthly before the beginning of the injections (control), every 3 months throughout the study period (treatment), and 1 month after stopping TE injections (recovery). Total cholesterol (chol), triglycerides, HDL-C and LDL-C levels were measured in these samples. Biochemical parameters were also monitored. TE administration induced a significant decrease (15-20%) in HDL-C levels that was of comparable magnitude in men from both groups (fasting and non-fasting) and occurred regardless of basal HDL-C levels. No statistically significant effect on other lipoproteins was detected. Considering all men together, HDL-C levels were decreased in 78% of the men by month 3, 83% by month 6, 94% by month 9 and 97% by month 12 of treatment. In all men the HDL-C decrease was reversible within 1 month of stopping TE administration. It is concluded that: (1) injection of 200 mg TE/week causes a 15-20% decrease in HDL-C in normal men with no effect on other lipoproteins, (2) the suppressive effect of TE is maintained throughout the 1-year-injection period, and a direct relationship between the duration of TE administration and the proportion of men showing decreased HDL-C levels, was observed. (3) The HDL-C decrease was reversible within 1 month of stopping TE administration. These data will be important in designing further studies on male contraception, and in interpreting the relationship between testosterone levels, HDL-C levels and potential cardiovascular risk."

Here, we aimed to compare the effect of a vegan diet and conventional diabetic diet on glycemic control among Korean individuals.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants diagnosed with T2D were randomly assigned to follow either a vegan diet (excluding animal-based food including fish; n = 46) or a conventional diet recommended by the Korean Diabetes Association 2011 (n = 47) for 12 weeks. HbA1c levels were measured at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and the primary study endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels over 12 weeks.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean HbA1c levels at weeks 0, 4, and 12 were 7.7%, 7.2%, and 7.1% in the vegan group, and 7.4%, 7.2%, and 7.2% in the conventional group, respectively. Although both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1C levels, the reductions were larger in the vegan group than in the conventional group (-0.5% vs. -0.2%; p-for-interaction = 0.017). When only considering participants with high compliance, the difference in HbA1c level reduction between the groups was found to be larger (-0.9% vs. -0.3%). The beneficial effect of vegan diets was noted even after adjusting for changes in total energy intake or waist circumference over the 12 weeks.\n## CONCLUSION\nBoth diets led to reductions in HbA1c levels; however, glycemic control was better with the vegan diet than with the conventional diet. Thus, the dietary guidelines for patients with T2D should include a vegan diet for the better management and treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of a vegan diet, and to identify potential explanations of the underlying mechanisms.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nCRiS KCT0001771.\n"

            "abstract": "It is widely known that atherosclerosis through its complication, i.e. heart and brain infarction, is at the present the main cause of death. The atherosclerotic process has been shown in correlation with hyperlipemia especially as far as the plasma lipoprotein cholesterol level is concerned. A preminent role in removing cholesterol from tissues and arterial walls then in preventing atherosclerosis is played by a specific class of plasma lipoproteins, the high density lipoproteins (HDL). Since the HDL-colesterol level seems to have an inverse correlation with the atherosclerotic disease it is of primary importance to define a reliable and reproducible technique to measure it. One of the aims of this paper was to examine the different methods now available for such a determination. This analysis has underlined the discrepancy among the reference values reported in the literature. However, all the authors agree that only the simultaneous measurement of total and HDL-colesterol levels is of prognostic value. Personal studies are here reported on the relationship between total and HDL-colesterol levels and risk factor of cardiovascular diseases. The two mentioned laboratory analyses have been performed on blood samples from 250 between male and female human subjects of different age. The obtained results show that the highest HDL-colesterol concentrations determined by a lipoprotein precipitation procedure with dextran sulphate, are typical in the first ten years of life both in male and in female, while the lowest levels of plasma HDL-cholesterol have been evintiated during the fifth decade of life, when the total cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular complications rich the highest values. In a following set of investigations, the already examined blood parameters together with the risk factor values have been examined in two groups of subjects, the first one represented by adult healthy persons the second one by patients of similar age from a cardiovascular division. The mean levels of total colesterol have been shown similar in both the experimental groups, while plasma HDL-cholesterol is significantly higher in the healthy group. This discrepancy is the cause of definitively higher risk factors in the hospitalized patients. In conclusion, the reported data furtherly stress that the total cholesterol values do not give \"per se\" any indication of atherogenic risk. They are useful only when examined together with the HDL-cholesterol levels. From that the opportunity to always include the determination of plasma HDL-cholesterol screening lipemic profiles."

The study used the MJ Health Screening database, with data collected from 1994 to 2008 in Taiwan, which included 4415 lacto-ovo-vegetarians, 1855 lacto-vegetarians and 1913 vegans; each vegetarian was matched with five non-vegetarians based on age, sex and study site. In the longitudinal follow-up, each additional year of vegan diet lowered the risk of obesity by 7 % (95 % CI 0·88, 0·99), whereas each additional year of lacto-vegetarian diet lowered the risk of elevated SBP by 8 % (95 % CI 0·85, 0·99) and elevated glucose by 7 % (95 % CI 0·87, 0·99), and each additional year of ovo-lacto-vegetarian diet increased abnormal HDL by 7 % (95 % CI 1·03, 1·12), compared with non-vegetarians. In the cross-sectional comparisons, all sub-types of vegetarians had lower likelihoods of abnormalities compared with non-vegetarians on all metabolic traits (P<0·001 for all comparisons), except for HDL and TAG. The better metabolic profile in vegetarians is partially attributable to lower BMI. With proper management of TAG and HDL, along with caution about the intake of refined carbohydrates and fructose, a plant-based diet may benefit all aspects of the metabolic profile."

All these factors were then considered simultaneously using multiple logistic models. Definite myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram and recall of a doctor diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease remained predictive of subsequent major ischaemic heart disease, after allowance for all other risk factors. Serum total cholesterol, blood pressure, and cigarette smoking each remained as highly significant independent risk factors whereas overweight, above average levels of HDL-cholesterol and serum triglyceride were not predictive of risk after allowance for the above factors. Men with and without pre-existing ischaemic heart disease were examined separately in the same way (using multiple logistic models). The strength of association between the principal risk factors and subsequent major ischaemic heart disease was reduced in the men with pre-existing ischaemic heart disease, only age and serum total cholesterol remaining highly significant. Overall the levels of the major risk factors commonly encountered in British men have a marked effect on the risk of ischaemic heart disease. Modification of these risk factors in the general population constitutes an important national priority."

The most effective method to reduce plasma Lp(a) concentration significantly is therapeutic apheresis, namely, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) apheresis. A novel technique based on reusable LDL adsorber called Lipocollect 200 (Medicollect, Rimbach, Germany) allows the removal of both LDL and Lp(a) from plasma. Two male patients with hyperLp(a)lipoproteinemia and angiographically established progressive coronary heart disease, without rough elevation of LDL-cholesterol, who did not respond to diet and medication were submitted to 50 LDL Lp(a) aphereses with Lipocollect 200 LDL Lp(a)-adsorber at weekly and biweekly intervals. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol plasma levels fell significantly by 48.3% (+/-6.7) to 61.6% (+/-12.7) (first patient), and 42.5% (+/-6.3) to 60.6% (+/-14.3) (second patient), respectively (all differences: P < or = 0.001). High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration in plasma did not show statistically significant change. Plasma triglycerides were also significantly reduced by 43.6% (+/-24.4) (first patient) and 42.3% (+/-13) (second patient) (both differences: P < or = 0.001). Plasma Lp(a) showed a statistically significant percent reduction in plasma as expected: 64.7 +/- 9.5 (first patient), and 59.1 +/- 6.7 (second patient) (both differences: P < or = 0.001). Plasma fibrinogen concentration was decreased by 35.9% (+/-18.7) (P < or = 0.05) (first patient) and 41.8% (+/-11.5) (second patient) (P < or = 0.005). Considering the reduction rate between the first and the last procedures, we have compared the mean percent reduction of the first five treatments (from session #1 to #5) with the last five treatments (from session #21 to #25). We have observed an increasing reduction of all activity parameters on both patients apart from HDL-cholesterol (first patient) and triglyceride (second patient) that showed a decreasing reduction rate. Both patients followed the prescribed schedule and completed the study. Clinically, all sessions were well tolerated and undesired reactions were not reported. The Lipocollect 200 adsorber proved to have a good biocompatibility. In this study, the adsorber reusability for several sessions was confirmed."

            "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in most developed countries. Most CVD deaths are preventable through life-style measures such as diet, exercise and avoidance of cigarette smoking. Decreased intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and increased intake of cholesterol-reducing foods, such as pulses, deserve a high priority for activities designed to prevent CVD. Epidemiological and observational studies indicate that habitual intakes of large amounts of dietary fibre or of vegetables are associated with significantly lower rates of CVD. Studies over four decades document the hypocholesterolaemic effect of pulses and soyabeans. We performed a meta-analysis of eleven clinical trials that examined the effects of pulses (not including soyabeans) on serum lipoproteins. Intake of non-soya pulses was associated with these changes: fasting serum cholesterol, -7.2 %, 95 % CI -5.8, -8.6 %; LDL-cholesterol, -6.2 %, 95 % CI -2.8, -9.5 %; HDL-cholesterol, +2.6 %, 95 % CI +6.3, -1.0 %; triacylglycerols, -16.6 %, 95 % CI -11.8 %, -21.5 %; and body weight, -0.9 %, 95 % CI +2.2 %, -4.1 %. The hypocholesterolaemic effects of pulses appear related, in estimated order of importance, to these factors: soluble dietary fibre, vegetable protein, oligosaccharides, isoflavones, phospholipids and fatty acids, saponins and other factors. Intake of pulses may also reduce risk for CVD by favourable effects on blood pressure, glycaemia and risk for diabetes, and risk for obesity. Overall, the available evidence indicates that regular consumption of pulses may have important protective effects on risk for CVD."

The plasma apo A-I and B levels were measured by a radial immunodiffusion assay that made use of well characterized monoclonal antibodies. Univariate statistical analysis showed that the mean values for HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I were significantly lower in patients with single-, double- and triple-vessel disease than in the control subjects. The mean values for plasma cholesterol and apo B were significantly higher in the group with double- and triple-, but not single-vessel disease, than in the group without CAD. No statistically significant difference among groups was found for plasma triglyceride values. Since the considered variables failed to assess the severity of the disease, as determined by the number of vessels involved, the 3 groups of patients with CAD were combined into one group. A multiple logistic analysis, performed in order to assess the independent role of the variables and to estimate the corresponding odds ratio, indicated an independent association of HDL-cholesterol, apo A-I and apo B with CAD. When the multiple logistic analysis was repeated with a stepwise procedure, only apo A-I and B entered into the model. The results of our study indicate that plasma levels of apo A-I and B are more useful than plasma lipid in detecting the presence or absence of coronary artery disease in a group of male patients undergoing coronary angiography."

All women were examined before and after 3 months of treatment. Compared with the regularly menstruating women, the PCO women had significantly higher body weights and blood pressure as well as elevated levels of triglycerides in serum and VLDL. During treatment, 14 out of 20 women affected by PCO lost weight. No significant change in blood pressure was observed. In the PCO group, moderate increments were encountered in serum cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides. No significant changes were seen in LDL-cholesterol or HDL-cholesterol. The ratio LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol did not alter. The level of total cholesterol in VLDL rose during treatment. These changes in serum and lipoprotein lipids in PCO patients were of the same type and magnitude as those found in the control group, apart from an increase in HDL-cholesterol in the latter. The only remaining difference after treatment was a slightly higher level of VLDL triglycerides in the PCO women. Thus only moderate changes were induced in lipid and lipoprotein patterns by the combination of desogestrel and EE. A \"positive\" influence on lipids and lipoproteins cannot be considered as a further advantage, added to the list of indications when hormonal treatment is used in PCO-affected women.

We compared 16 patients with MHT to 41 patients with untreated NMHT and 45 normotensive controls. LDL subfraction profile was measured by disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a validated scoring system to calculate the mean size (locus) and heterogeneity (spread) of LDL subfraction mobilities. A higher LDL locus indicates a greater proportion of small LDL subfractions. LDL cholesterol levels were similar in all three groups (p=0.23). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly lower (p<0.001) and serum triglyceride concentrations significantly higher (p=0.02) in the MHT group, compared to normotensive controls.

In addition to analyzing fasting plasma lipids (cholesterol and triglyceride), we used two chemical techniques to measure the three major classes of lipoproteins: ultracentrifugation with heparin/manganese precipitation which yielded values for HDL-, LDL- and VLDL-cholesterol, and quantitative electrophoresis which yielded values for alpha-, beta- and pre-beta-lipoprotein. Both measures of the cholesterol-rich lipoprotein class (LDL-cholesterol and beta-lipoprotein) were related to CHD prevalence, but neither appeared to be superior to total serum cholesterol in the strength--approximately twofold--of the association. Both measures of the protein-rich lipoprotein class (HDL-cholesterol and alpha-lipoprotein) showed a two-fold inverse association with CHD, although the latter did not attain statistical significance. No member of the triglyceride-rich class (pre-beta-lipoprotein, VLDL-cholesterol, or serum triglyceride itself) was independently associated with CHD. We conclude that plasma total cholesterol remains a good single test for most clinical situations because of the prognostic information it contains, its widespread availability and its role in treatment decisions; also that either the plasma alpha-lipoprotein or HDL-cholesterol level can provide additional information on the likelihood of disease."

The combination of LDL-cholesterol, apoA-I and VLDL-cholesterol was the best model in predicting cardiovascular disease. ApoE phenotype group E3/E2 had significantly lower values for serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apoB and higher levels of apoE in comparison with the phenotype groups E3/E3 and E4/E3. The combination of LDL-cholesterol, cholesterol, apoE and VLDL-triglycerides was the best model in predicting the apoE phenotype. Thus, taking other risk factors into account, the apoE phenotype is not an independent risk factor for CAD; the apoE polymorphism influences lipoprotein levels and possibly, in that way, indirectly also the risk for CAD."

            "abstract": "Data of 52 patients, 29 women and 23 men aged 32-68 years (mean age 47 years) with essential hypertension, participating in three open therapeutic trials with either enalapril, lisinopril, or perindopril were evaluated to assess the effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on glucose and lipid metabolism. The 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) was performed, and plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides levels were determined before and after the 8- to 12-week treatment. Minor differences in the blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect and metabolic response were obtained with the ACE inhibitors studied; only lisinopril improved glucose tolerance significantly; blood lipids were not changed by any drug. The entire patient population showed only a slight reduction in 1-h postload glucose after treatment. More obvious improvement in glucose tolerance was evident in hypertensive patients who were glucose intolerant and/or insulin resistant (GI/IR, 53.8% of all), however. This subgroup also showed a slight but not significant increase in HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in triglycerides levels. Only a slight change or no change in plasma glucose, insulin, and lipid values was noted in hypertensive patients with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and insulin sensitivity. These favorable effects were expressed only after ACE inhibitor monotherapy, but not when hydrochlorothiazide was added. The results indicate that a lack of stratification of hypertensive patients with regard to glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity could be a confounding factor in evaluation of metabolic effects of ACE inhibitors."

MCh induced increments in LBF were approximately 40% and 55% lower in OB and NIDDM, respectively, as compared with C (P < 0.05). Euglycemic hyperinsulinemia augmented the LBF response to MCh by - 50% in C (P < 0.05 vs saline) but not in OB and NIDDM. SNP caused comparable increments in LBF in all groups. Regression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation between the maximal LBF change in response to MCh and body fat content. Thus, obesity/insulin resistance is associated with (a) blunted endothelium-dependent, but normal endothelium-independent vasodilation and (b) failure of euglycemic hyperinsulinemia to augment endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Therefore, obese/insulin-resistant subjects are characterized by endothelial dysfunction and endothelial resistance to insulin's effect on enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. This endothelial dysfunction could contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis in obese insulin-resistant subjects."

Serum protein electrophoresis was also carried out. Compared to the control group, in addicted males with NIDDM, HbA1c, K(+) and Fe(2+) were higher, and serum total protein, ALT and HDL-c were lower. No significant difference was observed between other factors. Albumin was lower in addicts, but no significant difference was observed between the albumin/globulin ratios.

Cholesterol tends to be lower in diabetic addicted males, HbA1c in addicted females and uric acid in addicted males was higher compared to non-addicted diabetics. Their differences, however, were not significant. According to our results, smoking opium increases serum glucose and decreases HDL-c, and thus adds to metabolic disorders in NIDDM patients.

            "abstract": "For the past 40 years, adrenoreceptors have been studied as the biomolecular mediators of tissue response to catecholamines. An expanded role of alpha-adrenoreceptors in the regulation of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) has recently emerged. Hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, and cigarette smoking are the major risk factors and their interactions are associated with increased mortality. Control of hypertension alone has failed to reduce the risk of CHD. Conversely, reduction of elevated total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol has been shown to lower the risk of CHD. As a result, multiple risk factor approaches to the management of patients have evolved in attempts to reduce deaths from CHD. Selective alpha 1-adrenoreceptor antagonists appear to have a dual function in CHD risk management since they control elevated blood pressure by peripheral vasodilatation and reduce atherogenic lipids by several mechanisms. With selective alpha 1-blockade, the number of LDL-cholesterol receptors is up-regulated and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG Co-A reductase) activity is suppressed causing reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apoprotein B levels. Effects on intermediary metabolism reduce synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) which contributes to a reduction of total triglyceride levels and, to a lesser extent, to a reduction of total cholesterol levels. Increased lipoprotein lipase activity leads to reduced total triglyceride and VLDL levels and to increased high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. As demonstrated by the initial prospective data from Phase I of the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), both reduction of raised blood pressure and beneficial lipid modifications are sustained (1 year) with selective alpha 1-blockade. The prospective benefits on morbidity and mortality from CHD of such favourable changes in these two major risk factors remain to be quantified."

Although the causes for these differences in CHD mortality and morbidity in the Finnish population are unknown, it offers an excellent opportunity to investigate the effects of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) on CHD risk in two populations differing significantly with respect to the occurrence of CHD. Therefore, we carried out a 7-year prospective population-based study including a large number of patients with NIDDM (East Finland: 253 men and 257 women; West Finland: 328 men, 221 women) and corresponding non-diabetic subjects (East Finland: 313 men, 336 women; West Finland: 325 men, 399 women). In both study populations the presence of NIDDM increased significantly the risk for CHD events (CHD mortality or all CHD events including CHD mortality or non-fatal myocardial infarction). Diabetic men had 3-4 fold higher and diabetic women 8-11-fold higher risk for CHD than corresponding non-diabetic subjects. Both non-diabetic and diabetic subjects had odds ratios (East vs West) for CHD events of about 2 indicating a similar East-West difference in the CHD risk. Regional difference was quite similar in men and women. These results imply that factors related to NIDDM, independently of conventional risk factors and the occurrence of atherothrombosis in the background population, must play a major role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease in NIDDM diabetes."

In fact most of the studies have involved equine oestrogen (Premarin) taken orally. The effects of oestrogens and the progestins depend on the type of administration (oral or percutaneous administration) and the variety of the drug chosen and finally is also dose dependent. The most favourable effect is obtained in normolipidaemic women with the combination of conjugated oestrogens given orally and a non-androgenic progestins. Such therapy is associated with an increase in HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in LDL-cholesterol. HDL subfraction analysis shows that HDL2 are the main species involved in this increase. The mechanism of action of oestrogens and progestins can be summarized as follows: oestrogens stimulate hepatic triglyceride secretion, inhibit the action of hepatic lipase, augment LDL breakdown via the cellular receptor apo B-E and may decrease LDL oxidability and Lp(a) levels. Although several points remain obscure, we may notice that most of studies show that the atherogenic profile of the women who are currently being treated tends to improve."

After 5 years 431 men and 320 women received a complex check up with oral glucose tolerance tests and measurements of plasma insulin and glucose levels, fasting and 2h post-load. Regarding the metabolic parameters, the fasting and postprandial insulin levels were higher among the patients having coronary heart disease (15% of men, 36% of women), as compared to patients without this disease.

The beneficial effect of dietary fiber in the management of type II diabetes, has not been totally demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to determine the plasma-lowering effects of 5.1g b.i.d. of psyllium husk fiber, as an adjunct to dietary and drug therapy on lipid and glucose levels, in patients with type II diabetes. Patients were randomly selected from an outpatient clinic of primary care to participate in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in which Plantago ovata Forsk., or placebo was given in combination with their anti-diabetic drugs. Forty-nine subjects were included in the study that were given diet counseling before the study and then followed for 8 weeks in the treatment period. Fasting plasma glucose (FBS) was measured every 2 weeks, and total plasma cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and insulin levels were measured every 4 weeks. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was also measured at the beginning and ending of the study. The test products (psyllium or placebo) were supplied to subjects in identically labeled foil packets containing a 5.1g dose of product, to consume two doses per day, half an hour before breakfast and dinner. Both products were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events related to treatment was reported in either. Better gastric tolerance to metformin was recorded in the psyllium group. FBS, and HbA1c, showed a significant reduction (p<0.05), whereas HDL-C increased significantly (p<0.05) following psyllium treatment. LDL/HDL ratio was significantly decreased (p<0.05). Our results show that 5.1g b.i.d. of psyllium for persons with type II diabetes is safe, well tolerated, and improves glycemic control."

            "abstract": "Microalbuminuria has recently been associated with insulin resistance in both insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent (NIDDM) diabetes mellitus. To establish whether microalbuminuria in non-diabetic subjects as well is associated with insulin resistance and associated abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism, oral glucose tolerance tests were performed with measurement of urinary albumin excretion rate, lipids and lipoproteins in 582 male non-diabetic first-degree relatives of patients with NIDDM. In addition, insulin sensitivity was assessed in 20 of these subjects with the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique. Abnormal albumin excretion rate (AER), defined as AER 15-200 micrograms/min, was associated with higher systolic blood pressure (p < 0.05), higher fasting glucose values (p < 0.05), lower HDL-cholesterol (p < 0.05) and lower apolipoprotein A-I (p < 0.05) concentrations than observed in subjects with normal AER. The rate of glucose metabolism was lower in subjects with abnormal compared to subjects with normal albumin excretion rate (38.0 +/- 2.8 vs 47.3 +/- 2.4 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1; p = 0.028). This difference was almost completely accounted for by a reduction in non-oxidative glucose metabolism (17.7 +/- 1.9 vs 27.4 +/- 2.7 mumol.kg lean body mass-1.min-1; p = 0.010), which correlated inversely with the AER (r = -0.543; p = 0.013). These results suggest that in non-diabetic individuals genetically predisposed to NIDDM, abnormal AER is associated with insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism."

At the baseline, diabetic patients were asked of existing coronary heart disease (CHD) and hypertension, and checked for body mass index (BMI), glycemic control, lipid values and overnight albuminuria. Of 381 identified NIDDM patients, 252 (66%) participated in the study. The median age was 58 (range 36-64) years, BMI 30.5 (S.D. 5.5) kg/m2 and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 8.7 (S.D. 2.0)%. Overall 5-year mortality was 8.3%. Factors associated with mortality were male gender, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, initial CHD and albuminuria > or = 20 microg/min. In Cox regression analysis, combination of CHD and albuminuria had the highest relative risk for mortality (RR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.63-7.19, P = 0.001), adjusted for gender and age. Albuminuria was associated with CHD only in male NIDDM patients.

Patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) have an increased cardiovascular risk. However, oestrogen replacement therapy is only reluctantly prescribed for patients with NIDDM. In a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial we assessed the effect of oral 17 beta-estradiol during 6 weeks in 40 postmenopausal women with NIDDM. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin sensitivity, suppressibility of hepatic glucose production, lipoprotein profile and parameters of fibrinolysis were determined. The oestrogen treated group demonstrated a significant decrease of HbA1c and in the normotriglyceridaemic group a significantly increased suppression of hepatic glucose production by insulin. Whole body glucose uptake and concentrations of non-esterified fatty acids did not change. LDL-cholesterol- and apolipoprotein B levels decreased, and HDL-cholesterol, its subfraction HDL2-cholesterol and apolipotrotein A1 increased. The plasma triglyceride level remained similar in both groups. Both the concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen and its active subfraction decreased. Tissue type plasminogen activator activity increased significantly only in the normotriglyceridaemic group. Oestrogen replacement therapy improves insulin sensitivity in liver, glycaemic control, lipoprotein profile and fibrinolysis in postmenopausal women with NIDDM. For a definite answer as to whether oestrogens can be more liberally used in NIDDM patients, long term studies including the effect of progestogens are necessary."

Levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol increased across the gradient never/ex/current smoker, with a reverse gradient for HDL-cholesterol. Never-smokers were slightly lighter than other groups and males were younger, differences insufficient to explain the lipid variation. Minor differences in blood pressure between groups did not show this gradient and the development of new hypertension was not consistently related to smoking habits. In contrast the expression of newly-recorded cardiovascular disease was greater and in some categories doubled for current or ex-smokers in contrast with never-smokers. This survey emphasises first, the continuing inadequacy of stop-smoking support even at specialist clinics, second, that patients who give up smoking are to be congratulated and benefit in the long-term but third, that the change in status can be recent and classification as ex-smoker can conceal high short-term risk, for which lipid profiles may also be significant and justify priority attention in management."

All subjects underwent coronary arteriography, and patients were divided into 3 groups based upon the results of the coronary arteriograms: 1) patients with a negative angiogram (CAD-, n = 30), without hypertension; 2) patients with a positive angiogram, without hypertension (CAD+, n = 70); and 3) patients with a positive angiogram, who had hypertension (CAD + HT, n = 25). Mean fasting plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations of these 3 groups of patients were compared to values in age and weight-matched groups of normal individuals (n = 80) and untreated patients with hypertension and no evidence of CAD (HT, n = 20). The results indicated that total plasma triglyceride, cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) than normal in patients with CAD+ and CAD + HT, whereas only plasma cholesterol levels were higher than normal in patients with HT. Although patients with CAD- had values intermediate between normal and CAD, the differences were not statistically significant. In addition, the ratio of LDL to HDL-cholesterol was significantly increased (P less than 0.05-0.001) above normal in patients with CAD+, CAD + HT, and HT. As before, the values in patients with CAD- were intermediate. These data document the presence of multiple abnormalities of lipid and lipoprotein concentration in patients with angiographic evidence of CAD, whether or not they were hypertensive. Furthermore, abnormalities in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism were seen in patients with hypertension alone."

            "abstract": "Both pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are effective hypoglycaemic agents in monotherapy as in combined therapy. Interestingly, their reducing effect on fasting glycaemia and HbA1c is maintained over time, suggesting a potential protective effect of glitazones on the pancreatic beta-cells. The effects on lipids of pioglitazone are more favourable than those of rosiglitazone. Indeed, pioglitazone appears to be well suited for diabetic dyslipidaemia, increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, decreasing triglycerides and small, dense low-density (LDL) particles with usually no effect on plasma LDL-cholesterol. Rosiglitazone also increases HDL-cholesterol, but has no effect on triglycerides and increases plasma LDL-cholesterol."

Subjects were followed for a mean of 9.8 (range: 1.8-16.4) years, during which 261 (76 men and 185 women) developed NIDDM. In men and women, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, VLDL triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein triglyceride and total triglyceride, controlled for age, predicted NIDDM (P < 0.01 for each). These effects diminished when controlled for age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure and 2-h glucose. However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, controlled for age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure and 2-h glucose, was a significant protective factor for NIDDM in women (hazard rate ratio (HRR) = 0.35, 95% CI (0.23-0.54), P < 0.001, 90th compared with 10th percentile) but not in men (HRR = 1.04, 95% CI (0.53-2.05), P = 0.915). This association remained significant in women when controlled for fasting or 2-h plasma insulin concentrations, other estimates of insulin resistance or alcohol consumption. The protective effect of HDL cholesterol was similar among women with normal (2-h glucose < 7.8 mmol/1) or impaired (7.8 mmol/l < or = 2-h glucose < 11.1 mmol/l) glucose tolerance at baseline. These results indicate that lipoprotein disorders are an early accompaniment of the abnormalities that lead to NIDDM."

            "abstract": "Disorders in lipoprotein metabolism (dyslipidemia) can result in premature atherosclerosis or pancreatitis. Dyslipidemias can be classified as hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, combined hyperlipidemia, and low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. All of the dyslipidemias can be primary or secondary. Both elevated levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol predispose to premature atherosclerosis. Triglyceride levels greater than 1,000 mg/dL increase the risk for pancreatitis. In the appraisal of the dyslipidemias, measurement of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and obtaining the LDL cholesterol by Friedewald equation is usually sufficient in the majority of patients. However, in some cases, such as the diagnosis of the Type III dyslipidemia and when triglycerides are > or = 400 mg/dL, ultracentrifugation is required to determine the VLDL or LDL cholesterol. Lipoprotein electrophoresis can be useful in the diagnosis of Type III dyslipidemia (broad beta band) and also to detect chylomicrons. In young subjects with coronary artery disease with a normal LDL cholesterol an apolipoprotein B-100 level may be a useful test. In children and young adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, measurement of lipoprotein lipase activity or assaying apolipoprotein C-II levels can be useful in elucidating the cause. Also, laboratory tests are useful in excluding a secondary cause of dyslipidemia (urinalysis, plasma creatinine, TSH, glucose, protein electrophoresis, alkaline phosphatase and transaminases). Thus, laboratory investigations play an important role in the management of dyslipidemia."

In view of such a background, changes in cholesterol and other lipid parameters in the Japanese population associated with excess body weight and hypertension were analyzed in this study based on data obtained in an epidemiological survey carried out in 1990. Hypertension was closely associated with a higher body mass index (BMI). Among the lipid parameters, triglyceride (TG) and non-HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-cholesterol) levels showed remarkable differences between hypertensive and normotensive subjects, with a greater statistical significance than LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Changes in lipid parameters in the presence of hypertension were mostly associated with an increase in BMI in younger men aged 20-39, while increases in TG levels took place independently of excess body weight in middle-aged (40-59-year old) men. Considering that hypertension is a common and the greatest risk factor in the Japanese population, TG and non-HDL-C appear to be more important than LDL-C as major lipid parameters related to atherogenesis."

Lipoproteins were measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

NMR lipoproteins added discriminative value to HDL-cholesterol and TG levels (net reclassification improvement of 40.0%; p < 0.001; and integrated discrimination improvement of 9.5%; p < 0.001), with net benefit within predicted probabilities of between 10% and 50% by Vickers' decision-curve analysis. We also demonstrated additive value to demographic variables, BMI and levels of fasting glucose, TG, and HDL-cholesterol (net reclassification improvement of 14.0%; p < 0.001; and integrated discrimination improvement of 4.5%; p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions/interpretation:\n        \n      \n      NMR lipoproteins, which can be measured in the fasting state, add information to the TG and HDL-cholesterol ratio across a broad range on insulin resistance.

Most of these studies used insulin twice daily, however, and hence failed to offer a significant practical advantage over insulin therapy alone. Since a subcutaneous injection of Ultralente insulin exerts its peak effect between 16 and 18 hours after injection, its prebreakfast administration is likely to inhibit overnight hepatic glucose production, which is a primary modulator of fasting plasma glucose, a major determinant of diurnal glycemia in NIDDM: Moreover, the simultaneous administration of regular insulin tends to improve glycemia during the premeal and immediate postmeal period before the onset of sulfonylurea-induced insulin secretion.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We assessed the efficacy of a prebreakfast subcutaneous injection of mixed Ultralente and regular insulin in conjunction with prior sulfonylurea therapy in 20 NIDDM subjects after precise documentation of secondary failure to these agents initially for the period of 3 months, followed by a long-term evaluation for up to 2 years.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Metabolic control improved significantly as reflected by a decline in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c concentrations (FPG, 14.4 mmol/L +/- 0.4 vs 79 mmol/L +/- 0.3 mM/L; HbA1c, 11.7% +/- 0.3% vs 8.8% +/- 0.1%; P less than .001 for both comparisons).

ROOHs were measured by the ferrous oxidation with xylenol orange assay coupled with the selective ROOH reductant triphenylphosphine. Formation of the ferric xylenol orange complex was determined at 560 nm and calibrated against H2O2. For 22 individuals with NIDDM, a concentration of 9.04 +/- 4.3 mumol/l (mean +/- SD) ROOH was recorded. This concentration was higher (P < 0.0005 by separate-variance t test) than that of plasma ROOHs from control subjects (3.76 +/- 2.48 mumol/l). There was no difference between concentrations of plasma malondialdehyde measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive material (TBARM) in NIDDM or control subjects (1.00 +/- 0.70 vs. 1.21 +/- 0.62 mumol/l, respectively; P > 0.1). A trend to lower vitamin E levels in the NIDDM group (9.03 +/- 3.31 vs. 10.31 +/- 5.02 micrograms/ml in control subjects) failed to achieve significance at the 95% confidence level. Plasma ROOHs in the diabetic group did not correlate with total plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, fasting glucose, HbA1, vitamin E, or TBARM levels. These data indicate that measurement of authentic ROOHs shows NIDDM to be associated with oxidative stress, which may be unrelated to abnormalities in lipid metabolism and glycemic control."

Although associations between hyperglycaemia and diabetic complications have been repeatedly shown for microvascular disease, such an association is weaker for macrovascular disease. We report on the results of estimations of different serum lipids in 78 children with diabetes mellitus. These results are compared with those of assessment of the quality of glycaemic control. The results show an association between the quality of glycaemic control and the height of triglycerid concentrations. There were no associations between the quality of glycaemic control and LDL- and HDL-cholesterol. Cholesterol showed only a weak association to glycaemic control.

The decrease in HDL-cholesterol with increasing VLDL-triglycerides was relatively much larger than the concomitant decrease in apo A-I. The relative decrease in the sum of cholesterol and triglycerides in the HDL fraction was similar to that for apo A-I, suggesting that the decreasing HDL-cholesterol:apo A-I ratio with increasing VLDL-triglycerides is due in large part to reciprocal transfer of cholesteryl esters for triglycerides between HDL and VLDL. Mean apo A-I level was 16 mg/dl higher in women not taking exogenous sex steroids than in men, 31 mg/dl higher in women taking estrogens without progestins and 10 mg/dl higher in contraceptive drug users than in other women, and 8 mg/dl higher in black than in white men.

HDL-cholesterol was not significantly different in either group.

In contrast to control subjects, VLDL-cholesterol was positively correlated to the tolbutamide-induced insulin reserve (before insulin administration) and to the diurnal insulin dosage (after insulin administration) (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.001). The results show that the atherosclerotic risk in diabetics with persisting hyperlipidemia is higher than in control subjects and that the risk is distinguished by increased VLDL-cholesterol in correlation with increased insulin concentrations. Since the atherosclerotic risk is even more accentuated by the fact that insulin administration increases LDL-cholesterol, insulin therapy must be observed carefully in these patients."

Five of the nondiabetic twins had normal and seven had impaired glucose tolerance. 13 matched, healthy subjects without a family history of diabetes were included as control subjects. The NIDDM twins were more obese compared with their non-diabetic co-twins.

Furthermore, the nondiabetic twins had a decreased first-phase insulin response and a decreased maximal insulin secretion capacity during hyperglycemic clamping and intravenous glucagon administration. Nondiabetic twins and controls had similar rates of HGP. Compared with both nondiabetic twins and controls, the NIDDM twins had an elevated basal rate of HGP, a further decreased insulin sensitivity, and a further impaired insulin secretion pattern as determined by all tests.

            "abstract": "Aim:\n        \n      \n      Cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) reflects arterial stiffness and has been established as a useful surrogate marker of atherosclerosis. Contrary to the abundant data indicating slower progression of atherosclerosis with statins, studies on fibrates remain scarce. The aim of this study was thus to clarify the effect of bezafibrate on CAVI as well as on oxidative stress.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A randomized, open-label, controlled study was performed. 66 hypertriglyceridemic patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned to two groups: bezafibrate (400 mg/day) group and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 1.8 g/day) group. Patients were administered the respective treatment for 12 weeks. CAVI, glycolipid metabolic parameters, and diacron-reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROMs) were evaluated before and after the study period.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Serum triglycerides (TG), remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C), fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c and d-ROMs decreased, while HDL-cholesterol increased significantly in the bezafibrate group but did not change in the EPA group. The decreases in TG, RLP-C, HbA1c and d-ROMs were significantly greater in the bezafibrate group than in the EPA group. CAVI decreased significantly only in the bezafibrate group and the decrease was significantly greater in bezafibrate group than in EPA group. Simple regression analysis showed no significant relationship between the change in CAVI and changes in other variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified high baseline CAVI, low HDL-cholesterol level, and bezafibrate administration as significant independent predictors of CAVI decrease.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Bezafibrate treatment ameliorates arterial stiffness accompanied by improvement of glycolipid metabolism and oxidative stress. These effects potentially have important beneficial health consequences in hypertriglyceridemic patients with type 2 diabetes."

            "abstract": "We previously observed beneficial effects of a carbohydrate-reduced, high-protein (CRHP) diet on cardiovascular risk markers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a crossover 2 × 6-week trial, when all food was provided to subjects as ready-to-eat meals. Here, we report the results from a 6-month open label extension: 28 patients with T2DM were instructed to self-prepare the CRHP diet with dietetic guidance. At weeks 0, 6, 12, and 36, fasting and postprandial (4-h meal test) blood samples were collected for measurements of total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triacylglycerol (TG), apolipoproteins A1 and B, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-6. Diurnal blood pressure and heart rate were also assessed. At the end of the study (week 36), concentrations of fasting total and LDL-cholesterol, fasting and postprandial NEFA and TG, and fasting apolipoprotein-B, CRP and TNF-α concentrations were significantly lower compared with week 0 (p < 0.05). A significant decrease in diurnal heart rate was also observed. From week 12 to 36, an increase in HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein-A1 concentrations and a further reduction in fasting and postprandial NEFA (p < 0.05) were found. These changes were independent of minor fluctuations in body weight. We conclude that the substitution of dietary carbohydrate for protein and fat has beneficial effects on several cardiovascular risk markers in patients with T2DM, which are maintained or augmented over the next 6 months when patients select and prepare the CRHP diet on their own in a dietitian-supported setting."

These associations remained significant after adjustment for each other. Age, alcohol intake and social class were not independently associated with heart rate. There was a significant positive association between heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressures, levels of blood cholesterol, triglycerides and blood glucose and a significant inverse association between heart rate and HDL-cholesterol levels, even after adjusting for the above confounding factors. After further adjustment for each of the other physiological variables, heart rate remained independently associated with diastolic and systolic blood pressures and levels of triglycerides and blood glucose. The relationship between heart rate and levels of total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol appeared to be secondary to its association with triglyceride levels. The association between body-mass index and heart rate diminished after further adjustments for systolic blood pressure, suggesting that the primary effect of body weight is on blood pressure rather than on heart rate.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our findings indicate that elevated heart rate is associated with hypertension and with an atherogenic lipoprotein profile and support the suggestion that disturbance of the autonomic nervous system may underlie these associations."

Increased apoA-IV levels have been reported in plasma from NIDDM patients. The aim of the present study was to look for a possible association between plasma apoA-IV level and prevalence of macrovascular disease in NIDDM. One hundred and thirty-six NIDDM patients were studied (71 men, 65 women). Macrovascular disease was assessed in each patient by a standardized questionnaire, physical examination, resting electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory evaluation (ankle/arm blood pressure ratio, continuous wave Doppler velocimetry). Moreover, patients without any history of coronary heart disease and showing a normal resting ECG underwent a bicycle exercise test or a dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy to detect possible silent myocardial ischemia. Among the 136 NIDDM patients, 56 had macrovascular disease. ApoA-IV levels were significantly higher in NIDDM patients with macrovascular disease than in NIDDM patients without macrovascular disease (20.9 +/- 8.6 vs. 13.3 +/- 5.3 mg/dl; P < 0.001). The influence of different factors, such as age, BMI, cigarette smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, apoA-IV level, apoA-IV phenotype, fasting glycemia, fasting C-peptide, and microalbuminuria, on the prevalence of macrovascular disease was analyzed using a logistic regression model. In the univariate analysis, apoA-IV level (P < 0.00001), age (P = 0.0087), hypertension (P = 0.012), microalbuminuria (P = 0.018), triglycerides (P = 0.02), and fasting C-peptide (P = 0.03) were positively associated with macrovascular disease. In the multivariate analysis, macrovascular disease was positively associated only with apoA-IV (P < 0.0001) and age (P = 0.003) and negatively associated with HDL cholesterol (P = 0.013). These results indicate that increased plasma apoA-IV level is associated with an increased prevalence of macrovascular disease in NIDDM.

When a higher dose of insulin was given and in a comparable condition of glycaemia these changes continued to increase up to the 6th week of treatment, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol decreased. Sulfonylurea secondary failures in the menopause which were euglycaemic after a 6-week insulin therapy (n = 20) revealed at this date a higher HDL-cholesterol, lower triglycerides and a more favourable quotient total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol as well as a shorter duration of diabetes than the female patients with more unfavourable condition of glycaemia (n = 20). Already before the induction of the insulin therapy the later on euglycaemic female patients showed an on an average lower triglyceride level than the comparative group. The reductions of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides after insulinization did not significantly differ between the two groups. On the other hand, the decrease of the quotient total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol was significantly more distinctly characterized in the female diabetics who had become euglycaemic after a 6-week insulin therapy on account of an increase of HDL-cholesterol which is to be registered only in these patients. In sulfonylurea secondary failures in the menopause without essential overweight insulinization leads to an improvement of the lipoprotein profile, particularly when a euglycaemic metabolic conduction is achieved."

Analysis of HbA1c covariance, indicator of chronic hyperglycemia, is a factor which primarily determines sjTREC differences between the groups, regardless of other factors. DM2 modifies sjTREC number in the peripheral blood. The level of sjTREC concentration is affected by DM2 duration, the degree of glycemic control.

It was confirmed that with the exception of the nonselective beta-blocker sotalol, beta-blocker therapy has little influence on the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. The small differences in mean changes in LDL-cholesterol observed among the three groups of beta-blockers are probably of negligible practical importance. More important differences emerged from the pooling of data on plasma triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Here, beta-blockers possessing ISA showed the smallest mean increase in triglycerides and an increase in HDL-cholesterol, which compared favorably with the decrease found for nonselective and beta 1-selective beta-blockers. Of the individual beta-blockers, pindolol exhibited the most favorable lipid profile. A close inverse correlation was found between the changes in triglycerides and HDL-cholesterol in the various studies. This finding, together with other arguments, supports the view that these changes are the result of inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by adrenergic mechanisms."

Cross-sectional analyses were undertaken on data from 540 participants, aged 60 to 98 years, free of dementia and stroke. TC, HDL, LDL, and triglyceride levels were obtained. Cognitive function was assessed using a thorough neuropsychological test battery, including domains of cognitive function indexed by multiple cognitive tests.

Significant positive associations were observed between HDL-cholesterol and the Global Composite score, Working Memory, and the MMSE after adjustment for demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. Participants with desirable levels of HDL (≥60 mg/dL) had the highest scores on all cognitive outcomes. There were no significant associations observed between TC, LDL, or triglyceride concentrations and cognition. In older individuals, HDL-cholesterol was related to a composite of Working Memory tests and for general measures of cognitive ability when adjusted for cardiovascular variables.

Patients and controls were recruited from the population of Rome, considered representative of Central and Southern Italy. There were no significant differences in allele frequencies between the two groups, though APOB X-, R- and I, APOE*3, and ACE D alleles were slightly more frequent in the cases than in the controls. The patients did not differ from the controls for plasma total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apoAI values, while they presented significantly higher levels of triglycerides and apoB, and lower apoE levels. TC, apoE, and apoB quantitative values, adjusted for age, varied significantly among APOB XbaI and APOE genotypes. APOB X-X- genotype was associated in patients with a significantly lower mean TC concentration than the other two genotypes pooled together.

In the patients, 3-2 genotype had significantly lower apoB levels than the pooled 3-3 and 4-3 class. We conclude that in the Italian women the DNA polymorphisms studied in this work do not seem to be important risk factors for CAD occurrence; that apoE quantitation could be another useful parameter to identify subjects at risk of CAD; and that APOB X- and APOE*2 are the alleles that most influence the interindividual plasma lipid variation among CAD female patients."

            "abstract": "In the present study the effect of oral physiological magnesium supplementation on atherogenic risk factors such as serum lipids and blood pressure was examined. Sixty-nine patients with hyperlipidaemia of Frederickson types IV and IIb were investigated with regard to renal function, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, and plasma and erythrocytic magnesium concentrations. All patients were on cholesterol-poor (< 90 mg cholesterol/d) and energy-restricted diet (< 1200 kcal/d). Thirty-seven patients received 500 mg magnesium (oral) daily as a supplement. All measurements were performed before and four weeks after starting treatment. The results of our study show that oral physiological magnesium supplementation in addition to the usual dietary measures can be beneficial with regard to serum triglycerides (values, means +/- SD, decreased from 198.17 +/- 47.01 to 163.20 +/- 40.55 mg/dl, P < 0.05), but exerts no positive effect on blood pressure or serum cholesterol. Furthermore, erythrocyte magnesium concentration increased significantly during oral physiological magnesium supplementation (values, means +/- SD, increased from 1.72 +/- 0.22 to 1.91 +/- 0.18 mmol/litre, P < 0.05), whereas plasma magnesium concentrations did not change significantly."

In the middle-aged group, hypertension and HDL-cholesterol levels and, in the elderly group, only HDL-cholesterol levels were independently associated with CHD. No significant difference was found between a group of healthy centenarians and elderly and middle-aged subjects without CHD.

Small LDL size is also associated with a high-risk profile, including increased levels of triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Furthermore, some human HDL particles contain both apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and apoA-II (LpA-I:A-II) while others contain apoA-I but are devoid of apoA-II (LpA-I). We have investigated the relationship between LDL size, measured by non-denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis, and HDL parameters, particularly LpA-I and LpA-I:A-II levels, in healthy control subjects (n = 408). LDL size was positively and significantly correlated with HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.43), apoA-I (r = 0.32) and LpA-I (r = 0.29), whereas no correlation was observed with apoA-II and LpA-I:A-II. The determination of the mean apoA-I and LpA-I in the quintiles of LDL size distribution revealed a progressive increase in apoA-I and LpoA-I from the first quintile (small LDLs), 137 and 42 mg dL-1 respectively, to the fifth quintile (large LDLs), 161 and 54 mg dL-1 respectively. Conversely, no evolution of apoA-II and LpA-I:A-II was observed. Multivariate analysis showed that not only triglycerides, but also HDL-cholesterol, apoA-I and LpA-I, are determinants of LDL size, depending on the model used. Thus, part of the variation in size of LDLs is associated with the metabolism of HDL independently of that of triglycerides. Thus, a low concentration of LpA-I combined with the presence of small LDLs could contribute to the high-risk profile observed in subjects with small LDLs."

The examined group comprised 42 patients suffering from primary hypertension. All examined patients underwent laboratory tests as follows: concentration of homocysteine, folic acid, TC, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, TG, apoAI and apoB. All patients were orally administered with 15 mg of folic acid per day for 45 d. After this period, all laboratory tests were repeated. Homocysteine concentration was measured by the FPIA method, concentrations of apoAI and apoB were measured by the nephelometric method, and other parameters with routine methods. After administration of 15 mg of folic acid to patients with primary hypertension, a considerable decrease in the concentration of homocysteine was observed in parallel with a substantive growth of HDL-cholesterol, as well as apoprotein AI concentrations and a reduction of the apoprotein B concentration. Results of statistical analysis indicated a significant correlation between the decline in homocysteine concentration and the increase in HDL-cholesterol concentration, as well as between the increase of folic acid concentration and the increase in apoAI concentration in patients following the intake of folic acid. The drop in homocysteine concentration through the supplementation with folic acid can cause quantitative changes in the lipid and lipoprotein parameters which, in consequence, may lead to the mitigation of risk concerning the development of atherosclerosis."

Among the lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein ratios in the patients, only the ratios HDL-C:LDL-C, apolipoprotein A1:apolipoprotein B, and HDL-C: apolipoprotein B increased significantly as a result of the opposing responses of the protective lipoprotein HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 and the atherogenic lipoprotein LDL-C and apolipoprotein B.

Altogether, 158 NIDDM patients (97 men [16.7%] and 61 women [12.8%]) died of CHD and 256 NIDDM patients (156 men [26.8%] and 100 women [20.9%]) had a serious CHD event (death from CHD or nonfatal myocardial infarction). A previous history of myocardial infarction, low HDL cholesterol level (<1.0 mmol/l), high non-HDL cholesterol (> or =5.2 mmol/l), high total triglyceride level (>2.3 mmol/l), and high fasting plasma glucose (>13.4 mmol/l) were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of CHD mortality or morbidity, independently of other cardiovascular risk factors. High calculated LDL cholesterol level (> or =4.1 mmol/l) was significantly associated with all CHD events. The simultaneous presence of high fasting glucose (>13.4 mmol/l) with low HDL cholesterol, low HDL-to-total cholesterol ratio, or high total triglycerides further increased the risk for CHD events up to threefold. Our 7-year follow-up study provides evidence that dyslipidemia and poor glycemic control predict CHD mortality and morbidity in patients with NIDDM."

In January 1993, 8% of patients with normoalbuminuria, 20% of patients with microalbuminuria, and 35% of patients with macroalbuminuria had died (predominantly from cardiovascular disease) (P < 0.01 [normoalbuminuria versus micro- and macroalbuminuria] and P < 0.05 [microalbuminuria versus macroalbuminuria]). Cox multiple regression analysis revealed significant predictors of all-cause mortality to be preexisting coronary heart disease (relative risk [95% confidence interval]), 2.9 (1.6-5.1); log10AER (factor 10), 1.9 (1.4-2.6); HbA1c level (%), 1.2 (1.0-1.4); and age (years), 1.08 (1.03-1.13). Significant predictors of cardiovascular mortality included preexisting coronary heart disease, 6.1 (2.8-13.5); macroalbuminuria, 2.5 (1.1-5.8); HbA1c level (%), 1.3 (1.1-1.6); and systolic blood pressure (10 mmHg), 1.2 (1.0-1.4). Univariate Cox survival analysis in the normoalbuminuric group revealed that AER above the median of 8 mg/24 h was associated with an increased all-cause mortality risk of 2.7 (0.93-7.69) (P = 0.07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is associated with the increased risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications. The aim of this study was to determine risk factors for the development of long-term complications of Type 2 diabetes. We analyzed medical records of all patients, who came with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes to one regional outpatient diabetes clinic from 1980 to 1994 (n=2175). The data, such as fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, blood pressure and body mass index (BMI), were assessed. Also, the time from the diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes to the occurrence of complications was obtained. Using the regression model in the survival analysis, we examined which of the risk factors determined the rate of the development of nephropathy, proliferative retinopathy, cardiovascular disease and stroke. Patients with higher fasting plasma glucose and higher mean blood pressure had higher risk of developing nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy. Higher mean arterial blood pressure was associated with higher rate of stroke and cardiovascular disease. High total cholesterol increased the hazard of coronary artery disease and proliferative retinopathy. In conclusion, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose are major risk factors for microvascular complications in Type 2 diabetes. An increased blood pressure determined the macrovascular complications in Type 2 diabetes, but the effect of increased fasting plasma glucose could not be proved."

            "abstract": "Hyperglycaemia, a raised fibrinogen, an increased serum triglyceride and a reduced HDL-cholesterol are common metabolic features of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Hypertension is frequently associated with NIDDM, however the influence of antihypertensive therapy on these combined factors in the diabetic is at present unclear. In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study in 20 stable NIDDM subjects with hypertension, the metabolic effects of 6 weeks' treatment with the alpha-blocker, doxazosin, was compared with treatment with the beta-blocker, atenolol. Similar and significant reductions in BP were produced by both drugs. Significant increases in weight, HbA1, apoprotein B, serum triglyceride and cholesterol/HDL ratio were observed with atenolol therapy. Doxazosin therapy was associated with opposite patterns of changes in fasting glucose, lipids and lipoproteins but only for serum triglyceride was difference between treatments significant. Fibrinogen was not altered by either treatment. Conclusions from this study indicate; 1) adrenergic mechanisms may be an important influence on glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism in NIDDM and 2) the beta-blocker, atenolol, has a small adverse effect on weight, glycaemic control and the atherogenic lipid profile, whereas the alpha-blocker, doxazosin, has no such effect and may, in part, correct the disturbances of lipoprotein metabolism characteristic of NIDDM."

Insulin may exert a direct growth promoting effect on cardiomyocytes rather than affecting the LV internal diameter. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of IR on LV geometry. We enrolled 105 patients (71 females, mean age, 49.2 +/- 13.6 years) with recently diagnosed and untreated hypertension (blood pressure > 140 and/or 90 mmHg, fasting glucose < 110 mg/dL), and grouped them as normal (N) (39 patients, 26 females, mean age, 48.5 +/- 14.7 years) if all M-mode echocardiographic measurements were within normal limits, concentric remodeling (CR) (22 patients, 15 females, mean age, 50.5 +/- 14.8 years) if relative wall thickness was increased but left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was normal, concentric hypertrophy (CH) (13 patients, 9 females, mean age, 50.3 +/- 10.8 years) if both ventricular thicknesses and the LVMI were increased, and eccentric hypertrophy (EH) (31 patients, 21 females, mean age, 48.6 +/- 12.9 years) if ventricular thicknesses were normal, but LVMI was increased. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all subjects, and interventricular septal thickness (IVS), posterior wall thickness (PWT), sum of wall thickness (SWT), left ventricular end-diastolic internal diameter (LVED), relative wall thickness (RWT), and LVMI were recorded. Blood samples for routine biochemical examination and fasting insulin levels were obtained and then the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index was calculated by the formula: HOMA Index = Fasting Blood Glucose (mg/dL) x Immunoreactive Insulin (microU/mL)/405, for the assessment of IR. There were no significant differences among the groups with respect to age, blood pressure (BP) levels, fasting blood glucose (FBG), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), or triglyceride (TG) levels. Insulin levels were significantly higher in the CR and CH groups in comparison with the N group (P = 0.004), and the HOMA index was higher in the CH group compared to the N group (P = 0.024). In Pearson's correlation analysis, insulin was found to be directly correlated with IVS (r = 0.29, P = 0.002), SWT (r = 0.25, P = 0.009), and RWT (r = 0.33, P = 0.0001). The HOMA index was also directly correlated with IVS (r = 0.33, P = 0.001), SWT (r = 0.29, P = 0.002), and RWT (r = 0.29, P = 0.003). Cardiac changes in hypertensive patients include increased LVMI and altered LV geometry. The concentric LV geometry seen in hypertensive patients might be mediated, at least in part, by increased insulin levels and the HOMA index."

            "abstract": "Breast cancer patients are known to be at increased risk for developing other chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease. Studies by different investigators have shown a correlation between increased dietary fat or hypercholesterolemia and the occurrence of breast cancer. Since previous studies on lipoprotein subfractions in this type of cancer have been inconsistent, we evaluated the lipids and lipoprotein subfraction levels in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer in an attempt to identify the risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. The study included 132 patients, 56 of which were suffering from breast cancer, 32 from pancreatic and 44 age-matched controls. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides and lipoprotein fractions as well as TC/High density lipoprotein (HDL) and HDL2/HDL3 ratios were estimated by standard laboratory techniques. An increase in triglycerides and a decrease in HDL-cholesterol, especially in the HDL2 subfraction, were observed in patients with breast cancer as compared to the controls (P < 0.05). The maximum changes in TC, and HDL concentrations were observed in patients with advanced disease. Analysis of indexes of atherosclerosis (TC/HDL, and HDL2/HDL3 ratios) demonstrated that breast cancer patients had significantly higher TC/HDL ratio (6.44+/-1.24) compared with controls (3.43+/-0.57, p = 0.001), and patients with pancreatic cancer (3.79+/-0.15, p = 0.027). The results have demonstrated an unfavourable lipid profile in untreated breast cancer patients with high atherosclerosis indexes. This observation is of great importance, considering the potential use of endocrine therapy that could result in further deterioration of lipid indexes. We propose the evaluation and monitoring of lipid profile prior and after the induction of hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients, as a routine in clinical setting."

At baseline, ethanol consumption was found to be positively associated with triglycerides, HDL-C, and Apo-A1 and negatively associated with LDL-C/LDL-B. After adjustment for several covariables, alcohol consumption was found to be positively associated with the increases in triglycerides and in Apo-A1 observed at 3 and 6 months after initiation of OCs.

In women, taking estroprogestatives, cholesterol, triglycerides, apoproteins AI and B were higher than in controls; HDL-cholesterol was not modified. Lipoprotein analyses in polyacrylamide gradient gel exhibited an increase of the HDL3 fraction at the expense of the HDL2 fraction, with a reduced LDL size. Smoking in addition to estroprogestative absorption accentuated these modifications and led to a decreased HDL-cholesterol (HDL2 fraction essentially), with an increased LDL-cholesterol. In men, smoking resulted in higher levels of total cholesterol, apoprotein B and LDL-cholesterol, without any significant change in LDL size, higher levels of triglycerides and lower level of the HDL2 fraction without any change in HDL-cholesterol. In women, smoking led only to an increase in triglycerides. In summary, analysis of the distribution of HDL subclasses and of LDL size showed an evolution towards a supposed more atherogenic lipid profile in women taking oral contraceptives associated or not with smoking, and in male smokers."

Ever since we became aware of the abnormally high incidence of coronary artery disease amongst Indians, there always has been an ever-growing need for study of lipid values amongst Indian children and adolescents. Five hundred and eighty-six children (352 boys and 234 girls) from a public school aged between 8 and 18 years (mean age: 12.86 for boys and 12.15 for girls) were included in the study for assessment of lipid profile during the period from April, 1999 to March, 2000. Fasting venous blood was drawn from each child and total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured by enzymatic method, high-density lipoportein (HDL)-cholesterol was measured using specific precipitation method and lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] was measured by immunoturbidimetric method. After biochemical estimation was completed reference values and percentiles were calculated for each lipid component. Mean cholesterol and triglyceride values were higher amongst girls compared to boys. HDL-cholesterol values were lower amongst Indian boys compared to girls. Mean Lp (a) values were higher amongst both Indian boys and girls and more so amongst girls compared to boys. Since Lp(a) values remain unchanged through ages, these values should represent corresponding values in adult Indian males and females.

            "abstract": "Insulin resistance with consecutive hyperinsulinemia is associated with dyslipidemia in individuals with metabolic syndrome or \"syndrome x\". This dyslipidemia is characterized by a hypertriglyceridemia and reduced levels of HDL-(high density lipoprotein)cholesterol in plasma. Table 1 summarizes the alterations of lipoproteins in insulin resistance. In severe forms of insulin resistance LDL-(low density lipoprotein)cholesterol can be elevated as well. The hypertriglyceridemia is caused by an elevated synthesis and secretion of VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) in the liver and by reduced metabolism, mediated e.g. by lipoprotein lipase. The alterations of VLDL-metabolism are associated with a reduced concentration of HDL-cholesterol. In addition the composition of lipoprotein particles can be altered, which might interfere with their normal metabolism. Furthermore addition direct effects of insulin on cellular cholesterol metabolism have been described. These alterations in lipid metabolism which are due to an insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia might be related to the increased coronary risk which has been observed in patients with metabolic syndrome. Therefore the diagnostic approach in patients with hypertriglyceridemia should consider the possibility of an underlying glucose intolerance or Type 2 diabetes. Therapeutic aims and strategies are discussed. In accordance to guidelines of the American Heart Association the goals of lipid-lowering therapy take into account the prevalence of various cardiovascular risk factors in an individual patient (Table 2). Principle actions of lipid-lowering drugs on plasma lipids are outlined in Table 3. Table 4 summarizes the effect of antihypertensive drugs on plasma lipids and lipoproteins, which should be considered in the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia."

This has been considered to be due to the rise in the high-density cholesterol lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol). Since the response of the HDL-subfractions to moderate or heavy dose of alcohol is less clear, we now compared the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol status between groups consuming different amounts of alcohol. In this population-based survey serum total high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and its HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions were blindly compared between 264 consecutive middle-aged men (37 teetotallers, 137 moderate drinkers, 90 heavy drinkers) participating in a voluntary health screening and 104 male alcoholics. Alcohol consumption correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with total HDL-cholesterol, HDL2, HDL3 when all subjects (n = 368) were included but the correlation disappeared when alcoholics were excluded (n = 264). In comparison with teetotallers, alcoholics had significantly higher total HDL-cholesterol, HDL2 and HDL3 values (P < 0.001). Moderate or heavy intake of alcohol had no effect on HDL2 but increased the HDL3-fraction. If the protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption is mediated by high-density lipoprotein, it may not be accounted for by changes in the HDL2-fraction. The observed increases in the concentration of the HDL3-fraction, however, suggest that this subfraction may not be inert with respect to coronary disease and could possibly have a role in the protective effect."

The results indicate that stress is detected at a higher frequency in patients with NIDDM than in healthy controls, and that blood glucose and lipid metabolic factors are significant explanatory variables for this stress.

All had persistent hyperglycemia after a preliminary 3-month period with dietary and life-style modification. Gliclazide (80 to 320 mg/d) was then prescribed as diabetic pharmacotherapy for 2 years. Additional therapy for hypertension and dyslipidemia was started if necessary. The aim of the study was mainly to determine the feasibility of a GP-directed protocol for the monitoring and treatment of newly diagnosed NIDDM patients, and to assess the effectiveness of diabetic therapy in this cohort. Diabetes was diagnosed in 78% of the cohort during routine screening. Among the women, 6.5% had a history of gestational diabetes. Eighteen percent of the patients had a parental history of diabetes, and the dominant maternal role in the genesis of NIDDM was confirmed. High blood pressure (Joint National Committee V criteria) was found at inclusion in 38.8% of the whole cohort. Hyperlipidemia was known in 44.6%. A history of stroke was present in 1.6% of the patients, and coronary heart disease (CHD) in 6.3%. These data support the relationship between the atherogenic state and development of NIDDM. Microalbuminuria defined as urinary albumin excretion (UAE) of at least 20 mg/L was found in 29.6% of the patients, and retinopathy in 9.8%. Among the included patients, 23% did not complete the study and were excluded from the efficacy analysis. Of these, 14% (808 patients) had only baseline evaluation data and 9% (499 patients) withdrew later. Comparison of mean baseline and final results in study completers uncovered a significant improvement in fasting blood glucose ([FBG] 182 +/- 48 v 137 +/- 40 mg/dL), post prandial blood glucose ([PPBG] 209 +/- 68 v 162 +/- 52 mg/dL), and hemoglobin A1c ([HbA1c] 8.7% +/- 2.5% v 7.3% +/- 2.0%). A slight improvement in total cholesterol (228 +/- 44 v 222 +/- 41 mg/dL), body mass index ([BMI] 28.5 +/- 4.7 v 27.9 +/- 4.5 kg/m2), and waist to hip ratio (0.99 +/- 0.1 v 0.98 +/- 0.1) was observed. There was a decrease in the percentage of patients with high blood pressure (38.5% v 30.7%). A mild increase in the prevalence of retinopathy (10.2% v 11.8%) was noted during the study, while the incidence of microalbuminuria remained unchanged (30.2% v 29.5%). In conclusion, the data indicate that the GPs involved in this study were able to successfully monitor and manage NIDDM patients in accordance with a standardized protocol. Gliclazide appeared to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment. The high prevalence of chronic diabetic complications at diagnosis emphasizes the delay encountered in reaching the diagnosis of NIDDM and the problems associated with this delay. In addition to the classic risk factors for NIDDM exhibited in this patient cohort, we have identified CHD and a maternal genetic component as further potential predicting factors."

In all patients high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio were significantly lower than in the control group; in particular, the ratio was below 0.240 which was the median value of normal subjects. Six patients with total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol below 5.16 and 3.35 mmol/l respectively, had low serum levels of HDL-cholesterol; in 4 of them the value of this risk factor was below 0.9 mmol/l; 2 of 6 patients had a lipoprotein (a) serum concentration above 0.3 g/l but not a premature myocardial infarction or a clinical history of coronary heart disease. Our data confirm that HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol ratio could be a better marker of coronary heart disease than HDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol or LDL-cholesterol and suggest the importance to check HDL-cholesterol serum levels also in subjects without risk factors for atherosclerotic disease."

At 4 weeks, the effects on heart rate, blood pressure and lipids appeared similar and subjects taking a beta-blocker were combined. Compared with placebo, those on a beta-blocker gained 0.5 kg in weight (P = 0.04), heart rate fell from 63 to 52 beats/min (P < 0.0001) and blood pressure fell from 116/74 to 113/69 mmHg (P < 0.005); high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol fell from 1.26 to 1.11 mmol/l (P = 0.005), there being no change in the ratio of free to esterified cholesterol in HDL, and there was an apparent rise in serum triacylglycerols from 1.18 to 1.43 mmol/l (P = 0.15 when adjusted for weight gain). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and lipoprotein (a) did not change. In this study, the oxidizability of LDL was unaffected by beta-blocker therapy. beta-blockade was not associated with any change in LDL fatty acid profile, or beta-carotene or alpha-tocopherol content which might account for the reduced LDL oxidizability previously reported in patients treated with beta-blockers. Furthermore, neither atenolol nor propranolol, at concentrations up to 100 mumol/l, had any effect on in vitro oxidizability of LDL obtained from healthy volunteers. 3. In contrast to the favourable haemodynamic effects conferred by beta-blockers, the effects on weight and serum triacylglycerols and HDL-cholesterol appear to be adverse and we did not demonstrate any changes in lipid oxidizability which might be relevant to the protective effects of beta-blockers in patients with coronary disease."

Seventy patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia (HT-P), 70 beta-thalassemia trait carriers (TT-C) and 70 sex and age-matched controls were investigated and their plasma lipoprotein profile and apo(a) phenotypes determined. In a subgroup of these same subjects (12 HT-P, 12 TT-C and 24 controls) and in 12 bone marrow-transplanted homozygous beta-thalassemic patients (BMT-P) plasma lipoprotein composition was assessed. HT-P disclosed significantly lower total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo A-I, apo B plasma levels and higher triglyceride concentration than TT-C (-7, -11, -8, -8, -13 and +11%, respectively) or controls (-39, -50, -46, -32, -30 and + 35%, respectively). All lipoprotein subclasses were triglyceride-enriched, while LDLs were also protein-enriched and HDLs protein-depleted. TT-C disclosed a small but significant reduction in apo A-I and apo B plasma levels but only minor lipoprotein abnormalities with respect to the controls. BMT-P lipoprotein composition was intermediate between HT-P and normal subjects. Apo(a) plasma levels did not differ among the groups. A higher prevalence of 'small' apo(a) isoforms was present in HT-P. Within the same 'isoform group', apo(a) plasma levels were significantly lower in HT-P than in TT-C or controls. Since liver cirrhosis is almost always present in HT-P, it is conceivable that an altered hepatic apo(a) synthesis or catabolism due perhaps to diminished apolipoprotein glycation may be involved. In TT-C a partially improved cardiovascular risk profile was apparent (low hematocrit, low LDL-cholesterol and apo B), thus justifying the claim for a low prevalence of ischemic heart disease, but no Lp(a) plasma level modification could be detected."

The Insulin Response to a bolus of intravenous glucose (0.50 g/kg) was significantly correlated with VLDL-Triglyceride (p less than 0.01), VLDL-Cholesterol (p less than 0.01) and with the \"Atherogenic Index\" (Formula: see text) (p less than 0.01). Moreover, stratifing the all population in quartiles according to the Insulin Response distribution, the highest quartile had a significant increase in Total and VLDL-Cholesterol levels (p less than 0.02), as well as in Total (p less than 0.02), VLDL (p less than 0.02) and LDL (p less than 0.01) Triglyceride, in comparison with the lowest quartile. The Atherogenic Index was also significantly elevated in the high Insulin Response group (p less than 0.005). The influence of serum insulin on lipoprotein metabolism was also evaluated by a stepwise multiple regression analysis. Body weight, Insulin Response and Exogenous Triglyceride removal were independently correlated with VLDL-Triglyceride concentration (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001).

Most of the knowledge was derived from the prospective population-based Turkish Adult Risk Factor (TEKHARF) Study, having already a 13 years' follow-up, but data contributed by the Turkish Heart Study were also outlined. In the setting of a prevalence of metabolic syndrome in 3 out of 8 Turkish adults, Turks have low levels of total cholesterol (mean 185 mg/dl), LDL-cholesterol (mean 116 mg/dl), and HDL-cholesterol (mean 37 and 45 mg/dl in men and women). The latter is associated with comparatively high concentrations of triglycerides (mean 143 mg/dl) and of apo B (mean 115 mg/dl). This suggests that small, dense LDL particles (pattern B) prevail in this population though studies are missing in this regard. In line with this notion are the high levels of total/HDL cholesterol ratio (mean 5.3 in men, 4.5 in women). It is remarkable that women exhibit identical LDL-cholesterol levels as men. The lipid parameter that has changed strikingly since 1990 are the rising triglycerides, accompanying a similar trend in (abdominal) obesity. On multivariate analysis, the best independent lipid predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk among Turks is the TC/HDL-C ratio. A 2-unit increment of TC/HDL-C adds an excess of 68% to both the nonfatal and fatal CHD event risk. When ratios of = or >5.5 in men and = or >5 in women are considered as high risk, slightly more than one-third of Turkish adults, corresponding to 12 million adults, are included by these criteria into high-risk group. A major portion of Turkish adults harbouring total cholesterol concentrations in the 180-200 mg/dl range are at high risk, and we stress the opinion that the upper normal limit of total cholesterol be reduced to 180 mg/dl in Turks, at least in men."

LDL turnover was determined by measuring the clearance of [125I]-LDL from plasma over a 10-day period. The LDL residence time, determined using a biexponential model, correlated negatively with the body mass index (BMI) (r = -.73, P<.001) and serum triglycerides (r = - .57, P<.01). There was a significant inverse correlation between LDL residence time and the LDL esterified to free cholesterol ratio in hypercholesterolemic subjects (r = -.94, P<.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between LDL residence time and both hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose in these subjects before treatment (P<.005). After simvastatin therapy, the relationships were no longer significant. Simvastatin treatment was associated with a shorter LDL residence time (P<.01) and a decrease in LDL glycation (P<.001) with virtually no change in diabetic control (HbA1c, 6.0%+/-3.1% v. 6.3%+/-3.3%, NS). This study suggests that a decrease in residence time by upregulation of the LDL receptor with simvastatin alters LDL composition in a way that is likely to render the particle less atherogenic."

Hypertension, obesity, and abnormal albumin excretion were twice as frequent in those with IGT as in 279 men and 240 women of similar age and sex distribution who had normal OGTTs. Plasma cholesterol and TGs were higher, and HDL cholesterol was lower in subjects with IGT than in nondiabetic subjects. Those with IGT had a prevalence of electrocardiographically recognized CHD 9.5-fold greater than the normoglycemic subjects. Subjects with IGT had higher plasma insulin concentrations, but the 1-h insulin-glucose ratio after the 75-g glucose load was lower.

            "abstract": "The pharmacological effects of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) medications on lipoprotein metabolism are difficult to assess in preclinical models because those created failure to replicate the human condition in which insulin deficiency is superimposed on obesity-related insulin resistance. To create a better model, we fed mice with high fat (HF) diet and treated the animals with low dose streptozotocin (STZ) to mimic T2DM. We used this model to evaluate the effects of canagliflozin (CANA), a drug that reduces plasma glucose by inhibiting the sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2), which mediates ~90% of renal glucose reabsorption] on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. After 6 weeks of CANA (30 mg/kg/day) treatment, the increase in total plasma cholesterol in HF-STZ diabetic mice was reversed, but plasma triglycerides were not affected. Lipoprotein fractionation and cholesterol distribution analysis showed that CANA kept HDL-Cholesterol, LDL-Cholesterol, and IDL-Cholesterol levels steady while these lipoprotein species were increased in placebo- and insulin-treated control groups. CANA treatment of HF-STZ mice reduced post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity at 2 (-40%) and 5 (-30%) weeks compared to placebo. Tissue-specific LPL activity following CANA treatment showed similar reduction. In summary, CANA prevented the total cholesterol increase in HF-STZ mice without effects on plasma lipids or lipoproteins, but did decrease LPL, implying a potential role of LPL-dependent lipoprotein metabolism in CANA action. These effects did not recapitulate the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on lipids and lipoproteins in human, suggesting that a better murine T2DM model (such as the ApoB100 humanized CETP-overexpressing mouse) is needed next."

Ten normolipidemic, normoponderal non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients and seven controls received a 980 kcal meal containing 78 g lipids with 100 000 IU vitamin A. Chylomicron clearance was not different, but area under the curve (AUC) for retinyl palmitate in chylimicron-free serum (remnant clearance) was greater in patients (P < 0.02). LCAT activity increased postprandially to the same extent in both groups.

In NIDDM patients, on the contrary, CETA which was 35% higher in the fasting state (P < 0.005), decreased postprandially yet HDL2-CE remained unchanged. Postprandial HDL3 of controls were enriched with phospholipid (PL) (30.3 +/- 2.6% at 6 h) with respect to fasting (25.6 +/- 2.5%, P < 0.01) and to NIDDM-HDL3 (25.8 +/- 1.7% at 6 h, P < 0.01). These results show that variation in plasma CETA has little impact on HDL2-CE in NIDDH subjects. They support the concept that, in controls, the combined enrichment of HDL3 with PL, increased LCAT and CETA create the conditions for stimulation of cell cholesterol efflux and CE transfer to apo B lipoproteins. In NIDDM, because of the lesser HDL3 enrichment with PL and of the inverse trend of CETA, these conditions fail to occur, depriving the patients of a potentially efficient mechanism of unesterified cholesterol (UC) clearance, despite their strictly normal preprandial profile."

We have examined the effect of glycemic control (as assessed by hemoglobin A1 levels) on the concentrations of plasma lipoproteins and apoproteins in 109 patients with type I diabetes mellitus.

The strongest correlation was between HbA1 and plasma levels of apoprotein B (r = 0.57; P less than 0.001). We have also examined the effect of long-term improvement in glycemic control (achieved with insulin infusion pump therapy) on plasma lipoproteins in six patients with type I diabetes. Patients were followed for 5 to 12 months, with mean (+/- SD) HbA1c levels decreasing from 11.4 +/- 2.5 to 9.1 +/- 1.8. Most, but not all, patients showed reduction in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels and increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol levels, but these did not reach statistical significance. Only the decrease in plasma apo B levels was statistically significant (from 112 +/- 38 mg/dL before pump therapy to 91 +/- 33 mg/dL at the end of the follow-up, P less than 0.05). We conclude that glycemic control plays an important role in regulating the levels of plasma LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides in patients with type I diabetes. Apoprotein B is a particularly sensitive indicator to alterations in glycemic control. It is possible that tight glycemic control may have \"antiatherogenic\" effects through reduction of apo B levels."

The level of low-density lipoproteins(LDL) cholesterol remains the marker for treatment initiation and for evaluation of therapeutic goals. The total number of atherogenic particles is a better determinant of cardiovascular risk than the LDL-cholesterol level, as are the levels of non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. The use of apolipoprotein B by primary care physicians is limited by the lack of standardization and must be restricted to specific clinical cases. Non-HDL-cholesterol can be recommended as a secondary target in patients with high triglyceride levels.

Although both postural hypotension and the coefficient of variation of R-R interval tended to improve in the MIT group, they deteriorated in the CIT group. In conclusion, intensive glycemic control by multiple insulin injection therapy can delay the onset and the progression of diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy in Japanese patients with NIDDM. From this study, the glycemic threshold to prevent the onset and the progression of diabetic microangiopathy is indicated as follows; HbA1c < 6.5%, FBG < 110 mg/dl, and 2-h post-prandial blood glucose concentration < 180 mg/dl."

However, around one-third of nuts consumed are roasted and salted. Thus, it is important to determine whether roasting and salting nuts affect the health benefits observed with raw nuts. This study aimed to compare the effects of consuming two different forms of hazelnuts on cardiovascular risk factors and acceptance.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using a randomised crossover design, 72 participants were asked to consume 30 g/day of either raw or dry roasted, lightly salted hazelnuts for 28 days each.

High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (P = 0.037) and triacylglycerol (P < 0.001) concentrations were significantly lower following the consumption of dry roasted, lightly salted hazelnuts when compared to the raw hazelnuts. Compared with baseline, consuming both forms of hazelnuts significantly improved HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 concentrations, total-C/HDL-C ratio, and systolic blood pressure without significantly changing body composition.

LPL activity correlated indirectly with lipemia, triglyceride content of HDL2, HL activity, and levels of HDL2 but not of HDL3. HL activity correlated directly with lipemia and indirectly with HDL2 levels. Triglyceride content of HDL2 correlated directly with lipemia and indirectly with HDL2 levels. In HDL2, abundance of apolipoprotein (apo) A-II and the apoA-I/apoA-II ratio varied widely. The latter correlated positively with LPL activity and HDL2 levels, and, inversely, with HL activity, lipemia, and triglyceride content of HDL2. The study suggests that HDL-cholesterol is not an independent parameter of lipid transport, but is strongly affected by triglyceride metabolism through lipolytic enzymes, as exemplified by postprandial lipemia that affect both composition and plasma levels of HDL2."

In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, FER(HDL) alone accounted for 38 and 40% of the variability in LDL-size in male and female CHD patients, respectively. Other parameters accounted for an additional 6-10%. With respect to the relation between FER(HDL) and HDL subfractions, FER(HDL) related only to HDL2-C (males: r = -0.640, females: r = -0.652, P < 0.001). This result suggests that FER(HDL) is better able to predict the presence (or absence) of large HDL, rather than that of small HDL.

Recent studies have found the ACE D allele to be associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. This association has not been evaluated in prospective studies. We therefore studied the relationship between ACE gene I/D polymorphism and CHD in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) evaluated for 9 years. The I/D polymorphism was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Overestimation of the frequency of the DD genotype was eliminated by insertion-specific primers and inclusion of 5% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Eighty-three patients were evaluated for a mean period of 9.1 years (range, 7.4 to 10.5). Among them, 64 patients showed no CHD at entry. During the follow-up period, 21 patients (37.5%) developed CHD. The systolic blood pressure (P = .046), fasting blood glucose (P < .01), and prevalence of hypertension (P < .001) increased, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P < .001) decreased. Patients who developed CHD were older than those who did not; the mean age was 59.3 and 53.2 years, respectively (P = .003). The prevalence of albuminuria at follow-up examination was higher in CHD subjects versus non-CHD subjects (61.9% v 20.9%, P = .012). The D allele of the ACE gene was significantly more frequent in subjects with CHD versus those without CHD in both follow-up (P = .028, chi2 test) and cross-sectional (P = .033, chi2 test) settings. No difference could be detected between the three genotypes in age, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, or plasma lipid levels. In our logistic regression analysis, the best model selected the DD genotype (P = .0105) and age (P = .0407) as significant risk factors for CHD. This model classified 89% of the subjects correctly. In conclusion, this 9-year prospective study supports the hypothesis that the ACE I/D polymorphism is an important and independent risk factor for CHD in patients with NIDDM."

            "abstract": "Patients with Type 2 diabetes are at increased risk from macrovascular disease whether or not they are hyperlipidaemic. Several factors may contribute to this increased risk including abnormalities of lipoprotein composition. The aim of our study was to determine the effects of lipid lowering drugs on lipoprotein composition (lipoprotein fractions were separated by sequential flotation ultracentrifugation) and insulin sensitivity (measured by a modified Harano technique) in 44 patients with mild hyperlipidaemia. All patients had total cholesterol concentrations between 5.2 and 6.5 mmol l-1 and total triglyceride concentrations < 3.0 mmol l-1, and were randomized by minimization to receive treatment for 12 weeks with bezafibrate, acipimox, simvastatin or placebo. Total cholesterol concentrations were decreased by simvastatin, 5.7 +/- 0.4 to 3.7 +/- 0.6 mmol l-1 (p < 0.05), due mainly to reduced LDL-cholesterol levels (-1.25 mmol l-1; p < 0.05), and bezafibrate 5.7 +/- 0.6 to 4.6 +/- 0.4 mmol l-1 (p < 0.05). The LDL:HDL-cholesterol ratio was reduced in the simvastatin group 2.0 +/- 0.5 to 1.2 +/- 0.3 (p < 0.005). There was no effect of the drugs on glycated haemoglobin or insulin sensitivity. In conclusion bezafibrate and simvastatin improve the lipid profile in Type 2 diabetic patients without adversely affecting diabetic control."

The children had been randomly selected and serve as an urban reference population. Only in boys did serum triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol increase significantly with age, whereas the other lipoprotein-lipids remained almost constant during adolescence. LDL-cholesterol was found to be higher and HDL-cholesterol lower than in American children, suggesting that Danish children may be more prone to develop coronary heart disease in adult life."

In both countries, variables associated with CAD were age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, family history of myocardial infarction (MI), tobacco consumption, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-I and B levels. Logistic regression analyses were conducted using standardized odds ratios. The strength of the associations with CAD was rather similar in the two countries (Northern Ireland versus France) for age [1.26 (1.10-1. 45) vs. 1.41 (1.17-1.69)], family history of MI [1.50 (1.04-2.15) vs. 1.83 (0.99-3.37)], hypertension [1.49 (1.13-1.97) vs. 1.67 (1.14-2. 44)], diabetes [5.42 (2.53-11.60) vs. 2.24 (1.06-4.73)], tobacco consumption [1.43 (1.27-1.60) vs. 1.39 (1.22-1.58)], HDL-cholesterol [0.80 (0.68-0.94) vs. 0.86 (0.70-1.06)] and triglyceride levels [1. 17 (1.01-1.36) vs. 1.10 (0.91-1.32)].

Soybean-protein diet, legumes, nuts and soluble fibre significantly decrease total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Diets rich in fibre and complex carbohydrate, and restricted in fat, improve control of blood glucose concentration, lower insulin requirement and aid in weight control in diabetic patients. An inverse association has been reported between nut, fruit, vegetable and fibre consumption, and the risk of coronary heart disease. Patients eating a vegetarian diet, with comprehensive lifestyle changes, have had reduced frequency, duration and severity of angina as well as regression of coronary atherosclerosis and improved coronary perfusion. An inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption and stroke has been suggested. Consumption of fruits and vegetables, especially spinach and collard green, was associated with a lower risk of age-related ocular macular degeneration. There is an inverse association between dietary fibre intake and incidence of colon and breast cancer as well as prevalence of colonic diverticula and gallstones. A decreased breast cancer risk has been associated with high intake of soy bean products. The beneficial effects could be due to the diet (monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, minerals, fibre, complex carbohydrate, antioxidant vitamins, flavanoids, folic acid and phytoestrogens) as well as the associated healthy lifestyle in vegetarians. There are few adverse effects, mainly increased intestinal gas production and a small risk of vitamin B12 deficiency."

The CKD-5D patients had significantly lower cholesterol, LDL-c and ox-LDL levels and significantly higher ox-LDL-AB and Hcy levels versus their respective controls. The reduction in ox-LDL in CKD patients does not imply a lower risk of atherosclerosis. In fact, the risk may be higher due to a greater capture of ox-LDL by macrophage scavenger receptors, which are increased in these patients. Elevated Hcy levels may also be a risk factor for atherosclerosis in male and female CKD-5D patients."

            "abstract": "Small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL) and remnant lipoproteins are potent atherogenic lipoproteins, often elevated in the plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes. The alpha1-blocker doxazosin has been reported to favorably affect the plasma lipid profile. We examined whether doxazosin could reduce these atherogenic lipoproteins in hypertensive subjects with and those without type 2 diabetes. Seventeen nondiabetic hypertensive patients and 33 hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes were studied. Doxazosin (2 to 4 mg) was administered alone or with other previously received antihypertensive drugs for 6 months. Mean LDL size was measured by 2% approximately 16% gradient gel electrophoresis. Remnant-like particle (RLP)-cholesterol was measured with the use of an affinity column containing anti-apoA1 and B100 monoclonal antibodies. Doxazosin effectively decreased blood pressure (BP) without significantly affecting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), or C-peptide levels in both nondiabetic and diabetic patients. Doxazosin significantly reduced triglyceride, apo CIII, and apo B, but did not alter total-, LDL- or HDL-cholesterol. Mean LDL particle diameter was significantly increased from 25.6+/-0.6 nm to 25.9+/-0.4 nm (P < .001) by doxazosin treatment, regardless of the presence of diabetes. Consequently, the prevalence of small dense LDL (<25.5 nm) was halved in both groups. The increase in LDL size significantly correlated with decrease in triglyceride level (r=-0.798, P < .0001). Doxazosin significantly reduced RLP-cholesterol in both groups. These results suggest that doxazosin may help to prevent coronary artery disease by reducing atherogenic lipoproteins, including small dense LDL and remnant lipoproteins, in hypertensive patients, regardless of the presence of diabetes."

The objective of the study was to determine prevalence rates of NIDDM among a representative sample of the Kuwaiti adult population aged 20 and older in two out of five governorates and identify the associated risk factors for the disease. A total of 3003 subjects (1105 men and 1898 women) were interviewed and examined by the research team during the period September 1995 to June 1996. A specially designed questionnaire was completed and the physical examination included height, weight and blood pressure measurements. Fasting blood samples were withdrawn, centrifuged immediately and refrigerated. Interpretation of oral glucose tolerance tests were based on the World Health Organisation diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus (1985). The denominator used for computing the prevalence was obtained from the 1995 Kuwait census. The overall prevalence of NIDDM in this study was found to be 14.8% (14.7% in men, 14.8% in women). Diabetic subjects presented at a relatively young age, prevalence rate in the age group 20-39 was 5.7% (95% confidence interval, 4.4-7.0) and in the age group 40-59 was 18.3% (95% confidence interval, 16.1-20.6). Obesity was found to be a significant risk factor, P < 0.001. The strong association of family history of NIDDM (adjusted odds ratio = 1.80, P < 0.001) suggests a genetic component. Hypertension was markedly associated with NIDDM and IGT (P < 0.001). With the demographic transition which already started among the Kuwaiti population and if the prevalence of NIDDM remains the same, aging of the population will contribute to even more upward trends in prevalence of abnormal glucose tolerance with its serious impact on morbidity and mortality among the Kuwaiti population. The strong association between hypertension and NIDDM may suggest a common approach to the prevention and control of these two conditions."

In addition, these same measurements were made before and for three hours after the noon meal on days 14 and 15. Fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG concentrations were significantly increased (P less than 0.005) on the low-fat-high-carbohydrate diet.

            "abstract": "Elevated plasma triacylglycerol concentrations have been associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In the past, the epidemiologic evidence about the causal role of triacylglycerols in CHD has not been well regarded, but recent prospective evidence shows that nonfasting plasma triacylglycerol concentration is a strong and independent predictor of future myocardial infarction. Elevated plasma triacylglycerol concentrations are associated with other CHD risk factors, namely reduced HDL-cholesterol concentrations and a preponderance of highly atherogenic, small, dense LDL particles. Plasma triacylglycerol concentrations increase after the ingestion of a fat-containing meal, and elevated postprandial triacylglycerolemia leads to a series of metabolic reactions that reduce HDL-cholesterol concentrations and promote the formation of small, dense LDL particles. The magnitude of the postprandial response is largely determined by fasting plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Metabolism of plasma triacylglycerols also influences postprandial factor VII activation and the postprandial lipemic responsiveness to dietary cholesterol. Therefore, dietary factors that improve fasting plasma triacylglycerol concentrations must have a role in a healthy diet. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids are n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in fish oil that effectively reduce plasma triacylglycerol concentrations. Because n-3 PUFAs are effective at low doses (1 g n-3 PUFA/d), they provide a realistic option for the optimization of plasma triacylglycerol metabolism."

During the 1-year follow-up coronary events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, coronary artery by-pass surgery) occurred in 48 patients. The severity of CAD, overweight, smoking and beta-blockade influenced the Lp-pattern. Chol-, TG- and Apo-B-levels were highest in the group with a coronary event. Apo-B turned out to be the second best predictive variable in multiple regression analysis, in men. In women no such analysis was done because of very few coronary events during follow-up. Nevertheless, the exercise test variables, ST depression and pain were more predictive of coronary events than Apo-B in men."

            "abstract": "In 72 obese women body mass index positively correlated with age and both showed multiple correlations with serum lipids and lipoprotein lipids. After adjustment for age (partial correlation procedure), body mass index resulted to be positively correlated with serum triglycerides, VLDL lipids, HDL-triglycerides and negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol. The decrease in HDL-cholesterol concentration along with the increase in body weight was due to the reduction of cholesterol in HDL2 subfraction, while HDL3-cholesterol did not show any significant correlation with body mass index. The negative correlation between HDL2-cholesterol and body mass index was independent of other lipoprotein variables and in particular of VLDL lipid levels that were, as expected, inversely related to HDL2-cholesterol. HDL2-cholesterol is believed to be a strong protective factor against atherosclerosis, while doubts exist on the meaning of VLDL lipids as risk factors. Thus, the decrease in HDL2-cholesterol concentration, rather than the increase in VLDL lipids, might give a rational basis to the high incidence rate of vascular disease in obese subjects."

The 24-h plasma glucose profiles and lipid and HbA1c levels were measured at the beginning and end of the study, and the incidence and severity of hypoglycemic episodes were closely monitored.

The insulin dose was 80 +/- 9 U/day (0.86 +/- 0.10 U/kg). Improved glycemic control was confirmed by a reduction in HbA1c (10.9 +/- 0.05 vs. 7.2 +/- 0.2%, P < 0.001) and mean 24-h glucose (17.2 +/- 0.2 vs. 7.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l, P < 0.001).

Postprandial plasma TG responses were significantly larger in both NIDDM groups than in the healthy control group. The most marked differences were observed in the Sf 60-400 lipoproteins, whether measured as TG or RP responses. However, there were no differences between the DM+CAD+ and DM+CAD- groups. The between-group differences in alimentary lipemia were only partially explained by fasting TG levels. In contrast to the healthy subjects, no significant negative correlation was observed in the NIDDM patients between alimentary lipemia and lipoprotein lipase activity, implying an abnormality of the lipolysis of TG-rich particles in NIDDM. Levels of atherogenic postprandial remnant lipoproteins are increased in NIDDM.

There were two study groups: patients with hypertension, whose plasma lipid profile was similar to their respective controls, and patients with hypoalphalipoproteinemia (hypoalpha), whose family members served as controls. Values for FERHDL were significantly higher in both risk groups than in their respective controls. LP AI was significantly decreased only in the hypoalpha subjects. Generally, LP AI and FERHDL were inversely related. LP AI correlated strongly with plasma HDL-cholesterol, apo AI, and LP AI/AII; FERHDL correlated with those values inversely. LP AI, but not FERHDL, correlated with HDL free cholesterol. On the other hand, FERHDL correlated strongly with plasma concentrations of triglycerides and with the plasma ratio of total/HDL-cholesterol while LP AI did not. GGE determination of the composition of HDL subspecies showed that both FERHDL and LP AI were significantly related to the content of HDL2b particles: FERHDL inversely, LP AI directly; the relative amount of HDL3b,c particles correlated only with FERHDL. We conclude that GGE and FERHDL can be used to quantify both the apparently protective (HDL2b) and risk-associated (HDL3b,c) particles, whereas the concentration of LP AI in plasma mainly reflects the concentration of the HDL2 subpopulation."

Before lovastatin therapy, the patients had an extremely delayed catabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) without evidence of overproduction of lipoproteins in this fraction. Three of four patients had elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) that were due mainly to increased production rates for LDL. In the three patients treated with lovastatin, the drug therapy lowered plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and raised high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Lovastatin therapy decreased VLDL-triglycerides primarily by enhancing their catabolism, and lowered LDL-cholesterol levels mainly by reducing input rates for LDL. Overall, lovastatin appears to be an effective drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome."

In groups with abdominal obesity, mean annual hemoglobin A1 was significantly (P less than .01) higher than in patients without an abdominal fat distribution. Atherogenic index was significantly increased in the group with the highest WHR and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol) levels were significantly decreased in both groups with upper-body fat distribution.

Blood pressure (BP), biochemical variables and vascular parameters (stiffness and intima-media thickness) were analysed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      According to WHO and CDC references, 48% and 43% of the children, respectively, were categorised as obese, whereas 16% were considered as obese using the Spanish Reference Criteria. Applying WHO criteria, obese children showed significantly higher levels of insulin, homeostasis model assessment index and most vascular parameters, as well as lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol than overweight children. Moreover, overweight children showed higher BP, insulin and uric acid, and lower HDL-cholesterol than normal weight children. The CDC criteria yielded similar results, although with fewer differences between obese and overweight children. Applying Spanish criteria, the differences between obese and overweight children disappeared.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      WHO and CDC BMI-for-age references and cut-offs are useful for defining obesity and being overweight in children because they clearly identify metabolic and vascular comorbidities. The Spanish Reference Criteria underdiagnose obesity because overweight children show comorbidities typical of the obese."

            "abstract": "We investigated the relation of plasma lipids to the risk for ischemic stroke by comparing clinical and biochemical characteristics of survivors of cortical (n = 48) and lacunar (n = 36) brain infarction. By analysis of variance, no differences were observed in the concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, or apoproteins A1 and B. Patients with lacunar infarction, however, had higher concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol than patients with cortical stroke. This HDL-cholesterol difference was due primarily to a strikingly low HDL-cholesterol content in white patients with cortical stroke. These data suggest that previously demonstrated differences in HDL-cholesterol concentrations between patients with ischemic stroke and control subjects without stroke may apply to patients with cortical but not lacunar infarction. Separation of cerebral infarction into subtypes based on mechanism may help clarify lipid-related risk factors in cerebrovascular disease."

The 7 days of exercise did not result in significant changes in body weight or maximal oxygen uptake. Plasma glucose concentration at 120 min averaged 227 +/- 23 mg/dl in an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and 170 +/- 18 mg/dl after the 7 days of exercise (P less than .001). There was a 36% reduction in the area under the glucose tolerance curve. Plasma insulin concentration at 120 min of the OGTT averaged 172 +/- 27 microU/ml before and 106 +/- 13 microU/ml after 7 days of exercise (P less than .001); the area under the insulin curve was decreased by 32%. In contrast to the response to 7 days of exercise, one bout of exercise did not result in an improvement in glucose tolerance. These results provide evidence that regularly performed, vigorous exercise can be effective in decreasing insulin resistance and improving glucose tolerance within 7 days in some patients with mild NIDDM."

In 20 NIDDM patients, aged 34 to 67 (mean, 53.6) years, without clinical signs of atherosclerotic disease and whose blood sugar level was over 140 mg/dl after four weeks of dietary treatment, fasting blood samples were taken before the beginning of the trial, after four weeks of dietary treatment, and after four and eight weeks of combined dietary and glibenclamide treatment. Pretrial levels of total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the diabetic patients did not differ from those in nondiabetic controls, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and the percentage of TC bound to HDL (HDL-C%) were significantly lower in the patients than in controls. After combined dietary and glibenclamide treatment and the normalization of blood sugar, both HDL-C (mg/dl) levels and HDL-C% levels increased significantly. TC, TG, and LDL-C levels decreased. Levels of apolipoproteins A1 and A2 rose and apolipoprotein B fell, but differences were not significant. TXB2 and 6-keto-PGF1-alpha (the inert metabolites of TXA2 and PGI2) and B-TGL were determined by radioimmunoassay. TXB2 and B-TGL levels decreased significantly after glibenclamide administration, indicating attenuation of platelet aggregation. No changes in PGI2 were observed. The results demonstrate the favorable effect of glibenclamide on lipoproteins and apolipoproteins in NIDDM patients, especially in increasing HDL-C levels and HDL-C%, and in attenuating platelet aggregation as indicated by reduction of TXB2 and B-TGL."

To date, no data are available regarding how serum copper affects cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in children and adolescents. We examined the association between serum copper levels and CVD risk factors in children and adolescents. We analyzed data consisting of 1427 subjects from a nationally representative sample of the US population in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2014. The CVD risk factors included total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin, fasting insulin, and blood pressure. Multivariate and generalized linear regressions were performed to investigate associations adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, poverty:income ratio (PIR), BMI, energy intake, and physical activity. We found significant associations between serum copper and total cholesterol (coefficient = 0.132; 95% CI 0.081, 0.182; P for trend < 0.001), glycohemoglobin (coefficient = 0.044; 95% CI 0.020, 0.069; P < 0.001), and fasting insulin (coefficient = 0.730; 95% CI 0.410, 1.050; P < 0.001) among the included participants.

Studies in which patients experienced approximately 10% or less weight reduction were selected for review. Studies indicated that, for obese patients with NIDDM, hypertension or hyperlipidemia, modest weight reduction appeared to improve glycemic control, reduce blood pressure, and reduce cholesterol levels, respectively. Modest weight reduction also appeared to increase longevity in obese individuals. In conclusion, a large proportion of obese individuals with NIDDM, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia experienced positive health benefits with modest weight loss. For patients who are unable to attain and maintain substantial weight reduction, modest weight loss should be recommended; even a small amount of weight loss appears to benefit a substantial subset of obese patients."

In this study we analyse: 1) the relation of glycaemic control with the concentrations of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecules-1 (VCAM-1) and ICAM-1 in NIDDM patients: 2) whether metabolic control can affect the oxidative stress (as measured by plasma hydroperoxide concentration and susceptibility of LDL to in vitro oxidation) and hence the adhesion molecule plasma concentrations. Thirty-four (19 males and 15 females) poorly controlled NIDDM patients were studied. All parameters were evaluated at the beginning of the study and after 90 days of dietary and pharmacological treatment. The treatment decreased HbA1c (p < 0.001), E-selectin (p < 0.001), plasma hydroperoxides (p < 0.003) and the susceptibility of LDL to in vitro oxidation (lag phase) (p < 0.0001). Before treatment HbA1c, lag phase and lipid hydroperoxides correlated with E-selectin plasma concentration (r = 0.51, -0.57 and 0.54, respectively, p < 0.01). There was also a correlation between HbA1c and lag phase (p < 0.01) and between HbA1c and lipid hydroperoxides (p < 0.01). In addition, the variations of HbA1c, lag phase and lipid hydroperoxide values correlated with those for E-selectin concentration after 90 days' treatment (r = 0.54, -0.64 and 0.61, respectively, p < 0.01). In multiple linear correlation analysis, however, the partial correlation coefficients of HbA1c (basal and variations) with E-selectin concentration (basal and variations) fell to non-significant values (r = 0.12 and 0.25, respectively) when LDL lag phase and plasma hydroperoxides were kept constant. The results indicate that the improvement of metabolic control in NIDDM patients is associated with a decrease of E-selectin plasma levels; they also suggest that glycaemic control per se is not directly implicated in determining E-selectin plasma concentration; glycaemic control could affect E-selectin concentration through its effect on oxidative stress."

Dyslipidemias are a major contributor, but the mass occurrence of CVD relates to the combined effects of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. Total blood cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol relate to CVD risk in an independent and graded manner and fulfill the criteria for causality. Therapeutic reduction of these lipid fractions is associated with improved outcomes. There is good evidence that HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and Lp(a) relate to CVD although the evidence for a causal relationship is weaker. The HDL association with CVD is largely independent of other risk factors whereas triglycerides may be more important as signaling a need to look intensively for other measures of risk such as central obesity, hypertension, low HDL-cholesterol, and glucose intolerance. Lp(a) is an inherited risk marker. The benefit of lowering it is uncertain, but it may be that its impact on risk is attenuated if LDL-cholesterol is low."

The main importance of these lipid/metabolic disorders lies in their assumed contribution to an increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). In the general population increased levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] constitute an independent risk factor for CHD by itself as well as in combination with increased levels of cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, respectively. Two hundred and fifty-six patients with 27 +/- 7 months HAART and 84 treatment-naive HIV-1 positive patients were screened for cardiovascular risk factors. The subjective perception of fat wasting and/or accumulation in different sites of the body, which was possible to evaluate in 235 patients on HAART and 73 treatment-naive patients, the levels of plasma triglycerides (TG), cholesterol, LDL and high-density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol, LDL/HDL ratio and Lp(a) were measured. Of the patients on HAART, 42% (98/235) reported abnormal fat distribution as compared with 4% (3/73) of the treatment-naive patients (P<0.0001). The levels of TG, cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, but not HDL-cholesterol or Lp(a) were higher (P<0.0001) in the HAART group as compared with the naive group. Very high Lp(a) levels (> 700 mg/l) were more common among HAART patients as compared with naive, 14% (36/256) vs 2% (2/83); P=0.0022. The Lp(a) levels correlated to the levels of LDL-cholesterol, but not to total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol or TG, and did not differ between patients with and without subjective perception of abnormal fat distribution. A significant number of the HAART patients had very high levels of Lp(a) and various combinations of increased lipid values associated with considerably increased risk for CHD.

The euglycemic (80 mg/dl) hyperinsulinemic clamp (insulin infusion rate 1.12 mU/kg per min) was performed and the average glucose infusion rate (GIR) during a steady-state euglycemia was determined as a measure of IR. Hypertension was more common among NIDDM patients with an increased IR and was highest in the group of patients with CVD. CVD-RF such as hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol and obesity tended to cluster in the NIDDM patients who had lower GIR values and higher fasting IRI levels. GIR values were compared between a set of groups extracted from the 135 NIDDM patients that were matched for age, sex, body mass index and HbA1c levels. The CVD-positive group had the significantly lower GIR value than the CVD-negative group (2.06 +/- 0.66 vs. 3.45 +/- 1.75, P < 0.005). The GIR value was also significantly lower in the hypertriglyceridemic group compared with the normotriglyceridemic group (2.50 +/- 1.36 vs. 4.03 +/- 1.82, P < 0.0005). However, there was no significant difference between the hypertensive and normotensive groups and between the high cholesterol or low HDL-cholesterol groups and their respective control groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that IR contributes to the clustering of CVD-RFs which may accelerate the development of CVD in the subgroup of Japanese NIDDM patients."

Statistical analysis was done with the t-test. The group of patients affected by gout had significantly higher levels of triglycerides and VLDL-C and lower levels of HDL-C than the population of healthy subjects. The change of the lipoprotein pattern observed in the patients suffering from gout may be linked to reduction of the catabolism of the triglycerides rich lipoprotein.

The correlations between chol-HDL and apoA-I were about the same with these methods (r = 0.79 and 0.80). The correlation between the precipitation methods and ultracentrifugal analysis for chol-HDL was highly significant (r = > 0.95). Correspondingly, two common precipitation methods for the determination of LDL-cholesterol in human serum, buffered heparin, and polyvinyl sulphate procedures, produced sediments, which contained the major proportion of the apoB and only small amounts of apoA-I and apoA-II. However, yields of only 69.0-80.2% were obtained for apoB from the sediments and of 85.8-89.4% from supernatants calculated as the difference from chylomicron free serum. This difference might be due to alterations of the molecular structure of apoB by the precipitation reagents. Comparison of the results with the precipitation methods to those using the Friedewald formula showed excellent agreements (r = > 0.91). Very comparable results were also obtained in the case of marked hypertriglyceridaemia provided that the serum samples were briefly centrifuged before analysis of chol, chol-HDL, and triglyceride values for the formula of chol-LDL. The precipitation methods for chol-LDL showed very good agreement with the values obtained by ultracentrifugal analysis (r = > 0.93). There were no remarkable differences in the correlation of apoB and chol-LDL values measured by different methods (r = 0.85). According to the present results it was found that highly significant correlations existed between chol/chol-HDL or chol-LDL/chol-HDL and apoB/apoA-I ratios (p < 0.001).

The polymorphism of the beta 3-AR gene was determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The Trp64Arg allele of the beta 3-AR gene was significantly more frequent in the NIDDM patients with PDR (P = 0.002), but not in those with non-PDR (P = 0.151), than in NIDDM patients without diabetic retinopathy.

            "abstract": "The effect of metformin treatment was studied in nine patients with mild (fasting plasma glucose concentration less than 7.5 mmol.l-1) non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and fasting plasma triglyceride (TG) concentration greater than 2.0 mmol.l-1. Individuals were studied before and three months after receiving 2.5 g/day of metformin. Mean hourly plasma glucose concentration from 8 AM to 4 PM (7.5 +/- 0.5 vs 6.5 +/- 0.4 mmol.l-1, p less than 0.001), as well as glycosylated hemoglobin levels (7.0 +/- 0.5 vs 6.2 +/- 0.2%, p less than 0.02) were significantly lower following metformin treatment. The improvement in glycaemic control was not associated with an improvement in insulin stimulated glucose disposal as measured by the glucose clamp technique. Mean hourly day-long concentrations of plasma insulin (519 +/- 81 vs 364 +/- 64 pmol.l-1, p less than 0.001), FFA (502 +/- 45 vs 460 +/- 35 mu mol.l-1, p less than 0.01), and triglyceride (3.60 +/- 0.33 vs 3.02 +/- 0.31 mmol.l-1, p less than 0.001) concentrations were significantly lower following three months of metformin treatment. Finally, fasting plasma TG concentration, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG, and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations were significantly decreased, while high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration was significantly increased following metformin therapy. Thus, metformin administration to individuals with NIDDM, who did not have significant fasting hyperglycaemia, led to a decrease in plasma glucose, insulin, FFA, and TG concentration, and an increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In Caucasians, a smaller LDL size was more prevalent in men and associated with a higher body mass index, hypertension prevalence, and plasma total- and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, but lower HDL-cholesterol. In African-Americans, a smaller LDL size was associated with higher triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol and hypertension prevalence. In Caucasians, Subclass B prevalence was 29.1% among cases and 14.8% among controls. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for Subclass B rather than Subclass A in Caucasian cases was 2.94 (1.67-5.17); the association remained significant after controlling for age, body mass index, smoking, and either plasma triglycerides or HDL-cholesterol. In African-Americans, however, there was no significant association between LDL subclass and case status. A predominance of smaller LDL particles is associated with asymptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis in Caucasians, through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated."

Eighty middle-aged, non-obese, normotensive, untreated men with urinary albumin excretion rates below 20 microg/minutes, beta2-microglobulin excretion rates below 140 microg/minutes and creatinine clearance values exceeding 80 ml x min(-1) x (1.73 m2)(-1) were included in this study. Three groups were defined according to the results of 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as follows: D group, 10 subjects with NIDDM; B group, 40 subjects with \"borderline glucose tolerance test\" and N group, 30 subjects with normal glucose tolerance. The fractional clearance (theta) of Cerulo, but not albumin and IgG, was elevated in 37. 5% of the B group compared with the upper limit of that of the N group. Furthermore, theta-Cerulo and theta-IgG increased in the D group compared with those of the N and the B groups. Recently, we found that theta-Cerulo and theta-IgG increased in healthy volunteers when GFR was elevated by acute protein loading and that increase in theta-Cerulo is remarkable than increase in theta-IgG. The present result, taken together with our recent finding mentioned above, suggests that increases in theta-Cerulo and theta-IgG may not be due to an impairment of charge selectivity in the glomerular basement membrane, but due to an increase of intraglomerular hydraulic pressure."

Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22 weeks.\n## RESULTS\nForty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications. Including all participants, HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P = 0.089). Excluding those who changed medications, A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan group compared with 0.38 points in the ADA group (P = 0.01). Body weight decreased 6.5 kg in the vegan group and 3.1 kg in the ADA group (P < 0.001). Body weight change correlated with A1C change (r = 0.51, n = 57, P < 0.0001).

By contrast, there were no changes in the serum lipoproteins of the pair-fed controls. The prevention of alcoholic hypertriglyceridemia was associated with marked attenuation of the alcoholic fatty liver and it occurred despite a slight increase in fat absorption. Thus, the administration of polyenylphosphatidylcholine not only attenuates the hepatotoxicity of ethanol, but also increases the HDL/LDL cholesterol ratio, which may be beneficial for the prevention of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease."

Other recent findings relating to this syndrome include evidence of elevated concentrations of small and dense LDL micelles (< 25 nm), so-called LDL phenotype B, which are easily modified (e.g. by oxidation, glycation etc.), and subsequent uptake by \"scavenger\" receptors into macrophages which after filling become foam cells and penetrate into the vascular wall. Elevated levels of small and dense LDL micelles, the accelerating process of atherogenesis, were proved in all multiple metabolic syndrome carriers.

Thus, novel strategies to reduce CVD risk in T2DM patients are needed. The recently published BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) study demonstrated that in T2DM patients with high CVD risk empagliflozin reduced the primary major adverse cardiac event end point (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke) by 14%. This beneficial effect was driven by a 38% reduction in CV mortality with no significant decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke. Empagliflozin also caused a 35% reduction in hospitalization for heart failure without affecting hospitalization for unstable angina. Although sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors exert multiple metabolic benefits (decreases in HbA1c, body weight, and blood pressure and an increase in HDL cholesterol), all of which could reduce CVD risk, it is unlikely that the reduction in CV mortality can be explained by empagliflozin's metabolic effects. More likely, hemodynamic effects, specifically reduced blood pressure and decreased extracellular volume, are responsible for the reduction in CV mortality and heart failure hospitalization. In this Perspective, we will discuss possible mechanisms for these beneficial effects of empagliflozin and their implications for the care of T2DM patients."

Serum Lp(a) levels of NIDDM patients and non-diabetic members of the same family who had the same apo(a) phenotypes were compared, while case control subjects were chosen from high-Lp(a) non-diabetic and low-Lp(a) nondiabetic groups with the same apo(a) phenotypes in the same family. Serum Lp(a) levels were significantly higher in NIDDM patients than in non-diabetic subjects (39.8 +/- 33.3 vs 22.3 +/- 19.5 mg/dl, p < 0.05). The difference in the mean Lp(a) level between the diabetic and non-diabetic groups was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than that between the high-Lp(a) non-diabetic and low-Lp(a) non-diabetic groups. An analysis of covariance and a least square means comparison indicated that the regression line between serum Lp(a) levels [log Lp(a)] and apo(a) phenotypes in the diabetic patient group was significantly (p < 0.01) elevated for each apo(a) phenotype, compared to the regression line of the control group. These data together with our previous findings that serum Lp(a) levels are genetically controlled by apo(a) phenotypes, suggest that Lp(a) levels in diabetic patients are not regulated by smaller apo(a) isoforms, and that serum Lp(a) levels are greater in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic family members, even when they share the same apo(a) phenotypes."

            "title": "Coronary heart disease risk factors in women.",
            "abstract": "Despite the obvious predominance of coronary heart disease in middle-aged men, cardiovascular disease including coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular accidents is currently the major cause of death in women (54% cardiovascular mortality, 46% coronary mortality; 28% of all deaths). Before menopause, coronary heart disease is infrequent which suggests that female hormones and metabolism offer protection. Without hormone replacement therapy after menopause women may develop coronary atherosclerosis. Ageing is among the non-modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease in women, while genetic predisposition and environmental factors remain controversial. The modifiable risk factors are mostly common to both sexes and include heavy cigarette smoking (especially in women under oral contraception) dyslipidaemia, high blood pressure, and diabetes; some factors are peculiar to women. The delayed onset of coronary heart disease in women, roughly 10 years later than in men, and greater feminine longevity (81 years vs 74 in men on average) points to the potential benefit of post-menopause hormone replacement therapy together with reduction of other modifiable risk factors. After menopause, the protective HDL cholesterol decreases whereas high LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides and high blood pressure are major risk factors for coronary heart disease as well as for cerebrovascular accident. The role of hormone replacement therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women is still controversial despite the results of meta-analyses which suggest a 25% to 44% reduction in coronary heart disease following oestrogen therapy alone or in combination with progestogen, depending on the hormonal regime. In conclusion, menopause, now considered as the marker for the end of natural protection against coronary heart disease, should be followed by early and prolonged combined hormone replacement therapy in order to reduce the low compliance with long-term hormone replacement therapy."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nAlthough therapeutic diets are critical to diabetes management, their acceptability to patients is largely unstudied.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo quantify adherence and acceptability for two types of diets for diabetes.\n## DESIGN\nControlled trial conducted between 2004 and 2006.\n## SUBJECTS/SETTING\nIndividuals with type 2 diabetes (n=99) at a community-based research facility. Participants were randomly assigned to a diet following 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines or a low-fat, vegan diet for 74 weeks.\n## MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nAttrition, adherence, dietary behavior, diet acceptability, and cravings.\n## STATISTICAL ANALYSES\nFor nutrient intake and questionnaire scores, t tests determined between-group differences. For diet-acceptability measures, the related samples Wilcoxon sum rank test assessed within-group changes; the independent samples Mann-Whitney U test compared the diet groups. Changes in reported symptoms among the groups was compared using chi(2) for independent samples.\n## RESULTS\nAll participants completed the initial 22 weeks; 90% (45/50) of American Diabetes Association guidelines diet group and 86% (42/49) of the vegan diet group participants completed 74 weeks. Fat and cholesterol intake fell more and carbohydrate and fiber intake increased more in the vegan group. At 22 weeks, group-specific diet adherence criteria were met by 44% (22/50) of members of the American Diabetes Association diet group and 67% (33/49) of vegan-group participants (P=0.019); the American Diabetes Association guidelines diet group reported a greater increase in dietary restraint; this difference was not significant at 74 weeks. Both groups reported reduced hunger and reduced disinhibition. Questionnaire responses rated both diets as satisfactory, with no significant differences between groups, except for ease of preparation, for which the 22-week ratings marginally favored the American Diabetes Association guideline group. Cravings for fatty foods diminished more in the vegan group at 22 weeks, with no significant difference at 74 weeks.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nDespite its greater influence on macronutrient intake, a low-fat, vegan diet has an acceptability similar to that of a more conventional diabetes diet. Acceptability appears to be no barrier to its use in medical nutrition therapy.\n"

Metabolic parameters such as body composition, blood pressure (BP), fasting glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine 4 (fT(4)) were measured. During a mean follow-up of 3 yr, 5,998 Koreans ages over 18 yr were assessed. There were 694 cases of MetS at follow-up. The mean age of the subjects was 45.6 ± 9.5 yr. Mean level of TSH was 2.02 ± 1.50 mIU/L, mean level of fT(4) was 1.23 ± 0.20 ρM/L. At baseline, TSH levels and fT(4) levels were associated to waist circumference, BP, glucose and lipids in the subjects. Increase in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol and TG were significantly associated with changes in TSH levels after adjustment. Changes in DBP, TG, HDL-C and fasting glucose were significantly associated with changes in fT(4) levels after adjustment. Increase in TSH levels even after further controlling for baseline TSH level predicted the MetS over the study period. In conclusion, there is a relationship between thyroid function and cardiovascular risk factors, such as BP, total cholesterol, TG, HDL-C and fasting glucose. Also, higher levels of TSH may predict the MetS in Korean."

The distribution of CETP genotypes was similar to that previously described in the general population. A significant association was found between CETP genotype and both CETP and HDL cholesterol (HDL-c) concentrations. B1B1 had the highest CETP and the lowest HDL-c whereas B2B2 had the lowest CETP and the highest HDL-c. However, HDL-c was not correlated with CETP concentration, even when genetic groups were separately considered. By multivariate analysis, the determinants of HDL were body mass index, triglycerides concentration, net mass CE transfer, and CETP genotype. No association was found between CETP genetic groups and HDL or LDL size distribution. In contrast, net mass CET was positively and HDL and LDL sizes were negatively correlated with plasma triglyceride concentration. Overall, our work demonstrates that, in a population of diabetic patients where lipoprotein-related parameters vary over a large range, the association of CETP gene polymorphism with HDL-c is independent of plasma CETP concentration."

Lathosterol was higher in fathers than in mothers, but not different between boys and girls. In each of these four groups, there was a strong correlation with plasma and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and -triglyceride, as well as with body weight, but not with height or high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In adults, lathosterol was inversely correlated with plant sterols. Lathosterol was higher in children with E4/3 phenotype than in those with E3/3 or E3/2; in adults, lathosterol did not differ among the various E phenotypes. The plasma levels of the two plant sterols, campesterol and beta-sitosterol, were highly correlated with each other, and also with plasma or LDL-cholesterol, in each of the four groups.

Serum adiponectin levels were positively associated with HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size, and negatively associated with triglycerides and apo B. Negative associations were also found between adiponectin and body mass index (BMI), percent body fat, and IR,as determined by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).

Together, these variables explained 19% of adiponectin variability in the 2 models. HOMA IR did not emerge as a determinant of adiponectin in both models.

The body mass index (BMI) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) were calculated as well.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      BMI, serum lipids and insulin levels were significantly higher, whereas serum apelin and glucose levels were lower in the pregnancy group compared to the control group. There was a significant negative correlation between apelin and adiponectin, in both groups. Additionally, apelin was negatively correlated with ox-LDL and HDL-cholesterol in the pregnancy group.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although strongly correlated with adiponectin, apelin cannot be used as a marker of insulin sensitivity, but it could serve as a marker of oxidative stress in pregnancy."

We evaluated the effect of etofibrate on the LDL-subtype distribution in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 13, 55 +/- 18 years, BMI 27.9 +/- 5.5 kg/m2, HbA1c 10.1 +/- 3.9 %) and diabetic dyslipoproteinemia (triglycerides 343 +/- 253 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 36 +/- 7 mg/dl, LDL-cholesterol 110 +/- 37 mg/dl). Plasma lipids (enzymatic methods) and LDL-subtypes (7 LDL-subfractions, density gradient ultracentrifugation) were measured before and during etofibrate therapy (500 mg/d, 7 - 16 weeks). Etofibrate significantly (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon-test) reduced triglycerides (- 31 +/- 60 %) and increased HDL-cholesterol (+ 24 +/- 22 %), whereas total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol did not change. Cholesterol concentration decreased in sd-LDL by 12 % (p < 0.05), while it increased in id- and lb-LDL (+ 26 %,+ 39 %, respectively). Thus, the LDL-subtype profile showed a relative increase of the fraction of lb- (+ 13 +/- 32 %, n.s.) and id-LDL (+ 23 +/- 33 %, p < 0.05) and a relative decrease of the fraction of sd-LDL (- 19 +/- 18 %, p < 0.05).

Protective lipid markers against cardiovascular disease were studied in 98 obese normolipidaemic, non diabetic, non-smoker subjects over 18 years of age according to regional distribution of adipose tissue as estimated by the waist ship ratio (WHR) and overall obesity as estimated by the body mass index (BMI). WHR was inversely correlated with Lp AI (r = 0.46) and HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.37). BMI was not correlated with protective lipid parameters but only with triglycerides. After adjustment, Lp AI was lower in men and in upper body obese women (p < 0.05). Lp AI is a better indicator of body fat distribution than HDL-cholesterol or apo AI, and its variations appear to be indirectly related to gender, menopause, and age, thereby influencing body fat distribution (the main factor accounting for Lp AI variation). Lp AI was inversely correlated with WHR in gluteal-femoral obese women but not in abdominally obese women or men, possibly because of a threshold effect."

            "abstract": "The changes in total serum cholestrol, serum triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol after twenty eight (28) days of consumption of moderate quantity of a commercial coffee preparation (NESCAFE brand) were studied in 30 human subjects consisting of 20 male and 10 female healthy adults. Significant increases in the mean total serum cholesterol concentration (110.8-126.5 mg/100 mls) and LDL- cholesterol concentration (78.4-94.5 mg/100 ml) were observed in the subjects. No significant differences were obtained in the mean HDL cholesterol concentration and in the mean serum triglyceride levels. The differences observed in the mean total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in the individual male and female groups studied were not statistically significant. The results from this study suggest that short-term consumption of coffee may increase the total serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. It is therefore possible that long-term consumption of coffee may lead to clinically significant alterations in serum lipid profile and could be important in the aetiology of atherosclerotic vascular diseases such as coronary heart disease."

While analytical quality of total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and HbA1c is satisfactory, improvements are needed for HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, Lp(a), and LpPLA2 measurements. Biological variation is a strong player in the lipid diagnostics, because reference change value is above 20 % for majority of biomarkers.

Lifestyle counseling and estrogen replacement therapy have all been proposed as first-line measures, but there is no agreement on the best way to treat climacteric dyslipidemia.

Serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, apo A-I, apo B and lipoprotein (a) were determined before and after a 12-week diet modification. Seventy-seven women completed the trial. Both soy and placebo determined a significant reduction in total cholesterol (-0.42 +/- 0.79 and -0.40 +/- 0.57 mmol/L) and LDL-cholesterol (-0.35 +/- 0.72 and -0.31 +/- 0.54 mmol/L), but only soy had a significant lowering effect on apo B and the LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio (-6% and -8% from baseline respectively); lipoprotein (a) plasma levels were not significantly changed by either treatment. Forty-four women were dyslipidemic at baseline; those with increased LDL concentrations showed a somewhat greater improvement in their lipoprotein profile (LDL-cholesterol and apo B reduction) with soy rather than placebo. No further information emerged when the subjects were divided into three apo E phenotypes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude that diet supplementation with 60 g ISP is slightly better than caseinate in favorably modifying the lipoprotein metabolism of postmenopausal women; this effect is more evident in hypercholesterolemic subjects."

A cross-sectional comparison was made of the distribution of plasma lipids and lipoproteins in groups of 41 male and 43 female long distance runners versus larger control groups matched for age and sex, randomly selected from northern California towns. The runners showed modestly lower total cholesterol concentrations, while their triglyceride levels were only 50% of control. HDL-cholesterol was higher in runners than controls (75 +/- 14 vs 56 +/- 14 mg/100 ml for women; 64 +/- 13 vs 43 +/- 10 for men), while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower (113 +/- 33 vs 124 +/- 34 for women; 125 +/- 21 vs 139 +/- 32 for men). All differences were statistically significant (p less than 0.05), and only partially attributable to known factors other than high physical activity level. Since the runners were predominantly normotensive, relatively lean, and exclusively nonsmokers, they appear to constitute a remarkably favored group with respect to risk of cardiovascular disease."

Recently, a new apolipoprotein encoded by the APOM gene, which plays an important role in affecting the intrinsic properties of HDL, has been reported. Genetic variations exist in the APOM gene, but their significance is presently unclear. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether the APOM T-855C mutant allele is implicated in coronary artery disease (CAD). 2. In the present study, 418 patients with CAD and 372 controls were studied, all of whom were Han Chinese from Jiangsu Province, China. Plasma levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were evaluated. Genomic DNA from the whole blood from these subjects was subjected to polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion to determine genotype with respect to the APOM T-855C polymorphism. 3. The allelic frequencies were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Plasma HDL levels were significantly lower in subjects with CAD than in control subjects (1.08 +/- 0.31 vs 1.25 +/- 0.32, respectively; P < 0.001) and the distribution of genotypes and allelic frequencies was significantly different in the two groups (P = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). Multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustment for age, gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension and serum glucose showed that, compared with the wild-type TT genotype, carriers of the C allele had an increased risk of CAD (odds ratio = 1.819, 95% confidence interval 1.142-2.898; P = 0.012). 4. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the APOM T-855C polymorphism carries an increased risk for CAD in this Chinese population."

The mean follow-up time was 36 months (range 13-55 months). The cumulative incidence of NIDDM was 34% (95% CI 16.9-45.1). In multiple logistic regression analysis, cardiovascular risk factors at baseline did not predict the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to NIDDM, in contrast with the two-hour plasma glucose level (odds ratio 3.56, p < 0.001) and the fasting proinsulin level, as one of the determinants of beta-cell dysfunction (Odds ratio 2.1, p < 0.05).

When the entire group was stratified by diabetes treatment (untreated n = 89, diet n = 75, oral agents n = 82, insulin n = 25) and after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and waist-hip ratio, only fasting and 2-h plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were significantly different across treatment groups, with diet and oral agents being associated with higher fasting (P less than 0.001) and postglucose (P less than 0.005) plasma glucose levels and lower plasma insulin concentrations (P less than 0.005) compared with newly diagnosed patients. Neither serum lipids nor blood pressure differed across treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In NIDDM patients under home-life conditions, higher serum triglycerides are associated with higher fasting and postglucose hyperglycemia regardless of antidiabetic treatment. The presence of obesity, hypertension, or high serum cholesterol levels is not associated with significant changes in glycemic control."

At one year follow-up the mean weight had fallen from 120 to 105 to 100 kg, respectively. In spite of severe overweight, only a moderate hypertriglyceridaemia (males mean fasting concentration of plasma triglycerides (TG) 2.50 +/- 1.36, females 2.03 +/- 1.94 mmol/l) was found before treatment. After 6 weeks significant reductions were found in VLDL-TG, -cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.05 at least). After one year VLDL-TG was still below pretreatment level, LDL-cholesterol had increased above pretreatment level, whereas HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher compared to pretreatment (P less than 0.05). Some previous studies suggest that weight loss may lead to HDL-cholesterol reductions, which would be undesirable. The present study indicates that after sustained weight loss and at a stable lower body weight, HDL-cholesterol levels may increase above pretreatment levels after an initial drop during the catabolic weight reduction phase."

HDL-P, LDL-C/HDL-P and HDL-C/TC were also significant, but the other lipid parameters were not. The study indicates that HDL-C, by itself, is not as effective a predictor of CAD as HDL-P/TC.

The findings from the IVUS examinations were related to mean HbA(1c) collected prospectively over 18 years. Abnormal exercise ECGs were found in 15% of patients, and angiographic diameter stenosis of >50% in one or more of the main coronary arteries was found in 34% of patients. All patients examined with intracoronary ultrasound had developed atherosclerotic plaques with an increased intimal thickness (>0.5 mm) in one or more of the coronary arteries. Coronary artery plaque formation, as judged by ultrasound, was significantly related to mean HbA(1c) during 18 years (P < 0.05) after adjustment for total cholesterol and age.

Furthermore, large genetic studies show evidence of remnant cholesterol as a causal risk factor for IHD independent of HDL-cholesterol levels. Genetic studies also show that elevated remnant cholesterol is associated with low-grade inflammation, whereas elevated LDL-C is not.

Cholesterol level in VLDL, LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 fractions was determined after separation of these fractions by density gradient ultracentrifugation. HDL-cholesterol is the sum of cholesterol in HDL2 and HDL3. Cineangiography yielded scores for CAS and for left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF). On univariate regression CAS was correlated weakly with LDL-cholesterol (positive) and with HDL3-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol (negative), and more strongly with LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (positive), but not with HDL2-cholesterol. LVEF was correlated positively with HDL3-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apo-AI, and apo-AII. Of other \"risk factors,\" none was correlated with CAS, and a history of previous myocardial infarction (PMI) was the only one significantly correlated with LVEF. CAS itself was also correlated negatively with LVEF. In multiple regression analysis with two or three independent variables, the relation of HDL(3)-cholesterol with CAS remained significant when other risk factors were taken into account. LVEF remained related positively with HDL(3)-cholesterol, apo-AI, or apo-AII, when either of them was tested in combination with other risk factors; of these only PMI made a significant independent contribution. Conclusions for this patient group (with low HDL-cholesterol): HDL3-cholesterol, and not HDL2-cholesterol, is informative for CAS; HDL(3)-cholesterol, apo-AI, or apo-AII, as well as CAS and PMI, are associated with LVEF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The aim was to study the effect of different low dose supplementations of n-3 fatty acids on the plasmalipid- and lipoprotein composition and to determine a threshold of effectiveness. Significant reduction of the triglyceride level was registered in all subjects with the greatest decrease in those patients who presented with the highest base levels. The cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol values on average remained almost unchanged, apart from a significant increase of LDL-cholesterol in patients with type IV hyperlipoproteinaemia. The HDL-cholesterol fraction also showed a significant increase in type IIb patients which was related to alterations of the HDL-3 subfraction. The minimal effective dose of a daily administration of omega-3 fatty acids can be expected between 0.18 g and 0.35 g. The observed changes of plasmalipids and lipoproteins reflect the beneficial effect of long-chain polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids in respect to plasma-triglyceride reduction and HDL-cholesterol increase as seen in other studies, despite the use of supplementations far below 1 g per day."

The reverse was true with variables such as HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, high levels of which are known to be cardioprotective by virtue of controlling reverse cholesterol transport. The mean values of triglyceride and total/HDL-cholesterol ratio were significantly elevated in the boys with positive parental history of CHD as compared with those with negative parental history.

The association between RPA and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was positive (p < 0.05), while there was no association to total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol or triglycerides. Approximately 80% of the patients received pharmacological treatment (oral antidiabetic drugs and/or insulin) without differences between RPA groups.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      More than half of the adolescents with T2DM did not perform RPA. Increasing physical activity was associated with a lower HbA1c, a lower BMI-SDS, a higher HDL-cholesterol, but not with a difference in treatment regime. These results suggest that regular exercise is a justified therapeutic recommendation for children and adolescents with T2DM."

HDL2 subclass was isolated from the supernatant and its cholesterol content was measured enzymatically. Plasma HDL3 cholesterol was calculated as the difference between results for total HDL cholesterol and HDL2 cholesterol.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      NIDDM patients with CAD had significantly higher triglyceride levels compared to either control (217.09+/-55.04 versus 89.62+/-31.29 mg/dl, P=.001) or CAD patients without NIDDM (217.09+/-55.04 versus 156.28+/-46.39 mg/dl, P<.05). However, in the diabetic patients with CAD, there was a statistically significant decrease in HDL cholesterol (39.63+/-8.59 versus 55.86+/-13.49 mg/dl, P<.01), HDL2 cholesterol (8.74+/-3.28 versus 16.95+/-5.73 mg/dl, P<.001), and HDL3 cholesterol (31.23+/-7.41 versus 38.91+/-8.93 mg/dl, P<.05) in comparison to nondiabetic controls. Moreover, in the comparison between non-insulin-dependent diabetics with CAD and CAD subjects without NIDDM, HDL cholesterol (39.63+/-8.59 versus 46.13+/-6.33 mg/dl, P<.05) and HDL2 cholesterol (8.74+/-3.28 versus 11.84+/-4.01 mg/dl, P<.02) were significantly reduced, while HDL3 cholesterol levels were (31.23+/-7.41 versus 34.29+/-7.94 mg/dl, P=.92) unaltered. Additionally, the percentage reduction of cholesterol in HDL2 fraction was proportionately greater than the decrease in HDL3 subclass in both comparisons. Moreover, in NIDDM with CAD, HDL cholesterol was reduced by 29% and 14%, HDL2 cholesterol by 48% and 26%, and HDL3 cholesterol by 20% and 9%, compared relatively to controls and CAD subjects without NIDDM.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In conclusion, HDL2 is the more variable subclass and reflects changes in HDL. This suggests that the protective role of total HDL against CAD is mainly mediated through HDL2 fraction. Therefore, HDL2 might be a better predictor of coronary heart disease than total HDL, in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."

Adiponectin is a hormone derived from adipose tissue which regulates energy metabolism, and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Serum levels of adiponectin are reduced in obesity, hypertension, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Moreover, plasma adiponectin concentration is inversely associated with LDL-cholesterol, TG and is positively related to HDL-cholesterol. Recent studies have indicated that adiponectin has antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic properties. Review of the data confirmed the hypothesis that adiponectin plays an important role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease."

Seventy-seven male patients and 77 cardiovascular disease-free controls, matched for sex, age and body weight were studied. Higher triglyceride and apo B levels with lower HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I levels were found in BP patients in comparison with the controls. Lp(a) levels were slightly, but not significantly, increased. Moreover BP patients presented a significantly higher prevalence of HDL-cholesterol levels below 35 mg dl-1 (49.3% vs 22.1%) and Lp(a) levels above 70 mg dl-1 (10.4% vs 1.3%) than the controls. When patients were divided according to the number of coronary vessels involved (one, two or three), no significant difference was found, with a trend to increase in Lp(a) mean levels and in prevalence of Lp(a) levels above 30 and 70 mg dl-1 in more severely diseased patients. These results suggest that patients with severe coronary artery disease undergoing aorto-coronary bypass surgery show low HDL-cholesterol levels with high triglyceride levels. Moreover Lp(a) levels above 70 mg dl-1 are highly associated with severe coronary vessel stenosis."

Postheparin plasma lipoprotein lipase increased markedly during the exercise period while no change occurred in adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase or lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. In the control group no significant changes occurred in any of the lipid variables.

Cai levels were monitored in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets from obese females with NIDDM; obese, nondiabetic women, and nonobese, nondiabetic women. All subjects were black. Significant and marked elevation of basal Cai levels was observed in platelets from the diabetic subjects when no aspirin was used during platelet isolation. However, no significant differences were observed in Cai between aspirin-treated platelets from women with NIDDM and platelets from nondiabetic women. The rate of the Cai return to basal level after thrombin stimulation was significantly lower in platelets from the diabetic subjects, suggesting an abnormality in platelet Ca extrusion or sequestration in NIDDM. Platelet Cai levels positively correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (LDL/HDL) and fasting blood glucose. These findings suggest abnormalities in platelet Cai homeostasis in NIDDM that are influenced by the serum lipid profile and perhaps glucose."

Comparison of lipid levels by insulin quartile (I < 7.4 IU/1, II 7.4-10.0, III 10.1-15.0, IV > 15.0) showed that total and LDL cholesterol decreased in the highest insulin quartile (P = 0.003).

Hourly glucose and insulin levels were measured during a 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. Lipid profiles including total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, HDL2, HDL3, triglycerides, apoprotein (Apo)A1, ApoB, and Apo(a) were obtained before and after the treatment period. Blood pressure decreased significantly and equivalently in both treatment groups. The glucose and insulin levels and glucose x insulin product at 2 hours after the glucose load increased after 12 weeks of treatment with atenolol compared with the baseline values, but these parameters all decreased after the treatment period with captopril compared with their baseline values. These results indicate an improvement in insulin sensitivity with captopril and a deterioration with atenolol. HDL-cholesterol and HDL3 decreased in the atenolol group but increased in the captopril group.

Upon multivariate analysis of data from 55 women with angiographically assessed CHD differed from 32 women with angiographically excluded CHD, HDL-SPM had the strongest association with the presence of CHD among all HDL-related parameters. It was also the only HDL-related parameter which had a significant and independent correlation with the number of coronary stenoses. As HDL-SPM was previously shown to correlate with cholesterol efflux capacity of plasma, we conclude that reduced cholesterol efflux capacity is an important factor accounting for the inverse association between HDL-cholesterol and CHD."

            "abstract": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) affects approximately 12 million people in the United States. NIDDM is frequently found to coexist with other conditions, such as obesity, dyslipidemia, atherosclerotic vascular disease, and hypertension, which contribute to morbidity and mortality. Although the major clinical objective in the management of NIDDM is to control hyperglycemia, the long-term objective is to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of death in NIDDM patients. Although hyperglycemia may be adequately controlled, risk factors for coronary heart disease may remain unchanged. Treatment with metformin controls hyperglycemia and may have positive effects on cardiovascular risk factors. When used alone or in combination with sulfonylureas, metformin tends to stabilize or decrease weight, maintains or reduces insulin levels, has beneficial effects on plasma lipid profiles, and may also have beneficial effects on blood pressure and the fibrinolytic system."

Data from 650 non-Hispanic white adults who participated in one of two clinical sub-studies (about 2 years after the baseline) of the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) were analysed. Four dietary patters were identified using a validated 204-item semi-quantitative FFQ completed at enrolment into AHS-2: vegans (8·3 %), lacto-ovo-vegetarians (44·3 %), pesco-vegetarians (10·6 %) and non-vegetarians (NV) (37·3 %). Dietary pattern-specific prevalence ratios (PR) of CVD risk factors were assessed adjusting for confounders with or without BMI as an additional covariable. The adjusted PR for hypertension, high total cholesterol and high LDL-cholesterol were lower in all three vegetarian groups. Among the lacto-ovo-vegetarians the PR were 0·57 (95 % CI 0·45, 0·73), 0·72 (95 % CI 0·59, 0·88) and 0·72 (95 % CI 0·58, 0·89), respectively, which remained significant after additionally adjusting for BMI.

            "abstract": "Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) are atherogenic and represent a strong cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the primary target in lipid lowering therapy. However, since many cardiovascular events occur despite an optimal LDL-C, it is necessary to focus on the remaining cardiovascular risk. Treatment of low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and high triglycerides (TG) are options to achieve cardiovascular risk reduction beyond LDL. HDL mediates reverse cholesterol transport and exerts several other athero-protective effects. Epidemiologic evidence has shown that low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) is a strong and independent cardiovascular risk marker. However, since the anti-atherogenic effects of HDL particles rather depend on their functionality rather than on their cholesterol content, an increase in HDL-C concentration does not always have to result in a clinical benefit. Besides established strategies to increase HDL-C, e.g. with fibrates and nicotinic acid, CETP (Cholesteryl ester transfer protein)-inhibition is a promising new therapeutic option. The failure of torcetrapib, the first CETP-inhibitor, seems to be attributed to \"off-target\" effects. Treatment with the newer CETP-inhibitors dalcetrapib and anacetrapib has been shown to be efficacious and safe - but their usefulness in clinical practice remains to be determined in ongoing clinical endpoint trials. TG concentrations have been shown to correlate with cardiovascular risk. However, interpretation of plasma TG concentrations remains difficult due to considerable intra-individual variability of plasma concentrations. Post-prandial triglyceride concentrations may be better predictors of cardiovascular risk than fasting TG. In patients with hypertriglyceridemia, achievement of the LDL-C goal remains the primary lipid target. The basis of therapy in patients with hypertriglyceridemia are life style modifications. In addition, non-HDL-C should be addressed. For selected patients, treatment with fibrates, nicotinic acid or omega-3 fatty acids are available to lower TG concentrations. In summary, the focus of lipid therapy is the reduction of cardiovascular risk rather than the modification of lipoprotein sub-fractions. Ongoing research points towards a shift of the focus from the HDL-C concentrations to parameters of HDL function and from fasting TG to TG kinetics."

To maintain consistency in proportions, insulin resistance was defined as the upper 3/8 of the distribution on the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA), which uses fasting glucose and insulin and a modified Matsuda-DeFronzo index, based on fasting, 1- and 2-h glucose and insulin values. Among metabolic syndrome patients, 57% and 55% were in the upper 3/8 of the distribution for insulin resistance by HOMA and Matsuda-DeFronzo, respectively. Among subjects without the metabolic syndrome, 26% and 27% were insulin resistant by HOMA and Matsuda-DeFronzo criteria. The proportion of patients with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance increased strongly and similarly with increasing body mass index.

            "abstract": "Atherosclerotic vascular diseases are frequently associated with diabetes mellitus. There has been increasing evidence showing that the atherosclerotic diseases in diabetic patients are distinct from diabetic microvascular complications as to their pathophysiology and epidemiology. However, we have no information on the prevalence of asymptomatic atherosclerosis in diabetic patients before the onset of microvascular diseases. In the present investigation, we aimed to evaluate risk factors for the atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients without the microvascular diseases. For this purpose, we evaluated atherosclerotic change of carotid arteries in 125 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients who had neither atherosclerotic vascular diseases nor diabetic microvascular complications. When atherosclerotic change was defined as the mean intima-media thickness (IMT) of >/= 1.1 mm and/or the presence of plaque lesion, 50% of patients had atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries. Risk factors for the carotid atherosclerosis were age, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes treatment. Age and LDL-cholesterol were associated with mean IMT. Age, diabetes treatment, LDL-cholesterol, and hypertension were positively associated with plaque lesion, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was negatively associated with it. Fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), and known diabetes duration remained unassociated with any parameters of asymptomatic atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries. These results indicate that glycemic control is unrelated with asymptomatic atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients without diabetic microvascular complications. Conventional risk factors and diabetes treatment are independently associated with atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries in these patients."

However, their effects on long-term glucose control in diabetes mellitus are less well established. This study examines the effect of 4 months of captopril treatment on blood pressure (BP) and glucose control in 130 subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypertension. Therapy for glycemic control was adjusted during a 3 month period prior to entry into active BP treatment and was not changed during 4 months of captopril administration. Fasting blood glucose and sitting BP were measured before and at 1, 2, 3, and 4 months of captopril monotherapy. Hemoglobin (Hb) A1c, serum electrolytes, creatinine, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured before and at 4 months. There were significant reductions in fasting blood glucose from baseline at 1 month (P < .01) and further stepwise decreases in values at 2, 3, and 4 months. Differences in glucose from month to month were highly significant. HbA1c was stable over a 3-month pretrial period, then decreased (P < .001) from baseline at 4 months of active treatment. Mean serum potassium increased from 4.4 to 4.7 (P < .001) at month 4 and there was an inverse correlation (r = -0.2, P < .025) between changes in potassium and HbA1c. Total serum cholesterol fell (P < .01) at month 4 of treatment. Serum creatinine and blood urea were unchanged, but of 18 patients with mild proteinuria pretrial, 12 of 18 were negative for protein at 4 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "In this study, 52 nonproteinuric Japanese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) were followed from 1985 to 1990 to investigate the rate of development and progression of microalbuminuria and the factors which influence it. In 1985, 34 patients were normoalbuminuric, and 18 patients were microalbuminuric. Five years later, 11 of 34 initially normoalbuminuric patients (32.4%) developed microalbuminuria, and 6 of 18 initially microalbuminuric patients (33.3%) developed overt proteinuria. At the beginning of the study, hypertension existed more frequently in the patients who later developed microalbuminuria (8 of 11, 72.7%) than in the patients who stayed normoalbuminuric (4 of 23, 17.4%). Age-adjusted values of mean blood pressure (+/- SEM) at the beginning of the study in the patients who developed microalbuminuria (98.2 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, n = 11) were significantly higher than those in the patients who stayed normoalbuminuric (87.3 +/- 2.4 mm Hg, n = 23). In six patients who developed overt proteinuria, initial urinary albumin excretion rates (AER) were higher than those in the patients who stayed microalbuminuric, and four patients who presented with initial AER greater than 100 micrograms/min all developed overt proteinuria. These results indicate that, in Japanese patients with NIDDM, the rate of development of microalbuminuria is faster than that reported in Caucasian IDDM, and preexisting hypertension with relatively poor control of blood pressure may be a risk factor for the development of microalbuminuria."

The present study is therefore aimed at determining the effect of diabetic control on prevalence and pattern of DL in Nigerian patients with NIDDM. Thirty six diabetics were followed up for 24 weeks. Indices determined included anthropometric measurements, fasting (FBG) and two hour post prandial blood glucose (2 hours PPBG), together with glycated haemoglobin (GHb) levels, and fasting lipids at presentation, 12 and after 24 weeks of treatment. The prevalence rates of raised total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL) ratio reduced HDL-cholesterol and mixed DL decreased significantly between 0-week and 24 weeks of treatment (57.1% vs 14.3% 50% vs 11.4% and 44% vs 22.2% respectively, P < 0.001 for each). The proportion of patient with elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol also decreased significantly from 21.4% at 0-week to 8.8 after 24 weeks (P < 0.025). On the other hand, the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglycerilaemia were not significantly changed between 0 and 24 weeks (P > 0.05). Patients with DL despite treatment were characterised by higher FBG at 24 weeks of treatment compared with normolipidaemic patients (P < 0.001). It is concluded from this study that improved glycaemic control reduced some dyslipidaemia, and may therefore suffice to correct them in some Nigerian patients with NIDDM."

Subjects from the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study cardiovascular cohort without cardio-metabolic disease and related drug treatments at baseline (n 4071; aged 45-67 years, 40 % men) were included. We applied reduced rank regression on thirty-eight foods to derive patterns that explain variation in response variables measured at baseline (waist circumference, TAG, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin). Patterns were examined in relation to change in cardio-metabolic traits and iMetS in subjects who were re-examined after 16·7 years (n 2704). Two dietary patterns ('Western' and 'Drinker') were retained and explained 3·2 % of the variation in response variables. The 'Western' dietary pattern was inversely associated with HDL-cholesterol and positively with all other response variables (both at baseline and follow-up), but there was no association with LDL at follow-up. After adjustment for potential confounders, the 'Western' dietary pattern was associated with higher risk of iMetS (hazard ratio Q4 v. Q1: 1·47; 95 % CI 1·23, 1·77; P trend=1·5×10-5). The 'Drinker' dietary pattern primarily explained variation in HDL and was not associated with iMetS. In conclusion, this study supports current food-based dietary guidelines suggesting that a 'Western' dietary pattern with high intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages and red and processed meats and low intakes of wine, cheese, vegetables and high-fibre foods is associated with detrimental effects on cardio-metabolic health."

            "abstract": "Obesity is a major risk factor for the development of diabetes and predisposes individuals to hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Together these pathologies increase the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the major cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Worsening trends in obesity and T2DM raise a serious conundrum, namely, how to control blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids when many antidiabetic agents cause weight gain and thereby exacerbate other cardiovascular risk factors associated with T2DM. Further, evidence suggests that some established antihypertensive agents may worsen glucose intolerance. Many patients who are obese, hypertensive, and/or hyperlipidaemic fail to achieve blood pressure, lipid and glycaemic goals, and this failure may in part be explained by physician reluctance to utilize complex combination regimens for fear of off-target effects. Thus, a clear need exists for clinicians to understand the risks and benefits of different pharmacologic, and indeed non-pharmacologic, options in order to maximize treatment outcomes. While intensive lifestyle modification remains an elusive gold standard, newer diabetes targets, including the incretin axis, may offer greater cardiovascular risk reduction than other antidiabetes therapies, although definitive clinical trial data are needed. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide and the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors sitagliptin and vildagliptin effectively lower HbA1c; exenatide and liraglutide reduce weight and blood pressure and improve lipid profiles. Sitagliptin and vildagliptin are weight neutral but also appear to improve lipid profiles. Integration of incretin therapies into the therapeutic armamentarium is a promising approach to improving outcomes in T2DM, and perhaps even in reducing complications of T2DM, such as co-morbid hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Additional long-term studies, including CVD end-point studies, will be necessary to determine the appropriate places for incretin-based therapies in treatment algorithms."

Of these, 260 were competitive athletes in different events between the ages of 17 and 30 years, 37 were amateur sportsmen, and 20 sedentary individuals of the same age served as control. Sixty amateur sportsmen between the ages of 40 to 60 years in different sporting activities were compared with 19 healthy sedentary controls and 19 patients with coronary heart disease of the same age. Independently of age, the physically active tended to have a reduced LDL-cholesterol, the reduction was statistically significant in some events. No relationship was apparent between the type of physical activity and the magnitude of the LDL-cholesterol reduction. In the sportsmen HDL-cholesterol tended to be higher. In the events demanding a high aerobic capacity the elevation was statistically significant. A positive correlation between HDL-cholesterol or HDL-/total cholesterol, respectively, and maximal oxygen uptake was found. In the majority of events the reduction in total serum cholesterol was not statistically significant. The results demonstrate that habitual sporting activity in events with dynamic exercise involving large muscle groups goes along with a lipoprotein pattern, which in epidemiologic studies has been shown to be associated with decreased coronary risk. This effect is independent on age. The necessary amount of training appears to be equivalent to the amount required to produce the cardiovascular adaptations determined to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease."

Five patients (31%) had fasting glucose levels over 6.6 mmol/l and a HbA1C over 7.5%. Six patients (38%) had diabetes mellitus based on an abnormal 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and two additional patients (13%) had impaired glucose tolerance based on an OGTT. Compared to obese individuals, patients with Cushing syndrome had an elevated glucose but no elevated insulin response to the OGTT. Regression analysis showed positive correlations between 24-h urinary free cortisol (UFC) and fasting blood glucose (P < 0.0005), UFC and OGTT glucose area under the curve (AUC) (P < 0.01), and UFC and HbA1C (P < 0.005). UFC levels were negatively correlated (P < 0.05) with OGTT insulin AUC and insulin/glucose ratios. Eleven (69%) patients required anti-hypertensive therapy for blood pressure control. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were elevated in patients with Cushing syndrome compared to obese controls, while LDL and HDL cholesterol, and Lp(a) were similar in the two groups. We conclude that impaired glucose tolerance and/or diabetes in patients with endogenous Cushing syndrome is due to the hyperglycemic effects of cortisol with relative insulinopenia. Thus, Cushing syndrome shares features with both the Metabolic Syndrome X and NIDDM, including impaired glucose uptake, hyperlipidemia and hypertension. However, in Cushing syndrome, a relative insulinopenia occurs, while in Metabolic Syndrome X and NIDDM, insulin excess is observed. In Cushing syndrome, as the hypercortisolemia exacerbates, insulinopenia becomes more paramount, suggesting that cortisol exerts a direct or indirect \"toxic\" effect on the beta-cell."

In fasting state also the blood lipid profile was determined: serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) and apolipoprotein B (apoB). In comparison with the control group, the offspring had significantly lower mean glycaemia on fasting, and non significantly elevated from the 60 min of the test, the significantly higher values of serum IRI and CP in fasting state and at the end of the test (120-180 min), and significantly lower serum CP:IRI molar ratio, expressing the reduced hepatic clearance of insulin. The offspring had significantly higher mean values of serum LDL-cholesterol, and significantly lower of serum HDL-cholesterol and apoAI, not disclosing significant differences in the serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol and apoB with the control group. Only serum HDL-cholesterol was significantly (negatively) correlated wit serum IRI and CP-values. The covariance analysis, eliminating the influence of age, body mass and the secretory activity of pancreatic B-cells, revealed the significant correlation of the presence of parental diabetes with serum levels of LDL-cholesterol (increase), and HDL-cholesterol and apoAI (decrease) in the offspring. These results prove indirectly, that in subjects genetically predisposed to type 2 diabetes, before the manifestation of glucose intolerance are present other effects of insulin resistance, expressed in increased activity of pancreatic B-cells, increased transfer of insulin to extrahepatic tissues, and in changes of concentration/composition of some lipoproteins dues to reduced influence of insulin on the enzymes which control their metabolism."

Ninety-five Japanese female patients (mean age 58.4 +/- 10.4 years) with newly diagnosed T2DM were selected for this study. They were randomly divided into the following 2 groups according to therapy regimens, and examined every month for 6 months after diagnosis. Group A consisted of 54 patients treated with low-dose pioglitazone orally; Group B, the control-group, consisted of 41 patients treated with standard-dose pioglitazone orally. The incidence of peripheral edema was significantly much lower in group A (2/54) than in group B (11/41) (p = 0.0014). In addition, % change of body weight during the 6-month treatment in group A was significantly less than that in group B (p < 0.0001).

All of these smoking-associated changes are in the same direction as those found in adults, with the exception of total cholesterol levels, which are significantly increased in adult smokers. The extent to which mean triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol levels are shifted is significantly greater in the 8- to 19-year-old smokers than in adult smokers. The changes in mean total cholesterol levels among smokers in both age groups represent only the net shifts in the lipoprotein fractions and are therefore likely to be a less sensitive indicator of the possible lipid-related excess coronary artery disease risk in smokers."

This association was independent of the known risk factors smoking, hypertension and diabetes as well as the serum concentrations of total triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, alpha-Lp-cholesterol and pre-beta-Lp-cholesterol. In contrast to these variables the association between Lp(a) and coronary artery disease was dependent upon the serum concentrations of LDL-cholesterol, beta-Lp-cholesterol and total cholesterol.

During an average period of 24.2 days the total cholesterol and the LDL-cholesterol fell for a group of 151 patients who had volunteered to sustain a vegetarian diet for the duration of the clinical rehabilitation, significantly higher by a medium level of 31.1 mg/dl (12.5%) versus 16.9 mg/dl (7%) respectively 27.7 mg/dl (14.5%) versus 11.8 mg/dl (6.5%), as compared to a randomly selected control group of 151 patients. The reductions within the groups were also significant. All of the other laboratory parameters such as lipoprotein (a), fibrinogen, uric acid, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol did not exhibit any diet-related changes. The weight of the adipose patients could be reduced very significantly through a reduction diet consisting of lactovegetarian food by an average of 3.2 kg versus 1.6 kg (as in the case of the normal, omnivorous diet). All of the dependent values, i.e., circumference of abdomen and hip, and \"body-mass-index\" (BMI) showed the same highly significant differences. Even after 1 year approximately two-thirds of the patients of the vegetarian group chose the reduction of meat and meat-products in their diet, of which merely a small part, 5.3%, were faithful to the pure lactovegetarian food. Essentially, the favorable effects on the lipid values persisted. The positive effects on the lipid values, the weight, and the motivation of the group of patients with the lactovegetarian diet allow the general recommendation of this diet for heart patients in the course of their clinical rehabilitation."

Analyses were by intention to treat.\n## RESULTS\nForty-three per cent of participants in the experimental group and 5% of participants in the control group reduced diabetes medication (P < 0.001). Body weight decreased more in the experimental group than in the control group [-6.2 kg (95% CI -6.6 to -5.3) vs. -3.2 kg (95% CI -3.7 to -2.5); interaction group × time P = 0.001]. An increase in insulin sensitivity was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group [30% (95% CI 24.5-39) vs. 20% (95% CI 14-25), P = 0.04]. A reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fat was greater in the experimental group than in the control group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.02, respectively). Plasma adiponectin increased (P = 0.02) and leptin decreased (P = 0.02) in the experimental group, with no change in the control group. Vitamin C, superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione increased in the experimental group (P = 0.002, P < 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Differences between groups were greater after the addition of exercise training. Changes in insulin sensitivity and enzymatic oxidative stress markers correlated with changes in visceral fat.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA calorie-restricted vegetarian diet had greater capacity to improve insulin sensitivity compared with a conventional diabetic diet over 24 weeks. The greater loss of visceral fat and improvements in plasma concentrations of adipokines and oxidative stress markers with this diet may be responsible for the reduction of insulin resistance. The addition of exercise training further augmented the improved outcomes with the vegetarian diet.\n"

            "abstract": "This report describes the results of long-term treatment for blood lipid regulation with a new drug, gemfibrozil (Lopid). During a short-term placebo-controlled phase, gemfibrozil had significantly reduced triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol and the LDL-cholesterol and had significantly increased HDL-cholesterol and the HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol ratio. It had not, however, greatly affected total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. In the long term phase of the study the improvement attained during the controlled phase was maintained. More important, the lipoprotein values that had not shown improvement in the controlled phase showed definite beneficial changes. The types and incidence of adverse reactions during the long term treatment were similar to those observed during the controlled period. The results of the study indicate that gemfibrozil is effective and relatively safe for the long term treatment of lipid irregularities."

The risk of stroke in NIDDM men was about threefold and in NIDDM women fivefold higher than that in corresponding nondiabetic subjects. Previous history of stroke increased the risk of a new stroke event by threefold.

            "abstract": "There is much evidence that altered lipid metabolism contributes to the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). It is generally accepted that there is a direct association between the extent of CAD and total plasma cholesterol, as well as an inverse association between the extent of CAD and plasma HDL-cholesterol. No general agreement exists about the atherogenetic potential of plasma triglycerides and of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Since lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is the key-enzyme in the catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins), we examine the relationship between triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LPL in vitro and in vivo. The concentrations of the main lipoprotein density classes, namely very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), high-density lipoproteins2 (HDL2) and HDL3, are measured by rate zonal ultracentrifugation. The preparation of VLDL, IDL, LDL, HDL2, and HDL3 is performed by sequential ultracentrifugation. The activity of LPL is measured radioenzymatically in a glycerol-based triolein emulsion. It can be demonstrated in vitro that VLDL, IDL, and HDL2 from normal plasma are able to increase LPL-activity in contrast to VLDL, IDL, and HDL2 from hyperlipemic plasma. This difference seems to be caused by an altered composition of apolipoproteins in hyperlipemic lipoproteins. An artificial acidosis in three healthy subjects shows in contrast to alkalotic and neutral blood-pH a significant decrease of LPL-activity. This result seems to be of some interest, since diseases associated with acidotic blood-pH, such as chronic renal disease, diabetes mellitus or chronic alcoholism, show secondary hyperlipemias caused by a deficit of LPL-activity. It can be shown in 15 male patients who produce a secondary type-V hyperlipemia during severe abuse of alcohol, that LPL-activity is decreased significantly as compared to 15 healthy controls. During sober phases, this alcohol-induced hyperlipemia and the impairment of LPL-activity disappears completely. In an other group of 8 male patients, who are not producing severe secondary hyperlipemia during approximately the identical alcohol intake, LPL-activity is also significantly decreased, but the activity of hepatic lipase is significantly increased. This increase of the activity of hepatic lipase seems to protect these patients from the development of secondary type-V hyperlipemia. In 89 male patients with angiographically assessed CAD a very strong inverse association between the activity of LPL and the extent of CAD is found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "By the year 2025, there will be more than 300 million type 2 diabetes sufferers worldwide. This epidemic will be followed by a wave of cardiovascular disease. Diabetes is in fact a serious vascular disease with poor prognosis, and not only a disease characterized by elevated blood glucose. If adequate attention were paid to this, it would be much easier to relieve the burden of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes patients. One important cardiovascular risk factor in type 2 diabetic people is dyslipidemia. This is characterized by low HDL-cholesterol, high serum VLDL-triglycerides, and a preponderance of small, dense LDL. Even slight elevations of LDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetic patients are associated with a substantial increase in cardiovascular risk. The composition of lipid particles in diabetic dyslipidemia is more atherogenic than in dyslipidemia in general. This means in turn that normal lipid concentrations are more atherogenic in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients. Retrospective analyses show that, in terms of protection from cardiovascular endpoints, the benefit of lipid lowering in type 2 diabetic patients is at least as great as in the non-diabetic population. Lowering of LDL-cholesterol is a very attractive target for the reduction of coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetic people."

            "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular complications. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid on plasma glucose and plasma and tissue lipid profiles in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in adult male albino rats of the Wistar strain, weighing 180-200 g, by administration of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg of body weight) intraperitoneally. Rats were randomly divided into seven groups. Group I: control animals (normal, nondiabetic animals), Group II: 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid control, Group III: streptozotocin-diabetic, untreated animals; Groups IV, V and VI: streptozotocin-diabetic animals given 50, 100 and 200 mg 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, and Group VII: streptozotocin-diabetic animals given glibenclamide. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids, were assayed in the plasma besides lipoprotein-cholesterol (high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C)) and tissues (liver, kidney and heart). Total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and phospholipid (LDL-C and VLDL-C in plasma only) levels increased in plasma and tissues significantly, while plasma HDL-cholesterol significantly decreased in diabetic rats. Treatment with 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid prevented the above changes and improved towards normalcy. Thus administration of 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid is able to reduce hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia related to the risk of diabetes mellitus."

Because fish oil has a strong triglyceride lowering effect in case of normolipemic subjects, we investigated the influence of supplementary fish oil diet in patients suffering from NIDDM (n = 19), who until now were not treated by drugs but only by diet. The study was started with a placebo-run-in-period for four weeks (phase I, 6 g rape seed oil capsules/d), followed by a verum period for twelve weeks (phase II, 6 g fish oil concentrate capsules/d), and a wash-out-period for four weeks (phase III, 6 g rape seed oil capsules/d). The fish oil supplementation contained at least 3 g eicosapentenoic and docosahexenoic acid. The lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, blood glucose, and insulin level (fasting and after load test) were checked at the beginning and at the end of each phase. In comparison to the placebo rape seed oil supplementation, the fish oil diet effected a decrease of serum triglycerides by 29%. LDL-cholesterol increased by 9%, HDL-cholesterol by 9% (especially HDL2-cholesterol), and apolipoprotein B by 4%. Apolipoprotein A-I was reduced by 9%. The fasting blood glucose and the glucose load test as the insulin level (fasting and after load test) showed no significant changes at the end of the verum period in comparison to the run-in-phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Lipids, apo A-I and HDL subparticles were measured in 240 subjects with NIDDM and in 248 age and gender matched controls. Subjects with NIDDM had higher triglyceride levels (2.5 +/- 1.8 vs. 1.4 +/- 0.8 mmol/1, P < 0.001), lower HDL cholesterol (0.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/l, P < 0.001), apo A-I (124.7 +/- 22.4 vs. 139.8 +/- 24.1 mg/dl, P < 0.001) and LpAI/AII (82.4 +/- 18.2 vs. 94.9 +/- 16.7 mg/dl, P < 0.001) in comparison to controls.

In a multivariate analysis, apo A-I was found to be the best predictor of CAD in subjects with NIDDM. In conclusion, reduced HDL cholesterol levels found in NIDDM are, principally, due to reduced concentrations of apo A-I and apo A-II-containing particles (LpAI/AII). While LpAI and LpAI/AII levels were lower in NIDDM subjects with CAD, plasma apo A-I is the best predictor of CAD in NIDDM."

            "abstract": "The term \"lipid triad\" or \"atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype\" has been introduced to describe a common form of dyslipidemia, characterized by three lipid abnormalities: increased plasma triglyceride levels, decreased HDL-cholesterol concentrations and the presence of small, dense LDL particles. It has been suggested that the clinical importance of the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype probably exceeds that of LDL-cholesterol, because many more patients with coronary artery disease are found to have this trait than hypercholesterolaemia. There is a body of evidence that therapies effective against plasma HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides are associated with a strong reduction of cardiovascular risk; in addition, hypolipidemic treatment is able to increase LDL particle size and this increment correlates with regression of coronary stenosis. Recently, the Coordinating Committee of the National Cholesterol Education Program suggested that very high-risk patients may benefit from stronger lipid-lowering measures, a category of individuals that includes those with the atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype. Since the therapeutical modulation of each of the three components of the lipid triad is associated with a strong reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events, LDL size measurement may be extended as much as possible to patients at high risk of cardiovascular diseases."

The MI survivors had significantly higher concentrations of total and VLDL-triglyceride and total and LDL-cholesterol than the control subjects. The differences in HDL-cholesterol, and total apolipoproteins A-1 and B were of borderline significance. HDL2 was significantly lower and LDL2 was higher in the MI survivors. There was no difference in HDL3. The differences in lipoprotein subfractions could be ascribed to differences in cholesterol, phospholipid and proteins, but not in triglyceride. The data suggest that the minor HDL2 subfraction shows a closer association with established coronary heart disease than does total HDL-cholesterol.

In contrast, apo E phenotypes E4/4 and E4/3 tend to increase the risk for macroangiopathy in NIDDM patients. The lower prevalence of macroangiopathy in the subjects with E2 was associated with lower plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations and low plasma lipoprotein(a) levels.

This article reports the differences in outcomes between diet groups after the first 6 months of the intervention.\n## RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES\nThe study used a four-group design. Subjects (n = 182) were randomized to a treatment preference group and then to a dietary treatment group. For this report, preference groups were combined to permit comparisons by dietary treatment only (SBT, n = 98; SBT+LOV, n = 84). Additional analyses compared SBT+LOV subjects who were 100% adherent (did not consume any meat, fish, or poultry, n = 47) to those who were <100% adherent (n = 24).\n## RESULTS\nSignificant differences were seen in the baseline to 6-month change scores between the two groups for carbohydrate consumption (p = 0.013), protein consumption (p < 0.001), polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio (p = 0.009), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level (p = 0.013). Among SBT+LOV subjects, those who were 100% adherent experienced greater reductions in weight (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p = 0.026), LDL-C (p = 0.034), and glucose (p = 0.002) and consumed less fat (p = 0.030) compared with those who were <100% adherent.\n## DISCUSSION\nDifferences between dietary treatment groups at 6 months were minimal, most likely because one-third of the SBT+LOV group did not follow the vegetarian diet and because both groups had the same calorie and fat restrictions. SBT+LOV subjects who were 100% adherent were more successful at both weight loss and cholesterol reduction than those who were <100% adherent, suggesting that vegetarian diets are efficacious for weight and cholesterol control.\n"

The three test margarines, which contributed 78% of total fat in the diets, were produced from 70% of butterfat, PHSO, or PHFO, each with 30% of soybean oil. Fat provided about 35% of energy, and trans fatty acids 0.9%, 8.5%, and 8.0% of energy in the butter-, the PHSO-, and the PHFO-diet, respectively. Dietary cholesterol was balanced by the addition of dried egg powder to the PHSO- and the butter-diet; thus all diets contained 420 mg dietary cholesterol per 10 MJ per day. The subjects consumed all three test diets for 19-21 days in a random order (crossover design). The serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol were significantly elevated on the PHFO-diet (mean values 5.42 and 3.94 mmol/L, respectively) compared to the PHSO-diet (5.11 and 3.58 mmol/L, respectively) but not different from those on the butter-diet (5.32 and 3.81 mmol/L, respectively). LDL-cholesterol was significantly reduced on the PHSO-diet compared to the butter-diet. The level of HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower on the PHFO-diet (0.98 mmol/L) when compared to the butter-diet (1.05 mmol/L) and with border-line significance compared to the PHSO-diet (1.05 mmol/L). The ratio of LDL- to HDL-cholesterol was significantly higher on the PHFO-diet (4.20) when compared to both other test diets (3.85 and 3.65, respectively). No significant differences in triglyceride values were observed. Lp[a] increased and apoA-I decreased significantly after consumption of both the PHSO-diet and the PHFO-diet, compared to the butter-diet. In conclusion, our results indicate that consumption of PHFO may unfavorably affect lipid risk indicators for coronary heart disease at least to the same extent as butterfat. To what extent the observed effects are due to the content of monoene trans, diene trans, or to the long chain saturated fatty acids in PHFO remains to be elucidated."

Its origin and development is conditioned by a set of several risk factors. Changes in the spectrum of lipoproteins are one of the well-known, serious risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The results of several authors showed, that the examination of the ratio of some lipoproteins can provide more accurate information about the cardiovascular risk in a given individual than the individual lipid parameters alone. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common form of chronic hepatopathy. The aim of our study was to examine lipoprotein ratios - atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and butyrylcholinesterase/ HDL-cholesterol ratio - in patients with NAFLD and to evaluate their changes in relation to the severity of hepatic steatosis. The study group consisted of 64 patients with hepatic steatosis, 32 men and 32 women. Patients were examined for fatty liver index (FLI), with FLI values above 60.0 signaling the presence of steatosis. From the biochemical parameters, we examined the serum concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols and butyrylcholinesterase activity in patients with fatty liver disease. As the results of our study showed, both basic lipid parameters - total cholesterol and triacylglycerols - were increased in patients with hepatic steatosis compared to the values in the control group (Chol: 3,59 ± 0,16 vs. 5,14 ± 0,14 mmol/l; TAG: 0,85 ± 0,06 vs. 1,86 ± 0,14 mmol/l). Both investigated lipoprotein ratios - AIP and the BChE / HDL-cholesterol ratio were also significantly increased in patients with liver steatosis (AIP: -0,191 ± 0,04 vs. 0,157 ± 0,04; BChE/HDL-C: 3171 ± 123 vs. 4602 ± 291). The value of the BChE/HDL-cholesterol ratio correlated well with the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio (correl.coeff. 0,802) as well as with the atherogenic index of plasma (correl.coeff. 0,702). The findings of elevated AIP and BChE/HDL-C ratios confirmed the hypothesis of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with fatty liver disease. The finding of a significant positive correlation between AIP and BChE/HDL-C on the one hand and fatty liver index (FLI) on the other hand suggests that cardiovascular risk increases with the severity of steatotic liver injury."

            "abstract": "Ageing in industrialised societies is associated with an increasing prevalence of hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular diseases, reduced insulin sensitivity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It has been suggested that hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance and/or hyperglycaemia could play a role in determining and/or exacerbating the hypertension and vascular disease associated with diabetes mellitus and ageing. Insulin-resistant states, such as essential hypertension and NIDDM, as well as \"normal\" ageing, are characterised by similar intracellular ionic defects, i.e. accumulation of cytosolic free calcium and depletion of free magnesium. The importance of calcium and magnesium ions in regulating cell functions is well-known. A rise in cellular free calcium and a depletion in cellular magnesium may induce cellular insulin resistance and vasoconstriction. Ionic levels quantitatively predict the extent of elevated blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HBA1c and hyperinsulinaemic response to oral glucose challenge. We suggest that ionic disturbance might be the missing link responsible for the frequent clinical coexistence of hypertension, atherosclerosis and metabolic disorders. Ageing cells may become more vulnerable to ion disturbances, leading to possible elevation of intracellular free calcium and concurrent magnesium depletion. The \"ionic hypothesis\" of ageing supposes that an alteration in the cellular mechanisms which maintain the homeostasis of cytosolic calcium concentrations may play a key role in the ageing process, and that a sustained accumulation of cellular calcium and/or the depletion of cellular magnesium may also provide the final common pathway for many ageing-associated diseases, including hypertension and NIDDM."

            "abstract": "Based on the data reviewed, it is necessary to conclude that diabetes is associated with profound changes in HDL metabolism. However, once we go beyond this simple generalization, it is apparent that the relationship between diabetes and HDL metabolism is not a simple one. A good deal of the complication evolves from the fact that IDDM and NIDDM seem to affect HDL metabolism quite differently, with the only apparent similarity the fact that plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration can be low in untreated patients with either IDDM or NIDDM. Thus, in patients with IDDM the primary event seems to be related to the insulin-deficient state, which results in a decrease in HDL turnover rate and resultant decline in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration. In contrast, HDL turnover appears to be accelerated, not reduced in patients with NIDDM, and the low plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration is a consequence of the increased turnover rate. In addition, patients with NIDDM are not absolutely insulin deficient, and available evidence suggests that the higher the plasma insulin level, the lower the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration in these patients. The differences noted above in the effect of IDDM and NIDDM on HDL metabolism are of great interest, and, unfortunately, not very well understood. There is, however, one additional difference, which may be of paramount clinical importance. For reasons not totally clear, plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations in patients with IDDM treated with insulin are not lower than normal, and even tend to be higher than these values in a nondiabetic population. Possibly as a result of this phenomenon, there is no evidence that changes in plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration play a role in the development of macrovascular complications in IDDM. Although it is apparent from the considerations discussed in this review that a great deal more needs to be learned about the effect of insulin deficiency on HDL metabolism, changes in HDL metabolism do not appear to be clinically important in patients with IDDM. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be the situation in patients with NIDDM. Plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations are lower than normal in patients with NIDDM, and this finding seems to be related to increased morbidity and mortality from CAD. Furthermore, there is no form of anti-diabetic treatment, irrespective of how effective it has been in achieving glycemic control, that has been shown to substantially increase plasma HDL-cholesterol level. Indeed, it has been difficult to demonstrate a consistent effect of any therapeutic approach on plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between serum sialic acid concentrations and coronary heart disease (CHD) in a cross-sectional study of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--NIDDM patients (n = 145) attending a diabetic clinic were studied. CHD status was assessed by questionnaire and electrocardiogram coding, and potential risk factor assessment included measurement of fasting serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, blood pressure, and urinary albumin excretion rate (AER). RESULTS--Male NIDDM patients with CHD had a higher serum sialic acid level than those without CHD: 2.56 (2.24, 2.72) mmol/l vs. 2.24 (2.18, 2.30) mmol/l, P = 0.01, mean (95% confidence interval). They were also older, had a longer duration of diabetes, had a higher AER, had higher total triglyceride, very-low-density lipoprotein triglyceride and cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) concentrations, and had a lower apolipoprotein A1 concentration. In an age adjusted multiple lipoprotein(a), hypercholesterolemia, and hypertension were associated with CHD. In women, only hypertension treatment was associated with CHD. CONCLUSIONS--There is a strong univariate association between elevated serum sialic acid and CHD in men (but not women) with NIDDM."

            "abstract": "Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus has a substantial genetic component; however, its molecular basis remains largely unknown. The mode of inheritance is likely to be polygenic, with penetrance influenced by environmental factors. Although the familial aggregation of Type II diabetes is acknowledged, there is little data concerning the prevalence of diabetes in the relatives of subjects with diabetes in comparison with the general population, and our objective was to address this question in the defined geographic region of Oxfordshire, England. We studied 139 first degree relatives of 90 probands with Type II diabetes who attended routine diabetes clinics in Oxfordshire and documented the fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concentrations and BMI of these subjects. The probands were selected without regard to family history of diabetes. The control population data were derived from two large-scale Oxford community studies which documented the prevalences of known and newly diagnosed diabetes. The prevalences of newly diagnosed and known diabetes were calculated for each group. The mean BMI, and concentrations of fasting glucose, triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol were compared and prevalence ratios for obesity (defined as BMI > 30 kg/m2), hyperglycaemia (defined as fasting plasma glucose > or = 6.1 mmol/l), and dyslipidaemia (defined as triglyceride > 2.0 mmol/l, HDL < 1.0 mmol/l) were calculated. There was a fourfold higher prevalence of hyperglycaemia in the first degree relatives of subjects with Type II diabetes compared with the control population: the prevalence ratio after adjustment for age, sex and BMI was 4.32 (95 % confidence interval 2.29-8.17). The relatives had a considerably higher fasting plasma glucose concentration than the control population (5.18+/-0.67 mmol/l (mean +/- 1 SD) vs 4.76+/-1.59 mmol/l, p = 0.0001), and this difference remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex and obesity. The relatives were significantly more obese, had higher fasting plasma insulin concentrations and had lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations. In conclusion, there is a strong familial aggregation of hyperglycaemia and obesity in the relatives of subjects with Type II diabetes and these subjects have higher fasting plasma insulin concentrations and lower HDL-cholesterol than the general population. These data indicate the particular relevance of screening the first degree relatives of subjects with Type II diabetes, as intervention strategies which aim to improve the metabolic profile are indicated for a large proportion of these subjects."

Current guidelines recommend diet as first-line therapy for patients with elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. However, what constitutes an optimal dietary regimen remains a matter of controversy. Large prospective trials have demonstrated that populations following plant-based diets, particularly vegetarian and vegan diets, are at lower risk for ischemic heart disease mortality. The investigators therefore reviewed the published scientific research to determine the effectiveness of plant-based diets in modifying plasma lipid concentrations. Twenty-seven randomized controlled and observational trials were included. Of the 4 types of plant-based diets considered, interventions testing a combination diet (a vegetarian or vegan diet combined with nuts, soy, and/or fiber) demonstrated the greatest effects (up to 35% plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction), followed by vegan and ovolactovegetarian diets. Interventions allowing small amounts of lean meat demonstrated less dramatic reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels. In conclusion, plant-based dietary interventions are effective in lowering plasma cholesterol concentrations."

The blood pressure factor was correlated with fatness at age 8 y (eg fat mass estimated from skin folds, r=0.11) and, after adjustment for current size, with birth weight (r=-0.15).

Sudan Black B prestained plasma samples were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels, and HDL:LDL ratios were determined by densitometric gel scan and automatic peak integration. Of the four study groups, the bypass patient group had the lowest mean HDL:LDL ratio; the low ratios were due particularly to reduced levels of HDL2. Chemical analyses indicated that the bypass patient group also had lower mean HDL-cholesterol and higher mean total cholesterol and triglyceride levels than the other groups. When group age and sex differences were taken into account, the bypass group, especially males, also had low ratios.

After 4 weeks run-in period, all patients were randomised in three groups: placebo (n=67), simvastatin (10 mg/day) (n=61) and atorvastatin (5 mg/day) (n=67). Each treatment period lasted 8 weeks. At the beginning, after the run-in and at the end of the study, insulin resistance was assessed by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index, while respiratory quotient (Rq) was evaluated by indirect calorimetry. Statins versus placebo significantly lowered plasma total, LDL-, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations and improved insulin resistance and Rq and metabolic control. Atorvastatin had a greater effect than simvastatin on plasma triglyceride concentration (-26.3+/-3.1 vs. -19.7+/-2.8%, P<0.03), HOMA index (-13.1+/-0.6 vs. -9.1+/-0.9%, P<0.05), Rq (5.9+/-0.4 vs. 3.1+/-0.5%, P<0.05) and glycosylated haemoglobin (-11.2+/-0.3 vs. -7. 1+/-0.4%, P<0.05). In the whole group of subjects (n=195) and at the end of the study, changes in plasma triglyceride concentrations were significantly correlated with the change in the HOMA index (r=0.44, P<0.001) and age and BMI adjusted-Rq (r=-0.32, P<0.005). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that decline in plasma triglyceride concentration was a significant determinant for explaining the effect of statin on insulin resistance and Rq. In conclusion our study demonstrates that statin administration is useful for controlling dyslipidemia in NIDDM patients and for improving the metabolic control. With regard to this latter aim, atorvastatin seems to be more powerful than simvastatin."

Statins are the most potent agents for lowering circulating LDL particles. Accumulation of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins in both fasting and postprandial state is strongly associated with the formation of highly atherogenic small dense LDL. Although dose-dependent reductions in levels of atherogenic lipids are observed with all statin, strong statins such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and pitavastatin, can reduce the triglyceride and small dense LDL greater than other statins. Statin is one of the first-line drugs for management of hypertriglyceridemia with elevated LDL-cholesterol and/or non HDL-cholesterol.

This review presents data showing that high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol are important risk factors of CAD and suggests that combined lipid profiles of triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol provide more information about risk of CAD than total cholesterol alone. High triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol is the characteristic dyslipidaemia seen in subjects with insulin resistance, a basic abnormality in glucose- and insulin metabolism. Since insulin resistance and raised triglyceride and decreased HDL cholesterol can be identified in children of patients with NIDDM, essential hypertension, and CAD, we suggest that efforts to prevent CAD should include interventions against all these associated abnormalities in glucose-, insulin-, and lipid metabolism and not only high cholesterol."

Our aim was to assess the prevalence of coronary stenoses (CS) in patients with type 2 diabetes and no history or symptom of cardiovascular disease and to investigate the association between TyG index and cardiovascular risk factors and both the presence and severity of CS.

We used the emerging NMR-based lipidomic technology to investigate compositional features of the HDLs of healthy individuals with normal coronary arteries, drug-naïve; recently diagnosed T2DM patients with normal coronary arteries; and patients with recent acute coronary syndrome. Patients with T2DM and normal serum lipid profiles even at diagnosis presented significant lipid alterations in HDL, characterized by higher triglycerides, lysophosphatidylcholine and saturated fatty acids; and lower cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, plasmalogens and polyunsaturated fatty acids, an atherogenic pattern that may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. These changes are qualitatively similar to those found, more profoundly, in normolipidemic patients with established Coronary Heart Disease (CHD).

Thus, we hypothesised that the re-balancing of cell redox levels and amelioration of liver function could result in a better glucose and lipid metabolism. To study this, we assessed the effect of a new oral formulation of an antioxidant agent - silybin-beta-cyclodextrin (named IBI/S) - in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease and concomitant T2DM.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Sixty outpatients were enrolled in a three-centre, double blind, randomised, IBI/S vs placebo study.

The efficacy parameters included fasting and mean daily plasma glucose levels, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), basal, stimulated C-peptide and insulin levels, total-, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels in addition to conventional liver function tests.

The same trend was observed in mean daily blood glucose levels, HbA1c and HOMA-IR, although differences were not significant. Basal and stimulated C-peptide values showed that only a few changes had occured in both groups. Such results indicate that insulin secretion was virtually unaffected, as confirmed also by the insulinemia data. Plasma triglycerides concentrations dropped from a baseline value of 186 mg/dl to 111 mg/dl (T6) in the IBI/S group, with significant differences at all instances with respect to baseline values. By contrast, triglycerides increased from 159 mg/dl at entry to 185 mg/dl (T6) in the placebo group. The difference between the groups at T6 was highly significant (p < 0.01). Total and HDL cholesterol as well as liver function tests did not change significantly during the study in both groups. MDA decreased significantly only in the group receiving IBI/S.

Both T-C and LDL-C elevated more (0.14 vs. -0.21, p = 0.008; 0.31 vs. 0.07, p = 0.015) and TAG and ox-LDL reduced less (-0.33 vs. 0.20, p = 0.033; -3.33 vs. -0.68, p = 0.026) in unaltered weight group compared to weight loss group. The women who gained weight developed higher TAG and ox-LDL/HDL-C ratio as compared to those who lost weight.

Gender-based differences include age at onset of CHD, typical presentation of CHD symptoms, relative importance of coronary risk factors, and the potential relationship of ovarian function and estrogen status to the development of CHD. The American Heart Association reported in 1998 that the leading cause of death for American women is cardiovascular disease, with CHD responsible for the majority of total deaths.

Apolipoprotein C-III (ApoC-III) modulates triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism through inhibition of lipoprotein lipase and hepatic uptake of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Mutations causing loss-of-function of ApoC-III lower triglycerides and reduce coronary heart disease risk, suggestive of a causal role for ApoC-III. Little data exist about the relationship of ApoC-III, triglycerides, and atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we examined the relationships between plasma ApoC-III, triglycerides, and coronary artery calcification in patients with T2DM.\n    \n\n\n          Approach and results:\n        \n      \n      Plasma ApoC-III levels were measured in a cross-sectional study of 1422 subjects with T2DM but without clinically manifest coronary heart disease. ApoC-III levels were positively associated with total cholesterol (Spearman r=0.36), triglycerides (r=0.59), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=0.16), fasting glucose (r=0.16), and glycosylated hemoglobin (r=0.12; P<0.0001 for all). In age, sex, and race-adjusted analysis, ApoC-III levels were positively associated with coronary artery calcification (Tobit regression ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-2.50 per SD increase in ApoC-III; P<0.001). As expected for an intermediate mediator, these findings were attenuated when adjusted for both triglycerides (Tobit regression ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.94-2.18; P=0.086) and separately for very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Tobit regression ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.71; P=0.53).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In persons with T2DM, increased plasma ApoC-III is associated with higher triglycerides, less favorable cardiometabolic phenotypes, and higher coronary artery calcification, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. Therapeutic inhibition of ApoC-III may thus be a novel strategy for reducing plasma triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and cardiovascular risk in T2DM."

            "abstract": "The major risk factors for coronary disease are blood pressure, blood lipids and cigarette smoking. Major advances have been made over the past 20 years in altering these factors and this has been accompanied by a dramatic reduction in new incidence myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke. Several questions remain however, concerning the best treatment approaches for 'mild' hypertension (DBP = 90-104 mmHg). One major question is the potential ability of different classes of antihypertensive drugs to prevent fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease. Underscoring this question is the recognition that drug classes differ in their lipid effects. Thiazide diuretics tend to increase total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, increase triglycerides and slightly lower high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. On the other hand alpha 1-antagonists have been shown to influence lipids favourably by lowering total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and increasing HDL-cholesterol. Other agents such as calcium channel blockers and ACE inhibitors appear to be lipid neutral. The cost effectiveness of various treatments for hypertension depends not only on direct drug costs but also on the less well-defined indirect costs associated with possible differences in disease rates between treatments. Estimates of disease occurrence with various lipid changes can be modelled after the results of the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT) and cost estimates of various diseases (i.e. acute MI) can be estimated from diagnosis-related group data, insurance data and physician survey data.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The results showed that 35% of the immigrants had high levels of total cholesterol (> or = 5.16 mmol/L) and 51% had high concentrations of LDL-Cholesterol (> or = 2.84 mmol/L). Moreover, 36% of them had high levels of triglycerides (> 1.69 mmol/L) and only the 15% had low concentrations of HDL-cholesterol (< or = 0.90 mmol/L). The ratio of men with high levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and low levels of HDL-cholesterol was larger that the one in women; although this difference was not significant. 41% of the studied population presented Castelli's Indexes (TC/HDL-C) above 4.5. In general, around 80% of the Chinese immigrants consume vegetables 5-6 times/week and 50% consume fruits with the same frequency. A high percentage of the immigrants eat food with animal protein more than 3 times/week and around 23% eat frequently snacks and fast foods. Our data suggest that the Chinese immigrants still keep some characteristics of their nutritional culture. Nevertheless, they have changed their food pattern to a more atherogenic one. It's important that nutritionists and other health professionals evaluate in detail the factors associated with the change in the food pattern of the immigrants, in order to avoid an increase in the rates of morbi-mortality of coronary disease in this group of population."

            "abstract": "Treatment of hyperlipidemic patients with the thiol compound N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was previously shown to cause a significant dose-related increase in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol serum level, suggesting the possibility that its disease-related decrease may result from a diminished thiol concentration and/or thiol/disulfide redox status (REDST) in the plasma. We therefore investigated plasma thiol levels and REDST in normo-/hyperlipidemic subjects with and without coronary heart disease (CHD). The thiol level, REDST, and amino acid concentrations in the plasma and intracellular REDST of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have been determined in 62 normo- and hyperlipidemic subjects. Thirty-three of these subjects underwent coronary angiography, because of clinical symptoms of CHD. All groups of hyperlipidemic patients under test and those normolipidemic individuals with documented coronary stenoses showed a marked decrease in plasma thiol concentrations, plasma and intracellular REDST of PBMCs, and a marked increase in plasma taurine levels. Individual plasma thiol concentrations and plasma REDST were strongly negatively correlated with the serum LDL-cholesterol and positively correlated with the serum HDL-cholesterol level. Together with the earlier report about the effect of NAC on the HDL-cholesterol serum level, our findings suggest strongly that lower HDL-cholesterol serum levels may result from a decrease in plasma thiol level and/or REDST possibly through an excessive cysteine catabolism into taurine."

The importance of abnormalities in lipoprotein metabolism as determinant of vascular risk in general population is similar in diabetes, where there is chronic hyperglycemia associated, but it is considered as an independent vascular risk factor. People with IDDM in adequate glycemic control generally have plasma lipid concentrations in normal levels, but in NIDDM, even in good glycemic control, there are another factors associated and usually there are hypertriglyceridemia and total hypercholesterolemia with reduced HDL fraction. Carbohydrate-rich diet increase plasma triglyceride levels and low HDL-cholesterol levels in the majority of studies. Substitute monounsaturated fats in the diet to replace saturated fats lowers total cholesterol and LDL fraction and increase HDL, in addition it acts over others vascular risk factors.

Because fish oil supplementation may favorably affect lipid and lipoprotein concentrations in nondiabetic subjects, we determined the effect of fish oil concentrate on plasma lipids and lipoprotein composition in patients with NIDDM. Dietary-supplementation 1-mo periods of 4.0 and 7.5 g of omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil were compared with a placebo of 12 g safflower oil by use of a single-blind crossover design. Medications, including antidiabetic therapy, were continued through the study. Compared with safflower oil treatment, fish oil supplementation resulted in a significant reduction of total plasma triglycerides of 24% at the 4-g dose and a larger reduction of 39% at the 7.5-g dose. These decreases were due to similar reductions in VLDL triglycerides. LDL cholesterol levels were mildly elevated, but a larger 20% increase in LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentration was observed. During supplementation with the fish oil concentrate, the LDL cholesterol-to-apoB ratio was significantly reduced when compared with pretreatment values, but not when compared with safflower oil treatment. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and plasma apoA1 levels were not significantly changed during fish oil treatment. At the 7.5-g dose, fasting glucose and glycohemoglobin levels increased by 20 and 12%, respectively, but were unchanged at the lower level of supplementation.

Low S-HDL levels, known to exist in the metabolic syndrome, as well as high serum triglycerides may also have been the results of phosphate depletion. The hypothesis presents a new serious disturbance which accounts for the dyslipidaemia, hyperglycaemia and the hypertension in metabolic syndrome. The proposed causal relationship between low S-P and the clustering of risk factors is based on results from a cross-sectional study of obese patients, where low S-P was associated with high body mass index (BMI), high blood glucose (B-glu), high systolic blood pressure (SBP), high diastolic blood pressure (DBP), but low serum high density lipoprotein (S-HDL) and serum magnesium (S-Mg) levels.

Contributory factors, such as blood pressure (BP), duration and age at onset of diabetes, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and body mass index (BMI) also were evaluated. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We recruited 116 African-American subjects with NIDDM for this cross-sectional, descriptive, and analytical study. BP, BMI, 24-h urine albumin excretion, creatinine clearance, serum creatinine, lipids, and GHb levels were measured. Albumin excretion rate (AER) was calculated, and subjects were divided into three groups: no nephropathy (AER < 20 micrograms/min), incipient nephropathy (AER 20-200 micrograms/min), and overt nephropathy (AER > 200 micrograms/min). Frequency of hypertension and nephropathy was analyzed by chi 2 testing, group means were compared using analysis of variance, and linear correlations were performed between AER and other variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association of these variables while controlling for the effects of other variables. RESULTS--Increased AER was present in 50% of our subjects; 31% had incipient and 19% had overt nephropathy. Hypertension was present in 72.4%; nephropathy, particularly overt nephropathy, was significantly more prevalent in the hypertensive group. Mean BP and diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were higher in the groups with incipient and overt nephropathy, and systolic blood pressure (sBP) was increased in overt nephropathy. Men with either form of nephropathy had higher sBP, dBP, and mean BP, whereas only women with overt nephropathy had increased sBP and mean BP. Subjects with incipient or overt nephropathy had a longer duration of diabetes, and those with overt nephropathy had a younger age at onset of diabetes. By multiple regression analysis, AER correlated with younger age at diabetes onset, but not with diabetes duration. No correlation with age, lipid levels, or GHb was noted. BMI correlated with AER. CONCLUSIONS--Incipient and overt nephropathy were observed frequently in these African-American subjects with NIDDM. Albuminuria correlated with BP, younger age at diabetes onset, and BMI. Association of albuminuria and increased cardiovascular mortality may place 50% of inner-city African-American patients with NIDDM at risk for developing cardiovascular complications."

Eighteen autologous bone-marrow patients not requiring cyclosporin were used as a control group. Patients were studied 5 days prior to transplantation, and on days 30, 60, and 100 after transplantation.

Nutritional supplementation, conditioning regimens, and concomitant medications were not significantly different between groups. Furthermore, no significant differences in age, weight, lipid, or lipoprotein levels were found at baseline. Our results indicate that cyclosporin therapy induces a reversible increase of plasma cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and a decrease of HDL-cholesterol, HDL2-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I. The addition of prednisone to cyclosporin therapy induces a higher increase in plasma cholesterol mainly due to an increase in HDL-cholesterol. Total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio increased significantly in patients treated only with cyclosporin. No differences were found in this ratio in patients treated with prednisone compared to those submitted to autologous bone-marrow transplantation.

It can lead to mistyping of C as T alleles in C/T heterozygotes, resulting in overestimation of -514 T homozygotes.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The T allele of the hepatic lipase -514 C/T polymorphism is associated with changes in plasma lipids. The superficially paradoxical predisposition to CHD in males is attributable to impairment of TG rich lipoprotein metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport."

            "abstract": "A low plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and is often accompanied by increased triglyceride concentrations. Women have generally higher HDL-cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentrations and concomitantly are at lower risk of CHD than men. As HDL particle size is a new and potentially important marker of CHD risk, we have examined the potential gender difference in HDL particle size, assessed by nondenaturing 4-30% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, in a sample of men (n=231) and women (n=183). Overall, men were characterized by a less favorable lipoprotein--lipid profile, which was accompanied by smaller HDL particle size compared to women. However, when men and women were matched for HDL particle size and compared for their metabolic profile, it was found that both genders were characterized by similar plasma lipoprotein--lipid profile despite the fact that women were characterized by higher levels of total body fat but lower waist girth than men. In summary, HDL particle size is a strong marker of the gender-related difference in the determination of the metabolic risk profile."

NIDDM patients showed IMT values equivalent to those in normal adults > or = 20 years of age. Multiple regression analysis showed that IMT in IDDM patients was positively related to the duration of diabetes (P = 0.00061) as well as to age (P = 0.00046). No other possible risk factors, such as serum total cholesterol level, serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level, serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level, serum triglycerides, serum lipoprotein(a) level, or systolic or diastolic blood pressure, have shown significant correlations with IMT in IDDM patients. However, non-HDL-cholesterol, smoking, and systolic hypertension were independently responsible for increases in IMT values of NIDDM patients as well as age and duration of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) or a placebo was given for four weeks, during which blood glucose concentrations remained controlled. As compared with the placebo, lovastatin reduced total cholesterol by 26 percent, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 28 percent, and LDL apolipoprotein B by 26 percent. Lovastatin therapy also reduced plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 31 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Although there was no change in the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol fell by 29 percent. No side effects or abnormalities in serum values were noted during short-term lovastatin therapy. The beneficial effects of lovastatin on plasma lipid levels in patients with NIDDM could decrease the risk of the development of coronary heart disease."

Fifty-two men and 69 women randomly selected from three rural communities and a low socioeconomic urban community in the Eastern Highlands Province were assessed for hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, diastolic hypertension and cigarette smoking. There was no significant difference between the findings in the rural and urban groups. The mean fasting levels of serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and apoproteins A-I and B were significantly lower (p less than 0.001) than those of rural Australians in a comparative study but the serum triglyceride levels were significantly higher in men less than 30 yr and women less than 40 yr of age. There was no significant difference in the serum cholesterol levels in men and women, and the levels of serum cholesterol and triglyceride did not rise with age. The mean fasting levels of plasma glucose were generally lower in PNG subjects and only two (1.7%) had diabetes mellitus. The proportions of highlanders who had diastolic hypertension or who smoked cigarettes were similar to those of Australian populations generally. The low incidence of CHD in PNG highlanders is probably related to the low serum cholesterol and apoprotein B levels, in turn probably related to their basically vegetarian diet and physically active life-style."

Both in the normolipidemics and in the combined group HDL3-cholesterol (HDL3-chol) as well as HDL2-cholesterol (HDL2-chol) showed a parabolic relationship with total HDL-chol. The results indicate, that at low total HDL-chol values almost all cholesterol is present in the HDL3 fraction, which shows a linear increase with total HDL-chol from 0 to 0.75 mmol/l. At a further increase of total HDL-chol, cholesterol is increasingly isolated in the HDL2-fraction, especially when HDL3-chol has reached its maximum (about 1.25 mmol/l). Thus, the magnitude of the absolute intra-individual variation of either HDL3-chol or HDL2-chol (in mmol/l) is related to the total HDL-chol concentration. Given the strong correlation between cholesterol in both HDL-subfractions with total HDL-chol and the inverse relationship of total HDL-chol with the risk for coronary heart disease, a rise in HDL3-chol or in HDL2-chol may be equally favorable."

Despite differences of opinion, present data allow a certain number of conclusions to be drawn. Hyperchylomicronemia is not associated with atherosclerosis, whereas type III hyperlipidemia is very atherogenic. These two abnormalities are, however, rare, and the majority of hypertriglyceridemias are, in practice, associated with increased very low density lipoproteins. Many epidemiological trials do not identify hypertriglyceridemia as an independent risk factor when the cholesterol and, in particular, the HDL cholesterol levels, are taken into consideration. Nevertheless, these results must be interpreted with caution as hypertriglyceridemia represents a very heterogeneous entity which is closely related to many factors which affect coronary risk (hypertension, insulin resistance, sedentarity, and even tobacco consumption). Therefore, hypertriglyceridemia and hypo-HDL-emia may be the result of the same primary abnormality; as the HDL-cholesterol level is more stable, it is the parameter which will be identified as a protective factor in epidemiological trials. The available data is insufficient to affirm that therapeutic lowering of triglycerides is accompanied by a reduced coronary risk because none of the large scale trials were designed to analyse this problem. Despite these epidemiological data, the measurement of serum triglyceride levels remains important in patients with hyperlipidemia."

The present study was designed as a risk factor analysis of BPH in which the estimated annual BPH growth rate was related to components of the metabolic syndrome. Two hundred and fifty patients referred to the Urological Section, Department of Surgery, Central Hospital, Varberg, Sweden, with lower urinary tract symptoms with or without manifestations of the metabolic syndrome were consecutively included. The prevalences of atherosclerotic disease manifestations, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and treated hypertension were obtained. Data on blood pressure, waist and hip measurement, body height and weight were collected and body mass index (BMI) and waist/hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Blood samples were drawn from fasting patients to determine insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol, uric acid, alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The prostate gland volume was determined using ultrasound. The median annual BPH growth rate was 1.04 ml/year. Men with fast-growing BPH had a higher prevalence of NIDDM (p = 0.023) and treated hypertension (p = 0.049). These patients were also taller (p=0.004) and more obese as measured by body weight (p<0.001), BMI (p=0.026), waist measurement (p <0.001), hip measurement (p = 0.006) and WHR (p=0.029). Moreover, they had elevated fasting plasma insulin levels (p = 0.018) and lower HDL cholesterol levels (p = 0.021) than men with slow-growing BPH. The annual BPH growth rate correlated positively with diastolic blood pressure (rs = 0.14; p = 0.009), BMI (rs = 0.24; p < 0.001) and four other expressions of obesity and fasting plasma insulin level (rs = 0.18; p = 0.008), and negatively with the HDL cholesterol level (rs = -0.22; p = 0.001). In conclusion, the data suggest that NIDDM, hypertension, tallness, obesity, high insulin and low HDL cholesterol levels constitute risk factors for the development of BPH. The results also suggest that BPH is a component of the metabolic syndrome and that BPH patients may share the same metabolic abnormality of a defective insulin-mediated glucose uptake and secondary hyperinsulinaemia, as patients with the metabolic syndrome. The findings support the hypothesis of a causal relationship between high insulin levels and the development of BPH, and give rise to a hypothesis of increased sympathetic nerve activity in men with BPH."

            "abstract": "Since the first interventional studies on cholesterol, many large prospective trials have demonstrated that the statins can reduce the risk of a major cardiovascular event by 25 to 35%. But, in spite of the overall decrease in LDL-cholesterol in the general population over the last 20 years and treatments with statins, the persistence of a high residual vascular risk is observed in some patients. This residual risk is observed mainly in patients with atherogenic dyslipidaemia with low HDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and a preponderance of small and dense LDL-cholesterol particles, a profile frequently found in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity or metabolic syndrome and which has been called the \"lipid triad\". The frank increase in the prevalence of these metabolic abnormalities in populations worldwide casts doubt on the benefits acquired over the last few years in cardiovascular prevention. Not only does it appear essential to improve the treatment of all risk factors (hypertension, smoking, etc.), but it now seems necessary to manage all lipid parameters by decreasing LDL and also triglycerides and by increasing HDL. The development of new pathways of research and the introduction of novel compounds, which have demonstrated their clinical effectiveness, with regard to HDL in particular, are awaited."

Eighty-two patients, with a diastolic pressure of 100 mm Hg or more, were identified after screening 6000 men. Many patients were overweight. 82 population controls, matched by sex, age and body mass index, were also recruited. Fourty-eight per cent of the patients and 25% of the controls had a family history of hypertension. Serum triglyceride and urate values were higher in patients than controls at the baseline investigation. Seventy-four patients were followed for 1 year. The dose of pindolol averaged 7.7 mg once daily after 1 year. The diastolic blood pressure was reduced by 13.4 mm Hg. The target pressure of 95 mm Hg or less was achieved in 89% of the patients. The HDL-cholesterol concentration was normal and did not change, whereas the LDL-cholesterol concentration decreased by 0.15 mmol.l-1 during treatment. The total triglyceride values increased transiently up to 6 months, but no significant increase was seen after one year. It is concluded that pindolol had no adverse effect on serum cholesterol and its HDL- and LDL-fractions during 1 year of treatment."

            "abstract": "Afro-Caribbean men in the United Kingdom have a favorable lipoprotein profile and are at low risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with Europeans and South Asians, but are at high risk of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) compared with Europeans. To investigate these differences, a cross-sectional comparison was undertaken for measures of lipoprotein metabolism, body composition, and insulin's glucoregulatory and antilipolytic actions in 92 healthy men (42 to 61 years) of Afro-Caribbean, South Asian, or European origin. Afro-Caribbean men were more insulin-resistant than Europeans (insulin sensitivity [Si], 1.96 v3.01 min(-1) x microU(-1) x mL, P < .01). They nevertheless had a more favorable lipoprotein profile, with lower levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (0.21 v 0.40 mmol/L, P < .01) and triglycerides (0.34 v 0.74 mmol/L, P < .01), lower serum total triglycerides, higher high-density lipoprotein 2 (HDL2) cholesterol, and larger low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size. These differences were not accounted for by differences in nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, the sensitivity of suppression of NEFA levels to insulin, or body composition. South Asians were also more insulin-resistant than Europeans but had a less favorable lipoprotein profile. Afro-Caribbean men in the United Kingdom are as insulin-resistant as South Asian men but less susceptible to the lipid disturbances that characteristically accompany insulin resistance. This favorable lipid pattern may relate to more effective VLDL metabolism rather than a reduced supply of NEFA as substrate for triglyceride synthesis."

Diabetic men and women were strictly comparable as far as age, relative body weight and metabolic control were concerned. In women, total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein A correlated positively with HbA1 but not with fasting and mean plasma glucose. In men, no correlation between metabolic control and lipid and apolipoprotein levels was found.

We therefore studied the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation by phenylhydrazine (LDL-PO) in NIDDM patients with or without macroangiopathy, and in controls. Results showed that the LDL of patients with macroangiopathy (n = 50) were more susceptible to oxidation than those of both NIDDM patients without vascular complications (n = 50) and controls (n = 50). In diabetic patients, there was a positive correlation between LDL-PO and the following parameters: total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B. In contrast, there was no correlation between LDL-PO and the parameters of glycemic control (fasting glucose, HbAlc). After analyzing the composition of LDL, it appeared that LDL-PO values in diabetic patients were positively correlated with those of all LDL constituents. The increase in LDL-PO observed in the group of NIDDM patients with macroangiopathy could be a consequence of an increase in the LDL triglyceride content in these patients."

Apolipoprotein C-III (apo C-III) plays a regulatory role in the catabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins. The S2 allele has been associated with elevated plasma triglycerides concentration, blood pressure and increased risk of myocardial infarction, all of which are characteristic of an insulin resistant state. The aim of this study was to investigate the SstI polymorphism of the apo C-III gene locus on the lipoprotein metabolism, apolipoproteins and basal glucose and insulin levels in essential hypertensive patients.

The frequency for the carriers of the SstI minor allele S2 (S1S2 genotype) was 0.17.

Several risk factors--dyslipidemia induced by NIDDM, obesity, hypertension and hyperglycemia--likely contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis. The dyslipidemia in NIDDM is characterized by abnormalities in composition and metabolism of very low density lipoproteins, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). However, because of the lack of long-term prospective epidemiologic studies, the relative importance of lipoprotein risk factors in the causation of CAD in diabetic patients is not clear. The World Health Organization Multinational Study of vascular disease in diabetics observed increased prevalence of CAD in diabetic populations with relatively high levels of plasma cholesterol and supports the concept that lowering cholesterol levels may significantly reduce coronary risk in NIDDM. To determine the effectiveness of lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, for lowering cholesterol levels, 16 patients with NIDDM and mild to moderate increases in plasma cholesterol were given lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner for 4 weeks. Compared with the placebo, lovastatin reduced concentrations of total cholesterol (233 +/- 10 vs 172 +/- 7 mg/dl [standard error of the mean], p less than 0.001), LDL cholesterol (140 +/- 9 vs 101 +/- 6 mg/dl, p less than 0.001), and LDL apolipoprotein-B (108 +/- 16 vs 80 +/- 16 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). Plasma triglycerides and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels also decreased by 31 and 42%, respectively. Although HDL cholesterol levels did not increase, the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio decreased significantly with lovastatin therapy.

            "abstract": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is preceded by impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) lasting for years before manifesting as overt hyperglycaemia. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of IGT and NIDDM. Obesity, physical inactivity and high-fat diet have been found to predict IGT and NIDDM. Therefore, a diet and exercise intervention from diagnosis of NIDDM could improve the treatment outcome and prognosis of patients with NIDDM. Furthermore, because subjects with IGT are at increased risk for diabetes and atherosclerotic vascular disease, it is reasonable to assume that in terms of reducing the incidence and longterm consequences of NIDDM an intervention at this phase is more effective than in overt diabetes. Although the nonpharmacological approach is generally accepted as the first-line treatment of NIDDM its efficacy has often been questioned. Therefore, it is important to carry out long-term controlled studies to find out to what extent lifestyle modification could improve the metabolic control and level of major cardiovascular risk factors known to be associated with poor outcome in NIDDM. This kind of study also gave relevant experience in planning studies aiming at primary prevention of NIDDM. One-year dietary and exercise intervention on newly diagnosed NIDDM patients in Kuopio, Finland resulted in a better metabolic control and a moderate reduction in cardiovascular risk factors as compared to the conventional treatment group. After the second year of follow-up only 12.5% in the intervention group were receiving oral antidiabetic drugs vs. 34.8% in the conventional treatment group. Weight reduction and a reduced use of saturated fats appeared to be the main determinants of successful treatment results. Good aerobic capacity was associated with an increase in HDL cholesterol. A multicentre primary prevention study on IGT patients is continuing in Finland applying the same principles of intervention as used in the study on newly diagnosed NIDDM patients. Pilot results show that glucose tolerance can be improved by lifestyle changes."

In the present study the lipid and apolipoprotein profiles have been compared in type II diabetic subjects with (n = 30) and without (n = 30) coronary heart disease (CHD). All subjects were studied after good metabolic control had been achieved. Significant differences in plasma lipids and apolipoproteins were seen in diabetic patients with CHD in comparison with diabetics without CHD. Patients with CHD presented higher total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, apo B, apo CII and apo CIII levels and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol HDL-cholesterol ratios and lower HDL-cholesterol values and apo A1/apo B ratio than the patients without CHD. The same findings were found in females; while male subjects with CHD had significantly increased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apo B levels and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratios and significantly decreased apo A1/apo B ratio compared with males without CHD. These findings support the concept that the apolipoprotein profile plays a remarkable role as risk factor for CHD in type II diabetes mellitus."

In 34% of the patients symptoms of the ischaemic heart disease were present. In these cases the ischaemic heart disease prevailing rates for the HLP-types IIa and IIb were higher for the male sex, in the HLP-types III-V, on the other hand, higher for the female sex. With the appearance of the hypertriglyceridaemia, independent on the HLP-type, an increasing reversion of the sex ratio became evident. The total cholesterol level scarcely allowed evidence on the coronary risk in HLP-patients. The importance of the HDL-cholesterol as indicator of risk must be regarded in connection with the actual triglyceride values as well as with sex. Thus the general validity of the HDL-cholesterol was relative."

Eight patients with Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, NIDDM) were studied (age: 61.5 +/- 2.8 years; diabetes duration: 10.2 +/- 1.6 years). They were additionally given troglitazone (200 mg once daily) since their fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c levels had been increased in spite of conventional medications. Before and after 12 weeks of treatment with troglitazone their blood pressure, FPG, HbA1c, lipid profiles and NOx were measured. Troglitazone treatment had a slight depressor effect (decreasing the blood pressure from 133 +/- 5/72 +/- 3 to 127 +/- 4/68 +/- 1 mmHg; p < 0.05). FPG and HbA1c were significantly decreased with the therapy (181 +/- 10 to 160 +/- 10 mg/dl; p < 0.05 and 9.1 +/- 0.6 to 8.1 +/- 0.5%; p < 0.05, respectively). In contrast, total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and LDL-C were maintained within normal limits throughout the study. Although lysoPC and NOx levels were not altered, a negative correlation between lysoPC and NOx levels was observed. These results suggest that troglitazone is a beneficial agent improving FPG and HbA1c levels in NIDDM patients, while its effects on serum lysoPC and NOx levels, at least for 12 weeks, seem to be minimal."

In this study the interrelations between microalbuminuria and metabolic control, lipoprotein(a), other blood lipids and several haemostasis parameters were studied in 96 NIDDM patients (50 women, 46 men). Forty-three patients showed microalbuminuria.

It is therefore likely that therapy for hypertension associated with NIDDM may further influence an existing atherogenic lipid profile.

Changes in CHD risk factors were examined at 6 month intervals in 159 moderately overweight subjects who were participating in an 18 month behavioral weight loss program. Men experienced greater decreases in blood pressure, triglycerides, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and greater increases in HDL-cholesterol with weight loss than women. Most of these gender differences were removed by adjusting for baseline values and changes in BMI. After these adjustments, improvements in WHR at 18 months were shown to be greater in women than in men. Participants (n = 39) who lost 4.5 kg or more from baseline to 6 months (mean weight loss of 11.8 kg or 13% of initial body weight) and maintained this weight loss within +/- 2.3 kg had significant long term improvements (through 18 months) in triglycerides, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, WHR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and fasting and 2 h insulin. Changes in HDL-cholesterol, the HDL:Total cholesterol ratio, and WHR actually increased between 6 and 18 months and improvements in all other parameters were maintained over time. Men have greater improvements in CHD risk factors with weight loss than women, but this gender difference appears to derive from differences in CHD risk factors at baseline and differences in weight loss.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

For HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol as well as LDL significant differences of the mean value were the result in the group of juvenile patients with a coronary heart disease and in the healthy control group as well as the group of older test persons with infarction, which confirm the accumulation of lipid-chemical risk constellations in \"juvenile\" patient with a coronary heart disease. Moreover, the proportion of primary hyperlipoproteinaemias is essentially greater in these patients than in older test persons with infarction. Apart from the recognition of primary hypercholesterolaemias the diagnostics of autosomally combined hyperlipoproteinaemias is of particular importance."

Serum lipoproteins, plasma glucose, haemostatic factors and other putative risk characteristics were measured in 75 Indian, 64 European and 24 West Indian men aged 45-54 years. These represented 81% of men registered with a general practice and resident within a defined area. In 51 men, diet was assessed by 5-day weighed inventory. Plasma phospholipid fatty acids (PFA) were measured in 18 Indians and 19 Europeans with dietary records. The relatively high HDL and HDL2-cholesterol concentrations, low LDL-cholesterol concentration, reduced fat intake, increased ratio of dietary polyunsaturated/saturated fat, relatively frequent use of alcohol, and lack of obesity in West Indians accorded with their low SMR from CHD. By contrast, only the relatively low HDL and HDL2-cholesterol concentrations, infrequency of alcohol consumption, and lower proportion of PFA as n-3 fatty acids of marine origin afforded explanations for the high SMR of Indians. Hyperglycaemia appeared similarly prevalent in Indians and West Indians, but less common in Europeans. Of the haemostatic factors, West Indians had a relatively low VIIc (not statistically significant), while Indians had an increased platelet count and reduced platelet volume. Improved understanding of these ethnic differences in CHD mortality may depend upon elucidation of the contrasts in HDL-cholesterol concentration."

Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels in microvascular angina patients (235 +/- 46 mg dL-1, 135 +/- 33 mg dL-1 and 146 +/- 32 mg dL-1 respectively) were significantly higher than in control subjects (204 +/- 40 mg dL-1, 116 +/- 35 mg dL-1 and 129 +/- 29 mg dL-1 respectively, P < 0.01). These parameters were also significantly higher in CAD patients than in control subjects. By contrast, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels in microvascular angina patients were no different from those in control subjects, although both were significantly higher than in the CAD patients (48 +/- 16 mg dL-1 and 45 +/- 12 mg dL-1 compared with 40 +/- 10 mg dL-1, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively). Similar results were obtained for the apolipoprotein AI levels. Furthermore, the atherogenic risk ratio, LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol, in microvascular angina patients was significantly lower than in the CAD patients (3.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.5 respectively, P < 0.01). Median (range) serum lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels in microvascular angina patients and CAD patients [13 mg dL-1 (0.8-92) and 16 mg dL-1 (0.8-96) respectively] were significantly higher than in control subjects [7 mg-dL-1 (0.8-44)], P < 0.01 and P < 0.005 respectively. Sigmoidal curves and electrophoretic mobility of the Cu(2+)-oxidized LDL in both microvascular angina and CAD patients were not significantly different from those of control subjects. Finally, no significant differences were found between groups in total triglyceride levels or in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL and HDL triglyceride levels. Our results show that the microvascular angina patients exhibit lipid abnormalities similar to those observed in CAD patients, with the important exception of the HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI levels, which are significantly higher in microvascular angina patients. We suggest that the abnormal cholesterol and Lp(a) levels may be involved in the pathophysiology of microvascular angina by affecting endothelial function and endothelium-mediated vasodilator responses, whereas the higher HDL levels may be a factor contributing to the absence of angiographically documented CAD in microvascular angina patients."

This study attempts to estimate the prevalence of CHD and HTN and to assess the related risks among the newly diagnosed diabetics in the developing communities. From a total of 3583 non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) subjects, the authors investigated 693 (M = 295, F = 398) randomly selected non-smokers of age 30-60 years. WHO diagnostic criteria were used for NIDDM and IGT. Systolic and diastolic hypertension (sHTN and dHTN) were defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or = 140 and diastolic (DBP) > or = 90 mmHg. Diagnosis of CHD was based on electrocardiogram either on rest or on stress or both when equivocal. The overall prevalence of CHD in the NIDDM subjects was 18.6%. The prevalence rates of sHTN and dHTN were 23.2 and 13.6%, respectively. CHD and HTN did not differ significantly between male and female and between urban and rural subjects. CHD prevalence was significantly higher in the higher tertiles of age, SBP and DBP (P < 0.001, for all cases). Logistic regression showed that only the increasing age, high waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and high BP were the independent risks for CHD. For sHTN, the independent risks were increased age and high body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2). Regardless of sex and area, increased prevalence of CHD and HTN were found in the newly diagnosed diabetic subjects. Increased age, central obesity and HTN were the independent risks for CHD while advancing age and overall obesity was related to sHTN."

Patients with angiographically defined coronary artery disease had significantly lower plasma levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, apolipoproteins A-I and A-II, and significantly higher values of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B than those in patients without coronary artery disease. The ratios derived from the measurements as LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol, apo B/apo A-I and apo B/apo A-II were highly significantly increased in the patients with coronary artery disease. Coronary score values, by which the severity of coronary artery disease was quantified, were not related to plasma levels of the HDL components, while they were positively correlated with those of the LDL components. These results suggest that, in single measurements, plasma levels of the HDL components, HDL-cholesterol and apo A-I, contribute strongly to the discrimination between patients with coronary artery disease and those without this disease, whereas the LDL components, LDL-cholesterol and apo B are more suitable parameters for the severity of the disease than are the HDL components.

            "abstract": "It has been suggested that the lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease in women before menopause in comparison with men may be explained by differences in body fat distribution, plasma lipoprotein levels and indices of plasma glucose-insulin homeostasis. Thus, gender differences in visceral adipose tissue accumulation measured by computed tomography and metabolic variables were studied in 80 men and 69 pre-menopausal women, aged 23-50 years. Despite the fact that women had higher levels of total body fat (p < 0.0001), they displayed lower areas of abdominal visceral adipose tissue (p < 0.06) and a lower ratio of abdominal visceral to mid-thigh adipose tissue areas than men (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for body fat mass, women generally displayed a more favourable risk profile than men which included higher plasma HDL2-cholesterol and lower plasma insulin, apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels (p < 0.01). Metabolic variables adjusted for body fat mass were then compared between genders after control for differences in abdominal visceral adipose tissue area. After such controls, variables related to plasma glucose-insulin homeostasis were no longer significantly different between men and women. Gender differences for plasma concentrations of triglyceride, apolipoprotein B and the ratio of HDL2-cholesterol/HDL3-cholesterol also disappeared, whereas plasma concentrations of HDL-cholesterol, HDL2-cholesterol as well as the ratio of HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol remained significantly higher in women than in men (p < 0.01). These results suggest that abdominal visceral adipose tissue is an important correlate of gender differences in cardiovascular disease risk. However, additional factors are likely to be involved in gender differences in plasma HDL-cholesterol levels."

One means is hormone replacement therapy. Estrogens lower LDL-cholesterol by up to 20% and increase HDL-cholesterol up to 30%. This effect remains even after addition of a suitable progestin. Numerous large scale studies indicate that every other cardiovascular death can be prohibited by the simple measure of hormone replacement therapy.

Project B is a prospective cohort study, which was started in 1982 by a baseline investigation, including approximately 6000 men aged 40 to 60 years. Follow-up investigations were performed in 1985 and 1987 in order to record reasons of death and incidences of newly developed diseases. Further follow-up investigations are planned for 1990 and 1992. Until now incidence data of death and diseases are available for a 5-year observation period (January 1982-December 1986), and for more than 95% of the original study participants. The results clearly indicate that plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol, followed by plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and apoprotein B are the predominant predictors for the risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD; i.e. fatal and non fatal myocardial infarction as well as sudden coronary death and chronic coronary heart disease). Further significantly positive associations to the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) were found for the following parameters: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, family history of premature MI, cigarette smoking, plasma levels of triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol and blood glucose. Plasma concentrations of HDL-cholesterol and apo A1 showed an inverse relationship to the MI incidence and--somewhat weaker--the same was true for the frequency of alcohol consumption and of physical leisure activity. Besides LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and apoprotein B the following parameters showed significantly positive associations to the risk of chronic coronary heart disease: Systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure and--to a lesser extent--the plasma levels of triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol and blood glucose. An inverse relationship to the incidence rate of chronic coronary heart disease was found for HDL-cholesterol, apo A1 and the frequency of physical leisure activity. Based on the epidemiological results from GRIPS, additionally considering results from other epidemiologic studies and pathophysiological findings a diagnostic strategy was developed for the early recognition of patients at increased coronary risk. LDL-cholesterol is the most important variable in this diagnostic schedule but the coronary status and the individual profile of further risk factors (i.e. positive family history of premature myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, increased plasma levels of triglyceride rich lipoproteins or Lp(a) as well as decreased plasma concentrations of HDL-cholesterol or apo A1) are additionally taken into account."

At week 0, 24 patients (48%) were characterized by small dense LDL phenotype pattern B. After the treatment period a shift towards normal LDL particle size was observed in 17 patients but seven patients (29%) showed the more atherogenic LDL subclass pattern B. After treatment, plasma HDL-cholesterol was significantly lower (P<0.05) in these patients compared to those who had LDL subclass pattern A. Multivariate regression analysis revealed VLDL-cholesterol or triglycerides and HDL(3)-cholesterol as independent determinants for LDL particle size. Change in HDL(2)-cholesterol was an independent determinant for change in LDL particle size. In conclusion, a strategy of intensive lipid-lowering, with the intention to reduce triglyceride levels below 1.7 mmol/l, may be insufficient to ensure improvement in LDL size in all patients."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of atorvastatin in a cohort of type 2 diabetics.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      Participants were divided into 3 groups on the basis of whether they had evidence of myocardial infarction or coronary lesions (group A), a family history of hypercholesterolemia (and/or cardiovascular diseases) and total cholesterol levels constantly above 270 mg/dL in blood samples taken at regular 4-month intervals and previously never at target level (group B), or clinical and/or instrumental (electrocardiogram) evidence of cardiovascular risk (group C). Their mean age was 64 +/- 7 years, known disease duration 0.5 +/- 3 years, body mass index (BMI) 27.7 +/- 1.3 Kg/m2, and haemoglobin A1c 8 +/- 0.6%. Total cholesterol was 256 +/- 24 mg/dL in group A, 298 +/- 25 mg/dL in group B and 244 +/- 31 mg/dL in group C (p < 0.05: group B vs groups A and C). HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was 45 +/- 7 mg/dL, triglycerides 225 +/- 20 mg/dL, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) respectively 144 +/- 7 and 85 +/- 8 mmHg, fibrinogen 330 +/- 23 mg/dL and microalbuminuria 58 +/- 9 mg/L. Eighteen months' atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/day in 106 subjects, 20 mg in 14 subjects, 30 mg in 5 subjects, and 40 mg in 30 subjects) led to a significant decrease in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels (p < 0.01), with about 86% of the patients achieving target levels, and a significant (p < 0.05) increase in HDL-C. There was a significant decrease in fibrinogen, microalbuminuria and DBP (p < 0.01), without any change in diet, BMI, physical activity or antihypertensive treatment. No new cardiovascular events or hospital admissions due to cardiovascular diseases were recorded during the 18 months of the study.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These long-term treatment findings confirm and validate previous medium-term results, and suggest that atorvastatin therapy is effective and safe in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular complications in type 2 diabetes."

            "abstract": "Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed as well as developing countries like Bangladesh. There is a crucial need to identify additional risk factors that are easily measurable and treatable in general population. Role of serum lipids, lipoproteins and lipoprotein related variables in the prediction of stroke is less clear. Abnormalities in plasma lipoproteins are the most firmly established and best understood risk factors for atherosclerosis and they are probable risk factors for ischaemic stroke, largely by their link to atherosclerosis. High serum apolipoprotein-B (Apo-B) levels may predict an increased risk for ischaemic stroke. Aim of the study was to evaluate the association between serum Apo-B level and acute ischaemic stroke and to measure and compare serum Apo-B level in ischaemic stroke and normal subjects. A cross-sectional comparative study was carried out in the department of Neurology, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from July 2013 to June 2015. A total number of 100 subjects within 18-70 years were considered for the study. Fifty (50) subjects with stroke (both clinically as well as CT scan of head or MRI of brain proven) were taken as the cases and 50 age and sex matched nearly healthy individuals without stroke were taken as the controls by using non-probability sampling procedure. Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were estimated by enzymatic method using Semiautoanalyser. LDL cholesterol was estimated by Friedewald formula. Apo-B was estimated by immunoturbidimetric method using Semiautoanalyser. Finally collected data were analyzed by using SPSS software Version 20. Student 't' test was used to compare the data between cases and controls. P value was set <0.05. Diagnostic validity tests were conducted to assess the diagnostic efficiency of Apo-B. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are significantly increased in cases compared to controls. HDL-cholesterol was significantly decreased in cases compared to controls. Apo-B was significantly increased in cases compared to controls. The result was statistically significant. Apo-B may be used as predictors of ischaemic stroke components."

This report analyses the risk factors for subsequent coronary heart disease and all-cause death during the 11-year follow-up. The prognostic significance of the categories of the NIDDM Policy Group was validated with respect to the incidence of coronary heart disease and mortality. At baseline 1139 subjects, aged 30-55 years at the time of diabetes detection and classified as diet controlled after a 6-week screening phase, were included. Of the patients 112 (15.2%) suffered from myocardial infarction, 197 (19.82%) of 994 had died. The odds ratio for all-cause mortality compared to the general population for males at the age of 36-45 years was 5.1 and for females 7.0. In multivariate analysis age, blood pressure and smoking were independent risk factors for myocardial infarction and male sex, age, blood pressure, triglycerides, postprandial blood glucose and smoking for death, respectively. The categories of the NIDDM Policy Group target parameters for blood glucose, triglycerides and blood pressure were significant predictors of both CHD and death. Thus, it appears that in NIDDM good control of blood glucose, blood pressure and triglycerides is associated with a lower incidence of coronary heart disease and death rate respectively."

The patients were randomly assigned to receive first one diet and then the other, each for 28 days, in a metabolic ward. In the high-carbohydrate diet, 25 percent of the energy was in the form of fat and 60 percent in the form of carbohydrates (47 percent of the total energy was in the form of complex carbohydrates); the high-monounsaturated-fat diet was 50 percent fat (33 percent of the total energy in the form of monounsaturated fatty acids) and 35 percent carbohydrates. The two diets had the same amounts of simple carbohydrates and fiber. As compared with the high-carbohydrate diet, the high-monounsaturated-fat diet resulted in lower mean plasma glucose levels and reduced insulin requirements, lower levels of plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (lower by 25 and 35 percent, respectively; P less than 0.01), and higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (higher by 13 percent; P less than 0.005). Levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol did not differ significantly in patients on the two diets. These preliminary results suggest that partial replacement of complex carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids in the diets of patients with NIDDM does not increase the level of LDL cholesterol and may improve glycemic control and the levels of plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol."

FER(HDL) and LDL subfraction profile were also favorably affected. However, no effect on HDL subclasses was found. There were no statistically significant differences in lipid resistance to oxidation measured in serum and in LDL (lag time and Vmax) before and after therapy. No significant effect of ciprofibrate was found on oxidative DNA damage. The evaluation of the relationship between oxidative damage of purines with lag time in LDL and maximal rate of serum lipid oxidation showed significant correlations after therapy (r = -0.58; 0.47, p = 0.01; 0.05, respectively), but only trends before starting ciprofibrate treatment. Type 2 diabetes mellitus represents a complex metabolic disorder expressed in glucose and lipoprotein disturbances and increased oxidative stress. Ciprofibrate therapy favorably affected major features of lipid abnormalities of diabetic patients, but the level of oxidative stress assessed by in vitro and in vivo methods was not changed. The evaluation of expected logical correlations between the parameters of lipoprotein metabolism, lipid resistance in serum and LDL, and oxidative DNA damage showed that those correlations were more relevant and significant after ciprofibrate treatment and were not related with glucose homeostasis."

In addition to the qualitative changes, mtDNA is subject to quantitative changes, and is vulnerable to oxidative stress, resulting in both qualitative and quantitative changes. This study was performed to investigate whether quantitative changes in mtDNA occur in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients and also in pre-diabetic subjects. MtDNA content from peripheral blood was measured by slot-blot analysis in 55 NIDDM patients and 29 age- and sex-matched control subjects. We have also analysed the mtDNA copies by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in 23 pre-diabetic subjects who converted to diabetic in 2 years and 22 age- and sex-matched control subjects who remained non-diabetic. Mean mtDNA quantity measured by slot blot method was 35% lower in patients with NIDDM than in control subjects (12.3+/-8.1 vs. 19.1+/-8.2 AU/microg DNA; P < 0.05). MtDNA quantities did not correlate with age, body mass index, duration of diabetes or HbA1c levels.

            "abstract": "A large amount of research continues to be conducted on the mechanisms of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) effects, and the first of the large clinical trials published its results during the past year. In addition to the well known effects on LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, recent studies confirmed that estrogen with or without a progestin lowers lipoprotein (a) concentrations in women (but not in men). In men, estrogen appears to have a similar effect on other lipids and lipoproteins and on plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 as in women. A comparison of estrogen with simvastatin indicated that simvastatin is better at lowering LDL-cholesterol while estrogen is better at raising HDL-cholesterol; when given in combination the additional effects were modest. Estrogen and simvastatin had similar beneficial effects on endothelial function. The estrogen effect on endothelial function may be blocked by medroxyprogesterone, but the data are inconsistent. These studies of intermediate outcomes were put in perspective by the results of a landmark secondary prevention trial of coronary heart disease (CHD). This randomized placebo-controlled trial (Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study) of conjugated equine estrogens plus medroxyprogesterone failed to show the anticipated reduction in CHD, and at the same time the threefold increase in venous thromboembolism confirmed that HRT is procoagulant. Therefore, it is still not known whether HRT is a viable option for the prevention of CHD. The preliminary data on selective estrogen receptor modulators are not overly promising, but a definitive trial to test whether raloxifene will reduce CHD is ongoing."

The genotypes were investigated for relationships with plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels, as well as for the presence of coronary artery disease. As expected, the mean levels of plasma triacylglycerols (triglycerides) and lipoprotein (a) and the number of smokers were significantly higher in the disease group, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was significantly lower. Surprisingly, plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were not different between the two groups.

The main purpose of the study was to test if replacement of trans fatty acids in margarine by palmitic acid results in unfavorable effects on serum lipids. The sum of saturated fatty acids (12:0, 14:0, 16:0) was 36.3% of total fatty acids in the PALM-diet, the same as the sum of saturated (12:0, 14:0, 16:0) (12.5%) and trans (23.1%) fatty acids in the TRANS-diet. This sum was 20.7% in the PUFA-diet. The content of oleic acid was 37.9, 35.2, and 38.6%, respectively, in the three diets, whereas linoleic acid amounted to 16, 13.5, and 27.3%, respectively. Total fat provided 30-31% and the test margarines 26% of total energy in all three diets. The subjects consumed each of the diets for 17 d in a Latin-square crossover design. There were no significant differences in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apoB) between the TRANS- and the PALM-diets. High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apoA-1 were significantly higher on the PALM-diet compared to the TRANS-diet whereas the ratio of LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol was lower, although not significantly (P = 0.077) on the PALM-diet. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apoB were significantly lower on the PUFA-diet compared to the two other diets. HDL-cholesterol was not different on the PALM- and the PUFA-diets but it was significantly lower on the TRANS-diet compared to the PUFA diet. Compared to the PUFA-diet the ratio of LDL- to HDL-cholesterol was higher on both the PALM- and the TRANS-diets whereas apoA-1 was not different. Triglycerides and lipoprotein (a) were not significantly different among the three diets. We concluded that nutritionally, palmitic acid from palm oil may be a reasonable alternative to trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated soybean oil in margarine if the aim is to avoid trans fatty acids. A palm oil-based margarine is, however, less favorable than one based on a more polyunsaturated vegetable oil."

The effect of insulin resistance on the development of clinical events was evaluated by dividing the study group into tertiles of insulin resistance at baseline and comparing the events in these 3 groups. Clinical endpoints (n = 40) were identified in 37 individuals (18%) of those evaluated, including 12 with hypertension, 3 with hypertension + type 2 diabetes, 9 with cancer, 7 with coronary heart disease, 4 with stroke, and 2 with type 2 diabetes. Twenty-eight out of the total 40 clinical events were seen in 25 individuals (36%) in the most insulin-resistant tertile, with the other 12 occurring in the group with an intermediate degree of insulin resistance. Furthermore, insulin resistance was an independent predictor of all clinical events, using both multiple logistic regression and Cox's proportional hazards analysis. The fact that an age-related clinical event developed in approximately 1 out of 3 healthy individuals in the upper tertile of insulin resistance at baseline, followed for an average of 6 yr, whereas no clinical events were observed in the most insulin-sensitive tertile, should serve as a strong stimulus to further efforts to define the role of insulin resistance in the genesis of age-related diseases."

Since triglyceride-rich lipoprotein fractions also contain different concentrations of cholesterol and since the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is not independent from the metabolism of HDL, the variables HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (respectively total-cholesterol) must be taken into account when evaluating the atherosclerotic risk of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. This epidemiological evidence is underlined by clinical observations about the high incidence of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in relation to abnormalities in the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism as in patients with diabetes mellitus, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia and familial combined hyperlipidemia. Very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) from patients with hypertriglyceridemia are enriched in free and esterified cholesterol. This changed composition of these lipoprotein fractions leads to an increased elimination from the circulation via atherogenic macrophages and smooth muscles cell pathways. Successful treatment of hypertriglyceridemic states obviously normalizes the changed composition of the lipoprotein fractions and in consequence effects also the atherogenicity."

Although the number of male patients was 417, significantly more than the 329 female patients, many female patients were elderly, and the age at initial onset was about 10 years older than that of the male patients. Fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c levels increased with the duration of illness. The female patients showed a greater tendency to suffer from hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity than the male patients. There was positive correlation between the incidence of complications and duration of illness. This tendency was more marked in the female patients than in the male patients. Both male and female patients showed a tendency for microangiopathy to appear earlier than macroangiopathy.

The aim was to examine whether an intensified diet education would result in a better metabolic control and greater reduction in cardiovascular risk factors than conventional treatment for obese patients with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, both groups were re-examined after a second year of observation period to find out the maintenance of the results after intervention. After basic education, Int. group participated in 12-months diet education, while Conv. group was treated in local health centres. During the intervention period, only Int. group showed further weight reduction. Only 20% of patients in Int. and 6% of patients in Conv. group had BMI < 27 kg/m2 at the end of the intervention, while 75% of patients in Int. and 52% of patients in Conv. group had achieved a good metabolic control (fasting blood glucose < 6.7 mmol/l; P = 0.005 between groups). Serum total cholesterol did not change significantly, but the changes in HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B level were significant in Int. group only. The proposed acceptable values for serum lipids were achieved by 52 to 88% of patients without major differences between the two groups.

Data were analysed using multi-variable linear regression and generalised additive models, which were adjusted for age, sex, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, BMI and region of residence, to assess the associations of serum Zn concentrations with metabolic risk factors. We observed a negative association between serum Zn concentrations and FG (coefficient = -0·532; 95 % CI -0·569, -0·495; P < 0·001). Moreover, TC (coefficient = 0·175; 95 % CI 0·127, 0·222; P < 0·001), HDL-cholesterol (coefficient = 0·137; 95 % CI 0·082, 0·193; P < 0·001) and LDL-cholesterol (coefficient = 0·195; 95 % CI 0·128, 0·263; P < 0·001) were found to be positively associated with Zn levels. A generalised additive model showed that the negative association between serum Zn and FG was weak at lower serum Zn concentrations and was stronger with the increase in serum Zn concentrations. Additionally, a U-shaped association between serum Zn and TAG was observed. Serum Zn concentrations were associated with FG, TC, TAG, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels in Chinese children and adolescents.

Each of two dietary periods were 15 days in length, and contained 50% of the calories as carbohydrate, 30% as fat, and 20% as protein. The only variable between the two periods was the percentage of total calories as sucrose, 16% v 1%. Fasting blood samples were analyzed for plasma glucose and insulin as well as total plasma VLDL-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. In addition, postprandial blood samples were obtained for the measurement of plasma glucose, insulin and triglyceride concentrations. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and day-long insulin concentrations were similar between the two diets. However, the addition of sucrose in amounts comparable to those typically consumed by the general population resulted in significantly elevated day-long glucose (P less than 0.05) and triglyceride (P less than 0.05) responses, as well as elevated fasting total plasma cholesterol (P less than 0.001), triglyceride (P less than 0.05), VLDL-cholesterol (P less than 0.01), and VLDL-triglyceride (P less than 0.05) concentrations. LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were unchanged during the added sucrose diet. It is clear that the consumption of diets containing moderate amounts of sucrose resulted in changes to plasma lipid and postprandial glucose concentrations that have been identified as risk factors for coronary artery disease. Therefore, it seems prudent at this time to advise patients with NIDDM to avoid added dietary sucrose."

            "abstract": "Type I insulin-dependent diabetic patients have an increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease that may be determined in part by their tendency to develop circulating lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities. The occurrence of such findings in asymptomatic ambulant Type I patients with mild or moderate hyperglycemia might suggest that conventional methods of insulin treatment are as inefficient at normalizing lipid abnormalities as they are in achieving euglycemia. It would then be important to ascertain whether intensive methods of insulin treatment effectively normalized lipid levels. Ten insulin-dependent young adult diabetic patients were studied on a conventional insulin treatment regimen and then at two-monthly intervals for a six-month period during which they were managed by three different intensified insulin treatment regimens. Plasma glucose levels improved substantially (p less than 0.001) after two months of intensified therapy (106 +/- 4 mg/dl) and did not change significantly thereafter for the remaining four months of intensified insulin treatment. Apart from a short-lived decrease in total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol after two months of intensified treatment (baseline total triglyceride 116 +/- 13 mg/dl, total cholesterol 174 +/- 16 mg/dl, HDL-cholesterol 46 +/- 3 mg/dl). There were no persistent changes in serum lipids, lipoprotein cholesterol or in levels of their major apoproteins A-I, A-II and B. These findings support the contention that, despite moderate hyperglycemia, conventional insulin treatment may be adequate to maintain normal lipid levels.

            "abstract": "Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death among patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). NIDDM patients have a high frequency of dyslipidemia, which along with obesity, hypertension, and hyperglycemia may contribute significantly to accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. Because risk factors for coronary heart disease are additive and perhaps multiplicative, even mild degrees of dyslipidemia may enhance coronary heart disease risk. Therefore, therapeutic strategies for management of NIDDM should give equal emphasis to controlling hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. The National Cholesterol Education Program recently issued guidelines for treatment of hyperlipidemia in adults including diabetic patients. Because of the unique features of diabetic dyslipidemia, however, we suggest that certain modifications in these guidelines be made to meet specific needs of diabetic patients. For example, therapeutic goals for serum cholesterol reduction should be lower in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic subjects. Particular emphasis should be given to weight reduction in NIDDM patients. In some diabetic patients, monounsaturated fatty acids may be a better replacement for saturated fatty acids than carbohydrates. The target for cholesterol lowering should include both very-low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (non-high-density lipoprotein) rather than LDL alone. To obtain a substantial reduction of cholesterol levels, drug therapy may be required in many patients. However, first-line drugs for nondiabetic patients (nicotinic acid and bile acid sequestrants) may be less desirable in NIDDM patients than hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors and even fibric acids. In fact, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may be the drugs of choice for NIDDM patients with elevated LDL cholesterol and borderline hypertriglyceridemia, whereas gemfibrozil appears preferable for NIDDM patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia."

The lipid disorders most often encountered in these patients are increased levels of triglycerides, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These abnormalities appear to result from increased hepatic secretion of VLDL particles due to increased concentrations of free fatty acids and glucose, reduced VLDL clearance due to reduced activity of lipoprotein lipase, and reduced LDL clearance due to glycosylation of ligand proteins. Treatment of the dyslipidemia associated with FDH should follow the guidelines from the National Cholesterol Education Program. Treatment in men and women with NIDDM should be considered when LDL cholesterol levels are 130 mg/dl or above, triglyceride levels are 200 mg/dl or above, or non-HDL cholesterol levels are 160 mg/dl or greater. Aggressive lifestyle changes should be initiated first, including weight loss in obese patients, control of glucose levels in those with NIDDM, avoidance of antihypertensive drugs that may worsen lipid levels in patients with FDH, and eating a diet restricting saturated fat and cholesterol. Addition of lipid-altering drugs should be considered if such changes do not achieve effective lipid control. The agent should be tailored to the patient's lipid profile, in general by using bile acid resins, niacin, or reductase inhibitors to lower LDL cholesterol and gemfibrozil or niacin to lower triglycerides. Niacin should be avoided in patients with NIDDM."

PAD patients often show elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL-cholesterol, two lipid abnormalities usually accompanied by decreased LDL size in the \"atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype\" (ALP). We investigated (1) whether PAD patients have lower LDL size, (2) altered LDL subclass distribution and (3) the prevalence of ALP. We measured plasma lipids and LDL size and subclasses by gradient gel electrophoresis in 31 adults with intermittent claudication and 31 age-BMI-matched controls. Patients had higher prevalence of hypertension (p=.0132), smoking (p<.0020) and diabetes (p=.0024), with lower HDL-cholesterol (p<.0001) and increased triglycerides (p=.0057); LDL size was smaller (p<.0001), with decreased larger subclasses (LDL-I, p<.0001; LDL-IIA, p=.0068) and increased smaller particles (LDL-IIIA, p<.0001; LDL-IIIB, p=.0013; LDL-IVA, p=.0029; LDL-IVB, p<.0001). The presence of PAD was independently associated with smoking (OR 7.2, p=.0099), hypertension (OR 6.5, p=.0362), diabetes (OR 5.5, p=.0450) and elevated small, dense LDL (OR 6.7, p=.0497). The concomitant presence of high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol and elevated small, dense LDL in patients was 26% (versus 0% controls, p=.0024). ALP seems to characterize PAD dyslipidemia, but prospective studies are needed to test whether this lipoprotein phenotype may represent a risk factor too."

In the cohort study we were monitoring outpatients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus during a 5 year period. Patients (117 men, 83 women), aged from 30 to 92 years were conducted sampling blood glucose, HbA1c (IFCC/DCCT), HDL, LDL, TG. At baseline, the patients height, weight, waist circumference, calculated BMI and blood pressure were measured. Waist circumference was measured in the horizontal plane in the middle of the distance between the upper edge of the iliac crest and the lower edge of the last rib in the breath. Our study did not exclude patients taking statin or fibrate. The high HbA1c values increased the risk of elevating LDL-cholesterol levels and TAG levels in the whole group (p = 0.012) and (p = 0.017), and the high BMI values increased the risk of lowering HDL-cholesterol levels in the female population (p = 0.010). The results of our study stratify the increased risk of atherogenicity in these groups. HbA1c is a direct marker of elevated LDL and TAG, and indirect marker for coronary artery disease risk assessment."

However, the distribution of apo AIV between apo B- and non-apo B-containing lipoproteins (Lp) during the postprandial state has not been described as well as the influence of obesity on this distribution. Our aim was to study the influence of parameters related to obesity and insulin resistance on the postprandial changes in apo AIV-containing Lp after a high-fat meal in obese women. Twenty-three overweight or obese women (body mass index [BMI] ranging from 29.1 and 64.0 kg.1 m(-2)), for whom blood samples were taken after fasting overnight, participated in the study. Thirteen of these obese women were given a fatty meal and, in this case, blood samples were taken at fast and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion of the fat meal. Apo AIV-containing particle families, Lp B:AIVf (family [f] of particles containing at least apo B and apo AIV) and Lp AIV non-Bf (family [f] of particles containing apo AIV, but free of apo B) were quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). When fasting, Lp B:AIVf and Lp AIV non-Bf did not correlate with any of the parameters related to obesity and insulin resistance, if one excepts a positive correlation between HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and Lp AIV non-Bf. Postprandial lipemia was associated with a trend towards an increase in the plasma levels of apo AIV-containing Lp 6 hours after fat ingestion. The postprandial peak of Lp B:AIVf and Lp AIV non-Bf occurred 2 hours after the triglyceride peak. The distribution between apo B- and non-apo B-containing Lp did not change after ingestion of the fat meal, if one excepts a tendancy towards a lower ratio of bound and nonbound forms at 8 hours. Fasting plasma Lp B:AIVf concentration correlated with the area under the curve (AUC) of plasma triglycerides (beta = 0.11, P <.02). In a multivariate analysis, BMI (beta = 51.85, P <.001), fasting triglycerides (beta = 431.08, P <.01), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (beta = 2638.57, P <.005) were independent and positive determinants of the AUC of Lp AIV non-Bf, while waist circumference (beta = -23.94, P <.001), cholesterol (beta = -1655.02, P <.01), and systolic blood pressure (beta = -6.34, P <.05) were negative and independent determinants of this AUC. Fasting Lp B:AIVf may represent a good marker of the postprandial triglyceride increase in obese women. Changes in apo AIV concentrations in apo B- and non-apo B-containing Lp after a fat meal depend mainly on the degree of obesity rather than on insulin resistance. This effect is more obvious for Lp AIV non-Bf than for Lp B:AIVf."

The present study examines whether these 2 variants exist in the ordinary Japanese non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) population and compares the clinical profile between the 2 discrete forms of NIDDM. In addition, we investigated the factors responsible for insulin resistance observed in Japanese NIDDM populations. One hundred eleven untreated Japanese NIDDM subjects (fasting glucose < 10 mmol/L) were assessed for insulin action (homeostasis model assessment [HOMA-IR] = fasting serum insulin (microU/mL) x fasting plasma glucose (mmol/L)/22.5) and the fasting lipid profile. Sixty percent of these patients had normal insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR < 2.5). The insulin-resistant patients had higher serum cholesterol (188.1 +/- 5.2 v 182.2 +/- 3.9 mg/dL, P> .05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (501.2 +/- 16.7 v 469.4 +/- 14.8 mg/dL, P > .05) than the insulin-sensitive patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the former group had a significantly higher body mass index ([BMI] 26.6 +/- 0.8 v 21.7 +/- 0.4 kg/m2, P < .0001) and higher serum triglycerides (181.0 +/- 16.4 (range, 79 to 545) v 95.1 +/- 4.1 (range, 36 to 204) mg/dL, P < .0001) and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (47.2 +/- 1.7 v 58.2 +/- 2.5 mg/dL, P < .005) than the latter group. HOMA-IR was related to the BMI. Fifteen of 17 (88%) NIDDM patients with a BMI greater than 27.0 were insulin-resistant, whereas 35 of 38 (92%) NIDDM patients with a BMI less than 21.5 were insulin-sensitive. In the midrange BMI (21.5 to 27.0 kg/m2), patients were equally likely to be insulin-resistant or insulin-sensitive. Analysis of the midrange BMI group showed that HOMA-IR was associated with serum triglycerides (P < .0001) but not with the BMI. These data suggest the following conclusions: (1) Japanese NIDDM patients can be classified into 2 populations, one with normal insulin sensitivity and the other with insulin resistance; (2) NIDDM patients with normal insulin action have a low cardiovascular disease risk factor, whereas those with insulin resistance have a markedly increased cardiovascular disease risk factor; and (3) the BMI and serum triglyceride level per se are associated with insulin action in Japanese NIDDM populations."

Despite the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of these flavonoids, one of the mechanisms by which proanthocyanidins exert their cardiovascular protection is improving lipid homeostasis. Animal studies demonstrate that proanthocyanidins reduce the plasma levels of atherogenic apolipoprotein B-triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and LDL-cholesterol but increase antiatherogenic HDL-cholesterol. The results in humans, however, are less clear. This review summarizes the results that have been published on plasma triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels in humans and animal models in response to proanthocyanidin extracts and proanthocyanidin-rich foods. The physiological processes and biochemical pathways that are related to lipid homeostasis and affected by proanthocyanidin consumption are also discussed. Intestinal lipid absorption, chylomicron secretion by the intestine and VLDL secretion by the liver are the processes that are most repressed by proanthocyanidins, which, therefore, induce hypolipidemic effects."

There was a significant difference between bunazosin and atenolol for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-triglycerides and apolipoprotein B levels.

Impaired insulin secretion, insulin insensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue, and elevated hepatic glucose production are the major pathophysiological features of NIDDM. Insulin insensitivity is also a feature of the insulin resistance syndrome, which describes the epidemiological association of glucose intolerance, upper body obesity, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertension, increased triglyceride levels and decreased high-density-lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentrations. Insulin insensitivity has been found to be a familial trait, and this raises the hypothesis that the insulin resistance syndrome may also occur as a familial trait in caucasian families in association with the development of NIDDM. The 90 first degree relatives of 50 caucasian subjects with NIDDM were studied with a continuous infusion glucose tolerance test to quantitate glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, fasting triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol measurements were obtained, and the intercorrelations between these variables were examined. As a group the first degree relatives had a median insulin sensitivity of 65% (interquartile range 46-99%). Insulin sensitivity was univariately correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol. These associations were present in both the hyperglycaemic and the normoglycaemic relatives. The hyperglycaemic relatives were significantly more insulin insensitive than the normoglycaemic relatives, but this additional insulin insensitivity was not associated with significant differences in blood pressure, triglyceride or HDL-cholesterol concentrations. Our data indicate that the insulin insensitivity present in the first degree relatives of subjects with NIDDM is correlated with the cardiovascular risk factors which make up the insulin resistance syndrome, and that glycaemic status does not appear to be the major determinant of these associations. Interventions targeting obesity and insulin insensitivity in these subjects may reduce cardiovascular risk."

            "abstract": "The results of 8 major hypertension treatment trials, all using diuretics as first-line therapy, show a clear-cut reduction in stroke and congestive heart failure, but coronary heart disease (CHD) is not consistently benefited. It is unclear why CHD is not controlled, but diuretics can subtly upset metabolic risk factors for CHD, among which are lipid and glucose concentrations. Although these metabolic disturbances appear clinically unimpressive, risk table analysis reveals that they can offset or even reverse the benefits of reducing blood pressure. A link between glucose intolerance and increased serum lipid concentrations during diuretic-based therapy is suggested by multiple correlations between them. Replacement of diuretics as first-line therapy for mild and moderate hypertension should therefore be considered. Spironolactone seems to counter the adverse metabolic effects, but its effect on lipoproteins needs more study. A drug that does not disturb glucose and lipid metabolism would seem preferable. Thus prazosin is a promising candidate."

As a consequence, there has also been a marked increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes all over the world and this chronic metabolic disease is now considered as a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. However, even in the absence of the hyperglycaemic state which characterizes type 2 diabetic patients, non diabetic individuals with a specific form of obesity, named abdominal obesity, often show clustering metabolic abnormalities which include high triglyceride levels, increased apolipoprotein B, small dense low density lipoproteins and decreased high density lipoproteins-cholesterol levels, a hyperinsulinemic-insulin resistant state, alterations in coagulation factors as well as an inflammatory profile. This agglomeration of abnormalities has been referred to as the metabolic syndrome which can be identified by the presence of three of the five following variables: abdominal obesity, elevated triglyceride concentrations, low HDL-cholesterol levels, increased blood pressure and elevated fasting glucose. Post-mortem analyses of coronary arteries have indicated that obesity (associated with a high accumulation of abdominal fat measured at autopsy) was predictive of earlier and greater extent of large vessels atherosclerosis as well as increase of coronary fatty streaks. Metabolic syndrome linked to abdominal obesity is also predictive of recurrent coronary events both in post-myocardial infarction patients and among coronary artery disease men who underwent a revascularization procedures. It is suggested that until the epidemic progression of obesity is stopped and obesity prevented or at least properly managed, cardiologists will be confronted to an evolving contribution of risk factors where smoking, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension may be relatively less prevalent but at the expense of a much greater contribution of abdominal obesity and related features of the metabolic syndrome."

Each cardiovascular risk factor, such as blood pressure, fasting glucose, fasting lipids and the 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease was tested for its relation to climacteric complaints. Greene's climacteric scale, and its subscales were used to evaluate climacteric symptoms. Analyses were corrected for confounders derived by personal history and anthropometric measures. When corrected for confounders, Greene's score was a positive determinant of triglycerides (R(2 )= 0.249; p = 0.0001), triglycerides/HDL-cholesterol (R(2 )= 0.316; p = 0.0001), glucose (R(2 )= 0.101; p = 0.0003), and the 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease, calculated by the Framingham formula (R(2 )= 0.081; p = 0.0001).

Cigarette smoking shows the highest prevalence (54%), followed by hypertension (39%), overweight (38.6%) and hypercholesterolaemia (34.7%). In patients over 65 the prevalence of these coronary risk factors is lower, whereas physical inactivity and diabetes are more frequent than in the younger group. Combinations of the main coronary risk factors are much more frequent in the younger group. HDL-cholesterol was found to be lower than normal (below 0.91 mmol/l) in 27% irrespective of age. The lower the concentration of HDL-cholesterol the more frequent are the following coronary risk factors: smoking, overweight, diabetes, physical inactivity and hypertriglyceridaemia. We suspect that a low HDL-cholesterol concentration in many individuals may be the result of a clustering of the aforementioned risk factors. For practical purposes it seems important to evaluate all relevant risk factors in an individual and to concentrate intervention on those with a fair chance of success, especially smoking and hypertension in the younger subjects. Normal or elevated HDL-cholesterol in itself is not a reliable cardioprotective factor since it is normal or elevated in two thirds of our coronary heart disease patients."

Frequency of hyperhomocysteinemia was 53% in the vegans group, 28% in vegetarians vs. 5% in omnivores. In conditions of lower methionine intake (reduced content in plant proteins), the remethylation pathway of homocysteine metabolism prevails and it is vitamin B12 and folate-dependent. The intake of vitamin B12 is equal to zero in vegans; vegetarians consume 124% of the RDA vs. 383% in omnivores. Serum vitamin levels are significantly lower in subjects consuming alternative nutrition with deficiency observed in 24% of vegetarians, 78% of vegans vs. 0% in omnivores. Serum folate levels are within the reference range in all groups. Mild hyperhomocysteinemia in the groups consuming alternative diet is a consequence of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vegetarians and vegans meet the RDA for energy and fat, and have a favourable proportion of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids on total energy intake; the ratio of linoleic/alpha-linolenic acid in their diet corresponds with the recommendations. They have low cholesterol consumption and higher vitamin E and C intake. Optimal fat intake of correct composition is reflected in lower values of atherosclerosis risk factors (cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, atherogenic index, saturated fatty acids, triacylglycerols), and significantly higher levels of protective substances (linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, HDL-cholesterol, vitamin E, vitamin E/cholesterol, vitamin C). Low lipid risk factors but higher findings of mild hyperhomocysteinemia in vegetarians mean a diminished protective effect of alternative nutrition in cardiovascular disease prevention."

Previous research reports indicated that uric acid metabolism plays a role in the pathogenesis of NIDDM. To investigate this hypothesis, we studied 53 NIDDM patients by using a double blind cross over control study, of allopurinol and placebo administration. We found a statistically significant elevation in the level of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after the allopurinol intervention period of 12 weeks compared with the placebo period of the same duration (p less than 0.003). The elevation was also found in a subgroup with Body Mass Index (BMI) less than 25 kg/m2 (p less than 0.001) and BMI more than or equal to 25 kg/m2 (p less than 0.05).

            "title": "Effect of a Low-Fat Vegan Diet on Body Weight, Insulin Sensitivity, Postprandial Metabolism, and Intramyocellular and Hepatocellular Lipid Levels in Overweight Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial.",
            "abstract": "## IMPORTANCE\nExcess body weight and insulin resistance lead to type 2 diabetes and other major health problems. There is an urgent need for dietary interventions to address these conditions.\n## OBJECTIVE\nTo measure the effects of a low-fat vegan diet on body weight, insulin resistance, postprandial metabolism, and intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipid levels in overweight adults.\n## DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nThis 16-week randomized clinical trial was conducted between January 2017 and February 2019 in Washington, DC. Of 3115 people who responded to flyers in medical offices and newspaper and radio advertisements, 244 met the participation criteria (age 25 to 75 years; body mass index of 28 to 40) after having been screened by telephone.\n## INTERVENTIONS\nParticipants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group (n = 122) was asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet and the control group (n = 122) to make no diet changes for 16 weeks.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nAt weeks 0 and 16, body weight was assessed using a calibrated scale. Body composition and visceral fat were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was assessed with the homeostasis model assessment index and the predicted insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM). Thermic effect of food was measured by indirect calorimetry over 3 hours after a standard liquid breakfast (720 kcal). In a subset of participants (n = 44), hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids were quantified by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis.\n## RESULTS\nAmong the 244 participants in the study, 211 (87%) were female, 117 (48%) were White, and the mean (SD) age was 54.4 (11.6) years. Over the 16 weeks, body weight decreased in the intervention group by 5.9 kg (95% CI, 5.0-6.7 kg; P < .001). Thermic effect of food increased in the intervention group by 14.1% (95% CI, 6.5-20.4; P < .001). The homeostasis model assessment index decreased (-1.3; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.3; P < .001) and PREDIM increased (0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2; P < .001) in the intervention group. Hepatocellular lipid levels decreased in the intervention group by 34.4%, from a mean (SD) of 3.2% (2.9%) to 2.4% (2.2%) (P = .002), and intramyocellular lipid levels decreased by 10.4%, from a mean (SD) of 1.6 (1.1) to 1.5 (1.0) (P = .03). None of these variables changed significantly in the control group over the 16 weeks. The change in PREDIM correlated negatively with the change in body weight (r = -0.43; P < .001). Changes in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels correlated with changes in insulin resistance (both r = 0.51; P = .01).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nA low-fat plant-based dietary intervention reduces body weight by reducing energy intake and increasing postprandial metabolism. The changes are associated with reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular fat and increased insulin sensitivity.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02939638.\n"

All 2113 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus referring to the Diabetic Clinic of Asti were studied. Patients were divided into tertiles of body mass index, according to their sex (BMI < 26.9; >/= 26.9 and < 31.4; >/= 31.4 kg/m(2) for females and BMI < 25.7; >/= 25.7 and < 28.8; >/= 28.8 kg/m(2) for males). Age, BMI, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, HbA(1c) total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and prevalence of insulin treatment and hypertension were higher in females, whereas exercise, alcohol intake, smoking habits and prevalence of dyslipidemia were higher in males. An increase in BMI was associated with an increase in HbA(1c), number of cigarettes/day, blood pressure, triglycerides, C-peptide, prevalence of hypertension and dyslipidemia, and with a decrease in age, duration of diabetes and HDL-cholesterol values. In spite of an apparently worse cardiovascular risk profile, females showed a 50% lower prevalence of CAD than males and the prevalence of CAD was not significantly different in obese compared to other BMI categories. Multiple logistic regression showed that risk factors for CAD were different in males and females and similar in the lower tertiles of BMI, while different in the highest. In obese females, risk factors for CAD were age, reduced HDL-cholesterol and increased HbA(1c) levels; in males they were years of smoking and duration of diabetes. These data suggest that in type 2 diabetes, risk factors for CAD are different in the two sexes and in patients with the highest BMI compared to the normal and overweight subjects; blood glucose control and duration of diabetes seem more important than conventional cardiovascular risk factors in obese patients."

            "abstract": "Prevalence of diabetic nephropathy varies in different racial groups, being especially high in communities that have abandoned an active traditional living and embraced a modern but sedentary life-style. As a new and rapidly developing country, Saudi Arabia has witnessed impressive changes in socio-economic growth and development and concurrently, a disturbing trend in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). These observations therefore prompted us to investigate the prevalence of microalbuminuria among Saudi Arabians with NIDDM. Two hundred and eleven patients attending a large Diabetic Clinic in Riyadh were screened for microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 h). Twenty-seven subjects had clinical proteinuria (dipstick-positive) and were excluded, leaving 184 cases for analysis. Seventy-six subjects (76/184, 41.3%) had microalbuminuria. These subjects had higher fasting plasma glucose concentrations (P = 0.002) and greater body mass index (P = 0.049) than subjects with normal albumin excretion rate (< 30 mg/24 h). There were no significant differences between subjects with and without microalbuminuria with regards to fasting total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides concentrations, frequency of hypertension, duration of diabetes or type of therapy for diabetes. In multivariate analysis, glycaemia (P < 0.005) and years since diagnosis of diabetes (P = 0.05) remained independently associated with albumin excretion rate. We conclude that microalbuminuria is exceedingly common in a clinic-based population of Saudi Arabians with NIDDM and its presence is closely related to glycaemic control. Whether the prevalence of microalbuminuria is truly increased in the diabetic population at large in Saudi Arabia must now await further population-based studies."

Peripheral vascular diseases (PVD) were present in 45% of patients with HTG and in 32% of patients without lipid disorders. In both groups patients with PVD had lower HDL-cholesterol (p less than 0.05 resp. p less than 0.0005) and higher VLDL-cholesterol (p less than 0.025 resp. p less than 0.005). A negative relationship between VLDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol was only significant in IDDM without lipid disorders (p less than 0.001). Considering a ratio of VLDL/HDL-cholesterol of greater than or equal to 1.0 resp. less than 1.0 to be discriminating for patients with or without PVD 65.1% of all PVD (specifity) and 60.7% of all Non-PVD (sensitivity) could be correctly characterized. It is concluded, that in IDDM the ratio of VLDL/HDL-cholesterol is a better indicator for the arteriosclerotic risk than total triglycerides or total cholesterol."

Seoul Metabolic Syndrome cohort study includes 1370 participants suspected of metabolic syndrome. For causal mediation analysis, the dataset for 2016 including 847 participants with coronary computed tomography without any missing value were analysed using the Mediation package in R software. This study identified a causal mediation mechanism of HDL-cholesterol among the five biochemical factors. It implied that statin treatment increases the HDL-cholesterol level, leading to decreasing the probability of CAC score > 0. Estimated values of interest in HDL-cholesterol mediation were (1) average causal mediation effect, -0.011 with 95% CI [-0.025, -0.003], (2) average direct effect, 0.143 with 95% CI [0.074, 0.219], and total effect, 0.132 with 95% CI [0.063, 0.209].

Mean LDL particle diameter was determined using 2-16% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. LDL particle diameters in CAD patients were much smaller than those in controls (25.2+/-0.7 vs. 26.0+/-0.4 nm, mean+/-S.D., P<0.0001). LDL size was smaller in diabetic subjects (25.6+/-0.6 nm) and became even smaller in diabetics with CAD (25.0+/-1.0 nm). Prevalence of small dense LDL was markedly higher in both non-diabetic and diabetic CAD patients than that in non-diabetic and diabetic patients without CAD (71, 76, 23 and 42%, respectively). CAD patients had lower HDL-cholesterol and apo A1 levels, and higher triglyceride levels than those in diabetic and non-diabetic CAD-free patients, while total- and LDL-cholesterol levels were even lower in CAD group, and remnant-like particle-cholesterol, lipoprotein (a) and insulin levels were comparable among four groups. LDL size was significantly associated with triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and glycemic control. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the small dense LDL phenotype was significantly associated with the incidence of CAD independent of low levels of HDL-cholesterol or high levels of triglyceride in both non-diabetic and diabetic cases. These results suggest that high prevalence of small dense LDL is a leading cause of CAD in both diabetic and non-diabetic Japanese men.

Myeloperoxidase, a haeme protein secreted by activated phagocytes, oxidizes L-tyrosine to a tyrosyl radical that is a physiological catalyst for the initiation of lipid oxidation in LDL. Lipid oxidation results in the generation of aldehydes that substitute lysine residues in the apolipoprotein B-100 moiety. Lipid together with protein oxidation in LDL results in the generation of oxidized LDL. We, among others, have demonstrated an association between coronary heart disease (CHD) and increased plasma levels of oxidized LDL. Recently, we have demonstrated a higher prevalence of elevated oxidized LDL in persons with high-calculated CHD risk prior to events. The odds of having elevated oxidized LDL for persons with high-calculated CHD risk prior to events were even higher than for persons with diagnosed CHD. A likely explanation is that once CHD has been diagnosed the patients are more treated with a statin that appears to decrease oxidized LDL even beyond its cholesterol-lowering effect. We have identified several metabolic syndrome components (high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol, glucose intolerance and diabetes) that independently of LDL-cholesterol, predicted high levels of oxidized LDL. Finally, elevated oxidized LDL predicted myocardial infarction in the Health ABC cohort consisting of well-functioning elderly people, even after adjusting for age, gender, race, smoking, and the metabolic syndrome."

Some of these studies are designed to evaluate the effects of drugs acting primarily on triglycerides, such as the fibrates, or showing both, triglyceride and cholesterol reduction, like some newer statins, especially atorvastatin. The dyslipidemia encountered most frequently with diabetics is an increase of triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol. Because of the high cardiovascular risk of diabetics the target levels of LDL-cholesterol in secondary and primary prevention should not exceed 100 mg/dl as in secondary prophylaxis in patients without diabetes."

            "abstract": "The present study investigated the effects of soybean leaf extracts (SLEs) on blood glucose, insulin resistance, body fat and dyslipidemia in prediabetes subjects, and compared them with the effects of banaba extracts (BE) which is known to ameliorate diabetes in several animals and clinical studies. Overweight subjects with mild hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose level of 100-125 mg dL(-1)) were randomly assigned to three groups and administered four capsules containing starch (2 g per day, Placebo), BE (300 mg per day, 0.3% corosolic acid) or SLE (2 g per day) during regular meals for 12 weeks. The SLE as well as BE significantly decreased the baseline-adjusted final blood glucose, HbA1c, HOMA-IR and transaminase levels compared to the placebo group. The body weight, BMI and WHR were not different between the groups, but the baseline-adjusted final body fat content and waist circumference were lower in the BE and SLE groups than in the placebo group. Furthermore, the baseline-adjusted final plasma triglyceride concentration was lower in the BE and SLE groups compared to the placebo group. There were no significant differences in plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations between the groups. However, the SLE, but not the BE, significantly increased the plasma HDL-cholesterol concentration and the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to total cholesterol after 12 weeks of supplementation compared to the placebo group, while the atherogenic index was decreased. Taken together, these data suggest that SLE may play an important role in improving blood glucose, insulin resistance, adiposity, and dyslipidemia in prediabetes subjects consuming their habitual diet, similar to or better than BE."

            "abstract": "Objective:\n        \n      \n      In familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), the metabolism and anti-atherogenic functions of HDL can be affected by the continuous interactions with excess LDL amounts. Here, lipid transfers to HDL, an important step for HDL intravascular metabolism and for HDL role in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) were investigated in FH patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-one FH patients (39 ± 15 years, LDL-cholesterol=274 ± 101; HDL-cholesterol=50 ± 14 mg/dl) and 66 normolipidemic subjects (NL) (38 ± 11 years, LDL-cholesterol=105 ± 27; HDL-cholesterol=52 ± 12 mg/dl) were studied. In vitro, lipid transfers were evaluated by incubation of plasma samples (37°C, 1h) with a donor lipid nanoemulsion labeled with 3H-triglycerides (TG) and 14C-unesterified cholesterol (UC) or with 3H-cholesteryl ester (EC) and 14C-phospholipids (PL). Radioactivity was counted at the HDL fraction after chemical precipitation of apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing lipoproteins and the nanoemulsion. Data are % of total radioactivity measured in the HDL fraction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Transfer of UC to HDL was lower in FH than in NL (5.6 ± 2.1 vs 6.7 ± 2.0%, p=0.0005) whereas TG (5.5 ± 3.1 vs 3.7 ± 0.9%, p=0.018) and PL (20.9 ± 4.6 vs 18.2 ± 3.7 %, p=0.023) transfers were higher in FH. EC transfer was equal. By multivariate analysis, transfers of all four lipids correlated with HDL-cholesterol and with apo A-I.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      FH elicited marked changes in three of the four tested lipid transfers to HDL. The entry of UC into HDL for subsequent esterification is an important driving force for RCT and reduction of UC transfer to HDL was previously associated to precocious coronary heart disease. Therefore, in FH, HDL functions can be lessened, which can also contribute to atherogenesis."

            "title": "Risk factors and cardiovascular disease in Turkey.",
            "abstract": "Cardiovascular risk factors as well as morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease among Turkish adults are herein reviewed. Lipids and lipoproteins are in focus, but other relevant risk factors are also discussed. Turks have distinctively low levels of total and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, associated with high levels of hepatic lipase and fasting triglycerides. In addition, physical inactivity is common in both genders; close to 60% of men have the smoking habit, while obesity is common among Turkish women leading to a high prevalence of hypertension and diabetes in them. These factors probably account for the unanticipated fact that Turkish adults have the pattern of causes of death similar to a developed population, although the process of industrialization is ongoing, the structure of its population is young and overall cholesterol levels are comparatively low. The age-standardized coronary heart disease death rate is estimated to rank among the highest in Europe. The leading independent predictors of coronary events and death [systolic blood pressure, total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, followed by diabetes and (central) obesity] are related to the metabolic syndrome, estimated to prevail in 3-4% of adults aged 30 or over, and to underlie one-eighth of cases of coronary disease. Since several adverse factors exhibit a rising trend, primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease must assume a much higher priority in various issues in Turkey than it currently does."

            "abstract": "There is experimental evidence to suggest that hypercholesterolaemia may play a pathogenetic role in progressive glomerular injury. We investigated the effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in 34 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Patients were randomly assigned in a single-blind fashion to treatment with either lovastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (n = 16; mean dose 30.0 +/- 12.6 mg/day) or placebo (n = 18) for 2 years. Renal function was assessed by serially measuring the serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (using Cr51-EDTA), and 24-h urinary protein excretion. Lovastatin treatment was associated with significant reductions in total cholesterol (p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and apo B (p < 0.01), the reductions at 24 months being 26, 30 and 18%, respectively. Beneficial effects on serum triglyceride, HDL-cholesterol and apo A1 levels were also observed. Lp(a) showed no significant change in both groups. Glomerular filtration rate deteriorated significantly in the placebo group after 24 months (p < 0.025) but showed no significant change in the lovastatin-treated patients. The increase in serum creatinine was statistically significant (p < 0.02) in placebo-treated patients at 12 and 24 months, and in the lovastatin group after 24 months. Twenty-four hour urinary protein excretion increased in both groups (p < 0.05). Lovastatin treatment was not associated with significant elevations in liver or muscle enzymes. We conclude that effective normalisation of hypercholesterolaemia may retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy."

Patients who met entry criteria received, under double-blind conditions, policosanol (5 mg) or placebo tablets twice a day for 12 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Policosanol (10 mg/day) significantly reduced total cholesterol by 17.5% and LDL cholesterol by 21.8% compared with baseline and placebo. Furthermore, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was raised by 11.3% (not significant), and triglycerides showed a statistically nonsignificant decrease of 6.6%. These changes in lipid profile were similar to those induced by policosanol in nondiabetic patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Glycemic control was unaffected by treatment. No clinically or biochemically adverse effects attributable to treatment were observed. Only one patient (placebo) withdrew from the trial because of an adverse experience (erythema).

Meanwhile, some food compounds, such as coffee, can also have beneficial effects on CVD risk factors. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between coffee consumption and CVD risk factors in the elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This cross-sectional study was performed during 2017 on 300 elderly people above 60 years of age with T2DM in Isfahan, Iran. Dietary assessment was performed using a food frequency questionnaire. Coffee consumption was classified into three groups including < 1, 1-3, and > 3 cups/day. Partial correlation test was used to investigate the relationship between CVD risk factors and usual coffee consumption.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean age and body mass index of participants were 70.04 ± 4.87 years and 24.74 ± 3.34 kg/m2 respectively.

Triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) had a significant positive relationship with coffee consumption levels (r: 0.636, 0.128; p: 0.028, 0.029). These results were obtained after controlling for potential confounders.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Increasing coffee consumption was linked to improved status of some CVD risk factors including FPG, HDL-C, and DBP in the elderly with T2DM. Nevertheless, increasing coffee consumption was also associated with higher TG level and had no significant effect on other risk factors. Further studies are required to confirm these results."
