RESULTS: One hundred eighteen subjects (mean age: 51.1 years,
females: 78%) were enrolled. The total participation rate at the end
of the study was 84.7%. No differences between the 2 diets in body
weight were observed, as reported by similar and significant reductions
obtained by both Vd (‒1.88 kg) and MD (‒1.77 kg). Similar results were
observed for body mass index and fat mass. In contrast, significant
differences between the 2 interventions were obtained for low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and vitamin B levels. The difference

between the Vd and MD groups, in terms of end-of-diet values, was
recorded at 9.10 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01),
12.70 mg/dL for triglycerides (P<0.01), and 32.32 pg/mL for vitamin B

(P<0.01). Finally, no significant difference was found between Vd and
MD interventions in oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines,
except for interleukin-17, which improved only in the MD group. Forty-six
participants during the Vd period and 35 during the MD period reached
the target values for ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Both Vd and MD were effective in reducing body weight,
body mass index, and fat mass, with no significant differences between
them. However, Vd was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein
