of a multicomponent worksite intervention
SMishra1,ND Barnard1,2,JGonzales3,JXu1, UAgarwal1 and SLevin3
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Toassess theeffects on macro-and micronutrient intakeof anutrition intervention programin
corporate settings across theUnited States.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Twohundred and ninety-twoindividuals whowereoverweight orhad type 2diabeteswere recruited
from 10sitesof aUSinsurance company.Twohundred and seventy-oneparticipants completedbaseline dietrecalls, and 183
participantscompleteddietaryrecallsat18weeks.Siteswererandomlyassignedtoaninterventiongroup(fivesites)ortoacontrol
group(fivesites)for18weeks.Atinterventionsites,participantswereaskedtofollowalow-fatvegandietandattendweeklygroup
meetings. Atcontrol sites,participants continuedtheir usualdiets. At baseline and18weeks, participants completed2-daydiet
recalls. Between-group differences inchanges innutrient intakewereassessed using an analysisofcovariance.
RESULTS:Comparedwiththoseinthecontrolgroup,intervention-groupparticipantssignificantlyreducedthereportedintakeof
totalfat(P¼0.02),saturated(P¼0.006)andmonounsaturatedfats(P¼0.01),cholesterol(P¼0.009),protein(P¼0.03)andcalcium
