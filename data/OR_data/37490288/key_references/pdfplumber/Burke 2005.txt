Abstract
Background: Obesity, a disorder associated with a myriad of comorbidities, is increasing at an alarming rate around the world.
Giventhatpharmacotherapyhaslimitedavailableoptionsandthatbariatricsurgeryisreservedforthosewhoaremorbidlyobeseor
whohavesignificantcomorbidities,themostcommonapproachtothetreatmentofobesityisstandardbehavioraltreatment.This
approachincludesbehaviormodificationrelatedtoeatingandactivityhabits.Thepurposeofthispaperistodescribetherationale,
design, methods and baseline sample characteristics of a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention in weight loss
management, referredto as thePREFER study.
Methods: ThePREFERstudy,usingafour-groupdesign,includes:(1)arandomizationschemethatpermitsparticipantstoindicate
a preferred dietary treatment approach, and (2) two dietary options, one of which is a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet that has
demonstrated potential for long-term adherence. The intervention (32 treatment sessions) is delivered over 12 months and is
followedbya6-month maintenance phase; final assessment occursat18months.
Results: We screened 932 individuals and randomized 197 to the study: Treatment Preference-Yes (n=84) and Treatment
Preference-No (n=98). To maintain abalance across the four treatment groups, 15subjects who preferred the standard diet had
to be discarded from the Treatment Preference-Yes group. Retention at 18 months for the first of three cohorts was 82%.

1. Introduction and background
Accordingtothe1999–2000NationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey(NHANES)estimates,obesityis
increasingatanalarmingrate[1].In1999,theprevalenceofadultobesitywas18.9%andtodayitis33%,while31%
ofadultsintheU.S.areoverweight[http://www.cdc.gov,accessFeb.2,2005].Severeormorbidobesityaffects4.7%
ofU.S.adults[2].CountriesoutsidetheU.S.areshowingsimilartrendswithdevelopingcountriesreportingafaster
increase in prevalence compared to developed countries, and increases occurring in the more affluent families.
According to International Obesity Task Force estimates, 1 billion people are overweight and 300 million are obese
[task force site http:www.iotf.org, access Feb. 2, 2005].
Obesity is associated with a myriad of medical conditions, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, gallstones,
osteoarthritis, sleep apnea and certain cancers [1]. It is also associated with several of the risk factors for coronary
heartdisease(CHD),e.g.,insulinresistance,metabolicsyndrome,andinflammation[1,3–5].However,weightlossis
associated with reduced symptoms,improved function,andmetabolic benefits are seenwithamodestloss of 5%of
initial weight [6].
Treatment for obesity includes pharmacotherapy, which is limited, and surgery, which is indicated only in those
who are morbidly obese or have serious comorbidities [4]. The more common form of treatment is cognitive-
behavioraltherapy,whichincludesbehaviormodification,dietaryinterventionandphysicalactivityandreferredtoas
standardbehaviortreatment(SBT)[7].Numerousdietaryapproacheshavebeenstudiedbutthestandardapproachisa
low-fat diet (b25% of calories from fat) with a calorie deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal per day, which will result in an
initial weight loss of 1 to 2 lb per week. Calorie prescription is usually based on the person’s initial weight, e.g., a
personweighingN200lbwouldfollowa1500kcal/dayeatingplan.Inadditiontorestrictingenergyintake,physical
activity goals, usually set at being physically active at least 30 min per day most days of the week, aim to increase
energyexpenditure.Variousapproachestothebehavioraltreatmentofobesityhavebeenstudiedforover20years[8].
The most significant achievement in these two decades has been in substantial initial weight loss. However,
maintaining weight loss in the long-term is problematic. Typically, individuals regain approximately 35% of their
lost weight in the year following cessation of treatment, and return to their baseline weight within 3 to 5 years.
Therefore,thegreatestchallengeinthetreatmentofthisdisorderisidentifyingstrategiesthatcanimprovelong-term
maintenance of weight loss. With this challenge in mind, we designed the PREFER study.
The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale, design, methods and baseline sample characteristics of the
PREFER study, a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention program in weight loss management. The
PREFERstudydesignincludes:(1)arandomizationschemethatpermitsparticipantstochoosetheirpreferreddietary
treatment approach, and (2) a lacto-ovo-vegetarian (LOV) dietary option that has demonstrated, in the literature,
potential for long-term adherence. The LOV diet is compared to a standard calorie and fat restricted diet.
ThefirstfactorinthePREFERstudyiseffectoftreatmentpreferenceorchoiceofoutcome.Anemergingbodyof

satisfaction with medical care [9–14]. Three studies that used treatment choice in weight loss had methodological
limitations,suchasnonstandardizedtreatmentgroups,asmallsampleandhighattritionrates,butshowedpromisefor
better adherence and weight loss and less regain among those who received their choice condition. However,

desire for involvement in decision-making and satisfaction with medical care.
Preference for decision-making is more common among younger, more educated persons [15]. Individuals born
afterWorldWarIIrepresentacohortthathasbeenpartofasocietalshifttowardincreasedinvolvementinhealth-care
decision-making [16]. Individuals who value control over their health care derive satisfaction from participating in
health-related decision-making [17,18]. Not only is satisfaction an important attribute of quality care [19], but it is
also associated with improved health status and therapeutic outcome [20]. These findings suggest that providing
individualstheirtreatmentpreferenceandinvolvingthemindecision-makingmayresultinimprovedoutcomes.Thus,
the PREFER study design, which has overcome the limitations of the previous studies that examined treatment
preference, permits the investigators to explore the influence of dietary preference on weight loss and maintenance.
The second factor in the PREFER study is that some participants will be assigned to a lacto-ovo-vegetarian
eating plan. As a group, vegetarians provide a striking contrast to the temporary adoption of lifestyle habits or
bdietsQ common among the overweight and obese. Individuals who adopt a vegetarian meal plan report following it
36 L.E.Burkeetal./ContemporaryClinicalTrials27(2006)34–48
for longer periods than those following weight loss diets [21–23]. Research has shown that a vegetarian eating plan
can be followed for sustained periods [21,22]. In studies not focused on weight loss but rather on cardiovascular
risk reduction, Singh reported significant weight loss at one year [24], and Ornish reported maintenance of that loss
at five years [24–26].
Besides improved duration and long-term weight loss, it appears that there is also improved adherence to
vegetarian diets[27,28].Ina review of30studiesprescribingdietarymodification forcardiovascularrisk reduction,

2. Objectives of the PREFER study
The primary aim of the PREFER study is to test the effect of the interaction between treatment assignment
(standard behavior treatment [SBT]+standard weight loss diet vs. standard behavior treatment–lacto-ovo-vegetarian
diet [SBT+LOV]) and dietary treatment preference on weight loss at 18 months. Second, we are interested in the
effectoftheinteractionbetweenthetwotreatmentassignmentconditionsandthetwotreatmentpreferenceconditions
on weight loss. Our secondary aims include describing participants’ preferences for weight loss treatment by
individualcharacteristics;testingtheinteractionbetweentreatmentassignmentandtreatmentpreferenceonadherence
to the diet and physical activity goals; and finally, to test the effect of the interaction between treatment assignment
and treatment preference on serum lipids, glucose, and insulin.

directmailingfrompurchasedlists.RefertoFig.2fornumberofparticipantsateachstage.Eligibilityscreeningtook
approximately six to eight weeks and included several steps. First, 931 responders to the audix or mailings were
screened via a brief telephone interview that assessed basic inclusion criteria (e.g., age, height and weight to
determine body mass index (BMI)). See Table 1 for full list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Five hundred and
seven individuals did not meet eligibility criteria for the following reasons: subject called back to report she was
vegetarian (n=1, .2%), outside the age criteria (n=26, 5.1%), outside the BMI criteria (n=199, 39.4%), pregnant
(n=5, 1%), currently or in past six months in weight loss program (n=62, 12.3%), taking weight loss medication
(n=12,2.4%),receivingmedicationsorcounselingforpsychologicalproblems(n=155,24.7%),interferingmedical
problems such as diabetes (n=20, 4%), and not available the evenings of the treatment sessions (n=423, 83.59%).
The cumulative total exceeds 100% since individuals may have not met criteria for more than one reason, but since
we werenotpermitted toassignID numbersat thephone screening stage, we could nottrack thedata byindividual

Individuals who met the eligibility criteria (n=425) were sent a packet of four questionnaires to assess socio-
demographic data, medical history, presence of an eating disorder, and current dietary intake to rule out that the
person was following a vegetarian diet. Individuals who remained eligible (n=298) were invited to an information

fromtwopreviousweightlossstudies[29,30].Thesedatarevealedthat29%to34%ofthesubjectswouldselectthe
vegetarianoption.Therefore,weprojectedthattheratioofsubjectswhowouldprefertheSBTtotheSBT+LOVwould
be about 2:1. To ensure that an adequate number of subjects who preferred SBT+LOV would be in the Treatment
Preference-Yes group, we randomized subjects to Treatment Preference-Yes vs. Treatment Preference-No in a 3:2
ratio.
Because participants in the Treatment Preference-Yes group could choose between the SBTand the SBT+LOV,
we designed a two-stage randomization scheme (refer to Fig. 3). First, subjects were randomized to Treatment
Preference-Yes or Treatment Preference-No with a 3:2 probability. In the next stage, subjects in the Treatment
Preference-No group were randomized evenly to either the SBT or the SBT+LOV conditions. Subjects in the
TreatmentPreference-Yesgroupwerenotrandomizedbutweretreatedaccordingtothepreferencetheyindicatedon
theformattheorientationsession.AllsubjectswhopreferredtheSBT+LOVconditionwereassignedtothatgroup.
However, those who chose the SBT had to go through a random selection process with 50% probability of being
included in the study. This was done to obtain a fair balance in size across the four groups. Because more subjects
preferred the standard diet than the LOV diet, 15 subjects were discarded to prevent the Treatment Preference-Yes
SBT group from being significantly larger than the Treatment Preference-Yes SBT+LOV group. We counseled
individuals at each stage of screening that being discarded might occur but never disclosed why it would since that
mightinfluencetheirstatedpreferredchoice.Thediscardedindividualswerecompensatedfortheirtimeandreferred

permuted blocks) and stratified subjects on gender, race, and preference.

Thestrategiesarebasedonseveralmodelsofmotivationandbehavioralchange,suchassocialcognitivetheory
Goal setting: Teach participants the importance of setting goals for behaviorchange, which can lead to enhancement of motivation. They are
instructedtosetdailyandweeklygoalsforcalorieandfatconsumption,exercisetime,andbehaviorchange,e.g.,toeatbreakfastdaily,alterthe

Self-reinforcement: Occurs as the evaluation process is completed, comes from seeing personal change occur. As individuals observe their
behavior change, they develop a strengthened sense of efficacy for maintaining those behaviors [48]. Thus, self-efficacy influences
maintenance and self-regulation [49].
Feedback: Setting specific, daily goals and evaluating one’s performance in achieving these goals, as well as receiving reinforcement on
performance.Subjectsaretaughttousetheinformationrecordedintheirdiariesasasourceoffeedbackontheirprogressinchangingtheir

Stimulus control: Refers to behavioral strategies designed to help participants to alter their environment, minimize cues that might trigger
undesirable behaviors related to physical activity or eating, and add cues to increase activity [7]. Participants are taught to rearrange their
environmentforthispurpose,e.g.,removecounterproductiveitemsfromsight.
Problem solving: Participants learn skills to deal with situations that interfere with achieving their goals. Problem solving consists of 5 steps:
identifyinganddefiningtheproblem;brainstormingsolutions;evaluatingtheprosandconsofpotentialsolution;implementingthesolutionplan;
andevaluatingitssuccess[50].

measures are routinely collected and reviewed for safety monitoring, e.g., lipid profile, insulin, glucose and blood
pressure. Results are reviewed by the PI and shared with the DSMO, a physician specialized in endocrinology with
extensive experience in weight management. If any of these parameters are elevated, the participant is advised to
inform his or her physician. All participants are provided a written report of the biological and physical measure

9. Preliminary results
9.1. Sample-baseline description
As of February 2004, when recruitment was closed, 200 individuals had been randomized to the PREFER study.
From that sample, 15 were discarded in order to maintain a balance between the treatment groups (SBT and
SBT+LOV) and three subjects were withdrawn because they no longer met the inclusion criteria (2 diagnosed
withdiabetes,1becamepregnant).Therewerenosignificantdifferencesinthesociodemographicvariablesincluding

of BMI among those who were screened was 21.09 to 69.32, demonstrating the wide range in body weight among
those seeking weight loss treatments. The four treatment groups were compared in terms of baseline characteristics,
and the results showed that there were no significant differences across the four treatment groups. Therefore,
descriptive statistics were reported for the entire sample, combining the four treatment groups, as listed in Table 5.
10. Issues encountered and how managed
10.1. Adverse events
Two participants developed cholelithiasis, the first one presented with acute symptoms at the 38th week of the
intervention (following a 43 lb weight loss) and required hospitalization and surgical treatment. The second
participant did not require acute treatment. The usual procedures for handling an adverse event were followed and
theInstitutionalReviewBoardrequiredtwoactions:aletterinformingparticipantsoftheincreasedriskforgallstones
thatisassociatedwithweightlossthatparticipantsneededtosignandreturn,andaninformationsessionontheriskof
developing gallstones associated with being overweight and subsequent weight loss. It should be noted that the
moderate dietary restrictions in place in this study helped reduce the risk of cholelithiasis.
10.2. Adherence to the treatment protocol
Although the frequency of treatment sessions is weekly for the first 24 weeks, we observed that self-monitoring
andattendanceatthetreatmentsessionsbegantodeclineovertimeandalsovariedacrossthefourgroups.Adherence
to self-monitoring for the first three weeks by the full sample by treatment groups was 80% for the SBT group and
85% for the SBT+LOV group who received their preferred treatment group; for those who did not receive their
preferredgroup, theadherencefor SBTgroup was 86%and for theSBT+LOV group 84%.Attendance for thefirst
cohort’s four treatment groups at 16 weeks and at 25 weeks was as follows: Preference-Yes SBT 60% and 60%,
SBT+LOV 45% and 33%; Preference-No SBT 82% and 65%, SBT+LOV 81% and 60%, at 16 and 25 weeks,
respectively. Preliminary data analysis suggest there is no difference in adherence to the protocol by treatment
preference groups. To reduce absenteeism, participants who miss a session are contacted by one of the interven-
tionists; if the participant declines to come in for a weight and obtain the handout materials from the session, the
materialsaremailedtotheparticipant.Ifaparticipantmissestwoconsecutivesessions,aletterissentofferingacatch-
up session and the individual is encouraged to resume attending the sessions. Once the frequency of the sessions is
reduced to every two weeks, reminder phone calls are made to the participants the day before the session; when the
sessions aremonthly, areminder letter issenttheweek before andareminder phone callismade theday beforethe
session. Even though completion of a 5-day food and physical activity diary are part of the screening and run-in
period prior to enrollment, we have observed that adherence to self-monitoring begins to decline immediately, with
adherencerangingfrom53%at16weeksto33%at24weeks.Weencourageparticipantstoself-monitorregularlyso

Participants were introduced to the LOV diet over the first six weeks beginning with a meatless breakfast and
progressing to lunch and then dinner. A dietitian who is a vegetarian participated in four sessions and helped
participantslearnhowtoadapttothisdietandhowtomake adjustmentsfor afamilythatdidnotwishtofollowthe
sameeatingplan.Aftersixweeks,participantswereexpectedtofollowadietthatexcludedmeat,fish,andpoultry.At
24 weeks, participants reported consuming, on average, 0.44 servings of meat, fish or poultry per week.
10.3. Retention
The duration of the PREFER study makes retention a challenge. To maintain contact throughout the 18-month
period,wesendabirthdaycardtoallparticipantsandholidaycardsinDecember.Approximatelytwomonthspriorto
the 18-month assessment, a letter is sent to the participants toremind them of the upcoming final assessment and to
remind them of the importance of their completing the study regardless of how they feel they have done during the
study, that their data are crucial to the successful outcome of the study. There is a common misperception among
weight loss studyparticipants that ifthey haveregainedany weight thatthey arebruining thestudyQif they come in
46 L.E.Burkeetal./ContemporaryClinicalTrials27(2006)34–48
for the assessment, so this letter attempts to dispel that myth. We are flexible in scheduling the follow-up
appointments for time of day and day of week. We also compensate participants $50.00 for each assessment.
Such financial incentives consistently have been shown to improve treatment compliance [38]. Using this approach

11. Discussion
ThePREFERstudyisasinglecenterstudy,andtothebestofourknowledge,itisthefirstrandomizedcontrolled
trial examining a lacto-ovo-vegetarian eating plan as part of a weight loss study. The sample includes males and
females, adults across a wide BMI range (27 to 43), and has a 30% representation of minority groups. A limitation
includes the small percent of males (12.6%), which may have been affected by the potential to be assigned to the
lacto-ovo-vegetarian group, although this sample includes more males than is generally reported in weight loss
studies. Males do not respond to weight loss studies in largenumbers so a more concerted effort is needed to enroll
moremeninthefuture.Althoughwehavemaintainedanacceptableretentionratesofar,thesix-monthmaintenance

The design used in this weight loss treatment study represents the current state of science in standard behavioral
weightlosstreatment.Moststudieshavean18-monthto24-monthdurationwithgrouptreatmentsessionsthatbegin
at one-week intervals and are reduced over time to monthly intervals followed by a maintenance phase. The only
major difference between the standard study design and the current study is the use of treatment preference and the
restriction placed on meat, fish, and poultry consumption.
Theliteraturesupportedtheuseofbothtreatmentpreferenceandavegetariandietaspotentialstrategiestoimprove
adherence. However, the literature supporting longer-term acceptance of a vegetarian diet includes primarily cross-
sectional studies that rely on subject self-report [21,22]. In a recent report by Barnard et al. of a 14-week study that
randomlyassignedparticipantstoeitheralow-fatvegandietortoafat-modifieddietthatincludedmeat,participants
reportedthatthevegandietwaseasiertofollowthantheirusualdietandthattheycouldcontinuewiththevegandiet
atleastmostofthetimeinthefuture;thesubjectsinthelow-fatmeatcontainingdietthoughtthatcontinuationofthat
diet would be more difficult to continue than their baseline diet [28].
Itisdifficulttocompareadherenceacrossmoststudiesandweightstudiesarenodifferent.First,fewstudiesreport
adherence and many define and measure it differently. Those that do report adherence often report it only for the
specific component of the standard behavioral treatment that was being manipulated. We found six studies that
reported adherence to weight management programs. None reported on adherence to self-monitoring, and only one
reportedadherencetodiet(fatintake)[39].Threereportedonadherencetophysicalactivityprescription,[40–42]two
onattendance,[40,43]andfiveonretentionatvaryingpointsthatrangedfrom24weeksto30months[40–44].Our
retention rates fall within the range of retention rates reported in the literature, while our attendance rates are
somewhat lower than the two reports we identified.
As noted above, adherence to the treatment protocol continues to be a challenge, especially for the long-term.
Self-monitoring is one of the core components of the behavioral intervention but adherence to this strategy began
to decline early in the study. Observation of this decline prompted the PI to obtain additional funding for an
ancillary study that is being conducted with participants in the third cohort to examine in detail the patterns of
participants’self-monitoring patterns and to explore in depth with the participants, after the completion of the trial,
their feelings about adherence to the protocol. The design and methods of this ancillary study are described in an
accompanying paper [45].
Insummary,wehavelearnedseverallessonsfromthistrial.Participantsneedtobeinformedpriortostudyentryof
theriskofdevelopinggallstonesaspartofaweightlossprogram,amoreconcertedeffortneedstobemadetorecruit
men, and ongoing contact with participants is more consistent with the chronic disease model and should reduce
attrition during the last six months of the study. The PREFER study has the potential to make a substantial
contribution to understanding the role of treatment preference in long-term adherence to a study protocol as well
as the potential of a diet that eliminates meat, fish, and poultry for long-term weight loss. Further work needs to be
done to improve adherence to self-monitoring.
