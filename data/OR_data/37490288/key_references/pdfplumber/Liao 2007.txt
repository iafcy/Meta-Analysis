Abstract Objective: This study investigated the effects of a soy-based low-calorie diet on weight control,
bodycomposition,andbloodlipidprofilescomparedwithatraditionallow-caloriediet.
Methods: Thirty obese adults (mean body mass index 29–30 kg/m2) were randomized to two
groups.Thesoy-basedlow-caloriegroupconsumedsoyproteinastheonlyproteinsource,andthe
traditionallow-caloriegroupconsumedtwo-thirdsanimalproteinandtherestplantproteinina1200
kcal/d diet for 8 wk. A diet record was kept everyday throughout the study. Food intake was
analyzedbeforeandafterthestudy.Anthropometricdatawereacquiredeveryweek,andbiochem-
icaldatafrombeforeandafterthe8-wkexperimentwerecompared.
Results: Bodyweight,bodymassindex,bodyfatpercentage,andwaistcircumferencesignificantly
decreasedinbothgroups(P(cid:1)0.05).Thedecreaseinbodyfatpercentageinthesoygroup(2.2%,
95% confidence interval 1.6–2.8) was greater than that in the traditional group (1.4%, 95%
confidence interval (cid:2)0.1 to 2.8). Serum total cholesterol concentrations, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterolconcentrations,andliverfunctionparametersdecreasedinthesoy-basedgroupandwere
