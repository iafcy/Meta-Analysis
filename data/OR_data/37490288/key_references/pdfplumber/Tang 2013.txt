Normal vs. High-Protein Weight Loss Diets
in Men: Effects on Body Composition and
Indices of Metabolic Syndrome
Minghua Tang1, Cheryl L.H. Armstrong1, Heather J. Leidy2 and Wayne W. Campbell1
Objective: This study assessed the effectiveness of a prescribed weight-loss diet with 0.8 versus 1.4 g
protein(cid:1)kg(cid:2)1 day(cid:2)1 on changes in weight, body composition, indices of metabolic syndrome, and resting
energy expenditure (REE) in overweight and obese men.
Design and Methods: Menwererandomizedtogroupsthatconsumeddietscontaining750kcalday(cid:2)1less

25:50:25 percent energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively. Assessments were made pre and
postintervention.Thesubjectswereretrospectivelysubgroupedintooverweightandobesegroups.
Results and Conclusion: Both diet groups lost comparable body weight and fat. The HP group lost less
lean body mass than the NP group ((cid:2)1.9 6 0.3 vs. (cid:2)3.0 6 0.4 kg). The effects of protein and BMI status
on lean body mass loss were additive. The reductions in total cholesterol, HDL-C, triacylglycerol,
glucose, and insulin, along with LDL-C, total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio, and HOMA-IR, were not
statistically different between NP and HP. Likewise, macronutrient distributions of the diet did not affect the
reductions in REE, and blood pressure. In conclusion, energy restriction effectively improves multiple
clinical indicators of cardiovascular health and glucose control, and consumption of a higher-protein diet
and accomplishing weight loss when overweight versus obese help men preserve lean body mass over a
short period of time.
