BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Thereis littlerandomised evidenceusing a wholefood plant-based (WFPB) dietasintervention for
elevatedbody massindex (BMI)or dyslipidaemia.We investigated theeffectivenessof acommunity-based dietaryprogramme.
Primaryendpoints: BMIand cholesterol at6 months(subsequently extended).
SUBJECTS:Ages35–70,fromonegeneralpracticeinGisborne,NewZealand.Diagnosedwithobesityoroverweightandatleast
oneoftype2diabetes,ischaemicheartdisease,hypertensionorhypercholesterolaemia.Of65subjectsrandomised(controln=32,
interventionn=33),49(75.4%)completedthestudyto6months.Twenty-three(70%)interventionparticipantswerefollowedupat
12months.
METHODS:Allparticipantsreceivednormalcare.Interventionparticipantsattendedfacilitatedmeetingstwice-weeklyfor12weeks,
andfollowed a non-energy-restricted WFPB dietwithvitamin B supplementation.

RESULTS:At 6months, meanBMI reductionwas greater withthe WFPBdietcompared withnormal care(4.4 vs0.4, difference:
3.9kgm−2(95% confidence interval(CI)±1),Po0.0001). Meancholesterol reductionwas greater withtheWFPB diet,but the
differencewasnot significant compared withnormal care(0.71 vs0.26,difference: 0.45mmoll−1 (95%CI±0.54), P=0.1), unless
dropouts wereexcluded (difference: 0.56mmoll−1 (95% CI±0.54), P=0.05). Twelve-monthmean reductions fortheWFPB diet
groupwere4.2(±0.8) kgm−2 BMIpointsand 0.55(±0.54, P=0.05)mmoll−1 totalcholesterol. Noserious harmswerereported.
CONCLUSIONS:Thisprogramme ledtosignificant improvements inBMI, cholesterol and other riskfactors. To thebest ofour
knowledge,thisresearchhasachievedgreaterweightlossat6and12monthsthananyothertrialthatdoesnotlimitenergyintake
