Background-—Dietary interventions may play a role in secondary cardiovascular prevention. hsCRP (High-sensitivity C-reactive
protein) is a marker of risk for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease.
MethodsandResults-—Theopen-label,blindedend-point,EVADECAD(EffectsofaVeganVersustheAmericanHeartAssociation-

veganorAmericanHeart Association–recommendeddietwithprovisionofgroceries,tools tomeasuredietary intake,and dietary
counseling. The primary end point was high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A linear regression model compared end points after
8 weeksofaveganversusAmericanHeartAssociationdietandadjustedforbaselineconcentrationoftheendpoint.Significance
levels for the primary and secondary end points were set at 0.05 and 0.0015, respectively. A vegan diet resulted in a significant
32% lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (b, 0.68, 95% confidence interval [0.49–0.94]; P=0.02) when compared with the
American Heart Association diet. Results were consistent after adjustment for age, race, baseline waist circumference, diabetes
mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction (adjusted b, 0.67 [0.47–0.94], P=0.02). The degree ofreduction in body mass index and
waist circumferencedid not significantlydiffer between the2dietgroups(adjusted b,0.99[0.97–1.00], P=0.10;and adjusted b,
1.00 [0.98–1.01], P=0.66, respectively). There were also no significant differences in markers of glycemic control between the 2
diet groups. There was a nonsignificant 13% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the vegan diet when compared
with the American Heart Association diet (adjusted b, 0.87 [0.78–0.97], P=0.01). There were no significant differences in other
lipid parameters.
Conclusions-—In patients with coronary artery disease on guideline-directed medical therapy, a vegan diet may be considered to
lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a risk marker of adverse outcomes.

DietandInflammationinCoronaryDisease Shahetal
Other dietary components such as carbohydrate intake
may provide important context for the findings in the current
study. A recent interim analysis from the international PURE
(Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, a prospective
observational cohort study, which did not include the United
States, evaluated 135 335 participants and demonstrated a
greater likelihood of all-cause mortality in participants who
ate the most carbohydrates (average 77% of energy intake)
versus those who ate the least (average 46% of energy
intake).37 In the current study, although there was a
significantly higher carbohydrate intake in the vegan group,
