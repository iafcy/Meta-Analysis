A dietary intervention for chronic diabetic neuropathy
pain: a randomized controlled pilot study
AEBunner1,CL Wells1, JGonzales1, UAgarwal2,E Bayat3 and NDBarnard1,4
BACKGROUND:Diabetic neuropathyis acommon and often debilitating condition forwhich availabletreatments arelimited.
Becausealow-fat plant-based diethasbeenshown to improveglycemic control inindividualswith type 2diabetes, we
hypothesizedthat such adietwould reducepainful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.
METHODS:Inthis20-weekpilotstudy,individualswithtype2diabetesandpainfuldiabeticneuropathywererandomlyassignedto
twogroups.Theinterventiongroupwasaskedtofollowalow-fat,plant-baseddiet,withweeklyclassesforsupportinfollowingthe
prescribeddiet,andtotakeavitaminB12supplement.ThecontrolgroupwasaskedtotakethesamevitaminB12supplement,but
receivedno other intervention. Atbaseline,midpoint and 20weeks,clinical, laboratory and questionnairedata werecollected.
Questionnairesincluded an analog ‘worst pain’scale,Michigan Neuropathy ScreeningInstrument, global impression scale, Short
FormMcGillPainQuestionnaire,NeuropathyTotalSymptomScore,aweeklypaindiaryandNorfolkQualityofLifeQuestionnaire.
RESULTS:After 20weeks,body weightchangewiththe interventionwas −6.4kg(95% confidence interval(CI) −9.4to −3.4,
Po0.001)in aneffect sizeanalysis. Electrochemical skin conductance inthefoot improved by anaverage of12.4microseimens
(95%CI 1.2–23.6,P=0.03)with theintervention inan effect sizeanalysis. Thebetween-group differencein changeinpain,as
measuredby theMcGillpainquestionnaire, was−8.2points (95%CI −16.1to −0.3, P=0.04). Michigan Neuropathy Screening
Instrumentquestionnaire score changewas−1.6points (95%CI −3.0 to−0.2, P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS:Improvements wereseen insome clinical andpainmeasures. Thispilot study suggests thepotential valueof a
plant-based dietintervention, includingweekly support classes,for treatingpainful diabetic neuropathy.
