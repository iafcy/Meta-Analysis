foods. The portion-controlled plan included energy intake limits for weight loss (typically
a deficit of 500 calories/day) and provided guidance on portion sizes.
###### Main outcome measures Body weight, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), plasma lipids, urinary albumin, and blood pressure were measured.
###### Statistical analyses performed For normally distributed data, t tests were used; for
skewed outcomes, rank-based approaches were implemented (Wilcoxon signed-rank
test for within-group changes, Wilcoxon two-sample test for between-group comparisons, and exact Hodges-Lehmann estimation to estimate effect sizes).
###### Results Although participants were in generally good metabolic control at baseline,
body weight, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol improved significantly within each group,
with no significant differences between the two eating plans (weight: �6.3 kg vegan,
�4.4 kg portion-controlled, between-group P¼0.10; HbA1c, �0.40 percentage point in
both groups, P¼0.68; LDL cholesterol �11.9 mg/dL vegan, �12.7 mg/dL portioncontrolled, P¼0.89). Mean urinary albumin was normal at baseline and did not meaningfully change. Blood pressure changes were not significant.
###### Conclusions Weekly classes, integrated into a clinical practice and using either a lowfat vegan or portion-controlled eating plan, led to clinical improvements in individuals
with type 2 diabetes.

This clinical trial ascertained the effects of a simple, on-site
program of nutrition instruction for individuals with type 2
diabetes, using weekly classes in the office waiting room of a
private endocrinology practice in Washington, DC. It used, in
randomized fashion, low-fat vegan and portion-controlled
eating plans, testing the hypotheses that a vegan intervention would (1) improve glycemic control, body weight,
plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and indices of
renal function in a within-group analysis during a 20-week
intervention, and (2) do so more effectively than an intervention using a portion-controlled eating plan.

##### METHODS
The study was a 20-week nutrition intervention using a
weekly on-site class structure in an established endocrinology practice. There was no untreated group. The protocol
was approved by Ethical & Independent Review Services,
Independence, MO, a private institutional review board. All
participants gave written informed consent. The study was
[registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT01222429.](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)

##### RECRUITMENT
Individuals being treated for type 2 diabetes in a Washington,
DC, private endocrinology practice were notified by mail or
waiting-room fliers about the study. Volunteers were
screened by telephone, and those appearing to meet participation criteria were interviewed in person and invited to
complete a practice 3-day dietary record.
Inclusion criteria were (1) a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, as defined by a fasting plasma glucose concentration
�126 mg/dL on two occasions or a prior physician’s diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes with the use of hypoglycemic medications
for at least 6 months; (2) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between
6.5% and 10.5%; (3) age at least 18 years; (4) ability and
willingness to be assigned to either a low-fat, vegan, or
portion-controlled eating plan and participate in all components of the study; and (5) diabetes medications unchanged
for 1 month before volunteering for the study.
Exclusion criteria were (1) body mass index >45 (calculated as kg/m[2]); (2) alcohol consumption of more than two
drinks per day or the equivalent, episodic increased drinking
(eg, more than two drinks per day on weekends), or a history
of alcohol abuse or dependency followed by any current use;
(3) use of recreational drugs in the past 6 months; (4) pregnancy; (5) signs or symptoms of acute uncontrolled diabetes,
including but not limited to polyuria, polydipsia, blurred
vision, or uncontrolled weight loss; (6) unstable medical
status; (7) already following a low-fat, vegetarian eating
pattern; and (8) lack of English fluency.
The study was completed in two replications beginning in
2011 and 2014, respectively, to maximize recruitment. In each
replication, HbA1c concentrations were obtained, and participants were then ranked in order of HbA1c levels. Using a
computer-generated random-number table, they were
randomly assigned in sequential pairs to vegan and portioncontrolled groups. Because assignment was done simultaneously, allocation concealment was unnecessary.
Each participant in both groups met with a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) to develop an individualized eating
plan. These meetings followed a set agenda, which was


identical for all participants within each group. Thereafter,
participants in both groups were asked to follow their assigned
eating plans and attend weekly 1-hour meetings held after
hours in the office waiting room for instruction and support.
Before each meeting, all participants were weighed privately
and were made aware of their body weights. The waiting room
chairs were set in a circle that could accommodate approximately 15 participants. The timing and curricula for the two
groups were identical, except for the eating plan guidelines. All
sessions were conducted by an RDN, nurse, physician, cooking
instructor, or research staff and included information on diabetes, nutrition, meal planning, shopping, food preparation
techniques, recipes, and discussion of everyday dietary challenges, such as dining out and healthful snacking.
The vegan group was asked to follow a low-fat, lowglycemic index, vegan eating plan. According to the Academy
of Nutrition and Dietetics, vegan eating patterns meet all
nutritional requirements when appropriately planned and
accompanied by supplemental vitamin B-12.[4] The eating plan
consisted of whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits.
Animal products and added oils were excluded; no restrictions were placed on energy or carbohydrate intake. In
choosing carbohydrate-containing foods, participants were
encouraged to select those retaining their natural fiber and
having a glycemic index <70, using tables standardized to a
value of 100 for glucose. No meals were provided.
The eating plan was expected to derive approximately 10%
of energy from fat, 10% to 15% of energy from protein, and the
remainder from carbohydrates, and to provide approximately
30 to 40 g fiber per day.
The portion-controlled group participants received eating
plans following accepted principles for individualized medical nutrition therapy, including energy limits when needed
for weight loss (typically a deficit of 500 calories/day) and
guidance on portion sizes, distributing carbohydrates
throughout the day, reducing saturated fats, favoring highfiber foods, and limiting sodium.
Participants in both groups were provided with a
commercially available vitamin B-12 (100 mg) supplement
and asked to take it every other day. For both groups, alcoholic beverages were limited to one per day for women and
two per day for men.


-----

The study did not seek to separate the effects of nutritional
changes from those of group support; nor did it aim to
construct isocaloric interventions, which is not feasible in
free-living participants preparing their own meals, nor
desirable given that the portion-controlled eating plan used
energy restriction as a key weight-loss strategy and the vegan
plan permitted unlimited energy intake.
At weeks 3 and 15, an RDN made unannounced telephone
calls to each participant to administer a 24-hour food recall,
using a multi-pass approach (Nutrition Coordinating Center,
University of Minnesota). These recalls were not subjected to
statistical analysis but allowed the investigators to check for
poor adherence.
All participants were asked not to alter their exercise patterns and not to change their use of medications or nutritional supplements, except as recommended by their
personal physicians. All participants were under the care of a
single endocrinologist, who did not participate in the study
intervention or assessment and who was asked to avoid
changing medications during the study to the extent possible,
except in cases of medical necessity (eg, hypoglycemia or
hypotension). Many participants also had primary care physicians who were notified of their patients’ participation and
were also asked not to change medication regimens except as
clinically required.

##### NUTRITIONAL AND CLINICAL MEASURES
At baseline, height was measured without shoes and with the
participant’s back to a wall-mounted measuring tape, and
heels against the wall, and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm.
Because dopamine activity plays a role in appetitive
behavior and because certain D2 dopamine receptor Taq 1A
genotypes (A1A1, A1A2) have been associated with obesity,[5]

these genotypes were ascertained on all participants by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method[6] to assess
whether the genotypes were similarly distributed between
the two intervention groups.
At baseline and 20 weeks, participants were asked to
report changes in their health and medication use, and the
following determinations were made. For physiological and
laboratory measures, the determinations were made by
technicians blind to group assignment after subjects had
completed a 12-hour fast.
Dietary intake was assessed with a 3-day food record.
Participants were given instructions on estimating portion
sizes using food models, along with a sample record. Dietary
intake data were collected and analyzed by using Nutrition
Data System for Research (NDSR) software versions 2010[7]

and 2014[8] by an RDN certified by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota.
Body weight was measured in light, indoor clothing,
without shoes, to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a digital scale
(model FS0900, Befour, Inc).
Blood pressure was measured using a digital blood pressure monitor and a cuff of a size appropriate to the participant’s arm, at the level of the heart, after participants had
rested in a seated position for 5 minutes without talking or
reading. Three measurements were taken at 1-minute intervals. The first was disregarded, and the mean of the
remaining two measurements was calculated.


HbA1c, plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride
concentrations, and urinary albumin concentrations were
measured, using standard methods, at Quest Diagnostics,
Secaucus, NJ.
Medication changes for each participant were assessed
based on self-report, buttressed by chart reviews in cases
involving any question of the accuracy of self-report, and
were classified as a net increase, net decrease, mixed changes
(changes in opposing directions for two or more medications), or no change.

##### PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short
form assessed recent physical activity patterns. The method is
highly reliable; an assessment of testeretest repeatability
produced a correlation of 0.8.[9]

##### STATISTICAL PROCEDURES
A power analysis was done to determine sample sizes, based
on HbA1c changes observed in prior studies. An alpha of .05
was used to test for group differences. The sample size
needed to demonstrate a significant difference with power of
0.80 for effect size of 0.64 was estimated at 32 per group.
Expecting up to 20% attrition, we aimed to recruit 40 participants in each group, for a total of 80.
Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical variables
were calculated for each group. Categorical baseline factors
were compared between treatment groups by using the c[2]

test or Fisher’s exact test in the case of small cell counts.
Distributions of changes in clinical outcomes from baseline to
20 weeks were assessed for approximate normality. For
outcomes whose change distributions were sufficiently close
to normality, one-sample and two-sample t tests were used
to assess the significance of within-group changes and to
compare magnitudes of between-group changes, respectively. For outcomes with excessively skewed change distributions (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, urinary albumin, and
IPAQ), rank-based approaches were implemented, including
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the significance of
within-group changes, and the Wilcoxon two-sample test to
compare changes between the groups; exact HodgesLehmann estimation was used to provide an estimate of effect size for these outcomes. A two-sided alpha of .05 was
used for all statistical tests. Reported P values are not
adjusted for multiple comparisons.

##### RESULTS
Seventy-six patients inquired about the study. Of these, 27
were excluded for the following reasons: HbA1c outside the
acceptable range (n¼7), unable to attend weekly meetings
(n¼3), no longer a patient in the practice (n¼2), unwilling to
alter food habits (n¼1), failed to attend in-person interview
(n¼5), withdrew before acceptance (n¼6), and lost to followup during the evaluation process (n¼3). An additional four
volunteers failed to attend the baseline assessment. As a
result, 45 volunteers (29 in 2011 and 16 in 2014) were
accepted into the study and randomly assigned to the vegan
group (n¼21) or the portion-controlled group (n¼24). Demographic data are described in Table 1. No significant differences were found between groups. The A1 allele was

found in 44% of participants, without a significant difference
in distribution between the two groups.
Two vegan group participants and three portion-controlled
group participants failed to complete 20 weeks of study (one
moved, one withdrew, and three were lost to follow-up).
Therefore, 19 vegan group and 21 portion-controlled group
participants completed the study. Food records were
completed at baseline and 20 weeks by 19 participants in
each group.

##### Food Intake and Physical Activity
Both groups made substantial changes in eating patterns
(Table 2). According to the food records, both groups reduced
their energy intake. The vegan group increased its carbohydrate intake (þ54 g/d), and the portion-controlled group
reduced its intake of carbohydrate (�14 g/d, between-group
P¼0.0024). However, as percentages of energy, carbohydrate intake rose in both groups (vegan, 49% to 71% of energy;
portion-controlled 43% to 50% of energy P¼0 0013) The


percentage of energy from fat decreased in both groups
(vegan, 33% to 18%; portion-controlled, 39% to 30%,
P¼0.0476). The reductions in saturated fat and cholesterol
were greater in the vegan group (P¼0.0341 and P¼0.0012,
respectively). The percentage of energy from protein
decreased in the vegan group (18% to 14%) but increased in
the portion-controlled group (19% to 21%; P¼0.0004). Iron
intake increased slightly in the vegan group and decreased
slightly in the portion-controlled group; the between-group
difference did not reach statistical significance.
Although participants were asked not to alter their physical
activity levels, both groups increased their reported physical
activity (Table 3). This was especially true for the portioncontrolled group. However, variability was large, and the
difference between groups for the change in activity was not
statistically significant.

##### Clinical Changes
Body weight fell by 6.3 kg in the vegan group and 4.4 kg in
the portion-controlled group (P¼0.10, Table 3). Body mass
index decreased by 2.3 points and 1.5 points in the vegan and
portion-controlled groups, respectively (P¼ 0.075).
In the vegan group, medications for glycemic control were
reduced in four participants and mixed (medication changes
in opposite directions) in two, and medication use could not
be accurately assessed in two more. In the portion-controlled
group, medications were increased in three participants,
decreased in six, and mixed in four. This left 11 and eight
study completers with unchanged medication regimens for
glycemic control in the vegan and portion-controlled groups,
respectively. HbA1c values were highly skewed; median
HbA1c values fell 0.40 percentage points in both groups
(P¼0.68). Median fasting glucose values decreased by 16.0
mg/dL in the vegan group and 12.5 mg/dL in the portioncontrolled group (P¼0.71).
Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were low at baseline in both groups, reflecting
the use of lipid-lowering medications by most participants at
baseline. Several participants also altered their lipid-lowering
medications during the study, despite the request that they
not do so, leaving 14 vegan group and 16 portion-controlled
group study completers who did not report changes in
these medications. The laboratory failed to report an LDL
cholesterol value for one vegan group participant. LDL
cholesterol values fell significantly in both groups, with no
significant difference between groups (vegan, �11.9; portioncontrolled, �12.7; P¼0.89). Triglyceride concentrations
increased (but not significantly) in the vegan group and
decreased significantly in the portion-controlled group; the
difference between groups did not reach statistical significance (P¼0.06).
Tests of renal function were, on average, in the normal
range at baseline and showed no consequential changes
during the study. Other changes in clinical variables are reported in Table 3.

##### DISCUSSION
In this study of patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes,
a simple intervention of group instruction and support for
changes in eating patterns led to significant additional improvements in key clinical measures Both eating plans led to

improvements in body weight, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol
concentrations that were significant within each group, with
no significant differences in effectiveness between the two
regimens in this small trial. Mean HbA1c values were below
7.0% in both groups at baseline and fell an additional 0.4
percentage point in each group. Mean LDL cholesterol values
were well below 100 mg/dL at baseline, and the dietary interventions improved control further. The modest increase in
triglycerides observed in the vegan group accords with previous studies that have observed that, compared with individuals following omnivorous diets, those following
vegetarian or vegan diets have slightly lower triglyceride
concentrations in observational studies but slightly higher
triglyceride concentrations in clinical trials,[10] typically to a
degree that is not significant statistically or clinically.[11]

Previous studies have shown that group-based diabetes
self-management education reduces body weight, glycemia,
blood pressure, and medication requirements.[12] In a 4-year
trial, a group education program proved more effective in
preventing deterioration of metabolic control in individuals
with type 2 diabetes, compared with individual consultations.[13] An advantage of dietary interventions, compared
with pharmacologic treatments, is that they typically
improve several endpoints concurrently. This has been
particularly demonstrated with vegan regimens, which
improve body weight as well as or better than calorierestricted regimens when prescribed without explicit limits
on energy intake,[4] presumably because of their low energy
density. Because they contain no animal fat or cholesterol and
are typically rich in dietary fiber, vegan diets improve lipid
control [10] In the current study both groups already had good


lipid control at baseline, limiting the study’s ability to make
between-group comparisons of lipid-lowering effects. Lowfat vegan eating patterns also improve glycemic control[14]

and blood pressure,[15] reverse coronary atherosclerosis,[16]

and greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.[11]

Nonetheless, both programs tested in this intervention
study yielded significant clinical benefits.
Although both vegan and portion-controlled eating plans
have been shown to be effective at improving glycemic
control and cardiovascular risk,[17] they affect blood glucose via
somewhat different presumed mechanisms. Both cause
weight loss, which should help glycemic control, but by
reducing carbohydrate intake, the portion-controlled plan
reduces blood sugar directly, without necessarily addressing
insulin resistance.[2] The low-fat vegan plan greatly reduces fat
intake while increasing carbohydrate intake, apparently
reducing intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipid, which is
at the root of insulin resistance.[3]

The strikingly high (44%) prevalence of the DRD2 Taq1 A1
allele is similar to that reported in a previous study of individuals with type 2 diabetes and is clinically important
because of the presumed link between this allele and alcoholism, drug abuse, compulsive gambling, and obesity, suggesting that the allele is associated with dopamine-seeking
behavior.[4] A structured program of weekly classes and
weekly weigh-ins may be especially supportive in these individuals. However, small sample numbers prevented a
comparison between those with and without the A1 allele.
Because this study included volunteers who were not
confined to a metabolic ward or otherwise restricted and
took place in their doctor’s waiting room these findings can

reasonably translate into other clinical settings. The demographic characteristics of this study population—mostly
older than 60 years of age and predominantly black or
white—are similar to those of many other clinics, although
the educational level of our participants may have been
higher than for some settings.
However, this study also has important limitations.
Recruitment fell short of the numbers called for by the power
analysis, because of having exhausted the patient population
of the practice. Glycemia and plasma lipids were already well
controlled at baseline, limiting the potential for further reductions. Nonetheless, both eating plans, presented through
weeklyclass series, did indeed yield significant improvements.
The degree of support (weekly classes and weekly weighins) was greater than that typically provided in the clinical
setting. This is not a limitation to the generalizability of our
findings; rather, the simple structured and continuing support
provides an important model for clinical practices to consider.
Changes in medication use complicated the interpretation
of study findings. In a prior study by the current investigators,
most diabetic individuals treated with insulin or insulin secretagogues required medication reductions after starting
vegan eating plans to avoid recurrent hypoglycemia.[18] The
confounding effect of medication changes can be reduced by
excluding patients on insulin and insulin secretagogues and
by shortening the length of clinical trials; however, these
steps also would reduce the generalizability of the findings.
An additional limitation to studies in free-living participants is the degree of uncertainty as to the extent to which
participants have adhered to their prescribed nutrition or
medication regimens. Food records and telephone monitoring were used in an effort to minimize this problem; in
addition, the observed changes in body weight, glycemic
control, and plasma lipids provided some reassurance that
participants did indeed make substantial nutrient changes.
Although participants were asked not to alter their physical
activity, the study took place in the late winter and spring, a
time when physical activity would naturally increase. Participants in both groups increased their reported physical
activity, particularly in the portion-controlled group, which
may have influenced HbA1c or other variables. In addition,
most participants lost weight, which may have influenced
their aptitude for physical activity.
Despite these limitations, this study has demonstrated that
a simple program of instruction and support leads to significant improvements in diabetes management. It was not
adequately powered to differentiate the effects of the two
active regimens. In future studies, testing the effects of a
program of this type in a larger participant group with less
well-controlled diabetes, lipid values, or blood pressure
would be helpful. More research is also needed on the
application of nutritional interventions to the prevention of
diabetes complications.
In conclusion, a simple program of weekly classes for instruction and support, integrated into a clinical practice and


using either a low-fat vegan or portion-controlled eating plan,
led to clinical improvements. Because of the widespread and
serious nature of diabetes—a leading contributor to cardiovascular disease, blindness, amputations, and renal impairment—improvements in its management are of great value.
