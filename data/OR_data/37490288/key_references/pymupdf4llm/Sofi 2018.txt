### Low-Calorie Vegetarian Versus Mediterranean Diets for Reducing Body Weight and Improving Cardiovascular Risk Profile
##### CARDIVEG Study (Cardiovascular Prevention With Vegetarian Diet)


###### Editorial, see p XXX

 BACKGROUND: Only a few randomized dietary intervention studies that investigated the effects of lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (Vd) in clinically healthy omnivorous subjects are available.


###### METHODS: We randomly assigned to overweight omnivores with a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile a low-calorie Vd compared with a low-calorie Mediterranean diet (MD), each lasting 3 months, with a crossover design. The primary outcome was the difference in body weight, body mass index, and fat mass changes between the 2 groups. Secondary outcomes were differences in circulating cardiovascular disease risk parameters changes between the 2 groups.

 RESULTS: One hundred eighteen subjects (mean age: 51.1 years, females: 78%) were enrolled. The total participation rate at the end of the study was 84.7%. No differences between the 2 diets in body weight were observed, as reported by similar and significant reductions obtained by both Vd (‒1.88 kg) and MD (‒1.77 kg). Similar results were observed for body mass index and fat mass. In contrast, significant differences between the 2 interventions were obtained for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and vitamin B12 levels. The difference between the Vd and MD groups, in terms of end-of-diet values, was recorded at 9.10 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01), 12.70 mg/dL for triglycerides (P<0.01), and 32.32 pg/mL for vitamin B12 (P<0.01). Finally, no significant difference was found between Vd and MD interventions in oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines, except for interleukin-17, which improved only in the MD group. Forty-six participants during the Vd period and 35 during the MD period reached the target values for ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor.

 CONCLUSIONS: Both Vd and MD were effective in reducing body weight, body mass index, and fat mass, with no significant differences between them. However, Vd was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, whereas MD led to a greater reduction in triglyceride levels.

the fact that such populations are possibly more healthconscious and thus not completely representative of the
general population.[8] Moreover, few and limited randomized dietary intervention studies have investigated
the effects of a Vd in clinically healthy omnivorous participants.[9–12] Our aim was to compare, in a population
of omnivorous individuals living in a low-risk (for cardiovascular disease) European country, the effects of a
3-month period on a low-calorie Vd compared with a
low-calorie Mediterranean diet (MD) on several markers of cardiovascular disease risk. The MD is widely reported as one of the healthiest models for preventing
cardiovascular disease.[13]

###### METHODS


he lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (Vd), the most common type of vegetarian diet, entails the exclusion
of meat and fish in their fresh, preserved, and

# T

processed form; however, it allows for the consumption of eggs and dairy products.[1] In recent years, the
general population has shown considerable interest in
the Vd, as demonstrated by the progressive and constant increase in the number of individuals who began
to adopt a Vd when the cohorts of vegetarians were
limited to only selected populations.[1] This increase has
been predominantly attributed to the findings of different case-control[2,3] and prospective cohort studies[4–6] in
the last decade that focus on the health aspects of this
diet. In a recent meta-analysis carried out by our group
on >130 000 vegetarians, adherence to a Vd was found
to be associated with many health benefits, ranging
from lower levels of cardiovascular risk parameters to
a reduced risk of ischemic heart disease.[7] Nevertheless,
the medical literature in this field puts forth some unresolved questions that require further investigation.
Most of the findings that pointed to the beneficial effects of a Vd were from observational studies or studies
conducted in countries at a high risk for cardiovascular
disease (eg, the United States) or on vegetarians. This
approach allowed for the possibility of bias related to


###### Study Design
The study protocol was previously described[14] and is briefly
reported here. Clinically healthy participants (18–75 years of
age) with a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile (<5%
at 10 years according to the European Society of Cardiology)[15]
were recruited through advertisements in local media, newspapers, social media, official web pages, and websites from
the Clinical Nutrition Unit of Careggi University Hospital,
Florence, Italy, from March 2014 to June 2015. Eligibility criteria included being overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25
kg/m[2]) and the simultaneous presence of ≥1 of the following
criteria defined by the guidelines for cardiovascular disease
prevention of the European Society of Cardiology:[15] total
cholesterol levels >190 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol levels >115 mg/dL, triglyceride levels >150 mg/dL,
and glucose levels >110 but <126 mg/dL.[15] Participants were
excluded if they were taking medications for any reason, had
a serious illness or an unstable condition, were pregnant or
nursing, were participating or had participated in a weight
loss treatment program in the last 6 months, or were following or had followed a food profile that, to a certain extent,
excluded meat, poultry, or fish in the last 6 months.
The study was a randomized, open, crossover dietary trial
with 2 intervention periods, each lasting 3 months.[14] After a
2-week run-in period, which was used to assess participants’
motivation, commitment, and availability, participants were
randomly assigned to a Vd (n=60) or an MD (n=58) group.
During the run-in period, participants were asked to complete
a 3-day (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) dietary record. After
the first phase of intervention, participants crossed over to
the other dietary treatment. During the study, 5 clinical evaluations were performed: at the baseline before the start of
treatment, 1.5 months after the start of the first dietary intervention, 3 months after the start of the first dietary intervention and at the time of crossing over, 4.5 months from the
start of the study and 1.5 months from the time of crossing
over, and finally, 6 months after the start of the study and
3 months from the time of crossing over. Participants were
instructed not to alter their lifestyle and exercise habits during
the study, and no weight loss goal was given. Before enrollment, written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (SPE
15.054) of the Tuscany Region, Careggi University Hospital,

was registered at https://www.clinicaltrials.gov (Unique identifier: NCT02641834), and adhered to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki and the Data Protection Act.

###### Intervention
Interventions were delivered through face-to-face, individual counseling sessions at the Clinical Nutrition Unit of
Careggi University Hospital. Participants were provided with
a detailed, 1-week menu plan as well as tips and information on the food groups that could be included and those
that could not. Both of the diets were low-calorie in nature
and acted as dietary interventions to reduce body weight or
the risk parameters for cardiovascular disease. The Vd plan
included recipes for preparing meals. Both diets were hypocaloric with respect to the energy requirements of the participants, but completely isocaloric between them, and consisted
of ≈50% to 55% of energy from carbohydrate, 25% to 30%
from total fat (≤7% of energy from saturated fat, <200 mg/d
of cholesterol), and 15% to 20% from protein. The Vd was
characterized by abstinence from the consumption of meat
and meat products, poultry, fish, and seafood, and the flesh
of any other animal. It included eggs and dairy products, as
well as all the other food groups. The MD was characterized
by the consumption of all the food groups, including meat
and meat products, poultry, and fish. The dietary profiles, in
terms of servings per week, calculated on the basis of the
portion sizes recommended by the Italian Recommended
Dietary Allowances,[16] are shown in Table I in the online-only
Data Supplement. There were no substantial differences in
the frequency of servings per week for cereals, fruits and vegetables, potatoes, sweets, and olive oil. As expected, in the
case of Vd, a higher frequency of consumption, per week,
of legumes (5 versus 2.5 servings), nuts (2 versus 1), eggs (2
versus 1), and dairy products (21.5 versus 18.5) was reported
compared to MD.


dietary record analyzed using a nutrition-specific database.
Body weight and body composition were measured at each
clinical evaluation. Weight and height were measured using
a stadiometer. BMI was calculated as the weight (kg)/height
(m[2]). Participants were classified as overweight if their BMI
was ≥25 kg/m[2] but <30 kg/m[2] and obese if their BMI was ≥30
kg/m[2]. Body composition was determined by a bioelectrical
impedance analysis device (TANITA, model TBF-410).

###### Compliance
Compliance to the Vd was evaluated through unannounced
telephone calls, during which a 24-hour diet recall interview was conducted, and through a modified version of the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey food questionnaire, with the aim of confirming the total absence of any
animal flesh in the diet.[17] Adherence to the Vd was defined as
the absence of the consumption of any animal flesh, reported
through both a 24-hour diet recall and a food frequency
questionnaire. Compliance to the MD was evaluated at baseline and during follow-up visits using the MD adherence score
recently released and validated by our group.[18] Participants in
the MD group were considered adherent if they reported ≥10
points in a scale ranging from 0 to 18.


###### Data Collection
Data-collection and follow-up measurements were performed
at the Clinical Nutrition Unit of Careggi University Hospital. All
the participants were examined between 6:30 am and 9:30 am
after an overnight fast. Participants were asked not to undertake strenuous physical activity on the day before the examination. The baseline assessment for both groups included a
questionnaire on demographic information, risk factors, and
comorbidities. All participants were asked to report the frequency (times per week), duration (months), and intensity of
recreational and physical activities performed during the preceding year.
A physical activity grade was derived for each participant
based on frequency, type, and duration of the physical activity and described in terms such as absent or light (ie, inactive
or either occasional walking or recreational activity only) and
moderate (ie, frequent recreational activity, regular walking
for 30 minutes 3–5 times per week, or sporting exercise at
least once a week). The grade was not a measure of the total
time spent in physical activity; it was a relative qualitative
measure of how much physical activity was undertaken.
In addition, before the start of the intervention, each participant completed a 3-day (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day)


###### Outcomes
The primary outcomes were differences in changes in total
body weight, BMI, and fat mass from the baseline, whereas
the secondary outcomes were differences in changes in all the
circulating cardiovascular risk parameters from baseline (lipid
profile, glycemic profile, oxidative stress profile, and inflammatory profile).

###### Laboratory Measurements
Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and the
end of each intervention phase in evacuated plastic tubes
(Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson). Samples were centrifuged
at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes (4°C) and stored in aliquots at
80°C until further analyses. Total cholesterol and its subtypes,
triglycerides, glucose, insulin, serum electrolytes, standard
liver panel enzymes, and mineral and vitamin profiles were
measured according to conventional laboratory standard
methods. To assess the plasma oxidative stress profile, lipid
peroxidation markers were estimated using the Thiobarbituric
Acid Reactive Substances assay kit (Oxitek-ZeptoMetrix Corp,
Buffalo, NY). Plasma total antioxidant capacity, which represents the overall antioxidant defense system, was measured
using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity.[19] The production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes (lymphocytes,
monocytes, and granulocytes) was measured as previously
reported.[20] Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were determined by a Bio-Plex cytokine assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.


###### Statistical Analysis
The sample size was determined based on studies previously
conducted to verify the effectiveness of vegetarian-like diets
on participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.[14] We estimated
that the randomization of a population size of 110 to 125


-----

participants would be required (a sample size of ≥50 in each
group of the study) to obtain 80% power to detect an effect
size between 1.25 and 2.1 at an α level of 0.05. This calculation was based on conservative estimates of a 10% to 25%
dropout rate.
The results were expressed as mean±SD, median and
range, or geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented in
terms of frequencies and percentages. All data were treated
as paired samples from a crossover study. The 2 interventions
were analyzed combining the results obtained in the 2 phases
of both groups. The results were analyzed within each group
using a 2-tailed Student’s t test. Absolute change (mean baseline value subtracted from mean value after intervention) was
estimated by an independent sample _t test. The Spearman_
(r) test was used to estimate the correlation between the
changes in the vitamin B12 and interleukin-6 levels.
To compare the effect of the 2 different diets, a general
linear model, adjusted for the order of treatment and weight
change (for biochemical, oxidative, and inflammatory parameters), was conducted. Because these tests assume normal
data distribution, nondistributed data were transformed into
logs, and further analyses were performed with the processed
data. However, to facilitate interpretation, the log data were
again converted to the original scale (antilog) and presented
as geometric means with 95% CIs.
The possibility of a dietary carryover effect, which is considered if the impact of the first treatment is still present when
the participant enters the second treatment period, was analyzed. We evaluated the sequence effect to confirm whether
the impacts of the Vd and MD were different when the order
of administration changed. This effect was estimated by comparing the geometric mean change difference between the
treatments in the Vd and MD groups after adjustment for the
order of treatment.
Subgroup analyses were performed to analyze possible
differences in the changes according to some characteristics of the study population, such as age (≤50 years, >50
years), sex (females, males), categories of BMI (25–29.9 kg/
m[2], ≥30 kg/m[2]), obesity status (class I, 30–34.9 kg/m[2]; class II,
35–39.9 kg/m[2]; class III, ≥40 kg/m[2]), years of education (≤13
years, >13 years), physical activity (absent or light/moderate), civil status (married, not married), total cholesterol level
(≤190 mg/dL, >190 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol level (≤115 mg/
dL, >115 mg/dL), triglycerides level (≤150 mg/dL, >150 mg/
dL), and glucose level (<110 mg/dL, 110–126 mg/dL). P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Outcomes ​
were analyzed through on-treatment procedures. The statistical package PASW 20.0 for Macintosh (SPSS Inc) was used.

###### RESULTS


graphic and clinical characteristics of the population
studied, according to the first dietary randomization,
are shown in Table 1. No significant differences in the
characteristics between the 2 groups, at randomization, were observed.

###### Dietary Intake


Through the analyses of the dietary profile at the end of
the first intervention phase, we found that the total energy, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intakes of
the participants significantly decreased compared with
baseline (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement).
However, no significant differences in the proportions
of decrease were observed between the groups, apart
from cholesterol intake, which, as expected, decreased
more in the Vd group (‒105.6 versus ‒49.7 mg/d;
_P=0.001). The protein intake increased in the MD group_
(+1.4%) and decreased in the Vd group (‒1.5%), leading to a significant difference between the groups
(P=0.001).

###### Body Weight and Body Composition


Figure 2 shows the changes in the anthropometric parameters at the end of the study after combining data
from both intervention periods. No significant difference between the 2 diets was found because both the
Vd and MD produced equally effective results, with the
difference between the Vd and MD groups, in terms
of end-of-diet values, being recorded at 0.11 kg for
weight (P=0.95), 0.03 kg/m[2] for BMI (P=0.84), and 0.23
kg for fat mass (P=0.50). With regard to the change
within each group, a significant body weight reduction
of ‒1.88 kg (95% CI, ‒2.42 to ‒1.35) and ‒1.77 kg
(95% CI, ‒2.29 to ‒1.25) with a significant BMI reduction of ‒0.64 kg/m[2] (95% CI, ‒0.84 to ‒0.43) and
‒0.67 kg/m[2] (95% CI, ‒0.86 to ‒0.47), and a significant fat mass reduction of ‒1.23 kg (95% CI, ‒1.67 to
‒0.80) and ‒1.46 kg (95% CI, ‒1.93 to ‒1.01) were
reported in the Vd and MD groups, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in the
changes of all the anthropometric parameters.

###### Biochemical Profile


###### Participants’ Characteristics

Figure 1 shows the enrollment of participants in the
study. A total of 107 participants completed ≥1 phase
of intervention and were included in the analysis. One
hundred participants (50 participants for each intervention) completed the entire study, with a participation
rate of 84.7% at the conclusion. The baseline demo

The changes in the biochemical parameters, including
hematologic variables, vitamins, iron status, minerals,
liver function, uric acid, and lipid and glycemic profiles,
are shown in Table 2. The diets displayed significant
differences in terms of end-of-diet values, LDL cholesterol (9.10 mg/dL; P=0.01), triglycerides (12.70 mg/dL;
_P<0.01), vitamin B12 (32.32 pg/mL;_ _P<0.01), and uric_
acid levels (0.22 mg/dL; P<0.01). Although the Vd resulted in a significant decrease (‒5.44%) in LDL cholesterol levels, no significant change was observed after


-----

the MD period. The MD resulted in a significant decrease
(‒5.91%) in triglyceride levels compared with the VD,
which showed an increasing trend despite it not being
significant. For vitamin B12, a significant decrease after
the Vd (‒5.06%) and a nonsignificant increasing trend
after the MD were reported. Finally, in the case of the
Vd, a significant reduction in uric acid levels (‒2.89%)
was noted; nonsignificant changes were reported during the MD.
Subgroup analyses showed that changes in the lipid
profile during the Vd were more evident in men, in participants >50 years of age, in nonsmokers, in participants with sedentary lifestyles, and in participants with
a BMI >30 kg/m[2], with the most significant results in
participants with class I obesity (Table III in the onlineonly Data Supplement). The change in the vitamin B12
levels after the Vd phase was more apparent among
overweight participants (especially among participants
with class I obesity), men, and participants <50 years of
age (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).

###### Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Profiles


derived reactive oxygen species showed decreasing but
nonsignificant trends.
With regard to the inflammatory profile, a significant
difference between the diets was observed in the case
of interleukin-17 levels (3.39 pg/mL; _P<0.01). Indeed,_
interleukin-17 displayed opposite tendencies during the
2 phases of intervention, as evidenced by an increasing
trend (by 37.57%) in the Vd phase and a significant
decreasing trend (by 36.3%) in the MD phase (Table 4).
Overall, the Vd resulted in a reduction in the levels of 8
out of 13 cytokines, and in the case of 6, statistical significance was reached. The MD resulted in a reduction
in the levels of 11 out of 13 pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines, and in the case of 7, statistical significance
was reached.
Carryover effects were not detected for all the parameters investigated.

###### Compliance


Changes in the oxidative stress profile are reported in
Table 3. No difference between the diets was observed.
Although both diets led to a similar and significant reduction in the Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances
levels, only the Vd resulted in a significant reduction
in the leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species level
(‒8.42%). Total antioxidant capacity and M- and G

During the study, 18 (15.3%) participants reported
a less-than-optimal compliance to the prescribed diets and were excluded at different time points from
the study (Figure 1). The comparison of baseline
characteristics between participants who completed
the study and those who were excluded for not being adherent showed significant differences in age,
BMI, and physical activity. Participants who did not
finish the study were significantly younger (41 versus
52 years of age), had a higher BMI (33.1 versus 30.1
kg/m[2]), and had significantly more sedentary lifestyles

than the participants who completed the study (Table
IV in the online-only Data Supplement). By conducting all the analyses after the inclusion of the nonadherent participants, through an intention-to-treat
analysis, the results of both the anthropometric and
circulating biomarkers did not substantially change
(data not shown).

###### Cardiovascular Risk Profile


<25 kg/m[2]). Of these participants, during the Vd, 16
reached the target values for total cholesterol, 17 for
LDL cholesterol, 6 for triglyceride levels, and 14 for BMI.
As for the MD, only 7 subjects reached the target values
for total cholesterol, 6 for LDL cholesterol, 8 for triglyceride levels, and 10 for BMI.

###### DISCUSSION


Both diets resulted in a significant improvement of the
participants’ cardiovascular risk profile. Forty-six participants during the Vd (44.2% of the participants who

of the participants in whom the MD was initiated) modified their risk category by reaching the target values
recommended by the European Society of Cardiology[15]
for ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor (total cholesterol level
≤190 md/dL, LDL cholesterol level ≤115 mg/dL, triglyceride level ≤150 mg/dL, glucose level ≤110 mg/dL, BMI


This randomized dietary intervention trial is the first to
compare the effectiveness of a low-calorie Vd and a
similar MD in improving the cardiovascular risk profile
of a clinically healthy omnivorous population living in
a low-risk country for cardiovascular disease. The most
significant result was that, at the end of the 3-month
intervention period on a low-calorie Vd and MD, similar reductions in total body weight, BMI, and total fat
mass were observed, with no differences between the
diets. In addition, although the Vd was more effective
in reducing LDL cholesterol levels, the MD was more

In line with previously conducted studies, the
present study also shows the beneficial effect of Vd
and MD on body weight, BMI, and fat mass. A recent meta-analysis by Barnard et al[21] identified 6 trials
that analyzed a vegetarian-like period and reported
a significant reduction in total body weight, with an
average mean reduction of 3.4 kg. In the same year,
the results of an additional meta-analysis, including
12 randomized controlled trials that involved participants who followed a VD, reported similar findings,
with a mean reduction of 2.2 kg with respect to the
nonvegetarian group.[22] In our study, despite a similar
significant trend, we found a slightly lower reduction
in the body weight among the participants following
the Vd (‒1.74 kg). This difference in terms of body
weight change can be explained by the fact that the
results of previously conducted intervention studies
investigated not only VDs but also vegan diets and
other forms of vegetarianism, different study populations were analyzed, the durations of intervention
were different, and there was a lack of a comparable
diet for most studies. In the present study, the comparison diet was the MD, widely reported to be one
of the healthiest dietary models in the reduction of
the risk burden of chronic degenerative diseases.[13]
In recent decades, several intervention studies have
demonstrated the beneficial effects of a low-calorie
MD on body weight and several anthropometric measurements.[13] The present study confirms this finding
and extends the evidence of the beneficial effects of
the MD on body weight, in comparison with those
of a similar low-calorie Vd. The possible mechanisms
explaining the effects of both Vd and MD in reducing body weight and fat mass may be related to the
higher consumption of certain beneficial food groups
such as complex carbohydrates, legumes, fruits, and
vegetables. All of these food groups are rich in fiber,
and several studies have reported an inverse association between fiber consumption and weight loss via
effects on satiety, as well as fat reduction and glucose
absorption.[23] In the present study, the intervention


diets did not differ in the percentage of calories obtained from macronutrients and the main categories
of food (except for animal products and legumes) and
were isocaloric. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of a greater reduction in kilocalories in the Vd
compared to the MD.
With regard to the lipid profile, these results demonstrate the beneficial effects of both diets; in the case
of the Vd, a significant reduction in the LDL cholesterol
level was noted, whereas in the case of the MD, the
triglyceride levels were significantly reduced. A recent
meta-analysis that included 11 randomized trials, conducted on participants who followed vegetarian diets
versus those who followed control diets, reported a
significant lowering of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
but not triglyceride levels.[24] Nevertheless, literature on
the beneficial effects of VDs on triglyceride levels is
inconsistent and contrasting.[7] Some studies reported
the beneficial effects of VDs on triglyceride levels,
whereas others did not observe any significant effect.
In the present study, we confirmed the beneficial effects of the Vd in the reduction of LDL cholesterol by
extending the results to clinically healthy participants
living in a country at low risk for cardiovascular disease. However, no effects of the Vd on triglyceride and
high-density lipoprotein levels were observed. The null
effect of the Vd on triglyceride levels may be explained
by the paradoxical effects of an increased level of circulating triglyceride levels because of the high content
of carbohydrate and total fat that occurs when meat
and meat products are eliminated from the diet, as
reported by other studies.[25] In our study, the 2 diets
were not essentially different in terms of the weekly
portions consumed by these food groups, so the null
effect on triglyceride does not seem to follow this hypothesis. However, we observed a beneficial effect of
the MD on triglyceride levels as reported by intervention studies.[13]

The Vd and MD can reduce lipid parameters through
different mechanisms. The Vd is low in cholesterol, total

fat, and saturated fatty acid,[26] leading to lower intake
and thus lower rates of absorption and conversion into
cholesterol in the bloodstream.[27] In our dietary study,
the Vd administered to our study participants entailed a
significantly lower daily intake of cholesterol. The MD,
in contrast, can reduce triglyceride levels through its
beneficial components, including olive oil, dietary fiber,
and many phytonutrients.[28]

As expected, in the intervention period with the
VD, a significant reduction in vitamin B12 levels was observed. This reduction, despite being clinically irrelevant
and within the normal range, confirms that the Vd may
lead to lower levels of this vitamin, as previously reported by other studies.[29] This issue warrants further investigation because, over an extended period, a decrease in
vitamin B12 associated with Vd can lead to a deficiency
that may be clinically relevant. Indeed, the official position of scientific societies and agencies is unequivocal:
participants following VDs and vegan diets should be
screened for vitamin B12 deficiency and eventually encouraged to use fortified foodstuffs or supplements to
ensure adequate vitamin B12 intake.[30]

As for the oxidative profile, no difference between
the Vd and MD was observed. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate these parameters
after a period of intervention with the Vd, whereas several results have already been obtained for the MD.[31]
Previously conducted studies on food categories such
as wheat, fruit, and vegetables have signaled the beneficial role of nutrients in reducing the circulating levels
of reactive oxygen species,[32] but no data on the shortterm effect of VDs have yet been published.


With regard to the inflammatory parameters, this dietary intervention study is the first to include a VD and
evaluate a large pattern of pro- and anti-inflammatory
cytokines. A significant difference between the Vd and
MD was observed only for interleukin-17, which significantly increased during the Vd and significantly decreased during the MD period. Several studies in the
past reported a strict association between vitamin B12
and inflammation, possibly through the modulation of
the metabolic cycle of homocysteine.[33] In addition, a
relationship between higher levels of interleukin-6 and
lower levels of vitamin B12 has been previously reported[34] and is supported by our results because we observed an inverse and significant correlation between
changes in the interleukin-6 and vitamin B12 levels
(r=0.22; P=0.026). Thus, it can be postulated that the
Vd leads to a decrease in vitamin B12 levels and an increase in homocysteine levels, with a consequent worsening of the inflammatory profile.
The strengths of the study include the crossover design, the comparability between the 2 diets in terms
of total energy and macronutrients, the high rate of
adherence, and the various parameters analyzed in the
same group of participants at different time points.
However, some limitations are present, such as the lack
of data on blood pressure levels, the limited duration
of the study, and the limited number of participants
who completed the whole study. We are aware that 3
months of intervention is a limited period and permits
only the suggestion of the possible interpretation of the
results. Studies with a larger population and a longer
duration are needed to confirm these results. However,


-----

despite the limitations, the present study included the
largest cohort of omnivorous participants who underwent a period on a Vd.
In conclusion, in the context of the behavioral counseling that promoted a reduced caloric intake, the results of this dietary randomized intervention study, the
first comparing a Vd and MD in the same group of
clinically healthy omnivorous participants, showed no
difference in weight change between the Vd and MD
groups, but the Vd reduced LDL cholesterol levels compared with the MD, which reduced triglyceride levels
compared with the Vd.
