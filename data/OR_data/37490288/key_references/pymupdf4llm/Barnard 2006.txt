**OBJECTIVE — We sought to investigate whether a low-fat vegan diet improves glycemic**
control and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

**RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n �** 99)
were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n � 49) or a diet following the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines (n � 50). Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22
weeks.

**RESULTS — Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of the ADA**
group participants reduced diabetes medications. Including all participants, HbA1c (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P �
0.089). Excluding those who changed medications, A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan group
compared with 0.38 points in the ADA group (P � 0.01). Body weight decreased 6.5 kg in the
vegan group and 3.1 kg in the ADA group (P � 0.001). Body weight change correlated with A1C
change (r � 0.51, n � 57, P � 0.0001). Among those who did not change lipid-lowering
medications, LDL cholesterol fell 21.2% in the vegan group and 10.7% in the ADA group (P �
0.02). After adjustment for baseline values, urinary albumin reductions were greater in the vegan
group (15.9 mg/24h) than in the ADA group (10.9 mg/24 h) (P � 0.013).

**CONCLUSIONS — Both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on ADA guidelines improved**
glycemic and lipid control in type 2 diabetic patients. These improvements were greater with a
low-fat vegan diet.

used in the absence of exercise, was associated with increased insulin sensitivity
and reduced body weight in nondiabetic
overweight women (4).
We therefore conducted a randomized controlled trial of a vegan diet with
exercise held constant to test the hypothesis that, in individuals with type 2 diabetes, a low-fat plant-based diet improves
glycemic, plasma lipid, and weight control compared with a diet based on current ADA guidelines.

**RESEARCH DESIGN AND**
**METHODS — Individuals with type 2**
diabetes, defined by a fasting plasma glucose concentration �6.9 mmol/l on two
occasions or a prior diagnosis of type 2
diabetes with the use of hypoglycemic
medications for �6 months, were recruited through newspaper advertisements in the Washington, DC, area on
two occasions (October 2003 through
December 2003 and October 2004
through December 2004) to complete the
study from January 2004 through June
2004 and January 2005 through June
2005, respectively. Exclusion criteria
were an HbA1c (A1C) �6.5 or �10.5%,
use of insulin for �5 years, current smoking, alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy,
unstable medical status, and current use
of a low-fat vegetarian diet. The protocol
was approved by the George Washington
University Institutional Review Board. All
participants gave written informed
consent.
A1C was assayed using affinity chromatography on an Abbott IMx analyzer
(5). Volunteers were ranked in order of
A1C concentrations and randomly assigned in sequential pairs, using a random-number table, to a low-fat vegan diet
or a diet following the 2003 ADA guidelines (6) for 22 weeks. Because assignment was done simultaneously, allocation
concealment was unnecessary.
The vegan diet (�10% of energy from
fat, 15% protein, and 75% carbohydrate)
consisted of vegetables, fruits, grains, and
legumes. Participants were asked to avoid
animal products and added fats and to

ence was measured at the maximal protrusion of the buttocks.
Blood pressure was measured after
participants had rested in a seated position for 5 min using a digital monitor
(Omron HEM-711) and a standard cuff
maintained at the level of the heart. Three
measurements were taken at 2-min intervals; the first measurement was disregarded, and a mean was calculated for the
remaining two values.

**Statistical analyses**
To have an 80% chance of detecting a
1.5–percentage point between-group
A1C difference as significant (at the twosided 5% level), with an assumed SD of
1.9% and a loss to follow-up of 26%, 34
participants were required per group. An
interim analysis indicated group differences of 0.8% with an SD of 1.3%; therefore, a revised power analysis was
conducted. To have an 80% chance of detecting a 0.8% difference as significant
with an SD of 1.3% and loss to follow-up
of 33%, an additional 15 participants
were required per group.
Between-subject t tests were calculated for each measure to determine
whether the changes associated with the
intervention diet were greater than those
associated with the control diet. Within
each diet group, paired comparison t tests
were calculated to test whether the
change from baseline to 22 weeks was significantly different from zero. The primary analysis of the main end point was
intention to treat and included all participants. Because medication changes influence the dependent measures,
exploratory analyses were performed for
the subgroup whose medications remained constant. An � of 0.05 was used
for all statistical tests, with no adjustment
for multiple comparisons.
Regression analyses assessed whether
the diet group effects on A1C and body
weight were significant, while controlling
for baseline values, and whether the diet
group effect on A1C was significant, while
controlling for baseline A1C and changes
in body weight. Pearson correlations were
calculated for the relationship between
A1C change and weight change.
An interim analysis was performed after week 11 to assess whether benefits
or adverse outcomes were statistically
unusual.

**RESULTS — Of 1,049 individuals**
screened by telephone, 99 met participation criteria and were randomly assigned


favor low–glycemic index foods, such as
beans and green vegetables. Portion sizes,
energy intake, and carbohydrate intake
were unrestricted.
The ADA diet (15–20% protein, �7%
saturated fat, 60–70% carbohydrate and
monounsaturated fats, and cholesterol
�200 mg/day) was individualized, based
on body weight and plasma lipid concentrations (6). ADA group participants with
a BMI �25 kg/m[2] (all but three ADA
group participants) were prescribed energy intake deficits of 500–1,000 kcal.
No meals were provided. To meet the
vitamin B12 needs of the vegan group
while maintaining the same intervention
in the ADA group, all participants were
provided a vitamin B12 supplement (100
�g) to be taken every other day. For both
groups, alcoholic beverages were limited
to one per day for women and two per day
for men. Participants were asked not to
alter their exercise habits during the intervention period.
Each participant met for 1 h with a
registered dietitian experienced in the use
of the assigned diet to establish an appropriate diet plan. Thereafter, participants
attended weekly 1-h meetings of their assigned groups for nutrition and cooking
instruction conducted by a physician and
a registered dietitian and/or a cooking instructor. Sessions for the two groups were
similar in duration and content, except
with regard to dietary details. Group leaders were instructed to make no comment
favoring either diet over the other.
At weeks 4, 8, 13, and 20, a registered
dietitian made unannounced telephone
calls to each participant to administer a
24-h diet recall. These recalls were not
statistically analyzed, but allowed the investigators to check for poor adherence
and provide additional dietary counseling
as needed.
In addition, a 3-day dietary record
was completed by each participant at
weeks 0, 11, and 22, on 2 weekdays and 1
weekend day, using a food scale, after participants had completed a 3-day practice
record. Using the Nutrition Data System
for Research software version 5.0 (Food
and Nutrient Database 35 [released May
2004]; Nutrition Coordinating Center,
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis,
MN) (7), a registered dietitian certified by
the Nutrition Coordinating Center analyzed all 3-day dietary records and diet
recalls. For purposes of statistical analysis, dietary adherence for the vegan group
was defined as the absence of meat, poultry fish dairy or egg intake reported on


24-h recalls or incidentally at any point,
as saturated fat �5% and total fat �25%
of energy, and as average daily cholesterol
intake �50 mg on 3-day dietary records
at 22 weeks. Adherence for the ADA
group was defined as average daily energy
intake on the 22-week 3-day dietary
records being no more than 200 kcal in
excess of the intake prescribed by the registered dietitian and saturated fat �10%
of energy. Individuals who attended
fewer than 10 of the 22 weekly sessions
were also considered nonadherent on either diet.
Participants were asked to continue
their preexisting medication regimens,
except when fasting plasma glucose determinations fell below 4.4 mmol/l or hypoglycemic symptoms were accompanied
by a capillary glucose reading �3.6
mmol/l. In such cases, medications were
reduced for participant safety by a study
endocrinologist, who remained blind to
group assignment, following an established protocol.
Laboratory measurements were made
after a 12-h fast by technicians blind to
group assignment. A1C (the primary end
point) was assayed at 0, 11, and 22 weeks,
as described above. All other measures
were assessed at baseline and 22 weeks,
except as noted. Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method using an Abbott Spectrum analyzer (Abbott
Park, IL) (8). Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured
by enzymatic methods using an Abbott
Spectrum analyzer (9,10). HDL cholesterol was measured after double precipitation with dextran and MgCl2 (11). LDL
cholesterol was estimated using the
Friedewald equation (12). In individuals
whose plasma triglyceride concentrations
exceeded 400 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol was
measured directly by precipitation and
magnetic separation (LipiDirect; Polymedco, Cortlandt Manor, NY). Non-HDL
cholesterol concentration was calculated
as the difference between total and HDL
cholesterol. Urinary albumin was measured on 24-h samples using an anionic
dye–binding assay (13).
Physical activity was assessed over a
3-day period by pedometer (Omron HJ112) and with the Bouchard 3-Day Physical Activity Record (14). Body weight
was determined at 0, 11, and 22 weeks,
before breakfast while participants wore
hospital gowns, using a digital scale accurate to 0.1 kg. Waist circumference was
measured with a tape measure placed 2.5
cm above the umbilicus Hip circumfer

to the vegan (n � 49) or ADA (n � 50)
groups. The reasons for exclusion were
A1C values outside the required range
(n � 201), failure to meet other participation criteria (n � 279), inability to attend
scheduled meetings (n � 187), failure to
keep interview appointment (n � 153),
reluctance to change diet (n � 72), and
other or unspecified (n � 58). The participants’ demographic and clinical characteristics (Table 1) were similar to those of
individuals with type 2 diabetes in the
Washington, DC, area. All participants
completed laboratory assessments at 22
weeks.
Three vegan participants and eight
ADA participants failed to complete 22week dietary records Both groups re

duced energy intake (vegan 1,759 � 468
to 1,425 � 427 kcal/day, P � 0.0001;
ADA 1,846 � 597 to 1,391 � 382 kcal/
day, P � 0.0001 [between-group P �
0.22]) and protein intake (vegan 77 � 27
to 51 � 16 g/day, P � 0.0001; ADA 85 �
27 to 73 � 23 g/day, P � 0.002 [between
group P � 0.01]). Carbohydrate intake
increased in the vegan group from 205 �
69 to 251 � 70 g/day (P � 0.0001) but
fell in the ADA group from 213 � 70 to
165 � 51 g/day (P � 0.0001 [betweengroup P � 0.001]).
Fat intake fell in both groups (vegan
72 � 28 to 30 � 19 g/day, P � 0.0001;
ADA 73 � 35 to 52 � 21 g/day, P �
0.0001 [between-group P � 0.002]), as
did saturated fat (vegan 23 � 10 to 6 � 4


g/day, P � 0.0001; ADA 23 � 12 to 14 �
6 g/day, P � 0.0001 [between-group P �
0.001]) and cholesterol (vegan 291 �
223 to 24 � 57 mg/day, P � 0.0001; ADA
317 � 200 to 189 � 89 mg/day, P �
0.0001 [between-group P � 0.002]). Fiber increased only among vegans (18.8 �
6.4 to 36.3 � 13.3 g/day, P � 0.0001;
ADA 19.5 � 6.9 to 19.0 � 7.9 g/day, P �
0.73 [between-group P � 0.001]).
Pedometer readings and self-reported
energy expenditure revealed no significant between-group differences. Groupspecific dietary adherence criteria were
met by 67% (33 of 49) of vegan group
participants and 44% (22 of 50) of ADA
group participants. During the intervention period, 43% (21 of 49) of vegan
group participants and 26% (13 of 50) of
ADA group participants reduced their diabetes medications, mainly as necessitated by hypoglycemia, while 8% (4 of
49) of vegans and 8% (4 of 50) of ADA
participants increased medications without investigators’ authorization.
A1C fell 0.96 percentage points (P �
0.0001) in the vegan group and 0.56 percentage points (P � 0.0009) in the ADA
group (between-group P � 0.089; baseline-adjusted P � 0.091; Table 2 and Fig.
1). Among participants whose diabetes
medications remained unchanged
throughout (n � 24 vegan and n � 33
ADA), A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan
group and 0.38 points in the ADA group
(P � 0.01; baseline-adjusted P � 0.007).
Subanalyses were conducted to assess the
effects of dietary adherence. For those
who met adherence criteria (n � 33 vegan
and n � 22 ADA), the A1C changes were
�1.20% for the vegan group and
�0.88% for the ADA group (P � 0.31).
For those who were both adherent and
medication stable (n � 17 vegan and n �
12 ADA), A1C changes were �1.48% for
the vegan group and �0.81% for the ADA
group (P � 0.15).
To test whether the effect of diet on
A1C was mediated by body weight
changes, a regression model was constructed, including baseline A1C, weight
change, and diet group as predictors of
A1C change, among those whose hypoglycemic medications remained constant.
In this model, the effect of diet group was
no longer significant (P � 0.23). Controlling for diet group and for baseline A1C
scores, weight change was significantly
associated with A1C change; each kilogram of weight loss was associated with a
0.12% drop in A1C. For the subgroup
that did not change diabetes medications

the Pearson’s correlation of weight change
with A1C change was r � 0.51, P �
0.0001 (within the vegan group [n � 24],
_r �_ 0.39, P � 0.05; within the ADA group

[n � 33], r � 0.49, P � 0.004).
Body weight fell 5.8 kg in the vegan
group (P � 0.0001) and 4.3 kg in the
ADA group (P � 0.0001) (between-group
_P �_ 0.082; baseline-adjusted P � 0.066).
Among medication-stable participants,
vegan participants lost 6.5 kg compared
with 3.1 kg for ADA participants (P �
0.001; baseline-adjusted P � 0.001).
The reduction in urinary albumin was
significant in the vegan group (P � 0.002)
but not in the ADA group (P � 0.14). The
unadjusted between-group difference
was not significant. However, after adjustment for baseline values, the effect of diet
was significant (P � 0.013).
For the entire sample, there were no
between-group differences in lipid values. Among those whose lipid-controlling
medications remained constant (80% [39
of 49] of vegan group, 82% [41 of 50] of
ADA group), reductions in total cholesterol were �0.866 mmol/l (�33.5 mg/dl,
�17.6%) for the vegan group and
�0.491 mmol/l (�19.0 mg/dl, �9.7%)
for the ADA group (P � 0.0125). Changes
in LDL cholesterol were �0.58 mmol/l
(�22.6 mg/dl, �21.2%) for the vegan
group and �0.277 mmol/l (�10.7 mg/dl,
�9.3%) for the ADA group (P � 0.023).
Changes in HDL cholesterol were �0.16
mmol/l (�6.0 mg/dl, �11.0%) for the
vegan group and �0.07 mmol/l (�2.8
mg/dl, �5.7%) for the ADA group (P �
0.14). The total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio
fell for both groups, as did triglyceride
concentrations.
There were no treatment-related serious adverse events.

**CONCLUSIONS — Both diets were**
associated with significant clinical improvements, as indicated by reductions in
A1C, body weight, plasma lipid concentrations, and urinary albumin excretion.
Among medication-stable participants,
changes in A1C, weight, BMI, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and LDL
cholesterol were significantly greater in
the vegan group. The magnitude of A1C
reduction in medication-stable vegan
group participants, 1.23 percentage
points, compares favorably with that observed in single-agent therapy with oral
diabetes drugs (15).

portions can, as a result, easily exceed recommended limits on saturated fat. In contrast, the vegan diet includes no animal
fat, so variations in food quantity are less
likely to result in substantial increases in
saturated fat intake. Because the vegan
diet is based on the elimination of certain
foods, it may be easier to understand than
regimens that limit quantities of certain
foods without proscribing any. The acceptability of low-fat vegan diets in clinical studies is similar to that of seemingly
more moderate diets (27).
This study’s strengths include its
analysis of dependent measures without
regard to variations in dietary adherence
and applicability outside the research setting. A study limitation was that both diets made participants vulnerable to the
hypoglycemic effect of their diabetes
medications, resulting in medication reductions that confound the interpretation
of A1C changes and necessitating a subgroup analysis of medication-stable participants. Because these episodes
occurred early in the trial, there was no
opportunity to bring interim laboratory
values forward. Also, most study participants were taking antihypertensive medications, which may have blunted the
effect of diet on blood pressure.
In conclusion, in individuals with
type 2 diabetes participating in a 22-week
clinical trial, both a low-fat vegan diet and
a diet following ADA guidelines improved
glycemic control; however, the changes
were greater in the vegan group. Further
research is necessary to establish longerterm diet effects and sustainability.

S, Sullivan R, Browning S: Toward improved management of NIDDM: a ran

sulin sensitivity. First, because such diets
are low in fat and high in fiber, they typically cause associated reductions in dietary energy density and energy intake,
which are not fully compensated for by
increased food intake (16,17). Our data
suggest that the weight-reducing effect of
the vegan diet (4) is responsible for a substantial portion of its effect on A1C.
Independent of their effect on body
weight, reductions in total fat intake and
in the proportion of dietary saturated to
unsaturated fat increase insulin sensitivity
(18), as do increased intake of low–
glycemic index and high-fiber foods (1).
Finally, limited evidence suggests
that reductions in iron stores increase insulin sensitivity (19). A vegan diet provides iron in its nonheme form, which is
somewhat less absorbable than heme
iron. A study comparing 30 ovolactovegetarians and 30 meat eaters, all of whom
were healthy and had BMIs �23 kg/m[2],
showed that vegetarians had adequate,
but lower, body iron stores, compared
with meat eaters (serum ferritin concentration 35 �g/l [95% CI 21–49] vs. 72
�g/l [45–100]). The vegetarians also
demonstrated less insulin resistance
(steady-state plasma glucose concentration 4.1 mmol/l [3.5–5.0] vs. 6.9 mmol/l

[5.2–7.5], respectively) (19).
Insulin resistance is related to lipid
accumulation within muscle cells (intramyocellular lipid), apparently due to a
genetically based reduction in mitochondrial activity identifiable many years be

fore diabetes manifests (20). This lipid
accumulation may be responsive to diet.
High-fat diets appear to downregulate the
genes required for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle
(21). In contrast, a case-control study
found that soleus muscle intramyocellular lipid concentrations were significantly
lower in a group of 21 vegans compared
with 25 omnivores (�9.7 [95% CI �16.2
to �3.3], P � 0.01) (22).
The lipid-lowering effect of vegan diets, attributable to their absence of dietary
cholesterol, low saturated fat content, and
a specific cholesterol-reducing effect of
soluble fiber and other plant constituents
(23), is particularly important given that
cardiovascular complications are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in
diabetes. While diets high in refined carbohydrate may increase triglyceride concentrations, high-fiber and low–glycemic
index foods appear to have the opposite
result (24).
The limited compliance of the ADA
group merits comment. Researchers have
long lamented the difficulties in adhering
to diets for diabetes (25). The A1C reduction observed in the ADA group was similar to that found in previous studies (26).
A potential weakness of the ADA guidelines is that they require portion size limits for overweight individuals, and
limitations on saturated-fat intake are
based on these limited energy intakes. Individuals who exceed their prescribed energy intake limits with overly large
