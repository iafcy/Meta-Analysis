**ABSTRACT**
**Background** Although vegan diets improve diabetes management, little is known about the nutrient profiles or
diet quality of individuals with type 2 diabetes who adopt
a vegan diet.
**Objective** To assess the changes in nutrient intake and
dietary quality among participants following a low-fat
vegan diet or the 2003 American Diabetes Association
dietary recommendations.

**Design** A 22-week randomized, controlled clinical trial examining changes in nutrient intake and diet quality.
**Subjects/setting** Participants with type 2 diabetes (n�99)
in a free-living setting.
**Research design and methods** Participants were randomly
assigned to a low-fat vegan diet or a 2003 American
Diabetes Association recommended diet.
**Main outcome measures** Nutrient intake and Alternate
Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores were collected at
baseline and 22 weeks.
**Statistical analyses performed** Between-group t tests were
calculated for changes between groups and paired comparison t tests were calculated for changes within-group.
Pearson’s correlation assessed relationship of AHEI score
to hemoglobin A1c and body weight changes.
**Results** Both groups reported significant decreases in energy, protein, fat, cholesterol, vitamin D, selenium, and
sodium intakes. The vegan group also significantly reduced reported intakes of vitamin B-12 and calcium, and
significantly increased carbohydrate, fiber, total vitamin
A activity, beta carotene, vitamins K and C, folate, magnesium, and potassium. The American Diabetes Association recommended diet group also reported significant
decreases in carbohydrate and iron, but reported no significant increases. The vegan group significantly improved its AHEI score (P�0.0001), while the American
Diabetes Association recommended diet group did not
(P�0.7218). The difference in AHEI score at 22 weeks
between groups was significant (P�0.0001). With both
groups combined, AHEI score was negatively correlated
with both changes in hemoglobin A1c value (r�– 0.24,
_P�0.016) and weight (r�– 0.27,_ _P�0.007)._
**Conclusions** Vegan diets increase intakes of carbohydrate,
fiber, and several micronutrients, in contrast with the
American Diabetes Association recommended diet. The
vegan group improved its AHEI score whereas the American Diabetes Association recommended diet group’s
AHEI score remained unchanged.

egetarian diets are associated with reduced risk of
some cancers (1-5), heart disease (6), type 2 diabetes
(4,7), and overweight (8,9). Most research on the

# V

nutrient intake of vegetarian diets has focused on selfselected, long-term vegetarians. Less is known about the
nutritional changes of individuals during the transition
to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Furthermore, because a
vegetarian or vegan diet has been shown to be helpful in
managing diabetes (10,11) and heart disease (2), as well
as reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations (11,12)
and body weight (13), it is important to assess the nutrient effects of such a diet in comparison with more conventional therapeutic regimens used for these conditions.
The nutrient intake of individuals adopting a therapeutic
vegan diet has been studied in clinical trials related to
prostate cancer (14), weight loss (15), and heart disease/
cholesterol-lowering (2,11). Little is known about the nutrient profiles of individuals with diabetes adopting a
low-fat vegan diet and how this diet’s nutrient profile
compares to the dietary recommendations set forth by the
American Diabetes Association (16) for people with type 2
diabetes.
The overall diet quality of vegan diets compared to
other therapeutic diets has not been measured. Several
diet quality indexes are available, including the Healthy
Eating Index (HEI) (17), Recommended Food Score (18),
and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) (19).
These indexes estimate chronic disease risk based on
several dietary behaviors. The HEI, one of the first and
most widely used indexes of overall healthful nutrition, is
only weakly correlated with chronic disease risk (20,21).
Therefore, researchers have developed alternatives to the
HEI. The AHEI has been shown to be a better predictor of
risk of cardiovascular disease and other major chronic
diseases (22), compared with the HEI, and a better predictor of the occurrence of inflammation (23) than the
HEI or Recommended Food Score. The AHEI is a nine
component dietary index used to rate foods and macronutrients related to chronic disease risk. Using dietary
intake, researchers can use the AHEI to produce a dietary score ranging from 2.5 to 87.5 (19).
Therefore, a group of individuals with type 2 diabetes
who followed a low-fat, vegan diet or the 2003 dietary
recommendations of the American Diabetes Association
was studied. Because a vegan diet has been shown to be
effective in the treatment of diabetes (10), it is therefore
important to examine the nutrient adequacy and quality
of this diet. A diet used to treat one chronic disease (eg,
type 2 diabetes) should ideally be effective at preventing
other chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease) as well
and should also provide adequate macro- and micronutrients. The goal of this research was to examine the nutritional adequacy and quality of a low-fat vegan diet compared to the dietary recommendations of the American
Diabetes Association.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**
**Participants**
The methods have been described elsewhere (10). Briefly,
99 men and women with type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma
glucose concentration �124.2 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) on two
occasions or a prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with the


use of hypoglycemic medications for �6 months) were
recruited to participate in a study examining the effect of
a low-fat, low-glycemic-index vegan diet on hemoglobin
A1c levels. Participants were recruited through newspaper advertisements in the Washington, DC, area. Exclusion criteria included a hemoglobin A1c level of �6.5% or
�10.5%, current smoking, drug or alcohol abuse, insulin
use �5 years, pregnancy, current use of a low-fat vegetarian diet, or an unstable medical status. The study
protocol was approved by the George Washington University Institutional Review Board and all participants provided written, informed consent.

**Diets, Assessment, and Instruction**
Participants were randomly assigned to the vegan diet or
a diet that followed 2003 American Diabetes Association
guidelines. The vegan diet consisted of grains, fruit, vegetables, and legumes. Participants were instructed to
avoid animal products, limit high-fat foods, and favor
foods with a low glycemic index value. There were no
restrictions on portion sizes or energy intake.
The American Diabetes Association diet was individualized, based on body weight and lipid profile, according
to 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines. American Diabetes Association participants who were overweight (body mass index �25) were prescribed a diet with
an energy deficit of 500 to 1,000 kcal. The exchange
system was used to provide the recommended energy and
carbohydrate and saturated fat grams each participant
required. Each meal plan was individualized to the participant’s current food and eating habits. Neither group
received prepared meals. Rather, participants prepared
foods at home and/or ate at restaurants. Participants
were asked to maintain baseline levels of physical activity for 22 weeks.
Before randomization, participants completed a practice 3-day weighed dietary record that included 1 weekend day and 2 weekdays, which was reviewed by a registered dietitian (RD). Participants then completed a
baseline food record. After randomization, participants
met individually with an RD experienced in the use of the
assigned diet to develop individualized meal plans. Participants then met with their assigned diet groups, led by
an RD and physician, each week for 1 hour for discussions, cooking demonstrations, and meal planning. Meeting topics were similar for both groups and included tips
on eating out, healthful cooking ideas, finding support
from friends and family, grocery store tours, and problem-solving activities. Meetings continued for 22 weeks.
Participants completed additional 3-day dietary records
at 11 and 22 weeks. All participants were provided with a
vitamin B-12 supplement (100 �g) to be taken every other
day and were asked to limit alcohol intake to two drinks
per day for men or one drink per day for women. Participants were asked if they had regularly taken their vitamin B-12 supplement when they were called on their last
dietary recall.

**Dietary Adherence**
Adherence to the diet was assessed based on 22-week
dietary records and 24-hour recalls that were conducted


-----

by telephone by an RD at Week 4, 8, 13, and 20 (one per
week). Participants were unaware of when the calls were
going to be made. The study RD used the multiple-pass
method to collect the recalls. Vegan participants were
considered adherent if they reported an absence of animal products on recalls and 22-week food records, as well
as saturated fat intake �5% of energy, total fat intake
�25%, and cholesterol intake of �50 mg on their 22-week
food records. American Diabetes Association diet participants were considered adherent if they had an average
daily energy intake of no more than 200 kcal in excess of
their prescribed intakes and saturated fat intake �10% of
energy on their 22-week food records. Individuals who
attended fewer than 10 of the 22 weekly meetings were
considered nonadherent on either diet. A Nutrition Coordinating Center-certified RD analyzed all 3-day dietary
records and diet recalls using Nutrition Data System for
Research software version 5.0 (Food and Nutrient Database 35, 2004, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis) (24). Quality control was conducted for both the dietary records and recalls. For the
food records, a second RD reviewed the food records
compared to what was entered into the nutrient database. Discrepancies were addressed and missing foods
were added. A second RD also reviewed the dietary
recalls for any data entry issues related to portion sizes
or amounts.

**Nutrient Intake and Other Measures**
Nutrient intake at baseline and 22 weeks was calculated
from the 3-day food records, averaging values for each
3-day period. AHEI scores were calculated for each participant based on food categories, including vegetables
(servings per day), fruit (servings per day), nuts and soy
protein (servings per day), ratio of white to red meat
(grams), cereal fiber (grams per day), trans fat (percent of
energy), and ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty
acids (grams). Each of these categories received a score
ranging from zero to 10 (19). Although baseline multivitamin use was obtained, duration of multivitamin use
was not and supplement use was not collected at 22
weeks. Alcohol use was not included in the analysis,
because both groups received the same recommendations
(ie, limiting alcohol intake to one drink or equivalent per
day for women and two per day for men). These variables
were not expected to vary according to diet group. Dietary
supplement use was excluded from both the nutrient and
AHEI analyses.
Other measures, such as demographic data, hemoglobin A1c, lipid levels, blood pressure, urinary albumin,
weight, medication use, hip and waist circumference, and
physical activity, were measured at baseline and 22
weeks and have been reported elsewhere (10). Hemoglobin A1c was obtained after a 12-hour fast and was assayed at baseline, 11 weeks, and 22 weeks. At the same
time points, body weight was determined in a paper
gown, without shoes using a digital scale accurate to 0.1
kg. During the 22-week study, the research endocrinologist adjusted diabetes medications in cases of hypoglycemia, as previously reported (10).


**Statistical Methods**
A power analysis was conducted using an 80% chance of
detecting a significant 1.5% between-group difference in
hemoglobin A1c and revealed a need for 49 participants
per group. Between-group t tests were calculated for each
measure to determine whether the changes associated
with the vegan diet were different than those associated
with the American Diabetes Association diet. Within each
diet group, paired comparison t tests were calculated to
test whether the changes from baseline to 22 weeks were
significantly different from zero. The primary analysis of
the main endpoint was based on intention-to-treat and
included all participants. In cases where participants did
not complete 22-week dietary records, baseline values
were brought forward. An � of .05 was used for all statistical tests, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. Pearson’s correlation assessed whether changes in
AHEI score were significantly correlated with hemoglobin A1c and body weight changes for all participants
together and for each diet group. SAS was used for all
analyses (version 8.2, 2001, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary,
NC).

**RESULTS**
Of 1,049 individuals screened by telephone, 99 met participation criteria. Of these participants, 49 were randomly assigned to the vegan group and 50 were assigned
to the American Diabetes Association diet group. Baseline demographic information is reported in Table 1. At
22 weeks, complete nutrient data were available for 46
vegan participants and 42 American Diabetes Association diet group participants. An analysis limited to study
completers did not substantially change the outcomes.
Adherence and medication changes and changes in hemoglobin A1c level and weight during the 22-week study
are described elsewhere (10). Briefly, criteria for dietary
adherence were met by 33 vegan (67%) and 22 American
Diabetes Association ADbA diet (44%) participants. Diabetes medication changes (primarily because of hypoglycemia) were reported by 21 vegan (43%) and 13 American
Diabetes Association diet (26%) participants. Among all
participants, hemoglobin A1c value dropped 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the
American Diabetes Association diet group (P�0.089).
Among those participants without a medication change,
the vegan group saw a significant decrease in hemoglobin
A1c value compared to the American Diabetes Association group (�1.23 vs �0.38 points, respectively; P�0.01).
There was also a significant decrease in weight among
the vegan group as compared to the American Diabetes
Association diet group (�6.5 kg vs �3.1 kg, respectively;
_P�0.01)._

**Nutrient Intake at Baseline and 22 Weeks**
There was no significant difference in nutrient intake
between groups at baseline. The vegan group reduced
mean reported intake of energy, protein, fat (total, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans),
cholesterol, vitamins D and B-12, calcium, selenium, and
sodium. The group increased mean reported intake of
carbohydrate, soluble and insoluble fiber, total vitamin A

activity, beta carotene, vitamins C and K, folate, magnesium, and potassium. The American Diabetes Association
diet group reported significant reductions in energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat (total, saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans), cholesterol, vitamin
D, iron, selenium, and sodium. The American Diabetes
Association diet group reported no significant increases
in intake of any measured nutrient (Table 2).
The vegan group reduced its reported mean intake of
total fat, trans fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty
acid, protein, cholesterol, and vitamin D to a greater
degree than did the American Diabetes Association diet
group (Table 2). There were also significant differences
for carbohydrate, soluble and insoluble fiber, total vitamin A activity and beta carotene, folate, magnesium,
iron, potassium, with the vegan group increasing intakes
of these nutrients and the American Diabetes Association
diet group decreasing or having no change in intakes. The
vegan group increased vitamin C to a greater degree than
did the American Diabetes Association diet group and the
American Diabetes Association diet group reduced sodium intake to a greater degree, compared to the vegan
group. There were no significant differences in changes in
energy, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), vitamins E,
K, B-6, and B-12, calcium, zinc, or selenium intake between groups.
To assess whether vegan and American Diabetes Association diet participants were meeting current Dietary
Reference Intakes (DRI), 22-week data were divided by


sex and compared to the DRI for the 51- to 70-year age
reference group (Table 3). Both groups met recommended
intakes for protein based on Estimated Average Requirement and �10% of total energy. Male and female vegan
participants met Adequate Intakes for dietary fiber (30
g/day for men and 21 g/day for women) but the American
Diabetes Association diet group did not. Both groups met
DRI recommendations for vitamins A, K, C, B-6, and
folate, iron, and selenium. Both male and female American Diabetes Association diet members and female vegan
members met vitamin B-12 recommendations with vegan
men consuming slightly less than recommended values
(2.1�2.4 �g/day). Men and women in the vegan group did
not meet zinc requirements whereas American Diabetes
Association diet participants did. For magnesium, only
female vegan participants met recommended intakes.
Neither group met the DRI for vitamins D or E, calcium,
or potassium and both groups exceeded the sodium recommendations.

**AHEI**
The vegan group improved in every AHEI food category,
including significant increases in vegetable, fruit, nut and
soy protein, and cereal fiber intakes; a decrease in trans
fat intake; and an increase in the PUFA-to-saturated fat
ratio (Table 4). These results were reflected in AHEI
score categories as well. The American Diabetes Association diet group showed changes in one food group (in

creased PUFA-to-saturated fat ratio) and two AHEI score
categories (increases in nuts and soy protein and PUFAto-saturated fat ratio scores). Both groups reduced their
white meat to red meat ratio (only significantly in the
vegan group, largely reflecting a reduction in overall
meat intake).
The vegan group had greater improvements in all
AHEI categories and serving amounts, compared with
the American Diabetes Association diet group, with the
exception of the nuts and soy protein category. The vegan
group significantly improved its overall AHEI score,
while the American Diabetes Association group did not
(P�0.001).
For all participants combined, AHEI score was negatively correlated with both changes in hemoglobin A1c
(r�–0.24, P�0.05) and weight (r�–0.27, P�0.01). That
is, an increase in AHEI score was associated with decreases in both hemoglobin A1c value and weight. There
was no within-group correlation between AHEI score
changes and changes in hemoglobin A1c value (vegan:
_r�–0.18176, P�0.211; American Diabetes Association:_
_r�–0.17707, P�0.219) or changes in weight (vegan: r�–_
0.23318, P�0.107 and American Diabetes Association:
_r�–0.19098, P�0.184)._
Although alcohol use was excluded from the dietary
quality analyses, study participants reported little alcohol use on average. At 22 weeks, average alcohol intake
for the vegan and American Diabetes Association diet
groups (2.3�5.5 and 2.5�8.6 g/day, respectively,
_P�0.9062) was well below the quantities receiving the_
highest AHEI scores (1.5 to 2.5 drinks per day—about
22.5 to 37.5 g/day—for men and 0.5 to 1.5 drinks per
day—7.5 to 22.5 g/day—for women).

**DISCUSSION**
**Nutrient Intake**
Past studies have shown that vegan diets have a high
degree of acceptability among participants, with participants finding a vegan diet as acceptable as their usual
intake (25) or as compared to a standard low-fat diet (26).
Although both groups reduced their energy intake, they
had very different micronutrient profiles. With the exception of carbohydrate, both groups reported similar
changes in macronutrient intake—decreasing fats and
protein intake—although to a greater degree in the vegan
group. The small reported average cholesterol intake in
the vegan group (45.4 mg/day) was partly attributable to
small amounts of animal products consumed by some
participants who were not fully adherent to the diet, as
well as the fact that the Nutrient Data System for Research database may report small amounts of cholesterol
in foods (eg, bread or pasta) that, in fact, may have had
none. Similar nutrient changes were found in a study
comparing the intakes of women following a low-fat
vegan diet for 14 weeks to a low-fat diet based on National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (similar
to the current Therapeutic Lifestyle Change diet recommendations) (15).
In contrast to studies suggesting inadequate vitamin
B-12 intake among some vegan groups (27,28), this study
found that mean vitamin B-12 intake remained within
the recommended range even without considering dietary


supplements. This is most likely due to the inclusion of
foods fortified with vitamin B-12 such as cereals and
soymilks. Despite the popular expectation that vegan and
vegetarian diets are low in iron, these findings confirm
those of other studies that vegans may have higher intakes of iron when compared with omnivores (27). The
iron that the vegan group was consuming at 22 weeks
was, however, all in the nonheme form and therefore may
not be as bioavailable as heme iron. Both groups decreased vitamin D intake, with the vegan group having a
greater drop. Other studies have also found a low intake
of vitamin D among those following a vegan diet (14,15).
Both groups were well below current vitamin D recommendations before beginning their assigned diets as well
as at the 22-week time point.
Regarding intakes of vitamins D and E, calcium, and
potassium, our findings suggest that people following either a low-fat, low-glycemic index vegan diet or an American Diabetes Association recommended diet may wish to
pay particular attention to these nutrients to ensure they
meet their needs. Men and women following an American
Diabetes Association recommended diet and men following a low-fat vegan diet may also wish to increase their
intake of magnesium by including more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Because carbohydrate intake is
restricted in the American Diabetes Association recommended diet, it is important that high-fiber carbohydrates be emphasized to meet fiber recommendations.
People following a vegan diet may wish to emphasize
foods rich in zinc to ensure they meet their needs.
The 2003 American Diabetes Association Guidelines,
which were current at the time of study implementation,
were used with American Diabetes Association diet group
participants. Since then, the 2007 guidelines have been
released (29). These guidelines have many similarities to
the 2003 guidelines but there are some changes that may
have influenced the nutrient intake of the American Diabetes Association diet group. Fiber has a greater emphasis in the updated diet recommendations. People with
diabetes are encouraged to consume 14 g fiber per 1,000
kcal per day and have half of daily grain intake come from
whole grains. Although Glycemic Index and Glycemic
Load are not recommended as necessary components of
healthful diet planning, the guidelines do state that use
of Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load may provide a
slight additional benefit over considering carbohydrate
content alone. Finally, the 2007 American Diabetes Association guidelines state that everyone with diabetes
should consume a diet with �200 mg cholesterol/day,
whereas 2003 guidelines only recommended this level to
those with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels (29).

**AHEI**
The AHEI is strongly negatively associated with risk of
major chronic diseases and cardiovascular disease but
not most cancers (19). The AHEI has been shown to have
an inverse relationship with estrogen receptor-negative
breast cancer (30) but not genetically linked (ie, BRCA
gene-associated) breast cancer (31). We found that AHEI
score was negatively correlated with changes in hemoglobin A1c value and weight. Similar results were found in a
study examining AHEI score and women with type 2


-----

diabetes revealing that AHEI score was inversely correlated with the risk for type 2 diabetes (32).
Both groups reduced their white-meat-to-red-meat ratio, as scored by the AHEI. This does not necessarily
reflect an increase in red meat intake in both groups.
According to the AHEI scoring criteria, an individual who
ate no meat at all (receiving a ratio of zero) or who ate less
than two servings of meat in 1 month (equivalent to �5.7
g/day) would receive the highest AHEI score for that
category. Therefore, for many participants, a decrease in
their white-meat-to-red-meat ratio reflected a decrease in
overall meat consumption (ratio going from less than zero
to zero) and not an increase in red meat consumption.
McCullough and colleagues (19) reported AHEI scores
for men and women in a 2002 study and reported risk of
developing major chronic diseases and cardiovascular
disease in each score quintile. When controlling for smoking, men in the highest AHEI score quintile (median
score 52.3) had a relative risk of 0.80 for major chronic
disease (95% confidence interval 0.71, 0.91; P�0.001) and
a 39% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease,
compared with men in the lowest quintile (median score
31). With women, models that underwent multivariate
adjustment were nonsignificant, but unadjusted analyses
showed that women in the highest AHEI score quintile
(median score 59.9) had a relative risk of 0.89 for major
chronic disease (95% confidence interval 0.82, 0.96;
_P�0.008) and a 28% lower risk of developing cardiovas-_
cular disease compared with women in the lowest quintile
(median score 25.4) (19). Even without the addition of
multivitamin or alcohol AHEI scores (which would add to
the total AHEI score), the male vegan group’s mean score
of 52.7�16.4 is in the second highest quintiles for men
and the female vegan group’s mean score of 55.3�19.4 is
in the highest quintile as reported in the study by McCullough and colleagues (19). This score is associated
with a low risk of developing major chronic disease and
cardiovascular disease. The American Diabetes Association diet group’s score remained unchanged and, with a
mean of 29.4�18.5 for men and 36.7�2.2 for women,
places them in the lowest quintile for men and the third
quintile for women (19).
Although the vegan group significantly improved its
AHEI score in every food category, of particular note is
the increase in fruit and vegetable intake. Whereas the
American Diabetes Association diet group did not have a
significant improvement in the number of vegetables or
fruit consumed, the vegan group had an increase from
four servings of fruit and vegetables per day to seven and
one half servings each day.
In this short-term study, it was not possible to correlate
the AHEI with the occurrence of chronic diseases such as
cancer or heart disease. It was possible, however, to correlate AHEI score with two factors that are associated
with improvements in diabetes status, finding that AHEI
score was correlated with changes in both weight and
hemoglobin A1c value. This suggests that AHEI score
may provide a useful tool in assessing dietary quality
among people with diabetes and assessing future improvement in diabetes disease state.
The strengths of the study include a prospective design and an intention-to-treat analysis. The principal
weakness is the reliance on self-reported dietary in

take, which has been the subject of several critiques
(33,34). This is an inevitable issue among individuals
not confined to a metabolic ward. Reductions in clinical
variables, such as weight, lipid concentrations, and
hemoglobin A1c value, suggest that both groups made
diet changes.
This study examined nutrient changes after 22 weeks
in persons with type 2 diabetes. Future research should
examine long-term dietary changes on both vegan and
American Diabetes Association–recommended diets. This
research should also examine long-term changes in clinical measures, such as hemoglobin A1c and lipid values,
and examine these measures in relation to AHEI score.

**CONCLUSIONS**
Vegan and American Diabetes Association–recommended
dietary profiles are very different in both macro- and
micronutrient intakes. The vegan group had significant
improvements in energy, total fat, trans fat, cholesterol,
and fiber. The vegan group also saw significant improvements in intakes of several vitamins and minerals, including total vitamin A activity, beta carotene, vitamin K,
vitamin C, folate, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.
The American Diabetes Association–recommended diet
group had significant improvements in energy, total fat,
_trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium intakes. Both groups_
had difficulty meeting the recommended intakes for vitamins D and E, calcium, and potassium and consumed too
much sodium, albeit less than at baseline.
The vegan group improved all food group categories
and saw a significant increase in AHEI score, which was
associated with improvements in both weight and hemoglobin A1c value. The American Diabetes Association diet
group saw no improvement in AHEI score. Because the
AHEI is strongly negatively associated with risk of major
chronic diseases (19), the results of this study suggest
that, if followed for the long-term, a low-fat vegan diet
may be associated with a reduced risk of major chronic
diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease.
