 Background: With obesity rampant, methods to achieve sustained weight loss remain elusive. Objective: To compare the long-term weight-loss efficacy of 2 cal and fat-restricted diets, standard (omnivorous) versus lacto– ovo–vegetarian, and to determine the effect of a chosen diet versus an assigned diet. Design, subjects: A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 176 adults who were sedentary and overweight (mean body mass index, 34.0 kg/m[2]). Participants were first randomly assigned to either receive their preferred diet or be assigned to a diet group and second, were given their diet of preference or randomly assigned to a standard weight-loss diet or a lacto–ovo– vegetarian diet. Participants underwent a university-based weight-control program consisting of daily dietary and exercise goals plus 12 months of behavioral counseling followed by a 6-month maintenance phase. Measurements: Percentage change in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, low- and high-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin and macronutrient intake. Results: The program was completed by 132 (75%) of the participants. At 18 months, mean percentage weight loss was greater (P ¼ 0.01) in the two groups that were assigned a diet (standard, 8.0% (s.d., 7.8%); vegetarian, 7.9% (s.d., 8.1%)) than in those provided the diet of their choice (standard, 3.9% (s.d., 6.1%); vegetarian, 5.3% (s.d., 6.2%)). No difference was observed in weight loss between the two types of diet. Over the 18-month program, all groups showed significant weight loss. Conclusions: Participants assigned to their dietary preference did not have enhanced treatment outcomes. However, all groups lost weight with losses ranging from 4 to 8% at 18 months.

published online 14 August 2007 group found that a vegetarian meal plan combined with a

behavioral weight-counseling intervention led to weight loss
and that those who followed the plan had not regained
weight at 18 months.[11] Literature suggests that changing
from a diet containing meat and fish to a vegetarian diet may
result in reduced calorie and saturated-fat intake, an increase
in energy from carbohydrates, resulting in a leaner body
mass[12] and less weight regain.[13] While these findings are
promising, they may have been partially attributable to a
self-selection effect among those who adhered to the diet.
Moreover, to our knowledge, only one study of vegetarian
diets has targeted weight loss and that study used the more
restrictive 10% fat and vegan diet.[14,15] No randomizedcontrolled trials have examined the role of the less restrictive
lacto–ovo–vegetarian diet (LOV-D) in weight loss.
Participant preference is another factor in the success of
many treatments but has rarely been examined in weightloss efficacy.[16–19] Conceptual models such as behavioral
choice theory[20] postulate that those who are matched to
treatment based on their personal choices will demonstrate
better outcomes than those assigned to a treatment that does
not match their personal preference. The few studies that
have examined the effect of providing participants their
preferred weight-loss treatment have produced inconsistent
findings.[16–18] Moreover, the longest study was only 6
months in duration, thus not permitting an evaluation of
the long-term effects of receiving one’s preference. Our
preliminary study[7] did not take preference into account in
the random assignment to diet, and we are unaware of any
randomized clinical trials that have examined treatment
preference using diets that include a vegetarian option.
We designed the present study to test two hypotheses: (1)
choice of either a standard calorie- and fat-restricted diet
(STD-D) or a calorie- and fat-restricted LOV-D would result in
greater weight loss compared to having one of these diets
randomly assigned; and (2) an LOV-D would result in greater
weight loss than a STD-D.
We chose to test both of these hypotheses together to
address the potential effect of selection bias in the successful
adoption and long-term adherence to a LOV-D. We also
evaluated the effect of the treatment assignment on waist
circumference, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), glucose,
insulin and selected macronutrients and adherence to the
treatment protocol.

### Materials and methods

#### Design overview
The recruitment, randomization, treatment methods and
the baseline characteristics of the study cohort have been
detailed elsewhere and are summarized here.[21] Termed the
PREFER study, it was a single center, randomized clinical trial
designed to evaluate the effects of treatment preference and
two different diets (STD-D versus LOV-D) on weight loss.

#### Setting and participants
We recruited 200 participants in three cohorts, which were
staggered from September 2002 to May 2004, via mass
mailings from purchased lists; a database of individuals
seeking weight-loss treatment; and telephone announcements to staff and faculty at the University of Pittsburgh and
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Eligibility criteria
were (1) age 18–55 years, (2) body mass index (BMI) of 27
through 43, (3) willingness to be randomly assigned to 1 of 2
treatment-preference conditions and 1 of 2 dietary conditions, (4) successful completion of a 5-day food dairy; and (5)
willingness and ability to provide informed consent. Exclusion criteria were (1) a current medical condition requiring
physician supervision of diet or physical activity (for
example, diabetes, post-acute myocardial infarction), (2)
physical limitation restricting exercise ability, (3) pregnancy
or intention to become pregnant during the 18-month study,
(4) current treatment with a medication that might affect
weight, (5) alcohol intake 44 drinks/day, (6) participation in
a weight-loss program, or use of a weight-loss medication
within the past 6 months, and (7) abstention from eating
meat, poultry or fish in the past month. Eligible individuals
attended an information session, where they completed a
one-page form on which they ranked their preference for
each of the two dietary options on a three-point Likert scale;
a ‘mild’ preference or no preference for one diet over the
other, disqualified them from the study. Baseline measures
were conducted before randomization at the General
Clinical Research Center (GCRC).
A power analysis based on weight loss at 18 months was
conducted a priori. On the basis of a fixed-effects analysis of
variance (ANOVA) this analysis indicated that 33 participants in each of the four groups would provide 80% power
to detect a modest effect size for the interaction between diet
and preference at a significance level of 0.05. To test the
main effects of diet and preference using two-sided twosample t-tests with a significance level of 0.05, 66 participants in both diet groups and both preference groups would
provide 80% power to detect a 2.2 kg difference between the
groups assuming a common s.d. of 4.4 kg (d ¼ 0.50).

#### Randomization and interventions
After stratifying for gender, ethnicity and diet preference,
200 participants were randomly assigned to one of four
groups (Preference-Yes þ standard diet (STD-D), PreferenceYes þ LOV-D, Preference-No þ STD-D, and PreferenceNo þ LOV-D) through a two-stage randomization process,
using minimization procedures.[22] In stage 1, participants
were randomized to one of the two preference groupsF
Preference-Yes or Preference-NoFwith a randomization
ratio of 3:2 (Figure 1). We over sampled the Preference-Yes
group because we expected that a smaller proportion of our
population would select the LOV-D. The 3:2 ratio was
chosen, because in our pilot study approximately two-thirds
of the participants indicated a preference for the standard

was randomized with equal allocation to the STD-D or LOV-D.
Nine participants were excluded after study enrollment
because they no longer met eligibility criteria; thus, 176
participants are included in the present analyses.

Common components of the intervention. All participants
attended weekly group sessions for the first 6 months,
biweekly for months 7–9, and monthly for months 10–12.
These sessions were based on standard behavioral therapy
(SBT) for weight loss, a well-established approach that
incorporates instruction and counseling in changing behaviors, modifying dietary intake to decrease the number of
calories and amount of fat eaten, and increasing physical
activity.[3,4]. Other characteristics of SBT include treatment
delivered in the form of planned lessons to a group of 10–20
participants for approximately 12 months, weekly sessions
initially with subsequent less frequent meetings, establishment of dietary and activity goals, self-monitoring with
written feedback provided by the interventionists, provision
of nutritional information, and application of several
behavioral change strategies that have been proven to be
effective, for example, modifying one’s environment,
problem-solving, modifying ‘all or nothing’ thinking and
preventing relapse.[23] The sessions were led by a dietitian,
exercise physiologist, or nurse-behavioral scientist and
focused on behavioral strategies for modifying one’s lifestyle,
for example, controlling portion sizes, being assertive in
social situations where there may be pressure to abandon
healthy eating behaviors.
At the first session, participants were instructed to reduce
their maximum daily calorie as follows: those weighing
o90.5 kg at baseline, 1200 kcal for women and 1500 kcal
for men; if baseline weight exceeded 90.5 kg, 1500 kcal for
women, and 1800 kcal for men. These guidelines are based
on the standard weight-loss treatment goal of 1–2 lbs per
week.[4] All participants were to reduce fat intake to 25% of
total kilocalorie intake and to engage in physical activity, for
example, walking, for at least 50 min per week initially,
gradually increasing to at least 150 min per week by week 6.
We instructed them to monitor and record their daily
physical activity and calorie and fat content of foods eaten
in the provided weekly diary. At each session, a new diary
was provided; completed diaries were collected and returned
at the next session after interventionists reviewed and
annotated the diaries. Diary and session materials were sent
to individuals who missed a session. If participants missed
two consecutive sessions, a letter was sent encouraging their
return. After 12 months, the maintenance phase began, and
no further contact was made with participants until the final
(18-month) assessment. Additional details on the intervention are reported elsewhere.[21]

Dietary interventions. The only difference between the two
diets was the elimination of meat, poultry and fish
consumption by the sixth week for the two vegetarian-diet
groups. Participants were instructed to eliminate these food

groups at breakfast, then lunch, and then dinner and to
record in their diaries when they ate meals containing these
foods. Numerous opportunities were provided at the group
sessions to taste vegetarian foods while the standard-diet
group tasted low-fat foods. A nutritionist who was vegetarian
led four LOV-D group sessions and was able to advise
participants on how to adopt the more restrictive eating
plan, as well as include children and other family members
in the new dietary plan. The LOV-D group members also
recorded the number of meals they ate that included any
meat, fish or poultry in their weekly diaries. For an incentive,
LOV-D participants received the magazine Vegetarian Times
while the STD-D participants received Cooking Light. A
cooking class and shopping tour focused on vegetarian
dishes and foods for the LOV-D group and low-fat dishes
and foods for the STD-D group. Otherwise, the content and
behavioral strategies taught in the group sessions were the
same for both diet groups.

#### Outcomes and follow-up
Body weight and waist circumference were obtained before
randomization (baseline) and every 6 months for the next
18 months. The primary dependent measure was change in
body weight from baseline to 18 months, calculated as percentage change to control for the baseline weight differences
between the preference groups. Trained staff measured body
weight, height and waist circumference at the GCRC using
standardized procedures, forms and equipment. Weight was
measured on the Tanita Digital Scale with the participant in
light clothing and no shoes. Height was measured at baseline
and 18 months on a wall-mounted stadiometer. Height and
weight measurements were used to calculate BMI (kg/m[2]).
Waist circumference was measured two times using a Gullick
II measuring tape. If the two values were within 2 cm of each
other, an average value was computed as the outcome
measure. If agreement within 2 cm was absent, the measurement was taken until agreement was met. Blood was drawn
after a 12-h, overnight fast and 15-min rest period and stored
at �701C until assayed at the Heinz Nutrition Laboratory,
University of Pittsburgh, by personnel blinded to treatment
group assignment. Total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C and
triglycerides were measured enzymatically on an Abbot VP
Supersystem autoanalyzer by standardized methods according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
LDL-C was estimated using the Friedewald equation.[24]

Plasma glucose was quantitatively determined by an enzymatic determination rad at 340/380 nm with couple enzyme
reactions catalyzed by hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase. Insulin was measured using a radioactive
immunoassay procedure developed by Linco Research Inc.
Dietary data were collected in the form of 3-day food records
which included two work days and one leisure day. The
diaries were reviewed by trained research staff for completeness and clarity. The data were entered in the computer
using the Nutrition Data System-Research (NDS-R) software

program by staff at the Obesity/Nutrition Research Center
who were blinded to treatment group and time (The
Minnesota Nutrition Data System for Research, www.ncc.
umn.edu, accessed 20 April 2007).

#### Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using SAS (version 9.1.3, SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Exploratory data analysis methods were
used to screen for outliers, assess missing data and evaluate
whether underlying statistical assumptions were satisfied.
No outliers were identified through data screening. Data
were mainly missing due to participant attrition (25%,
n ¼ 44), which occurred at varying points in time and to a
lesser extent a single intermittent missed visit. These data
were assumed to be missing at random. Appropriate group
comparative procedures (for example, ANOVA, Kruskal–
Wallis test, w[2] analyses and Fisher’s exact test) were used to
compare Preference (yes/no) groups, diet groups, and their
combinations on participant characteristics and response
variables at baseline. The primary end point of interest when
testing the stated hypotheses was body weight; secondary
endpoints included BMI, waist circumference, LDL-C,
HDL-C, glucose, insulin and macronutrient intake. Percent
change scores (that is, change from baseline to follow-up
standardized by percentage change from baseline) were used
as the dependent variable in analysis for each outcome. Since
these data were longitudinally assessed, repeated measures
analyses using mixed effects modeling was employed as it
allows for data that are missing at random, the inclusion
of fixed- and time-dependent covariates, and the modeling
of the covariance matrix. Mixed models were estimated for
each outcome using the restricted maximum likelihood
method. While fitting these models the best-fitting covariance pattern for the repeated measures was determined
using information criteria (that is, AIC and BIC). Weight and
BMI were modeled by a heterogeneous Toeplitz covariance
structure, while glucose, insulin, LDL-C and HDL-C were
modeled by a compound symmetric covariance structure.
The effects included in the mixed model included fixed
effects for diet, preference, time and their interactions and a
random effect for participant and cohort. Because baseline
values differed for weight and cholesterol between preference groups, these values were initially included in the
models as covariates. F-tests using the Kenward–Roger
method for degrees of freedom were used for hypothesis
testing. The level of significance for two-sided hypothesis
testing was set at 0.05. On the basis of residual analyses, the
underlying assumption of multivariate normality was supported and no outliers in solution were found.
Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to check the robustness of the findings due to the identified covariates, the
possible random cohort effects, and the method of handling
missing data. Similar findings for fixed effects (parameter
estimates and test statistics) were obtained regardless of
whether or not covariates were included in the repeated


measures model. Random effects for cohort were not found
to be statistically significant in the estimated models. Similar
results were again obtained for parameter estimates and test
statistics using alternate methods to handle missing data (for
example, direct maximum likelihood estimation via mixed
modeling, last-observation-carried forward approach, listwise deletion). Given the findings for these sensitivity
analyses, the results based on mixed effect models, which
included no additional terms for cohort or covariates, are
reported. Missing data were handled directly through
maximum likelihood estimation using all available data.
We also conducted an analysis of the completers (n ¼ 112)
and found the same results as those derived from the mixed
effects modeling.

#### Statement of ethics
We certify that all applicable institutional and governmental
regulations concerning the ethical use of human volunteers
were followed during this research. The University of
Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board approved the study
protocol, and all participants provided written informed
consent before enrollment. The study was registered with the
National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry, NCT
study no. 00330629.

### Results

As detailed in Table 1, demographic characteristics did not
differ when we compared groups; however, as shown in
Table 2, baseline differences were found between PreferenceYes and Preference-No participants on mean weight, Yes, 98.
14 (s.d., 12.7) kg; No, 93.64 (s.d., 16.4) kg, P ¼ 0.01. Overall,
132 (75%) of the 176 participants completed the 18-month
assessment; attrition did not differ among the groups
(w[2] ¼ 0.92, P ¼ 0.82; Figure 1). Compared to participants who
completed the final assessment, those who did not complete
were younger (41.3 (s.d., 9.0) years versus 44.9 (s.d., 8.5) years,
Po0.02) and weighed more at baseline (220.5 (s.d., 32.2) kg
versus 207.3 (s.d., 32.3) kg, P ¼ 0.02). There was no difference
among the groups in adherence to the study protocol
(P40.05). Overall, mean attendance at group sessions was
71.3% (s.d., 27.6%) during the first 6 months (weekly
sessions) and decreased to 51.8% (s.d., 37.8%) during the
next 6 months (biweekly and monthly sessions).

#### Change in body weight, BMI and waist circumference
Table 2 shows the weights for all four groups at each
assessment. Figure 2 illustrates patterns of weight change
over each measurement point. A preference by time interaction (P ¼ 0.02) and a time effect (Po0.001) were found for
the change in weight from baseline to 18 months. At 6
months, participants in the Preference-Yes þ LOV-D group
had a �9.9% (CI, �11.9 to �7.6%) weight change; those in

the Preference-Yes þ STD-D group had a �7.4% (CI, �9.2 to
�5.5%) weight change. Participants in the PreferenceNo þ LOV-D group had a �9.3% (CI, �11.1 to �7.3%) weight
change; those in the Preference-No þ STD-D group had a
�9.4% (CI, �11.0 to �7.3%) weight change. For all groups,
these were significant changes from their baseline weights
(Po0.001). Between months 6 and 18, there was a significant
difference in weight regain between preference groups;
participants who chose their diet regained 4.5% (CI, �5.8 to
�3.2%) while those with assigned diets regained 2.1% (CI,
�3.4 to �0.8%) (Po0.001). All four groups regained weight
during the maintenance phase (months 13–18). Over time,
the different diets produced no difference in percentage
weight change (P ¼ 0.30), nor was there a preference � diet
interaction (P ¼ 0.34). For BMI, there was no preference � diet
interaction (P ¼ 0.43), but the preference � time interaction
was significant in predicting BMI change (P ¼ 0.02); a marginal effect for preference alone was observed (P ¼ 0.06). The
mixed model analysis revealed that the preference � time
interaction was also marginal in predicting percent change in
waist circumference over time (P ¼ 0.07).

#### Change in LDL-C, HDL-C, glucose and insulin
At 6 months, participants on the LOV-D had greater changes
in LDL-C than those on the STD-D, with respective changes


of �2.9% (CI, �7.7 to 1.7%) and 2.8% (CI, �1.4 to 7.0%)
(P ¼ 0.07); however, no significant effect of diet on LDL-C
was observed at 18 months (P ¼ 0.53). Although we found a
significant effect for time on insulin and HDL-C with a 9.3%
(CI, �14.8 to �3.8%) reduction in insulin and 3.5% (CI,
0.91–6.1%) increase in HDL, Po0.001, there were no
significant main effects or interactions on glucose or LDL-C
over time.

#### Changes in energy and selected macronutrient intake
Changes observed in kilocalorie consumption over the
course of the 18-month study and changes in carbohydrates,
fat, animal and vegetable protein and fiber are reported in
Table 3. A mixed model analysis revealed a significant main
effect for time for percent change in total energy (Po0.001),
fat (Po0.0001), animal protein (Po0.0001), vegetable
protein (P ¼ 0.02), and fiber (P ¼ 0.05). We observed no
significant interactions between diet, time or preference in
differences in kilocalorie and macronutrient intake among
the four groups at 18 months. There was a main effect for

#### Adherence to dietary goals
A secondary hypothesis was that individuals who were in
the LOV-D group would be more adherent to the treatment
protocol than those in the STD-D group. Although no
difference in adherence to attendance, exercise or selfmonitoring was noted between the groups, there was a
significant main effect for diet in adherence to the fat-gram

International Journal of Obesity


goal (P ¼ 0.01) and a marginal effect for adherence to the
calorie goal (P ¼ 0.06) with the LOV-D group participants
having higher adherence than those in the STD-D groups
(data not shown). However, within the LOV-D group, not all
participants were adherent to the LOV dietary guidelines,
which required eliminating the consumption of meat, fish
and poultry.

### Discussion

This is the first randomized controlled trial that tested the
combination of diet (STD-D and LOV-D) and random
assignment to one’s preferred diet (yes/no) on weight loss
and selected physical and biological outcome measures at 18
months. A strength of our study is the excellent retention.
Seventy-five percent of participants completed this trial
despite having no contact with the study personnel during
the 12- to 18-month maintenance phase; similar retention
rates have been reported for previously conducted weight
loss trials. Jakicic et al.[25] reported 78% retention after an 18month behavioral intervention for weight loss, and Renjilian
et al.[18] reported a 78% retention rate after 6 months, similar
to our 18-month retention (75%). Worth noting, these
studies did not include a no-contact maintenance period
after the active intervention, as our study did.
We tested the hypotheses that following a reduced calorie
and fat LOV-D would result in greater weight loss than
following a standard, reduced calorie and fat diet (STD-D)
and that the capacity to select either of these diets would
result in greater weight loss compared to having one of these
diets randomly assigned; however, our results refute that a
LOV-D or being assigned to one’s preferred diet would be
more likely to produce greater weight loss. On the contrary,
participants who were not assigned to their preferred diet
had a significantly greater weight loss than those who
were allowed to choose their dietary treatment. However, it
is worth noting that those in the LOV-D groups had a
significantly greater reduction in animal protein and greater
increases in vegetable protein and in dietary fiber, all
beneficial changes.
Four studies have examined treatment choice in relation
to weight loss among adults.[16,26,27,18] All of these studies had
limitations in the duration of the treatment and one study
in retention, making it difficult to compare findings. A study


with a similar design to the one reported in this paper was
conducted concurrent to our trial. Renjilian et al.[18] examined the effects of matching participants to treatments based
on preferences for either individual or group therapy in the
treatment of obesity. They randomly assigned 75 obese
adults to either their preferred or nonpreferred option and
found no significant effect of treatment preference or the
interaction of treatment preference by type of therapy.
Group therapy produced significantly greater weight loss,
even among participants who preferred individual treatment. This study, which was 6 months in duration and did
not conduct a post-treatment follow-up, found that the
treatment itself was more important than the individual’s
preference, which is not a total contradiction of our findings.
Our findings demonstrated that those who did not receive
their preferred treatment did better than those who received
their treatment of choice. An explanation for this finding is
not readily apparent; however, it might be explained by the
PreferenceFNo participants’ determination to succeed despite their assignment, or simply that they forgot what their
original preference was and therefore it did not influence
how they carried out the behavior change over the
subsequent 18 months. Another possible explanation might
be that the individuals who received their preferred treatment option might have expected more than what they
received, or that they were overly confident in how they
would do considering that they received their preferred
treatment group and then realized that it was as difficult as
other weight-loss approaches. This may be particularly
relevant to those who selected the standard-diet group since
they had the least weight change. Our study results, taken
with the findings of others who have studied choice, have
demonstrated that providing a study participant his or her
choice of treatment does not necessarily lead to improved
adherence or improved outcomes. On the basis of general
adherence literature, it may be more important to explore

the role of shared decision-making.[28] Studies have demonstrated enhanced adherence when individuals are permitted
to participate in their care and the treatment decisions,
which may be more meaningful than receiving their
preferred treatment.[29,30]

Some have implicated a selection bias in the successful
outcomes of studies testing vegetarian diets.[19] Our experience in this study does not support this notion. Only 8 of the
932 candidates we screened declined participation because of
concern that they would be assigned to a vegetarian diet and
no one withdrew from the study because they were not
assigned to the diet of their choice. Thus, preference had no
effect on the external or internal validity of the study. The
literature suggests that individuals who follow a vegetarian

International Journal of Obesity


eating plan report greater satisfaction and are more likely to
maintain this eating pattern.[5,31,6] Indeed, we found that the
LOV-D group was more adherent to the prescribed calorieand fat-gram goals than the STD-D group and were very
successful in achieving a clinically significant weight loss.
However, being adherent to the meatless diet became a
challenge over time, resulting in the LOV-D group participants eating a diet that may have been similar to the STD-D
group. This may explain the lack of statistically significant
differences between the two diet groups.
A limitation of this study, as well as other weight-loss
trials,[32] is the small representation of male participants. This
limitation may be the result of this being a study testing a
vegetarian diet, or as previously reported data suggest, it may

be due to the fact that a lower percentage of men than
women are trying to lose weight.[33,34] Unfortunately, a recent
study found an increased prevalence of obesity among
males;[1] therefore, we need to develop strategies to better
recruit men into weight-loss studies. Given that the males
in our study were highly adherent to the vegetarian diet,
further research is warranted regarding the effects of a
vegetarian diet on weight loss among men.
In summary, our study found that the opportunity to
choose a treatment did not result in improved weight loss
and that random assignment to the nonpreferred diet
resulted in better weight loss than did receiving the diet of
choice. Thus, matching individuals to their choice did not
enhance treatment outcome for the short or long term.
However, all groups lost weight with the losses ranging from
4 to 8%, losses that are clinically significant. Moreover, there
were significant improvements in most groups over time
in BMI, waist circumference, HDL-C, and insulin, changes
that have implications for the prevention of comorbidities
associated with obesity. These data suggest that study
participation in general was more important than treatment
preference or dietary treatment in weight loss and maintenance.
