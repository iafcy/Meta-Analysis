Abstract

Purpose. This study evaluated the effect of the Dr. Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart
Disease on cardiovascular disease as measured by the intima-media thickness of the common
carotid artery and compared this effect to outcomes from patients participating in traditional
cardiac rehabilitation.

Design. Randomized clinical trial.
Setting. SwedishAmerican Health System.
Subjects. Ninety three patients with clinically confirmed coronary artery disease were
randomly assigned to the intervention (n 5 46) or traditional cardiac rehabilitation (n 5 47).

Intervention. Dr. Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease.
Measures. Ultrasound of the carotid artery and other cardiovascular risk factors were
measured at baseline, 6, and 12 months.

Analysis. Intent-to-treat analysis.
Results. There was no significant reduction in the carotid intima-media thickness of the
carotid artery in the Ornish group or the cardiac rehabilitation group. Ornish Program
participants had significantly improved dietary habits (p, .001), weight (p, .001), and
body mass index (p, .001) as compared with the rehabilitation group. The decrease in the
number of patients with angina from baseline to 12 months was 44% in Ornish and 12% in
cardiac rehabilitation.

Conclusions. The Ornish Program appears to causes improvements in cardiovascular risk
factors but does not appear to change the atherosclerotic process as it affects the carotid artery.

involving diet, exercise, body weight,
and abstinence from smoking.
Hence, lifestyle changes have the
potential to dramatically impact the
cardiovascular disease process and
mortality.

The carotid artery intima-media
thickness measured by ultrasound imaging is a valid indicator of atherosclerosis. It correlates well with the
incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction, and other cardiovascular events.[3–5]

It is also a useful predictor of the
severity and extent of coronary artery
disease[6] and cardiovascular risk factors.[7] Intima-media thickness is influenced by a variety of cardiovascular
risk factors,[8] including cholesterol,[9]

triglycerides,[10] glucose tolerance,[11,12]

physical activity,[13–15] dietary saturated
fat,[16] body fat,[17] and hypertension.[18]

Consumption of certain phytochemicals has also been linked with reductions in intima-media thickness.[19,20]

The links among unhealthy behaviors,
elevated cardiovascular risk, and intima-media thickness are convincing.

The Dr. Dean Ornish Program for
Reversing Heart Disease[21] is an aggressive, comprehensive lifestyle modification program with the goal of improving cardiovascular risk factors. It
includes a vegetarian, very low-fat diet,
exercise, stress management, and
group support. Previous studies of the
Ornish Program have been able to
demonstrate significant reductions of
risk factors for program participants.[22,23] The Lifestyle Heart Trial
reported that the Ornish Program
decreased coronary artery stenosis in
the experimental group, while coronary artery stenosis increased in the
control group.[24] This trial had a limited

lecture, and a meal. The length of stage
2 was variable depending on medical
status and program adherence lasting
from 3 to 9 months. Each participant’s
progress was managed in person or by
telephone for 1 year.

Stage 3 included participation in an
alumni-based community of previous
program participants, designed to continue encouragement and support to
reinforce lifestyle modifications learned
in the program. Participants were encouraged to attend monthly alumni
meetings for as long as they liked.

The program encouraged a plantbased diet composed of 75% of total
calories from complex carbohydrates,
at least 15% calories from protein, and
less than 10% of total calories from fat.
The diet recommended liberal consumption of fruit and vegetables,
whole grains, and legumes; a daily
serving of soy food; a multivitamin and
a flax source of omega-3-fatty acids;
and moderate sugar intake.

Participants met with an exercise
physiologist who prescribed an individualized exercise program that was
medically appropriate according to
a baseline exercise treadmill test. During stage 1 an exercise physiologist and
a nurse supervised participants twice
a week for 1 hour of group exercise.
Daily independent exercise of at least
30 minutes was also greatly encouraged. During stage 3 of the program
participants were expected to continue
to exercise on their own. Being physically active for the remainder of their
lifetime was the ultimate goal of this
component.

Participants met for 2 hours each
week in stage 1 and 1 hour each week
in stage 2 to increase relaxation,
concentration, and awareness through
stress management. The stress management techniques, taught by a certified instructor, were partially based on
Hatha yoga.

Participants attended a 1-hour group
support meeting twice a week during
stage 1 and once a week during stage 2.
The sessions were led by licensed
mental health professionals.

Traditional Cardiac Rehabilitation

The five main components of traditional cardiac rehabilitation are medical evaluation, prescribed exercise,
cardiac risk factor modification, edu

number of subjects (15 control and 20
experimental subjects), and more than
50% of those that began the study
dropped out because they did not wish
to do an additional angiogram. The
rationale for the Ornish Program is
that lifestyle change can impact cardiovascular disease in a systemic manner. All vessels of the body, including
those of the heart, could potentially be
impacted by a healthy lifestyle. With
the use of a noninvasive intima-media
thickness measure, more participants
would be willing to tolerate the outcome data collection and data could be
gathered from the carotid artery of the
neck, rather than just coronary arteries. In addition, there are no published data that show that the Ornish
Program offered at a site without the
presence of Dr. Dean Ornish can alter
the atherosclerotic process.

The objective of this study was to
evaluate the effect of the Ornish Program on cardiovascular disease as
measured by the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery and
to compare this effect to outcomes
from patients participating in traditional cardiac rehabilitation.

METHODS

Participants

From August 2000 to July 2003 a total
of 93 patients with clinically confirmed
coronary artery disease from the metropolitan Rockford, Illinois area were
recruited into the study. Potential
participants were recruited through
analysis of SwedishAmerican Hospital’s
admission and discharge information
sheets and community-wide marketing
through the print and radio media.
Participants were included if they had
at least two of the following three
criteria: chest pain lasting at least
30 minutes continuously, electrocardiogram changes typical of an evolving
myocardial infarction (ST segment
elevation or depression, evolving Q
waves, or symmetric inversion of T
waves), or elevated levels of cardiac
enzymes. Patients were also accepted
into the study if they demonstrated any
of the following: myocardial infarction
within the past 12 months, coronary
artery bypass graft surgery, stent placement, rotoblator within the prior
12 months, stable angina, or pace

makers associated with one or more of
the above diagnoses. Exclusion criteria
included history of substance abuse
disorder without documentation of at
least 1 year of abstinence, history of
psychiatric disorder without documentation of at least 1 year of stability,
impaired cognitive function such as
dementia or delirium, participation in
other lipid-lowering or lifestyle modification trials, and others which were
previously documented.[24]

Prior to program assignment, all
interested patients were oriented by
a physician or nurse concerning the
Ornish and traditional cardiac rehabilitation programs. Following this
brief orientation each patient completed the informed consent form
before participation in the study.
Participants were randomly assigned
to either the Ornish (n 5 49) or
traditional cardiac rehabilitation program (n 5 49). The study was approved by the institutional review
board of the SwedishAmerican Health
System. Participation in the study was
free of charge to the patients, and
patients in both groups received
standard care as prescribed by their
doctors.

Ornish Program

The Dr. Dean Ornish Program for
Reversing Heart Disease combines diet, exercise, stress management, and
group support to lower risk of cardiovascular disease. This program was
delivered in three separate stages.
Stage 1 included an intensive 12-week
component in which participants met
for two 4-hour sessions each week. This
began once the patient was discharged
from the hospital. The sessions included supervised exercise, stress
management, a meal, lifestyle-related
lecture, and group support.

Before beginning stage 2 participants
were evaluated and compared with
a risk-stratification assessment model.
This aided in determining the level of
intervention appropriate for stage 2 by
assessing the participants’ ability to
adhere to the program and the severity
of their disease. Most of the activity in
stage 2 was self-directed, but participants
were encouraged to attend weekly support groups. Stage 2 consisted of one 4hour session each week including stress
management, group support, exercise,


-----

cation, and counseling. Medical professionals, including a medical director, consulting cardiologist, and cardiac rehabilitation registered nurse
developed individualized programs to
help the participants return to a normal and physically active lifestyle.

The cardiac rehabilitation program
at the SwedishAmerican Health System
consisted of three phases. Phase I took
place 5 to 14 days following the coronary event and included bed exercises
and easy walking while the patient was
in the hospital. Phase II was an outpatient program which began 3 to
4 weeks after discharge from the hospital. The medical director and cardiac
rehabilitation coordinator developed
a specific exercise program for each
participant. Participants exercised
three times a week in a supervised
setting with advanced cardiac life support certified staff and electrocardiogram monitoring. Individual nutrition
consultations with a dietician were also
included in phase II. Participants were
given the option to attend phase III,
which involved exercise in a community
setting. Heart rate and blood pressure
were monitored each session.

Carotid Ultrasound Measures

The automated ultrasound methodology used in this study was described
and validated by Fritz et al.[25] Longitudinal images of the common carotid
artery were taken on both the left and
right sides using a General Electric highresolution B-mode ultrasonograph
equipped with an 8-MHz transducer.
Two certified technicians, trained by the
same individual, performed the ultrasounds. Technicians were blinded to
group allocation and time measurement. Images were recorded on a super
VHS videotape. Quality control was
regularly monitored.

Images from the super VHS videotapes were converted to digital files.
For both the left and right arteries, 10
1-cm common carotid segments were
captured from the digital video 1 cm
proximal to the common carotid
bifurcation. Every image was captured
by the same technician. Intima-media
thickness was measured at the far wall
automatically using SonoCalc computer software (Sonosite Inc., Bothell,
Washington), and the 10 measures
from the right and left sides were


combined and averaged. In some
cases the tortuosity of the internal
segment was unclear and the software
was unable to automatically identify
the intima/lumen interface. In these
cases the internal segment from the
near wall was evaluated. If neither the
far nor the near wall provided a clear
1-cm image, the measure was made
manually using the caliper process
described by Fritz et al.[25] Intimamedia thickness measures were taken
at baseline, 6 months, and
12 months.

Other Clinical Measures

Baseline measures included age,
gender, height, weight, body mass
index (BMI), income, medical history,
medications, blood pressure, total
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, blood glucose, blood triglycerides, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, ferritin, fibrinogen, diet
composition, and angina. Measures at
6 and 12 months included weight,
BMI, medications, blood lipids, blood
glucose, C-reactive protein, ferritin,


-----

fibrinogen, diet composition, program adherence, quality of life, and
angina. Medications were measured
by grouping all medications into
major classes such as cholesterol
medications, hypertensive medications, heart medications, etc. Within
each class, medication initiation or
termination was tracked and evaluated. Participants were compensated
$50 at the 6- and 12-month data
collection times. Demographic information, income, diet, adherence, and
angina were self-reported. Adherence
in this study was similar to participation. It is expressed as the percentage
of classes, exercise sessions, activities,
and support group sessions each
participant attended. Quality of selfreports was achieved through a minimal number of questions and having
a technician present during survey
completion. Venous blood samples
were taken and analyzed at SwedishAmerican Hospital’s laboratory following a 12-hour fast to obtain hemostatic
variables.

Statistical Analyses

Cross-tabulations were used to perform bivariate analyses between selected variables, with statistic significance
based on the x[2] test for independence.[26] Results are based on the
intent-to-treat method in which all
participants were retained in the analyses. When data were lost to follow-up,
the participant’s most recent available
data used the last test carry forward
method. The t-test method was used
for testing differences in means.[27]

Because multiple pairwise tests were
performed, an adjusted alpha should
be used to minimize the overall probability of committing a type I error.
The modified alpha based on the
Bonferroni correction,[28] pairwise tests,
and alpha 5 0.05 is 0.001. Statistic
significance of change scores were
evaluated using 95% confidence intervals. Change scores were significant
when they did not overlap zero. Analyses were performed using SAS version
9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North
Carolina). Procedure statements used
in SAS for assessing the data were
PROC CORR, PROC FREQ, PROC
REG, PROC TTEST, and PROC UNIVARIATE.


RESULTS

Participant age ranged from 40 to
80 years (mean 5 62; SD 5 9.1). Fiftythree men and 40 women participated
in the study. These 93 participants
were randomly assigned to the Ornish
(n 5 46) and traditional cardiac rehabilitation (n 5 47) groups (Figure 1). During the first 6 months
Ornish Program participants attended
an average of 30.27 of the 37 possible
program sessions (82%). Traditional
cardiac rehabilitation participants’
program attendance averaged 42.6
sessions out of a possible 63 exercise
sessions or 68% session attendance.

Participants were comparable at
baseline across selected clinical variables in all but the percentage of
calories in complex carbohydrates,
being higher in the Ornish group
(Table 1). The distribution of income
was similar between both groups: x[2](4)
5 2.77, p 5 .5976. There were no
significant differences in medication
use between groups at baseline.

After 6 months the Ornish group
showed significantly better improvement in weight, BMI, percentage of
calories from dietary fat, and percentage of calories from complex carbohydrates compared with the traditional
cardiac rehabilitation group. Significant improvements were observed in


both groups for weight, BMI, and
systolic blood pressure. After
12 months the Ornish group continued to show significantly better improvements in percent calories from
fat and percent calories from complex
carbohydrates. There were no differences in medication use between
groups across time. After both 6 and
12 months there were no significant
changes in intima-media thickness in
either group nor were there any
between-group differences (Table 2).

The prevalence of angina among
patients did not significantly differ at
entry into the study between Ornish and
traditional cardiac rehabilitation
groups. Eighteen of the 46 Ornish
group participants (39%) had angina at
baseline while 16 of the 47 traditional
cardiac rehabilitation group participants (33%) reported having angina at
baseline. After 6 months the number of
patients with angina in the Ornish
group dropped to four, a 78% reduction, and the number of traditional
cardiac rehabilitation group participants with angina at 6 months dropped
to 11, a 22.9% decline (x[2][3] 5 4.74, p 5
.0598). This significant between-group
difference disappeared at 12 months. At
12 months 10 Ornish group participants and 14 traditional cardiac rehabilitation group participants reported
having angina.

DISCUSSION

When compared with other lifestyle
modification programs, the Dr. Dean
Ornish Program for Reversing Heart
Disease could be considered one of the
most intense in terms of time commitment and dietary strictness. This comprehensive program attempts to simultaneously reduce an array of
cardiovascular risk factors. The results
reported here indicate that among
patients with confirmed coronary artery disease, participation in the Ornish program appears to be associated
with improved cardiovascular risk factors but no changes in carotid intimamedia thickness. Patients who participated in traditional cardiac rehabilitation also experienced no changes in
intima-media thickness.

Traditional cardiac rehabilitation is
essentially a carefully monitored cardiovascular endurance exercise program. The primary focus of cardiac
rehabilitation is aerobic conditioning
and acquisition of a lifestyle that includes regular physical activity. The
Ornish Program also includes a monitored exercise component. When the
impact of physical activity and cardiovascular endurance on intima-media
thickness has been evaluated in the past,
the results have been mixed. Some have
noted that physical activity participation
appears to be related to a thinner intima-media thickness and a lower risk of
future cardiovascular event[14,28]; however, in a 6-year clinical trial, Rauramaa et
al.[13] demonstrated that aerobic physical
exercise did not attenuate progression
of atherosclerosis except in a subgroup
of men not taking statins. A short-term
study of middle-aged men also failed to
support the hypothesis that aerobic
exercise could prevent or reduce the
age-associated increase in intima-media
thickness in healthy men.[29] The current
findings also suggest that regular aerobic exercise as offered through traditional cardiac rehabilitation or the
Ornish Program is unable to change
carotid intima-media thickness.

Comprehensive lifestyle change programs can impact several cardiovascular risk factors simultaneously. This is
important because the presence of
multiple risk factors can lead to acceleration of the atherosclerotic process.[30] Because the Ornish Program is


a comprehensive lifestyle modification
program, it has the capacity to improve
glucose tolerance, cholesterol, triglycerides, body weight, and blood pressure and modify dietary intake by
reducing saturated fats and increasing
the number of whole foods that are
abundant in phytochemicals. These
risk factors and dietary modifications
have been linked to reductions in
carotid intima-media thickness.[11–20]

Using a variety of lifestyle change
programs, several researchers have
demonstrated that progression of atherosclerosis as measured by intimamedia thickness can be reduced and
overall regression can occur.[31–33] The
Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression
Study was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled angiographic trial
of lipid-lowering therapy in subjects
with coronary artery disease.[31] Participants followed a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. Regular exercise was not part of
the intervention. Participants reduced
the annual rate of carotid wall intimamedia thickness progression by
0.13 mm/year, which was equivalent to
the maximum rate of intima-media
thickness progression observed in the
Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression
Study placebo group. A low-fat dietary
lifestyle change was able to reduce the
age-related progression in intima-media thickness, but absolute regression
was not observed. Fields et al.[32] compared the effect of a conventional diet
and exercise program and a control
group with a group of men in a multimodality intervention involving dietary, exercise, herbal food supplement,
and stress reduction approaches from
Maharishi Vedic Medicine. After 1 year
only the men who participated in the
Maharishi Vedic Medicine group
showed any signs of intima-media
thickness regression. This lifestyle intervention was especially effective on
participants with elevated health risks.
Other lifestyle interventions also appear to be effective for those who have
never smoked[15] and among postmenopausal women.[33]

Using a comprehensive lifestyle trial,
Okada et al.[34] failed to correlate
changes in total cholesterol with
changes in intima-media thickness.
Additional research is needed to ascertain if any single component of
a comprehensive lifestyle change pro

gram is responsible for the reductions
in intima-media thickness reported by
others. It is also important to note that
several trials using fluvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin alone and in conjunction with lifestyle change have also
demonstrated intima-media thickness
regression.[9,35,36] In general, these studies showed that lifestyle interventions
that include cholesterol-lowering medications have an even greater influence
on intima-media thickness than lifestyle interventions alone. Almost all of
the participants in the present study
were on statins, which may have enhanced the effect of both the cardiac
rehabilitation and Ornish programs.

Perhaps the most common criticism
of the Ornish Program is the rather
aggressive dietary restrictions it encourages. When compared with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture[37] recommendation to consume 30% of
calories from fat, the Ornish Program
recommendation to not exceed 10% of
energy from fat could be considered
extreme. Such a departure from both
normal and recommended levels of
dietary fat consumption raises questions about compliance and widespread adoption of the program. After
12 months Ornish participants in this
study were still consuming 13% of
calories from fat, while the rehabilitation group was closer to normal
(26.2%). Compliance to this strict
dietary recommendation was very
good, suggesting that for individuals
with advanced stages of cardiovascular
disease, the program is realistic and
compliance is achievable. Additional
research is needed to determine what
level of dietary fat may be therapeutic
and still be widely accepted by the
public, including those who are not
motivated by the presence of cardiovascular disease. Because both groups
were consuming relatively low
amounts of dietary fat at baseline, it is
possible that this limited the amount of
intima-media thickness regression that
could be obtained during the intervention.

In conclusion, these results suggest
that the Ornish Program may be an
effective way to improve cardiovascular
risk factors but does not appear to
impact the atherosclerotic process as
measured by carotid artery intimamedia thickness.

SO WHAT? Implications for
Practitioners and Researchers

This study suggests that the Dr.
Dean Ornish Program for Reversing
Heart Disease can improve nutrition
and reduce cardiovascular disease
risks but may not affect intimamedia thickness of the carotid artery. If this assertion holds true,
practitioners should still promote
healthy lifestyles to reduce risk. The
effects of reduced risk on vascular
tissue are still unclear.
