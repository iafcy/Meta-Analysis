                                   This clinical trial has shown that a heterogeneous group of
                                  patients [with ]coronary [heart ][disease ][can ][be ][motivated ][to]
                                  make comprehensive changes in lifestyle for at least a year
                                     outside hospital. The changes in serum lipid levels are
                                       similar to those seen with cholesterol-lowering drugs. The
