ABSTRACT
Background: Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated
with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardiovascular health.
Objective: We compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and
conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia, weight,
and plasma lipids.
Design: Free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly
assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n ¼ 49) or a diet following 2003
American Diabetes Association guidelines (conventional, n ¼ 50)
for 74 wk. Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) and plasma lipids were
assessed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74. Weight was measured at weeks 0, 22, and 74.
Results: Weight loss was significant within each diet group but not
significantly different between groups (24.4 kg in the vegan group
and 23.0 kg in the conventional diet group, P ¼ 0.25) and related
significantly to Hb A1c changes (r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.001). Hb A1c
changes from baseline to 74 wk or last available values were
20.34 and 20.14 for vegan and conventional diets, respectively
(P ¼ 0.43). Hb A1c changes from baseline to last available value
or last value before any medication adjustment were 20.40 and 0.01
for vegan and conventional diets, respectively (P ¼ 0.03). In analyses
before alterations in lipid-lowering medications, total cholesterol
decreased by 20.4 and 6.8 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional
diet groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.01); LDL cholesterol decreased by
13.5 and 3.4 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.03).
Conclusions: Both diets were associated with sustained reductions
in weight and plasma lipid concentrations. In an analysis controlling
for medication changes, a low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve
glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet
recommendations. Whether the observed differences provide clinical
benefit for the macro- or microvascular complications of diabetes
remains to be established. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov
as NCT00276939. Am J Clin Nutr 2009;89(suppl):1588S–96S.

INTRODUCTION

Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with reduced body weight, increased insulin sensitivity, and reductions
in cardiovascular risk factors (1–3). The potential cardiovascular
benefits of vegetarian and vegan diets may be especially important for individuals with diabetes, for whom cardiovascular
disease is a main cause of premature mortality; the effects of


such diets on cardiovascular risk factors appear to be similar in
individuals with and without diabetes (3).
Prior studies have shown that near-vegetarian diets reduce the
need for insulin and oral medications in individuals with type
2 diabetes (4, 5). We previously reported that in individuals with
type 2 diabetes, a low-fat, vegan diet was associated with improved
glycemic control, weight loss, and improved plasma lipid control during a 22-wk study period (6). What is particularly critical
in diabetes management is long-term improvement in clinical
measures, particularly glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors.
Well-planned low-fat vegan diets are nutritionally adequate (7)
and, in research studies, have shown acceptability comparable
with that of other therapeutic diets (8–10), suggesting they are
suitable for long-term use. We therefore followed these study
participants for an additional year and now report the effects of a
low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on 2003 American Diabetes
Association (ADA) guidelines after 74 wk of study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Participants

The study methods have been previously described (6). Briefly,
individuals with type 2 diabetes, defined by a fasting plasma
glucose concentration .125 mg/dL on 2 occasions or a prior
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes treated with medications for blood
glucose control for �6 mo, were recruited through newspaper
advertisements in the Washington, DC, area on 2 occasions
(October–December 2003 and October–December 2004) to com

-----

plete the study from January 2004 through June 2005 and January 2005 through June 2006, respectively. Exclusionary criteria
were a glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c),6.5% or .10.5%; use of
insulin for .5 y; smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse; pregnancy;
unstable medical status; and current use of a low-fat vegetarian
diet. The protocol was approved by the George Washington University Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written
informed consent.
Hb A1c was assayed with the use of affinity chromatography
on an Abbott IMx analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
IL) (11). Volunteers were ranked in order of Hb A1c concentrations and randomly assigned in sequential pairs, using a randomnumber table, to a low-fat vegan diet or a diet following 2003
ADA guidelines (12) (conventional diet group).

Intervention

The prescribed vegan diet (’10% of energy from fat, 15%
protein, 75% carbohydrate) consisted of vegetables, fruit, grains,
and legumes. Participants were asked to 1) avoid animal products
(ie, meats, dairy products, eggs); 2) avoid fatty foods, such as
added oils, fried products, avocados, nuts, and seeds; and 3)
favor low–glycemic index foods, such as beans and green vegetables. These diet changes increase dietary fiber and complex
carbohydrate at the expense of total and saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein. Portion sizes, energy intake, and
carbohydrate intake were unrestricted.
The conventional diet (15–20% protein,,7% saturated fat,
60–70% carbohydrate and monounsaturated fats; cholesterol
�200 mg/d) was individualized, based on body weight and
plasma lipid concentrations, following 2003 ADA guidelines
(12). Participants in the conventional group with a body mass
index (in kg/m[2]) .25 (all but 3 participants) were prescribed
energy intake deficits of 500–1000 kcal.
Participants were free living, and no meals were provided. To
meet thevitamin B-12 needs of thevegan group while maintaining
the same intervention in the conventional diet group, all participants were provided a vitamin B-12 supplement (100 lg) to be
taken every other day. For both groups, alcoholic beverages were
limited to 1/d for women and 2/d for men. Participants were asked
not to alter exercise habits during the first 22 wk of the study, but
they were free to alter their exercise regimens thereafter.
Each participant met for 1 h with a registered dietitian experienced in the use of the assigned diet to establish an appropriate diet plan. Thereafter, participants attended weekly 1-h
meetings of their assigned groups for nutrition and cooking instruction conducted by a physician and a registered dietitian or
a cooking instructor for 22 wk, followed by optional biweekly
sessions for an additional 52 wk. Sessions for the 2 groups
followed established curricula that were similar in duration and
content, except for dietary details.
At 7 points during the trial (weeks 4, 8, 13, 20, 33, 45, and 60),
a registered dietitian made unannounced telephone calls to each
participant to administer a 24-h diet recall, using a multipass
approach (Food and Nutrient Database 35, released May 2004,
software version 5.0; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) (13) and reported instances of
poor dietary adherence to the dietitians responsible for the
initial dietary instruction for additional dietary counseling as
needed.


In addition, a 3-d dietary record was completed by each participant at weeks 0, 11, 22, and 74 on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend
day, using a food scale, after participants had completed a 3-d
practice record.With the use ofthe NUTRITION DATA SYSTEM
FOR RESEARCH software (13), a registered dietitian certified by
the Nutrition Coordinating Center analyzed all 3-d dietary records
and diet recalls. For statistical purposes, dietary adherence for the
vegan group was defined by 3 criteria: 1) the absence of meat,
poultry, fish, dairy, or egg intake in any 24-h recalls, 3-d dietary
records, or incidentally at any point; 2) saturated fat �5% and total
fat �25% of energy on 3-d dietary records at 22 and 74 wk; and 3)
mean daily cholesterol intake �50 mg on 3-d dietary records at 22
and 74 wk. Adherence for the conventional diet group was defined,
based on the 22- and 74-wk 3-d dietary records, as 1) mean daily
energy intake �200 kcal in excess of the prescribed intake and 2)
saturated fat �10% of energy. Individuals who attended,10 of
the first 22 weekly sessions were also considered nonadherent on
either diet. These adherence criteria were used for descriptive
purposes (not for participant teaching) and were not used in the
primary outcome analysis.
Participants were asked to continue their preexisting medication regimens, except when fasting plasma glucose determinations were,80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L) or hypoglycemic symptoms
were accompanied by a capillary glucose reading,65 mg/dL
(3.6 mmol/L). In such cases, medications were reduced for
participant safety by a study endocrinologist who remained blind
to group assignment. Dosage adjustments followed an established
protocol, which generally called for 20% dosage reductions for
participants treated with insulin and 50% dosage reductions for
participants on oral agents. For those individuals for whom Hb
A1c at 22 wk was .8%, a single medication adjustment was
made, based on an established protocol, as follows: 1) participants on insulin were prescribed a 10–20% increased dose, 2)
participants treated with oral agents could be raised to the maximal recommended dosages, and 3) participants on no medications were prescribed 2 mg/d glimepiride. Because medication
changes confound the interpretation of the effect of diet on glycemia, analyses were designed to account for this factor to the
extent possible, as described below.

Outcome measures

Laboratory measurements were made after a 12-h fast by
technicians blind to group assignment. Hb A1c, plasma glucose,
and plasma lipids were assayed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61,
and 74. All other measures were assessed at weeks 0, 22, and 74,
except as noted. Plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and
urinary albumin were measured with the use of laboratory
methods previously described (6).
Physical activity was assessed over 3-d periods at weeks 0, 22,
and 74 by pedometer (Omron HJ-112; Omron Healthcare Inc,
Bannockburn, IL) and with the Bouchard 3-Day Physical Activity Record (14). At weeks 1, 11, 22, and 74, body weight,
waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure were measured
as previously described (6).

Statistical analyses

To have an 80% chance of detecting as significant (at the
2-sided 5% level) a 1.5-point between-group Hb A1c difference,


-----

with an assumed SD of 1.9 and a loss to follow-up of 26%, 34
participants were required per group. An interim analysis indicated group differences of 0.8 with SD of 1.3, so a revised
power analysis was conducted. To have an 80% chance of detecting a 0.8 difference as significant with an SD of 1.3 and loss
to follow-up of 33%, an additional 15 participants were required
per group. Data for the 2 cohorts were combined, such that the
74-wk observations were collected 74 wk after baseline determinations for all participants.
The primary analysis of Hb A1c included all participants based
on intention to treat. Repeated-measures analysis of variance
was performed to see whether there were effects associated with
time (within-person variable), diet group (between-group variable), or the interaction of time and diet group. The dependent
variable for the repeated-measures analysis was the Hb A1c
value at baseline and weeks 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74.
Between-subjects t tests were calculated for Hb A1c, and all
other dependent measures to determine whether changes associated with the intervention diet were greater than those associated with the control diet. Within each diet group, paired
comparison t tests were calculated to test whether the change
from baseline to 74 wk, or last available value, was significantly
different from zero. In cases of missing Hb A1c values, the last
available values were brought forward. Because medication
changes influence the dependent measures, additional analyses
were done by carrying forward the last values before any
medication changes for individuals whose medications for glucose or lipid control had changed, and by limiting the analysis to
individuals with no medication changes. For body weight, additional analyses were conducted with the use of baseline
weights for missing values. An a of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
Regression analyses assessed whether the diet group effects
on Hb A1c and body weight were significant while controlling
for baseline values, and whether the diet group effect on Hb
A1c was significant while controlling for baseline Hb A1c and
changes in body weight. Pearson’s correlation coefficients
were calculated for the relation between HB A1c change and
weight change. Between-group differences in diet adherence
were analyzed with the use of the chi-square test. The software
used was SAS for Windows, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Of 1049 individuals screened by telephone, 99 met participation criteria and were randomly assigned to the vegan (n ¼ 49)
or conventional diet (n ¼ 50) groups. Reasons for exclusion
were Hb A1c values outside the required range (n ¼ 201), failure
to meet other participation criteria (n ¼ 279), inability to attend
scheduled meetings (n ¼ 187), failure to keep interview appointment (n ¼ 153), reluctance to change diet (n ¼ 72), and
other or unspecified (n ¼ 58). Demographic characteristics reflected those of the Washington, DC, area (Table 1). Seven
vegan and 5 conventional diet participants failed to complete 74wk laboratory assessments. Nine vegan and 7 conventional diet
participants failed to complete 74-wk dietary records. No significant baseline clinical or demographic differences were observed between these individuals and study completers.


Dietary intake, adherence, and medication changes

Both groups reduced energy intake (Table 2). The decreases in
total, saturated, monounsaturated, and trans fat intake and in
cholesterol intake, expressed in relation to energy intake, were
significantly greater in the vegan group. Carbohydrate and fiber
intakes increased in the vegan group, with smaller changes in
these variables in the conventional diet group. For micronutrients, compared with the conventional diet group, the vegan
group reported greater increases in vitamin C, folate, magnesium, and iron intakes and greater reductions in vitamin D,
calcium, and zinc intakes. Increases in fruit and vegetable intake
were greater in the vegan group. Pedometer readings and selfreported energy expenditure showed no significant betweengroup differences. At 22 wk, all group-specific dietary adherence
criteria were met by 67% (33 of 49) of participants in the vegan
group and 44% (22 of 50) of participants in the conventional diet
group. At 74 wk, all dietary adherence criteria were met by 51%
(25 of 49) of participants in the vegan group and 48% (24 of 50)
of participants in the conventional diet group.
During the 74-wk study period, 71% (35 of 49) of participants
in the vegan group and 58% (29 of 50) of participants in the
conventional diet group altered their diabetes medications, either
as prescribed by the study protocol or without investigators’
authorization. Net 74-wk dosages were reduced in 17 (35%)
participants in the vegan group and 10 (20%) participants in the
conventional diet group, were increased in 7 (14%) participants in
the vegan group and 12 (24%) participants in the conventional
diet group, and were unchanged or mixed (changes in opposite
directions in �2 medications) in the remainder.

Body weight

When data from all participants from baseline to 74 wk or last
available value were included, both diets were associated with
significant sustained weight reduction (24.4 kg in the vegan group
and 23.0 kg in the conventional diet group), with no significant
difference between groups (P ¼ 0.25) (Table 3). Using baseline
values for missing values did not substantially change the outcome (vegan group: 23.7 kg; conventional diet group: 22.6 kg;
between-group P ¼ 0.36). Limiting the analysis to participants
who met dietary adherence criteria at 22 and 74 wk (21 vegan, 16
conventional), weight loss was 6.8 kg in the vegan group and 4.9
kg in the conventional diet group (P ¼ 0.45).

Glycemic control

For Hb A1c, the repeated-measures analysis of variance
showed significant effects for time (P, 0.0001) and for diet
group-by-time interaction (P ¼ 0.03). The effects for time were
both linear and curvilinear. The group-by-time interaction was
followed with t test comparisons between groups for changes
from baseline to 74 wk. In an intention-to-treat analysis, including all participants without regard to medication adjustments, Hb A1c changes from baseline to 74 wk or to the last
available value were 20.34 for the vegan group and 20.14 for
the conventional diet group (P ¼ 0.43) (Table 3).
In an effort to remove the confounding effect of medication
changes, 2 additional analyses were conducted. Hb A1c changes
from baseline to 74 wk or to the last available value before any
medication adjustment were 20.40 and 0.01 in vegan and
conventional diet groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.03) (Table 4;

Figure 1). Among 74-wk completers whose medications remained unchanged throughout (14 vegan, 21 conventional), Hb
A1c changes were 20.82 (vegan; within-group P ¼ 0.04) and
20.21 (conventional; within-group P ¼ 0.35) (P ¼ 0.14).
A regression model was constructed that included baseline Hb
A1c, weight change, and diet group as predictors of Hb A1c
change from baseline to 74 wk or last available value. In this
model, baseline Hb A1c (P, 0.0001) and weight change (P ¼
0.007) were associated with Hb A1c change, but the effect of diet
group was no longer significant (P ¼ 0.12).
Controlling for diet group and baseline Hb A1c values, weight
change was significantly associated with Hb A1c change; each
kilogram of weight loss was associated with a 0.09 decrease in
Hb A1c. For the subgroup with no net change in diabetes medications (n ¼ 41), the Pearson’s correlation of weight change
with Hb A1c change was r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.001.

Plasma lipids

Reductions in total, LDL-, and non–HDL-cholesterol concentrations from baseline to 74 wk (or to last available value)


were observed for both groups, as were reductions in triglyceride
and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations in the vegan group, with no
between-group differences in intention-to-treat analyses (Table
3). In analyses adjusted for medication changes, reductions in
LDL and non-HDL cholesterol were significantly greater in the
vegan group (Table 4). No treatment-related serious adverse
events were observed.

DISCUSSION

In this 74-wk study, both diets were associated with significant
weight loss. In analyses including all participants without regard
to medication changes, both diets were associated with reductions
in Hb A1c; the mean change was slightly but not significantly
greater in the vegan group. In analyses controlling for medication changes, significantly greater reductions were seen in Hb
A1c values and in total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in
the vegan group.
Much of the effect of the intervention diets on glycemia
appears to be mediated by weight reduction. However, the 2 diets
appear to have altered energy intake by different mechanisms.

Although overweight individuals in the conventional diet group
were prescribed an explicit energy deficit, a low-fat vegan diet
typically elicits significant weight loss in the absence of prescribed energy intake limits (2). This is likely because reduced
dietary fat and increased dietary fiber reduce dietary energy
density (15, 16).
Individuals following self-selected plant-based diets typically
have lower body weights, compared with omnivores (17). In a US
Department of Agriculture survey of 10,014 adults, vegetarians
and individuals on high-carbohydrate, low-fat diets had the
lowest body mass indexes of the groups studied (18). In clinical
trials, the use of plant-based diets is associated with weight reduction that is partially preserved over the long term. In a study
that used a low-fat vegan diet without added exercise in overweight postmenopausal women, median weight reduction was
4.9 kg at 1 y and 3.1 kg at 2 y, both of which were greater than
weight changes associated with a comparison diet based on the
National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (19). Among
individuals with cardiac disease, a lifestyle program that included
a low-fat vegetarian diet and mild exercise was associated with
net weight loss of 10.9 kg at 1 y and 5.8 kg at 5 y (20).
A vegan diet may also be associated with reductions in
intramyocellular lipid, which is strongly associated with insulin


sensitivity (21). A case-control study found that the median
soleus muscle intramyocellular lipid concentration was 31%
lower in a group of 21 vegans compared with 25 omnivores
matched for age and body weight (P ¼ 0.01) (22).
The long-term effect of both diet interventions on glycemia
was reduced in comparison with the short-term findings from this
study (6). Among participants in the vegan group with no
changes to diabetes medications, Hb A1c had fallen 1.23 by 22
wk (n ¼ 24) and 0.82 by 74 wk (n ¼ 14). Among medicationstable participants in the conventional diet group, the Hb A1c
reduction was 0.38 at 22 wk (n ¼ 33), and 0.21 (n ¼ 21) at 74
wk. Both groups retained most of their weight loss, suggesting
that their diets had not returned to their baseline patterns.
The principal diet change in the conventional diet group was
a reduction in energy intake, which appears to be due to reduced
portion sizes rather than to changes in macronutrient balance,
which was close to the recommended percentages for protein,
carbohydrate, and monounsaturated fat at baseline and changed
only slightly during the study. This change in energy intake was
nonetheless sufficient to lead to sustained weight loss. Several
studies that used conventional diets (23–26) have reported more
dramatic Hb A1c reductions (0.5–1.9%) than were observed in
the conventional diet group in our study. However, each of those

studies lasted �6 mo, and none accounted for medication alterations or dropouts in reports of Hb A1c changes. The current
study was approximately 1 y longer than prior studies, and
during this time changes in medications are likely to occur. We
have therefore taken steps to report results both with and without
accounting for medication changes. Our participant population
had had diabetes for .8 years, on average, before study entry.

Vegetarian and vegan diets are often more effective than other
diets for lipid control (27), an important consideration, given that
coronary heart disease is the main cause of mortality in diabetes.
The reduction in triglycerides associated with the vegan diet
contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that diets high in refined
carbohydrate may transiently increase triglyceride concentrations for some individuals (2, 28). It appears that high-fiber,
low–glycemic index foods, such as were used in the present
study, have a salutary effect on triglyceride concentrations (29),
and the observed weight loss may also have contributed to triglyceride reductions.
The acceptability of low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets has
been shown to be similar to that of other therapeutic diets in
studies of individuals with cardiovascular disease (8), young women
with dysmenorrhea (9), overweight but otherwise healthy postmenopausal women (10), and the current study population (30).
Although low-fat vegan diets are generally lower in fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol and higher in fiber and complex carbohydrate, compared with omnivorous diets (31, 32), planning is
important for micronutrient adequacy, particularly for sources of
vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and calcium (7).
The study’s strengths include its randomized design, extended
duration, inclusion of individuals with long-standing diabetes,
analysis of dependent measures without regard to variations in
dietary adherence, statistical methods aimed at reducing the
effect of medication changes, and applicability outside the research setting. The study also has weaknesses. The medication
changes required for patient safety or for appropriate medical


-----

management present a challenge in outpatient diabetes studies of
more than a few months’ duration. In the present study, most
participants in both groups altered medications, often because of
clinical success (low blood glucose values), presenting a confounding variable that required special analyses. Carrying forward the last value before any medication change, as in the
current study, may either under- or overestimate effects (33, 34).
Limiting the analysis to those with no medication changes reduces sample size and statistical power. It is reassuring that all
statistical models (repeated-measures analysis, use of final data
from all participants without regard to medication use or dietary
adherence, and use of the last value before medication change)
led to similar conclusions, showing a mean long-term Hb A1c–
lowering effect ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 units for the vegan group
and from 0 to 0.1 for the conventional diet group. Moreover, the
persistent mean weight loss confirms the participants’ reports
that dietary changes were at least partially maintained.
In conclusion, in individuals with type 2 diabetes participating
in a research study, both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on
2003 ADA guidelines facilitated long-term weight reduction. In
analyses controlling for medication changes, the vegan diet
appeared to be more effective for control of glycemia and plasma
lipid concentrations. Whether the observed differences provide
clinical benefit for the macro- or microvascular complications of
diabetes remains to be established. (Other articles in this supplement to the Journal include references 35–61.)
