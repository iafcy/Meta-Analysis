ABSTRACT 
Background Although vegan diets improve diabetes man- 
agement, little is known about the nutrient proﬁles or 
diet quality of individuals with type 2 diabetes who adopt 
a vegan diet. 
Objective To assess the changes in nutrient intake and 
dietary quality among participants following a low-fat 
vegan diet or the 2003 American Diabetes Association 
dietary recommendations.

Design A 22-week randomized, controlled clinical trial ex- 
amining changes in nutrient intake and diet quality. 
Subjects/setting Participants with type 2 diabetes (n(cid:1)99) 
in a free-living setting. 
Research design and methods Participants were randomly 
assigned to a low-fat vegan diet or a 2003 American 
Diabetes Association recommended diet. 
Main outcome measures Nutrient 
intake and Alternate 
Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores were collected at 
baseline and 22 weeks. 
Statistical analyses performed Between-group t tests were 
calculated for changes between groups and paired com- 
parison t tests were calculated for changes within-group. 
Pearson’s correlation assessed relationship of AHEI score 
to hemoglobin A1c and body weight changes. 
Results Both groups reported signiﬁcant decreases in en- 
ergy, protein, fat, cholesterol, vitamin D, selenium, and 
sodium intakes. The vegan group also signiﬁcantly re- 
duced reported intakes of vitamin B-12 and calcium, and 
signiﬁcantly increased carbohydrate, ﬁber, total vitamin 
A activity, beta carotene, vitamins K and C, folate, mag- 
nesium, and potassium. The American Diabetes Associa- 
tion recommended diet group also reported signiﬁcant 
decreases in carbohydrate and iron, but reported no sig- 
im- 
niﬁcant 
proved its AHEI score (P(cid:2)0.0001), while the American 
Diabetes Association recommended diet group did not 
(P(cid:1)0.7218). The difference in AHEI score at 22 weeks 
between groups was signiﬁcant (P(cid:2)0.0001). With both 
groups combined, AHEI score was negatively correlated 
with both changes in hemoglobin A1c value (r(cid:1)– 0.24, 
P(cid:1)0.016) and weight (r(cid:1)– 0.27, P(cid:1)0.007). 
Conclusions Vegan diets increase intakes of carbohydrate, 
ﬁber, and several micronutrients, in contrast with the 
American Diabetes Association recommended diet. The 
vegan group improved its AHEI score whereas the Amer- 
ican Diabetes Association recommended diet group’s 
AHEI score remained unchanged.

some cancers (1-5), heart disease (6), type 2 diabetes 
(4,7), and overweight (8,9). Most research on the 
nutrient intake of vegetarian diets has focused on self- 
selected, long-term vegetarians. Less is known about the 
nutritional changes of individuals during the transition 
to a vegetarian or vegan diet. Furthermore, because a 
vegetarian or vegan diet has been shown to be helpful in 
managing diabetes (10,11) and heart disease (2), as well 
as reducing plasma cholesterol concentrations (11,12) 
and body weight (13), it is important to assess the nutri- 
ent effects of such a diet in comparison with more con- 
ventional therapeutic regimens used for these conditions. 
The nutrient intake of individuals adopting a therapeutic 
vegan diet has been studied in clinical trials related to 
prostate cancer (14), weight loss (15), and heart disease/ 
cholesterol-lowering (2,11). Little is known about the nu- 
trient proﬁles of individuals with diabetes adopting a 
low-fat vegan diet and how this diet’s nutrient proﬁle 
compares to the dietary recommendations set forth by the 
American Diabetes Association (16) for people with type 2 
diabetes. 
The overall diet quality of vegan diets compared to 
other therapeutic diets has not been measured. Several 
diet quality indexes are available, including the Healthy 
Eating Index (HEI) (17), Recommended Food Score (18), 
and the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) (19). 
These indexes estimate chronic disease risk based on 
several dietary behaviors. The HEI, one of the ﬁrst and 
most widely used indexes of overall healthful nutrition, is 
only weakly correlated with chronic disease risk (20,21). 
Therefore, researchers have developed alternatives to the 
HEI. The AHEI has been shown to be a better predictor of 
risk of cardiovascular disease and other major chronic 
diseases (22), compared with the HEI, and a better pre- 
dictor of the occurrence of inﬂammation (23) than the 
HEI or Recommended Food Score. The AHEI is a nine 
component dietary index used to rate foods and macro- 
nutrients related to chronic disease risk. Using dietary 
intake, researchers can use the AHEI to produce a di- 
etary score ranging from 2.5 to 87.5 (19). 
Therefore, a group of individuals with type 2 diabetes 
who followed a low-fat, vegan diet or the 2003 dietary 
recommendations of the American Diabetes Association 
was studied. Because a vegan diet has been shown to be 
effective in the treatment of diabetes (10), it is therefore 
important to examine the nutrient adequacy and quality 
of this diet. A diet used to treat one chronic disease (eg, 
type 2 diabetes) should ideally be effective at preventing 
other chronic diseases (eg, cardiovascular disease) as well 
and should also provide adequate macro- and micronutri- 
ents. The goal of this research was to examine the nutri- 
tional adequacy and quality of a low-fat vegan diet com- 
pared to the dietary recommendations of the American 
Diabetes Association. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Participants 
The methods have been described elsewhere (10). Brieﬂy, 
99 men and women with type 2 diabetes (fasting plasma 
glucose concentration (cid:3)124.2 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) on two 
occasions or a prior diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with the 
use of hypoglycemic medications for (cid:1)6 months) were 
recruited to participate in a study examining the effect of 
a low-fat, low-glycemic-index vegan diet on hemoglobin 
A1c levels. Participants were recruited through newspa- 
per advertisements in the Washington, DC, area. Exclu- 
sion criteria included a hemoglobin A1c level of (cid:2)6.5% or 
(cid:3)10.5%, current smoking, drug or alcohol abuse, insulin 
use (cid:3)5 years, pregnancy, current use of a low-fat vege- 
tarian diet, or an unstable medical status. The study 
protocol was approved by the George Washington Univer- 
sity Institutional Review Board and all participants pro- 
vided written, informed consent. 
Diets, Assessment, and Instruction 
Participants were randomly assigned to the vegan diet or 
a diet that followed 2003 American Diabetes Association 
guidelines. The vegan diet consisted of grains, fruit, veg- 
etables, and legumes. Participants were instructed to 
avoid animal products, limit high-fat foods, and favor 
foods with a low glycemic index value. There were no 
restrictions on portion sizes or energy intake. 
The American Diabetes Association diet was individu- 
alized, based on body weight and lipid proﬁle, according 
to 2003 American Diabetes Association guidelines. Amer- 
ican Diabetes Association participants who were over- 
weight (body mass index (cid:1)25) were prescribed a diet with 
an energy deﬁcit of 500 to 1,000 kcal. The exchange 
system was used to provide the recommended energy and 
carbohydrate and saturated fat grams each participant 
required. Each meal plan was individualized to the par- 
ticipant’s current food and eating habits. Neither group 
received prepared meals. Rather, participants prepared 
foods at home and/or ate at restaurants. Participants 
were asked to maintain baseline levels of physical activ- 
ity for 22 weeks. 
Before randomization, participants completed a prac- 
tice 3-day weighed dietary record that included 1 week- 
end day and 2 weekdays, which was reviewed by a regis- 
tered dietitian (RD). Participants then completed a 
baseline food record. After randomization, participants 
met individually with an RD experienced in the use of the 
assigned diet to develop individualized meal plans. Par- 
ticipants then met with their assigned diet groups, led by 
an RD and physician, each week for 1 hour for discus- 
sions, cooking demonstrations, and meal planning. Meet- 
ing topics were similar for both groups and included tips 
on eating out, healthful cooking ideas, ﬁnding support 
from friends and family, grocery store tours, and prob- 
lem-solving activities. Meetings continued for 22 weeks. 
Participants completed additional 3-day dietary records 
at 11 and 22 weeks. All participants were provided with a 
vitamin B-12 supplement (100 (cid:2)g) to be taken every other 
day and were asked to limit alcohol intake to two drinks 
per day for men or one drink per day for women. Partic- 
ipants were asked if they had regularly taken their vita- 
min B-12 supplement when they were called on their last 
dietary recall. 
Dietary Adherence 
Adherence to the diet was assessed based on 22-week 
dietary records and 24-hour recalls that were conducted 


by telephone by an RD at Week 4, 8, 13, and 20 (one per 
week). Participants were unaware of when the calls were 
going to be made. The study RD used the multiple-pass 
method to collect the recalls. Vegan participants were 
considered adherent if they reported an absence of ani- 
mal products on recalls and 22-week food records, as well 
as saturated fat intake (cid:3)5% of energy, total fat intake 
(cid:3)25%, and cholesterol intake of (cid:3)50 mg on their 22-week 
food records. American Diabetes Association diet partic- 
ipants were considered adherent if they had an average 
daily energy intake of no more than 200 kcal in excess of 
their prescribed intakes and saturated fat intake (cid:3)10% of 
energy on their 22-week food records. Individuals who 
attended fewer than 10 of the 22 weekly meetings were 
considered nonadherent on either diet. A Nutrition Coor- 
dinating Center-certiﬁed RD analyzed all 3-day dietary 
records and diet recalls using Nutrition Data System for 
Research software version 5.0 (Food and Nutrient Data- 
base 35, 2004, Nutrition Coordinating Center, University 
of Minnesota, Minneapolis) (24). Quality control was con- 
ducted for both the dietary records and recalls. For the 
food records, a second RD reviewed the food records 
compared to what was entered into the nutrient data- 
base. Discrepancies were addressed and missing foods 
were added. A second RD also reviewed the dietary 
recalls for any data entry issues related to portion sizes 
or amounts. 
Nutrient Intake and Other Measures 
Nutrient intake at baseline and 22 weeks was calculated 
from the 3-day food records, averaging values for each 
3-day period. AHEI scores were calculated for each par- 
ticipant based on food categories, including vegetables 
(servings per day), fruit (servings per day), nuts and soy 
protein (servings per day), ratio of white to red meat 
(grams), cereal ﬁber (grams per day), trans fat (percent of 
energy), and ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty 
acids (grams). Each of these categories received a score 
ranging from zero to 10 (19). Although baseline multivi- 
tamin use was obtained, duration of multivitamin use 
was not and supplement use was not collected at 22 
weeks. Alcohol use was not included in the analysis, 
because both groups received the same recommendations 
(ie, limiting alcohol intake to one drink or equivalent per 
day for women and two per day for men). These variables 
were not expected to vary according to diet group. Dietary 
supplement use was excluded from both the nutrient and 
AHEI analyses. 
Other measures, such as demographic data, hemoglo- 
bin A1c, lipid levels, blood pressure, urinary albumin, 
weight, medication use, hip and waist circumference, and 
physical activity, were measured at baseline and 22 
weeks and have been reported elsewhere (10). Hemoglo- 
bin A1c was obtained after a 12-hour fast and was as- 
sayed at baseline, 11 weeks, and 22 weeks. At the same 
time points, body weight was determined in a paper 
gown, without shoes using a digital scale accurate to 0.1 
kg. During the 22-week study, the research endocrinolo- 
gist adjusted diabetes medications in cases of hypoglyce- 
mia, as previously reported (10). 


Statistical Methods 
A power analysis was conducted using an 80% chance of 
detecting a signiﬁcant 1.5% between-group difference in 
hemoglobin A1c and revealed a need for 49 participants 
per group. Between-group t tests were calculated for each 
measure to determine whether the changes associated 
with the vegan diet were different than those associated 
with the American Diabetes Association diet. Within each 
diet group, paired comparison t tests were calculated to 
test whether the changes from baseline to 22 weeks were 
signiﬁcantly different from zero. The primary analysis of 
the main endpoint was based on intention-to-treat and 
included all participants. In cases where participants did 
not complete 22-week dietary records, baseline values 
were brought forward. An (cid:4) of .05 was used for all sta- 
tistical tests, with no adjustment for multiple compari- 
sons. Pearson’s correlation assessed whether changes in 
AHEI score were signiﬁcantly correlated with hemoglo- 
bin A1c and body weight changes for all participants 
together and for each diet group. SAS was used for all 
analyses (version 8.2, 2001, SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, 
NC). 
RESULTS 
Of 1,049 individuals screened by telephone, 99 met par- 
ticipation criteria. Of these participants, 49 were ran- 
domly assigned to the vegan group and 50 were assigned 
to the American Diabetes Association diet group. Base- 
line demographic information is reported in Table 1. At 
22 weeks, complete nutrient data were available for 46 
vegan participants and 42 American Diabetes Associa- 
tion diet group participants. An analysis limited to study 
completers did not substantially change the outcomes. 
Adherence and medication changes and changes in he- 
moglobin A1c level and weight during the 22-week study 
are described elsewhere (10). Brieﬂy, criteria for dietary 
adherence were met by 33 vegan (67%) and 22 American 
Diabetes Association ADbA diet (44%) participants. Dia- 
betes medication changes (primarily because of hypogly- 
cemia) were reported by 21 vegan (43%) and 13 American 
Diabetes Association diet (26%) participants. Among all 
participants, hemoglobin A1c value dropped 0.96 percent- 
age points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the 
American Diabetes Association diet group (P(cid:1)0.089). 
Among those participants without a medication change, 
the vegan group saw a signiﬁcant decrease in hemoglobin 
A1c value compared to the American Diabetes Associa- 
tion group ((cid:4)1.23 vs (cid:4)0.38 points, respectively; P(cid:1)0.01). 
There was also a signiﬁcant decrease in weight among 
the vegan group as compared to the American Diabetes 
Association diet group ((cid:4)6.5 kg vs (cid:4)3.1 kg, respectively; 
P(cid:2)0.01). 
Nutrient Intake at Baseline and 22 Weeks 
There was no signiﬁcant difference in nutrient intake 
between groups at baseline. The vegan group reduced 
mean reported intake of energy, protein, fat (total, satu- 
rated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans), 
cholesterol, vitamins D and B-12, calcium, selenium, and 
sodium. The group increased mean reported intake of 
carbohydrate, soluble and insoluble ﬁber, total vitamin A

activity, beta carotene, vitamins C and K, folate, magne- 
sium, and potassium. The American Diabetes Association 
diet group reported signiﬁcant reductions in energy, car- 
bohydrate, protein, fat (total, saturated, monounsatu- 
rated, polyunsaturated, and trans), cholesterol, vitamin 
D, iron, selenium, and sodium. The American Diabetes 
Association diet group reported no signiﬁcant increases 
in intake of any measured nutrient (Table 2). 
The vegan group reduced its reported mean intake of 
total fat, trans fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty 
acid, protein, cholesterol, and vitamin D to a greater 
degree than did the American Diabetes Association diet 
group (Table 2). There were also signiﬁcant differences 
for carbohydrate, soluble and insoluble ﬁber, total vita- 
min A activity and beta carotene, folate, magnesium, 
iron, potassium, with the vegan group increasing intakes 
of these nutrients and the American Diabetes Association 
diet group decreasing or having no change in intakes. The 
vegan group increased vitamin C to a greater degree than 
did the American Diabetes Association diet group and the 
American Diabetes Association diet group reduced so- 
dium intake to a greater degree, compared to the vegan 
group. There were no signiﬁcant differences in changes in 
energy, polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), vitamins E, 
K, B-6, and B-12, calcium, zinc, or selenium intake be- 
tween groups. 
To assess whether vegan and American Diabetes Asso- 
ciation diet participants were meeting current Dietary 
Reference Intakes (DRI), 22-week data were divided by 
sex and compared to the DRI for the 51- to 70-year age 
reference group (Table 3). Both groups met recommended 
intakes for protein based on Estimated Average Require- 
ment and (cid:1)10% of total energy. Male and female vegan 
participants met Adequate Intakes for dietary ﬁber (30 
g/day for men and 21 g/day for women) but the American 
Diabetes Association diet group did not. Both groups met 
DRI recommendations for vitamins A, K, C, B-6, and 
folate, iron, and selenium. Both male and female Ameri- 
can Diabetes Association diet members and female vegan 
members met vitamin B-12 recommendations with vegan 
men consuming slightly less than recommended values 
(2.1(cid:5)2.4 (cid:2)g/day). Men and women in the vegan group did 
not meet zinc requirements whereas American Diabetes 
Association diet participants did. For magnesium, only 
female vegan participants met recommended intakes. 
Neither group met the DRI for vitamins D or E, calcium, 
or potassium and both groups exceeded the sodium rec- 
ommendations. 
AHEI 
The vegan group improved in every AHEI food category, 
including signiﬁcant increases in vegetable, fruit, nut and 
soy protein, and cereal ﬁber intakes; a decrease in trans 
fat intake; and an increase in the PUFA-to-saturated fat 
ratio (Table 4). These results were reﬂected in AHEI 
score categories as well. The American Diabetes Associ- 
ation diet group showed changes in one food group (in-

creased PUFA-to-saturated fat ratio) and two AHEI score 
categories (increases in nuts and soy protein and PUFA- 
to-saturated fat ratio scores). Both groups reduced their 
white meat to red meat ratio (only signiﬁcantly in the 
vegan group, largely reﬂecting a reduction in overall 
meat intake). 
The vegan group had greater improvements in all 
AHEI categories and serving amounts, compared with 
the American Diabetes Association diet group, with the 
exception of the nuts and soy protein category. The vegan 
group signiﬁcantly improved its overall AHEI score, 
while the American Diabetes Association group did not 
(P(cid:2)0.001). 
For all participants combined, AHEI score was nega- 
tively correlated with both changes in hemoglobin A1c 
(r(cid:1)– 0.24, P(cid:2)0.05) and weight (r(cid:1)– 0.27, P(cid:2)0.01). That 
is, an increase in AHEI score was associated with de- 
creases in both hemoglobin A1c value and weight. There 
was no within-group correlation between AHEI score 
changes and changes in hemoglobin A1c value (vegan: 
r(cid:1)– 0.18176, P(cid:1)0.211; American Diabetes Association: 
r(cid:1)– 0.17707, P(cid:1)0.219) or changes in weight (vegan: r(cid:1)– 
0.23318, P(cid:1)0.107 and American Diabetes Association: 
r(cid:1)– 0.19098, P(cid:1)0.184). 
Although alcohol use was excluded from the dietary 
quality analyses, study participants reported little alco- 
hol use on average. At 22 weeks, average alcohol intake 
for the vegan and American Diabetes Association diet 
respectively, 
groups 
P(cid:1)0.9062) was well below the quantities receiving the 
highest AHEI scores (1.5 to 2.5 drinks per day—about 
22.5 to 37.5 g/day—for men and 0.5 to 1.5 drinks per 
day—7.5 to 22.5 g/day—for women). 

DISCUSSION 
Nutrient Intake 
Past studies have shown that vegan diets have a high 
degree of acceptability among participants, with partici- 
pants ﬁnding a vegan diet as acceptable as their usual 
intake (25) or as compared to a standard low-fat diet (26). 
Although both groups reduced their energy intake, they 
had very different micronutrient proﬁles. With the excep- 
tion of carbohydrate, both groups reported similar 
changes in macronutrient intake— decreasing fats and 
protein intake—although to a greater degree in the vegan 
group. The small reported average cholesterol intake in 
the vegan group (45.4 mg/day) was partly attributable to 
small amounts of animal products consumed by some 
participants who were not fully adherent to the diet, as 
well as the fact that the Nutrient Data System for Re- 
search database may report small amounts of cholesterol 
in foods (eg, bread or pasta) that, in fact, may have had 
none. Similar nutrient changes were found in a study 
comparing the intakes of women following a low-fat 
vegan diet for 14 weeks to a low-fat diet based on Na- 
tional Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (similar 
to the current Therapeutic Lifestyle Change diet recom- 
mendations) (15). 
In contrast to studies suggesting inadequate vitamin 
B-12 intake among some vegan groups (27,28), this study 
found that mean vitamin B-12 intake remained within 
the recommended range even without considering dietary 
supplements. This is most likely due to the inclusion of 
foods fortiﬁed with vitamin B-12 such as cereals and 
soymilks. Despite the popular expectation that vegan and 
vegetarian diets are low in iron, these ﬁndings conﬁrm 
those of other studies that vegans may have higher in- 
takes of iron when compared with omnivores (27). The 
iron that the vegan group was consuming at 22 weeks 
was, however, all in the nonheme form and therefore may 
not be as bioavailable as heme iron. Both groups de- 
creased vitamin D intake, with the vegan group having a 
greater drop. Other studies have also found a low intake 
of vitamin D among those following a vegan diet (14,15). 
Both groups were well below current vitamin D recom- 
mendations before beginning their assigned diets as well 
as at the 22-week time point. 
Regarding intakes of vitamins D and E, calcium, and 
potassium, our ﬁndings suggest that people following ei- 
ther a low-fat, low-glycemic index vegan diet or an Amer- 
ican Diabetes Association recommended diet may wish to 
pay particular attention to these nutrients to ensure they 
meet their needs. Men and women following an American 
Diabetes Association recommended diet and men follow- 
ing a low-fat vegan diet may also wish to increase their 
intake of magnesium by including more fruits, vegeta- 
bles, and whole grains. Because carbohydrate intake is 
restricted in the American Diabetes Association recom- 
mended diet, it is important that high-ﬁber carbohy- 
drates be emphasized to meet ﬁber recommendations. 
People following a vegan diet may wish to emphasize 
foods rich in zinc to ensure they meet their needs. 
The 2003 American Diabetes Association Guidelines, 
which were current at the time of study implementation, 
were used with American Diabetes Association diet group 
participants. Since then, the 2007 guidelines have been 
released (29). These guidelines have many similarities to 
the 2003 guidelines but there are some changes that may 
have inﬂuenced the nutrient intake of the American Di- 
abetes Association diet group. Fiber has a greater empha- 
sis in the updated diet recommendations. People with 
diabetes are encouraged to consume 14 g ﬁber per 1,000 
kcal per day and have half of daily grain intake come from 
whole grains. Although Glycemic Index and Glycemic 
Load are not recommended as necessary components of 
healthful diet planning, the guidelines do state that use 
of Glycemic Index and Glycemic Load may provide a 
slight additional beneﬁt over considering carbohydrate 
content alone. Finally, the 2007 American Diabetes As- 
sociation guidelines state that everyone with diabetes 
should consume a diet with (cid:2)200 mg cholesterol/day, 
whereas 2003 guidelines only recommended this level to 
those with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels (29). 
AHEI 
The AHEI is strongly negatively associated with risk of 
major chronic diseases and cardiovascular disease but 
not most cancers (19). The AHEI has been shown to have 
an inverse relationship with estrogen receptor-negative 
breast cancer (30) but not genetically linked (ie, BRCA 
gene-associated) breast cancer (31). We found that AHEI 
score was negatively correlated with changes in hemoglo- 
bin A1c value and weight. Similar results were found in a 
study examining AHEI score and women with type 2 


diabetes revealing that AHEI score was inversely corre- 
lated with the risk for type 2 diabetes (32). 
Both groups reduced their white-meat-to-red-meat ra- 
tio, as scored by the AHEI. This does not necessarily 
reﬂect an increase in red meat intake in both groups. 
According to the AHEI scoring criteria, an individual who 
ate no meat at all (receiving a ratio of zero) or who ate less 
than two servings of meat in 1 month (equivalent to (cid:3)5.7 
g/day) would receive the highest AHEI score for that 
category. Therefore, for many participants, a decrease in 
their white-meat-to-red-meat ratio reﬂected a decrease in 
overall meat consumption (ratio going from less than zero 
to zero) and not an increase in red meat consumption. 
McCullough and colleagues (19) reported AHEI scores 
for men and women in a 2002 study and reported risk of 
developing major chronic diseases and cardiovascular 
disease in each score quintile. When controlling for smok- 
ing, men in the highest AHEI score quintile (median 
score 52.3) had a relative risk of 0.80 for major chronic 
disease (95% conﬁdence interval 0.71, 0.91; P(cid:2)0.001) and 
a 39% lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease, 
compared with men in the lowest quintile (median score 
31). With women, models that underwent multivariate 
adjustment were nonsigniﬁcant, but unadjusted analyses 
showed that women in the highest AHEI score quintile 
(median score 59.9) had a relative risk of 0.89 for major 
chronic disease (95% conﬁdence interval 0.82, 0.96; 
P(cid:1)0.008) and a 28% lower risk of developing cardiovas- 
cular disease compared with women in the lowest quintile 
(median score 25.4) (19). Even without the addition of 
multivitamin or alcohol AHEI scores (which would add to 
the total AHEI score), the male vegan group’s mean score 
of 52.7(cid:5)16.4 is in the second highest quintiles for men 
and the female vegan group’s mean score of 55.3(cid:5)19.4 is 
in the highest quintile as reported in the study by Mc- 
Cullough and colleagues (19). This score is associated 
with a low risk of developing major chronic disease and 
cardiovascular disease. The American Diabetes Associa- 
tion diet group’s score remained unchanged and, with a 
mean of 29.4(cid:5)18.5 for men and 36.7(cid:5)2.2 for women, 
places them in the lowest quintile for men and the third 
quintile for women (19). 
Although the vegan group signiﬁcantly improved its 
AHEI score in every food category, of particular note is 
the increase in fruit and vegetable intake. Whereas the 
American Diabetes Association diet group did not have a 
signiﬁcant improvement in the number of vegetables or 
fruit consumed, the vegan group had an increase from 
four servings of fruit and vegetables per day to seven and 
one half servings each day. 
In this short-term study, it was not possible to correlate 
the AHEI with the occurrence of chronic diseases such as 
cancer or heart disease. It was possible, however, to cor- 
relate AHEI score with two factors that are associated 
with improvements in diabetes status, ﬁnding that AHEI 
score was correlated with changes in both weight and 
hemoglobin A1c value. This suggests that AHEI score 
may provide a useful tool in assessing dietary quality 
among people with diabetes and assessing future im- 
provement in diabetes disease state. 
The strengths of the study include a prospective de- 
sign and an intention-to-treat analysis. The principal 
weakness is the reliance on self-reported dietary in- 


take, which has been the subject of several critiques 
(33,34). This is an inevitable issue among individuals 
not conﬁned to a metabolic ward. Reductions in clinical 
variables, such as weight, lipid concentrations, and 
hemoglobin A1c value, suggest that both groups made 
diet changes. 
This study examined nutrient changes after 22 weeks 
in persons with type 2 diabetes. Future research should 
examine long-term dietary changes on both vegan and 
American Diabetes Association–recommended diets. This 
research should also examine long-term changes in clin- 
ical measures, such as hemoglobin A1c and lipid values, 
and examine these measures in relation to AHEI score. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Vegan and American Diabetes Association–recommended 
dietary proﬁles are very different in both macro- and 
micronutrient intakes. The vegan group had signiﬁcant 
improvements in energy, total fat, trans fat, cholesterol, 
and ﬁber. The vegan group also saw signiﬁcant improve- 
ments in intakes of several vitamins and minerals, in- 
cluding total vitamin A activity, beta carotene, vitamin K, 
vitamin C, folate, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. 
The American Diabetes Association–recommended diet 
group had signiﬁcant improvements in energy, total fat, 
trans fat, cholesterol, and sodium intakes. Both groups 
had difﬁculty meeting the recommended intakes for vita- 
mins D and E, calcium, and potassium and consumed too 
much sodium, albeit less than at baseline. 
The vegan group improved all food group categories 
and saw a signiﬁcant increase in AHEI score, which was 
associated with improvements in both weight and hemo- 
globin A1c value. The American Diabetes Association diet 
group saw no improvement in AHEI score. Because the 
AHEI is strongly negatively associated with risk of major 
chronic diseases (19), the results of this study suggest 
that, if followed for the long-term, a low-fat vegan diet 
may be associated with a reduced risk of major chronic 
diseases, particularly cardiovascular disease.
