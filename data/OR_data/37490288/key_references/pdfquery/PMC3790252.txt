of a multicomponent worksite intervention 
S Mishra1, ND Barnard1,2, J Gonzales3, J Xu1, U Agarwal1 and S Levin3 
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects on macro- and micronutrient intake of a nutrition intervention program in 
corporate settings across the United States. 
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-two individuals who were overweight or had type 2 diabetes were recruited 
from 10 sites of a US insurance company. Two hundred and seventy-one participants completed baseline diet recalls, and 183 
participants completed dietary recalls at 18 weeks. Sites were randomly assigned to an intervention group (ﬁve sites) or to a control 
group (ﬁve sites) for 18 weeks. At intervention sites, participants were asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet and attend weekly group 
meetings. At control sites, participants continued their usual diets. At baseline and 18 weeks, participants completed 2-day diet 
recalls. Between-group differences in changes in nutrient intake were assessed using an analysis of covariance. 
RESULTS: Compared with those in the control group, intervention-group participants signiﬁcantly reduced the reported intake of 
total fat (P ¼ 0.02), saturated (P ¼ 0.006) and monounsaturated fats (P ¼ 0.01), cholesterol (P ¼ 0.009), protein (P ¼ 0.03) and calcium 
(P ¼ 0.02), and increased the intake of carbohydrate (P ¼ 0.006), ﬁber (P ¼ 0.002), b-carotene (P ¼ 0.01), vitamin C (P ¼ 0.003), 
magnesium (P ¼ 0.04) and potassium (P ¼ 0.002). 
CONCLUSIONS: An 18-week intervention program in a corporate setting reduces intake of total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol 
and increases the intake of protective nutrients, particularly ﬁber, b-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and potassium. The reduction 
in calcium intake indicates the need for planning for this nutrient. 
INTRODUCTION 
Many US Americans consume diets that are overly high in energy 
and in constituents associated with disease risk, particularly 
saturated fat (SFA), cholesterol and sodium and low in protective 
components such as ﬁber or b-carotene.1 Poorly balanced diets 
contribute to overweight, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes 
and other conditions.2–4 
In clinical research studies, individuals who adopt diets emphasiz- 
ing vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes report signiﬁcant 
reductions in the intake of fat and cholesterol and increases in ﬁber, 
b-carotene, magnesium, potassium and vitamin K intake.5,6 Plant- 
based diets are associated with improvements in body weight, 
plasma lipid concentrations,7 glycemic control8 and blood pressure9 
and may assist in the management of prostate cancer.10–12 
We tested a program designed to translate a plant-based 
dietary intervention from the research environment 
to the 
workplace. An initial controlled study at two corporate sites of 
the Government Employees Insurance Company, a large US 
insurer, showed that providing instruction in the use of plant- 
based diets tended to cause weight loss, improvements in plasma 
lipid concentrations and, for those with diabetes, improved blood 
glucose control.13 A subsequent trial at 10 corporate Government 
Employees Insurance Company sites in diverse regions of the 
United States showed similar results.14 
As plant-based diets may alter a wide range of macronutrient 
and micronutrient intakes affecting health in many ways, we 
sought 
to assess the nutrient changes associated with the 
intervention diet in the latter study. Those nutrient changes are 
the focus of the current report. We hypothesized that a plant- 
based dietary intervention would reduce the intake of energy, SFA 
and cholesterol and increase the intake of ﬁber, b-carotene, 
vitamin C and potassium. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
The study design and major physiological results have been described 
elsewhere.14 Brieﬂy, the overall study tested the hypothesis that a program 
including a low-fat vegan diet taught through group sessions at worksites 
in widely divergent areas of the United States would elicit improvements 
in body weight and other health indicators. The study was intended 
to translate the ﬁndings of intervention trials into a simple program

that could be implemented for large groups of individuals at work. It was 
designed not to test individual program components (for example, a diet 
or a group of classes) but rather to assess the effect of the intervention 
program as a whole, similar to the design of the Diabetes Prevention 
Program, which tested the combined effects of diet and exercise 
interventions in individuals at risk for diabetes.15 
Individuals aged 18 years or above with a body mass index of 
X25 kg/m2 or a previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were recruited 
through employee notices at 10 Government Employees Insurance 
Company corporate ofﬁces in the United States: Tucson, Arizona; 
San Diego, California; Lakeland, Florida; Macon, Georgia; Chevy Chase, 
Maryland; Buffalo, New York; Woodbury, New York; Dallas, Texas; 
Fredericksburg, Virginia; and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Exclusion criteria 
were current alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy, history of severe mental 
illness, unstable medical status, current adherence to a low-fat vegetarian 
diet, participation in the previous Government Employees Insurance 
Company study and inability to attend weekly meetings. 
Interested individuals attended a group meeting with the research staff. 
Those who appeared to satisfy the participation criteria were scheduled for 
interviews to review the study procedures and conﬁrm 
individual 
eligibility. These interested individuals were then asked to complete a 
practice 2-day online diet recall. 

institutional review board 
(Independent Review Consulting, whose name was 
later changed 
to Ethical and Independent Review Services, Corte Madera, CA, USA.). 
All participants provided written informed consent. 
Worksites were then pair-matched based on the number of volunteers 
per site. Each pair of sites represented a cluster, and, using a random- 
number table, the sites within each pair were randomly assigned to the 
intervention (ﬁves sites) or control (ﬁve sites) groups. As the assignment 
was done by site rather than by individual, all participants at a given site 
were in the same assigned group. This method was used because of the 
likelihood that the intervention, which would be strongly apparent in the 
work environment, would tend to inﬂuence the behavior of individuals 
throughout the worksite, including those not assigned to the intervention 
group. 
At intervention sites, participants were asked to follow a low-fat vegan 
diet and attend weekly group meetings. They received no monetary 
compensation. Individuals at control sites were given no dietary guidance 
and were not asked to make any dietary changes. They were given 
monetary compensation in the form of gift certiﬁcates to retail stores 
(Whole Foods Market or Target), totaling $50 for completion of all baseline 
and week-18 assessments. The rationale for compensation of control- 
group participants was that, unlike the intervention group, they received 
no other beneﬁt from the study and had no contact with the investigators, 
aside from the assessments. All participants in both groups were asked to 
avoid changing exercise patterns during the study period. 
Intervention diet 
Participants at intervention sites were asked to avoid animal products 
(that is, meat, poultry, ﬁsh, dairy products and eggs) and to base their diets 
legumes and fruits. They were also 
on whole grains, vegetables, 
encouraged to minimize added oils and to favor foods with a low 
glycemic index, such as beans, fruit, pasta, rye and pumpernickel bread 
(rather than typical wheat breads), and oatmeal or bran cereal (rather than 
typical cold cereals). No restrictions were placed on portion sizes or on 
energy or carbohydrate intakes. Intervention-group participants were also 
asked to take a daily supplement of vitamin B12, such as a multiple vitamin. 
At intervention sites with cafeterias, food service managers were asked to 
include low-fat plant-based menu options, such as oatmeal, minestrone or 
lentil soup, veggie burgers and portobello sandwiches, among the daily 
offerings. Whether and how to implement such menu additions were 
left to their discretion, and their progress in doing so was not formally 
assessed. 
Participants at intervention sites were asked to follow the prescribed 
diet for 18 weeks. They were provided group support in the form of weekly 
lunch-hour classes at the worksite led by a registered dietitian, physician 
and/or a cooking instructor, following an established curriculum for the 
the study. Classes included sessions on replacements 
duration of 
for animal products, healthful snacking, dining out, travel, shopping and 
cooking, as well as nutrition-related health topics such as weight loss, 
diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Group discussions during each session 
focused on common diet challenges and successes. Participants were 
offered additional support through an interactive online message board on 
which they could ask or respond to questions. All 
instructors received 
training in study procedures and best practices for facilitating group 
instruction materials (a standardized 
discussion and used identical 
curriculum, handouts, videos, instructions for cooking, and so on). 
Assessment of dietary intake and adherence to dietary 
intervention 
The following measures were assessed at baseline and week 18: 
A diet recall was used to assess nutrient intake over two 24-h periods at 
baseline and two 24-h periods at 18 weeks, using an online (Automated 
Self-administered 24-h Recall, ASA-24) program developed by the National 
Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA).16 
The format and design of the ASA-24 are based on the interviewer- 
administered Automated Multiple Pass Method 24-h recall developed by 
the US Department of Agriculture. The online program has the advantages 
of ease of use and scoring and face validity; however, although the 
Automated Multiple Pass Method is a validated instrument, validation trials 
of ASA-24 remained in progress at the time of this study.17 Subjects were 
asked to complete their diet records online as best they could. Subjects 
were advised of vegan items that ASA-24 does include, such as vegan 
burger, seitan and tofu, and of common vegan items that are not on 
ASA-24, such as quinoa and tempeh. Subjects were instructed not to skip 
any entries even if exact matches were not found in ASA-24. Instead, they 
were coached on how to ﬁnd a suitable alterative, such as substituting 
brown rice for quinoa or vegetarian sub for vegan sandwich. Registered 
dietitians cross-checked data on ASA-24 by taking participant nutrient data 
and entering them into the USDA nutrient database to make sure nutrient 
intake numbers were relevant to ASA-24. Numbers that appeared erroneous 
were excluded, such as an intake of 500 calories reported for an entire day. 
Macronutrient intakes were reported as percentages of total energy intake, 
and ﬁber and micronutrients were reported as quantities per 1000 kcal. 
As animal products are the only signiﬁcant source of dietary cholesterol, 
cholesterol 
intake reported at 18 weeks served as a rough gauge of 
adherence to the intervention diet. The numbers of group participants 
whose cholesterol 
intake was p50 mg/day (the amount of cholesterol 
in B2 ounces of typical meats or cheeses) and p75 mg/day (the amount 
of cholesterol found in B3 ounces of typical meats or cheeses) were 
calculated from 18-week diet recalls. The number of group participants 
whose fat intake was below 25 and 35% of the total calorie intake was also 
calculated. Use of low-glycemic-index foods was not tracked. 
All participants were asked to continue their pre-existing medication 
regimens unless otherwise instructed by their personal physicians. No 
other restrictions were placed on medication use. 
Statistical analysis 
t-tests and w2-tests were used to assess whether any 
Student’s 
demographic or clinical measures between groups at baseline were 
unbalanced. Nutrient data were examined for extreme values, and 
distributions of variables were examined for skewness using a normality 
plot and the Shapiro–Wilk test. 
Statistical analyses of nutrient intake were performed on an intention-to- 
treat basis, including all participants who completed an initial diet recall, 
with the post-intervention values for dropouts set to the pre-intervention 
values. A second analysis was limited to participants who completed diet 
recalls at baseline and 18 weeks. The signiﬁcance of within-group changes 
in dietary variables was determined using paired t-tests. A general linear 
model univariate analysis (analysis of covariance) was used to estimate the 
treatment effect and determine whether the changes in nutrient intake of 
the intervention and control groups during the 18-week trial were 
signiﬁcantly different from each other. Diet group was included as a ﬁxed 
factor in these models, with the baseline value of each nutrient as a 
covariate. In addition, the geographic site was added to the model as a 
random effect to account for within-site correlation in outcomes. As the 
number of sites was small, the signiﬁcance of and conﬁdence intervals for 
treatment effect were computed using the Kenward–Roger correction. 
All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis Software, SAS

Fredericksburg, Woodbury, Dallas and Virginia Beach. Of 319 
volunteers screened for eligibility, 292 (142 at intervention sites 
and 150 at control sites) met the participation criteria and were 
enrolled in the overall clinical trial. Of this group, 271 (130 at 
intervention sites and 141 at control sites) completed usable 
baseline diet recalls and constituted the baseline sample for the 
current inquiry. At 18 weeks, 183 (78 in the intervention group and 
recalls and were 
105 in the control group) completed diet 
considered study completers for purposes of the nutrient analysis. 
There were no signiﬁcant demographic differences between the 
intervention and control groups at baseline, except for a some- 
what greater percentage of women at control sites (Table 1). 
Among completers, the intervention-group and control-group 
completers differed only with regard to gender (76% women in 
the intervention group, 88% women in the control group, 
P ¼ 0.04). Compared with noncompleters, study completers were 
older (45.5 versus 41.6 years, P ¼ 0.008) and had a lower mean 
baseline body mass index (34.3 versus 37.3 kg/m2, P ¼ 0.006). 
The median percentage of group sessions attended per 
participant (among the completers at intervention sites) ranged 
from 33% in Macon to 75% in Chevy Chase, with an overall 
median of 50%. 
Adherence to the intervention 
Among study completers, cholesterol 
intake at 18 weeks was 
p75 mg/day for 85% (66/78) of intervention-group participants 
and 21% (22/105) of control-group participants 
(Po0.001). 
Cholesterol intake was p50 mg/day for 74% (58/78) of interven- 
tion-group participants but only 13% (14/105) of control-group 
participants (Po0.001). 
Total fat intake was p35% of the total calorie intake for 86% 
(67/78) of intervention-group participants compared with 40% 
(42/105) of the control-group participants (Po0.001). Fat intake 
was p25% for 49% (38/78) of intervention-group participants and 
for 8% (8/105) of control-group participants (Po0.001). 
SFA intake was p10% of total calorie intake for 88% (69/78) of 
intervention-group participants and 38% (40/105) of control- 
group participants (Po0.001). SFA intake was p5% of total calorie 
intake for 51% (40/78) of intervention-group participants but only 
for 5% (5/105) of control-group participants (Po0.001). 
Nutrient intake at baseline and 18 weeks 
At baseline, there were signiﬁcant differences between partici- 
pants in the two study arms with respect to the percentage of 
energy from fat (P ¼ 0.04) and vitamin B12 per 1000 kcal (P ¼ 0.05). 
During the 18-week intervention, both groups reduced the 
reported energy intake but the between-group difference was 
not signiﬁcant (Table 2). Comparing nutrient intake changes over 
time between the two groups in the intention-to-treat analysis, 
adjusting for baseline values and accounting for within-site 
the intervention group signiﬁcantly 
correlations in outcome, 
reduced the mean reported intake of fat, particularly of SFA but 
also of monounsaturated fat (Table 2). It increased carbohydrate 
and ﬁber intake and reduced protein and cholesterol 
intake. 
The intervention group also increased the reported intake of 
b-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and potassium. The calcium 
intakes of both groups were below the recommended levels at 
baseline, and calcium intake fell further in the intervention group. 
Limiting the analysis to study completers, results were similar to 
those in the intention-to-treat analysis (Table 3). Overall reported 
in both groups. Compared with changes in 
energy intake fell 
the control group, the intervention group reduced the reported 
intake of fat (total, monounsaturated fat and SFA), protein and 
cholesterol and increased carbohydrate and ﬁber 
In 
addition, retinol 
intake fell, which was compensated for by an 
increase in b-carotene. Reported intakes of vitamin K, vitamin B6,

DISCUSSION 
A nutrition intervention program at 
the workplace yielded 
clinically important changes in nutrient intake. These changes 
were similar to those previously reported in clinical research 
settings, suggesting that 
these research ﬁndings effectively 
translated into an intervention implemented at worksites in 
widely divergent areas of the United States. 
The overall reported energy intake fell in both groups. Part of 
this reduction may be because of underreporting, which is 
common in clinical trials of non-institutionalized participants.18,19 
Another possible explanation is that because ASA-24 does not 
contain common vegan food items, subjects may have omitted 
these foods, resulting in lower energy intake reports. However, it is 
likely that the reduced energy intake of the intervention group is, 
at least in part, on account of increased ﬁber intake and reduced 
fat intake, both of which would tend to reduce the energy density 
of the diet. In turn, a reduction in energy intake favors weight loss, 
which has been observed in prior studies using low-fat, plant- 
based diets20 and was observed in the current study.14 Reductions 
in reported energy intake and weight loss commonly occur with 
plant-based diets, even in the absence of speciﬁc limitations on 
energy intake or speciﬁc guidance regarding portion control.20 
Diets high in ﬁber may also facilitate removal of cholesterol,21,22 
with favorable effects for individuals at risk of cardiovascular 
disease. In a 5-year study of patients with heart disease, a low-fat 
vegetarian diet as a part of a program of lifestyle changes has 
been shown to reverse atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of 
cardiac events.23 
Reported protein intake decreased in the intervention group, 
but the percentage of energy from protein remained within the 
range recommended by the Institute of Medicine.24 
Among micronutrients, the intervention group increased the 
reported intake of b-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and 
potassium. As expected, vitamin B12 from food sources fell 
in 
the intervention group. However, participants were asked to take 
supplemental B12. For both groups, calcium intake was below the 
levels recommended by the Institute of Medicine at baseline and 
again at 18 weeks, and was dropped in the intervention group. 
In estimating calcium requirements, committees have used 
varying methods to calculate skeletal accretion and turnover 
rates, resulting in a considerable worldwide debate about whether 
currently recommended intakes of calcium are adequate to 
maximize peak bone mass and to minimize bone loss and fracture 
risk in later life.25 However, this may indicate the need for further 
instruction on plant-based sources of calcium, such as green leafy 
vegetables and legumes. Reported iron intake increased in the 
intervention group, reﬂecting the increased intake of plant-based 
sources of iron. 
The 18-week nutrient intake data indicate that some interven- 
tion group participants continued to include some animal 
products in their diets and consumed more fat than had been 
recommended. Nonetheless, the two groups diverged markedly in 
their reported dietary behavior, suggesting that the intervention 
elicits signiﬁcant changes even for those participants who do not 
fully adhere to the prescribed guidelines. As previously reported, 
these nutrient changes are reﬂected in improvements in body 
weight, plasma lipid concentrations, and, for those with diabetes, 
improvements in glycemic control.14 
The tendency of plant-based diets to favorably inﬂuence 
nutrient intake and clinical measures related to disease risk raises 
the question of their sustainability over the long term. A University 
of Pittsburgh survey of young women who had tried both 
vegetarian and various calorie-restricted diets26 found that the 
mean duration of adherence to vegetarian diets was at least 
2 years, compared with only 4 months for calorie-restricted diets.

eating behavior have been studied, and vegetarian and vegan 
regimens appear to be generally similar to other therapeutic diets 
within these parameters.27 
Strengths of the study include participation by individuals from 
divergent geographical areas, whose tastes and dietary habits and 
whose access to healthful foods likely varied as well; the use of a 
dietary intervention that can be reproduced in other corporate 
locations; and sufﬁcient statistical power to demonstrate sig- 
niﬁcant changes. 
The study also has several limitations. Its duration was limited to 
18 weeks, primarily on account of the challenges of retaining 
untreated control-group participants over a longer period of time. 
Had the study design included an active comparison program 
within the control group, 
it may have permitted sufﬁcient 
engagement for a longer study, although such a design would 
have eliminated the possibility of comparisons with an untreated 
control. Nutrient intakes were self-reported. Men were under- 
represented in the participant sample for reasons that are unclear. 
Randomization was based on geographical site rather than on the 
individual participant. Although there appeared to be a reason- 
able balance among those variables that were reported, we 
cannot assume balance on other unreported or unmeasured 
variables. A number of participants failed to complete 18-week 
diet recalls. Possible reasons for a failure to complete nutrient 
records include limited access to the internet and difﬁculties in 
navigating through the ASA-24 online diet recall program. 
CONCLUSION 
In summary, 
the present study demonstrated that a simple 
nutrition education program using modest group support at the 
place of employment yields signiﬁcant improvements in nutrient 
intakes. The worksite is a potentially important venue for nutrition 
teaching and lifestyle modiﬁcation and merits increased attention. 
In interventions using plant-based diets, planning for adequate 
intake of vitamin B12 and calcium is important. Future studies 
should focus on the longer-term nutrient changes associated 
with worksite dietary intervention programs.
