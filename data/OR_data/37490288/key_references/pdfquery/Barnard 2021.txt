Excess body weight and cardiovascular disease are major 
worldwide health problems. Approximately 70% of US 
adults are overweight (1), and nearly half have cardiovascu- 
lar disease (including coronary heart disease, heart failure, 
stroke or hypertension) (2). 
Mediterranean and vegan diets have long been studied 
for their effects on body weight and cardiometabolic risk. 
While a “Mediterranean diet” can refer to a variety of culin- 
ary traditions, the term has been codified for research pur- 
poses to refer to a diet that includes abundant plant-based 
foods, favors olive oil as the primary source of fat, and 
includes low to moderate amounts of meat, dairy products,

ABSTRACT 
Objective: Evidence suggests that both Mediterranean and vegan diets improve body weight and 
cardiometabolic risk factors, but their relative efficacy has not been compared in a random- 
ized trial. 
Methods: In a randomized crossover trial, 62 overweight adults were randomly assigned to a 
Mediterranean or vegan diet for a 16-week period. Body weight, plasma lipids, blood pressure, 
and body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. Secondary measures included 
insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment, HOMA-IR), oral glucose insulin sensitivity 
(OGIS), and predicted insulin sensitivity (PREDIM) indices. Thereafter, participants were asked to 
return to their baseline diets for 4 weeks, after which they began the opposite diet for 16 weeks. 
The same parameters were measured before and after this 2nd 16-week period. 
Results: Overall net weight changes were 0.0 (Mediterranean) and (cid:1)6.0 kg (vegan), (treatment 
effect (cid:1)6.0 kg [95% CI (cid:1)7.5 to (cid:1)4.5]; p < 0.001). HOMA-IR decreased and OGIS increased on the 
vegan diet with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect (cid:1)0.7 [95% CI, 
(cid:1)1.8 to þ0.4]; p ¼ 0.21; and þ35.8 mL/min/m2 [95% CI, þ13.2 to þ58.3]; p ¼ 0.003, respectively). 
PREDIM did not change significantly in either group. Among participants with no medication 
changes, total and LDL-cholesterol decreased 18.7 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L) and 15.3 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/ 
L), respectively, on the vegan diet, compared with no significant change on the Mediterranean 
diet (treatment effect (cid:1)15.6 [-24.6 to (cid:1)6.6]; p ¼ 0.001 and (cid:1)14.8 [-23.5 to (cid:1)6.2]; p ¼ 0.001, 
respectively); 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 9.3 and 7.3 mmHg on the 
Mediterranean diet, compared with 3.4 and 4.1 mmHg on the vegan diet (treatment effect þ5.9 
[95% CI þ1.0 to þ10.9]; p ¼ 0.02; and þ1.8 [95% CI (cid:1)4.6 to þ8.1]; p ¼ 0.58, respectively). 
Conclusions: A low-fat vegan diet improved body weight, lipid concentrations, and insulin sensi- 
tivity, both from baseline and compared with a Mediterranean diet. Blood pressure decreased on 
both diets, more on the Mediterranean diet.

cardiovascular event was reduced by approximately 30% in 
the groups following a Mediterranean diet supplemented 
with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, compared with an 
untreated control group (4). 



The effect of such a diet on body weight is less clear. A 
2016 systematic review (5) reported that clinical trials using 
loss. 
Mediterranean 
However, all 5 reviewed studies included either added exer- 
cise or calorie restriction, confounding the effects of the 
dietary change. A later randomized trial reported significant 
weight loss with a Mediterranean diet, but the study also 
included a substantial energy restriction and physical exer- 
cise (6). In the Lyon Diet Heart Study (7), a Mediterranean 
diet supplemented with an alpha-linolenic-acid-rich margar- 
ine reduced cardiac deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarc- 
tions 
in individuals who had survived a myocardial 
infarction but led to a small weight gain (1.4 kg) during the 
2-year study, rather than weight loss (8). In the PREDIMED 
study, although 90% of participants had excess body weight 
at baseline (9), weight loss over the first 3 study months was 
only 0.19 kg in the olive oil-supplemented group and 0.26 kg 
in the nut-supplemented group (4). 


following vegan 
diets tend to have lower body weights (10) and fewer cardio- 
vascular disease risk factors (11), compared with individuals 
following other dietary patterns. In a meta-analysis of 15 
clinical trials, prescription of vegetarian diets was associated 
with a mean weight loss among study completers of 4.6 kg 
(12). In a separate meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials includ- 
ing 1151 participants, weight change among participants fol- 
lowing a vegan diet was (cid:1)2.52 kg (95% CI (cid:1)3.02 to (cid:1)1.98)

improves body weight (12), plasma lipids (14), blood pres- 
sure (15), and glycemic control (16). 


Mediterranean and vegan diets are variations on a theme: 
one favors plant-based foods; the other consists of plant 
products 
Prospective

and Obesity (EPIC-PANACEA) 
Eating out of Home, 
reported that the only aspect of a Mediterranean diet that 
was associated with protection from weight gain was the 
avoidance of meat products (17). In the PREDIMED study, 
a sub-analysis revealed that, the more participants followed 
a plant-based dietary pattern, the lower their risk of cardio- 
vascular events (18). 
None of these studies has examined the relative effects of 
a Mediterranean and low-fat vegan diet for improving body 
weight or altering cardiovascular risk factors. Such a study 
would require random assignment of individuals to these 
diets followed by a detailed examination of their effects, but 
no such study has been done. There is particular value to a 
cross-over study design in which two diets are tested, not in 
similar individuals, but in precisely the same individuals. 
Such studies require careful analysis, however, because the 
physical effects of the diet presented first will necessarily 
influence the experience of the second diet in such a way 
that even an extended wash-out period cannot overcome. 
To take advantage of the statistical power of a crossover 
design, it is therefore essential to adjust for differences in 
body weight and other parameters that have occurred over 
the course of the study. 
The present study directly compared a Mediterranean 
and a vegan diet for their effects on weight and cardiometa- 
bolic parameters, using a cross-over design. Based on the 
findings of prior studies, it tested the hypothesis that, com- 
pared with a Mediterranean diet, a low-fat vegan diet results 
in greater changes in body weight, total and LDL-cholesterol 
concentrations, and insulin sensitivity. 


The intervention was conducted between February and 
October 2019 in Washington, DC. Adults with a body mass 
index between 28 and 40 kg/m2, were enrolled. Exclusion 
criteria were type 1 diabetes, smoking, alcohol or drug 
abuse, pregnancy or lactation, and current use of a vegan or 
Mediterranean diet. 

Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two 
groups. Group 1 was to begin a Mediterranean diet, and 
low-fat vegan diet, both 
Group 2 was 
for 16 weeks. 

The Mediterranean diet followed the PREDIMED proto- 
col (4). Participants were asked to consume (cid:3)2 daily serv- 
ings of vegetables, (cid:3)2-3 daily servings of fresh fruits, (cid:3)3 
weekly servings of legumes, (cid:3)3 weekly servings of fish or 
shellfish, and (cid:3)3 weekly servings of nuts or seeds, and to 
select white meats (with visible fat removed) instead of red 
meats. Participants were asked to limit or eliminate cream, 
butter, margarine, processed meats, sweetened beverages, 
pastries, and processed snacks. Nuts, eggs, fish and shellfish, 
low-fat cheese, chocolate ((cid:3)50% cocoa) and whole-grain 
cereals could be consumed ad libitum. Cured ham, red 
meat, and fatty cheeses were limited to (cid:4)1 serving per week. 
Participants were asked to use extra virgin olive oil instead 
of other fats or oils in food preparation, using 50 g per day 
as part of (not in addition to) their regular food intake. 
The low-fat vegan diet ((cid:5)75% of energy from carbohy- 
drates, 15% protein, and 10% fat) consisted of vegetables, 
grains, legumes, and fruits. Participants were instructed to 
avoid animal products and added fats. No meals were pro- 
vided. Vitamin B12 was supplemented (500 mg/day) during 
the vegan phase of the study. 
For both diets, no limitations were placed on energy 
intake. Alcoholic beverages were limited to one per day for 
women and two per day for men. All study participants 
were asked not to alter their exercise habits and to continue 
their preexisting medication regimens for the study dur- 
ation, except as modified by their personal physicians. 
Participants were asked to attend weekly classes of identi- 
cal intensity but with content appropriate for their respective 
diets. Classes covered food preparation, maintaining the 
assigned diet while traveling or dining at restaurants, and 
various health topics, were led by registered dietitians, physi- 
cians, or other study personnel with particular expertise in 
the respective diets. 
A 3-day dietary record was completed by each participant 
at baseline and week 16. Dietary intake data were collected 
and analyzed by a Registered Dietitian or a staff member 
certified in Nutrition Data System for Research version 2018 
(Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, 
Minneapolis, MN) (19). Physical activity was assessed by the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (20).

ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03698955). All participants gave 
written informed consent. 




All measurements were performed at baseline and week 16 
after a 10 h overnight fast. 
Body weight and composition 
Height (baseline only) and weight were measured using a 
stadiometer and a calibrated scale accurate to 0.1 kg, respect- 
ively. Body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray 
absorptiometry (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare; Madison, WI) 
with EncoreVR 2005 v.9.15.010 software, equipped with the 
CoreScan module (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) to measure 
visceral adipose tissue volume. 
Blood lipids 
Plasma lipid concentrations were measured by enzymatic 
colorimetric methods (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). 
Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance 
Insulin secretion and glucose tolerance were assessed after 
stimulation with a liquid breakfast 
(Boost Plus, Nestle, 
Vevey, Switzerland; 720 kcal, 34% of energy from fat, 16% 
protein, 50% carbohydrate). Plasma concentrations of glu- 
cose, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide were measured 
at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. Serum glucose was analyzed 
using the Hexokinase UV endpoint method (Roche, Basel, 
Switzerland). Plasma immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide 
concentrations were determined using insulin and C-peptide 
electro-chemiluminescence 
kits 
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). HbA1c was measured by tur-

After the 16-week point, participants were asked to 
return to their customary eating habits for four weeks, then 
to begin the opposite diet (those initially randomized to the

Based on previous studies and with an alpha-level 0.05, the 
expected changes in body weight were (cid:1)0.3 (95% CI (cid:1)0.61 
to 0.09) kg on the Mediterranean diet and (cid:1)6.5 (95% CI 
(cid:1)8.9 to (cid:1)4.1) kg on the low-fat vegan diet in 16 weeks. For 
90% power to detect a significant 
treatment effect, we 
needed 24 participants to complete both interventions in a 
cross-over 
the 
required sample size was 30 total for 90% power. 


While a cross-over design provides technical advantages, it 
requires specific statistical operations. The primary analysis 
included all participants with available data for the four 
evaluation timepoints for each outcome analyzed. A cross- 
over ANOVA model was used with between-subject and 
within-subject 
diet 
(Mediterranean and vegan), subject, time (week), period (1 
and 2) were included in the model for participants with 
complete data. 




Evidence of a carryover effect between the two treatment 
periods was evaluated for each outcome by assessing the sig- 
nificance of an interaction between period and initial treat- 
ment assignment in a linear mixed model of the outcome 
with treatment and period as fixed effects and participant as 
a random effect, fit for participants with complete data. For 
all variables for which this interaction was not statistically 
significant, 
treatment 
the magnitude and significance of 
effect were then evaluated using a one-sample t-test (two- 
sided with alpha level of 0.05) evaluating differences between 
change in outcome when on the vegan diet versus change in 
outcome when on the Mediterranean diet for all participants 
with complete data. For any outcomes with evidence of a 
carryover effect, estimated treatment effect 
for the first 
period of the trial alone was deemed the more appropriate. 
Within each group, paired comparison t-tests were calcu- 
lated to test whether the changes from baseline to 16 weeks 
in each treatment period were statistically significant. The 
statistician was blinded to the hypothesized effects of inter- 
ventions and group assignment. Results are presented as 
means with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1. There 
were no significant differences between the groups. 
Four participants dropped out during a vegan phase and six 
dropped out during a Mediterranean phase, mostly for reasons 
unrelated to the study, leaving 52 (84%) study completers. 

Dietary intake, physical activity, and cardiometabolic out- 
comes are presented in Table 2. Changes in the first and 
second study periods separately, as well as tests for a carry- 
over 
effects 
(indicating non-consistent 
observed in the two periods) are presented in Table 3. 


From the analysis of the full crossover study shown in 
Table 2, self-reported energy intake decreased on the vegan 
diet by 500 kcal/day (p < 0.001) but did not change signifi- 
cantly on the Mediterranean diet. The percentage of energy 
consumed from fat decreased on the vegan diet (p < 0.001) 
but increased on the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.001), mainly 
due to increased monounsaturated fat intake (p < 0.001). 
Energy from carbohydrates increased on the vegan diet (p 
(p 
< 0.001) and decreased on the Mediterranean diet 
















































< 0.001). Fiber intake increased on both diets, but more so 
on the vegan diet (p < 0.001). The treatment effect was 
highly statistically significant for all dietary intake factors 
examined, except alcohol intake. 
On the vegan diet, final 3-day dietary records showed 
that 42/52 participants (81%) reported avoiding all animal 
products, 49/52 participants (94%) consistently consumed 
less than 50 mg cholesterol a day, and 46/52 (86%) con- 
sumed less than 25% energy from fat and less than 5% 
energy from saturated fat. On the Mediterranean diet, 38/52 
(73%) consumed 2 or more servings of vegetables per day 
and 49/52 participants (94%) consumed olive oil as the 
main culinary fat. 

Despite the request that medications remain constant, 7 par- 
ticipants reduced or discontinued lipid-lowering medications 
during vegan diet phases, 2 did so during Mediterranean 
diet phases, and 1 increased them in a Mediterranean diet 
phase. Similarly, 7 participants reduced or discontinued 
anti-hypertensive medications during vegan phases; 6 did so 
during Mediterranean phases. One participant 
increased 
these medications during a vegan phase; 1 did so during a 
Mediterranean phase. 

During the initial 16-week period, mean weight change was 
(cid:1)1.5 (-2.9 to þ0.02) kg on the Mediterranean diet and (cid:1)7.9 
(-9.3 to (cid:1)6.5) kg on the vegan diet. In the second study 
period, mean weight change was þ1.4 (þ0.4 to þ2.3) kg on 
the Mediterranean diet and (cid:1)4.0 (-5.6 to (cid:1)2.4) kg on the 
vegan diet (see Figure 1 and Table 3). There was no evi- 
dence of a difference in treatment effect for weight change 
between the two periods (p ¼ 0.45 for carryover effect). 
Overall, mean body weight decreased 6.0 kg on the vegan 
diet, compared with no mean change on the Mediterranean 
diet (treatment effect (cid:1)6.0 kg [95% CI (cid:1)7.5 to (cid:1)4.5]; p 
< 0.001). Most of the vegan-phase weight change was attrib- 
utable to a reduction in fat mass and visceral fat volume 
(treatment effect (cid:1)3.4 kg [95% CI (cid:1)4.7 to (cid:1)2.2]; p < 0.001; 
and (cid:1)314.5 cm3 [95% CI (cid:1)446.7 to (cid:1)182.4]; p < 0.001, 
respectively). Of the 52 study completers, 26 lost weight dur- 
ing the Mediterranean phase, compared with 48 participants 
during the vegan phase (see Supplemental Figure 2). 
On the Mediterranean diet, weight changes were associ- 
ated with changes in fiber intake (r¼(cid:1)0.30; p ¼ 0.02), par- 
ticularly insoluble fiber (r¼(cid:1)0.31; p ¼ 0.02). On the vegan 
diet, weight loss was associated with reduction in energy 
intake (r¼ þ0.37; p ¼ 0.007) and decrease in total fat con- 
sumption (r¼ þ0.47; p < 0.001), particularly saturated fat 
(r¼ þ0.40; p ¼ 0.003).

the vegan diet (treatment effect, systolic, þ6.0 [95% CI þ1.0 
to þ10.9]; p ¼ 0.02; diastolic, þ3.2 [95% CI 0.0 to þ6.4];

Improvements in most cardiometabolic outcomes were more 
pronounced on both diets during the first study period (rep- 
resenting the change from baseline) than the second study 
period (reflecting the change from the previous diet and 
washout period) (Table 3). The interaction test for a carry- 
over effect, which would reflect inconsistency of estimated 
treatment effects between the first and second study period, 
was not statistically significant for most outcomes, indicating 





In the first 16 weeks of the study, a low-fat vegan diet led to 
greater reductions in body weight (by 6.4 kg), fat mass (by 
compared with a 
3.8 kg), 
Mediterranean diet, with no difference in blood lipids and 
blood pressure between the treatments. Evaluating the data 
from the whole 36-week cross-over trial, a low-fat vegan 
diet led to greater reductions in body weight (by 6.0 kg), fat 
mass (by 3.4 kg), visceral fat (by 315 cm3) and plasma lipid 
concentrations compared with a Mediterranean diet, while 
both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased more on 
the Mediterranean diet (by 6.0 and 3.2 mmHg, respectively). 
We observed no carryover effect for most variables, except 
for physical activity and systolic blood pressure (when eval- 
uated among all participants including those with antihyper- 
tensive medication changes). For these two outcomes, the 
estimated first-period-only treatment effects in Table 3 may 
be viewed as potentially more valid. 
With regard to body weight, it is important to note that 
despite the fact that neither diet was energy-restricted, par- 
ticipants reduced energy intake on the low-fat vegan diet 
compared with the Mediterranean diet. The present study 
confirms the findings of the Lyon and PREDIMED studies, 
suggesting that a Mediterranean diet, as delivered in these 
trials, is not effective for weight loss. This may have been 
attributable, in part, to the fact that these trials did not actu- 
ally mirror a traditional Mediterranean diet. Keys’ studies of 
Mediterranean diets used as a point of reference the south- 
ern Italian village of Nicotera, where only 23% of typical 
energy consumption was derived from fat (5, 24). The Lyon 
and PREDIMED studies used artificial diets, emphasizing 
margarine and fish (Lyon Study, with a reported fat intake 
of 30.4% of energy in the experimental group) (8) or fish, 
oil, and/or nuts (PREDIMED, with a reported fat intake of 
41% and 42% of energy in the olive oil and nut groups, 
respectively); it may be that the presence of energy-dense 
fish and other animal products, along with oil or nuts, 
study’s 
counteracted weight-loss 
Mediterranean intervention followed the PREDIMED guide- 
lines, with similar results for body weight. 


The low-fat vegan diet led to significant weight loss, con- 
firming the findings of prior studies (12). Clinical trials sug- 
that plant-based diets reduce body weight by two 
gest 
concurrent mechanisms. First, a reduction in dietary fat and 
increase in fiber lead to a reduction in dietary energy dens- 
ity, which reduces energy intake (25). This reduction in 
energy intake occurs despite the fact that the diet was ad 
libitum, as was the Mediterranean diet. Second, a low-fat 
vegan diet increases postprandial energy expenditure. The 
thermic effect of food—i.e., the increased energy expenditure 
that comes from processing and storing food—accounts for 
approximately 10% of total energy expenditure. In a study 
of postmenopausal women, the thermic effect of food, as 
measured by indirect calorimetry using a standard test meal, 
was 16% higher after 14 weeks on a low-fat, vegan diet (26). 
Similar results were achieved in overweight men and women 
after 16 weeks of a low-fat, vegan diet, where the thermic 
effect of food increased by 14% compared with the control 
group (27). In turn, this increased energy expenditure may 
reflect changes in mitochondrial action. In a 2005 study, a 
high-fat (50% of energy) diet, followed for 3 days, led to a 
downregulation of the genes required for mitochondrial oxi- 
dative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle (28). Similarly, a 
2015 study showed that a high-fat diet may facilitate the 
passage of bacterial endotoxins through the gut wall (29). In 
turn, endotoxins appeared to impair postprandial cellular 
glucose oxidation. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies 
show that a low-fat vegan diet reduces hepatocellular and 
intramyocellular lipid concentrations and increases insulin 
sensitivity, 
thereby increasing energy expenditure in the 
postprandial period (27). Together, these findings suggest 
high-fat diets may disrupt postprandial energy expenditure, 
while low-fat, plant-based diets may have the opposite effect. 
to a 
Mediterranean-style diet 
typically improves plasma lipid 
concentrations by virtue of reduced intake of saturated fat 
and 
a 
Mediterranean-style diet led to a greater reduction in LDL- 
cholesterol concentrations, compared with a control group 
following a diet intended to limit fat to 30% of energy (in 
practice, fat intake was 34% of energy) (30). Likewise, partic- 
ipants in the PREDIMED study following Mediterranean 








diets also improved their LDL-cholesterol more than the 
control group (4). Small reductions in total cholesterol 
in 
(-0.16 mmol/L) 
response to a Mediterranean diet were demonstrated in a 
meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (31). 


In the present study, the LDL-cholesterol reduction in 
response to the low-fat vegan diet was significantly greater 
than that observed with the Mediterranean diet, reflecting 
the fact that, while the Mediterranean diet reduced the per- 
centage of energy from saturated fat, the vegan diet reduced 
it significantly more, along with an effective elimination of 
cholesterol intake. In a 2015 meta-analysis of 11 clinical tri- 
als, vegetarian diets reduced total and LDL-cholesterol by 
and 13 mg/dL (0.34 mmol/L), 
14 mg/dL (0.36 mmol/L) 
in a 2017 meta-analysis of 19 
respectively (14). Similarly, 
clinical trials, vegetarian diets reduced total and LDL-choles- 
terol 
12.2 mg/dL 
(0.32 mmol/L), respectively (32). 




The systolic-blood-pressure-lowering effect was greater 
with the Mediterranean diet, which may be attributable to 
its high content of monounsaturated fat and vitamin E, and 
virgin olive oil’s ability to increase antioxidant capacity 
(33–35). A randomized trial in 164 adults with prehyperten- 
sion demonstrated that partial substitution of carbohydrate 
with monounsaturated fat modestly reduced blood pressure 
(34). In the PREDIMED study, participants allocated to 
either of the two Mediterranean diet groups, with extra vir- 
gin olive oil or with nuts, had significantly lower diastolic 
blood pressure than the participants in the control group 
(36). Four tablespoons of olive oil provide 52% of the rec- 
ommended dietary allowance of vitamin E. Vitamin E has 
been shown to increase oxidative resistance and the con- 
sumption of foods rich in vitamin E has been associated 
with lower risk of coronary heart disease (35). A 3-year 
randomized clinical study showed that a Mediterranean diet 
rich in olive oil was associated with high levels of plasma 
antioxidant capacity (33). 
Plant-based diets also reduce blood pressure, presumably 
due to reductions in blood viscosity and body weight, and 
their high potassium content (37). In a meta-analysis of 7 
clinical trials using vegetarian and vegan diets, systolic blood 
pressure was reduced by 4.8 mm Hg and diastolic blood 
pressure by 2.2 mm Hg (15). 
In research studies, the acceptability of plant-based diets 
is similar to that of other therapeutic diets over both the 
short and long term, as indicated by rates of retention, diet 
(38–41). 
adherence, and diet acceptance questionnaires 
Likewise, self-reports and objective measures indicate gener- 
ally good adherence to the Mediterranean diet (4). 
This study has several strengths, including a methodo- 
logically efficient cross-over design and weekly participant 
follow-up to facilitate dietary adherence. Despite the length 
of the trial, retention was reasonably strong (84%). Because 
the participants were not confined to a metabolic ward, the 
results can readily translate to nonclinical settings. 
The study also has limitations. Although self-reported 
overall adherence to both diets was high, it is impossible to 
eliminate uncertainty regarding participants’ adherence. The 


improvements in most cardiometabolic outcomes were more 
pronounced on both diets during the first study period (rep- 
resenting the change from baseline) than the second study 
period, 
largely because baseline mean body weight was 
higher than that after the washout period. Nonetheless, 
weight loss was observed on the vegan diet in both phases 
of the study with no carryover effect. Self-reported energy 
intake was lower on both diets in the first period compared 
to the second one, however, as noted above, estimates of 
treatment effect were in general largely consistent between 
the two study periods. While the study duration was suffi- 
cient 
to allow the participants to experience metabolic 
changes, a longer duration would have provided more evi- 
dence about the long-term cardiometabolic effects of both 
diets. Metabolic adaptation to changes in macronutrient 
intake, particularly to lower carbohydrate intake, has been 
previously shown to be affected by the study duration. In a 
meta-analysis of 29 trials testing the effects of diets varying 
in carbohydrate content, total energy expenditure appeared 
to require approximately 2.5 weeks to respond to the dietary 
intervention and other metabolic measures may take longer, 
suggesting value of studies with longer durations (42). 
In conclusion, this 36-week randomized cross-over trial 
showed that a low-fat plant-based diet reduced body weight, 
fat mass, and visceral fat, increased insulin sensitivity, and 
improved blood lipids, compared with a Mediterranean diet. 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased more on the 
Mediterranean diet.
