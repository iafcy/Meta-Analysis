Aims The aim of this study was to compare the effects of calorie-restricted vegetarian and conventional diabetic diets alone and 
in combination with exercise on insulin resistance, visceral fat and oxidative stress markers in subjects with Type 2 diabetes. 
Methods A 24-week, randomized, open, parallel design was used. Seventy-four patients with Type 2 diabetes were randomly 
assigned to either the experimental group (n = 37), which received a vegetarian diet, or the control group (n = 37), which 
received a conventional diabetic diet. Both diets were isocaloric, calorie restricted (-500 kcal ⁄ day). All meals during the study 
were provided. The second 12 weeks of the diet were combined with aerobic exercise. Participants were examined at baseline, 
12 weeks and 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were: insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic clamp; 
volume of visceral and subcutaneous fat measured by magnetic resonance imaging; and oxidative stress measured by 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Analyses were by intention to treat. 
Results Forty-three per cent of participants in the experimental group and 5% of participants in the control group reduced 
diabetes medication (P < 0.001). Body weight decreased more in the experimental group than in the control group [–6.2 kg 
(95% CI –6.6 to –5.3) vs. –3.2 kg (95% CI –3.7 to –2.5); interaction group · time P = 0.001]. An increase in insulin sensitivity 
was signiﬁcantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group [30% (95% CI 24.5–39) vs. 20% 
(95% CI 14–25), P = 0.04]. A reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fat was greater in the experimental group than 
in the control group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.02, respectively). Plasma adiponectin increased (P = 0.02) and leptin decreased 
(P = 0.02) in the experimental group, with no change in the control group. Vitamin C, superoxide dismutase and reduced 
glutathione increased in the experimental group (P = 0.002, P < 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively). Differences between groups 
were greater after the addition of exercise training. Changes in insulin sensitivity and enzymatic oxidative stress markers 
correlated with changes in visceral fat. 
Conclusions A calorie-restricted vegetarian diet had greater capacity to improve insulin sensitivity compared with a 
conventional diabetic diet over 24 weeks. The greater loss of visceral fat and improvements in plasma concentrations of 
adipokines and oxidative stress markers with this diet may be responsible for the reduction of insulin resistance. The addition of 
exercise training further augmented the improved outcomes with the vegetarian diet.

Type 2 diabetes is only half as prevalent in vegetarians compared 
with non-vegetarians [1,2]. Randomized controlled intervention 
studies in patients with Type 2 diabetes have shown greater 
weight loss, reduction in fasting plasma glucose [3], greater 
improvements in HbA1c and fasting and postprandial lipids [4,5], 
and reduction of diabetes medications [3–5] with vegetarian diets

compared with more conventional diets used to treat diabetes. 
The mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. 
Exercise training reduces insulin resistance by a number of 
mechanisms: preferential loss of visceral fat, stimulation of 
muscle development, increased skeletal muscle insulin action, 
morphological changes in muscle and improved control over 
hepatic glucose production [6]. To our knowledge, the effects of 
the combination of a vegetarian diet and exercise training 
compared with conventional diets in combination with exercise 
training on insulin resistance, resting energy expenditure and 
volume of visceral fat in patients with Type 2 diabetes have not 
yet been studied. 
The aim of our study was to compare the effects of isocaloric, 
calorie-restricted vegetarian and conventional diabetic diets on 
insulin resistance, volume of visceral fat and plasma markers of 
oxidative stress after a 3-month dietary-intervention phase and to 
test whether the positive changes will be sustainable or even 
augmented after adding aerobic exercise training for an 
additional 3 months. Our hypothesis was that a vegetarian diet 
would be more effective in reducing insulin resistance and 
volume of visceral fat and improving oxidative stress markers 
than a conventional diabetic diet and there would be a further 
enhancement of the difference between groups after the addition 
of exercise training. 


Subjects with Type 2 diabetes treated by oral hypoglycaemic 
agents were recruited from February to May 2008. Inclusion 
criteria were: Type 2 diabetes, age 30–70 years, HbA1c between 
6 and 11% (42–97 mmol ⁄ mol), BMI between 25 and 53 kg ⁄ m2, 
and willingness to change dietary habits and follow a prescribed 
exercise programme. Exclusion criteria were HbA1c < 6% 
(< 42 mmol ⁄ mol) or > 11% (> 97 mmol ⁄ mol), use of insulin, 
abuse of alcohol or drugs, pregnancy, lactation, or current use of 
a vegetarian diet. Out of 161 patients pre-chosen by their 
endocrinologists, 74 met the inclusion criteria and gave written 
informed consent (Fig. 1, Table 1).

A 24-week, randomized, open, parallel, metabolically controlled 
design was used. The subjects were randomly assigned to either 
the experimental group (n = 37), which received a vegetarian 
diet, or the control group (n = 37), which received a conventional 
diabetic diet. Both diets were designed to be isocaloric and calorie 
restricted (-500 kcal ⁄ day), with caloric intakes based on the 
measurement of resting energy expenditure of each subject by 
indirect calorimetry (metabolic monitor VMAX; Sensor Medics, 
Anaheim, CA, USA) [7]. The second 12 weeks of the diet were 
combined with aerobic exercise. All participants started with a 
1-week tutorial, where they learned in detail how to compose and 
prepare their diet. Participants attended weekly 1-h meetings 
with lectures and cooking classes. All meals during the study were 
provided. Participants were examined at baseline, 12 weeks and 
24 weeks. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional 
Ethics Committee. 

The vegetarian diet ((cid:3)60% of energy from carbohydrates, 15% 
protein and 25% fat) consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, 
fruits and nuts. Animal products were limited to maximum of 
one portion of low-fat yogurt a day. The conventional diabetic 
diet was administered according to the dietary guidelines of the 
Diabetes and Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) of the European 
Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD). It contained 50% 
of total energy from carbohydrates, 20% protein, less than 30% 
fat (£ 7% saturated fat, < 200 mg ⁄ day of cholesterol ⁄ day). 
Vegetarian meals were provided in two vegetarian restaurants 
and the conventional diabetic diet meals were provided at the 
Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague. To 
meet the vitamin B12 needs of the experimental group, while 
maintaining the same level of intervention in the two groups, 
vitamin B12 was supplemented in both the experimental group 
and the control group (50 lg ⁄ day). Alcoholic beverages were 
limited to one per day for women and two per day for men. 
Participants were asked not to alter their exercise habits during 
the ﬁrst 12 weeks. During weeks 13–24 they were prescribed an 
individualized exercise programme based on their history of 
physical activity and an initial spiroergometric examination. 
Participants exercised at 60% of their maximal heart rate twice a 
week for 1 h under professional supervision, plus once a week at 
home or at the sports centre with the same intensity; they were 
given a sport-tester Polar FT4 (Polar, Kempele, Finnland) and a 
pedometer 
for 
(Omron HJ-113, Omron, Kyoto, 
individual physical activities and were repeatedly instructed on 
how to use them. 


Records of all visits to pick up meals were kept. At weeks 0, 
12 and 24, a 3-day dietary record was completed by each 
participant (two weekdays and one weekend day). A registered 
dietician analysed all 3-day dietary records using a country- 
speciﬁc food-nutrient database [8]. At weeks 3, 8, 14 and 19, 
a registered dietician made unannounced telephone calls and 
each participant recalled his or her 24-h diet. This data set was 
not statistically analysed, but allowed the investigators to 
check the adherence and to provide additional counselling. 
Participants were divided according to their adherence to the 
prescribed diet into the high, medium or low adherence group. 
High adherence was deﬁned as the average daily energy intake 
being no more than 100 kcal 
the intake 
in 
prescribed; medium adherence was less than 200 kcal 
excess. If criteria for neither high nor medium adherence were 
met, the participants were included in the low adherence 
group. An additional criterion for high adherence to the 
vegetarian diet was the average daily cholesterol intake being 
£ 50 mg and, for medium adherence, being less than 100 mg. 
In the control group, the average daily cholesterol limit was 
£ 200 mg for high adherence and less than 300 mg for 
medium adherence.

Physical activity was assessed by pedometer Omron HJ-113 
(Omron, Kyoto, Japan); each participant completed a 3-day 
record, two weekdays and one weekend day, and with two 
questionnaires: the International Physical Activity Question- 
naire (IPAQ) [9] and the Baecke questionnaire [10] at weeks 0, 
12 and 24. Records of each participant’s visits to the sports 
centre were kept. Adherence to the exercise programme was 
deﬁned as more than 75% of prescribed visits to the centre 
(18 ⁄ 24). 

Quality of life was assessed using two questionnaires: Obesity 
and Weight-Loss Quality-of-Life (OWLQOL) and Weight- 
Related Symptoms (WRSM) [11]. 


Participants were asked to continue their pre-existing medication 
regimens, except when hypoglycaemia occurred repeatedly 
laboratory 
(fasting plasma glucose determined at 
)1 
< 4.4 mmol l 
accompanied by hypoglycaemic symptoms). In such cases, 
medications were reduced by a study physician following the 
medication protocol. All participants were given an Accu-Chek 
Go glucometer (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and were instructed 
on how to use it. 


All measurements were performed at 0, 12 and 24 weeks on an 
outpatient basis, after 10- to 12-h overnight fasting with only tap 
water allowed ad libitum. Height and weight were measured 
using a periodically calibrated scale accurate to 0.1 kg. Waist 
circumference was measured with a tape measure placed at the 
midpoint between the lowest rib and the upper part of the iliac 
bone. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured after 
participants had rested in a seated position for 5 min using a 
digital M6 Comfort monitor (Omron, Kyoto, Japan). Three 
measurements were taken at 2-min intervals. The ﬁrst 
measurement was disregarded and a mean value was 
calculated for the remaining two measurements. 
time ⁄ echo time (TR ⁄ TE) = 450 ⁄ 10 ms and thickness of 10 mm 
were acquired during breath-hold. The post-processing of 
magnetic resonance images with the calculation of subcutane- 
ous and visceral abdominal fat volume was carried out in 
MATLAB (The Math Works, Natick, MA, USA); the inner 
region was detected semi- 
border of 
the subcutaneous 
automatically [13], while the abdominal 
fat voxels were 
selected by thresholding. 

Plasma glucose was analysed using the Beckman Analyzer 
glucose–oxidase method (Beckman Instruments Inc., Fullerton, 
CA, USA). Plasma immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide 
concentrations were determined using Insulin and C-peptide 
IRMA kits (Immunotech, Prague, Czech Republic). HbA1c was 
measured by HPLC (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma lipid 
concentrations were measured by enzymatic methods (Roche). 
HDL cholesterol was measured after double precipitation with 
dextran and magnesium chloride. LDL cholesterol was estimated 
using the Friedewald equation if triglyceride concentration was 
within normal limits. 
Oxidative stress markers 
The amount of 
lipid peroxidation was determined as 
thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) [14] using 
home-made kits. The activity of 
superoxide dismutase, 
catalase, seleno-dependent glutathione peroxidase and the level 
of ascorbic acid were analysed by standard methods [15,16] 
using the following kits: superoxide dismutase assay kit (Sigma- 
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), catalase and glutathione 
peroxidase assay kits (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, 
USA) and home-made kits for ascorbic acid. Glutathione 
reductase activity was measured by the decrease of NADPH 
(Sigma-Aldrich). The whole blood level of reduced glutathione 
was determined by the Glutathione HPLC Kit in whole blood 
(Chromsystems, Munich, Germany). 
Adipokines 
Plasma concentrations of total adiponectin and resistin were 
measured using ELISA kits (Raybiotech, Norcross, GA, USA), 
high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin using ELISA kits 
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and leptin using Milliplex 
(Millipore). 
Hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic clamp 
)1) isoglycaemic clamp, 
)1 min 
The hyperinsulinaemic (1 mU kg 
lasting 3 h, was conducted as previously described [12]. Insulin 
sensitivity was estimated as the metabolic clearance rate of 
glucose (MCR) calculated during the last 20 min of the clamp 
after correction for changes in glucose pool size [12]. 
Magnetic resonance imaging 
Twenty-seven water-suppressed magnetic resonance images 
centred to the intervertebral disc of L2 ⁄ L3 with repetition 

The intention-to-treat analysis 
included all participants. 
Repeated-measures ANOVA models with between-subject 
and within-subject factors and interactions were used for 
evaluation of the relationships between continuous variables 
and factors. Factors groups, subject and time, were included in 
the model. Interactions between group and time (group · time) 
were calculated for each variable. Within each group, paired 
comparison t-tests were calculated to test whether the changes

from baseline to 3 months, from baseline to 24 weeks and 
from 12 to 24 weeks were statistically signiﬁcant. The v2-test 
was used for evaluation of qualitative variables. Pearson 
correlations were calculated for the relationship between 
changes in the metabolic clearance rate of glucose and 
oxidative 
in volume of 
visceral fat. Data are presented as mean (cid:2) sd and mean with 
95% CI. 


Ninety-two per cent of the participants completed the ﬁrst 
12 weeks (95% in the experimental group and 89% in the 
control group); 84% of 
the participants in each group 
completed all 24 weeks. Adherence to the prescribed diet at 
24 weeks was high among 55% participants 
in the 
experimental group and 32% in the control group, medium 
among 22.5% in the experimental group and 39% in the 
control group, and low among 22.5% in the experimental 
group and 29% in the control group. Pedometer readings and 
self-reported energy expenditure 
showed no signiﬁcant 
between-group differences. Adherence to the prescribed 
exercise program was 85.5% (90.3% in the experimental 
group and 80.6% in the control group). 

Baseline dietary intake and its changes are shown in Tables 1 and 
2. Both groups reduced energy intake (P < 0.001 for each group). 
Percentage of consumed carbohydrates (out of daily caloric 
intake) increased in the experimental group (P = 0.002), with no 
change in the control group. Percentage of consumed fats 
decreased in both groups (P = 0.03). Percentage of consumed 
proteins decreased in the experimental group (P < 0.001).

Regression analyses showed that changes in volume of visceral fat

rate of glucose and plasma concentrations of enzymatic oxidative 
stress markers; each kilogram of lost visceral fat was associated 
with increases in the metabolic clearance rate of glucose by

reduced glutathione by 0.9 mmol l 
of metabolic clearance rate of glucose change with change in 
volume of visceral fat was r = –0.63; P < 0.001. Correlations 
between the changes in the volume of visceral fat and both the 
changes in superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione were 
r = –0.55; P < 0.001 and r = –0.45; P = 0.02, respectively. 



Plasma concentrations of both total and high-molecular weight

We found that a calorie-restricted vegetarian diet increased 
insulin sensitivity, reduced volume of visceral fat and improved 
plasma concentrations of adipokines and oxidative stress 
markers more than a conventional diet in patients with Type 2 
diabetes over 24 weeks. The addition of exercise training further 
augmented the improved outcomes with our vegetarian diet. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that has 
elucidated the effect of a vegetarian diet and a vegetarian diet plus 
exercise on these variables.. The advantageous effects of a 
vegetarian diet may be partly explained by weight loss, especially

Several possible mechanisms may explain the beneﬁcial effects 
of a vegetarian diet [17]: higher intake of ﬁbre [18], lower intake 
of saturated fat [and a higher polyunsaturated and saturated fatty 
acid (P ⁄ S) ratio] [19], higher intake of non-heme iron and 
reduction in iron stores [20], higher intake of vegetable protein in 
place of animal protein [21], higher intake of antioxidants [22]

and plant sterols [23]. A vegetarian diet was reported to reduce 
intramyocellular lipid concentrations [24] and this, together with 
the effect on visceral fat which we observed, might be responsible 
for a substantial portion of the effect of a vegetarian diet on 
insulin sensitivity and enzymatic oxidative stress markers. 
Our data suggest that a vegetarian diet leads to a complex 
improvement of enzymatic and non-enzymatic oxidative stress 
markers. Both enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant 
defence mechanisms work in synergy against different types of 
free radicals [25], which play a major role in the development and 
progression of diabetes and its complications [26]. The changes 
we observed in plasma concentrations of adipokines reﬂect loss 
of adipose tissue. 
The reduction in LDL cholesterol observed with our 
vegetarian diet is in concordance with previous studies where 
vegetarian diets have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol [4] 
lipids [27] and to reverse atherosclerosis 
and postprandial 
progression [28]. Of interest is the different dynamics of 
changes in HDL cholesterol (although the difference between 
groups was not signiﬁcant): whereas it increased in the control 
group from baseline to 6 months with no signiﬁcant increase in 
either period, it increased in the experimental group only after the 
addition of exercise. Previous studies have shown no increase or 
even a decrease in HDL cholesterol with vegetarian diets; 
however, this decrease is less than that seen with LDL cholesterol. 
Isolated increases in HDL cholesterol observed in other diets do 
not confer the same beneﬁts [29]. 
The strengths of our study include the parallel design, in which 
all participants started simultaneously, allowing the investigators 
to use weekly meetings in both groups to encourage further 
compliance. Providing all meals for the participants and 
exercising under professional supervision ensured the best 
possible compliance. The study duration was long enough to 
allow sufﬁcient time for adaptation to the diet. The study 
investigated several metabolic variables, with the results 
applicable outside of the research setting. 
We are aware of several limitations of our study. The number 
of subjects did not provide sufﬁcient power to conﬁrm the 
superior effect of the vegetarian diet on HbA1c, as observed by 
Barnard et al. [4]. Lower adherence to the prescribed diet in the 
control group after the addition of exercise points to a potential 
weakness of the conventional diabetic diet: portion size limits 
may have increased feelings of hunger during exercise, leading 
subjects to exceed their prescribed energy intake limits. 
The limited adherence to the conventional diabetic diet has 
been a well-documented problem in dietary intervention studies 
[4,30]. Especially during exercise, it became evident in our trial 
that it was easier for subjects to follow a vegetarian diet than a 
conventional diabetic diet. This may be partly responsible for 
the greater reduction in volume of visceral fat and insulin 
resistance with the vegetarian diet after aerobic exercise. 
In conclusion, our results indicate that a vegetarian diet alone 
or in combination with exercise is more effective in increasing 
insulin sensitivity, reducing volume of visceral fat and improving 
plasma concentrations of adipokines and oxidative stress 
markers than a conventional diabetic diet with or without the 
addition of exercise. Vegetarian diets may provide a beneﬁcial 
alternative for nutritional therapy in Type 2 diabetes, especially 
in combination with aerobic exercise. Further studies should 
explore the precise mechanisms and long-term effects of 
vegetarian diets in patients with Type 2 diabetes.
