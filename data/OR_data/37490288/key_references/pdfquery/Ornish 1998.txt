Intensive Lifestyle Changes for Reversal 
of Coronary Heart Disease 






Objectives.—To determine the feasibility of patients to sustain intensive lifestyle 
changes for a total of 5 years and the effects of these lifestyle changes (without 
lipid-lowering drugs) on coronary heart disease. 


Patients.—Forty-eight patients with moderate to severe coronary heart disease 
were randomized to an intensive lifestyle change group or to a usual-care control 
group, and 35 completed the 5-year follow-up quantitative coronary arteriography. 
Setting.—Two tertiary care university medical centers. 
Intervention.—Intensive lifestyle changes (10% fat whole foods vegetarian diet, 
aerobic exercise, stress management training, smoking cessation, group psycho- 
social support) for 5 years. 


Results.—Experimental group patients (20 [71%] of 28 patients completed 
5-year follow-up) made and maintained comprehensive lifestyle changes for 5 
years, whereas control group patients (15 [75%] of 20 patients completed 5-year 
follow-up) made more moderate changes. In the experimental group, the average 
percent diameter stenosis at baseline decreased 1.75 absolute percentage points 
after 1 year (a 4.5% relative improvement) and by 3.1 absolute percentage points 
after 5 years (a 7.9% relative improvement). In contrast, the average percent diam- 
eter stenosis in the control group increased by 2.3 percentage points after 1 year 
(a 5.4% relative worsening) and by 11.8 percentage points after 5 years (a 27.7% 
relative worsening) (P= .001 between groups. Twenty-ﬁve cardiac events occurred 
in 28 experimental group patients vs 45 events in 20 control group patients during 
the 5-year follow-up (risk ratio for any event for the control group, 2.47 [95% con- 
ﬁdence interval, 1.48-4.20]). 
Conclusions.—More regression of coronary atherosclerosis occurred after 5 
years than after 1 year in the experimental group. In contrast, in the control group, 
coronary atherosclerosis continued to progress and more than twice as many car- 
diac events occurred.

THE LIFESTYLE Heart Trial was the 
first randomized clinical trial to investi- 
gate whether ambulatory patients could 
be motivated to make and sustain com- 
prehensive lifestyle changes and, if so, 
whether the progression of coronary 
atherosclerosis could be stopped or re- 
versed without using lipid-lowering 
drugs as measured by computer-as- 
sisted quantitative coronary arteriogra- 
phy. This study derived from earlier 
studies that used noninvasive mea- 
sures.1,2 
After 1 year, we found that experi- 
mental group participants were able to 
make and maintain intensive lifestyle 
changes and had a 37.2% reduction in 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles- 
terol levels and a 91% reduction in the 
frequency of anginal episodes.3 Average 
percent diameter stenosis regressed 
from 40.0% at baseline to 37.8% 1 year 
later, a change that was correlated with 
the degree of lifestyle change. In con- 
trast, patients in the usual-care control 
group made more moderate changes in 
lifestyle, reduced LDL cholesterol lev- 
els by 6%, and had a 165% increase in the 
frequency of reported anginal episodes. 
Average percent diameter stenosis pro- 
gressed from 42.7% to 46.1%. 
Given these encouraging findings, 
we extended the study for an additional 
4 years to determine (1) the feasibility 
of patients sustaining intensive changes 
in diet and lifestyle for a much longer 
time, and (2) the effects of these changes 
on risk factors, coronary atherosclero- 
sis, myocardial perfusion, and cardiac 
events after 4 additional years. 

The design, recruitment, and study 
population were previously described.3-5

with coronary atherosclerosis docu- 
mented by quantitative coronary arte- 
riography. 
We identified 193 patients as poten- 
tially eligible for our study who agreed 
to undergo quantitative coronary angi- 
ography. Following angiography, 93 
patients remained eligible and were ran- 
domly assigned to experimental or con- 
trol groups using a randomized invita- 
tional design to minimize crossover, 
ethical concerns, nocebo effects, and 
dropout. Of these 93 patients who were 
eligible, 53 were randomly assigned to 
the experimental group and 40 to the 
usual-care control group. Patients were 
then contacted and invited to participate 
in the study; 28 (53%) and 20 (50%) 
agreed to participate in the experimen- 
tal and control groups, respectively. The 
primary reason for refusal in the experi- 
mental group was not wanting to un- 
dergo intensive lifestyle changes and/or 
not wanting a second coronary angio- 
gram; control patients refused primarily 
because they did not want to undergo a 
second angiogram. To detect possible se- 
lection biases, we collected data on age, 
marital status, reported angina, history 
of myocardial infarction, height, weight, 
number of diseased lesions, and stenosis 
severity for all patients who were ran- 
domized into the study but refused to 
participate. We did not exclude any ex- 
perimental group patients who volun- 
teered even if we doubted their ability to 
adhere to the lifestyle program. All pa- 
tients who volunteered were followed up 
using the intention-to-treat principle. 
After 1 year, 7 patients did not pro- 
vide angiographic data, and the reasons 
for loss to follow-up have been reported.3 
Of the remaining 41 patients at baseline 
most had severe coronary atherosclero- 
sis: 28 had 3-vessel disease, 12 had 
2-vessel disease, and 1 had 1-vessel 
disease. Two of these patients whose 
angiographic data were not usable after 
1 year agreed to undergo quantitative 
coronary arteriography after 5 years; 
these results are included in the baseline 

Four experimental and 4 control pa- 
tients who had an angiogram at 1 year did 
not have a third angiogram after 5 years. 
Three of these 4 patients in the experi- 
mental group refused a third angiogram 
(patients only volunteered for a 1-year 
study that was subsequently extended), 
and 1 died between years 1 and 4; of the 4 
control group patients who did not un- 
dergo a third angiogram, 1 died, 2 under- 
went revascularization of the arterial 
lesions under study, and 1 developed 
Parkinson disease and became too ill to 
be safely tested. Cine arteriograms made 
in San Francisco, Calif, were sent to the 
University of Texas Medical School, 
Houston, for blinded quantitative analy- 
ses as previously described in detail.4 
All results, except lesion changes at 1 
year (18 experimental and 15 control 
subjects) and cardiac events after 5 
years (all 28 experimental and 20 control 
subjects), are based on the total of 35 
patients (20 experimental and 15 control 
subjects) who had both baseline and 5- 
year angiograms. From these 35 pa- 
tients, there were 224 lesions studied at 
baseline, of which 24 were 100% occluded 
and were excluded a priori from the le- 
sion-change analyses per the study pro- 
tocol. Of the remaining 200 lesions, 14 
were lost to the 4-year follow-up, as fol- 
lows: in the experimental group, 2 le- 
sions were excluded due to technical fail- 
ure during the angiogram and 2 had 
views that did not match; in the control 
group, views did not match for 3 lesions, 
3 lesions were excluded due to technical 
failure, 1 was excluded due to angio- 
plasty, and 3 were excluded due to coro- 
nary artery bypass surgery. Of the 186 
lesions available for analysis at 4 years, 
109 were from the experimental group 
and 77 were from the control group. 
The 1-year original study and the 4- 
year extension were approved by the 
committees on human research at Cali- 
fornia Pacific Medical Center and Uni- 
versity of California, San Francisco, and 
each patient signed a written consent 
form after being fully informed of the 
study requirements. 
Patients completed a 3-day diet diary 
at baseline and after 1 and 5 years to 
assess nutrient intake and dietary ad- 
herence.6 Methods of lipid assays were 
the same as previously reported.3 These 
3-day diet diaries were analyzed with a 
software package (CBORD Diet Ana- 
lyzer; CBORD Group Inc; Ithaca, NY) 
using the US Department of Agricul- 
ture database. Also, patients were asked 
to complete a questionnaire reporting 
the frequency and duration of exercise 
and of each stress management tech- 
nique. Information from these sources 
was quantified into continuous scores us- 
ing an a priori determined formula. The 
adherence measure was a continuous 
score reflecting daily intake of choles- 
terol (in milligrams), fat (in grams), 
frequency and duration of exercise, fre- 
quency and duration of stress manage- 
ment techniques, and smoking. A score 
of 1.0 equalled 100% adherence but 
scores could be greater than 1.0 if par- 
ticipants exceeded the recommended in- 
tensive lifestyle changes. 
The technicians responsible for per- 
forming all medical tests were blinded to 
patient group assignment. Also, different 
personnel implemented the lifestyle in- 
tervention, conducted the tests, and com- 
putedstatisticalanalyses,althoughthedi- 
etitian was made aware of the nutrient 
analysis to monitor patients’ safety and 
adherence. Quantitative coronary arte- 
riograms were blindly analyzed without 
knowledge of group assignment. 

Experimental group patients were 
prescribed an intensive lifestyle pro- 
gram that included a 10%-fat vegetarian 
diet, moderate aerobic exercise, stress 
management training, smoking cessa- 
tion, and group psychosocial support 
previously described in detail.3,7-10 Pa- 
tients were encouraged to avoid simple 
sugars and to emphasize the intake of 
complex carbohydrates and other whole 
foods. Only 1 patient in the experimental 
group was actively smoking at baseline, 
and she quit at entry. Control group pa- 
tients were asked to follow the advice of 
their personal physicians regarding life- 
style changes. 

We decided a priori to use percent di- 
ameter stenosis as the primary depen- 
dent variable. Statistical methods to 
compare the 2 groups were previously 
described.3 Analysis of adherence vari- 
ables and risk factor levels used time- 
structured repeated measures in which 
levels from all 3 measurement times 
(baseline, 1 year, and 5 years) were in-

*CI indicates conﬁdence interval. 
†All P levels are 2-tailed and each is a result of a test of the null hypothesis that the change between 2 particular visits (eg, baseline and 1 year) does not differ between 

cluded in a single regression model. Sta- 
tistical significances of group differences 
were obtained for baseline levels, 1-year 
changes, and 5-year changes using F 
tests. All repeated measures analyses 
were implemented using PROC MIXED 
under SAS version 6.08.11 Analysis of le- 
sion data used a repeated measures 
model in which the repeated measures 
were baseline or change values for mul- 
tiple lesions within each subject. Change 
scores were used for the baseline to 1- 
year and baseline to 5-year follow-up pe- 
riods, and analysis of baseline levels, 1- 
year changes, and 5-year changes were 
done separately. Again, F tests provided 
by SAS PROC MIXED were used to test 
significance of differences between 
groups with respect to baseline levels, 
1-year changes, and 5-year changes. The 
SAS PROC MIXED linear regression, 
which allowed for dependence in data, 
was used to determine the relationship 
between adherence and percent diam- 
eter stenosis changes. Relative rates for 
cardiac events were analyzed and tested 
by Poisson regression using exact tests 
(Stata 5.0, College Station, Tex). 
RESULTS 
Baseline Comparisons 
of Volunteers With Refusals 
Those who declined the invitation to 
be in the study were similar to those who 
volunteered in all available data except 
those who volunteered were more likely 
to have a history of angina (87% vs 65%; 
P = .02), a greater number of lesions (4.5 
vs 3.5; P = .04), and slightly more se- 
verely stenosed lesions (2.3 vs 2.0 on a 
3-point scale; P = .05). 
Baseline Comparisons 
of Experimental Group 
With Control Group 
Analyses across the 35 volunteers at 
baseline for whom 4-year lesion data 
were available showed no significant dif- 
ferences between the experimental 
group and the control group in demo- 
graphic characteristics, history of myo- 
cardial infarction, angioplasty, bypass 
surgery, lesion number, lesion stenosis, 
dietary fat or cholesterol intake, exer- 
cise and stress management practice, 
blood pressure, exercise capacity, and 
psychosocial measures (Tables 1-3). 
Among the many comparisons, only a 
few differed significantly (P(cid:44).05). More 
women were randomly assigned to the 
control group (4) than to the experimen- 
tal group (1); this fact accounted for half 
the weight difference (10 kg) between 
the 2 groups and most of the height dif- 
ference (6 cm). 
Experimental group patients had a 
slightly larger body mass index (mea- 
sured as the weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters) 
(28.4 vs 25.4 kg/m2; P = .03) and had lower 
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles- 
terol levels (1.04 mmol/L [40.1 mg/dL] vs 
1.36 mmol/L [52.4 mg/dL]; P = .04), 
which was also reflected in lower apoli- 
poprotein A-I levels (3.45 mmol/L [133.1 
mg/dL] vs 4.08 mmol/L [157.5 mg/dL]; 
P = .03). The lower body mass index in 
the control group may be due to the 
larger number of women in the control 
group. Other lipid values, including ra- 
tios of total cholesterol to HDL and LDL 
to HDL, did not differ significantly at 
baseline (Table 4). 

In the experimental group, adherence 
to all aspects of the program was excel- 
lent during the first year and good after 5 
years, whereas control group patients 
maintained more moderate changes dur- 
ing the 5 years consistent with conven- 
tional guidelines (Table 2). The percent- 
age of daily energy (calories) provided by 
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, soy, 
other legumes, nonfat dairy, and alcohol 
was comparable at 1 year and at 5 years. 
In the experimental group, fat intake 
decreased from approximately 30% to 
8.5%, cholesterol from 211 to 18.6 mg/d, 
energy from 8159 to 7724 J (1950-1846 
cal), protein from 17% to 15%, and carbo- 
hydrates increased from 53% to 76.5%. In

the control group, fat intake decreased 
from 30% to 25%, cholesterol from 212.5 
to 138.7 mg/d, energy from 5.49 to 3.59 J 
(1711-1573 cal), protein from 19% to 18%, 
and carbohydrates increased from 51% to 
52%. Since patients volunteered origi- 
nally only for a 1-year study, there was a 
significant decrease in meeting atten- 
dance after 1 year for 4 of the patients. 
Walking was the recommended form of 
exercise, but some patients jogged or did 
more strenuous exercise. 

Patients in the experimental group 
lost 10.9 kg (23.9 lbs) at 1 year and sus- 
tained a weight loss of 5.8 kg (12.8 lbs) at 
5 years, whereas weight in the control 
group changed little from baseline. In 
the experimental group, LDL choles- 
terol levels decreased by 40% at 1 year 
and remained 20% below baseline at 5 
years. In the control group, LDL choles- 
terol levels decreased by 1.2% at 1 year 
and by 19.3% at 5 years. There were no 
statistically significant differences in 
LDL levels between the 2 groups at 5 
years, primarily because 9 (60%) of 
15 control patients took lipid-lowering 
drugs between year 1 and year 5 of the 
study. None of the experimental group 
patients took lipid-lowering drugs dur- 
ing the 5 years of the study. Fourteen 
patients in the experimental group and 
11 patients in the control group took as- 
pirin during the study. 
Triglycerides did not change signifi- 
cantly in either group. Apolipoprotein 
A-I did not change in the experimental 
group, but it increased in the control 
group (P = .04). High-density lipoprotein 
levels and blood pressure did not differ 
between the 2 groups. 

Experimental group patients had a 
91% reduction in reported frequency of 
angina after 1 year and a 72% reduction 
after 5 years (Table 5). In contrast, con- 
trol group patients had a 186% increase 
in reported frequency of angina after 1 
year and a 36% decrease in frequency 
after 5 years. The decrease in angina in 
the control group after 5 years was in 
large part because 3 of the 5 patients 
who reported an increase in anginal epi- 
sodes from baseline to 1 year underwent 
coronary angioplasty between years 1 
and 5. Because of this reduction in angina 
in control group patients who under- 
went revascularization, the between- 
group differences were no longer signifi- 
cant after 5 years (Table 5). 

All detectable lesions that matched at 
baseline and 5-year follow-up and were 
not 100% occluded at baseline were in- 
cluded in the analyses (n = 186). At base- 
line, there were no significant differ- 
ences between the experimental and 
control groups in any measure of lesion 
severity (Table 3). In the experimental 
group, the average percent diameter 
stenosis at baseline decreased 1.75 ab- 
solute percentage points after 1 year (a 
4.5% relative improvement) and by 3.1 
absolute percentage points after 5 years 
(a 7.9% relative improvement). In con- 
trast, the average percent diameter ste- 
nosis in the control group increased by 
2.3 percentage points after 1 year (a 5.4% 
relative worsening) and by 11.8 percent- 
age points after 5 years (a 27.7% relative 
worsening). These between-group dif- 
ferences were statistically significant af- 
ter both 1 year and 5 years (P = .02 and 
P = .001, respectively, Figure 1). 
Figure 2 shows the experimental 
group changes in percent diameter ste- 
nosis from baseline to 5 years according 
to tertiles of adherence to the lifestyle 
intervention. As seen at 1 year,3 there 
was also a strong correlation between 
adherence and percent diameter steno- 
sis after 5 years in a dose-response rela- 
tionship; the tertile of patients that was 
most adherent to the program had the 
most regression, the tertile with inter- 
mediate adherence had less regression, 
and the tertile with the least adherence 
halted the progression of disease with- 
out regression (P = .04). Of interest is 
that this relationship was not related to 
age or disease severity. There was no 
significant relationship between adher- 
ence and lesion changes in the control 
group, perhaps because many of these 
patients began taking lipid-lowering 
drugs, which may have confounded the 
ability to detect a possible relationship. 
Indeed, we found significant correla- 
tions between changes in lipid levels 
(LDL and total cholesterol) and changes

reduces LDL cholesterol by only 5% or 
less.20,21 
High-density lipoprotein levels de- 
creased and triglycerides increased in 
experimental group patients overall, al- 
though the ratio of LDL to HDL was 
improved. Recent reports assert that 
this phenomenon, which is often seen in 
very low-fat diets, may be harmful.22,23 
However, patients in the Lifestyle 
Heart Trial showed even more regres- 
sion of coronary atherosclerosis after 5 
years than after 1 year as well as signifi-

in lesions in both groups. These correla- 
tions remained significant when exam- 
ining either the lipid values at 5 years or 
the change in lipid values from baseline 
to 5 years. 
As a secondary analysis, we examined 
the results in control group patients who 
began taking lipid-lowering drugs during 
the study. Percent diameter stenosis pro- 
gressed from 45.7% to 51.7%, a change of 
6.0 absolute percentage points. In the con- 
trol patients who did not take lipid-low- 
ering drugs the disease progressed from 
40.7% to 59.7%, a much greater change of 
19.0 absolute percentage points. (No ex- 
perimental group patients took lipid-low- 
ering drugs during the study.) 
The change in body mass index from 
baseline to 1 year (r = −0.85; P(cid:44).001) 
and from baseline to 5 years (r = −0.72; 
P = .001) was significantly correlated with 
the change in percent diameter stenosis 
in the control group only. In other words, 
those who gained weight were more likely 
to show progression of atherosclerosis. 

Data on cardiac events were obtained 
from all 48 patients. Cardiac events in- 
cluded myocardial infarction, coronary 
angioplasty, coronary artery bypass sur- 
gery, cardiac-related hospitalizations, 
and cardiac-related deaths. At 5 years, 
there were more cardiac events in the 
control group (45 events for 20 patients, 
or 2.25 events per patient) than the ex- 
perimental group (25 events for 28 pa- 
tients, or 0.89 events per patient) (Table 
6). Control group patients were more 
likely to have undergone coronary angi- 
oplasty and bypass surgery and/or to 
have been hospitalized for cardiac-re- 
lated problems than were experimental 
group patients. 

The primary end point of this study, 
chosen a priori, was percent diameter 
stenosis. On average, there was more re- 
duction (continued improvement) after 
5 years than after 1 year in experimental 
group patients who were asked to make 
intensive lifestyle changes. In contrast, 
control group patients showed much 
more progression (continued worsening) 
in average percent diameter stenosis af- 
ter 5 years than after 1 year, even though 
more than half of the control group pa- 
tients were prescribed lipid-lowering 
medications during the course of the 
study. Although the sample size was 
relative small,12 these differences were 
statistically significant at both 1 year 
and 5 years. These findings support the 
feasibility of intensive lifestyle changes 
in delaying, stopping, or reversing the 
progression of coronary artery disease 
in ambulatory patients over prolonged 
periods. 
We found more than twice as many 
cardiac events per patient in the control 
group than in the experimental group. 
These findings are consistent with other 
clinical trials showing that even small 
changes in percent diameter stenosis are 
often accompanied by marked reduc- 
tions in cardiac events.13-16 Other studies 
have demonstrated how quickly the 
coronary artery endothelium stabilizes 
in response to lipid-lowering drugs.17,18 
Although there was some reduction in 
adherence to the intensive lifestyle in- 
tervention between years 1 and 5 in the 
experimental group, long-term adher- 
ence remained remarkably high in this 
sample of self-selected patients. The 
level of lifestyle change, even at 5 years, 
is greater than in any other published 
study of ambulatory populations. These 
results are especially encouraging be- 
cause these patients initially volun- 
teered to participate for only 1 year 
when they entered the study. 
The experimental group reduced LDL 
cholesterol levels by 40% at 1 year and by 
20% after 5 years; these reductions are 
comparable with those achieved with 
lipid-lowering drugs in an ambulatory

HDL cholesterol levels due to reduced 
fat intake are the result of a decreased 
transport rate rather than the increased 
catabolism that is responsible for most 
cases of low HDL cholesterol levels in 
persons consuming a typical Western 
diet.24 Populations consuming low-fat, 
plant-based diets have low HDL choles- 
terol levels and low rates of coronary 
heart disease. Our data provide evidence 
using quantitative coronary arteriogra- 
phy in this population that diet-induced 
lowering of HDL cholesterol does not 
confer the same risk of atherosclerosis 
as do low HDL cholesterol levels in 
Americans consuming a high-fat diet.25 
Experimental group patients whose tri- 
glycerides increased during the first 
year were asked to minimize their in- 
take of simple carbohydrates, and tri- 
glyceride levels decreased between year 
1 and year 5. 
The experimental group’s marked re- 
duction in frequency, severity, and du- 
ration of angina after 1 year was sus- 
tained at similar levels after 5 years. This 
long-term reduction in angina is compa- 
rable with that achieved following coro- 
nary artery bypass surgery or angio- 
plasty and helps to maintain long-term 
adherence.26 Between-group differences 
in most measures of chest pain were not 
statistically significant after 5 years be- 
cause there was a large variability in an- 
gina and control group patients who 
were the most symptomatic underwent 
revascularization. 
When we began this study, we be- 
lieved that the younger patients with 
milder disease would be more likely to 
show regression, but we did not find this 
to be true. Instead, we found that the pri- 
mary determinant of change in percent 
diameter stenosis in the experimental 
group was neither age nor disease se- 
verity but adherence to the recom- 
mended changes in diet and lifestyle. This 
relationship of adherence to percent di- 
ameter stenosis in the experimental 
group was found after 1 year3 and also af- 
ter 5 years in a dose-response relation- 
ship. Coronary artery minimum diam- 
eter remained stable in the experimental 
group but markedly narrowed in the con- 
trol group during the 5 years of the study. 
At 5 years, the differences between the 
experimental and control groups were 
statistically significant for both percent 
diameter stenosis and minimum diam- 
eter, even though control group pa- 
tients reported risk reduction behavior 
consistent with a Step II diet of the Na- 
tional Cholesterol Education Program 
and the American Heart Association: 
they consumed an average of 25% of en- 
ergy (calories) from fat and exercised an 
average of 3.5 times per week. These data 
are consistent with other studies indi- 
cating that moderate changes in diet and 
lifestyle may not be sufficient to stop the 
progression of coronary atherosclerosis 
unless combined with lipid-lowering 
drugs.27 
After 5 years, the normal diameter 
(the segment of least narrowing proxi- 
mal to the minimum diameter) de- 
creased slightly in the experimental 
group but widened slightly in the control 
group. A slight decrease in normal diam- 
eter, at least up to a point, may improve 
myocardial perfusion by streamlining 
flow—decreasing the forward flow 
losses that occur when going from a 
larger to a sharply reduced lumen diam- 
eter.4 Conversely, the slight increase in 
the normal diameter and reduction in the 
minimum diameter seen in control group 
patients increased the entry angle, fur- 
ther reducing blood flow. These theoreti- 
cal considerations are consistent with 
the substantially increased myocardial 
perfusion in the experimental group and 
decreased myocardial perfusion in the 
control group that we measured using 
cardiac positron emission tomography 
scans.5 
A much earlier study by Morrison28 
found that moderate reductions in fat and 
cholesterol intake improved cardiac sur- 
vival: after 12 years, all of the control 
group patients had died compared with 
only 62% of experimental group pa- 
tients in a nonrandomized trial. More re- 
cently, an important study by Esselstyn 
et al29 reported that a similar diet plus 
lipid-lowering drugs in 11 patients caused 
regression of 11 lesions and stabilization 
in the remaining 14 lesions after 5.5 years. 
Although there was no control group, 
those who were adherent to the diet re- 
ported substantially fewer cardiac events 
than those who were not adherent.29 
Like all clinical trials, our study has 
limitations. Although the study partici- 
pants were a diverse group, they may 
not be representative of the general 
population of patients with coronary 
heart disease. Half of the patients who 
underwent quantitative coronary arte- 
riography in the participatory hospitals 
did not meet all of the inclusion and ex- 
clusion criteria and were not invited to 
participate in the study. Also, half of the 
patients who were invited declined to 
enroll in the study. Nevertheless, it is 
encouraging that 50% of the patients who 
were contacted agreed to volunteer de- 
spite the requirement for repeated arte- 
riography and that experimental group 
patients were able to make and maintain 
comprehensive lifestyle changes. The 
angiographic measures lost to follow-up 
may have affected the treatment and con- 
trol groups differently, although there 
are no data to suggest that this occurred. 
In addition, there is a possibility of dif- 
ferential loss of lesions in patients, al- 
though no evidence indicates that this oc- 
curred; in both groups, there were 14 le- 
sions that were lost to follow-up. Also, 4 
lesions were lost in the control group to 
bypass surgery or angioplasty; since 
these lesions were worsening sufficiently 
to require revascularization, the exclu- 
sion of these lesions from analysis would 
make between-group differences more 
difficult to detect. We recently completed 
a multicenter demonstration project to 
assess the practicality and cost-effective- 
ness of this intervention in a larger 
sample of economically and geographi- 
cally diverse patients with coronary 
heart disease.30 
Although we did not use lipid- 
lowering drugs in the experimental 
group, their value has been demon- 
strated in studies that have been pub- 
lished since the Lifestyle Heart Trial be- 
gan. We do not know if experimental 
group patients may have demonstrated 
even more improvement by including 
lipid-lowering drugs.14-16 Patients in the 
control group who were not prescribed 
lipid-lowering drugs during the study 
showed more than 3 times as much pro- 
gression in percent diameter stenosis as 
those who were. No experimental group 
patients took lipid-lowering drugs dur- 
ing the study, yet they showed better re- 
sults than control group patients who 
w e r e t a k i n g t h e s e d r u g s . L i p i d - 
lowering drugs are expensive, compli- 




ance is difficult to achieve,31 and long- 
term safety is unknown.32 In practice, 
patients may be offered a range of thera- 
peutic options, including comprehen- 
sive lifestyle changes, lipid-lowering drug 
therapy, and revascularization, either 
separately or in combination. 
In summary, these ambulatory pa- 
tients were able to make and maintain 
comprehensive changes in diet and life- 
style for 5 years and showed even more 
regression of coronary atherosclerosis af- 
ter 5 years than after 1 year as mea- 
sured by percent diameter stenosis. In 
contrast, patients following more con- 
ventional lifestyle recommendations 
showed even more progression of coro- 
nary atherosclerosis after 5 years than 
after 1 year, and had more than twice as

counseling and testing data system was begun, and 1 (Florida) 
began HIV reporting very recently and not enough time has 
elapsed to have adequate data for analysis. The year-to-year me- 
dian percentage changes in total number of HIV tests during 
1992 through 1996 for areas with and without HIV reporting 
were similar in magnitude and trend.2 
Although we showed no large declines in testing among MSM 
and other risk groups after HIV reporting, we agree with Arago´ n 
and Myers and Dr Woods and colleagues that trends in some sub- 
groups—for example, in a small number of MSM concerned with 
reporting issues—could be hidden within the larger community 
of MSM. Because there will always be individuals concerned about 
these issues, we emphasized the importance of making anony- 
mous testing available to promote knowledge of HIV status among 
at-risk people. The approval by the US Food and Drug Admin- 
istration of home sample collection tests for HIV expands the avail- 
ability of anonymous testing in all areas.3 
Woods et al also state that, except for New Jersey, we in- 
cluded only low-prevalence states. This is incorrect. Louisi- 
ana (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] rate of 33.7 
per 100 000 in 1997) and Tennessee (25.1 per 100 000) have 
high AIDS incidence, comparable with their own state of Cali- 
fornia (29.8 per 100 000)1 and are considered moderate- 
prevalence states. 
Dr Solomon and colleagues are concerned that the study de- 
sign was ecological and subject to the fallacy inherent in such 
studies, ie, that ecological correlations cannot be validly substi- 
tuted for individual correlations. However, to demonstrate the 
impact of a policy change on a large population, ecological meth- 
ods may be the most practical design. In an individual-level study, 
each individual’s awareness of the change in policy would be de- 
termined. On a population basis, this would be a difficult study 
to conduct, especially if attitudes of high-risk persons were to 
be assessed. Although our study cannot distinguish between 
people who were aware (“exposed”) and unaware (“not ex- 
posed”) of the change in reporting policy, the important fact re- 
mains that no large changes in testing behavior were observed 
in the population. Our results are supported by a recent study 
of more than 2500 people in high-risk groups (MSM, IDUs, and 
attendees of sexually transmitted disease clinics) in 9 states.4 In 
this study, more than 60% of participants were unaware of their 
state’s HIV reporting policy and, of those avoiding testing, only 
2% stated that reporting was a main factor for not being tested.4 
Furthermore, as Dr Paul and colleagues demonstrated in New 
Jersey, large numbers of people did not go to nearby states to be 
tested after HIV reporting was implemented.
