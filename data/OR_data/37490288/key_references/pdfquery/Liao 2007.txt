Objective: This study investigated the effects of a soy-based low-calorie diet on weight control, 
body composition, and blood lipid proﬁles compared with a traditional low-calorie diet. 
Methods: Thirty obese adults (mean body mass index 29 –30 kg/m2) were randomized to two 
groups. The soy-based low-calorie group consumed soy protein as the only protein source, and the 
traditional low-calorie group consumed two-thirds animal protein and the rest plant protein in a 1200 
kcal/d diet for 8 wk. A diet record was kept everyday throughout the study. Food intake was 
analyzed before and after the study. Anthropometric data were acquired every week, and biochem- 
ical data from before and after the 8-wk experiment were compared. 
Results: Body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference signiﬁcantly 
decreased in both groups (P (cid:1) 0.05). The decrease in body fat percentage in the soy group (2.2%, 
95% conﬁdence interval 1.6 –2.8) was greater than that in the traditional group (1.4%, 95% 
conﬁdence interval (cid:2)0.1 to 2.8). Serum total cholesterol concentrations, low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol concentrations, and liver function parameters decreased in the soy-based group and were 
signiﬁcantly different from measurements in the traditional group (P (cid:1) 0.05). No signiﬁcant change 
in serum triacylglycerol levels, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting 
glucose levels was found in the soy or traditional group. 
Conclusion: Soy-based low-calorie diets signiﬁcantly decreased serum total cholesterol and low- 
density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and had a greater effect on reducing body fat 
percentage than traditional low-calorie diets. Thus, soy-based diets have health beneﬁts in reducing 
weight and blood lipids. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. 



The prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide has 
dramatically increased in recent decades [1]. Compelling 
evidence has linked obesity not only to various chronic 
diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hyperten- 
sion, stroke, cholecystolithiasis, and gout, but also to can- 
cer, including colorectal and breast cancers [2,3]. In 1996, 
the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricul- 
ture Organization announced that obesity can be regarded as 
The American Soy Association provided funding for this project.

a chronic disease and emphasized the importance of main- 
taining an ideal body weight. According to results from a 
survey in Taiwan in 1998 [4], nearly 25% of adults are 
overweight. This report indicates that obesity has become a 
serious public health problem in Taiwan. Energy imbalance, 
i.e., energy intake higher than energy expenditure, is the 
main reason for people becoming overweight and obese. 
Dietary patterns are closely related to obesity [5,6]. 
Soy contains abundant nutrients and is a common com- 
ponent of the traditional Chinese diet. Soybean proteins are 
used in a variety of forms, including infant formulas, ﬂours, 
protein isolates and concentrates, and textured ﬁbers. Soy- 
containing foods include cheese, drinks, miso, tempeh, tofu, 
salami, and vegetarian meat substitutes. It has been shown 
that a soy-based diet has a weight-loss effect and can pre- 


vent obesity because soy is rich in dietary ﬁber, thereby 
increasing satiety [7], and that a soy-based meal helps to 
decrease fat mass [8]. Further, soy peptide seems to improve 
the thermic response of brown adipose tissue and thus may 
be a useful treatment option for obesity [9,10]. However, 
those ﬁndings were based on animal studies, and no clinical 
studies have examined the results of a weight-loss program 
using soy products for obese people. The effectiveness of 
soy products on weight loss is still unclear [11]. Therefore, 
this study investigated the effects of a soy-based diet on weight 
management and body composition. The results of this study 
will be applied to clinical therapies for the overweight and 
obese and to decrease morbidity associated with obesity. 


This study was carried out at Taipei Medical University. 
Flyers and leaﬂets were used to recruit 30 volunteers (6 men 
and 24 women) before the experiment’s start date. Subjects 
had to be 20 – 60 y of age, have a body mass index (BMI) 
(cid:4)26 kg/m2, and have no history of chronic disease, includ- 
ing cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and diabetes 
mellitus. Female subjects could not be pregnant or breast- 
feeding. All subjects submitted written informed consent 
before their participation. The guidelines and procedures 
were approved by the research ethics committee of Taipei 
Medical University, Taiwan. 

Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups: a tra- 
ditional group (traditional low-calorie diet) and a soy group 
(soy low-calorie diet). The soy group consumed soy protein 
as the only protein source, and we provided various soy 
foods, including drinks, miso, tofu, and vegetarian meat 
substitutes, from markets. Each subject in the soy group 
received a meal box for every lunch and dinner for 8 wk. 
Two-thirds of the protein for the traditional group was 
animal protein, and the rest was plant protein. Table 1 lists

† Two-thirds of the protein of the traditional group was from animals, 

differences in the prescribed diet content for each group. We 
also educated participants on the dietary guidelines for 
1200-kcal diets and clariﬁed the concepts of protein sources 
and food portions. A meal plan was given to subjects in the 
traditional group, but no prepared food. Both groups were 
given lectures on weight management at each visit. A diet 
record was kept everyday throughout the study. Food intake 
records were analyzed using Nutritionist Pro 1.0 (E-Kitchen 
Business Corp., Taiwan). Thirty subjects completed the study. 
Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, blood 
pressure, and body composition were weekly measured. Bio- 
chemical parameters were analyzed at the beginning and the 
end of the intervention. Side effects including gastrointes- 
tinal symptoms, effects on skin, hair, and bone, and physical 
activity were evaluated. 

The height of each subject was measured with a stadi- 
ometer. Body composition including body weight and body fat 
percentage were determined with the InBody 3.0 Body Com- 
position Analyzer (InBody 3.0, Biospace, Seoul, Korea), 
which uses an 8-point tactile electrode system that measures 
the total and segmental impedance and phase angle of al- 
ternating electric current at four different frequencies. It was 
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ac- 
curacy of this measurement to assess percentage of body fat 
was reported by many researchers [12]. Subjects took a rest 
for (cid:1)30 min before measurement. Then subjects took off 
excess clothing (coats, sweaters), shoes, and socks, stood on 
the four foot-electrodes on the instrument’s platform and 
held the two palm-and-thumb electrodes with the arms not 
touching the torso. Each subject’s height and age were 
entered, and the body composition data were calculated by 
the device’s software and immediately printed on the paper 
obtained from the manufacturer. Waist circumference was 
measured with an inelastic scale. 

Blood pressure was measured on the subject’s right arm 
with a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained personnel who 
conﬁrmed and pressed the pulse before the measurement. 

Venous blood samples were collected at the beginning and 
the end of the intervention for analysis of serum glucose, 
triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cho- 
lesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 
glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate 
transaminase. Blood samples were drawn after overnight fast- 
ing and immediately centrifuged. Blood biochemical parame- 
ters were measured at the laboratory of Taipei Medical Uni- 
versity Hospital. Serum total cholesterol, 
triacylglycerols, 
HDL-C, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate 


pyruvate transaminase were determined by enzymatic methods 
[13–15]. The LDL-C concentration was calculated using 
Friedewald’s formula [16]. The plasma glucose concentration 
was measured using the glucose oxidase method. 

All data were presented as mean (cid:5) standard deviation. 
Differences between the beginning and the end of treatment 
were tested with paired t test. We used Student’s t test to 
compare differences between the traditional group and the 
soy group. SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, 
IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. P (cid:1) 0.05 indicated 
statistical signiﬁcance. 

Thirty subjects (6 men and 24 women) completed the 
8-wk intervention study. Fifteen subjects (3 men and 12 
women) were assigned to the soy group and 15 subjects (3 
men and 12 women) consumed the traditional low-calorie 
diet. Baseline subject characteristics were similar between 
groups except age. The traditional group was older than the 
soy group but there was no signiﬁcant difference. The initial 
BMI of subjects given the soy low-calorie diet was 29.6 (cid:5) 
3.0 kg/m2, and the initial body weight was 76.2 (cid:5) 14.1 kg. 
The initial BMI of subjects given the traditional low-calorie 
diet was 30.0 (cid:5) 3.9 kg/m2, and the initial body weight was 
77.6 (cid:5) 16.9 kg. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the 
characteristics of the two groups at the beginning of the 
study (Table 2). No adverse events occurred at the end of 
the intervention. 
Both low-calorie diets signiﬁcantly reduced body weight, 
BMI, and body fat percentage (P (cid:1) 0.05) over 8 wk (Table 
2). Body fat percentage losses for subjects at 8 wk were 
2.2% of initial body weight (95% conﬁdence interval 1.6 – 
2.8) in the soy group and 1.4% (95% conﬁdence interval 
(cid:2)0.1 to 2.8%) in the traditional group. The BMI of the soy 
group decreased by an average of 0.2 kg/m2 per week, and 
the total decrease was 1.6 kg/m2 (P (cid:1) 0.05). The soy group 
and the traditional group were not signiﬁcantly different in 
waist circumference or blood pressure after 8 wk. 
After the intervention, the soy group had signiﬁcantly 
lower levels of serum total cholesterol, serum LDL-C, glu- 
tamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate 
transaminase than the traditional group (P (cid:1) 0.05). After 
the 8-wk program, the soy group had signiﬁcantly decreased 
levels of serum total cholesterol and serum LDL-C (P (cid:1) 
0.05), whereas the traditional group had signiﬁcantly de- 
creased serum total cholesterol levels (P (cid:1) 0.05). Neither 
group had any signiﬁcant change in serum HDL-C levels 
(Table 3). The HDL-C/total cholesterol ratio of the soy group 
was slightly higher than that of the traditional group after 8 wk. 
Serum triacylglycerol and fasting glucose levels had decreased 
slightly in both groups after weight reduction, but there was no 
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups. 
In the soy group, caloric and carbohydrate intakes signiﬁ- 
cantly differed between the initial and ﬁnal periods, whereas 
protein, fat, and dietary ﬁber intake did not (Table 4). These 
data indicated that subjects appeared to accept the low-calorie 
diets of the program. 

In this study, the effectiveness of weight loss in the soy 
low-calorie diet group was similar to that in the traditional 
low-calorie diet group, whereas the body fat percentage of 
the soy group signiﬁcantly decreased compared with that of 
the traditional group. Both groups showed signiﬁcant de- 
creases in body weight of an average of 0.6 kg/wk, which is 
within the suggested ideal weight loss rate of 0.5–1 kg/wk 
[17,18]. Maskarinec et al. [19] showed that having beans in 
the diet, including legumes, tofu, and soy products, was 
negatively related to BMI after adjustment for daily energy 
intake. A very low-energy diet containing soy [20] or a 
high-soy-protein diet [21] may be better at maintaining 
nitrogen balance and reducing body fat by preventing fur- 
ther increase in protein breakdown in healthy obese people.

Moreover, replacement of animal protein in the diet with 
soybean protein has been reported to reduce weight and 
improve lipid metabolism. Anderson and Hoie [22] reported 
that obese and hypercholesterolemic subjects using a com- 
mercial soy-based liquid meal replacement had signiﬁcant 
reductions in weight, although using milk meal replacement 
did not reduce weight for 12 wk, and soy-based diets led to 
greater reduction in serum cholesterol and LDL-C levels 
than milk-based diets. These investigators also considered 
that a soy diet might promote faster weight loss than a meal 
replacement and an energy-restricted ((cid:4)1500 kcal/d) diet 
over the ﬁrst 8 wk [23]. In another clinical study, 11 obese 
women were provided with a diet of 1000 kcal/d over 12 wk 
in which a soy-based or a milk-based liquid formula re- 
placed two regular meals. The soy-based diet reduced serum 
cholesterol by 20% from the initial level, whereas no effect 
was seen with the milk diet [24]. Allison et al. [8] reported 
that a soy-based meal replacement formula of 1200 kcal/d 
was effective in not only lowering body weight and fat mass 
but also reducing LDL-C in obese subjects over 12 wk, 
which agrees with our study ﬁndings. In our study, body fat 
percentage, serum cholesterol levels, LDL-C levels, and 
liver function parameters decreased more in those on a 
soy-based diet than those on a traditional low-calorie diet. 
Therefore, we suggest that soy as the major protein source 
may be beneﬁcial for weight loss. 
The capacity of soy protein to regulate weight and lipid 
metabolism might be explained by its amino acid constitu- 
tion and other ingredients. In comparison with most other 
legumes, soybean contains a high percentage of protein, 
higher absolute amounts of dispensable amino acids such as 
arginine, glycine, and alanine, and a high percentage of 
isoﬂavones including genistein and daidzein. Recent re- 
search indicates that soy protein reduces the expression of 
sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 [25], which in- 
hibits lipid accumulation and the expression of lipogenic 
genes, resulting in the reduction in body fat to the degree 
seen in subjects in this study. Aoyama et al. [26] found that 
the body fat content in obese rats fed energy-restricted diets 
with soy protein isolate, 90% protein based on dry weight 
and the most concentrated form of soy protein, and its 
hydrolysate was signiﬁcantly lower than that in those fed a 
casein diet. In hypercholesterolemic individuals, isolated 
soy protein distinctly modulates the fractional synthesis 
rates of triacylglycerol fatty acids and free cholesterol and 
reduces circulating triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels 
[27]. In addition, soy isoﬂavones stimulate sterol regulatory 
element binding protein-2, 
increasing serum cholesterol 
clearance [28], and soy-based diets with high or low isoﬂa- 
vone content affect several mechanisms to regulate lipid 
oxidation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ac- 
tivation [29]. Those studies showed that the constitution of 
soy foods is a key to the regulation of lipid metabolism, and 
thus soy consumption can improve blood lipid proﬁles. 
However, it is critical to show that single components or 
complex components of soy are associated with lipid metab- 
olism. In this study, by using many soy foods common at the 
market in Taiwan, including drinks, miso, tofu, salami, and 
vegetarian meat substitutes, we found signiﬁcant reductions in 
body fat percentage and blood lipid proﬁles. Therefore, intake 
of different soy foods might regulate lipid accumulation and 
metabolism because of their complex ingredients.

and after the intervention by using paired t test (P (cid:1) 0.05). 


In addition, promoting satiation and altering secretion of 
gut hormones are mechanisms by which soy foods are 
involved in weight loss. Lang et al. [30] compared soy, egg 
albumin, gelatin, pea protein, and wheat gluten in six 
lunches, and no effect was seen on 24-h food intake or 
satiety. However, in a comparison by Anderson and col- 
leagues [31] of a combination of sucrose and 45 g of soy 
protein with egg albumin or casein, satiety was increased 
after soy and sucrose consumption. The complex carbohy- 
drates and dietary ﬁber contained in soy take longer to pass 
through the gastrointestinal system and have low glycemic 
indexes [32], which is beneﬁcial for weight control [10]. 
McLaughlin et al. [33] proposed that trypsin inhibitors in 
soy reduce food intake and stimulate cholecystokinin re- 
lease, increasing satiety, and that is the reason for soybeans’ 
association with weight control. Other studies have shown 
that the special structures or amino acid sequences of soy 
protein act directly on rat small intestinal mucosal cells to 
stimulate cholecystokinin release [34], readily inducing sa- 
tiety. In our data we found that the soy group had a signif- 
icant reduction in calorie intake; the soy protein may have 
been more satiating. 
Soy serves as a source of good-quality protein for hu- 
mans. Consumption of soy foods is increasing because of 
the reported beneﬁts for nutrition and health [35,36]. Soy- 
based meal replacement formulae improve weight reduc- 
tion, anthropometric proﬁle, serum lipids, and blood pres- 
sure for obese adults during caloric restriction [37]. In 
addition, a high-soy-protein diet can improve glycemic con- 
trol in overweight and obese people [23]. Soy protein may 
protect the obese against obesity-linked renal disease and 
metabolic syndrome [29,38]. According to a follow-up 
study, soy protein is a suitable protein source in energy- 
restricted diets for the treatment of obesity and may lower 
some risk factors (including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
and hyperglycosemia) for chronic disease in obese people. 
In conclusion, a weight-loss diet containing high-quality 
soy products as the main source of protein reduced not only 
the body fat percentage but also serum total cholesterol and 
LDL-C concentrations, and could improve hyperlipidemia 
associated with obesity during a weight-loss program.
