ABSTRACT 
Background: Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated 
with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardio- 
vascular health. 
Objective: We compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and 
conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia, weight, 
and plasma lipids. 
Design: Free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly 
assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n ¼ 49) or a diet following 2003 
American Diabetes Association guidelines (conventional, n ¼ 50) 
for 74 wk. Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) and plasma lipids were 
assessed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74. Weight was mea- 
sured at weeks 0, 22, and 74. 
Results: Weight loss was signiﬁcant within each diet group but not 
signiﬁcantly different between groups (24.4 kg in the vegan group 
and 23.0 kg in the conventional diet group, P ¼ 0.25) and related 
signiﬁcantly to Hb A1c changes (r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.001). Hb A1c 
changes from baseline to 74 wk or last available values were 
20.34 and 20.14 for vegan and conventional diets, respectively 
(P ¼ 0.43). Hb A1c changes from baseline to last available value 
or last value before any medication adjustment were 20.40 and 0.01 
for vegan and conventional diets, respectively (P ¼ 0.03). In analyses 
before alterations in lipid-lowering medications, total cholesterol 
decreased by 20.4 and 6.8 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional 
diet groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.01); LDL cholesterol decreased by 
13.5 and 3.4 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional groups, respec- 
tively (P ¼ 0.03). 
Conclusions: Both diets were associated with sustained reductions 
in weight and plasma lipid concentrations. In an analysis controlling 
for medication changes, a low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve 
glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet 
recommendations. Whether the observed differences provide clinical 
beneﬁt for the macro- or microvascular complications of diabetes 
remains to be established. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov 
Am J Clin Nutr 2009;89(suppl):1588S–96S. 
as NCT00276939. 

Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with re- 
duced body weight, increased insulin sensitivity, and reductions 
in cardiovascular risk factors (1–3). The potential cardiovascular 
beneﬁts of vegetarian and vegan diets may be especially im- 
portant for individuals with diabetes, for whom cardiovascular 
disease is a main cause of premature mortality; the effects of 
such diets on cardiovascular risk factors appear to be similar in 
individuals with and without diabetes (3). 
Prior studies have shown that near-vegetarian diets reduce the 
need for insulin and oral medications in individuals with type 
2 diabetes (4, 5). We previously reported that in individuals with 
type 2 diabetes, a low-fat, vegan diet was associated with improved 
glycemic control, weight loss, and improved plasma lipid con- 
trol during a 22-wk study period (6). What is particularly critical 
in diabetes management is long-term improvement in clinical 
measures, particularly glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors. 
Well-planned low-fat vegan diets are nutritionally adequate (7) 
and, in research studies, have shown acceptability comparable 
with that of other therapeutic diets (8–10), suggesting they are 
suitable for long-term use. We therefore followed these study 
participants for an additional year and now report the effects of a 
low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on 2003 American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) guidelines after 74 wk of study. 


The study methods have been previously described (6). Brieﬂy, 
individuals with type 2 diabetes, deﬁned by a fasting plasma 
glucose concentration .125 mg/dL on 2 occasions or a prior 
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes treated with medications for blood 
glucose control for (cid:2)6 mo, were recruited through newspaper 
advertisements in the Washington, DC, area on 2 occasions 
(October–December 2003 and October–December 2004) to com-

plete the study from January 2004 through June 2005 and Jan- 
uary 2005 through June 2006, respectively. Exclusionary criteria 
were a glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) ,6.5% or .10.5%; use of 
insulin for .5 y; smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse; pregnancy; 
unstable medical status; and current use of a low-fat vegetarian 
diet. The protocol was approved by the George Washington Uni- 
versity Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written 
informed consent. 
Hb A1c was assayed with the use of afﬁnity chromatography 
on an Abbott IMx analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, 
IL) (11). Volunteers were ranked in order of Hb A1c concen- 
trations and randomly assigned in sequential pairs, using a random- 
number table, to a low-fat vegan diet or a diet following 2003 
ADA guidelines (12) (conventional diet group). 

The prescribed vegan diet (’10% of energy from fat, 15% 
protein, 75% carbohydrate) consisted of vegetables, fruit, grains, 
and legumes. Participants were asked to 1) avoid animal products 
(ie, meats, dairy products, eggs); 2) avoid fatty foods, such as 
added oils, fried products, avocados, nuts, and seeds; and 3) 
favor low–glycemic index foods, such as beans and green veg- 
etables. These diet changes increase dietary ﬁber and complex 
carbohydrate at the expense of total and saturated fat, choles- 
terol, and animal protein. Portion sizes, energy intake, and 
carbohydrate intake were unrestricted. 
The conventional diet (15–20% protein, ,7% saturated fat, 
60–70% carbohydrate and monounsaturated fats; cholesterol 
(cid:3)200 mg/d) was individualized, based on body weight and 
plasma lipid concentrations, following 2003 ADA guidelines 
(12). Participants in the conventional group with a body mass 
index (in kg/m2) .25 (all but 3 participants) were prescribed 
energy intake deﬁcits of 500–1000 kcal. 
Participants were free living, and no meals were provided. To 
meet the vitamin B-12 needs of the vegan group while maintaining 
the same intervention in the conventional diet group, all partic- 
ipants were provided a vitamin B-12 supplement (100 lg) to be 
taken every other day. For both groups, alcoholic beverages were 
limited to 1/d for women and 2/d for men. Participants were asked 
not to alter exercise habits during the ﬁrst 22 wk of the study, but 
they were free to alter their exercise regimens thereafter. 
Each participant met for 1 h with a registered dietitian ex- 
perienced in the use of the assigned diet to establish an appro- 
priate diet plan. Thereafter, participants attended weekly 1-h 
meetings of their assigned groups for nutrition and cooking in- 
struction conducted by a physician and a registered dietitian or 
a cooking instructor for 22 wk, followed by optional biweekly 
sessions for an additional 52 wk. Sessions for the 2 groups 
followed established curricula that were similar in duration and 
content, except for dietary details. 
At 7 points during the trial (weeks 4, 8, 13, 20, 33, 45, and 60), 
a registered dietitian made unannounced telephone calls to each 
participant to administer a 24-h diet recall, using a multipass 
approach (Food and Nutrient Database 35, released May 2004, 
software version 5.0; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University 
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) (13) and reported instances of 
poor dietary adherence to the dietitians responsible for the 
initial dietary instruction for additional dietary counseling as 
needed. 
In addition, a 3-d dietary record was completed by each par- 
ticipant at weeks 0, 11, 22, and 74 on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend 
day, using a food scale, after participants had completed a 3-d 
practice record. With the use of the NUTRITION DATA SYSTEM 
FOR RESEARCH software (13), a registered dietitian certiﬁed by 
the Nutrition Coordinating Center analyzed all 3-d dietary records 
and diet recalls. For statistical purposes, dietary adherence for the 
vegan group was deﬁned by 3 criteria: 1) the absence of meat, 
poultry, ﬁsh, dairy, or egg intake in any 24-h recalls, 3-d dietary 
records, or incidentally at any point; 2) saturated fat (cid:3)5% and total 
fat (cid:3)25% of energy on 3-d dietary records at 22 and 74 wk; and 3) 
mean daily cholesterol intake (cid:3)50 mg on 3-d dietary records at 22 
and 74 wk. Adherence for the conventional diet group was deﬁned, 
based on the 22- and 74-wk 3-d dietary records, as 1) mean daily 
energy intake (cid:3)200 kcal in excess of the prescribed intake and 2) 
saturated fat (cid:3)10% of energy. Individuals who attended ,10 of 
the ﬁrst 22 weekly sessions were also considered nonadherent on 
either diet. These adherence criteria were used for descriptive 
purposes (not for participant teaching) and were not used in the 
primary outcome analysis. 
Participants were asked to continue their preexisting medi- 
cation regimens, except when fasting plasma glucose determi- 
nations were ,80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L) or hypoglycemic symptoms 
were accompanied by a capillary glucose reading ,65 mg/dL 
(3.6 mmol/L). In such cases, medications were reduced for 
participant safety by a study endocrinologist who remained blind 
to group assignment. Dosage adjustments followed an established 
protocol, which generally called for 20% dosage reductions for 
participants treated with insulin and 50% dosage reductions for 
participants on oral agents. For those individuals for whom Hb 
A1c at 22 wk was .8%, a single medication adjustment was 
made, based on an established protocol, as follows: 1) partic- 
ipants on insulin were prescribed a 10–20% increased dose, 2) 
participants treated with oral agents could be raised to the max- 
imal recommended dosages, and 3) participants on no medi- 
cations were prescribed 2 mg/d glimepiride. Because medication 
changes confound the interpretation of the effect of diet on gly- 
cemia, analyses were designed to account for this factor to the 
extent possible, as described below. 

Laboratory measurements were made after a 12-h fast by 
technicians blind to group assignment. Hb A1c, plasma glucose, 
and plasma lipids were assayed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, 
and 74. All other measures were assessed at weeks 0, 22, and 74, 
except as noted. Plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and 
urinary albumin were measured with the use of laboratory 
methods previously described (6). 
Physical activity was assessed over 3-d periods at weeks 0, 22, 
and 74 by pedometer (Omron HJ-112; Omron Healthcare Inc, 
Bannockburn, IL) and with the Bouchard 3-Day Physical Ac- 
tivity Record (14). At weeks 1, 11, 22, and 74, body weight, 
waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure were measured 
as previously described (6). 

To have an 80% chance of detecting as signiﬁcant (at the 
2-sided 5% level) a 1.5-point between-group Hb A1c difference, 


with an assumed SD of 1.9 and a loss to follow-up of 26%, 34 
participants were required per group. An interim analysis in- 
dicated group differences of 0.8 with SD of 1.3, so a revised 
power analysis was conducted. To have an 80% chance of de- 
tecting a 0.8 difference as signiﬁcant with an SD of 1.3 and loss 
to follow-up of 33%, an additional 15 participants were required 
per group. Data for the 2 cohorts were combined, such that the 
74-wk observations were collected 74 wk after baseline deter- 
minations for all participants. 
The primary analysis of Hb A1c included all participants based 
on intention to treat. Repeated-measures analysis of variance 
was performed to see whether there were effects associated with 
time (within-person variable), diet group (between-group vari- 
able), or the interaction of time and diet group. The dependent 
variable for the repeated-measures analysis was the Hb A1c 
value at baseline and weeks 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74. 
Between-subjects t tests were calculated for Hb A1c, and all 
other dependent measures to determine whether changes asso- 
ciated with the intervention diet were greater than those asso- 
ciated with the control diet. Within each diet group, paired 
comparison t tests were calculated to test whether the change 
from baseline to 74 wk, or last available value, was signiﬁcantly 
different from zero. In cases of missing Hb A1c values, the last 
available values were brought forward. Because medication 
changes inﬂuence the dependent measures, additional analyses 
were done by carrying forward the last values before any 
medication changes for individuals whose medications for glu- 
cose or lipid control had changed, and by limiting the analysis to 
individuals with no medication changes. For body weight, ad- 
ditional analyses were conducted with the use of baseline 
weights for missing values. An a of 0.05 was used for all sta- 
tistical tests, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons. 
Regression analyses assessed whether the diet group effects 
on Hb A1c and body weight were signiﬁcant while controlling 
for baseline values, and whether the diet group effect on Hb 
A1c was signiﬁcant while controlling for baseline Hb A1c and 
changes in body weight. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients 
were calculated for the relation between HB A1c change and 
weight change. Between-group differences in diet adherence 
were analyzed with the use of the chi-square test. The software 
used was SAS for Windows, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, 
Cary, NC). 

Of 1049 individuals screened by telephone, 99 met partici- 
pation criteria and were randomly assigned to the vegan (n ¼ 49) 
or conventional diet (n ¼ 50) groups. Reasons for exclusion 
were Hb A1c values outside the required range (n ¼ 201), failure 
to meet other participation criteria (n ¼ 279), inability to attend 
scheduled meetings (n ¼ 187), failure to keep interview ap- 
pointment (n ¼ 153), reluctance to change diet (n ¼ 72), and 
other or unspeciﬁed (n ¼ 58). Demographic characteristics re- 
ﬂected those of the Washington, DC, area (Table 1). Seven 
vegan and 5 conventional diet participants failed to complete 74- 
wk laboratory assessments. Nine vegan and 7 conventional diet 
participants failed to complete 74-wk dietary records. No sig- 
niﬁcant baseline clinical or demographic differences were ob- 
served between these individuals and study completers. 

Both groups reduced energy intake (Table 2). The decreases in 
total, saturated, monounsaturated, and trans fat intake and in 
cholesterol intake, expressed in relation to energy intake, were 
signiﬁcantly greater in the vegan group. Carbohydrate and ﬁber 
intakes increased in the vegan group, with smaller changes in 
these variables in the conventional diet group. For micro- 
nutrients, compared with the conventional diet group, the vegan 
group reported greater increases in vitamin C, folate, magne- 
sium, and iron intakes and greater reductions in vitamin D, 
calcium, and zinc intakes. Increases in fruit and vegetable intake 
were greater in the vegan group. Pedometer readings and self- 
reported energy expenditure showed no signiﬁcant between- 
group differences. At 22 wk, all group-speciﬁc dietary adherence 
criteria were met by 67% (33 of 49) of participants in the vegan 
group and 44% (22 of 50) of participants in the conventional diet 
group. At 74 wk, all dietary adherence criteria were met by 51% 
(25 of 49) of participants in the vegan group and 48% (24 of 50) 
of participants in the conventional diet group. 
During the 74-wk study period, 71% (35 of 49) of participants 
in the vegan group and 58% (29 of 50) of participants in the 
conventional diet group altered their diabetes medications, either 
as prescribed by the study protocol or without investigators’ 
authorization. Net 74-wk dosages were reduced in 17 (35%) 
participants in the vegan group and 10 (20%) participants in the 
conventional diet group, were increased in 7 (14%) participants in 
the vegan group and 12 (24%) participants in the conventional 
diet group, and were unchanged or mixed (changes in opposite 
directions in (cid:2)2 medications) in the remainder. 

When data from all participants from baseline to 74 wk or last 
available value were included, both diets were associated with 
signiﬁcant sustained weight reduction (24.4 kg in the vegan group 
and 23.0 kg in the conventional diet group), with no signiﬁcant 
difference between groups (P ¼ 0.25) (Table 3). Using baseline 
values for missing values did not substantially change the out- 
come (vegan group: 23.7 kg; conventional diet group: 22.6 kg; 
between-group P ¼ 0.36). Limiting the analysis to participants 
who met dietary adherence criteria at 22 and 74 wk (21 vegan, 16 
conventional), weight loss was 6.8 kg in the vegan group and 4.9 
kg in the conventional diet group (P ¼ 0.45). 


the repeated-measures analysis of variance 
showed signiﬁcant effects for time (P , 0.0001) and for diet 
group-by-time interaction (P ¼ 0.03). The effects for time were 
both linear and curvilinear. The group-by-time interaction was 
followed with t test comparisons between groups for changes 
from baseline to 74 wk. In an intention-to-treat analysis, in- 
cluding all participants without regard to medication adjust- 
ments, Hb A1c changes from baseline to 74 wk or to the last 
available value were 20.34 for the vegan group and 20.14 for 
the conventional diet group (P ¼ 0.43) (Table 3). 
In an effort to remove the confounding effect of medication 
changes, 2 additional analyses were conducted. Hb A1c changes 
from baseline to 74 wk or to the last available value before any 
medication adjustment were 20.40 and 0.01 in vegan and 
conventional diet groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.03) (Table 4;

Figure 1). Among 74-wk completers whose medications re- 
mained unchanged throughout (14 vegan, 21 conventional), Hb 
A1c changes were 20.82 (vegan; within-group P ¼ 0.04) and 
20.21 (conventional; within-group P ¼ 0.35) (P ¼ 0.14). 
A regression model was constructed that included baseline Hb 
A1c, weight change, and diet group as predictors of Hb A1c 
change from baseline to 74 wk or last available value. In this 
model, baseline Hb A1c (P , 0.0001) and weight change (P ¼ 
0.007) were associated with Hb A1c change, but the effect of diet 
group was no longer signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.12). 
Controlling for diet group and baseline Hb A1c values, weight 
change was signiﬁcantly associated with Hb A1c change; each 
kilogram of weight loss was associated with a 0.09 decrease in 
Hb A1c. For the subgroup with no net change in diabetes med- 
ications (n ¼ 41), the Pearson’s correlation of weight change 
with Hb A1c change was r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.001. 

Reductions in total, LDL-, and non–HDL-cholesterol con- 
centrations from baseline to 74 wk (or to last available value) 
were observed for both groups, as were reductions in triglyceride 
and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations in the vegan group, with no 
between-group differences in intention-to-treat analyses (Table 
3). In analyses adjusted for medication changes, reductions in 
LDL and non-HDL cholesterol were signiﬁcantly greater in the 
vegan group (Table 4). No treatment-related serious adverse 
events were observed. 

In this 74-wk study, both diets were associated with signiﬁcant 
weight loss. In analyses including all participants without regard 
to medication changes, both diets were associated with reductions 
in Hb A1c; the mean change was slightly but not signiﬁcantly 
greater in the vegan group. In analyses controlling for medica- 
tion changes, signiﬁcantly greater reductions were seen in Hb 
A1c values and in total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in 
the vegan group. 
Much of the effect of the intervention diets on glycemia 
appears to be mediated by weight reduction. However, the 2 diets 
appear to have altered energy intake by different mechanisms.

10 Blood pressure was not determined for one participant in the vegan group because of equipment failure. 
Although overweight individuals in the conventional diet group 
were prescribed an explicit energy deﬁcit, a low-fat vegan diet 
typically elicits signiﬁcant weight loss in the absence of pre- 
scribed energy intake limits (2). This is likely because reduced 
dietary fat and increased dietary ﬁber reduce dietary energy 
density (15, 16). 
Individuals following self-selected plant-based diets typically 
have lower body weights, compared with omnivores (17). In a US 
Department of Agriculture survey of 10,014 adults, vegetarians 
low-fat diets had the 
and individuals on high-carbohydrate, 
lowest body mass indexes of the groups studied (18). In clinical 
trials, the use of plant-based diets is associated with weight re- 
duction that is partially preserved over the long term. In a study 
that used a low-fat vegan diet without added exercise in over- 
weight postmenopausal women, median weight reduction was 
4.9 kg at 1 y and 3.1 kg at 2 y, both of which were greater than 
weight changes associated with a comparison diet based on the 
National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (19). Among 
individuals with cardiac disease, a lifestyle program that included 
a low-fat vegetarian diet and mild exercise was associated with 
net weight loss of 10.9 kg at 1 y and 5.8 kg at 5 y (20). 
A vegan diet may also be associated with reductions in 
intramyocellular lipid, which is strongly associated with insulin 
sensitivity (21). A case-control study found that the median 
soleus muscle intramyocellular lipid concentration was 31% 
lower in a group of 21 vegans compared with 25 omnivores 
matched for age and body weight (P ¼ 0.01) (22). 
The long-term effect of both diet interventions on glycemia 
was reduced in comparison with the short-term ﬁndings from this 
study (6). Among participants in the vegan group with no 
changes to diabetes medications, Hb A1c had fallen 1.23 by 22 
wk (n ¼ 24) and 0.82 by 74 wk (n ¼ 14). Among medication- 
stable participants in the conventional diet group, the Hb A1c 
reduction was 0.38 at 22 wk (n ¼ 33), and 0.21 (n ¼ 21) at 74 
wk. Both groups retained most of their weight loss, suggesting 
that their diets had not returned to their baseline patterns. 
The principal diet change in the conventional diet group was 
a reduction in energy intake, which appears to be due to reduced 
portion sizes rather than to changes in macronutrient balance, 
which was close to the recommended percentages for protein, 
carbohydrate, and monounsaturated fat at baseline and changed 
only slightly during the study. This change in energy intake was 
nonetheless sufﬁcient to lead to sustained weight loss. Several 
studies that used conventional diets (23–26) have reported more 
dramatic Hb A1c reductions (0.5–1.9%) than were observed in 
the conventional diet group in our study. However, each of those

10 Blood pressure was not determined for one participant in the vegan group because of equipment failure. 
studies lasted (cid:3)6 mo, and none accounted for medication al- 
terations or dropouts in reports of Hb A1c changes. The current 
study was approximately 1 y longer than prior studies, and 
during this time changes in medications are likely to occur. We 
have therefore taken steps to report results both with and without 
accounting for medication changes. Our participant population 
had had diabetes for .8 years, on average, before study entry.

Vegetarian and vegan diets are often more effective than other 
diets for lipid control (27), an important consideration, given that 
coronary heart disease is the main cause of mortality in diabetes. 
The reduction in triglycerides associated with the vegan diet 
contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that diets high in reﬁned 
carbohydrate may transiently increase triglyceride concen- 
trations for some individuals (2, 28). It appears that high-ﬁber, 
low–glycemic index foods, such as were used in the present 
study, have a salutary effect on triglyceride concentrations (29), 
and the observed weight loss may also have contributed to tri- 
glyceride reductions. 
The acceptability of low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets has 
been shown to be similar to that of other therapeutic diets in 
studies of individuals with cardiovascular disease (8), young women 
with dysmenorrhea (9), overweight but otherwise healthy post- 
menopausal women (10), and the current study population (30). 
Although low-fat vegan diets are generally lower in fat, satu- 
rated fat, and cholesterol and higher in ﬁber and complex car- 
bohydrate, compared with omnivorous diets (31, 32), planning is 
important for micronutrient adequacy, particularly for sources of 
vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and calcium (7). 
The study’s strengths include its randomized design, extended 
duration, inclusion of individuals with long-standing diabetes, 
analysis of dependent measures without regard to variations in 
dietary adherence, statistical methods aimed at reducing the 
effect of medication changes, and applicability outside the re- 
search setting. The study also has weaknesses. The medication 
changes required for patient safety or for appropriate medical 


management present a challenge in outpatient diabetes studies of 
more than a few months’ duration. In the present study, most 
participants in both groups altered medications, often because of 
clinical success (low blood glucose values), presenting a con- 
founding variable that required special analyses. Carrying for- 
ward the last value before any medication change, as in the 
current study, may either under- or overestimate effects (33, 34). 
Limiting the analysis to those with no medication changes re- 
duces sample size and statistical power. It is reassuring that all 
statistical models (repeated-measures analysis, use of ﬁnal data 
from all participants without regard to medication use or dietary 
adherence, and use of the last value before medication change) 
led to similar conclusions, showing a mean long-term Hb A1c– 
lowering effect ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 units for the vegan group 
and from 0 to 0.1 for the conventional diet group. Moreover, the 
persistent mean weight loss conﬁrms the participants’ reports 
that dietary changes were at least partially maintained. 
In conclusion, in individuals with type 2 diabetes participating 
in a research study, both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on 
2003 ADA guidelines facilitated long-term weight reduction. In 
analyses controlling for medication changes, the vegan diet 
appeared to be more effective for control of glycemia and plasma 
lipid concentrations. Whether the observed differences provide 
clinical beneﬁt for the macro- or microvascular complications of 
diabetes remains to be established. (Other articles in this sup- 
plement to the Journal include references 35–61.)
