in the corporate setting: the GEICO study 
S Mishra1, J Xu1, U Agarwal1, J Gonzales1, S Levin1 and ND Barnard1,2 
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of a low-fat plant-based diet program on anthropometric and biochemical 
measures in a multicenter corporate setting. 
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Employees from 10 sites of a major US company with body mass index X25 kg/m2 and/or previous 
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were randomized to either follow a low-fat vegan diet, with weekly group support and work cafeteria 
options available, or make no diet changes for 18 weeks. Dietary intake, body weight, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure 
and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) were determined at baseline and 18 weeks. 
RESULTS: Mean body weight fell 2.9 kg and 0.06 kg in the intervention and control groups, respectively (Po0.001). Total and 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol fell 8.0 and 8.1 mg/dl in the intervention group and 0.01 and 0.9 mg/dl in the control 
group (Po0.01). HbA1C fell 0.6 percentage point and 0.08 percentage point in the intervention and control group, respectively 
(Po0.01). Among study completers, mean changes in body weight were (cid:2) 4.3 kg and (cid:2) 0.08 kg in the intervention and control 
groups, respectively (Po0.001). Total and LDL cholesterol fell 13.7 and 13.0 mg/dl in the intervention group and 1.3 and 1.7 mg/dl in 
the control group (Po0.001). HbA1C levels decreased 0.7 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point in the intervention and control 
group, respectively (Po0.01). 
CONCLUSIONS: An 18-week dietary intervention using a low-fat plant-based diet in a corporate setting improves body weight, 
plasma lipids, and, in individuals with diabetes, glycemic control. 
INTRODUCTION 
Approximately two-thirds of Americans are currently overweight, 
half of whom are obese.1 Obesity is associated with increased risk 
including type 2 diabetes, 
of 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension and certain cancers that 
account for about 75% of the $2 trillion spent on medical care 
each year.2 

The workplace is an ideal location for nutritional interventions. It 
is where many individuals make dietary choices, receive health 
information and spend much of their day. Employers have an 
economic interest in employee health, particularly given that 
obesity is associated with increased use of sick leave and disability 
expenditures,3 
increased 
absenteeism.4 In a 2010 study, the total cost of obesity in the 
workplace was estimated to be $73.1 billion, 41% of which could 
be attributed to reduced productivity, 18% to absenteeism and 
41% to medical expenditures.4 




A prior study of a dietary intervention involving two corporate 
sites of the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), 
a major US insurance company with about 27 000 employees 
nationally, demonstrated that a low-fat plant-based diet led to 
favorable changes in body weight, plasma lipid concentrations 
and glycemic control.5 A plant-based diet was selected because 
studies had shown that people following vegetarian and near- 
vegetarian diets have signiﬁcantly lower prevalence of obesity,6,7 
type 2 diabetes,8,9 heart disease,10 hypertension,11 cancer12 and 
gallbladder disease,13 compared with non-vegetarians. In clinical 
trials, 
low-fat plant-based diets reduce body weight and blood 
pressure, and improve plasma lipid concentrations and glycemic 
control.14,15 
We conducted the present multicenter study to evaluate the 
effects of a low-fat plant-based diet on health outcomes in a larger 
and more geographically diverse sample of GEICO employees. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Multicenter trial for weight loss and cholesterol 
S Mishra et al 

Buffalo, New York; Woodbury, New York; Dallas, Texas; Fredericksburg, 
Virginia and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Exclusion criteria included current 
alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy, history of severe mental illness, unstable 
medical status, current adherence to a low-fat, vegetarian diet, participa- 
tion in the previous GEICO two-site study and inability to attend weekly 
meetings. Worksites were then pair-matched by race and each pair of sites 
represented a cluster. The sites within each pair (cluster) were randomly 
assigned to the intervention group (ﬁve sites) or control group (ﬁve sites) 
using a random-number table. As assignment was done by site rather than 
by individual, all participants at a given site were in the same assigned 
group. The study was approved by an external institutional review board, 
and all participants provided written informed consent. 
Intervention program 
Participants at intervention sites were asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet 
consisting of whole grains, vegetables, 
legumes, and fruits, with no 
restriction on energy intake for 18 weeks. They were asked to avoid animal 
products (that is, meat, poultry, ﬁsh, dairy products and eggs) and to 
minimize added oils, with a target of o3 g of fat per serving. They were 
also encouraged to favor foods with a low glycemic index, which have been 
shown to decrease triglyceride concentrations16 and increase insulin 
sensitivity independent of effect on body weight.14,17 Intervention group 
participants were asked to take a daily supplement of vitamin B12. At 
intervention sites with cafeterias, low-fat vegan menu options were made 
available, such as oatmeal, minestrone or lentil soup, veggie burgers and 
portobello mushroom sandwiches among the daily offerings. The low-fat 
vegan menu options were highlighted in the cafeteria, but the daily vegan 
options varied depending on the individual cafeterias. A sample of the menu 
followed by the participants in the intervention group is shown in Figure 1. 
The participants at the intervention sites were asked to follow a low-fat 
vegan diet for 18 weeks. They were provided group support in a total of 
18, weekly lunch-hour classes held at the worksite for the duration of the 
study. The classes were led by a registered dietitian, physician and/or a 
cooking instructor. All instructors received training in study procedures 
and followed predetermined identical 
instruction materials (curriculum, 
handouts, videos, cooking instructions, and so on). Classes included 
nutrition education lecture videos on topics such as the effects of diet on 
weight loss, diabetes, heart disease and cancer, as well as cooking 
demonstrations and group discussion. 
Individuals at intervention sites 
were not compensated. 
Individuals at control sites made no dietary changes, were given no dietary 
guidance and no additional food was made available in those sites. They were 
given $50 gift certiﬁcates for completion of all aspects of the study. 
All participants were asked not to alter their exercise patterns during the 
study period. Participants were asked to continue their pre-existing 
medication regimens unless modiﬁed by their personal physician. No 
restrictions were placed on use of medications during the study. 
Information on current medication use was collected at baseline and 
week 18. 
Measurements 
The following measures were assessed at weeks 0 and 18: 
A 24-h diet recall was used to assess nutrient intake over two 24-h 
periods, using an online program (ASA24; Automated Self-Administered 
24-hour Recall) developed by the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, 
USA (http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/instruments/asa24/). 
The format and design of the online program were modeled on the 
interviewer-administered Automated Multiple Pass Method 24-h recall 
developed by the US Department of Agriculture. Participants with 
implausible energy intake (o800 or 44000 kcal per day among men 
and o500 and 43500 kcal per day among women) were excluded from 
nutrient data analyses. 

indoor 
clothing without shoes, using a digital scale (Befour Inc., Saukville, WI, USA; 
model number FS-0900, Health & Fitness Stand-on Scale). Height was 
measured with participants standing barefoot with their backs to a wall- 
mounted stadiometer and heels against the wall. 
Digital blood pressure monitor (Omron Healthcare, Inc., Kyoto, Japan, 
model number Omron HEM780) was used to measure blood pressure. 
Three measurements were taken at 1-min intervals. The mean of the last 
two measurements was calculated.18 
Blood samples were collected in the morning after a 12-h fast. Plasma 
cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured using an 

Abbott Spectrum analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) by 
enzymatic methods.19 High-density 
cholesterol 
concentration was measured after double precipitation with dextran and 
MgCl2.20 Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration was 
estimated using the Friedewald equation.21 In cases where triglycerides 
exceeded 400 mg/dl, LDL was measured by afﬁnity chromatography. For 
participants with diabetes, HbA1C was measured by immunoturbidimetric 
determination (Gen.2, Tina-Quant, Whole Blood Application on the Roche 
Integra 800, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). All laboratory tests were 
conducted by Quest Diagnostics (Quest Diagnostics, Madison, NJ, USA). 
At the conclusion of the intervention period, individuals in the control 
group were offered the same series of 18 total dietary instructional sessions 
as had been provided to the intervention group. Weight, blood pressure, 
cholesterol, triglycerides and HbA1C were measured before and after an 18- 
week period for this group, using the methods described above. 

Statistical analysis 
A power analysis, using the previous GEICO study showed that an effect 
size was 40.30 for 
total 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and blood pressure). With the effect size 
40.30, a of 0.05 and power of X80%, a sample of 175 subjects in each 
group was required to detect a statistical signiﬁcance between the two 
groups. Assuming a 20% drop out, 210 participants were required per 
group. If this sample could not be achieved in the initial study, a replication 
could be considered. 
Distributions of variables were examined for skewness. T-tests and 
w2 tests identiﬁed measures that were unbalanced between groups at 
baseline so as to be included as covariates in subsequent analyses. As 
exclusion of outliers did not alter results, results are presented without 
such exclusions. 
An intention-to-treat analysis was performed on dietary and clinical 
variables, where participants who did not complete 18-week assessments 
were deemed to have had no change from baseline. Participants who did 
not complete clinical baseline assessments were not accepted into the 
study. Within-group changes were determined by paired t-tests. Between- 
linear model 
group changes were determined by t-tests and general 
univariate analysis (analysis of covariance), where treatment group, gender, 
cluster and medication changes were included as ﬁxed factors and 
baseline variables as covariates. w2 tests determined whether there were 
differences between groups regarding the number of participants losing 
X5% of body weight. 
A separate analysis was performed on those participants who completed 
18-week assessments to determine the effect of the intervention on clinical 
variables among program completers. A supplemental analysis was 
conducted on those participants who did not change their medications 
during the course of the study. 


RESULTS 
Study population 
Of 
the 319 participants screened for eligibility, 291 (142 at 
intervention sites and 149 at control sites) met the participation 
criteria and were enrolled in the study. Twenty eight participants 
did not meet the participation criteria and were excluded owing 
to various reasons, as described in Figure 1. The intervention sites 
were in Tucson, Macon, Chevy Chase, Lakeland and Buffalo. The 
control sites were in San Diego, Woodbury, Fredericksburg, Dallas 
and Virginia Beach. There was no difference in the baseline 
characteristics among volunteers excluded before randomization 
and those who were enrolled (P-value ranged from 0.1 to 0.8). 
Ninety-four of 142 (66%) intervention-group participants and 
117 of 149 (79%) control-group participants completed anthro- 
pometric and laboratory assessments at 18 weeks. Eighty 
participants dropped out owing to various reasons, as described 
in Figure 2. At baseline, no signiﬁcant differences were found 
between the intervention and control groups for any demo- 
graphic or clinical measures except gender, with fewer men and 
more women in the control group (P ¼ 0.02) (Table 1). There were 
no intervention-related serious adverse events.

Dietary intake and adherence 
Diet recalls were completed at baseline by 94% of participants in 
the intervention group and 95% in the control group, and at 18 
weeks by 61% of participants in the intervention group and 73% 
in the control group. Fourteen intervention-group and eight 
control-group participants had implausible energy intake values at 
baseline and were excluded from the dietary analysis. At baseline, 
there were no signiﬁcant group differences in energy, protein or 
total 
in 
carbohydrate and ﬁber intake (Table 2). Dietary total fat and 
saturated fat intake were calculated as a gauge of adherence to 
the diet. Compared with the control group, total fat, saturated fat, 
intakes decreased signiﬁcantly in the 
protein and cholesterol 
intervention group, while ﬁber intake increased at 18 weeks. The 
difference in total and saturated fat 
intakes was signiﬁcant 
between the two groups at 18 weeks (Table 2). 


As animal products are the only signiﬁcant source of dietary 
cholesterol, cholesterol intake was used as an additional gauge of 
adherence. Cholesterol 
intake was p50 mg/day among 47% 
and 12% of participants in the intervention and the control 
group, respectively. Total fat intake was p25% of energy among 
30% and 6% of participants in the intervention and the control 
group, respectively. Saturated fat intake was p5% of energy 
among 29% and 4% of participants in the intervention and the 
control group, respectively. 
Anthropometric variables 
Including all participants in the analysis, mean body weight 
decreased 2.9 kg in the intervention group and 0.06 kg in the 
control group (Po0.001). BMI fell by 1.04 kg/m2 in the intervention

group and 0.01 kg/m2 in the control group, 
(Po0.001). The 
between-group differences remained signiﬁcant after taking into 
account gender, baseline values, cluster and medication changes 
(Po0.001; Table 3). Weight loss of X5% of body weight was more 
frequent in the intervention group (37%) compared with the 
control group (11%; Po0.001). 
Limiting the analysis to the participants who completed the 
18-week assessments, mean body weight decreased by 4.3 kg in 
the intervention group and 0.08 kg in the control group 
fell 1.5 kg/m2 in the intervention group and 
(Po0.001). BMI 
0.02 kg/m2 in the control group, Po0.001. The between-group 
differences remained signiﬁcant after adjusting for gender, cluster 
and baseline values (Po0.001; Table 4). 

Plasma lipid concentrations and blood pressure 
Including all study participants, changes in total cholesterol were 
(cid:2) 8.0 mg/dl in the intervention group and (cid:2) 0.01 mg/dl in the 
control group (Po0.01). LDL cholesterol 
in the 
intervention group and 0.9 mg/dl in the control group (Po0.01). 
HDL cholesterol decreased 1.8 mg/dl 
in the intervention group 
and increased 0.9 mg/dl in the control group (Po0.01). Triglycer- 
ides increased 9.9 mg/dl in the intervention group and decreased 
1.4 mg/dl 
in the control group (Po0.05). These differences 
remained signiﬁcant after adjusting for gender, baseline measures, 
cluster and medication changes (Po0.001 for total, LDL and HDL 
cholesterol; Po0.02 for triglycerides). There was no signiﬁcant 
difference in the changes in total:HDL cholesterol ratio among 
intervention- and control-group participants (Table 3). 
Analyses limited to those with no medication changes did not 
substantially differ from those for the full sample (data not shown). 
Among participants with baseline triglyceride values o150 mg/ 
dl, triglyceride levels increased 18.1 mg/dl 
in the intervention 
group and 6.7 mg/dl in the control group (P ¼ 0.02). There was no 
in mean triglyceride 
signiﬁcant difference in the changes 
levels among intervention- and control-group participants with 
triglycerides X150 mg/dl at baseline. 
Limiting the analysis to study completers, total cholesterol 
fell 13.7 mg/dl 
in the 
control group, (Po0.001). LDL cholesterol fell 13.0 mg/dl in the 



Multicenter trial for weight loss and cholesterol

intervention group and 1.7 mg/dl in the control group (Po0.001). 
HDL cholesterol decreased 3.3 mg/dl 
in the intervention group 
and increased 0.7 mg/dl in the control group (Po0.01). Triglycer- 
ides increased 13.9 mg/dl in the intervention group and decreased 
2.9 mg/dl 
in the control group (Po0.05). These differences 
remained signiﬁcant after adjusting for gender, baseline measures 
and cluster. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the changes in 
total:HDL cholesterol ratio among intervention- and control-group 
participants (Table 4). 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressures fell slightly in both 
groups, with no signiﬁcant between-group differences (Table 3). 
An analysis limited to medication-stable participants yielded a 
similar result. 
Hemoglobin A1c in participants with diabetes 
Including all participants with type 2 diabetes, mean HbA1C levels 
decreased 0.6 percentage point and 0.08 percentage point in the 
intervention and control group, 
(Po0.01). This 
difference remained signiﬁcant after adjusting for gender, base- 
line measures, cluster and medication changes (P ¼ 0.004, Table 3). 
Limiting the analysis to those with no medication changes did not 
substantially alter the result (data not shown). 

Limiting the analysis to participants with type 2 diabetes who 
completed 18-week 
assessments, mean HbA1C decreased 
0.7 percentage point within the intervention group and 0.1 
percentage point in the control group (Po0.01). This difference 
remained signiﬁcant after adjusting for gender, cluster and 
baseline measures (P ¼ 0.003, Table 4). 
For those members of the control group who, at the conclusion 
of the regular study period, began the optional vegan diet 
program, clinical changes at 18 weeks were as follows. 
In 
the average reduction 
(N ¼ 119), 
intention-to-treat analysis 
in body weight was 3.03 kg (Po0.001) and BMI reduced by 
1.07 kg/m2 
the total 
(Po0.001) at 18 weeks. On average, 
cholesterol was reduced by 3.03 mg/dl 
(P ¼ 0.04) and HDL 
cholesterol by 1.78 mg/dl 
(P ¼ 0.003). Limiting the analysis to 
those who completed both the baseline and 18-week assessments 
(N ¼ 94), the average reduction in body weight was 3.84 kg 
(Po0.001) and HDL cholesterol reduced by 2.11 mg/dl (P ¼ 0.03). 
DISCUSSION 
The need for nutrition intervention programs in work settings is 
driven by both medical and economic concerns. Obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease and other diet-related diseases continue to 
take a major toll worldwide. In the United States, these illnesses 
exact a ﬁnancial toll, much of which is borne by employers. An 
estimated 25–30% of medical costs incurred by employers are 
attributable to excess risk associated with speciﬁc factors, 
including overweight, heart disease, lipid disorders, diabetes and 
hypertension, among others.22 A previous two-center study 
suggested that the beneﬁts of plant-based diets seen in clinical 
settings may also be realized in the workplace. A plant-based 
dietary intervention was associated with signiﬁcant weight loss5 
and was both nutritious23 and well accepted.24 The present study 
extends those ﬁndings to a larger sample in corporate settings in 
regions throughout the United States. 
In this randomized, controlled trial, a nutrition intervention at 
the workplace yielded signiﬁcant improvements in body weight, 
plasma lipids and glycemic control among diabetics. Changes in 
these variables in the intervention group were greater than that in 
the control group, and were statistically and clinically signiﬁcant. 
Although many intervention-group participants had less than 
complete adherence to the prescribed diet, dietary changes were 
substantial, and signiﬁcant changes in anthropometric and clinical 
variables were evident. 

Multicenter trial for weight loss and cholesterol 
S Mishra et al 
The weight changes observed in the present study were similar 
to those seen with plant-based diets in observational or research 
settings.25 It is noteworthy that a plant-based diet causes weight 
loss even in the absence of caloric restriction and exercise.25 
Weight reduction appears to result from early satiety due to 
higher dietary ﬁber intake, leading to a drop in energy intake. The 
difference in weight loss could also be the result of an increase in 
the thermic effect of food, allowing a small extra edge for weight 
loss in the vegan group. A low-fat vegan diet increases insulin 
sensitivity in cells, allowing cells to metabolize glucose more 
quickly rather than storing it as body fat. As a result, vegan diets 
have been shown to increase postprandial calorie burn by about 
16%, up to 3 h after consuming a meal.26 A 2007 study showed 
that the weight loss caused by a short-term dietary intervention 
with a plant-based diet was partially maintained over 2 years of 
follow-up.27 
The reductions in mean fat intakes, saturated fat and cholesterol 
intakes in the intervention group were similar to those seen with a 
in previous studies.23,28 The reductions in 
plant-based diet 
circulating levels of total and LDL cholesterol observed with 
plant-based diets are caused by the absence of animal fat, as well 
as by the lipid-lowering effect of certain plant-based foods,29 and 
are typically greater than those seen with more moderate diets.30 
Low-fat vegetarian diets showing decreases in HDL cholesterol are 
not associated with poor cardiovascular health in observational 
studies,31,32 and have been shown to improve atherosclerotic 
lesions and cardiac events despite lowering of HDL cholesterol in 
randomized controlled trials.33,34 Among individuals with type 2 
diabetes, a plant-based diet 
improves glycemic control and 
reduces body weight and plasma lipid concentrations.15

Participants were self-selected and represent a small fraction of 
the total workforce, in part because normal-weight, non-diabetic 
individuals were excluded. However, it is not necessary to engage 
an entire employee group in health promotion activities in order 
to achieve substantial economic beneﬁts, because health risks and 
medical expenditures tend to be concentrated in a small 
population of employees.35 There was an attrition rate of 34% in 
the intervention group. However, an intention-to-treat analysis (in 
which dropouts were deemed to have had no change from 
baseline) and an analysis for study completers yielded similar 
results. Recruitment fell short of the sample size called for by the 
power analysis. Nonetheless, signiﬁcant results were achieved for 
key variables, suggesting that the power analysis may have 
provided an overestimation of sample size. Although our study 
establishes the important ﬁnding that a large corporate setting 
can indeed implement a plant-based diet intervention in widely 
locations and can achieve clinically 
diverse geographical 
important 
long-term 
sustainability is a separate issue. However, a similar intervention 
was sustained over a 2-year period in a study by the current 
investigators.26 




In summary, a simple nutrition intervention at the place of 
employment, tested in widely divergent regions of the United 
States, yielded signiﬁcant improvements in indicators associated 
risk. Further studies should explore means of 
with medical 
implementing nutritional 
interventions widely, particularly for 
individuals at greatest risk. This nutrition program can easily 
be implemented in large corporate worksites 
to conduct 
further studies exploring the effects of diet on other sources of 
disability and revenue loss such as depression, anxiety and work

productivity. These ﬁndings can be used to encourage worksites to 
offer low-fat plant-based options in their cafeterias as well as offering 
a weekly, ongoing nutrition education group, an online discussion 
board and other forms of support for staff and employees.
