ORIGINAL ARTICLE 
A dietary intervention for chronic diabetic neuropathy 
pain: a randomized controlled pilot study 

BACKGROUND: Diabetic neuropathy is a common and often debilitating condition for which available treatments are limited. 
Because a low-fat plant-based diet has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, we 
hypothesized that such a diet would reduce painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. 
METHODS: In this 20-week pilot study, individuals with type 2 diabetes and painful diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to 
two groups. The intervention group was asked to follow a low-fat, plant-based diet, with weekly classes for support in following the 
prescribed diet, and to take a vitamin B12 supplement. The control group was asked to take the same vitamin B12 supplement, but 
received no other intervention. At baseline, midpoint and 20 weeks, clinical, laboratory and questionnaire data were collected. 
Questionnaires included an analog ‘worst pain’ scale, Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, global impression scale, Short 
Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score, a weekly pain diary and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire. 
RESULTS: After 20 weeks, body weight change with the intervention was − 6.4 kg (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) − 9.4 to − 3.4, 
Po 0.001) in an effect size analysis. Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot improved by an average of 12.4 microseimens 
(95% CI 1.2–23.6, P = 0.03) with the intervention in an effect size analysis. The between-group difference in change in pain, as 
measured by the McGill pain questionnaire, was − 8.2 points (95% CI − 16.1 to − 0.3, P = 0.04). Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument questionnaire score change was − 1.6 points (95% CI − 3.0 to − 0.2, P = 0.03). 
CONCLUSIONS: Improvements were seen in some clinical and pain measures. This pilot study suggests the potential value of a 
plant-based diet intervention, including weekly support classes, for treating painful diabetic neuropathy.

Diabetic peripheral neuropathy occurs in up to 60% of individuals 
with type 2 diabetes1 and is associated with signiﬁcant morbidity, 
including gait disturbances, amputations, anxiety, depression and 
reduced quality of life.2,3 The condition manifests with damage to 
the terminal branches of peripheral nerves and usually ﬁrst affects 
small ﬁbers that are responsible for translating pain, light touch 
and temperature. As neuropathy progresses, large ﬁbers respon- 
sible for reﬂexes and muscle tone are affected, leading to balance 
and gait problems. Most patients with diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy present with pain, numbness, or abnormal, sponta- 
neous or induced sensations in the lower extremities. Pain occurs 
in 15–30% of cases.4 
Plant-based dietary interventions typically improve glycemic 
control and other 
factors associated with type 2 diabetes 
and its complications. In a study of 99 type 2 diabetes patients 
comparing a low-fat plant-based diet with a more conventional 
diet, in an analysis limited to participants making no medication 
changes, HbA1c (percent hemoglobin A1c) 
fell by 1.2 points 
in the plant-based group, compared with 0.4 points in the 
control group.5 Glycemic control appears to have a key role 
in the risk of complications.6 In intervention trials using plant- 
improvements in glycemic control,6 blood lipid 
based diets, 
concentrations7 and blood pressure8 have been consistently 
observed,6–8 and diet acceptability is similar to that of other 
therapeutic diets.9 
Two uncontrolled diet intervention studies showed promising 
results in individuals with diabetic neuropathy.10,11 We therefore 
hypothesized that a plant-based dietary intervention can reduce 
diabetic neuropathy pain and conducted a randomized, con- 
trolled, pilot study to test this hypothesis. This study was intended 
to investigate the efﬁcacy of this approach and the suitability of 
the overall method, permitting larger trials to follow. The study 
was not intended to elucidate the mechanisms by which a dietary 
intervention might lead to clinical changes or to separate which 
parts of the intervention might be responsible for any observed 
beneﬁt. 

Participants and recruitment 
Participants were recruited in the Washington, DC, area through local 
physicians and media outlets in two replications. Inclusion criteria were 
age 18–65 years, diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, and diagnosis or symptoms 
of painful diabetic neuropathy for at least 6 months. Exclusion criteria were 
vitamin B12 deﬁciency, alcohol consumption of more than two drinks 
per day, use of recreational drugs in the past 6 months, pregnancy, 
unstable medical or psychiatric illness, current adherence to a vegan diet 
and inability or unwillingness to participate in all components of the study. 
Participants were screened for B12 deﬁciency, which can cause neuropathy 
independent of diabetes, by a B12 blood level 
test and a serum 
methylmalonic acid12 test. Criteria for deﬁciency were a B12 level of 
o200 pg ml−1 or a B12 level of o400 pg ml−1 in combination with MMA 
level 4270 nmol ml−1.12

Pain diaries have been used in diabetic neuropathy clinical trials to track 
pain over time.25 Participants were asked to provide weekly ratings for 
average pain, worst pain and night pain on an 11-point numerical scale. 
Mood and depression were measured by the Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI)26 and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression revised 
scale.27 The BDI measures symptom severity, while the Center 
for 
Epidemiological Studies Depression revised scale measures symptom 
frequency. 
Statistical analysis 
Since little has been published on the effects of a plant-based diet on pain 
in diabetic neuropathy and no prior controlled studies using a plant-based 
diet were found, a power analysis could not be based on the previous 
research. Previous studies were conducted on pre-diabetes patients10 or in 
a short-term residential program with no control group.11 Therefore, we 
chose an exploratory approach that did not limit sample size and accepted 
all volunteers who met the participation criteria. 
For pain scales, body weight and lipid concentrations (total cholesterol, 
low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol 
and triglycerides), baseline descriptive statistics were calculated. For 
normally distributed data, two-tailed Student’s T-tests for independent 
samples were calculated for 20-week changes in the diet and control 
groups. Since primary outcomes were based on the 20-week study 
endpoint, statistical approaches that evaluate changes over time were not 
used. For non-normally distributed variables, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests 
were used. Chi-squared tests were used for categorical variables. An alpha 
of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. Baseline values for key outcome 
variables were included as covariates in the main assessments of the effect 
of diet in the multivariate analysis of covariance. 
For missing data in a reporting period, values from the previous period 
were brought forward. For body weight, drop-outs were considered to 
have returned to baseline weights. 

Recruitment 
Seventy-one participants were interviewed and thirty-ﬁve were 
enrolled (Figure 1). Recruitment periods were November 2012 to 
January 2013 and October 2013 to January 2014. Among 
volunteers who were excluded or withdrew, compared with 
enrolled participants, fewer (4%) were Hispanic, more (64%) were 
black and fewer (31%) were white. One control-group participant 
was excluded from the data analysis on the basis of B12

A screening interview was conducted to determine eligibility. Partici- 
pants were determined to have symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy 
if they described in the screening interview painful sensations in the hands 
or feet, including tingling, burning or freezing. The study was approved by 
Ethical and Independent Review Services. All participants signed a consent 
form. The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov under NCT01690962 and 
NCT01953757. 
Thirty-ﬁve participants were assigned to the intervention or control 
groups by study staff using an allocation sequence generated from a 
random number table. For the ﬁrst replication, allocation concealment was 
achieved using sealed envelopes. Participants in the second replication 
were stratiﬁed by Neuropathy Total Symptom Scores in blocks of two.13

instructors to group assignment. However, examinations for the Michigan 
Neuropathy Screening Instrument14 and Neuropathy Impairment Score- 
Lower Limb15 were performed by an independent blinded clinician who 
was impartial to the study hypothesis. 
Study design and procedures 
The intervention group was instructed to follow the intervention diet and 
attend weekly nutrition classes offering education and social support for 
20 weeks. The study duration was chosen to be comparable to that of 
previous studies demonstrating clinically signiﬁcant effects of plant-based 
diets on type 2 diabetes.16 The intervention diet omitted animal products, 
limited fat intake to 20–30 g day−1 and favored low-glycemic index foods. 
The diet focused on vegetables, fruits, grains and legumes. Example meals 
included oatmeal with raisins, pasta with marinara sauce, vegetable stir-fry 
with rice and lentil stew. In addition, participants were asked to take a 
provided daily tablet of 1000 mcg methylcobalamin (vitamin B12). 
The control group was asked to take the same provided vitamin B12 
supplement daily but was asked to make no major diet changes during the 
20-week study period. The B12 supplement was intended to prevent B12 
deﬁciency in intervention-group participants, should they elect to continue 
the prescribed diet long term, and also to provide a credible placebo for 
the control group.16 Assessments occurred at baseline, 10 weeks and 
20 weeks. 
Participants were asked to keep their diabetes medications constant 
when possible, but to follow the advice of their personal physicians 
regarding medication use (for example, in the case of hypoglycemia). 
Dependent variables 
Dietary changes were assessed through the use of 2-day dietary records 
analyzed by a registered dietitian. Body weight was measured in light 
clothing and without shoes using a digital scale accurate to 0.1 kg. Blood 
pressure was measured 3 times, using a digital sphygmomanometer. The 
ﬁrst measurement was disregarded, and the mean of the remaining two 
measurements was calculated. Blood glucose, HbA1c (percent hemoglobin 
A1c) and plasma lipid concentrations were measured by standard methods 
at Quest Diagnostics (Baltimore, MD, USA). 
Sensory perception was assessed by monoﬁlament sensation, vibration 
perception and ankle reﬂex as part of the Michigan Neuropathy Screening 
Instrument physical assessment (MNSI-PA, this instrument also includes a 
questionnaire ﬁlled out by the patient, as noted below), and pin-prick and 
touch pressure were assessed as part of the Neuropathy Impairment Score- 
Lower Limb.14,15 Electrochemical skin conductance was measured by a 
Sudoscan device, which evaluates each foot and each hand.17,18 
Electrochemical skin conductance is a measure of sudomotor nerve 
function, and is correlated with pain.19 
Our primary outcomes were pain and sensory symptoms as measured 
by visual analog ‘worst pain’ scale, global impression scale,20 Short Form 
McGill Pain Questionnaire,21,22 Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument 
questionnaire (MNSI-Q), Neuropathy Total Symptom Score, a weekly pain 
diary, and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.23,24 The visual analog scale 
was a 10-cm line anchored by ‘No pain’ and ‘Pain as bad as it could 
possibly be’ on either end, and participants were asked to rate their worst 
pain in the preceding 2 weeks. The visual analog scale was completed with 
an

change on a scale of 1–7 from ‘no change’ to ‘a great deal better.20

deﬁciency. The participant group had a mean age of 57 years and 
was 56% women, 47% black and 15% Hispanic; 53% of 
participants had a college degree or a higher education 
(Table 1). There were no signiﬁcant baseline differences between 
the two groups except for Neuropathy Impairment Score Lower 
Limb (NIS-LL), for which the intervention group had a higher score, 
indicating more severe neuropathy. At baseline, ﬁve intervention- 
group participants and ﬁve control-group participants were taking 
medications for diabetic neuropathy symptoms, including prega- 
balin, gabapentin, sertraline, duloxetine, bupropion and escitalo- 
pram. There were no signiﬁcant study-related adverse effects. The 
study ended as per the protocol. 
Diet adherence 
Two-day diet records conducted at midpoint and 20 weeks 
showed that 13 of 17 intervention-group participants avoided all 
animal products at the midpoint and endpoint assessments. Of 
those 13, 8 reported consuming a low-fat (25% kcal or less from 
fat) diet at both time points. An additional three of those thirteen 
reported consuming a low-fat diet at one of the two time points. 
An additional 2 of the 17 intervention-group participants were 
fully compliant with the low-fat guidelines at both assessments, 
but reported consuming at least modest amounts of animal 
products in one diet record, and two participants were non- 
compliant with the low-fat guidelines and the plant-based 
guidelines. No data on vitamin B12 supplement adherence were 
collected. 
Changes on clinical measurements 
Body weight declined by a mean of 7.0 kg over 20 weeks in the 
intervention group, as compared with 0.6 kg in the control group 
(P o 0.001, Table 2). Mean HbA1c declined in the intervention 
group by 0.8 percentage point over 20 weeks, but remained 
unchanged in the control group (P = 0.07). Despite the request 
that participants not change medications, several did have 
medication adjustments, typically due to hypoglycemia. Glucose- 
lowering medications were reduced for 10 intervention-group 
participants and increased for two by their primary physicians. In 
the control group, glucose-lowering medications were reduced for 
one participant and increased for two. 
Total cholesterol declined 12.1 mg dl−1 in the intervention 
group and 2.2 mg dl−1 in the control group (P = 0.20). Low density 
lipoprotein cholesterol declined 7.8 mg dl−1 in the intervention 
group, but increased by 0.4 mg dl−1 in the control group (P = 0.35). 
Compared with the control group, more intervention group 
participants reduced lipid-lowering medications (four vs zero) and 
fewer increased lipid-lowering medications (one vs three). 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell in both groups, without 
a signiﬁcant between-group difference. During the 20 weeks, 
blood pressure medications were changed for six intervention- 
group participants (two reduced, four increased) and one control- 
group participant (zero reduced, one increased). 


Changes in perceived pain and neuropathy symptoms 
Average foot conductance as measured by a Sudoscan device 
showed a decrease in sudomotor nerve function in the control 
group (−11.7 microseimens), but a non-signiﬁcant improvement in 
the intervention group (0.7 microseimens, P = 0.03). The decline in 
the control group was mostly due to a steep drop in measure- 
ments for two participants. A similar ﬁnding was observed in 
average hand conductance (P = 0.14). 
Pain, as measured by the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, 
declined by 9.1 points in the intervention group over 20 weeks 
and by 0.9 points in the control group (P = 0.04, Table 2). The 
largest decline was seen in the sensory subscore (Supplementary 
life improved signiﬁcantly within the 
Table S2). Quality of 
intervention group but changes between group did not reach 
statistical signiﬁcance. For the autonomic symptoms subscore 
of 
the intervention group 
improved signiﬁcantly, while the control group did not (P = 0.05, 





Diet intervention for diabetic neuropathy 
AE Bunner et al 
Supplementary Table S3). Pain as measured by the Neuropathy 
Total Symptom Score and visual analog pain scale declined in 
both groups (P = 0.70 and 0.39, respectively). The intervention 
group had signiﬁcant improvements for seven of the ten items on 
the Neuropathic Pain Scale, but 
these differences were not 
signiﬁcant between groups (Supplementary Table S4). 

For the MNSI-PA, improvements were noted for both groups, 
but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance for either group. For the 
MNSI-Q, 
the intervention group was 
for 
signiﬁcantly greater than the improvement for the control group. 
For the Neuropathy Impairment Score-Lower Limb, the interven- 
tion group improved slightly, while the control group worsened, 
but neither result was statistically signiﬁcant. 
During the study, two intervention-group participants began 
taking medications for neuropathy, and two eliminated such 
medications. In the control group, one participant began and then 
stopped taking pregabalin. Limiting the analysis of symptom- 
related outcomes to participants who did not change symptom 
management medications did not change the results, except that 
changes in total Quality of Life score were no longer signiﬁcant 
within the intervention group. 
Changes in mood 
No signiﬁcant changes were observed in the Beck Depression 
Inventory or the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression 
revised scale over the 20 weeks. 

In this 20-week diet intervention, body weight and body mass 
index decreased more in the intervention group, and HbA1c 
declined signiﬁcantly only in the intervention group. Electro- 
chemical skin conductance in the foot declined in the control 
group, but stayed essentially constant in the intervention group, 
suggesting that the intervention may have slowed or halted 
sudomotor nerve function decline. Signiﬁcant improvements in 
pain were observed in the intervention group, as measured by the 
Quality of Life questionnaire, Short Form McGill Pain Question- 
naire, MNSI-Q and change in pain question. Improvements in self- 
reported worst pain were observed in the control group, and 
improvements 
in Neuropathy Total Symptom Score were 
observed in both groups. 
Our ﬁndings, using a design including a control group with a 
vitamin B12 supplement serving as a placebo control, are 
consistent with those of previous, smaller studies showing 
improvements in neuropathy pain and symptoms with a dietary 
intervention. Crane and Sample11 enrolled 21 participants with 
type 2 diabetes and painful neuropathy in a residential lifestyle 
intervention program, using a reduced-calorie, 
low-fat, plant- 
based diet with exercise for 25 days. Complete remission of 
burning pain and an improved sense of touch was reported by 
81% of participants, while the remaining participants reported 
partial symptomatic relief. Other 
favorable changes included 
weight loss, decreased blood lipid concentrations and reduced 
need for medications for blood pressure and blood glucose 
control. That study was shorter in duration than the present study, 
including a residential 
and had a higher-intensity intervention, 
program with exercise. Since nerve damage occurs over the 
course of years, a longer study might be expected to show greater 
improvements in pain and neuropathy symptoms. 
Smith et al.10 studied 32 individuals without diabetes but 
with impaired glucose tolerance and peripheral neuropathy. 
Participants were counseled on diet and exercise during the 1- 
year study. Improvements in glucose tolerance, body weight and 
cholesterol levels were accompanied by signiﬁcant increases in 
intraepidermal nerve ﬁber density and foot sweat volume. Non- 
signiﬁcant improvements in pain were observed. The intervention

in the present study was more intense, with weekly nutrition 
education meetings, but had a shorter duration. 
The mechanism(s) by which the low-fat plant-based diet 
improves neuropathy pain may involve improved insulin sensitiv- 
leading to better glucose control.28 In addition, diabetic 
ity, 
neuropathy is associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia and 
obesity, all of which can be ameliorated with a plant-based 
diet.8,29,30 
Adherence to the plant-based aspect of the diet was high, but 
adherence the low-fat requirement of the diet was less so. A 
previous review has shown that group support and frequent 
monitoring of dietary adherence improve adherence to reduced- 
fat diets, so those factors were included in this study.30 
Medication changes in the intervention group may have 
obscured some improvements in glucose control, blood lipids 
and blood pressure. Most of the intervention-group participants 
who altered diabetes medications did so because of hypoglyce- 
mia. It is possible that some changes in pain and other symptoms 
were in part 
related to changes in symptom management 
medication that occurred during the 20 weeks. 

It is noteworthy that the control group reported signiﬁcant 
improvements in self-reported worst pain (visual analog pain) and 
symptoms as measured by the Neuropathy Total Symptom Score. 
The magnitude of 
the B12 
supplement, intended to serve as a placebo, may have had real 
effects in both groups.16 Although all participants included in the 
data analysis had acceptable B12 and MMA levels at baseline, it is 
conceivable that some participants in both groups had increased 
B12 activity as a result of the supplement. This may have caused 
some of 
the observed improvements in the control group, 
particularly since 72% of the control participants (13 of 18), were 
metformin-treated, and B12 deﬁciency is more common in that 
population.31 In addition, the control group had a higher baseline 
mean body weight and a greater proportion of black or Hispanic 
participants (15 of 18 participants, compared with 6 of 17 in the 
intervention group). Among diabetes patients, blacks have a 
higher risk of diabetic neuropathy.32 We also note that, as used in 
the present study, the visual analog pain rated only ‘worst pain’ 
during the preceding 2-week period, and did not assess typical or 
‘average’ pain. 


It used a randomized 
design, a control group, and an adequate time frame for the 
observation of clinical changes. It was conducted with community 
volunteers; 
the results are readily translatable to 
applications outside the research setting. A comparable previous 
study11 was done as part of a residential program, in which food 
was provided and exercise was mandatory. Those authors saw 
they did not 
dramatic improvements in a short 
demonstrate that 
their 
results generalizable. 



The study also has weaknesses. Because the study was designed 
to assess the efﬁcacy of the intervention on neuropathy pain and 
related signs and not to determine which part of the intervention 
was responsible for observed clinical changes, the effect of the 
weekly classes cannot be separated from the effect of the diet. In 
addition, the effects of the plant-based diet cannot be differ- 
entiated from the effects of weight loss it may cause. Further 
studies are needed to identify the speciﬁc mechanisms by which 
the intervention may lead to physical and symptomatic improve- 
ments. The self-reported nature of pain is an intrinsic limitation of 
pain research. Although B12-deﬁcient participants were excluded, 
we cannot be certain that the supplement, intended as a placebo, 
did not have real effects. Also, the deﬁnition of painful diabetic 
neuropathy as an inclusion criterion may have been insufﬁciently 
precise; future trials should ensure that diagnostic criteria adhere 
to current guidelines. 
In conclusion, this pilot study suggests the potential of a dietary 
approach for treating diabetic neuropathy and provides ﬁndings

that can be used to guide further studies. This was the ﬁrst 
randomized controlled study of diet and diabetic nerve pain, and 
demonstrates that the effect of the diet is greater than a control 
treatment for some outcomes. 
Nutrition studies are particularly important given that drugs 
used to manage blood glucose have signiﬁcant side effects, and 
drugs used for diabetic nerve pain typically offer only limited 
beneﬁt. Further studies might eliminate the confounding factor of 
vitamin B12 status by including vitamin B12 pretreatment or an 
alternative control, such as a subclinical dose of B12. A trial testing 
diet, exercise and vitamin B12 in combination might be a useful 
means of assessing the effects of a more intensive intervention in 
this otherwise intractable and debilitating chronic disease.
