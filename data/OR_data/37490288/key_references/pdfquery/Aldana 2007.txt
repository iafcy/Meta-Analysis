Purpose. This study evaluated the effect of the Dr. Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart 
Disease on cardiovascular disease as measured by the intima-media thickness of the common 
carotid artery and compared this effect to outcomes from patients participating in traditional 
cardiac rehabilitation. 
Design. Randomized clinical trial. 
Setting. SwedishAmerican Health System. 
Subjects. Ninety three patients with clinically confirmed coronary artery disease were 

Intervention. Dr. Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease. 
Measures. Ultrasound of the carotid artery and other cardiovascular risk factors were 

Analysis. Intent-to-treat analysis. 
Results. There was no significant reduction in the carotid intima-media thickness of the 
carotid artery in the Ornish group or the cardiac rehabilitation group. Ornish Program 
participants had significantly improved dietary habits (p , .001), weight (p , .001), and 
body mass index (p , .001) as compared with the rehabilitation group. The decrease in the 
number of patients with angina from baseline to 12 months was 44% in Ornish and 12% in 
cardiac rehabilitation. 
Conclusions. The Ornish Program appears to causes improvements in cardiovascular risk 
factors but does not appear to change the atherosclerotic process as it affects the carotid artery.

It is estimated that 686,040 Amer- 
icans died of cardiovascular diseases 
in 2003.1 Findings from the Nurses 
Health Study2 estimated that 82% of 
coronary events could be prevented 
through following lifestyle guidelines 


involving diet, exercise, body weight, 
and abstinence from smoking. 
Hence, lifestyle changes have the 
potential to dramatically impact the 
cardiovascular disease process and 
mortality. 
The carotid artery intima-media 
thickness measured by ultrasound im- 
aging is a valid indicator of athero- 
sclerosis. It correlates well with the 
incidence of stroke, myocardial infarc- 
tion, and other cardiovascular events.3–5 
It is also a useful predictor of the 
severity and extent of coronary artery 
disease6 and cardiovascular risk fac- 
tors.7 Intima-media thickness is influ- 
enced by a variety of cardiovascular 
risk factors,8 including cholesterol,9 
triglycerides,10 glucose tolerance,11,12 
physical activity,13–15 dietary saturated 
fat,16 body fat,17 and hypertension.18 
Consumption of certain phytochem- 
icals has also been linked with reduc- 
tions in intima-media thickness.19,20 
The links among unhealthy behaviors, 
elevated cardiovascular risk, and in- 
tima-media thickness are convincing. 
The Dr. Dean Ornish Program for 
Reversing Heart Disease21 is an aggres- 
sive, comprehensive lifestyle modifica- 
tion program with the goal of improv- 
ing cardiovascular risk factors. It 
includes a vegetarian, very low-fat diet, 
exercise, stress management, and 
group support. Previous studies of the 
Ornish Program have been able to 
demonstrate significant reductions of 
risk factors for program partici- 
pants.22,23 The Lifestyle Heart Trial 
reported that the Ornish Program 
decreased coronary artery stenosis in 
the experimental group, while coro- 
nary artery stenosis increased in the 
control group.24 This trial had a limited 
number of subjects (15 control and 20 
experimental subjects), and more than 
50% of those that began the study 
dropped out because they did not wish 
to do an additional angiogram. The 
rationale for the Ornish Program is 
that lifestyle change can impact car- 
diovascular disease in a systemic man- 
ner. All vessels of the body, including 
those of the heart, could potentially be 
impacted by a healthy lifestyle. With 
the use of a noninvasive intima-media 
thickness measure, more participants 
would be willing to tolerate the out- 
come data collection and data could be 
gathered from the carotid artery of the 
neck, rather than just coronary ar- 
teries. In addition, there are no pub- 
lished data that show that the Ornish 
Program offered at a site without the 
presence of Dr. Dean Ornish can alter 
the atherosclerotic process. 
The objective of this study was to 
evaluate the effect of the Ornish Pro- 
gram on cardiovascular disease as 
measured by the intima-media thick- 
ness of the common carotid artery and 
to compare this effect to outcomes 
from patients participating in tradi- 
tional cardiac rehabilitation. 


From August 2000 to July 2003 a total 
of 93 patients with clinically confirmed 
coronary artery disease from the met- 
ropolitan Rockford, Illinois area were 
recruited into the study. Potential 
participants were recruited through 
analysis of SwedishAmerican Hospital’s 
admission and discharge information 
sheets and community-wide marketing 
through the print and radio media. 
Participants were included if they had 
at least two of the following three 
criteria: chest pain lasting at least 
30 minutes continuously, electrocar- 
diogram changes typical of an evolving 
myocardial infarction (ST segment 
elevation or depression, evolving Q 
waves, or symmetric inversion of T 
waves), or elevated levels of cardiac 
enzymes. Patients were also accepted 
into the study if they demonstrated any 
of the following: myocardial infarction 
within the past 12 months, coronary 
artery bypass graft surgery, stent place- 
ment, rotoblator within the prior 
12 months, stable angina, or pace- 
makers associated with one or more of 
the above diagnoses. Exclusion criteria 
included history of substance abuse 
disorder without documentation of at 
least 1 year of abstinence, history of 
psychiatric disorder without documen- 
tation of at least 1 year of stability, 
impaired cognitive function such as 
dementia or delirium, participation in 
other lipid-lowering or lifestyle modi- 
fication trials, and others which were 
previously documented.24 
Prior to program assignment, all 
interested patients were oriented by 
a physician or nurse concerning the 
Ornish and traditional cardiac reha- 
bilitation programs. Following this 
brief orientation each patient com- 
pleted the informed consent form 
before participation in the study. 
Participants were randomly assigned 
to either the Ornish (n 5 49) or 
traditional cardiac rehabilitation pro- 
gram (n 5 49). The study was ap- 
proved by the institutional review 
board of the SwedishAmerican Health 
System. Participation in the study was 
free of charge to the patients, and 
patients in both groups received 
standard care as prescribed by their 
doctors. 

The Dr. Dean Ornish Program for 
Reversing Heart Disease combines di- 
et, exercise, stress management, and 
group support to lower risk of cardio- 
vascular disease. This program was 
delivered in three separate stages. 
Stage 1 included an intensive 12-week 
component in which participants met 
for two 4-hour sessions each week. This 
began once the patient was discharged 
from the hospital. The sessions in- 
cluded supervised exercise, stress 
management, a meal, lifestyle-related 
lecture, and group support. 

were evaluated and compared with 
a risk-stratification assessment model. 
This aided in determining the level of 
intervention appropriate for stage 2 by 
assessing the participants’ ability to 
adhere to the program and the severity 
of their disease. Most of the activity in 
stage 2 was self-directed, but participants 
were encouraged to attend weekly sup- 
port groups. Stage 2 consisted of one 4- 
hour session each week including stress 
management, group support, exercise, 
lecture, and a meal. The length of stage 
2 was variable depending on medical 
status and program adherence lasting 
from 3 to 9 months. Each participant’s 
progress was managed in person or by 
telephone for 1 year. 

alumni-based community of previous 
program participants, designed to con- 
tinue encouragement and support to 
reinforce lifestyle modifications learned 
in the program. Participants were en- 
couraged to attend monthly alumni 
meetings for as long as they liked. 
The program encouraged a plant- 
based diet composed of 75% of total 
calories from complex carbohydrates, 
at least 15% calories from protein, and 
less than 10% of total calories from fat. 
The diet recommended liberal con- 
sumption of fruit and vegetables, 
whole grains, and legumes; a daily 
serving of soy food; a multivitamin and 
a flax source of omega-3-fatty acids; 
and moderate sugar intake. 
Participants met with an exercise 
physiologist who prescribed an indi- 
vidualized exercise program that was 
medically appropriate according to 
a baseline exercise treadmill test. Dur- 
ing stage 1 an exercise physiologist and 
a nurse supervised participants twice 
a week for 1 hour of group exercise. 
Daily independent exercise of at least 
30 minutes was also greatly encour- 
aged. During stage 3 of the program 
participants were expected to continue 
to exercise on their own. Being phys- 
ically active for the remainder of their 
lifetime was the ultimate goal of this 
component. 
Participants met for 2 hours each 
week in stage 1 and 1 hour each week 
in stage 2 to increase relaxation, 
concentration, and awareness through 
stress management. The stress man- 
agement techniques, taught by a certi- 
fied instructor, were partially based on 
Hatha yoga. 

support meeting twice a week during 
stage 1 and once a week during stage 2. 
The sessions were led by licensed 
mental health professionals. 

The five main components of tradi- 
tional cardiac rehabilitation are medi- 
cal evaluation, prescribed exercise, 
cardiac risk factor modification, edu- 


cation, and counseling. Medical pro- 
fessionals, including a medical direc- 
tor, consulting cardiologist, and cardi- 
ac rehabilitation registered nurse 
developed individualized programs to 
help the participants return to a nor- 
mal and physically active lifestyle. 
The cardiac rehabilitation program 
at the SwedishAmerican Health System 
consisted of three phases. Phase I took 
place 5 to 14 days following the coro- 
nary event and included bed exercises 
and easy walking while the patient was 
in the hospital. Phase II was an out- 
patient program which began 3 to 
4 weeks after discharge from the hos- 
pital. The medical director and cardiac 
rehabilitation coordinator developed 
a specific exercise program for each 
participant. Participants exercised 
three times a week in a supervised 
setting with advanced cardiac life sup- 
port certified staff and electrocardio- 
gram monitoring. Individual nutrition 
consultations with a dietician were also 
included in phase II. Participants were 
given the option to attend phase III, 
which involved exercise in a community 
setting. Heart rate and blood pressure 
were monitored each session. 

The automated ultrasound method- 
ology used in this study was described 
and validated by Fritz et al.25 Longitu- 
dinal images of the common carotid 
artery were taken on both the left and 
right sides using a General Electric high- 
resolution B-mode ultrasonograph 
equipped with an 8-MHz transducer. 
Two certified technicians, trained by the 
same individual, performed the ultra- 
sounds. Technicians were blinded to 
group allocation and time measure- 
ment. Images were recorded on a super 
VHS videotape. Quality control was 
regularly monitored. 
Images from the super VHS video- 
tapes were converted to digital files. 
For both the left and right arteries, 10 
1-cm common carotid segments were 
captured from the digital video 1 cm 
proximal to the common carotid 
bifurcation. Every image was captured 
by the same technician. Intima-media 
thickness was measured at the far wall 
automatically using SonoCalc com- 
puter software (Sonosite Inc., Bothell, 
Washington), and the 10 measures 
from the right and left sides were 




combined and averaged. In some 
cases the tortuosity of the internal 
segment was unclear and the software 
was unable to automatically identify 
the intima/lumen interface. In these 
cases the internal segment from the 
near wall was evaluated. If neither the 
far nor the near wall provided a clear 
1-cm image, the measure was made 
manually using the caliper process 
described by Fritz et al.25 Intima- 
media thickness measures were taken 
at baseline, 6 months, and 
12 months. 

Baseline measures included age, 
gender, height, weight, body mass 
index (BMI), income, medical history, 
medications, blood pressure, total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol, blood glucose, blood tri- 
glycerides, C-reactive protein, homo- 
cysteine, ferritin, fibrinogen, diet 
composition, and angina. Measures at 
6 and 12 months included weight, 
BMI, medications, blood lipids, blood 
glucose, C-reactive protein, ferritin, 
fibrinogen, diet composition, pro- 
gram adherence, quality of life, and 
angina. Medications were measured 
by grouping all medications into 
major classes such as cholesterol 
medications, hypertensive medica- 
tions, heart medications, etc. Within 
each class, medication initiation or 
termination was tracked and evaluat- 
ed. Participants were compensated 
$50 at the 6- and 12-month data 
collection times. Demographic infor- 
mation, income, diet, adherence, and 
angina were self-reported. Adherence 
in this study was similar to participa- 
tion. It is expressed as the percentage 
of classes, exercise sessions, activities, 
and support group sessions each 
participant attended. Quality of self- 
reports was achieved through a mini- 
mal number of questions and having 
a technician present during survey 
completion. Venous blood samples 
were taken and analyzed at SwedishA- 
merican Hospital’s laboratory follow- 
ing a 12-hour fast to obtain hemostatic 
variables. 

Cross-tabulations were used to per- 
form bivariate analyses between select- 
ed variables, with statistic significance 
based on the x2 test for indepen- 
dence.26 Results are based on the 
intent-to-treat method in which all 
participants were retained in the anal- 
yses. When data were lost to follow-up, 
the participant’s most recent available 
data used the last test carry forward 
method. The t-test method was used 
for testing differences in means.27 
Because multiple pairwise tests were 
performed, an adjusted alpha should 
be used to minimize the overall prob- 
ability of committing a type I error. 
The modified alpha based on the 
Bonferroni correction,28 pairwise tests, 
and alpha 5 0.05 is 0.001. Statistic 
significance of change scores were 
evaluated using 95% confidence inter- 
vals. Change scores were significant 
when they did not overlap zero. Anal- 
yses were performed using SAS version 
9.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North 
Carolina). Procedure statements used 
in SAS for assessing the data were 
PROC CORR, PROC FREQ, PROC 
REG, PROC TTEST, and PROC UNI- 
VARIATE.

Participant age ranged from 40 to 
80 years (mean 5 62; SD 5 9.1). Fifty- 
three men and 40 women participated 
in the study. These 93 participants 
were randomly assigned to the Ornish 
(n 5 46) and traditional cardiac re- 
habilitation (n 5 47) groups (Fig- 
ure 1). During the first 6 months 
Ornish Program participants attended 
an average of 30.27 of the 37 possible 
program sessions (82%). Traditional 
cardiac rehabilitation participants’ 
program attendance averaged 42.6 
sessions out of a possible 63 exercise 
sessions or 68% session attendance. 
Participants were comparable at 
baseline across selected clinical vari- 
ables in all but the percentage of 
calories in complex carbohydrates, 
being higher in the Ornish group 
(Table 1). The distribution of income 
was similar between both groups: x2(4) 
5 2.77, p 5 .5976. There were no 
significant differences in medication 
use between groups at baseline. 
After 6 months the Ornish group 
showed significantly better improve- 
ment in weight, BMI, percentage of 
calories from dietary fat, and percent- 
age of calories from complex carbohy- 
drates compared with the traditional 
cardiac rehabilitation group. Signifi- 
cant improvements were observed in 
both groups for weight, BMI, and 
systolic blood pressure. After 
12 months the Ornish group contin- 
ued to show significantly better im- 
provements in percent calories from 
fat and percent calories from complex 
carbohydrates. There were no differ- 
ences in medication use between 
groups across time. After both 6 and 
12 months there were no significant 
changes in intima-media thickness in 
either group nor were there any 
between-group differences (Table 2). 
The prevalence of angina among 
patients did not significantly differ at 
entry into the study between Ornish and 
traditional cardiac rehabilitation 
groups. Eighteen of the 46 Ornish 
group participants (39%) had angina at 
baseline while 16 of the 47 traditional 
cardiac rehabilitation group partici- 
pants (33%) reported having angina at 
baseline. After 6 months the number of 
patients with angina in the Ornish 
group dropped to four, a 78% reduc- 
tion, and the number of traditional 
cardiac rehabilitation group partici- 
pants with angina at 6 months dropped 
to 11, a 22.9% decline (x2[3] 5 4.74, p 5 
.0598). This significant between-group 
difference disappeared at 12 months. At 
12 months 10 Ornish group partici- 
pants and 14 traditional cardiac reha- 
bilitation group participants reported 
having angina.

When compared with other lifestyle 
modification programs, the Dr. Dean 
Ornish Program for Reversing Heart 
Disease could be considered one of the 
most intense in terms of time commit- 
ment and dietary strictness. This com- 
prehensive program attempts to si- 
multaneously reduce an array of 
cardiovascular risk factors. The results 
reported here indicate that among 
patients with confirmed coronary ar- 
tery disease, participation in the Or- 
nish program appears to be associated 
with improved cardiovascular risk fac- 
tors but no changes in carotid intima- 
media thickness. Patients who partici- 
pated in traditional cardiac rehabilita- 
tion also experienced no changes in 
intima-media thickness. 

essentially a carefully monitored car- 
diovascular endurance exercise pro- 
gram. The primary focus of cardiac 
rehabilitation is aerobic conditioning 
and acquisition of a lifestyle that in- 
cludes regular physical activity. The 
Ornish Program also includes a moni- 
tored exercise component. When the 
impact of physical activity and cardio- 
vascular endurance on intima-media 
thickness has been evaluated in the past, 
the results have been mixed. Some have 
noted that physical activity participation 
appears to be related to a thinner in- 
tima-media thickness and a lower risk of 
future cardiovascular event14,28; howev- 
er, in a 6-year clinical trial, Rauramaa et 
al.13 demonstrated that aerobic physical 
exercise did not attenuate progression 
of atherosclerosis except in a subgroup 
of men not taking statins. A short-term 
study of middle-aged men also failed to 
support the hypothesis that aerobic 
exercise could prevent or reduce the 
age-associated increase in intima-media 
thickness in healthy men.29 The current 
findings also suggest that regular aero- 
bic exercise as offered through tradi- 
tional cardiac rehabilitation or the 
Ornish Program is unable to change 
carotid intima-media thickness. 
Comprehensive lifestyle change pro- 
grams can impact several cardiovascu- 
lar risk factors simultaneously. This is 
important because the presence of 
multiple risk factors can lead to accel- 
eration of the atherosclerotic pro- 
cess.30 Because the Ornish Program is 
a comprehensive lifestyle modification 
program, it has the capacity to improve 
glucose tolerance, cholesterol, trigly- 
cerides, body weight, and blood pres- 
sure and modify dietary intake by 
reducing saturated fats and increasing 
the number of whole foods that are 
abundant in phytochemicals. These 
risk factors and dietary modifications 
have been linked to reductions in 
carotid intima-media thickness.11–20 
Using a variety of lifestyle change 
programs, several researchers have 
demonstrated that progression of ath- 
erosclerosis as measured by intima- 
media thickness can be reduced and 
overall regression can occur.31–33 The 
Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression 
Study was a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled angiographic trial 
of lipid-lowering therapy in subjects 
with coronary artery disease.31 Partici- 
pants followed a low-fat, low-cholester- 
ol diet. Regular exercise was not part of 
the intervention. Participants reduced 
the annual rate of carotid wall intima- 
media thickness progression by 
0.13 mm/year, which was equivalent to 
the maximum rate of intima-media 
thickness progression observed in the 
Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression 
Study placebo group. A low-fat dietary 
lifestyle change was able to reduce the 
age-related progression in intima-me- 
dia thickness, but absolute regression 
was not observed. Fields et al.32 com- 
pared the effect of a conventional diet 
and exercise program and a control 
group with a group of men in a multi- 
modality intervention involving die- 
tary, exercise, herbal food supplement, 
and stress reduction approaches from 
Maharishi Vedic Medicine. After 1 year 
only the men who participated in the 
Maharishi Vedic Medicine group 
showed any signs of intima-media 
thickness regression. This lifestyle in- 
tervention was especially effective on 
participants with elevated health risks. 
Other lifestyle interventions also ap- 
pear to be effective for those who have 
never smoked15 and among postmen- 
opausal women.33 
gram is responsible for the reductions 
in intima-media thickness reported by 
others. It is also important to note that 
several trials using fluvastatin, lovastat- 
in, and pravastatin alone and in con- 
junction with lifestyle change have also 
demonstrated intima-media thickness 
regression.9,35,36 In general, these stud- 
ies showed that lifestyle interventions 
that include cholesterol-lowering med- 
ications have an even greater influence 
on intima-media thickness than life- 
style interventions alone. Almost all of 
the participants in the present study 
were on statins, which may have en- 
hanced the effect of both the cardiac 
rehabilitation and Ornish programs. 

of the Ornish Program is the rather 
aggressive dietary restrictions it en- 
courages. When compared with the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture37 rec- 
ommendation to consume 30% of 
calories from fat, the Ornish Program 
recommendation to not exceed 10% of 
energy from fat could be considered 
extreme. Such a departure from both 
normal and recommended levels of 
dietary fat consumption raises ques- 
tions about compliance and wide- 
spread adoption of the program. After 
12 months Ornish participants in this 
study were still consuming 13% of 
calories from fat, while the rehabilita- 
tion group was closer to normal 
(26.2%). Compliance to this strict 
dietary recommendation was very 
good, suggesting that for individuals 
with advanced stages of cardiovascular 
disease, the program is realistic and 
compliance is achievable. Additional 
research is needed to determine what 
level of dietary fat may be therapeutic 
and still be widely accepted by the 
public, including those who are not 
motivated by the presence of cardio- 
vascular disease. Because both groups 
were consuming relatively low 
amounts of dietary fat at baseline, it is 
possible that this limited the amount of 
intima-media thickness regression that 
could be obtained during the inter- 
vention. 


Okada et al.34 failed to correlate 
changes in total cholesterol with 
changes in intima-media thickness. 
Additional research is needed to as- 
certain if any single component of 
a comprehensive lifestyle change pro- 
that the Ornish Program may be an 
effective way to improve cardiovascular 
risk factors but does not appear to 
impact the atherosclerotic process as 
measured by carotid artery intima- 
media thickness. 


SO WHAT? Implications for 
Practitioners and Researchers 
This study suggests that the Dr. 
Dean Ornish Program for Reversing 
Heart Disease can improve nutrition 
and reduce cardiovascular disease 
risks but may not affect intima- 
media thickness of the carotid ar- 
tery. If this assertion holds true, 
practitioners should still promote 
healthy lifestyles to reduce risk. The 
effects of reduced risk on vascular 
tissue are still unclear.
