Approximately 8 million Americans have diabetes 
mellitus, the vast majority of whom have NIDDM [1]. 
Long-standing diabetes is often accompanied by severe 
and life-threatening complications, particularly cardio- 
vascular disease, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neu- 
ropathy [2–5].

stability. Each subject completed a medical history and 
physical examination, and laboratory specimens were 
collected for fasting serum glucose, hemoglobin A1C, 
serum lipids, and urinary microalbumin. 
The groups attended separate half-day orientation 
sessions explaining the general role of nutrition in dia- 
betes, the overall study structure, and the diet to which 
they were assigned. Thereafter, subjects attended 
twice-weekly support groups, stratified by treatment 
assignment, which included cooking and nutrition 
classes and a shared meal, for the remainder of the 
study. Subjects were encouraged to invite a spouse, sib- 
ling, parent, or friend to join them in their assigned 
diets and in group sessions. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to either an experi- 
mental lowfat vegan diet (seven subjects) or a control 
diet (six subjects) for a period of 12 weeks. Two control 
group subjects, both female, dropped out of the study 
due to an unrelated medical problem in one case and a 
family emergency in the other. Data from these subjects 
were not included in the analysis.

used the catered meals.

line values.

All other variables were tested using multivariate 
analysis of covariance due to the use of multiple mea- 
surements during the intervention. In these analyses, 
the baseline measure was a covariate, diet group was 
the independent variable, and the repeated measure- 
ments over the intervention were the dependent vari- 
ables. A two-tailed p of ,.05 was used as the criterion 
for statistical significance. Analyses were performed 
using SAS 6.10 for Microsoft Windows (Cary, NC, 1995). 
The study was approved by the Georgetown Univer- 


Baseline demographic data are presented in Table 1. 
None of the subjects had major microvascular diabetic 
complications. Three vegan group participants and one 
control group participant were on lipid-lowering agents. 
None had had congestive heart failure or unstable 
angina in the 3 months prior to the study or any history 
of myocardial 
liver disease, or thyroid 
abnormalities. 

Baseline diets were similar for the two groups (Table 
2). During the course of the study, fat, cholesterol, and 
protein intakes decreased substantially for the experi- 
mental group, while carbohydrate and fiber intake in- 
creased. In the control group, total fat intake remained 
unchanged, fiber intake increased, and cholesterol in- 
take decreased. Although verbal reports from all sub- 
jects during group meetings indicated good adherence 
to their diets, two experimental group subjects later 
indicated to the project coordinator several lapses in 
compliance. 
The vegan group participants exercised somewhat 
more at baseline than did those in the control group (a 
mean of 3.4 and 2.2 h per week, respectively), and these 
figures remained essentially unchanged at 12 weeks 
(3.4 and 2.0 h per week, respectively). 
In order to test the effect of diet group on body weight, 
a multivariate analysis of covariance was done with 
baseline weight as the covariate and six biweekly 
weight measures as the dependent variables. Diet ex- 
erted a significant effect on the six biweekly weight 
measures during the intervention (F(1,5) 5 20.9, 
p , .005). The experimental group lost an average of 
7.2 kg over 12 weeks, compared to a mean weight loss 
of only 3.8 kg in the control group (Table 3). 
A similar analysis of fasting serum glucose revealed 
a significant difference between groups on six biweekly 
measures (F(1,5) 5 13.97, p , .05). Because much of 
the improvement in fasting glucose occurs in the initial 
days following dietary change and because there is nor- 
mally substantial variability in fasting values, an inter- 
vention mean was created for descriptive purposes by 
averaging the six biweekly intervention values. Fasting 
serum glucose values dropped 28% from baseline to the 
intervention mean for the experimental group, com- 
pared to a 12% decrease in the control group (Table 
3). The effect of diet on glycosylated hemoglobin was 
not significant. 
While there were substantial changes in serum lipid 
values, no significant effect was found for diet group 
on total cholesterol, LDL, or triacylglycerol concentra- 
tions. However, there was an effect of diet group on 
HDL, with a greater decrease in the experimental group 
(F(1,8) 5 7.13, p , .05, Table 3). There were no changes 
in the use of lipid-lowering medications.

The interpretation of the present study is limited by

its small sample size and by the fact that participants, 
Antihypertensive medications were discontinued in all of whom were willing to accept assignment to a 
vegetarian diet, may have been more motivated than 
other persons with diabetes. Also, our randomization 
procedures produced two groups that were dissimilar in 
urinary albumin concentration. Total reported energy 
intakes for both groups were low, suggesting underre- 
porting of food consumption, which is common among 
individuals who are not extensively practiced in 3-day 
dietary records. Our study did not assess the sus- 
tainability of our dietary intervention over the longer 
term, nor did it control for the effect of socioeconomic 
status or waist-to-hip ratio. 

Despite the small sample size, the differences be- 
tween the treatment groups in the reductions of fasting 
serum glucose and body weight reached statistical sig- 
nificance. The 28% reduction in fasting serum glucose 
in the experimental group, compared to only 12% in the 
control group, occurred even though most experimental 
group subjects reduced their use of hypoglycemic medi- 
cations. The 7.2-kg weight loss experienced by the ex- 
perimental group was achieved with no attempt to limit 
energy intake. 
Differences in energy intake cannot fully account for 
differences between the two groups in weight loss, 
which may also be affected by exercise, the thermic 
effect of food, and resting metabolic rate (which may 
be influenced by a vegetarian diet) [26]. 


The reduction in HDL which occurred in the experi- 
mental group is a common finding with lowfat and vege- 
tarian diets and appears not to be associated with ele- 
vated atherosclerotic risk in the context of a low total 
serum cholesterol concentration [23,27,28]. 
Mean 24-h urinary protein losses decreased in the 
experimental group, in contrast to an increase in the 
control group, although the difference did not achieve 
statistical significance. This finding, along with the re- 
ductions in glycosylated hemoglobin and medication 
use in the experimental group, awaits examination with 
a larger sample. 
In summary, we found that use of a lowfat vegan diet 
was associated with reductions in fasting serum glucose 
concentrations and body weight in a 12-week trial, de- 
spite decreased medication use in the experimental 
group and the small sample recruited for this trial. 
These benefits await confirmation by further studies.
