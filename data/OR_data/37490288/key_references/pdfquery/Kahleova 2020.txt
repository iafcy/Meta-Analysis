Obesity is uncommon in individuals whose diets are based on plant-derived foods.1,2 In clinical 
trials, such diets caused weight loss, for which 2 explanations have been offered.3 First, a high-fiber, 
low-fat diet has a low energy density, which reduces energy intake. Second, a low-fat, vegan diet 
increases the thermic effect of food, which accounts for approximately 10% of total energy 
expenditure.4 However, in the latter randomized clinical trial, the control group was following an 
active diet based on National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines.5 Because there was no 
untreated control group, the effect of a low-fat vegan diet on thermogenesis remains unclear. 


intramyocellular or hepatocellular lipid levels, a plant-based diet may lead to increased mitochondrial 
activity and postprandial metabolism.6,7 This is particularly important because the accumulation of 
lipids in muscle and liver cells may also be associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.8-10 
The aim of this study was to measure the effects of a low-fat vegan diet on body weight, insulin 



Study Design and Eligibility 
This randomized clinical trial using a single-center, open parallel design was conducted between 







Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written informed consent. This study followed the 
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.11 






Randomization and Study Groups 
With use of a computer-generated system, participants were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to an 






fat) consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, and fruits without animal products or added fats. 
Vitamin B12 was supplemented (500 μg/d). The intervention group attended weekly classes for 
detailed instruction and cooking demonstrations and received printed materials and small food 




Outcomes 
All measurements were performed at baseline and 16 weeks. The outcome assessors (K.F.P., G.I.S., 




analyzed by staff members certified in the Nutrition Data System for Research, version 2016, 
developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.12 In addition, 
study dietitians made unannounced telephone calls to assess participants’ dietary adherence. All 

medication regimens for the duration of the study. Physical activity was assessed by the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire.13 


visceral fat volume were assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA; GE Healthcare), 
which has been validated against computed tomography14 and magnetic resonance imaging.15 The 
measurement of total body fat and visceral fat had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 1.0% and 5.4%, 
respectively.16,17 












low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 3.0%; and triglycerides 3.2%). All test kits were made by Roche. 
Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment index.18 The 
predicted insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM) provided a validated measure of dynamic insulin 
sensitivity.19 Resting energy expenditure and postprandial metabolism were measured by indirect 
calorimetry (Cosmed Quark CPET) using a ventilated hood system (accuracy of measurement with a 






CV<1% and repeatability of measurement with a CV of 1.2%).20,21 Each measurement was performed 
for 15 minutes after an overnight fast and 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the standard breakfast. 


School of Medicine. Hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids were quantified by proton magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy at 4T (Bruker).22 This method has been shown to provide a precise 
quantification of fat fractions, with a mean bias of −1.1.% to 0.5%.23 Hepatocellular lipid content was 
measured by 1H respiratory-gated stimulated echo acquisition mode spectroscopy in a 
15 × 15 × 15-mm3 voxel. Acquisition was synchronized to the respiratory cycle and triggered at the 
end of expiration. A water-suppressed lipid spectrum and a lipid-suppressed water spectrum were 

averaged and calculated. In addition, hepatocellular lipid content was corrected for transverse 
relaxation using the transverse relaxation times of 22 ms for water and 44 ms for lipid.24 
Intramyocellular lipid content was measured in the soleus muscle using an 8.5-cm diameter circular 
13C surface coil with twin, orthogonal circular 13-cm 1H quadrature coils. Scout images of the lower leg 
were obtained to ensure correct positioning of the participant and to define an adequate volume for 
localized shimming using the FastMap procedure.25 
Power Analysis 
Sample size was based on the change in body weight, insulin resistance, and postprandial 
metabolism previously observed with a plant-based diet,4 with an α level of 0.05. The assumed 
change for body weight was a mean (SD) of 5.8 (3.2) kg in the intervention arm and 1 (3.2) kg in the 











For the substudy assessing the role of intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipids in insulin 
sensitivity, a study26 from 2012 provided a basis for a power analysis. In that study, 7 lean individuals 
with insulin resistance followed a hypocaloric (1200 kcal/d) diet for 9 weeks. The mean (SD)

intake but nonetheless led to 34% and 10% reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid 
levels, respectively. The reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels correlated with
