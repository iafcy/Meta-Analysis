Turning the Waiting Room into a Classroom: 
Weekly Classes Using a Vegan or a Portion- 
Controlled Eating Plan Improve Diabetes 
Control in a Randomized Translational Study 

ABSTRACT 
Background In research settings, plant-based (vegan) eating plans improve diabetes 
management, typically reducing weight, glycemia, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol concentrations to a greater extent than has been shown with portion- 
controlled eating plans. 
Objective The study aimed to test whether similar beneﬁts could be found using weekly 
nutrition classes in a typical endocrinology practice, hypothesizing that a vegan eating 
plan would improve glycemic control, weight, lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and 
renal function and would do so more effectively than a portion-controlled eating plan. 
Design In a 20-week trial, participants were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan or 
portion-controlled eating plan. 
Participants/setting Individuals with type 2 diabetes treated in a single endocrinology 
practice in Washington, DC, participated (45 starters, 40 completers). 
Intervention Participants attended weekly after-hours classes in the ofﬁce waiting room. 
The vegan plan excluded animal products and added oils and favored low-glycemic index 
foods. The portion-controlled plan included energy intake limits for weight loss (typically 
a deﬁcit of 500 calories/day) and provided guidance on portion sizes. 
Main outcome measures Body weight, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), plasma lipids, uri- 
nary albumin, and blood pressure were measured. 
Statistical analyses performed For normally distributed data, t tests were used; for 
skewed outcomes, rank-based approaches were implemented (Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test for within-group changes, Wilcoxon two-sample test for between-group compar- 
isons, and exact Hodges-Lehmann estimation to estimate effect sizes). 
Results Although participants were in generally good metabolic control at baseline, 
body weight, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol improved signiﬁcantly within each group, 
with no signiﬁcant differences between the two eating plans (weight: (cid:1)6.3 kg vegan, 
(cid:1)4.4 kg portion-controlled, between-group P¼0.10; HbA1c, (cid:1)0.40 percentage point in 
both groups, P¼0.68; LDL cholesterol (cid:1)11.9 mg/dL vegan, (cid:1)12.7 mg/dL portion- 
controlled, P¼0.89). Mean urinary albumin was normal at baseline and did not mean- 
ingfully change. Blood pressure changes were not signiﬁcant. 
Conclusions Weekly classes, integrated into a clinical practice and using either a low- 
fat vegan or portion-controlled eating plan, led to clinical improvements in individuals 
with type 2 diabetes.

This clinical trial ascertained the effects of a simple, on-site 
program of nutrition instruction for individuals with type 2 
diabetes, using weekly classes in the ofﬁce waiting room of a 
private endocrinology practice in Washington, DC. It used, in 
randomized fashion, low-fat vegan and portion-controlled 
eating plans, testing the hypotheses that a vegan interven- 
tion would (1) improve glycemic control, body weight, 
plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and indices of 
renal function in a within-group analysis during a 20-week 
intervention, and (2) do so more effectively than an inter- 
vention using a portion-controlled eating plan. 
METHODS 
The study was a 20-week nutrition intervention using a 
weekly on-site class structure in an established endocri- 
nology practice. There was no untreated group. The protocol 
was approved by Ethical & Independent Review Services, 
Independence, MO, a private institutional review board. All 
participants gave written informed consent. The study was 
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, identiﬁer NCT01222429. 
RECRUITMENT 
Individuals being treated for type 2 diabetes in a Washington, 
DC, private endocrinology practice were notiﬁed by mail or 
waiting-room ﬂiers about 
the study. Volunteers were 
screened by telephone, and those appearing to meet partic- 
ipation criteria were interviewed in person and invited to 
complete a practice 3-day dietary record. 
Inclusion criteria were (1) a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, as deﬁned by a fasting plasma glucose concentration 
(cid:3)126 mg/dL on two occasions or a prior physician’s diagnosis 
of type 2 diabetes with the use of hypoglycemic medications 
for at least 6 months; (2) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) between 
6.5% and 10.5%; (3) age at least 18 years; (4) ability and 
willingness to be assigned to either a low-fat, vegan, or 
portion-controlled eating plan and participate in all compo- 
nents of the study; and (5) diabetes medications unchanged 
for 1 month before volunteering for the study. 
Exclusion criteria were (1) body mass index >45 (calcu- 
lated as kg/m2); (2) alcohol consumption of more than two 
drinks per day or the equivalent, episodic increased drinking 
(eg, more than two drinks per day on weekends), or a history 
of alcohol abuse or dependency followed by any current use; 
(3) use of recreational drugs in the past 6 months; (4) preg- 
nancy; (5) signs or symptoms of acute uncontrolled diabetes, 
including but not limited to polyuria, polydipsia, blurred 
vision, or uncontrolled weight loss; (6) unstable medical 
status; (7) already following a low-fat, vegetarian eating 
pattern; and (8) lack of English ﬂuency. 
The study was completed in two replications beginning in 
2011 and 2014, respectively, to maximize recruitment. In each 
replication, HbA1c concentrations were obtained, and par- 
ticipants were then ranked in order of HbA1c levels. Using a 
computer-generated random-number 
they were 
randomly assigned in sequential pairs to vegan and portion- 
controlled groups. Because assignment was done simulta- 
neously, allocation concealment was unnecessary. 

Each participant in both groups met with a registered die- 
titian nutritionist (RDN) to develop an individualized eating 
plan. These meetings followed a set agenda, which was 
identical for all participants within each group. Thereafter, 
participants in both groups were asked to follow their assigned 
eating plans and attend weekly 1-hour meetings held after 
hours in the ofﬁce waiting room for instruction and support. 
Before each meeting, all participants were weighed privately 
and were made aware of their body weights. The waiting room 
chairs were set in a circle that could accommodate approxi- 
mately 15 participants. The timing and curricula for the two 
groups were identical, except for the eating plan guidelines. All 
sessions were conducted by an RDN, nurse, physician, cooking 
instructor, or research staff and included information on dia- 
betes, nutrition, meal planning, shopping, food preparation 
techniques, recipes, and discussion of everyday dietary chal- 
lenges, such as dining out and healthful snacking. 

low- 
glycemic index, vegan eating plan. According to the Academy 
of Nutrition and Dietetics, vegan eating patterns meet all 
nutritional requirements when appropriately planned and 
accompanied by supplemental vitamin B-12.4 The eating plan 
consisted of whole grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruits. 
Animal products and added oils were excluded; no re- 
strictions were placed on energy or carbohydrate intake. In 
choosing carbohydrate-containing foods, participants were 
encouraged to select those retaining their natural ﬁber and 
having a glycemic index <70, using tables standardized to a 
value of 100 for glucose. No meals were provided. 
The eating plan was expected to derive approximately 10% 
of energy from fat, 10% to 15% of energy from protein, and the 
remainder from carbohydrates, and to provide approximately 
30 to 40 g ﬁber per day. 
The portion-controlled group participants received eating 
plans following accepted principles for individualized medi- 
cal nutrition therapy, including energy limits when needed 
for weight loss (typically a deﬁcit of 500 calories/day) and 
guidance on portion sizes, distributing carbohydrates 
throughout the day, reducing saturated fats, favoring high- 
ﬁber foods, and limiting sodium. 

in both groups were provided with a 
commercially available vitamin B-12 (100 mg) supplement 
and asked to take it every other day. For both groups, alco- 
holic beverages were limited to one per day for women and 
two per day for men. 




Research Question: Can the beneﬁts of dietary interventions 
for people with type 2 diabetes found in the research setting 
translate into similar beneﬁts in a typical diabetes clinic, and, 
if so, does a vegan eating plan lead to greater improvements 
than a portion-controlled eating plan? 
Key Findings: A 20-week randomized clinical trial testing the 
beneﬁts of vegan and portion-controlled eating plans, 
provided through weekly classes, showed that both plans 
signiﬁcantly improved body weight ((cid:1)6.3 kg vegan, (cid:1)4.4 kg 
portion-controlled), glycemic control (HbA1c (cid:1)0.40 
percentage point in both groups), and lipid concentrations 
(LDL cholesterol (cid:1)11.9 mg/dL vegan, (cid:1)12.7 mg/dL portion- 
controlled), with no signiﬁcant differences between the two 
eating plans. 
The study did not seek to separate the effects of nutritional 
changes from those of group support; nor did it aim to 
construct isocaloric interventions, which is not feasible in 
free-living participants preparing their own meals, nor 
desirable given that the portion-controlled eating plan used 
energy restriction as a key weight-loss strategy and the vegan 
plan permitted unlimited energy intake. 
At weeks 3 and 15, an RDN made unannounced telephone 
calls to each participant to administer a 24-hour food recall, 
using a multi-pass approach (Nutrition Coordinating Center, 
University of Minnesota). These recalls were not subjected to 
statistical analysis but allowed the investigators to check for 
poor adherence. 

All participants were asked not to alter their exercise pat- 
terns and not to change their use of medications or nutri- 
tional 
recommended by their 
personal physicians. All participants were under the care of a 
single endocrinologist, who did not participate in the study 
intervention or assessment and who was asked to avoid 
changing medications during the study to the extent possible, 
except in cases of medical necessity (eg, hypoglycemia or 
hypotension). Many participants also had primary care phy- 
sicians who were notiﬁed of their patients’ participation and 
were also asked not to change medication regimens except as 
clinically required. 
NUTRITIONAL AND CLINICAL MEASURES 
At baseline, height was measured without shoes and with the 
participant’s back to a wall-mounted measuring tape, and 
heels against the wall, and recorded to the nearest 0.5 cm. 
Because dopamine activity plays a role in appetitive 
behavior and because certain D2 dopamine receptor Taq 1A 
genotypes (A1A1, A1A2) have been associated with obesity,5 
these genotypes were ascertained on all participants by us- 
ing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method6 to assess 
whether the genotypes were similarly distributed between 
the two intervention groups. 
At baseline and 20 weeks, participants were asked to 
report changes in their health and medication use, and the 
following determinations were made. For physiological and 
laboratory measures, the determinations were made by 
technicians blind to group assignment after subjects had 
completed a 12-hour fast. 
Dietary intake was assessed with a 3-day food record. 
Participants were given instructions on estimating portion 
sizes using food models, along with a sample record. Dietary 
intake data were collected and analyzed by using Nutrition 
Data System for Research (NDSR) software versions 20107 
and 20148 by an RDN certiﬁed by the Nutrition Coordi- 
nating Center, University of Minnesota. 

indoor clothing, 
without shoes, to the nearest 0.1 kg, using a digital scale 
(model FS0900, Befour, Inc). 
Blood pressure was measured using a digital blood pres- 
sure monitor and a cuff of a size appropriate to the partici- 
pant’s arm, at the level of the heart, after participants had 
rested in a seated position for 5 minutes without talking or 
reading. Three measurements were taken at 1-minute in- 
tervals. The ﬁrst was disregarded, and the mean of the 
remaining two measurements was calculated. 

HbA1c, plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol and triglyceride 
concentrations, and urinary albumin concentrations were 
measured, using standard methods, at Quest Diagnostics, 
Secaucus, NJ. 
Medication changes for each participant were assessed 
based on self-report, buttressed by chart reviews in cases 
involving any question of the accuracy of self-report, and 
were classiﬁed as a net increase, net decrease, mixed changes 
(changes in opposing directions for two or more medica- 
tions), or no change. 
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 
The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short 
form assessed recent physical activity patterns. The method is 
highly reliable; an assessment of testeretest repeatability 
produced a correlation of 0.8.9 
STATISTICAL PROCEDURES 
A power analysis was done to determine sample sizes, based 
on HbA1c changes observed in prior studies. An alpha of .05 
was used to test for group differences. The sample size 
needed to demonstrate a signiﬁcant difference with power of 
0.80 for effect size of 0.64 was estimated at 32 per group. 
Expecting up to 20% attrition, we aimed to recruit 40 par- 
ticipants in each group, for a total of 80. 
Descriptive statistics for demographic and clinical variables 
were calculated for each group. Categorical baseline factors 
were compared between treatment groups by using the c2 
test or Fisher’s exact test in the case of small cell counts. 
Distributions of changes in clinical outcomes from baseline to 
20 weeks were assessed for approximate normality. For 
outcomes whose change distributions were sufﬁciently close 
to normality, one-sample and two-sample t tests were used 
to assess the signiﬁcance of within-group changes and to 
compare magnitudes of between-group changes, respec- 
tively. For outcomes with excessively skewed change distri- 
butions (HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, urinary albumin, and 
IPAQ), rank-based approaches were implemented, including 
the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to assess the signiﬁcance of 
within-group changes, and the Wilcoxon two-sample test to 
compare changes between the groups; exact Hodges- 
Lehmann estimation was used to provide an estimate of ef- 
fect size for these outcomes. A two-sided alpha of .05 was 
used for all statistical tests. Reported P values are not 
adjusted for multiple comparisons. 
RESULTS 
Seventy-six patients inquired about the study. Of these, 27 
were excluded for the following reasons: HbA1c outside the 
acceptable range (n¼7), unable to attend weekly meetings 
(n¼3), no longer a patient in the practice (n¼2), unwilling to 
alter food habits (n¼1), failed to attend in-person interview 
(n¼5), withdrew before acceptance (n¼6), and lost to follow- 
up during the evaluation process (n¼3). An additional four 
volunteers failed to attend the baseline assessment. As a 
result, 45 volunteers (29 in 2011 and 16 in 2014) were 
accepted into the study and randomly assigned to the vegan 
group (n¼21) or the portion-controlled group (n¼24). De- 
mographic data are described in Table 1. No signiﬁcant dif- 
ferences were found between groups. The A1 allele was

found in 44% of participants, without a signiﬁcant difference 
in distribution between the two groups. 
Two vegan group participants and three portion-controlled 
group participants failed to complete 20 weeks of study (one 
moved, one withdrew, and three were lost to follow-up). 
Therefore, 19 vegan group and 21 portion-controlled group 
participants completed the study. Food records were 
completed at baseline and 20 weeks by 19 participants in 
each group. 
Food Intake and Physical Activity 
Both groups made substantial changes in eating patterns 
(Table 2). According to the food records, both groups reduced 
their energy intake. The vegan group increased its carbohy- 
drate intake (þ54 g/d), and the portion-controlled group 
reduced its intake of carbohydrate ((cid:1)14 g/d, between-group 
P¼0.0024). However, as percentages of energy, carbohy- 
drate intake rose in both groups (vegan, 49% to 71% of energy; 
portion-controlled, 43% to 50% of energy, P¼0.0013). The 
percentage of energy from fat decreased in both groups 
(vegan, 33% to 18%; portion-controlled, 39% to 30%, 
P¼0.0476). The reductions in saturated fat and cholesterol 
were greater in the vegan group (P¼0.0341 and P¼0.0012, 
respectively). The percentage of energy from protein 
decreased in the vegan group (18% to 14%) but increased in 
the portion-controlled group (19% to 21%; P¼0.0004). Iron 
intake increased slightly in the vegan group and decreased 
slightly in the portion-controlled group; the between-group 
difference did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. 
Although participants were asked not to alter their physical 
activity levels, both groups increased their reported physical 
activity (Table 3). This was especially true for the portion- 
controlled group. However, variability was large, and the 
difference between groups for the change in activity was not 
statistically signiﬁcant. 
Clinical Changes 
Body weight fell by 6.3 kg in the vegan group and 4.4 kg in 
the portion-controlled group (P¼0.10, Table 3). Body mass 
index decreased by 2.3 points and 1.5 points in the vegan and 
portion-controlled groups, respectively (P¼ 0.075). 
In the vegan group, medications for glycemic control were 
reduced in four participants and mixed (medication changes 
in opposite directions) in two, and medication use could not 
be accurately assessed in two more. In the portion-controlled 
group, medications were increased in three participants, 
decreased in six, and mixed in four. This left 11 and eight 
study completers with unchanged medication regimens for 
glycemic control in the vegan and portion-controlled groups, 
respectively. HbA1c values were highly skewed; median 
HbA1c values fell 0.40 percentage points in both groups 
(P¼0.68). Median fasting glucose values decreased by 16.0 
mg/dL in the vegan group and 12.5 mg/dL in the portion- 
controlled group (P¼0.71). 
Total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol con- 
centrations were low at baseline in both groups, reﬂecting 
the use of lipid-lowering medications by most participants at 
baseline. Several participants also altered their lipid-lowering 
medications during the study, despite the request that they 
not do so, leaving 14 vegan group and 16 portion-controlled 
group study completers who did not report changes in 
these medications. The laboratory failed to report an LDL 
cholesterol value for one vegan group participant. LDL 
cholesterol values fell signiﬁcantly in both groups, with no 
signiﬁcant difference between groups (vegan, (cid:1)11.9; portion- 
controlled, (cid:1)12.7; P¼0.89). Triglyceride concentrations 
increased (but not signiﬁcantly) in the vegan group and 
decreased signiﬁcantly in the portion-controlled group; the 
difference between groups did not reach statistical signiﬁ- 
cance (P¼0.06). 
Tests of renal function were, on average, in the normal 
range at baseline and showed no consequential changes 
during the study. Other changes in clinical variables are re- 
ported in Table 3. 
DISCUSSION 
In this study of patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes, 
a simple intervention of group instruction and support for 
changes in eating patterns led to signiﬁcant additional im- 
provements in key clinical measures. Both eating plans led to

improvements in body weight, HbA1c, and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations that were signiﬁcant within each group, with 
no signiﬁcant differences in effectiveness between the two 
regimens in this small trial. Mean HbA1c values were below 
7.0% in both groups at baseline and fell an additional 0.4 
percentage point in each group. Mean LDL cholesterol values 
were well below 100 mg/dL at baseline, and the dietary in- 
terventions improved control further. The modest increase in 
triglycerides observed in the vegan group accords with pre- 
vious studies that have observed that, compared with in- 
those following 
dividuals 
vegetarian or vegan diets have slightly lower triglyceride 
concentrations in observational studies but slightly higher 
triglyceride concentrations in clinical trials,10 typically to a 
degree that is not signiﬁcant statistically or clinically.11 

Previous studies have shown that group-based diabetes 
self-management education reduces body weight, glycemia, 
blood pressure, and medication requirements.12 In a 4-year 
trial, a group education program proved more effective in 
preventing deterioration of metabolic control in individuals 
with type 2 diabetes, compared with individual consulta- 
tions.13 An advantage of dietary interventions, compared 
with pharmacologic treatments, 
they typically 
improve several endpoints concurrently. This has been 
particularly demonstrated with vegan regimens, which 
improve body weight as well as or better than calorie- 
restricted regimens when prescribed without explicit limits 
on energy intake,4 presumably because of their low energy 
density. Because they contain no animal fat or cholesterol and 
are typically rich in dietary ﬁber, vegan diets improve lipid 
control.10 In the current study, both groups already had good 


lipid control at baseline, limiting the study’s ability to make 
between-group comparisons of lipid-lowering effects. Low- 
fat vegan eating patterns also improve glycemic control14 
and blood pressure,15 reverse coronary atherosclerosis,16 
and greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.11 
Nonetheless, both programs tested in this intervention 
study yielded signiﬁcant clinical beneﬁts. 
Although both vegan and portion-controlled eating plans 
have been shown to be effective at improving glycemic 
control and cardiovascular risk,17 they affect blood glucose via 
somewhat different presumed mechanisms. Both cause 
weight loss, which should help glycemic control, but by 
reducing carbohydrate intake, the portion-controlled plan 
reduces blood sugar directly, without necessarily addressing 
insulin resistance.2 The low-fat vegan plan greatly reduces fat 
intake while increasing carbohydrate intake, apparently 
reducing intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipid, which is 
at the root of insulin resistance.3 
The strikingly high (44%) prevalence of the DRD2 Taq1 A1 
allele is similar to that reported in a previous study of in- 
dividuals with type 2 diabetes and is clinically important 
because of the presumed link between this allele and alco- 
holism, drug abuse, compulsive gambling, and obesity, sug- 
gesting that the allele is associated with dopamine-seeking 
behavior.4 A structured program of weekly classes and 
weekly weigh-ins may be especially supportive in these in- 
dividuals. However, small sample numbers prevented a 
comparison between those with and without the A1 allele. 
Because this study included volunteers who were not 
conﬁned to a metabolic ward or otherwise restricted and 
took place in their doctor’s waiting room, these ﬁndings can

reasonably translate into other clinical settings. The de- 
mographic characteristics of this study population—mostly 
older than 60 years of age and predominantly black or 
white—are similar to those of many other clinics, although 
the educational 
level of our participants may have been 
higher than for some settings. 
this 
limitations. 
Recruitment fell short of the numbers called for by the power 
analysis, because of having exhausted the patient population 
of the practice. Glycemia and plasma lipids were already well 
controlled at baseline, limiting the potential for further re- 
ductions. Nonetheless, both eating plans, presented through 
weekly class series, did indeed yield signiﬁcant improvements. 
The degree of support (weekly classes and weekly weigh- 
ins) was greater than that typically provided in the clinical 
setting. This is not a limitation to the generalizability of our 
ﬁndings; rather, the simple structured and continuing support 
provides an important model for clinical practices to consider. 
Changes in medication use complicated the interpretation 
of study ﬁndings. In a prior study by the current investigators, 
most diabetic individuals treated with insulin or insulin se- 
cretagogues required medication reductions after starting 
vegan eating plans to avoid recurrent hypoglycemia.18 The 
confounding effect of medication changes can be reduced by 
excluding patients on insulin and insulin secretagogues and 
by shortening the length of clinical trials; however, these 
steps also would reduce the generalizability of the ﬁndings. 
An additional limitation to studies in free-living partici- 
pants is the degree of uncertainty as to the extent to which 
participants have adhered to their prescribed nutrition or 
medication regimens. Food records and telephone moni- 
toring were used in an effort to minimize this problem; in 
addition, the observed changes in body weight, glycemic 
control, and plasma lipids provided some reassurance that 
participants did indeed make substantial nutrient changes. 
Although participants were asked not to alter their physical 
activity, the study took place in the late winter and spring, a 
time when physical activity would naturally increase. Par- 
ticipants in both groups increased their reported physical 
activity, particularly in the portion-controlled group, which 
may have inﬂuenced HbA1c or other variables. In addition, 
most participants lost weight, which may have inﬂuenced 
their aptitude for physical activity. 
Despite these limitations, this study has demonstrated that 
a simple program of instruction and support leads to signif- 
icant improvements in diabetes management. It was not 
adequately powered to differentiate the effects of the two 
active regimens. In future studies, testing the effects of a 
program of this type in a larger participant group with less 
well-controlled diabetes, 
lipid values, or blood pressure 
would be helpful. More research is also needed on the 
application of nutritional interventions to the prevention of 
diabetes complications. 
In conclusion, a simple program of weekly classes for in- 
struction and support, integrated into a clinical practice and 

using either a low-fat vegan or portion-controlled eating plan, 
led to clinical improvements. Because of the widespread and 
serious nature of diabetes—a leading contributor to cardio- 
vascular disease, blindness, amputations, and renal impair- 
ment—improvements in its management are of great value.
