OBJECTIVE — We sought to investigate whether a low-fat vegan diet improves glycemic 
control and cardiovascular risk factors in individuals with type 2 diabetes. 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Individuals with type 2 diabetes (n (cid:1) 99) 
were randomly assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n (cid:1) 49) or a diet following the American 
Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines (n (cid:1) 50). Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22 
weeks. 
RESULTS — Forty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of the ADA 
group participants reduced diabetes medications. Including all participants, HbA1c (A1C) de- 
creased 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P (cid:1) 
0.089). Excluding those who changed medications, A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan group 
compared with 0.38 points in the ADA group (P (cid:1) 0.01). Body weight decreased 6.5 kg in the 
vegan group and 3.1 kg in the ADA group (P (cid:2) 0.001). Body weight change correlated with A1C 
change (r (cid:1) 0.51, n (cid:1) 57, P (cid:2) 0.0001). Among those who did not change lipid-lowering 
medications, LDL cholesterol fell 21.2% in the vegan group and 10.7% in the ADA group (P (cid:1) 
0.02). After adjustment for baseline values, urinary albumin reductions were greater in the vegan 
group (15.9 mg/24h) than in the ADA group (10.9 mg/24 h) (P (cid:1) 0.013). 
CONCLUSIONS — Both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on ADA guidelines improved 
glycemic and lipid control in type 2 diabetic patients. These improvements were greater with a 
low-fat vegan diet. 


based and vegetarian diets, and 
among individuals following plant- 
clinical trials using such diets have shown 
improvements in glycemic control and 
cardiovascular health (1,2). Most of these 
trials have also included exercise, thus 
making it impossible to isolate diet ef- 
fects. In a 12-week pilot trial of a low-fat 
vegan diet in individuals with type 2 dia- 
betes, conducted without increased exer- 
cise, fasting serum glucose concentration 
dropped 28% compared with 12% in the 
control group following a diet based on 
American Diabetes Association (ADA) 
guidelines (P (cid:2) 0.05) (3). A similar diet,

used in the absence of exercise, was asso- 
ciated with increased insulin sensitivity 
and reduced body weight in nondiabetic 
overweight women (4). 
We therefore conducted a random- 
ized controlled trial of a vegan diet with 
exercise held constant to test the hypoth- 
esis that, in individuals with type 2 diabe- 
tes, a low-fat plant-based diet improves 
glycemic, plasma lipid, and weight con- 
trol compared with a diet based on cur- 
rent ADA guidelines. 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND 
METHODS — Individuals with type 2 
diabetes, deﬁned by a fasting plasma glu- 
cose concentration (cid:3)6.9 mmol/l on two 
occasions or a prior diagnosis of type 2 
diabetes with the use of hypoglycemic 
medications for (cid:1)6 months, were re- 
cruited through newspaper advertise- 
ments in the Washington, DC, area on 
two occasions (October 2003 through 
December 2003 and October 2004 
through December 2004) to complete the 
study from January 2004 through June 
2004 and January 2005 through June 
2005, respectively. Exclusion criteria 
were an HbA1c (A1C) (cid:2)6.5 or (cid:3)10.5%, 
use of insulin for (cid:3)5 years, current smok- 
ing, alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy, 
unstable medical status, and current use 
of a low-fat vegetarian diet. The protocol 
was approved by the George Washington 
University Institutional Review Board. All 
participants gave written informed 
consent. 
A1C was assayed using afﬁnity chro- 
matography on an Abbott IMx analyzer 
(5). Volunteers were ranked in order of 
A1C concentrations and randomly as- 
signed in sequential pairs, using a ran- 
dom-number table, to a low-fat vegan diet 
or a diet following the 2003 ADA guide- 
lines (6) for 22 weeks. Because assign- 
ment was done simultaneously, allocation 
concealment was unnecessary. 
The vegan diet ((cid:4)10% of energy from 
fat, 15% protein, and 75% carbohydrate) 
consisted of vegetables, fruits, grains, and 
legumes. Participants were asked to avoid 
animal products and added fats and to 


favor low– glycemic index foods, such as 
beans and green vegetables. Portion sizes, 
energy intake, and carbohydrate intake 
were unrestricted. 
The ADA diet (15–20% protein, (cid:2)7% 
saturated fat, 60 –70% carbohydrate and 
monounsaturated fats, and cholesterol 
(cid:2)200 mg/day) was individualized, based 
on body weight and plasma lipid concen- 
trations (6). ADA group participants with 
a BMI(cid:3) 25 kg/m2 (all but three ADA 
group participants) were prescribed en- 
ergy intake deﬁcits of 500 –1,000 kcal. 
No meals were provided. To meet the 
vitamin B12 needs of the vegan group 
while maintaining the same intervention 
in the ADA group, all participants were 
provided a vitamin B12 supplement (100 
(cid:5)g) to be taken every other day. For both 
groups, alcoholic beverages were limited 
to one per day for women and two per day 
for men. Participants were asked not to 
alter their exercise habits during the inter- 
vention period. 
Each participant met for 1 h with a 
registered dietitian experienced in the use 
of the assigned diet to establish an appro- 
priate diet plan. Thereafter, participants 
attended weekly 1-h meetings of their as- 
signed groups for nutrition and cooking 
instruction conducted by a physician and 
a registered dietitian and/or a cooking in- 
structor. Sessions for the two groups were 
similar in duration and content, except 
with regard to dietary details. Group lead- 
ers were instructed to make no comment 
favoring either diet over the other. 
At weeks 4, 8, 13, and 20, a registered 
dietitian made unannounced telephone 
calls to each participant to administer a 
24-h diet recall. These recalls were not 
statistically analyzed, but allowed the in- 
vestigators to check for poor adherence 
and provide additional dietary counseling 
as needed. 
In addition, a 3-day dietary record 
was completed by each participant at 
weeks 0, 11, and 22, on 2 weekdays and 1 
weekend day, using a food scale, after par- 
ticipants had completed a 3-day practice 
record. Using the Nutrition Data System 
for Research software version 5.0 (Food 
and Nutrient Database 35 [released May 
2004]; Nutrition Coordinating Center, 
University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, 
MN) (7), a registered dietitian certiﬁed by 
the Nutrition Coordinating Center ana- 
lyzed all 3-day dietary records and diet 
recalls. For purposes of statistical analy- 
sis, dietary adherence for the vegan group 
was deﬁned as the absence of meat, poul- 
try, ﬁsh, dairy, or egg intake reported on 

24-h recalls or incidentally at any point, 
as saturated fat (cid:2)5% and total fat (cid:2)25% 
of energy, and as average daily cholesterol 
intake (cid:2)50 mg on 3-day dietary records 
at 22 weeks. Adherence for the ADA 
group was deﬁned as average daily energy 
intake on the 22-week 3-day dietary 
records being no more than 200 kcal in 
excess of the intake prescribed by the reg- 
istered dietitian and saturated fat (cid:2)10% 
of energy. Individuals who attended 
fewer than 10 of the 22 weekly sessions 
were also considered nonadherent on ei- 
ther diet. 
Participants were asked to continue 
their preexisting medication regimens, 
except when fasting plasma glucose deter- 
minations fell below 4.4 mmol/l or hypo- 
glycemic symptoms were accompanied 
by a capillary glucose reading (cid:2)3.6 
mmol/l. In such cases, medications were 
reduced for participant safety by a study 
endocrinologist, who remained blind to 
group assignment, following an estab- 
lished protocol. 
Laboratory measurements were made 
after a 12-h fast by technicians blind to 
group assignment. A1C (the primary end 
point) was assayed at 0, 11, and 22 weeks, 
as described above. All other measures 
were assessed at baseline and 22 weeks, 
except as noted. Plasma glucose was mea- 
sured by the glucose oxidase method us- 
ing an Abbott Spectrum analyzer (Abbott 
Park, IL) (8). Plasma cholesterol and tri- 
glyceride concentrations were measured 
by enzymatic methods using an Abbott 
Spectrum analyzer (9,10). HDL choles- 
terol was measured after double precipi- 
tation with dextran and MgCl2 (11). LDL 
cholesterol was estimated using the 
Friedewald equation (12). In individuals 
whose plasma triglyceride concentrations 
exceeded 400 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol was 
measured directly by precipitation and 
magnetic separation (LipiDirect; Poly- 
medco, Cortlandt Manor, NY). Non-HDL 
cholesterol concentration was calculated 
as the difference between total and HDL 
cholesterol. Urinary albumin was mea- 
sured on 24-h samples using an anionic 
dye– binding assay (13). 
Physical activity was assessed over a 
3-day period by pedometer (Omron HJ- 
112) and with the Bouchard 3-Day Phys- 
ical Activity Record (14). Body weight 
was determined at 0, 11, and 22 weeks, 
before breakfast while participants wore 
hospital gowns, using a digital scale accu- 
rate to 0.1 kg. Waist circumference was 
measured with a tape measure placed 2.5 
cm above the umbilicus. Hip circumfer- 
ence was measured at the maximal pro- 
trusion of the buttocks. 
Blood pressure was measured after 
participants had rested in a seated posi- 
tion for 5 min using a digital monitor 
(Omron HEM-711) and a standard cuff 
maintained at the level of the heart. Three 
measurements were taken at 2-min inter- 
vals; the ﬁrst measurement was disre- 
garded, and a mean was calculated for the 
remaining two values. 
Statistical analyses 
To have an 80% chance of detecting a 
1.5–percentage point between-group 
A1C difference as signiﬁcant (at the two- 
sided 5% level), with an assumed SD of 
1.9% and a loss to follow-up of 26%, 34 
participants were required per group. An 
interim analysis indicated group differ- 
ences of 0.8% with an SD of 1.3%; there- 
fore, a revised power analysis was 
conducted. To have an 80% chance of de- 
tecting a 0.8% difference as signiﬁcant 
with an SD of 1.3% and loss to follow-up 
of 33%, an additional 15 participants 
were required per group. 
Between-subject t tests were calcu- 
lated for each measure to determine 
whether the changes associated with the 
intervention diet were greater than those 
associated with the control diet. Within 
each diet group, paired comparison t tests 
were calculated to test whether the 
change from baseline to 22 weeks was sig- 
niﬁcantly different from zero. The pri- 
mary analysis of the main end point was 
intention to treat and included all partic- 
ipants. Because medication changes inﬂu- 
e n c e 
t h e d e p e n d e n t m e a s u r e s , 
exploratory analyses were performed for 
the subgroup whose medications re- 
mained constant. An (cid:6) of 0.05 was used 
for all statistical tests, with no adjustment 
for multiple comparisons. 
Regression analyses assessed whether 
the diet group effects on A1C and body 
weight were signiﬁcant, while controlling 
for baseline values, and whether the diet 
group effect on A1C was signiﬁcant, while 
controlling for baseline A1C and changes 
in body weight. Pearson correlations were 
calculated for the relationship between 
A1C change and weight change. 
An interim analysis was performed af- 
ter week 11 to assess whether beneﬁts 
or adverse outcomes were statistically 
unusual.

to the vegan (n (cid:1) 49) or ADA (n (cid:1) 50) 
groups. The reasons for exclusion were 
A1C values outside the required range 
(n (cid:1) 201), failure to meet other participa- 
tion criteria (n (cid:1) 279), inability to attend 
scheduled meetings (n (cid:1) 187), failure to 
keep interview appointment (n (cid:1) 153), 
reluctance to change diet (n (cid:1) 72), and 
other or unspeciﬁed (n (cid:1) 58). The partic- 
ipants’ demographic and clinical charac- 
teristics (Table 1) were similar to those of 
individuals with type 2 diabetes in the 
Washington, DC, area. All participants 
completed laboratory assessments at 22 
weeks. 
Three vegan participants and eight 
ADA participants failed to complete 22- 
week dietary records. Both groups re- 
duced energy intake (vegan 1,759 (cid:7) 468 
to 1,425 (cid:7) 427 kcal/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001; 
ADA 1,846 (cid:7) 597 to 1,391 (cid:7) 382 kcal/ 
day, P (cid:2) 0.0001 [between-group P (cid:1) 
0.22]) and protein intake (vegan 77 (cid:7) 27 
to 51 (cid:7) 16 g/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001; ADA 85 (cid:7) 
27 to 73 (cid:7) 23 g/day, P (cid:1) 0.002 [between 
group P (cid:1) 0.01]). Carbohydrate intake 
increased in the vegan group from 205 (cid:7) 
69 to 251 (cid:7) 70 g/day (P (cid:2) 0.0001) but 
fell in the ADA group from 213 (cid:7) 70 to 
165 (cid:7) 51 g/day (P (cid:2) 0.0001 [between- 
group P (cid:2) 0.001]). 
Fat intake fell in both groups (vegan 
72 (cid:7) 28 to 30 (cid:7) 19 g/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001; 
ADA 73 (cid:7) 35 to 52 (cid:7) 21 g/day, P (cid:2) 
0.0001 [between-group P (cid:1) 0.002]), as 
did saturated fat (vegan 23 (cid:7) 10 to 6 (cid:7) 4 



g/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001; ADA 23 (cid:7) 12 to 14 (cid:7) 
6 g/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001 [between-group P (cid:2) 
0.001]) and cholesterol (vegan 291 (cid:7) 
223 to 24 (cid:7) 57 mg/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001; ADA 
317 (cid:7) 200 to 189 (cid:7) 89 mg/day, P (cid:2) 
0.0001 [between-group P (cid:1) 0.002]). Fi- 
ber increased only among vegans (18.8 (cid:7) 
6.4 to 36.3 (cid:7) 13.3 g/day, P (cid:2) 0.0001; 
ADA 19.5 (cid:7) 6.9 to 19.0 (cid:7) 7.9 g/day, P (cid:1) 
0.73 [between-group P (cid:2) 0.001]). 
Pedometer readings and self-reported 
energy expenditure revealed no signiﬁ- 
cant between-group differences. Group- 
speciﬁc dietary adherence criteria were 
met by 67% (33 of 49) of vegan group 
participants and 44% (22 of 50) of ADA 
group participants. During the interven- 
tion period, 43% (21 of 49) of vegan 
group participants and 26% (13 of 50) of 
ADA group participants reduced their di- 
abetes medications, mainly as necessi- 
tated by hypoglycemia, while 8% (4 of 
49) of vegans and 8% (4 of 50) of ADA 
participants increased medications with- 
out investigators’ authorization. 
A1C fell 0.96 percentage points (P (cid:2) 
0.0001) in the vegan group and 0.56 per- 
centage points (P (cid:1) 0.0009) in the ADA 
group (between-group P (cid:1) 0.089; base- 
line-adjusted P (cid:1) 0.091; Table 2 and Fig. 
1). Among participants whose diabetes 
medications remained unchanged 
throughout (n (cid:1) 24 vegan and n (cid:1) 33 
ADA), A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan 
group and 0.38 points in the ADA group 
(P (cid:1) 0.01; baseline-adjusted P (cid:1) 0.007). 
Subanalyses were conducted to assess the 
effects of dietary adherence. For those 
who met adherence criteria (n (cid:1) 33 vegan 
and n (cid:1) 22 ADA), the A1C changes were 
(cid:8)1.20% for the vegan group and 
(cid:8)0.88% for the ADA group (P (cid:1) 0.31). 
For those who were both adherent and 
medication stable (n (cid:1) 17 vegan and n (cid:1) 
12 ADA), A1C changes were (cid:8)1.48% for 
the vegan group and (cid:8)0.81% for the ADA 
group (P (cid:1) 0.15). 
To test whether the effect of diet on 
A1C was mediated by body weight 
changes, a regression model was con- 
structed, including baseline A1C, weight 
change, and diet group as predictors of 
A1C change, among those whose hypo- 
glycemic medications remained constant. 
In this model, the effect of diet group was 
no longer signiﬁcant (P (cid:1) 0.23). Control- 
ling for diet group and for baseline A1C 
scores, weight change was signiﬁcantly 
associated with A1C change; each kilo- 
gram of weight loss was associated with a 
0.12% drop in A1C. For the subgroup 
that did not change diabetes medications, 










the Pearson’s correlation of weight change 
with A1C change was r (cid:1) 0.51, P (cid:2) 
0.0001 (within the vegan group [n (cid:1) 24], 
r (cid:1) 0.39, P (cid:1) 0.05; within the ADA group 
[n (cid:1) 33], r (cid:1) 0.49, P (cid:1) 0.004). 
Body weight fell 5.8 kg in the vegan 
group (P (cid:2) 0.0001) and 4.3 kg in the 
ADA group (P (cid:2) 0.0001) (between-group 
P (cid:1) 0.082; baseline-adjusted P (cid:1) 0.066). 
Among medication-stable participants, 
vegan participants lost 6.5 kg compared 
with 3.1 kg for ADA participants (P (cid:2) 
0.001; baseline-adjusted P (cid:1) 0.001). 
The reduction in urinary albumin was 
signiﬁcant in the vegan group (P (cid:1) 0.002) 
but not in the ADA group (P (cid:1) 0.14). The 
unadjusted between-group difference 
was not signiﬁcant. However, after adjust- 
ment for baseline values, the effect of diet 
was signiﬁcant (P (cid:1) 0.013). 
For the entire sample, there were no 
between-group differences in lipid val- 
ues. Among those whose lipid-controlling 
medications remained constant (80% [39 
of 49] of vegan group, 82% [41 of 50] of 
ADA group), reductions in total choles- 
terol were (cid:8)0.866 mmol/l ((cid:8)33.5 mg/dl, 
(cid:8)17.6%) for the vegan group and 
(cid:8)0.491 mmol/l ((cid:8)19.0 mg/dl, (cid:8)9.7%) 
for the ADA group (P (cid:1) 0.0125). Changes 
in LDL cholesterol were (cid:8)0.58 mmol/l 
((cid:8)22.6 mg/dl, (cid:8)21.2%) for the vegan 
group and (cid:8)0.277 mmol/l ((cid:8)10.7 mg/dl, 
(cid:8)9.3%) for the ADA group (P (cid:1) 0.023). 
Changes in HDL cholesterol were (cid:8)0.16 
mmol/l ((cid:8)6.0 mg/dl, (cid:8)11.0%) for the 
vegan group and (cid:8)0.07 mmol/l ((cid:8)2.8 
mg/dl, (cid:8)5.7%) for the ADA group (P (cid:1) 
0.14). The total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio 
fell for both groups, as did triglyceride 
concentrations. 


CONCLUSIONS — Both diets were 
associated with signiﬁcant clinical im- 
provements, as indicated by reductions in 
A1C, body weight, plasma lipid concen- 
trations, and urinary albumin excretion. 
Among medication-stable participants, 
changes in A1C, weight, BMI, waist cir- 
cumference, total cholesterol, and LDL 
cholesterol were signiﬁcantly greater in 
the vegan group. The magnitude of A1C 
reduction in medication-stable vegan 
group participants, 1.23 percentage 
points, compares favorably with that ob- 
served in single-agent therapy with oral 
diabetes drugs (15). 
A low-fat plant-based diet inﬂuences 
nutrient intake and body composition in 
several ways that may, in turn, affect in-

sulin sensitivity. First, because such diets 
are low in fat and high in ﬁber, they typ- 
ically cause associated reductions in di- 
etary energy density and energy intake, 
which are not fully compensated for by 
increased food intake (16,17). Our data 
suggest that the weight-reducing effect of 
the vegan diet (4) is responsible for a sub- 
stantial portion of its effect on A1C. 
Independent of their effect on body 
weight, reductions in total fat intake and 
in the proportion of dietary saturated to 
unsaturated fat increase insulin sensitivity 
(18), as do increased intake of low– 
glycemic index and high-ﬁber foods (1). 
Finally, limited evidence suggests 
that reductions in iron stores increase in- 
sulin sensitivity (19). A vegan diet pro- 
vides iron in its nonheme form, which is 
somewhat less absorbable than heme 
iron. A study comparing 30 ovolactoveg- 
etarians and 30 meat eaters, all of whom 
were healthy and had BMIs (cid:2)23 kg/m2, 
showed that vegetarians had adequate, 
but lower, body iron stores, compared 
with meat eaters (serum ferritin concen- 
tration 35 (cid:5)g/l [95% CI 21– 49] vs. 72 
(cid:5)g/l [45–100]). The vegetarians also 
demonstrated less insulin resistance 
(steady-state plasma glucose concentra- 
tion 4.1 mmol/l [3.5–5.0] vs. 6.9 mmol/l 
[5.2–7.5], respectively) (19). 
Insulin resistance is related to lipid 
accumulation within muscle cells (in- 
tramyocellular lipid), apparently due to a 
genetically based reduction in mitochon- 
drial activity identiﬁable many years be- 

fore diabetes manifests (20). This lipid 
accumulation may be responsive to diet. 
High-fat diets appear to downregulate the 
genes required for mitochondrial oxida- 
tive phosphorylation in skeletal muscle 
(21). In contrast, a case-control study 
found that soleus muscle intramyocellu- 
lar lipid concentrations were signiﬁcantly 
lower in a group of 21 vegans compared 
with 25 omnivores ((cid:8)9.7 [95% CI (cid:8)16.2 
to (cid:8)3.3], P (cid:1) 0.01) (22). 
The lipid-lowering effect of vegan di- 
ets, attributable to their absence of dietary 
cholesterol, low saturated fat content, and 
a speciﬁc cholesterol-reducing effect of 
soluble ﬁber and other plant constituents 
(23), is particularly important given that 
cardiovascular complications are the pri- 
mary cause of morbidity and mortality in 
diabetes. While diets high in reﬁned car- 
bohydrate may increase triglyceride con- 
centrations, high-ﬁber and low– glycemic 
index foods appear to have the opposite 
result (24). 
The limited compliance of the ADA 
group merits comment. Researchers have 
long lamented the difﬁculties in adhering 
to diets for diabetes (25). The A1C reduc- 
tion observed in the ADA group was sim- 
ilar to that found in previous studies (26). 
A potential weakness of the ADA guide- 
lines is that they require portion size lim- 
its for overweight individuals, and 
limitations on saturated-fat intake are 
based on these limited energy intakes. In- 
dividuals who exceed their prescribed en- 
ergy intake limits with overly large 
portions can, as a result, easily exceed rec- 
ommended limits on saturated fat. In con- 
trast, the vegan diet includes no animal 
fat, so variations in food quantity are less 
likely to result in substantial increases in 
saturated fat intake. Because the vegan 
diet is based on the elimination of certain 
foods, it may be easier to understand than 
regimens that limit quantities of certain 
foods without proscribing any. The ac- 
ceptability of low-fat vegan diets in clini- 
cal studies is similar to that of seemingly 
more moderate diets (27). 
This study’s strengths include its 
analysis of dependent measures without 
regard to variations in dietary adherence 
and applicability outside the research set- 
ting. A study limitation was that both di- 
ets made participants vulnerable to the 
hypoglycemic effect of their diabetes 
medications, resulting in medication re- 
ductions that confound the interpretation 
of A1C changes and necessitating a sub- 
group analysis of medication-stable par- 
ticipants. Because these episodes 
occurred early in the trial, there was no 
opportunity to bring interim laboratory 
values forward. Also, most study partici- 
pants were taking antihypertensive med- 
ications, which may have blunted the 
effect of diet on blood pressure. 
In conclusion, in individuals with 
type 2 diabetes participating in a 22-week 
clinical trial, both a low-fat vegan diet and 
a diet following ADA guidelines improved 
glycemic control; however, the changes 
were greater in the vegan group. Further 
research is necessary to establish longer- 
term diet effects and sustainability.
