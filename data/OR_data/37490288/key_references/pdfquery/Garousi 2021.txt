Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most com- 
mon cause of liver disease worldwide, with NAFLD being 
defined as evidence of excessive hepatic fat accumulation in 
the absence of remarkable alcohol consumption and second- 
ary causes of hepatic steatosis 
(Chalasani et al. 2012, 
Mansour-Ghanaei et al. 2019). NAFLD affects nearly 14–30% 
of the general population in different parts of the world, and 
it appears that it will dramatically increase over the next two 
decades (Bellentani 2017, Mansour-Ghanaei et al. 2018). The 
exact aetiology of NAFLD is not clearly understood. However, 
several non-modifiable factors, such as age, race, genetic 
background, and baseline histology, as well as a number of 
modifiable factors 
including inappropriate diet, physical 
insulin resistance, and drug abuse 
inactivity, weight gain, 
have been suggested as the most common contributors in 
the onset and progression of NAFLD (Abenavoli et al. 2016, 
Hsu et al. 2017). The NAFLD spectrum ranges from simple 
hepatic steatosis without evidence of hepatocyte injury to 
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with an associated hep- 
if NAFLD is not managed 
atocellular injury. 

appropriately, 
it may progress to chronic liver damage, 
including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Angulo 
2002, Loomba and Sanyal 2013). Thus, determining the 
proper treatment is an important issue faced by healthcare 
systems globally. Currently, 
lifestyle modifications (in the 
form of a healthy diet, physical exercise, and weight loss) 
remain the cornerstone of NAFLD management (Liver and 
Diabetes 2016). Implementing a weight-loss diet in the form 
of caloric restriction, which is standard for omnivorous peo- 
ple, is the most important intervention for NAFLD treatment, 
and can reduce visceral, subcutaneous, and hepatic fat, as 
(Clark and Diehl 2003, 
well as promoting weight 
Fontana et al. 2004). Researches have shown that NAFLD 
patients who lose 5–7% of their total body weight show 
improvements in liver enzymes, hepatic fat, insulin sensitivity, 
and histological changes (Huang et al. 2005, Clark 2006, 
Ratziu 2017). 

A lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (LOV-D), which characterised 
by variable servings of dairy and eggs as well as vegetables 
and grains, has long been posited to be beneficial for gen- 
eral health and, in particular, cardiovascular health (Rajaram 
2003, Rosell 2006). Adherence to this diet is associated with

ABSTRACT 
The aim of the study was to compare the effects of a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (LOV-D) vs. a standard 
weight-loss diet (SWL-D) on obese/overweight adults with NAFLD. Present randomised clinical trial 
recruited 75 overweight/obese adults with NAFLD, who were randomly assigned into LOV-D and SWL- 
D groups for 3 months. The LOV-D was designed based on eliminating meat, poultry, and fish; while 
including dairy products and eggs. The SWL-D was planned according to the standard food pyramid, 
which was free in all sources of food. Adherence to LOV-D significantly outperformed SWL-D in reduc- 
ing levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), body weight, waist circumference, BMI, fasting blood 
sugar, insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triacylglycerol (TG), chol- 
esterol, 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Furthermore, 
ultrasonography revealed a higher alleviation in NAFLD grade among LOV-D, compared with SWL-D. 
This study suggests that adherence to LOV-D for 3 months has beneficial effects on NAFLD improve- 
ment, anthropometric measures, glycaemic-related markers, and lipid profiles. 


improved lipid profiles (Yang et al. 2012) and lower weight 
gain (Burke et al. 2008) in comparison with the western diet. 
Additionally, studies have suggested that a vegetarian diet is 
more acceptable among many people, who are more satis- 
fied to follow it for a longer period in compare with other 
weight-loss diets (Smith et al. 2000, Burke et al. 2007). As a 
vegetarian diet is usually high in calcium, magnesium, anti- 
oxidant constituents, and fibre, it can improve human insulin 
sensitivity, regardless of weight loss or physical activity (Ard 
et al. 2004). Although a standard weight-loss diet (SWL-D) 
for 
has long been suggested as a front-line treatment 
NAFLD, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of 
LOV-D on NAFLD in comparison with SWL-D. Given all the 
effectiveness of LOV-D on metabolic markers that involve in 
NAFLD development/progression, a hypothesis regarding the 
beneficial clinical application of LOV-D can be laid down. 
Therefore, this study was conducted to compare and deter- 
mine the effects of LOV-D and SWL-D on obese and over- 
weight adults with NAFLD. 


Patients were identified and recruited from February to April 
2018. 
Inclusion criteria required participants to have been 
diagnosed with NAFLD, to be motivated to participate in the 
study, aged between 20 and 55 years, obese or overweight 
(BMI > 25 kg/m2), and non-consumers of alcohol 
(<40 g/ 
week). NAFLD was diagnosed by an ultrasonography scan 
and associated with a persistently elevated alanine amino- 
than 19 U/L for 
transferase (ALT) concentration higher 
women and 30 U/L for men (Prati et al. 2002). Participants 
were excluded from the study if they were following a spe- 
cial diet, pregnant, breastfeeding, or suffering from viral 
hepatitis, diabetes mellitus, untreated hypothyroidism or 
other causes of chronic liver disease. The sample size was 
calculated based on the type one error (a) ¼0.05 and power 
¼ 0.80%. Considering 20% potential dropout, 80 patients 
were estimated as the final sample size. This study was a sin- 
gle-centre, randomised clinical trial. The study protocol was 
approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of 
Medical Sciences (IR.MUI.REC.1396.3.249) and retrospectively 
trial 
registered 
(IRCT20140208016529N2). This study was also conducted in 
accordance with the CONSORT guidelines. 





regime, and not to consume any supplements and/or medi- 
cation which might affect the outcomes of interest. All sub- 
jects received their dietary plan at the beginning of each 
month for 3 months. The participants’ adherence to the 
administration of diets was monitored weekly by phone 
interview. In addition, subjects were asked to complete a 3-d 
dietary record in order to determine compliance with the 
study’s dietary goals. 

Both diets were caloric-restricted and involved 500 kcal less 
than the energy requirements computed individually for 
each subject. The total energy requirements of each patient 
Jeor equation, 
were calculated by using the Mifflin-St. 
according to resting energy expenditure and the individual’s 
physical activity levels (Mifflin et al. 1990). Both diets were 
planned to consist of approximately 50–55% energy from 
carbohydrates, 15–20% from protein, and 25–30% from total 
fat. The LOV-D was designed based on restraining in the 
consumption of meat and meat products, poultry, fish and 
seafood, and flesh of any other animal; but, consisted of diet- 
ary products and eggs as well as all the other food groups. 
In this regard, LOV-D nearly included protein sources from 
egg (24%), dairy (19%), gluten (26%), soy (16%), nuts (8%), 
vegetables, and fruits (7%). The SWL-D was planned accord- 
ing to the food pyramid, in which all sources of food were 
freely available. Approximately 18% of protein sources in 
SWL-D provided from meat and meat products, poultry, fish 
and seafood, and flesh of any other animal. 

A 10 mL blood sample was drawn from participants after a 
12-h overnight fast to determine the concentration of liver 
lipid profiles, and glycaemic status markers. All 
enzymes, 
samples were well-stored in the laboratory at (cid:2)80 (cid:3)C before 
lipid 
analysis. Fasting plasma glucose (FBS), fasting insulin, 
profile including triacylglycerol 
(TC), 
(TG), total cholesterol 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and liver enzymes, such as 
ALT and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured by 
an enzymatic method (Pars Azmoon Co. kit, Tehran, 
Iran); 
serum insulin concentration was measured by an ELISA kit 
(Lise-Meitner-Straße, Kiel, Germany). The homeostasis model 
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated by 
a previously described formula (Pisprasert et al. 2013). 


All participants who were eligible to study were entered into 
a two-week run-in period. They were requested to provide 
signed written 
their demographic 
informed consent. After 
the two-week run-in period, 80 
NAFLD patients were randomly assigned to the LOV-D or 
SWL-D groups for three months. Randomisation was per- 
formed using SPSS software version 21 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) 
and was stratified according to age, sex, and BMI. Patients 
routine physical activity 
were instructed to follow their 
Anthropometric measurements and 
ultrasonographic assessment 
Anthropometric indices, including body weight, height, and 
waist circumference were measured by the expert staff at 
the beginning of the study and after the 12-week interven- 
tion. The weight and height of participants were measured 
while wearing light clothing and no shoes to a precision of 
0.1 cm (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Waist circumference was 
quantified midway between the last rib and the iliac crest. 
BMI was calculated as weight in kg divided by height in 
metres squared. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) were measured 3 times after 5 min of 
rest using a mercury sphygmomanometer (ALPK2, Zhejiang, 
China; Datis Co, Tehran, Iran). The average of the three meas- 
urements was then recorded and used in the analyses. 
An ultrasonography blinded assessment was made to 
determine the extent of hepatic steatosis at the beginning 
and end of the study. Fatty infiltration of the liver was 
graded from 0 to III, which indicated normal liver, mild, mod- 
erate, and severe steatosis, respectively, based on several 
parameters, 
including the attenuation of echogenicity, 
blurred vessels, the liver-to-kidney contrast ratio, and the 
brightness of the liver. As this approach is observational, 
each assessment was repeated by another radiologist to con- 
firm the result. 

In order to evaluate dietary intakes, participants received a 3- 
d food record at the beginning, middle, and end of the trial. 
The subjects were instructed to record their daily dietary 
intake for three non-consecutive days (two weekdays and 
one weekend day). The data of the food record then was 
(First 
analysed using Nutritionist 
Databank, San Bruno, CA), modified for Iranian foods. 
In 
order to enhance the accuracy of the portion size assess- 
ment, food scales, and models, as well as national food com- 
position tables, were used as a reference guide for 
participants (Ghaffarpour et al. 1999). Physical activity was 
also examined by using the metabolic equivalent of task 
(MET) questionnaire (Ainsworth et al. 2000) at the beginning 
and end of the trial. 



The primary outcome was a significant decrease in ALT and 
AST blood levels. The secondary outcome measurements 
included changes in anthropometric values, insulin metabolic 
markers, 
lipid profiles, blood pressure, and NAFLD grade 
among participants. 


results are expressed as means and standard deviation. 
p < .05 is considered as statistically significant. 


A total of 80 NAFLD patients who met the eligibility criteria 
were randomly assigned into the LOV-D or SWL-D groups. 
During the 3 months follow-up, 
three participants were 
excluded due to having over 10% discontinued intervention 
(n ¼ 2) and emigration (n ¼ 1) from the LOV-D group. Also, 
two patients dropped out of the SWL-D group because of 
over 10% discontinued intervention (n ¼ 1) and travel (n ¼ 1). 
The attrition rate was not significantly different between the 
two groups. Finally, 75 subjects were included in the final 
analysis (Figure 1). 
Table 1 displays the demographic characteristics of the 
two groups at the beginning of the study. Except grade of 
NAFLD, there were no significant differences between indi- 
following the LOV-D and SWL-D in terms of 
viduals 
anthropometric 
demographic 
information. 


Based on the 3-d dietary records, no significant difference 
was found between the two groups at the trial baseline. In 
addition, physical activity was not significantly different 
between the two groups pre- and post-intervention (Table 
2). No adverse effect was reported among participants 
throughout the study. 

The liver enzyme concentrations, 
including ALT and AST, 
were significantly reduced after the 3-month intervention in 
comparison with the baseline values in both groups. The 
ALT/AST was significantly decreased in the LOV-D group 
(p < .001), whereas the reduction of ALT/AST did not reach 
significance in the SWL-D group (p ¼ .078). Adherence to 
LOV-D resulted in a more significant 
reduction in ALT 
((cid:2)21.32 ± 19.77 vs. (cid:2)10.15 ± 20.30; p ¼ .04), but not in and 
AST ((cid:2)8.51 ± 11.25 vs. (cid:2)4.15 ± 9.82; p ¼ .08) and ALT/AST 
(p ¼ .47), in comparison with SWL-D (Table 3). 


Statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS software 
version 21 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). The Kolmogorov–Smirnov 
test was applied to assess the normality of variables distribu- 
tion. Based on the normality of data distribution, a paired- 
sample t-test was used to evaluate the change of each vari- 
able from baseline values. Due to the comparison of changes 
between the LOV-D and SWL-D groups, group comparison 
procedures (including an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test, 
repeated measures ANOVA, 
independent t-test, or the Chi- 
square test) were performed, with respect to the type of vari- 
ables. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test was applied 
to compare the effects of LOV-D and SWL-D on the main 
identified covariates. All 
outcomes while controlling for

In comparison with SWL-D, a 
more significant reduction in body weight ((cid:2)5.85 ± 3.09 vs.

vs. 
(cid:2)2.38 ± 1.72; p < .001) were observed in the LOV-D group. 
Within-group differences demonstrated significant reductions 
in TG, TC, LDL-C, FBS, 
insulin, and HOMA-IR in the LOV-D 
group. Adherence to the LOV-D diet resulted in significant 
decreases in TG ((cid:2)48.00 ± 78.20 vs. 10.07 ± 78.54; p ¼ .006),

This study revealed that LOV-D has a greater weight 
reduction effect compared with SWL-D. Although the energy 
intake in LOV-D was less than SWL-D, and it seems that this 
difference may be the cause of the greater weight reduction 
the trend of change in energy intake during 
in LOV-D, 
In addition, 
3 months was not significant between them. 
after controlling for energy intake and other potential con- 
founders, 
loss effect of diet was more pro- 
nounced in LOV-D groups. Only sparse data has investigated 
whether a vegetarian diet differs in terms of weight-loss effi- 
cacy. In line with the current results, a study (Valachovi(cid:1)cov(cid:3)a 
et al. 2006) which matched vegetarians and non-vegetarians 
revealed that non-vegetarians had higher insulin, glucose, 
and homeostasis model assessment measurements than veg- 
etarians. Also, this study showed that vegetarianism has a 
protective effect on BMI. In contrast with the current results, 
Burke et al. (2007) indicated that adherence to LOV-D has no 
prior effect on anthropometry measurements, compared with 
SWL-D in overweight and obese adults. The cause of this 
inconsistency might be due to declining adherence in 
abstaining from meat and meat-related products over time, 
as implicated in the study (Burke et al. 2007). 
The main difference between LOV-D and SWL-D is in 
terms of its prohibition of meat. Previous studies have shown 
that high meat intake is associated with a higher risk of dia- 
betes type 2, through increases in glucose intolerance and 
impaired insulin sensitivity. Although diabetes and insulin 
resistance are well-known as NAFLD risk factors, the direct 
effect of meat on NAFLD has not been investigated. A cross- 
sectional study suggested that meat intake, such as lamb, 
beef, liver, sausage, chicken, and turkey was higher in NAFLD 
patients, in comparison with healthy adults (Zelber-Sagi et al. 
2007). However, more studies are needed to investigate the 
direct effects of meat and related products on NAFLD and its 
metabolic parameters, especially liver enzymes. 
The role of higher energy intake on NAFLD risks has been 
well-documented (Wehmeyer et al. 2016). However, the rela- 
tionship between NAFLD and diet is complicated and is not 
solely limited to energy intake. Several studies have shown 
that NAFLD patients have higher carbohydrate intake, 
in 
comparison to healthy controls (Cortez-Pinto et al. 2006, 
Volynets et al. 2012). In addition, results have indicated that 
protein intake in NAFLD patients is higher than in healthy 
participants (Cortez-Pinto et al. 2006, Volynets et al. 2012,

Wehmeyer et al. 2016). Diet with higher vegetables and fruits 
content provides lower energy density and can act as an 
essential factor in weight management. However, the role of 
vegetables and fruits is not limited to their associations with 
lower energy density. They also contain polyphenols and car- 
otenoids, which can improve metabolic homeostasis, act as 
anti-inflammatory factors, and suppress hepatic stellate cell 
activation (Salomone et al. 2016). 
A possible mechanism underlying the efficacy of LOV-D 
on NAFLD might be its high vegetable and fruit content, 
along with the elimination of meat consumption. Obesity 
and insulin resistance are the important risk factors for the 
onset of NAFLD, which can increase excess fat deposition in 
hepatocytes and elevate hepatocyte lipotoxicity and oxida- 
tive stress (Yang et al. 2010). Impaired insulin signalling, due 
to compensatory hyperinsulinemia, also provides more 


patients’ diet was assessed by 3-d food record and checked 
against the participant’s compliance with the advised diet. 
Furthermore, the subjects in control group consumed more 
kcal than those in intervention group which may impact on 
the results. Due to this reason, the results were adjusted 
energy intake as well as other confounders to minimise such 
unfavourable effect and enhance accuracy of conclusion. 
Lastly, due to the limitations of the study’s resources, ultra- 
sonography was used to diagnose and detect NAFLD 
improvement instead of a fibroscan test. Although ultrason- 
ography is a validated method for NAFLD detection (Hernaez 
et al. 2011), there are more precise tests in terms of the 
quantification of hepatic fat content (Barchetta et al. 2016). 
In this regard, 
liver enzyme levels, which have been used 
clinically as surrogate diagnostic and monitoring markers of 
NAFLD (Eliades et al. 2013), were measured to enhance the 
overall accuracy of the results. Also, due to the small number 
of participants, the results cannot be generalised to large- 
scale population groups. 

This study suggested that LOV-D is more effective in treating 
NAFLD, compared with SWL-D. Although SWL-D has been 
known as the first-line treatment 
for NAFLD, the results 
revealed LOV-D can be a promising therapy, having a greater 
impact in comparison with SWL-D. In addition, following the 
LOV-D resulted in several beneficial 
impacts on general 
health, 
including promoting human health and warding off 
chronic disease risk factors. Future studies of longer duration 
are warranted to confirm these results.

gested that the gut microbiome population is fundamentally 
different in individuals with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syn- 
drome, and NAFLD (Parnell et al. 2012). The pivotal role of 
the gut-liver axis in the onset and progress of NAFLD is well- 
documented (Eslamparast et al. 2013). Gut-derived lipopoly- 
saccharides, which are produced by gram-negative bacteria, 
can induce liver injury. 
It can result in metabolic deregula- 
tion, gut permeability, elevated hepatic oxidative stress, and 
fibrosis (Jirillo et al. 2002, Abu-Shanab and Quigley 2010). 
The effect of LOV-D on NAFLD might therefore also be 
related to its fibre content, and how it acts as a prebiotic.

Prebiotics can modify gut microbiota, 
growth, stimulate the bacterial products of short-chain fatty 
acids, and improve lipid and glucose metabolism (Parnell 
et al. 2012). Also, the prebiotics can improve liver function 
and alleviate levels of ALT and AST (Daubioul et al. 2005). 
With regard to the expected difficulties in encouraging 
subjects to adhere to specific diets and the high projected 
rate of attrition during the study, there was excellent reten- 
tion after 3 months in the trial. In addition, adjustments were 
made in the results to account for major potential confound- 
ers. However, there are several 
limitations that should be 
considered when interpreting the data. First, due to the 
nature of dietary interventions, blinding was not applicable, 
which might have resulted in reporting bias. Second, the 
study duration was relatively short. However, even over this 
time period, it was possible to show the prominent beneficial 
effects of LOV-D on NAFLD treatment. Third, the patients’ 
adherence to the diet relied on self-reporting, which might 
have resulted in misstatements. To manage this bias, the
