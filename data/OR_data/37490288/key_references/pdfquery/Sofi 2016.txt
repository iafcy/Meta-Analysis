cardiovascular disease prevention (the 
CARDIVEG study): study protocol for a 
randomized controlled trial

Background: Nutrition is able to alter the cardiovascular health of the general population. However, the optimal 
dietary strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention is still far from being defined. Mediterranean and vegetarian 
diets are those reporting the greatest grade of evidence in the literature, but no experimental studies comparing 
these two dietary patterns are available. 
Methods/design: This is an open randomized crossover clinical trial including healthy subjects with a low-to- 
medium cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by being overweight and by the presence of at least an additional 
metabolic risk factor (abdominal obesity, high total cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, impaired 
glucose fasting levels) but free from medications. A total of 100 subjects will be included and randomly assigned to 
two groups: Mediterranean calorie-restricted diet (n = 50) and vegetarian calorie-restricted diet (n = 50). The 
intervention phases will last 3 months each, and at the end of intervention phase I the groups will be crossed over. 
The two diets will be isocaloric and of three different sizes (1400 – 1600 – 1800 kcal/day), according to specific 
energy requirements. Adherence to the dietary intervention will be established through questionnaires and 24-h 
dietary recall. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood samples and stool samples will be obtained 
from each participant at the beginning and at the end of each intervention phase. The primary outcome measure 
will be change in weight from baseline. The secondary outcome measures will be variations of anthropometric and 
bioelectrical impedance variables as well as traditional and innovative cardiovascular biomarkers. 
Discussion: Despite all the data supporting the efficacy of Mediterranean and vegetarian diets on the prevention 
of cardiovascular diseases, no studies have directly compared these two dietary profiles. The trial will test whether 
there are statistically significant differences between these dietary profiles in reducing the cardiovascular risk burden 
for the general population.

Background 
Nutrition is able to substantially alter the health status 
of the general population [1]. In industrialized countries 
the most important association between diet and health 
is the relationship with cardiovascular disease, the lead- 
ing cause of death and disability worldwide. Therefore, 
the ability to identify with certainty the relationship be- 
tween diet and cardiovascular disease appears to be a 
key element in the implementation of specific primary 
prevention strategies [2]. Recent studies have focussed 
their interest on the impact of a whole dietary approach 
rather than on isolating single nutrients on the occur- 
rence of cardiovascular disease; it is recognized that ana- 
lyses of single nutrients ignore the important and 
complex interactions between components of a diet and, 
more importantly, ignore the fact that people do not eat 
isolated nutrients [3, 4]. However, an optimal dietary 
strategy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease has 
not been found [5]. 
Several models of diet have been imposed on public 
attention, but those that have received the most interest 
are the Mediterranean and vegetarian diets [6, 7]. These 
dietary patterns seem to exert protective effects on blood 
pressure, lipid profiles, cardiovascular diseases and meta- 
bolic parameters. 
The term Mediterranean diet has been widely used to 
describe the traditional dietary habits of people in Crete, 
South Italy and other Mediterranean countries during 
the decade of the 1960s. This dietary pattern is charac- 
terized by plentiful plant-derived foods (fruits, vegeta- 
bles, breads, other forms of cereals, beans, nuts and 
seeds), olive oil as the principal source of fat, moderate 
amounts of dairy products (mainly cheese and yogurt), 
low-to-moderate amounts of fish and meat and a moder- 
ate consumption, usually with meals. Since the results of 
the first data from the Seven Countries Study, several 
studies in different populations have established a bene- 
ficial role for the main components of the Mediterra- 
nean diet on the occurrence of cardiovascular and 
chronic degenerative diseases [8]. Recently, a meta- 
analysis conducted by our group has revealed, in a popu- 
lation of more than 2 million people, that a strict adher- 
ence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern is associated 
with a significant improvement in health status, as seen 
by a significant reduction in overall mortality (10 %) and 
incidence of and/or mortality from cardiovascular dis- 
eases (9 %) [9]. 
A vegetarian diet is a dietary profile characterized by 
abstention from consuming meat and meat products, 
poultry, seafood and flesh from any other animal. In the 
past few decades, some case-control and cohort pro- 
spective studies reported beneficial effects of this dietary 
profile on the occurrence of cardiovascular and neoplas- 
tic disease. Very recently, our group conducted a 
systematic review with a meta-analysis on more than 
120,000 vegetarians, showing that adherence to a vege- 
tarian dietary pattern helps to determine, among case- 
control studies, lower levels of the most important risk 
factor for chronic disease, along with a reduced risk of 
occurrence for ischemic heart disease (–25 %) when co- 
hort prospective studies were taken into account [10]. 
Despite all these findings, however, to the best of our 
knowledge, no randomized controlled trial that com- 
pares, in the same group of patients, the efficacy of nu- 
tritional 
interventions based on Mediterranean and 
vegetarian dietary patterns is available in the literature. 
To date, it is unclear whether the supposed health bene- 
fits for vegetarians can be attributed to the absence of 
meat in the diet, to the increased consumption of par- 
ticular food component(s), to the pattern of foods eaten 
within the vegetarian diet or to other healthy lifestyle 
components often associated with vegetarianism. 
Hence, we aimed to design this randomized, open, 
crossover clinical trial that will test whether there is a 
difference between a vegetarian calorie-restricted diet 
and a Mediterranean calorie-restricted diet in reducing 
total weight and ameliorating the cardiovascular risk 
profile of a clinically healthy group of subjects. 

Methods/design 
Study design and setting 
The randomized, open, crossover clinical trial will be 
the 
conducted at 
Careggi University Hospital, Florence, Italy. A crossover 
design will be implemented to allow comparison of the 
vegetarian and Mediterranean diets within the same in- 
dividual. Participants will act as their own controls in 
crossover studies, so individual differences will be con- 
trolled for, making the error variance smaller and subse- 
quently reducing the sample size required to find a 
significant effect due to increased statistical power. This 
design will also be adopted in an effort to minimize at- 
trition and to maximize participant interest and compli- 
ance by enabling each participant to experience both 
diet conditions. The study design follows the SPIRIT 
guidelines (see Additional files 1 and 2). 
Eligibility criteria 
Eligible participants will be clinically healthy subjects 
(aged 18–75 years) with a low-to-medium cardiovascular 
risk profile (1–5 % according to the guidelines of the 
European Society of Cardiology) [11], determined by be- 
ing overweight (body mass index >25.1 kg/m2) and by 
the concomitant presence of at least one of the following 
criteria: 




(cid:1) Circulating levels of total cholesterol >190 mg/dL, 
not on drug treatment (measured no more than 
3 months prior to the start of the study) 
(cid:1) Circulating levels of LDL cholesterol >115 mg/dL, 
not on drug treatment (measured no more than 
3 months prior to the start of the study) 

on drug treatment (measured no more than 
3 months prior to the start of the study) 

dL but <126 mg/dL, not on drug treatment 
(measured no more than 3 months prior to the start 
of the study) 

Exclusion criteria are the presence of a current serious 
illness or unstable condition that requires physician 
supervision of diet or physical activity (e.g. recent myo- 
cardial 
inflammatory 
bowel diseases); pregnancy or intention to become preg- 
nant in the next 18 months; lactation; current or recent 
(past 6 months) participation in weight loss treatment 
program or use of weight loss medication; no regular in- 
take of meat, fish or poultry for the past month. 
Interventions and participant timeline 
This clinical randomized study of vegetarian and Medi- 
terranean diets will use a crossover design with two 
intervention periods. After a 2-week run-in period, the 
eligible participants will be randomly assigned into two 
groups: either the group which will receive a vegetarian 
diet or the group which will receive a Mediterranean 
diet. Following the first intervention phase, the partici- 
pants will be crossed over in order to obtain the second 
intervention phase. Each diet period will be 3 months 
long. The vegetarian diet will not contain meat, poultry 
or fish but will contain eggs and dairy, in addition to 
plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, legumes, nuts and seeds. The Mediterranean diet 
will contain all foods, including meat, poultry, fish, eggs, 
and dairy. However, red meat will be limited to once per 
week, poultry will be limited to ≤3 times per week and 
fish will be recommended two to three times per week. 
Both diets will derive approximately 25–30 % of energy 
from fat, 15–120 % from protein and the remainder 
from (primarily complex) carbohydrate. The vegetarian 
and Mediterranean diets will be calorie-restricted and 
isocaloric, supplying 1400 kcal/day for women and 
1600 kcal/day for men with a weight <90 kg at baseline 
and 1600 kcal/day for women and 1800 kcal/day for 
men with a weight >90 kg at baseline. No meals or sup- 
plements will be provided. Participants will prepare their 
meals or eat at restaurants. For both diets, alcoholic bev- 
erages are limited to one per day for women and two 
per day for men. Participants will be asked not to alter 
their exercise habits during the study. 
Standardized baseline assessment for both groups will 
include a questionnaire regarding demographic informa- 
tion, risk factors and co-morbidities. Moreover, at the 
baseline visit, participants will be educated about the 
aims and methods of the clinical trial. The subjects who 
agree to participate in the study, after signing the in- 
formed consent, will be included and randomly divided 
into two groups, each assigned to consume first either 
the vegetarian or Mediterranean diet. Each participant, 
before starting, needs to complete a 3-day dietary record 
(two weekdays and one weekend day). A dietician will 
analyse all the 3-day dietary records using a country- 
specific food nutrient database. 
The study procedures are depicted in Fig. 1. There will 
be five clinical evaluations of the study population: one 
before the dietary intervention (Time 0), one 1.5 month 
after the start of the first dietary intervention (Time 1), 
one 3 months after the start of the first dietary interven- 
tion and at the time of intersection between the two 
groups (Time 2), one 4.5 months after the start of the 
study and 1.5 month from the intersection (Time 3), and 
the last one 6 months after the start of the study and 
3 months from the intersection (Time 4). This design 
was chosen to ensure that there will be adequate time to 
achieve steady-state levels of lipid, glucometabolic, in- 
flammatory and oxidative stress parameters. 
Compliance with the intervention is critical to the suc- 
cess of this project and will be achieved using behaviour 
change strategies including self-monitoring and regular 
phone calls for dietary counselling. Furthermore, a diet- 
ician will provide the participants with a detailed 1-week 
menu plan for each dietary period, with all food ingredi- 
ents expressed in weight and/or volume measures, and a 
handout containing details on their assigned diet, includ- 
ing food groups that can be included and ones that 
should be avoided. The vegetarian menu plan will also 
include recipes for preparing meals. Sessions for the two 
groups are similar in duration and content, except with 
regard to dietary details, and group leaders will be 
instructed to make no comment favouring one diet over 
the other or indicating their own dietary habits. 
Participants may discontinue the intervention or with- 
draw from the study for the following reasons: (1) at the 
request of the participant or (2) if the investigator con- 
siders that a participant’s health will be compromised 
due to adverse events or concomitant illnesses that de- 
velop after entering the study. 
Outcomes 
Primary outcome 
The primary outcome is total weight change from 
baseline. 



Secondary outcomes 
The secondary outcomes are: 
(cid:1) Fat mass change from baseline 
(cid:1) Body mass index (BMI) change from baseline 
(cid:1) Lipid profile change from baseline (total cholesterol, 
LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides) 


(cid:1) Inflammatory parameters’ change from baseline [hs- 
CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), circulating 
levels of inflammatory cytokines: IL-1ra (interleukin- 
1ra), IL-1β (interleukin-1 beta), IL-2 (interleukin-2), 
IL-4 (interleukin-4), IL-6 (interleukin-6), IL-8 (inter- 
leukin-8), IL-10 (interleukin-10), IL-12 (interleukin- 
12), IL-17 (interleukin-17), IL-18 (interleukin-18), 
TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor alpha), IFN-γ (inter- 
feron gamma), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth 
factor), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 
1), IP-10 (IFN-γ-inducible protein 10)] 
(cid:1) Oxidative stress markers’ change from baseline (total 
antioxidant profile, parameters of lipid peroxidation) 
Sample size 
The sample size was determined on the basis of previous 
studies conducted to test the efficacy of a vegetarian diet 
on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [12]. To achieve 
an effect size between 1.25 and 2.1 for a power of 80 % at 
alpha < 0.05, for two groups, with a mean difference be- 
tween groups from 2 to 3.5 kg and a standard deviation 
between 1.6 and 3.9, a sample size of at least 50 in each 
group of the study was required. It is projected that 100 
subjects will be required in the final database and 10– 
25 % more must be randomized to achieve this number of 
completed subjects. These projections will be reviewed 
throughout 
the study. Losses will be 
included in the intention-to-treat but not in the per- 
protocol analyses. The sample size calculation was per- 
formed using an online calculator software (available at 
http://www.powerandsamplesize.com). 

Recruitment and randomization 
Male and female participants will be recruited by trial 
personnel using advertisements in local media, newspa- 
pers, social media, sheets and official websites. They will 
also recruit from a pre-existing database of participants 
and from friends or relatives of the hospital and univer- 
sity staff. 
After approval and completion of the initial assess- 
ment, subjects will be formally entered into the study 
and randomized with a 1:1 randomization to study arms 
by a statistician, using a web-based online randomization 
procedure. Randomization will be stratified by age. The 
allocation concealment will be ensured using a central- 
ized service, and it will not be possible for the investiga- 
tors to know the allocation sequence in advance. 


Blinding 
In this trial, blinding of participants and dieticians is not 
possible because of obvious differences between the 
intervention diets; however, outcome measures in the 
present study cannot be easily influenced by the obser- 
ver. In addition, trial personnel who will enrol partici- 
pants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be 
blinded to treatment allocation, and an employee outside 
of the research team will enter data into the computer 
in separate datasheets. On the other hand, making the 
trial open rather than blinded may improve recruitment. 
Data collection 
Follow-up assessments and data collection will be under- 
taken at the Unit of Clinical Nutrition of the Careggi 
University Hospital, Florence, Italy, by trial personnel. 
subjects will be examined between 6.30 and 
All 
9.30 a.m. after a 12-h fasting period. 
Adherence and acceptability 
In order to assess diet compliance, participants will be 
contacted at least twice during the study period. A diet- 
ician will make unannounced telephone calls to each 
participant to administer a 24-h diet recall. Adherence 
to the vegetarian diet will be measured as the absence of 
meat and fish from the dietary recalls. Participants in 
the Mediterranean group will be considered adherent if 
their food records report a great adherence (≥10 points 
on the 9-item literature-based Adherence Score Tool) to 
the Mediterranean diet. 
At Time 2 and Time 4 participants will complete a 
modified version of the Food Acceptability Question- 
naire asking participants to answer questions regarding 
the feasibility, the acceptability and the satisfaction/dis- 
satisfaction with both diets. This questionnaire also asks 
respondents to indicate whether they have frequently ex- 
perienced any of the following perceived benefits or ad- 
verse effects during the intervention period: changes in 
digestion and gastrointestinal function, increased or de- 
creased energy, better or worse sleep than usual and 
self-perceived quality of life. 
Anthropometric measurements and body composition 
Weight and height will be measured using a stadiometer. 
Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as weight 
(kg)/height (m)2. The body composition will be deter- 
mined with a bioelectrical Body Composition Analyzer 
device (Tanita, model TBF-410) at baseline and follow- 
up visits. 
Blood samples 
Blood samples will be collected at the beginning and at 
the end of each intervention phase. Blood samples will be 
centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes, aliquoted to yield 
serum, and then stored at –80 °C until analysis. The fol- 
lowing biochemical measurements will be evaluated: 
complete blood count, lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL 
cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), glucose profile 
(fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c), liver function tests (as- 
partate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, gamma- 
glutamyl transferase, alkaline phosphatase), renal function 
tests (serum creatinine, urea, uric acid), mineral profile 
(sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium), iron metabol- 
ism (iron, ferritin), vitamin profile (vitamin B12, folic acid), 
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory profile [hs-CRP 
(high-sensitivity C-reactive protein), circulating levels of 
inflammatory cytokines: IL-1ra (interleukin-1ra), IL-1β 
(interleukin-1 beta), IL-2 (interleukin-2), IL-4 (interleukin- 
4), IL-6 (interleukin-6), IL-8 (interleukin-8), IL-10 (inter- 
leukin-10), IL-12 (interleukin-12), IL-17 (interleukin-17), 
IL-18 (interleukin-18), TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor 
alpha), IFN-γ (interferon-gamma), VEGF (vascular endo- 
thelial growth factor), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant 
protein-1), IP-10 (IFN-γ-inducible protein 10)], as well as 
antioxidant profile (total antioxidant profile, parameters of 
lipid peroxidation) and parameters related to vascular 
endothelial function such as circulating endothelial pro- 
genitor and circulating endothelial cell count. 
Stool samples 
Stool samples (four or five scoops totalling 4 g) will be 
collected before and after each intervention phase. Stool 
sample collection kits, including containers, will be pro- 
vided for the participants. It is optional for the partici- 
pants to provide the stool samples, so they can continue 
participating in the study even if they choose not to pro- 
vide stool samples. 
Data management 
Data will be collected in an electronic database. Identifi- 
able data will not be recorded in the database or other 
documents, and participants will be identified by a 
unique trial ID only. Hard copies of data sheets linking 
the participant identification number to the person’s 
contact details will be kept securely in a locked filing 
cabinet in a locked office, accessible only to key research 
team members. Participant files and other source data 
(including copies of protocols, questionnaires, original 
reports of test results, correspondence, records of in- 
formed consent and other documents pertaining to the 
conduct of the study) will be kept for the maximum 
period of time permitted by the institution. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS soft- 
ware for Macintosh (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Out- 
comes will be analysed by intention-to-treat and on- 
treatment procedures. Histograms and box plots will be 


used to assess the distributional assumptions and to 
check for possible outliers. Log transformations will be 
applied, where appropriate, in order to render the out- 
come distributions closer to the normal. Bootstrap tech- 
niques will be used if this does not achieve reasonable 
normality to the extent that it may influence the proper- 
ties of the regression analysis. Continuous variables that 
follow an approximately normal distribution will be 
summarized using the mean and standard deviations. 
Categorical variables will be presented in terms of fre- 
quencies and percentages. Before starting the data ana- 
the 
the level, pattern and likely causes of 
lysis, 
missingness in the baseline variables and outcomes will 
be investigated by forming appropriate tables. This infor- 
mation will be used to determine whether the level and 
type of missing data has the potential to introduce bias 
into the analysis results or substantially reduce the preci- 
sion of estimates for the proposed statistical methods. 
All data will be treated as paired samples from a cross- 
over study. The two interventions will be analysed by 
taking into account both periods in the two groups of 
subjects at different stages. The primary outcome, total 
weight change from baseline, will be analysed within 
each group using paired comparison t 
tests to test 
whether the changes from baseline to 3 months, from 
baseline to 6 months and from 3 to 6 months will be 
statistically significant. The absolute change (mean value 
at baseline subtracted from the mean value after inter- 
vention for each subject) will be estimated with inde- 
pendent t sample tests. One-way analysis of variance will 
be used for testing differences between changes in the 
vegetarian and Mediterranean intervention diet groups. 
A linear regression analysis (after checking regression 
assumptions), adjusting for age, gender, smoking habits 
and sedentary lifestyle, will be performed in order to 
compare the effect of the two different treatments. Data 
for the general linear model for repeated measurements 
will be reported as geometric means with their standard 
errors. A significant effect will indicate that the change 
from baseline to the vegetarian diet phase will be differ- 
ent from the change from baseline to the Mediterranean 
diet phase. Secondary outcome variables will be analysed 
similarly. 
Multiple strategies will be employed to reduce attri- 
tion, including an accurate recruitment, a structured and 
time-limited protocol, the inclusion of a run-in period, 
the limitation of the burden and inconvenience of data 
collection on the participants and the development of a 
trusting and collaborative relationship between research 
units and participants. If participants do not attend a 
scheduled appointment, a maximum of three telephone 
calls will be made and one email sent prior to withdraw- 
ing the participant from the study. If a participant wishes 
to withdraw from the study intervention, the reason for 
withdrawal will be documented in the participant re- 
cords for the subsequent analysis in the interpretation of 
the results. 
Sensitivity analyses will be undertaken, based on the 
assumption that missing outcomes are the worst pos- 
sible, or the best possible, 
in different randomization 
groups. If these show that conclusions may differ based 
on missing values, then supplementary multiple imput- 
ation for missing values will be undertaken. These ana- 
lyses will account for results of any losses to follow-up 
insofar as they pertain to differences in measured vari- 
ables (i.e. under the assumption of missing at random). 
For questionnaire items related to acceptability, differ- 
ences between responses during the vegetarian and 
Mediterranean diet phases will be tested using the Wil- 
coxon matched-pairs signed ranks test. The independent 
samples Mann-Whitney U test will be used to compare 
the diet groups. To test for differences in reported bene- 
fits and adverse effects of the diets, the chi-square test 
for independent samples will compare the two diet 
groups regarding frequency of changes in reported 
symptoms from baseline to final 
time points, and 
paired-comparison t 
tests will assess within-group 
changes over time. A P value < 0.05 will be considered 
statistically significant. 
Monitoring 
Given the limited objectives and its short-term nature, 
this trial will be monitored by the protocol team and the 
local Institutional Review Board, without the use of a 
formal data monitoring committee. Data access will be 
restricted to trained staff with unique password- 
protected accounts. Adverse events such as unfavourable 
and unintended signs, abnormal 
laboratory findings, 
symptoms or diseases temporally associated with the 
intervention diet will be collected from the time of 
randomization until the final 6-month follow-up visit for 
each participant, whether or not considered related to 
the intervention study. All adverse events will be 
followed up until they are resolved. 
Ethics and dissemination 
The study will be conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the Data Protection Act. 
Trial personnel will obtain informed consent from all 
participants prior to inclusion (see Additional file 3). All 
patients must agree to participate voluntarily and will be 
free to withdraw from the study at any time. 
The study has received ethical approval by the Tus- 
cany Regional Ethics Committee (REC) of the University 
Hospital of Careggi under the number SPE 15.054. REC 
approval included the trial protocol, information sheet 
and consent form, questionnaires, interviews, any other 
written information that will be provided to the 


participants and any advertisements that will be used 
during the study. The trial is registered at the clinical 
trial registration (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02641834, date 
of registration: 29 December 2015) in accordance with 
the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) requirements. 
Any amendments to the protocol and information pro- 
vided to participants will be submitted to the REC for ap- 
proval prior to implementation. Substantial amendments 
may only be implemented after written REC approval has 
been obtained, whereas non-substantial amendments can 
be implemented without written approval from the REC. 
The Chief Investigator will have to ensure that the partici- 
pant’s privacy is maintained. Data and source documents 
will be stored in such a way that they can be accessed at a 
later date for the purposes of monitoring or inspection by 
the REC. At the end of the study, participants will be able 
to request a copy of the results of the study from the Chief 
Investigator. 
The results from the trial will be submitted for publi- 
cation in a peer-reviewed journal irrespective of the out- 
come. The final report will follow the CONSORT 2010 
guidelines. Authorship of presentations and reports re- 
lated to the study will be in the name of the collabora- 
tive group. 
Discussion 
Because of the growing evidence in favour of the link be- 
tween red and processed meat and cardiovascular dis- 
ease risk [13], cancer [14], diabetes [15] and overall 
mortality [16], the interest in vegetarian diets has in- 
creased. Over the last few years, the number of subjects 
who began to adopt a plant-based dietary pattern has in- 
creased with respect to the past, when the population of 
vegetarians was limited to only a few and selected co- 
horts [17]. This increase has been mainly attributed to 
ethical and environmental motivations, as well as to 
health-related concerns [18]. 
There are several beneficial nutrients that are abun- 
dant in Mediterranean and vegetarian diets, such as 
monounsaturated fatty acids and high amounts of fiber 
and antioxidants; both diets also feature a low intake of 
total and saturated fats. However, to date, no studies are 
available that evaluate the effect of both diets in the 
same group of subjects at different time points. The 
comparison between vegetarian and Mediterranean diet- 
ary patterns in terms of cardiovascular risk prevention 
will be of paramount clinical significance for the general 
population and will help to improve understanding of 
the possible metabolic mechanisms underlying the 
health benefits associated with the adherence to either 
diet on ameliorating the cardiovascular risk profile of 
clinically healthy subjects. 
Trial status 
At the time of manuscript submission, the enrolment of 
clinically healthy subjects is ongoing.
