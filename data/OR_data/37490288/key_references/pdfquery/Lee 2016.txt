Several intervention studies have suggested that vegetarian or vegan diets have clinical 
benefits, particularly in terms of glycemic control, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); 
however, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted in Asians who more commonly 
depend on plant-based foods, as compared to Western populations. Here, we aimed to 
compare the effect of a vegan diet and conventional diabetic diet on glycemic control 
among Korean individuals. 

Participants diagnosed with T2D were randomly assigned to follow either a vegan diet 
(excluding animal-based food including fish; n = 46) or a conventional diet recommended 
by the Korean Diabetes Association 2011 (n = 47) for 12 weeks. HbA1c levels were mea- 
sured at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and the primary study endpoint was the change in HbA1c lev- 
els over 12 weeks. 

The mean HbA1c levels at weeks 0, 4, and 12 were 7.7%, 7.2%, and 7.1% in the vegan 
group, and 7.4%, 7.2%, and 7.2% in the conventional group, respectively. Although both 
groups showed significant reductions in HbA1C levels, the reductions were larger in the 
vegan group than in the conventional group (-0.5% vs. -0.2%; p-for-interaction = 0.017). 
When only considering participants with high compliance, the difference in HbA1c level

reduction between the groups was found to be larger (-0.9% vs. -0.3%). The beneficial 
effect of vegan diets was noted even after adjusting for changes in total energy intake or 
waist circumference over the 12 weeks. 


Both diets led to reductions in HbA1c levels; however, glycemic control was better with the 
vegan diet than with the conventional diet. Thus, the dietary guidelines for patients with T2D 
should include a vegan diet for the better management and treatment. However, further 
studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of a vegan diet, and to identify potential 
explanations of the underlying mechanisms. 



A healthy diet is one of the core elements in the management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), along 
with regular exercise and pharmacotherapy [1]. In fact, diet plays important roles in T2D pre- 
vention and management, such as decreasing the risk of diabetes in individuals with obesity 
and pre-diabetes and avoiding the associated complications [2]; however, there is currently no 
general optimal meal plan or dietary pattern for T2D patients [3]. 
A vegetarian or vegan diet has been suggested to be clinically beneficial in the management 
of diabetes [4, 5]. Interestingly, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) has suggested that a low-fat 
vegan diet can be more effective in glycemic and lipid control than a conventional diet recom- 
mended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) [6]. 

ulations from Western countries [5]. Compared to the populations from Western countries, 
Asians mainly consume a diet based on plant foods such as rice, vegetables, and fresh fruits [7]. 
Hence, the use of a vegan diet in Asians with T2D may be more effective than that in Western 
populations. 

exposure to chemicals such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may disturb glucose and 
lipid metabolism [8]. As fatty animal foods, including fish, are the main sources of exposure to 
POPs [9], the use of a vegan diet that excludes any animal foods could also be beneficial in 
terms of avoiding POP exposure. 




Participants were recruited through advertisements in the endocrinology outpatient clinic of 
Kyungpook National University Hospital, Hypertension-Diabetes Education Center, and 4 
public health centers in Daegu city from March 2012 through August 2012. The inclusion crite- 
ria were as follows: age of 30–70 years; use of hypoglycemic medications for (cid:1)6 months; and 
HbA1c level of 6.0–11.0%. The exclusion criteria were as follows: increased dose of 



hypoglycemic medication or the addition of a new drug in the regimen during the last 2 
months; current vegetarian status; pregnancy; or severe complications such as chronic renal 
failure. 

Considering the two-sample t-test for a between-group HbA1c difference (effect size) of 0.65%, 
standard deviation of 1.0, α level of 0.05 for a two-tailed test, power of 80%, and a loss of fol- 
low-up rate of 30%, we found that 53 participants would be required for each group [10]. 
Among the 106 participants enrolled from April 2012 through August 2012, 53 subjects and 53 
subjects were stratified according to a cutoff HbA1c value of 8.0% and randomly allocated to 
the conventional Korean Diabetic Association (KDA) diet group and vegan diet group, respec- 
tively, using stratified block randomization with a block size of 4. 

1) Experimental group: vegan diet. Participants were asked to follow a vegan diet consist- 
ing of whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and legumes. The following instructions were provided to 
these patients: 1) ingest unpolished rice (brown rice); 2) avoid polished rice (white rice); 3) 
avoid processed food made of rice flour or wheat flour; 4) avoid all animal food products (i.e., 
meat, poultry, fish, daily goods, and eggs); and 5) favor low-glycemic index foods (e.g., legumes, 
legumes-based foods, green vegetables, and seaweed). Participants were carefully educated on 
the foods they should consume and should avoid. The amount and frequency of food con- 
sumption, energy intake, and portion sizes were not restricted over the 12-week period. 

lines for diabetes recommended by the KDA 2011 [11]. Participants were asked to 1) restrict 
their individualized daily energy intake based on body weight, physical activity, need for weight 
control, and compliance; 2) total calorie intake comprised 50–60% carbohydrate, 15–20% pro- 
tein (if renal function is normal), <25% fat, <7% saturated fat, minimal trans-fat intake, and 
(cid:3)200 mg/day cholesterol. A dietitian estimated the individual daily energy requirement (stan- 
dard body weight [kg] × 30–35 [kcal/kg]) while considering moderate physical activity in the 
participants, and established the food exchange lists based on the individual daily energy 
requirements as per the KDA 2011 guidelines. The type and amount of food were classified 
into 6 food categories (grains, meat, vegetables, fats and oils, milk, and fruits) based on the 
food exchange lists, and were prescribed to all participants in the KDA group. The daily energy 
requirement and daily proportion of food categories were appropriately distributed into 3 
meals and snacks consumed between meals; the participants’ food preferences were considered. 
The adjustment of daily energy requirement based on weight loss during the study period was 
not performed. 
3) Common protocols for both groups. We conducted an open randomized clinical trial 
without the blinding of participants in terms of the nature of their dietary intervention. No spe- 
cific meals or menus were given to the participants, and they were free to consume any food 
based on the recommendations provided. One registered dietitian provided nutritional educa- 
tion and instruction for 1 hour at week 0 and week 4, which helped participants make appro- 
priately assigned diet plans using educational materials. The food consumption status of each 
participant was checked once a week by a dietitian via a telephone consultation. The dietitian 
reminded patients about the dietary guidelines and cooking methods that were previously 
described during dietary education, provided counseling to participants and answered ques- 
tions, and encouraged the patients to record daily food consumption. The duration of educa- 
tion was similar for both groups. No additional functional foods or vitamin supplements 



including vitamin B12 were permitted. The participants were asked to maintain the usual level 
of physical activity, and to not modify their exercise habits during the intervention period. 
Participants were asked to maintain their current medication, without any control of the 
dose or type of medication for 12 weeks; however, dose reduction was permitted when it was 
necessary according to a physician’s judgment. The glucose levels were measured as a part of 
blood sampling at baseline, and during the fourth and twelfth week; most participants self- 
assessed their blood glucose levels via finger-stick glucose measurement. The study protocol 
was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of Kyungpook National Univer- 
sity Hospital (IRB No: KNUH 2012-03-032). Written informed consent was obtained from all 
the subjects before they were enrolled in the study. All participants received a financial incen- 
tive (approximately US$ 125). This study was registered with the Clinical Research Informa- 
tion Service (CRiS, Korea, https://cris.nih.go.kr; registration number: KCT0001771). 

A dietitian conducted 24-hour dietary recalls through unannounced telephone calls a total of 
12 times (4 times per month, including 3 on weekdays and once on a weekend). The dietary 
intake of the subjects prior to participation in the trial was not assessed. Energy and nutrition 
intake was analyzed using a country-specific food-nutrient database (Can-Pro 4.0 professional 
version, the Korean Nutrition Society, Korea, 2011). Physical examination and laboratory mea- 
surements, including body weight, height, waist circumference, and blood pressure, were 
assessed at week 0, 4, and 12. Venous blood was collected in the morning, after fasting from 
8:00 PM on the previous night. The fasting blood glucose level was determined using the hexo- 
kinase method with the ADVIA 2400 analyzer (Siemens, USA). The HbA1c level was deter- 
mined with the turbidimetric inhibition immunoassay using COBAS Integra 800 (Roche, 
Switzerland). The levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride were analyzed using the enzymatic 
assay and the level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was analyzed by using the 
selective inhibition method with the ADVIA 2400 analyzer (Siemens, USA). The level of low- 
density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was estimated using the equation of total cholesterol— 
(triglycerides/5)—HDL cholesterol. 

Each participant was required to fill out a daily dietary record form regarding the types and 
amount of food consumed during the intervention period. Compliance was measured accord- 
ing to a daily 10-point scale via self-assessed dietary recording. In the vegan diet group, the die- 
titian deducted 1 point whenever the consumption of meats, poultry, fish, daily goods, or eggs 
was entered into the daily dietary record. In the KDA diet group, the dietitian checked the 
types and amount of food recorded in the daily food diary and deducted 1 point whenever 
daily food consumption had not been maintained according to the prescribed food exchange 
lists. We used the average value of the daily compliance score over 0 to 12 weeks, 0 to 4 weeks, 
and 5 to 12 weeks. 

The primary endpoint was the HbA1c level. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (RM-A- 
NOVA) was used to evaluate 1) whether there was a difference in HbA1c levels between the 
baseline and endpoint in both groups and 2) whether the effect of dietary intervention was dif- 
ferent over time, including the interaction of the time and diet group (time(cid:4)diet group). The 
secondary endpoints were body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, systolic/diastolic 
blood pressure (SBP/DBP), fasting blood glucose, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and 



triglyceride. For intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, we imputed the missing HbA1c levels at the 
fourth and twelfth weeks by using the HbA1c level at baseline by the last-observation-carried- 
forward imputation method. The number of missing data points were total 26 points on 13 
withdrawal participants. Moreover, the clinical and dietary information required for adjust- 
ment were also imputed with the median value of each variable among the 93 subjects with 
complete data. All analyses were calculated using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). A p- 
value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 


Among the 106 randomized participants, 6 in the conventional KDA diet group and 7 in the 
vegan diet group dropped out of the study; hence, a total of 47 and 46 participants finally com- 
pleted the 12-week intervention in the conventional KDA diet group and vegan diet group, 
respectively. All 13 drop-out subjects did not receive any education and did not participate in 
the 4-week and 12-week follow-up evaluation. Fig 1 depicts the inclusion and exclusion of the 
participants in the study. 
When comparing the demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline between the 2 
groups, none of the variables were found to be significantly different (Table 1). Moreover, none 
of the participants changed their medication dose over the 12 weeks. 

The average energy intake over the 12 weeks was 1,496 kcal/day in the vegan diet group and 
1,559 kcal/day in the conventional diet group, and the difference was significant (p = 0.042; 
Table 2). The intake of nutrients primarily from plant-based foods (carbohydrates, vegetable 
fat, fiber, beta-carotene, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin B6, folate, phosphorus, and 
potassium) was significantly higher in the vegan diet group than in the conventional diet 
group. The intake of nutrients primarily from animal-based foods (animal fat, protein, choles- 
terol, total fatty acid, saturated fatty acid, mono-unsaturated fatty acid, vitamin D, vitamin 
B12, and iron) were significantly higher in the conventional diet group than in the vegan diet 
group. The nutrient intakes at week 1, week 4, and week 12 are described in S1 Table. 
Compliance based on the self-assessed daily records 
Compliance—evaluated based on the self-assessed dietary record—was better in the conven- 
tional diet group than in the vegan diet group (Table 2). The mean compliance score (a maxi- 
mum of 10 points) during the overall intervention period was 9.2±1.6 and 8.2±1.5 in the 
conventional diet group and vegan diet group, respectively (p = 0.002). Compared to the early 
phase of the trial (first to fourth week), the compliance was lower during the late phase of the 
trial (fifth to twelfth week) in both groups. The proportion of participants with high compli- 
ance ((cid:1)9 points) was significantly higher in the conventional diet group (78.7%) than in the 
vegan group (30.4%) (p<0.001). 

The HbA1c level significantly decreased over time in both groups: -0.5% in the vegan diet 
group (p<0.01) and -0.2% in the conventional diet group (p<0.05) (Table 3, Fig 2A). However, 
the changes in the HbA1c level from baseline to the end point were greater in the vegan diet 
group than in the conventional diet group (p-for-interaction for time(cid:4)group interac- 
tion = 0.017). When analyses were restricted to subjects with a high compliance ((cid:1)9 points/10 





points), the difference in HbA1c level changes between the 2 groups became more remarkable: 
-0.9% in the vegan group and -0.3% in the conventional group (p-for-interaction for time- 
(cid:4)group interaction = 0.010) (Table 3, Fig 2B). The differences remained significant even after 
adjusting for energy intake or waist circumference. The results of the ITT analysis were similar 
to those of subjects with complete data (S2 Table). 
Secondary endpoint: BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure, and lipid 
control 
The BMI and waist circumference significantly reduced over the 12-week period only in the 
vegan diet group (p-for-interaction for time(cid:4)group interaction = 0.027 for waist circumfer- 
ence). However, there were no significant differences in the changes in SBP, DBP, LDL-

to increase in the vegan diet group and tended to decrease in the conventional diet group (p- 
for-interaction for time(cid:4)group interaction = 0.053). When the analyses were restricted to sub- 
jects with a high compliance ((cid:1)9 points/10 points), the results remained unchanged (data not 
shown). 

In the present study, we observed that both vegan and conventional diabetic diets were signifi- 
cantly associated with reductions in HbA1c levels. However, compared to the conventional 
diet, the vegan diet appeared to be more effective for glycemic control among T2D patients. In 
particular, the vegan diet group with a high compliance showed a markedly decreasing trend in 
the HbA1c level.

glycemic control in T2D patients with various diet interventions, including a vegan or vegetar- 
ian diet [12]. However, the current study suggests that a vegan diet may have additional bene- 
fits, other than the low energy intake or weight loss. 

trolled clinical trials conducted primarily in the United States showed that a vegetarian or 
vegan diet has a significant glycemic control effect in the management of T2D [5]. In the 
pooled analysis, vegetarian diets were associated with a significant decrease in HbA1c levels 
(-0.39%), as compared to omnivorous diets. This difference appears to be slightly larger than 
that observed in the overall sample in the present study; in fact, the difference in the changes in 
HbA1C levels between the vegan diet group (-0.5%) and conventional diet group (-0.2%) was 
approximately -0.3%.

These findings appear to fail to support our priori hypothesis that a vegan diet would be 
more effective in T2D management among Asians than among Westerners when the absolute 
value of decreased HbA1c between studies was simply compared. However, when we only 
compared participants with good compliance, we noted that the HbA1C reduction among the 
vegan diet group was 0.9%, and that the difference between the 2 groups was doubled (-0.6%). 
As previous clinical trials did not report results only from participants with good compliance, 
it is still difficult to interpret this finding as direct evidence for the greater effectiveness of a 
vegan diet in T2D management among Asians than among Westerners. 

ance appeared to be larger than the effects of other dietary approaches, which were examined 
in a meta-analysis of 20 RCTs on various T2D diet interventions; the largest effect was 
observed with a Mediterranean diet (effect size, -0.47%) [12]. In RCTs, low compliance can be 
expected with vegan diets as it would be difficult for individuals with a prior omnivorous diet 
to maintain a vegan diet for several months. However, our findings suggest that, if patients are 
motivated to maintain a vegan diet, it can be effective in the management of T2D. 
The practical advantages of vegan diets include the absence of any restriction on calorie 
intake, lack of necessity for calculating food portion sizes, and ease of understanding the diet 
methods (no consumption of animal food) [13]. In particular, compared to conventional dia- 
betic diets that are focused on restricting calorie intake and portion size, vegetarian diets are 
reportedly easier to follow during exercise—another key component of T2D management— 
due to the reduced feeling of hunger [14]. Considering that both diet and exercise are 2 vital 
components for the optimal management of T2D, such advantages would be important for 
T2D patients. 
In addition to improved glycemic control, vegetarian or vegan diets may offer health bene- 
fits associated with cardiovascular risk factors such as serum lipids and blood pressure, as com- 
pared to omnivorous diets [15]. In a meta-analysis on 11 RCTs, vegetarian or vegan diets were 
found to have significant lowering effects on the concentrations of LDL-cholesterol and HDL- 
cholesterol, but no remarkable effect on the concentration of triglycerides [16]. Moreover, in a 
meta-analysis on 7 RCTs, these diets were found to be effective in reducing SBP and DBP, in 
comparison with omnivorous diets [17]. However, we did not observe any benefit on blood 
pressure and lipids in both diets. The effect of a vegan diet on the cardiovascular risk factors 
may be better evaluated among participants with dyslipidemia or hypertension than among 
those with T2D. 

result of lower energy intake, has been considered a main mechanism for improved glycemic 
control with vegan or vegetarian diets [13, 14, 18]. However, the benefit of vegan diets in the 
present study could not be fully explained by weight loss or lower energy intake. Other poten- 
tial mechanisms may include the higher intake of dietary fiber [19]. Dietary fiber can lower the 
glycemic index of carbohydrates by slowing the absorption of glucose from the intestine [20]. 
In addition, dietary fiber can improve glycemic control by increasing bile acid excretion [21], 
and increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids via the bacterial fermentation of fiber 
[22]. The reduction of intramyocellular lipid concentrations may represent another possible 
mechanism [23]. 



Another explanation may involve the reduced exposure to POPs by vegan diets through the 
prohibition of animal food. Recently, background exposure to low-dose POPs has been found 
to be an important risk factor of developing T2D [8]. Furthermore, these chemicals are associ- 
ated with poor glycemic control among T2D patients [24], and with an increased risk of cardio- 
vascular diseases [25, 26], which are the most common complications of T2D. Hence, avoiding 
animal food contaminated with POPs may offer additional benefit for T2D patients. 
There are several limitations of the present study. First, the study duration of 3 months 
would not be sufficient to evaluate the long-term effects of vegan diets on glycemic control. 
However, an RCT with a long duration would commonly involve changes in the medication 
for appropriate medical management, and hence, the estimation of effect size might be compli- 
cated [6]. Hence, a 3-month study duration without any change in medication would be suit- 
able for the evaluation of diet effects among T2D patients. Second, compared to previous trials 
on diet intervention that used a more intensive approach (including weekly or biweekly group 
meetings), this study used only telephone consultations. This may be the reason for the low 
compliance among our study subjects. Third, most of the study participants were women, as 
men were difficult to recruit for diet intervention. In fact, it is known that the participants of 
clinical trials on interventions for diet or behavioral change are predominantly female due to 
the low participation rate of males [27]. Nevertheless, we could not exclude the possibility that 
the effect of vegan diets may differ according to the gender. Fourth, it is unclear whether the 
improvement in glycemic control through vegan diets would lead to a reduction in the risks of 
macro- or microvascular complications of diabetes, as there are certain concerns regarding the 
potential of low intake of some nutrients in a vegan diet that is not planned well [28]. 

The use of a vegan diet for 3 months was found to be more effective for glycemic control 
among T2D patients, as compared to a conventional diabetes diet recommended by the 
KDA. However, as the compliance of the vegan diet group was lower than that of the con- 
ventional group, and because dietary choices are often personal, it is not realistic to recom- 
mend vegan diets to all T2D patients. Nevertheless, this effective diet approach can be 
applied for T2D patients who are strongly motivated to follow a vegan diet, particularly in 
the Asian population.
