Low-Calorie Vegetarian Versus Mediterranean 
Diets for Reducing Body Weight and 
Improving Cardiovascular Risk Profile 
CARDIVEG Study (Cardiovascular Prevention With Vegetarian Diet) 

BACKGROUND: Only a few randomized dietary intervention studies 
that investigated the effects of lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (Vd) in clinically 
healthy omnivorous subjects are available. 
METHODS: We randomly assigned to overweight omnivores with a 
low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile a low-calorie Vd compared 
with a low-calorie Mediterranean diet (MD), each lasting 3 months, with 
a crossover design. The primary outcome was the difference in body 
weight, body mass index, and fat mass changes between the 2 groups. 
Secondary outcomes were differences in circulating cardiovascular disease 
risk parameters changes between the 2 groups. 
RESULTS: One hundred eighteen subjects (mean age: 51.1 years, 
females: 78%) were enrolled. The total participation rate at the end 
of the study was 84.7%. No differences between the 2 diets in body 
weight were observed, as reported by similar and significant reductions 
obtained by both Vd (‒1.88 kg) and MD (‒1.77 kg). Similar results were 
observed for body mass index and fat mass. In contrast, significant 
differences between the 2 interventions were obtained for low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and vitamin B12 levels. The difference 
between the Vd and MD groups, in terms of end-of-diet values, was 
recorded at 9.10 mg/dL for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.01), 
12.70 mg/dL for triglycerides (P<0.01), and 32.32 pg/mL for vitamin B12 
(P<0.01). Finally, no significant difference was found between Vd and 
MD interventions in oxidative stress markers and inflammatory cytokines, 
except for interleukin-17, which improved only in the MD group. Forty-six 
participants during the Vd period and 35 during the MD period reached 
the target values for ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor. 
CONCLUSIONS: Both Vd and MD were effective in reducing body weight, 
body mass index, and fat mass, with no significant differences between 
them. However, Vd was more effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels, whereas MD led to a greater reduction in triglyceride levels.

mon type of vegetarian diet, entails the exclusion 
of meat and fish in their fresh, preserved, and 
processed form; however, it allows for the consump- 
tion of eggs and dairy products.1 In recent years, the 
general population has shown considerable interest in 
the Vd, as demonstrated by the progressive and con- 
stant increase in the number of individuals who began 
to adopt a Vd when the cohorts of vegetarians were 
limited to only selected populations.1 This increase has 
been predominantly attributed to the findings of differ- 
ent case-control2,3 and prospective cohort studies4–6 in 
the last decade that focus on the health aspects of this 
diet. In a recent meta-analysis carried out by our group 
on >130 000 vegetarians, adherence to a Vd was found 
to be associated with many health benefits, ranging 
from lower levels of cardiovascular risk parameters to 
a reduced risk of ischemic heart disease.7 Nevertheless, 
the medical literature in this field puts forth some un- 
resolved questions that require further investigation. 
Most of the findings that pointed to the beneficial ef- 
fects of a Vd were from observational studies or studies 
conducted in countries at a high risk for cardiovascular 
disease (eg, the United States) or on vegetarians. This 
approach allowed for the possibility of bias related to 
the fact that such populations are possibly more health- 
conscious and thus not completely representative of the 
general population.8 Moreover, few and limited ran- 
domized dietary intervention studies have investigated 
the effects of a Vd in clinically healthy omnivorous par- 
ticipants.9–12 Our aim was to compare, in a population 
of omnivorous individuals living in a low-risk (for car- 
diovascular disease) European country, the effects of a 
3-month period on a low-calorie Vd compared with a 
low-calorie Mediterranean diet (MD) on several mark- 
ers of cardiovascular disease risk. The MD is widely re- 
ported as one of the healthiest models for preventing 
cardiovascular disease.13 
METHODS 
Study Design 
The study protocol was previously described14 and is briefly 
reported here. Clinically healthy participants (18–75 years of 
age) with a low-to-moderate cardiovascular risk profile (<5% 
at 10 years according to the European Society of Cardiology)15 
were recruited through advertisements in local media, news- 
papers, social media, official web pages, and websites from 
the Clinical Nutrition Unit of Careggi University Hospital, 
Florence, Italy, from March 2014 to June 2015. Eligibility cri- 
teria included being overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥25 
kg/m2) and the simultaneous presence of ≥1 of the following 
criteria defined by the guidelines for cardiovascular disease 
prevention of the European Society of Cardiology:15 total 
cholesterol levels >190 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol levels >115 mg/dL, triglyceride levels >150 mg/dL, 
and glucose levels >110 but <126 mg/dL.15 Participants were 
excluded if they were taking medications for any reason, had 
a serious illness or an unstable condition, were pregnant or 
nursing, were participating or had participated in a weight 
loss treatment program in the last 6 months, or were follow- 
ing or had followed a food profile that, to a certain extent, 
excluded meat, poultry, or fish in the last 6 months. 
The study was a randomized, open, crossover dietary trial 
with 2 intervention periods, each lasting 3 months.14 After a 
2-week run-in period, which was used to assess participants’ 
motivation, commitment, and availability, participants were 
randomly assigned to a Vd (n=60) or an MD (n=58) group. 
During the run-in period, participants were asked to complete 
a 3-day (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) dietary record. After 
the first phase of intervention, participants crossed over to 
the other dietary treatment. During the study, 5 clinical evalu- 
ations were performed: at the baseline before the start of 
treatment, 1.5 months after the start of the first dietary inter- 
vention, 3 months after the start of the first dietary interven- 
tion and at the time of crossing over, 4.5 months from the 
start of the study and 1.5 months from the time of crossing 
over, and finally, 6 months after the start of the study and 
3 months from the time of crossing over. Participants were 
instructed not to alter their lifestyle and exercise habits during 
the study, and no weight loss goal was given. Before enroll- 
ment, written informed consent was obtained from each par- 
ticipant. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (SPE 
15.054) of the Tuscany Region, Careggi University Hospital, 





• To date, this randomized controlled trial is the first 
study assessing the effects of a lacto-ovo vegetar- 
ian diet (Vd) compared with a Mediterranean diet 
(MD) in the same cohort of omnivorous subjects liv- 
ing in a low-risk country for cardiovascular disease. 
• After 3 months of dietary intervention, both Vd 
and MD were effective in reducing body weight, 
body mass index, and fat mass, with no significant 
differences between them. 
• The Vd significantly reduced low-density lipopro- 
tein cholesterol, vitamin B12, and uric acid levels, 
whereas only the MD showed the potential to 
improve triglycerides and interleukin-17 levels. 

• Our findings suggest that in the context of behav- 
ioral counseling that promotes a reduced caloric 
intake, Vd and MD determine similar reduction in 
body weight and fat mass. 
• The present results suggest that following a Vd 
leads to a significant reduction in low-density lipo- 
protein cholesterol, whereas the MD could be more 
effective in reducing triglyceride levels. 
• This work could improve the awareness of the gen- 
eral population that both Vd and MD may help in 
reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Declaration of Helsinki and the Data Protection Act. 
Intervention 
Interventions were delivered through face-to-face, indi- 
vidual counseling sessions at the Clinical Nutrition Unit of 
Careggi University Hospital. Participants were provided with 
a detailed, 1-week menu plan as well as tips and informa- 
tion on the food groups that could be included and those 
that could not. Both of the diets were low-calorie in nature 
and acted as dietary interventions to reduce body weight or 
the risk parameters for cardiovascular disease. The Vd plan 
included recipes for preparing meals. Both diets were hypo- 
caloric with respect to the energy requirements of the partici- 
pants, but completely isocaloric between them, and consisted 
of ≈50% to 55% of energy from carbohydrate, 25% to 30% 
from total fat (≤7% of energy from saturated fat, <200 mg/d 
of cholesterol), and 15% to 20% from protein. The Vd was 
characterized by abstinence from the consumption of meat 
and meat products, poultry, fish, and seafood, and the flesh 
of any other animal. It included eggs and dairy products, as 
well as all the other food groups. The MD was characterized 
by the consumption of all the food groups, including meat 
and meat products, poultry, and fish. The dietary profiles, in 
terms of servings per week, calculated on the basis of the 
portion sizes recommended by the Italian Recommended 
Dietary Allowances,16 are shown in Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement. There were no substantial differences in 
the frequency of servings per week for cereals, fruits and veg- 
etables, potatoes, sweets, and olive oil. As expected, in the 
case of Vd, a higher frequency of consumption, per week, 
of legumes (5 versus 2.5 servings), nuts (2 versus 1), eggs (2 
versus 1), and dairy products (21.5 versus 18.5) was reported 
compared to MD. 
Data Collection 
Data-collection and follow-up measurements were performed 
at the Clinical Nutrition Unit of Careggi University Hospital. All 
the participants were examined between 6:30 am and 9:30 am 
after an overnight fast. Participants were asked not to under- 
take strenuous physical activity on the day before the exami- 
nation. The baseline assessment for both groups included a 
questionnaire on demographic information, risk factors, and 
comorbidities. All participants were asked to report the fre- 
quency (times per week), duration (months), and intensity of 
recreational and physical activities performed during the pre- 
ceding year. 
A physical activity grade was derived for each participant 
based on frequency, type, and duration of the physical activ- 
ity and described in terms such as absent or light (ie, inactive 
or either occasional walking or recreational activity only) and 
moderate (ie, frequent recreational activity, regular walking 
for 30 minutes 3–5 times per week, or sporting exercise at 
least once a week). The grade was not a measure of the total 
time spent in physical activity; it was a relative qualitative 
measure of how much physical activity was undertaken. 
In addition, before the start of the intervention, each par- 
ticipant completed a 3-day (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) 
dietary record analyzed using a nutrition-specific database. 
Body weight and body composition were measured at each 
clinical evaluation. Weight and height were measured using 
a stadiometer. BMI was calculated as the weight (kg)/height 
(m2). Participants were classified as overweight if their BMI 
was ≥25 kg/m2 but <30 kg/m2 and obese if their BMI was ≥30 
kg/m2. Body composition was determined by a bioelectrical 
impedance analysis device (TANITA, model TBF-410). 
Compliance 
Compliance to the Vd was evaluated through unannounced 
telephone calls, during which a 24-hour diet recall inter- 
view was conducted, and through a modified version of the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey food ques- 
tionnaire, with the aim of confirming the total absence of any 
animal flesh in the diet.17 Adherence to the Vd was defined as 
the absence of the consumption of any animal flesh, reported 
through both a 24-hour diet recall and a food frequency 
questionnaire. Compliance to the MD was evaluated at base- 
line and during follow-up visits using the MD adherence score 
recently released and validated by our group.18 Participants in 
the MD group were considered adherent if they reported ≥10 
points in a scale ranging from 0 to 18. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcomes were differences in changes in total 
body weight, BMI, and fat mass from the baseline, whereas 
the secondary outcomes were differences in changes in all the 
circulating cardiovascular risk parameters from baseline (lipid 
profile, glycemic profile, oxidative stress profile, and inflam- 
matory profile). 
Laboratory Measurements 
Venous blood samples were collected at baseline and the 
end of each intervention phase in evacuated plastic tubes 
(Vacutainer, Becton Dickinson). Samples were centrifuged 
at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes (4°C) and stored in aliquots at 
80°C until further analyses. Total cholesterol and its subtypes, 
triglycerides, glucose, insulin, serum electrolytes, standard 
liver panel enzymes, and mineral and vitamin profiles were 
measured according to conventional laboratory standard 
methods. To assess the plasma oxidative stress profile, lipid 
peroxidation markers were estimated using the Thiobarbituric 
Acid Reactive Substances assay kit (Oxitek-ZeptoMetrix Corp, 
Buffalo, NY). Plasma total antioxidant capacity, which repre- 
sents the overall antioxidant defense system, was measured 
using the oxygen radical absorbance capacity.19 The produc- 
tion of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes (lymphocytes, 
monocytes, and granulocytes) was measured as previously 
reported.20 Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were deter- 
mined by a Bio-Plex cytokine assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 
Statistical Analysis 
The sample size was determined based on studies previously 
conducted to verify the effectiveness of vegetarian-like diets 
on participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus.14 We estimated 
that the randomization of a population size of 110 to 125 





participants would be required (a sample size of ≥50 in each 
group of the study) to obtain 80% power to detect an effect 
size between 1.25 and 2.1 at an α level of 0.05. This calcula- 
tion was based on conservative estimates of a 10% to 25% 
dropout rate. 
The results were expressed as mean±SD, median and 
range, or geometric mean with 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented in 
terms of frequencies and percentages. All data were treated 
as paired samples from a crossover study. The 2 interventions 
were analyzed combining the results obtained in the 2 phases 
of both groups. The results were analyzed within each group 
using a 2-tailed Student’s t test. Absolute change (mean base- 
line value subtracted from mean value after intervention) was 
estimated by an independent sample t test. The Spearman 
(r) test was used to estimate the correlation between the 
changes in the vitamin B12 and interleukin-6 levels. 
To compare the effect of the 2 different diets, a general 
linear model, adjusted for the order of treatment and weight 
change (for biochemical, oxidative, and inflammatory param- 
eters), was conducted. Because these tests assume normal 
data distribution, nondistributed data were transformed into 
logs, and further analyses were performed with the processed 
data. However, to facilitate interpretation, the log data were 
again converted to the original scale (antilog) and presented 
as geometric means with 95% CIs. 
The possibility of a dietary carryover effect, which is con- 
sidered if the impact of the first treatment is still present when 
the participant enters the second treatment period, was ana- 
lyzed. We evaluated the sequence effect to confirm whether 
the impacts of the Vd and MD were different when the order 
of administration changed. This effect was estimated by com- 
paring the geometric mean change difference between the 
treatments in the Vd and MD groups after adjustment for the 
order of treatment. 
Subgroup analyses were performed to analyze possible 
differences in the changes according to some character- 
istics of the study population, such as age (≤50 years, >50 
years), sex (females, males), categories of BMI (25–29.9 kg/ 
m2, ≥30 kg/m2), obesity status (class I, 30–34.9 kg/m2; class II, 
35–39.9 kg/m2; class III, ≥40 kg/m2), years of education (≤13 
years, >13 years), physical activity (absent or light/moder- 
ate), civil status (married, not married), total cholesterol level 
(≤190 mg/dL, >190 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol level (≤115 mg/ 
dL, >115 mg/dL), triglycerides level (≤150 mg/dL, >150 mg/ 
dL), and glucose level (<110 mg/dL, 110–126 mg/dL). P val- 
ues <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Outcomes 
were analyzed through on-treatment procedures. The statisti- 
cal package PASW 20.0 for Macintosh (SPSS Inc) was used. 
RESULTS 
Participants’ Characteristics 
Figure 1 shows the enrollment of participants in the 
study. A total of 107 participants completed ≥1 phase 
of intervention and were included in the analysis. One 
hundred participants (50 participants for each interven- 
tion) completed the entire study, with a participation 
rate of 84.7% at the conclusion. The baseline demo- 
graphic and clinical characteristics of the population 
studied, according to the first dietary randomization, 
are shown in Table 1. No significant differences in the 
characteristics between the 2 groups, at randomiza- 
tion, were observed. 
Dietary Intake 
Through the analyses of the dietary profile at the end of 
the first intervention phase, we found that the total en- 
ergy, total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol intakes of 
the participants significantly decreased compared with 
baseline (Table II in the online-only Data Supplement). 
However, no significant differences in the proportions 
of decrease were observed between the groups, apart 
from cholesterol intake, which, as expected, decreased 
more in the Vd group (‒105.6 versus ‒49.7 mg/d; 
P=0.001). The protein intake increased in the MD group 
(+1.4%) and decreased in the Vd group (‒1.5%), lead- 
ing to a significant difference between the groups 
(P=0.001). 
Body Weight and Body Composition 
Figure 2 shows the changes in the anthropometric pa- 
rameters at the end of the study after combining data 
from both intervention periods. No significant differ- 
ence between the 2 diets was found because both the 
Vd and MD produced equally effective results, with the 
difference between the Vd and MD groups, in terms 
of end-of-diet values, being recorded at 0.11 kg for 
weight (P=0.95), 0.03 kg/m2 for BMI (P=0.84), and 0.23 
kg for fat mass (P=0.50). With regard to the change 
within each group, a significant body weight reduction 
of ‒1.88 kg (95% CI, ‒2.42 to ‒1.35) and ‒1.77 kg 
(95% CI, ‒2.29 to ‒1.25) with a significant BMI re- 
duction of ‒0.64 kg/m2 (95% CI, ‒0.84 to ‒0.43) and 
‒0.67 kg/m2 (95% CI, ‒0.86 to ‒0.47), and a signifi- 
cant fat mass reduction of ‒1.23 kg (95% CI, ‒1.67 to 
‒0.80) and ‒1.46 kg (95% CI, ‒1.93 to ‒1.01) were 
reported in the Vd and MD groups, respectively. Sub- 
group analyses showed no significant differences in the 
changes of all the anthropometric parameters. 
Biochemical Profile 
The changes in the biochemical parameters, including 
hematologic variables, vitamins, iron status, minerals, 
liver function, uric acid, and lipid and glycemic profiles, 
are shown in Table 2. The diets displayed significant 
differences in terms of end-of-diet values, LDL choles- 
terol (9.10 mg/dL; P=0.01), triglycerides (12.70 mg/dL; 
P<0.01), vitamin B12 (32.32 pg/mL; P<0.01), and uric 
acid levels (0.22 mg/dL; P<0.01). Although the Vd re- 
sulted in a significant decrease (‒5.44%) in LDL cho- 
lesterol levels, no significant change was observed after 





the MD period. The MD resulted in a significant decrease 
(‒5.91%) in triglyceride levels compared with the Vd, 
which showed an increasing trend despite it not being 
significant. For vitamin B12, a significant decrease after 
the Vd (‒5.06%) and a nonsignificant increasing trend 
after the MD were reported. Finally, in the case of the 
Vd, a significant reduction in uric acid levels (‒2.89%) 
was noted; nonsignificant changes were reported dur- 
ing the MD. 
Subgroup analyses showed that changes in the lipid 
profile during the Vd were more evident in men, in par- 
ticipants >50 years of age, in nonsmokers, in partici- 
pants with sedentary lifestyles, and in participants with 
a BMI >30 kg/m2, with the most significant results in 
participants with class I obesity (Table III in the online- 
only Data Supplement). The change in the vitamin B12 
levels after the Vd phase was more apparent among 
overweight participants (especially among participants 
with class I obesity), men, and participants <50 years of 
age (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement). 
Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory 
Profiles 
Changes in the oxidative stress profile are reported in 
Table 3. No difference between the diets was observed. 
Although both diets led to a similar and significant re- 
duction in the Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances 
levels, only the Vd resulted in a significant reduction 
in the leukocyte-derived reactive oxygen species level 
(‒8.42%). Total antioxidant capacity and M- and G- 
derived reactive oxygen species showed decreasing but 
nonsignificant trends. 
With regard to the inflammatory profile, a significant 
difference between the diets was observed in the case 
of interleukin-17 levels (3.39 pg/mL; P<0.01). Indeed, 
interleukin-17 displayed opposite tendencies during the 
2 phases of intervention, as evidenced by an increasing 
trend (by 37.57%) in the Vd phase and a significant 
decreasing trend (by 36.3%) in the MD phase (Table 4). 
Overall, the Vd resulted in a reduction in the levels of 8 
out of 13 cytokines, and in the case of 6, statistical sig- 
nificance was reached. The MD resulted in a reduction 
in the levels of 11 out of 13 pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines, and in the case of 7, statistical significance 
was reached. 


Compliance 
During the study, 18 (15.3%) participants reported 
a less-than-optimal compliance to the prescribed di- 
ets and were excluded at different time points from 
the study (Figure 1). The comparison of baseline 
characteristics between participants who completed 
the study and those who were excluded for not be- 
ing adherent showed significant differences in age, 
BMI, and physical activity. Participants who did not 
finish the study were significantly younger (41 versus 
52 years of age), had a higher BMI (33.1 versus 30.1 
kg/m2), and had significantly more sedentary lifestyles

reached the target values for total cholesterol, 17 for 
LDL cholesterol, 6 for triglyceride levels, and 14 for BMI. 
As for the MD, only 7 subjects reached the target values 
for total cholesterol, 6 for LDL cholesterol, 8 for triglyc- 
eride levels, and 10 for BMI. 
Cardiovascular Risk Profile 
Both diets resulted in a significant improvement of the 
participants’ cardiovascular risk profile. Forty-six par- 
ticipants during the Vd (44.2% of the participants who 
completed the Vd phase) and 35 during the MD (34% 
of the participants in whom the MD was initiated) mod- 
ified their risk category by reaching the target values 
recommended by the European Society of Cardiology15 
for ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor (total cholesterol level 
≤190 md/dL, LDL cholesterol level ≤115 mg/dL, triglyc- 
eride level ≤150 mg/dL, glucose level ≤110 mg/dL, BMI 
DISCUSSION 
This randomized dietary intervention trial is the first to 
compare the effectiveness of a low-calorie Vd and a 
similar MD in improving the cardiovascular risk profile 
of a clinically healthy omnivorous population living in 
a low-risk country for cardiovascular disease. The most 
significant result was that, at the end of the 3-month 
intervention period on a low-calorie Vd and MD, simi- 
lar reductions in total body weight, BMI, and total fat 
mass were observed, with no differences between the 
diets. In addition, although the Vd was more effective 
in reducing LDL cholesterol levels, the MD was more

effective in reducing triglyceride levels. Regarding the 
oxidative stress and inflammatory profiles, both diets 
contributed to a significant improvement in most pa- 
rameters; however, a significant difference was seen 
in the interleukin-17 level, which improved only in the 
MD group.

In line with previously conducted studies, the 
present study also shows the beneficial effect of Vd 
and MD on body weight, BMI, and fat mass. A re- 
cent meta-analysis by Barnard et al21 identified 6 trials 
that analyzed a vegetarian-like period and reported 
a significant reduction in total body weight, with an 
average mean reduction of 3.4 kg. In the same year, 
the results of an additional meta-analysis, including 
12 randomized controlled trials that involved partici- 
pants who followed a VD, reported similar findings, 
with a mean reduction of 2.2 kg with respect to the 
nonvegetarian group.22 In our study, despite a similar 
significant trend, we found a slightly lower reduction 
in the body weight among the participants following 
the Vd (‒1.74 kg). This difference in terms of body 
weight change can be explained by the fact that the 
results of previously conducted intervention studies 
investigated not only VDs but also vegan diets and 
other forms of vegetarianism, different study popu- 
lations were analyzed, the durations of intervention 
were different, and there was a lack of a comparable 
diet for most studies. In the present study, the com- 
parison diet was the MD, widely reported to be one 
of the healthiest dietary models in the reduction of 
the risk burden of chronic degenerative diseases.13 
In recent decades, several intervention studies have 
demonstrated the beneficial effects of a low-calorie 
MD on body weight and several anthropometric mea- 
surements.13 The present study confirms this finding 
and extends the evidence of the beneficial effects of 
the MD on body weight, in comparison with those 
of a similar low-calorie Vd. The possible mechanisms 
explaining the effects of both Vd and MD in reduc- 
ing body weight and fat mass may be related to the 
higher consumption of certain beneficial food groups 
such as complex carbohydrates, legumes, fruits, and 
vegetables. All of these food groups are rich in fiber, 
and several studies have reported an inverse associa- 
tion between fiber consumption and weight loss via 
effects on satiety, as well as fat reduction and glucose 
absorption.23 In the present study, the intervention 
diets did not differ in the percentage of calories ob- 
tained from macronutrients and the main categories 
of food (except for animal products and legumes) and 
were isocaloric. However, we cannot exclude the pos- 
sibility of a greater reduction in kilocalories in the Vd 
compared to the MD. 
With regard to the lipid profile, these results dem- 
onstrate the beneficial effects of both diets; in the case 
of the Vd, a significant reduction in the LDL cholesterol 
level was noted, whereas in the case of the MD, the 
triglyceride levels were significantly reduced. A recent 
meta-analysis that included 11 randomized trials, con- 
ducted on participants who followed vegetarian diets 
versus those who followed control diets, reported a 
significant lowering of total cholesterol, LDL choles- 
terol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 
but not triglyceride levels.24 Nevertheless, literature on 
the beneficial effects of VDs on triglyceride levels is 
inconsistent and contrasting.7 Some studies reported 
the beneficial effects of VDs on triglyceride levels, 
whereas others did not observe any significant effect. 
In the present study, we confirmed the beneficial ef- 
fects of the Vd in the reduction of LDL cholesterol by 
extending the results to clinically healthy participants 
living in a country at low risk for cardiovascular dis- 
ease. However, no effects of the Vd on triglyceride and 
high-density lipoprotein levels were observed. The null 
effect of the Vd on triglyceride levels may be explained 
by the paradoxical effects of an increased level of cir- 
culating triglyceride levels because of the high content 
of carbohydrate and total fat that occurs when meat 
and meat products are eliminated from the diet, as 
reported by other studies.25 In our study, the 2 diets 
were not essentially different in terms of the weekly 
portions consumed by these food groups, so the null 
effect on triglyceride does not seem to follow this hy- 
pothesis. However, we observed a beneficial effect of 
the MD on triglyceride levels as reported by interven- 
tion studies.13 
The Vd and MD can reduce lipid parameters through 
different mechanisms. The Vd is low in cholesterol, total

fat, and saturated fatty acid,26 leading to lower intake 
and thus lower rates of absorption and conversion into 
cholesterol in the bloodstream.27 In our dietary study, 
the Vd administered to our study participants entailed a 
significantly lower daily intake of cholesterol. The MD, 
in contrast, can reduce triglyceride levels through its 
beneficial components, including olive oil, dietary fiber, 
and many phytonutrients.28 
As expected, in the intervention period with the 
Vd, a significant reduction in vitamin B12 levels was ob- 
served. This reduction, despite being clinically irrelevant 
and within the normal range, confirms that the Vd may 
lead to lower levels of this vitamin, as previously report- 
ed by other studies.29 This issue warrants further investi- 
gation because, over an extended period, a decrease in 
vitamin B12 associated with Vd can lead to a deficiency 
that may be clinically relevant. Indeed, the official posi- 
tion of scientific societies and agencies is unequivocal: 
participants following VDs and vegan diets should be 
screened for vitamin B12 deficiency and eventually en- 
couraged to use fortified foodstuffs or supplements to 
ensure adequate vitamin B12 intake.30 
As for the oxidative profile, no difference between 
the Vd and MD was observed. To the best of our knowl- 
edge, this study is the first to evaluate these parameters 
after a period of intervention with the Vd, whereas sev- 
eral results have already been obtained for the MD.31 
Previously conducted studies on food categories such 
as wheat, fruit, and vegetables have signaled the ben- 
eficial role of nutrients in reducing the circulating levels 
of reactive oxygen species,32 but no data on the short- 
term effect of VDs have yet been published. 
With regard to the inflammatory parameters, this di- 
etary intervention study is the first to include a Vd and 
evaluate a large pattern of pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines. A significant difference between the Vd and 
MD was observed only for interleukin-17, which sig- 
nificantly increased during the Vd and significantly de- 
creased during the MD period. Several studies in the 
past reported a strict association between vitamin B12 
and inflammation, possibly through the modulation of 
the metabolic cycle of homocysteine.33 In addition, a 
relationship between higher levels of interleukin-6 and 
lower levels of vitamin B12 has been previously report- 
ed34 and is supported by our results because we ob- 
served an inverse and significant correlation between 
changes in the interleukin-6 and vitamin B12 levels 
(r=0.22; P=0.026). Thus, it can be postulated that the 
Vd leads to a decrease in vitamin B12 levels and an in- 
crease in homocysteine levels, with a consequent wors- 
ening of the inflammatory profile. 
The strengths of the study include the crossover de- 
sign, the comparability between the 2 diets in terms 
of total energy and macronutrients, the high rate of 
adherence, and the various parameters analyzed in the 
same group of participants at different time points. 
However, some limitations are present, such as the lack 
of data on blood pressure levels, the limited duration 
of the study, and the limited number of participants 
who completed the whole study. We are aware that 3 
months of intervention is a limited period and permits 
only the suggestion of the possible interpretation of the 
results. Studies with a larger population and a longer 
duration are needed to confirm these results. However,

despite the limitations, the present study included the 
largest cohort of omnivorous participants who under- 
went a period on a Vd. 
In conclusion, in the context of the behavioral coun- 
seling that promoted a reduced caloric intake, the re- 
sults of this dietary randomized intervention study, the 
first comparing a Vd and MD in the same group of 
clinically healthy omnivorous participants, showed no 
difference in weight change between the Vd and MD 
groups, but the Vd reduced LDL cholesterol levels com- 
pared with the MD, which reduced triglyceride levels 
compared with the Vd.
