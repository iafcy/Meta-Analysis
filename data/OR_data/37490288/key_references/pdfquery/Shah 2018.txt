Background-—Dietary interventions may play a role in secondary cardiovascular prevention. hsCRP (High-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein) is a marker of risk for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease. 
Methods and Results-—The open-label, blinded end-point, EVADE CAD (Effects of a Vegan Versus the American Heart Association- 
Recommended Diet in Coronary Artery Disease) trial randomized participants (n=100) with coronary artery disease to 8 weeks of a 
vegan or American Heart Association–recommended diet with provision of groceries, tools to measure dietary intake, and dietary 
counseling. The primary end point was high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A linear regression model compared end points after 
8 weeks of a vegan versus American Heart Association diet and adjusted for baseline concentration of the end point. Signiﬁcance 
levels for the primary and secondary end points were set at 0.05 and 0.0015, respectively. A vegan diet resulted in a signiﬁcant 
32% lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (b, 0.68, 95% conﬁdence interval [0.49–0.94]; P=0.02) when compared with the 
American Heart Association diet. Results were consistent after adjustment for age, race, baseline waist circumference, diabetes 
mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction (adjusted b, 0.67 [0.47–0.94], P=0.02). The degree of reduction in body mass index and 
waist circumference did not signiﬁcantly differ between the 2 diet groups (adjusted b, 0.99 [0.97–1.00], P=0.10; and adjusted b, 
1.00 [0.98–1.01], P=0.66, respectively). There were also no signiﬁcant differences in markers of glycemic control between the 2 
diet groups. There was a nonsigniﬁcant 13% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the vegan diet when compared 
with the American Heart Association diet (adjusted b, 0.87 [0.78–0.97], P=0.01). There were no signiﬁcant differences in other 
lipid parameters. 
Conclusions-—In patients with coronary artery disease on guideline-directed medical therapy, a vegan diet may be considered to 
lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a risk marker of adverse outcomes.

reductions in hsCRP (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) have 
been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in 
patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD).7–9 
Approximately one third of patients with stable CAD have an 
hsCRP above the upper limit of normal, and there is a complex 
interplay between inﬂammation and glucometabolic disease 
that may further exacerbate cardiovascular risk.10–18 Further- 
more, up to 45% of patients will continue to have elevated 
risk despite anti-inﬂammatory 
hsCRP and thus residual 
therapy.7 Therefore, investigation of additional strategies to 
address the residual risk associated with inﬂammation in 
these patients are warranted. 
The American Heart Association’s (AHA) strategy to reduce 
the health burden associated with CAD has a focus on a healthy 
diet and lifestyle.19 Although multiple dietary factors inﬂuence 
CAD, few studies examine a particular diet compared with the

either a vegan diet or the AHA-recommended diet. Major 
exclusion criteria included (1) history of an eating disorder; 
(2) already on a vegetarian or vegan diet; (3) use of steroids or 
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory medications other than aspirin; 
(4) history of a myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass 
graft surgery within the preceding 3 months; (5) presence of 
infection within the preceding 3 months; and (6) have a 
planned staged coronary revascularization or other surgical 
procedure during study period. Potential participants were also 
excluded if they had a score of >4 on any of the amotivational 
items or if the relative autonomy index (deﬁned as average of 
answers for the 6 autonomous items—average of answers for 
the 6 controlled items) was ≤0 on a treatment self-regulation 
questionnaire28 (Figure 1).

Lake City, UT) was the primary sponsor of the trial and did 
not contribute to the study design or data analysis. 

This trial utilized a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded 
end point study design.29 A 1-to-1 randomization sequence was 
computer generated by the study biostatistician. Only the 
biostatistician and a member of the cardiovascular clinical 
research center, who was not a member of the study team, had 
access to this sequence and provided the dietary assignment 
via e-mail after the participant provided written informed 
consent. Participants were randomized at least 7 days after 
invasive coronary angiography so that medication regimens 
would be as stable as possible during the study period. The 
active study duration was 8 weeks, with an interim visit at 
4 weeks and a ﬁnal visit at 8 weeks. Between visits, partici- 
pants in both treatment groups had access to the study’s 
registered dietitian by telephone and e-mail, and a 24-hour 
dietary recall was performed twice a week on random days. In 
addition, participants were instructed to ﬁll out a 4-day food 
record during the 1 week before each of the 3 visits. Groceries 
that supported the dietary recommendations of the interven- 
tion assignment were provided on a weekly basis, along with a 
cookbook (Simply Vegan, Baltimore: Vegetarian Resource 
Group, 2012; or AHA Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cookbook, 
New York: Clarkson Potter, 2008), handouts from the Nutrition 
Care Manual of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (www.ea 
tright.org), a 2-week sample menu, food scale, measuring 
spoons, and measuring cups. As previously described, the 
dietary intervention was kept as similar as possible, with only 
substitution of animal-based protein for plant-based protein on 
handouts, grocery menus, 2-week sample menus, and

standard recommended heart-healthy diet in patients with 
CAD.20–22 A plant-based vegan diet has been shown to 
signiﬁcantly reduce adverse markers of poor cardiovascular 
health over time, but limited data include a heart-healthy diet as 
the comparator arm in patients receiving guideline-directed 
medical therapy.23–26 Lack of the same support resources in the 
intervention and control groups have confounded prior direct 
comparisons of the diets alone. Furthermore, several prior 
studies of a vegan diet provided full meals, 
limiting the 
generalizability of 
the results to patients in their home 
environment who do not have access to prepared meals.23,24 
In sum, data on the effects of dietary strategies on systemic 
inﬂammation incremental to medical therapy are limited. 
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a 
vegan versus AHA-recommended diet on hsCRP, as well as 
other markers of inﬂammation, glucometabolic markers, and 
lipid proﬁles in patients with established CAD on guideline- 
directed medical therapy.

made available to other researchers for purposes of repro- 
ducing the results or replicating the procedure, as additional 
analyses may be forthcoming. 

The EVADE CAD (Effects of a Vegan Versus the American Heart 
Association-Recommended Diet in Coronary Artery Disease) 
trial design and rationale have been described in detail.27 
Brieﬂy, between March 11, 2014, and February 2, 2017, 100 
participants from New York University Langone Medical Center 
with a history of angiographically deﬁned CAD (≥50% lesion in 






recipes.27 Physical activity was assessed at each of the 3 study 
visits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire- 
Short Form questionnaire.30 

Adherence was assessed each week using the information 
collected during the two 24-hour dietary recalls as previously 
described.27 Brieﬂy, the following adherence method was 
developed with the aim to use a practical and quantiﬁable 
way of capturing animal protein in a diet using similar criteria 
for both groups. Furthermore, the data to evaluate adher- 
ence were obtained in the same manner in both groups. A 
script was developed by the study registered dietitian to 
allow for consistent interactions with the study participants 
and reduce bias throughout the study. Participants in the 
vegan diet group received 1 point for abstinence from each 
of 
(2) dairy, and 
(3) seafood. Participants in the vegan diet group could earn up 
to 3 points on each of the two 24-hour dietary recalls, and a 
score of 5 to 6 was deﬁned as adherent to the vegan diet for 
that week. Participants in the AHA-recommended diet group 
received 1 point for consumption of each of the following: 
(1) ≤5 oz of animal protein/day, (2) only low-fat/fat-free dairy 
if dairy was consumed, (3) ﬁsh ≥2 times/week. A score of 4 
to 5 deﬁned adherence to the AHA-recommended diet for 
that week. Of note, if a participant in the AHA group did not 
report ﬁsh intake on both dietary recalls, participants were 
asked if they had been eating ﬁsh at least 2 times per week 


at the end of the second 24-hour dietary recall. Participants 
were determined to be adherent at the 4-week interim and 
8-week ﬁnal follow-up visits if they were adherent for at least 
the 3 weeks evaluated between visits. To better 
2 of 
examine whether 
the participants 
the dietary intakes of 
were in the spirit of the guidelines, MyPlate servings of 
fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were also determined in 
each diet group using Food Processor 11.0.137 (ESHA 
Research, Salem, OR). 

The primary end point was hsCRP concentration. Secondary 
end points included the following inﬂammatory markers: white 
blood cell count and subtypes (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio 
and monocyte subtypes), white blood cell cellular adhesion 
molecules (neutrophil-surface expression of L-selectin to 
CD11b ratio, soluble L-selectin, soluble E-selectin, intracellu- 
lar adhesion molecule, vascular cellular adhesion molecule), 
other markers of neutrophil activity (neutrophil gelatinase- 
associated lipocalin, myeloperoxidase), and urine F2-isopros- 
tane/creatinine ratio. 
Other secondary end points included anthropometric data 
(body mass index, waist circumference), glycemic markers 
(fasting blood glucose concentration, hemoglobin A1c level, 
lipid proﬁles (total cholesterol 
blood insulin concentration), 
concentration, non–high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol 
concentration, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol con- 
centration [calculated], LDL size, LDL particle number, small 



additionally adjusted for covariates that may affect systemic 
inﬂammation—age, race, baseline waist circumference, dia- 
infarction. Given their 
betes mellitus, and prior myocardial 
skewed distribution, the end points were log-transformed for 
these analyses and then transformed back to their original 
scale for presentation. Back-transformed beta estimates of 
treatment (vegan versus AHA-recommended diet) along with 
95% conﬁdence intervals were reported to assess the 
magnitude of the effect size. Statistical signiﬁcance was 
tested using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 for the primary end 
the secondary end points after 
point and 0.0015 for 
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. All analyses 
were performed as intention-to-treat. Statistical analyses 
were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics software, 
version 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and SAS 9.4 (SAS 
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). 


Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are shown 
in Table 1. Participants in the vegan diet group were older 
than those in the AHA diet group (63.0 [57.0–68.0] versus 
59.5 [53.0–67.0], P=0.06). The majority of participants were 
white males and had a history of coronary revascularization. 
More than three quarters of the participants had dyslipidemia, 
and more than half had hypertension. Although more than half 
of the participants had a history of tobacco use, only a 
minority of participants actively smoked. Diabetes mellitus 
infarction were present in (cid:3)30% of 
and prior myocardial 
participants, but other major comorbidities were present in 
less than one ﬁfth of the participants. 
Baseline medication use and ancillary cardiac data are also 
shown in Table 1. Almost all participants in both diet groups 
were on aspirin and statin therapy, while a majority were also 
on a P2Y12-inhibitor. More than half of the patients were on 
high-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvas- 
tatin 20–40 mg). The majority of participants had normal left 
ventricular function and signiﬁcant CAD on invasive coronary 
angiography. 

Two participants withdrew from the trial, both of whom were 
from the vegan diet group. One withdrew after 1 week and 
the other after 2 weeks. One participant in the AHA diet group 
refused a blood draw at the 8-week ﬁnal visit.

EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire. 
Endothelium activity was measured, as an exploratory end 
point, in a subset of participants using the EndoPat Device 
(Itamar Medical Ltd, Caesarea, Israel). Major adverse cardio- 
vascular and cerebrovascular event was deﬁned as the 
composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke 
or transient ischemic attack, and repeat coronary revascular- 
ization. Participants were directly asked about interim clinical 
events during study visits. Source documents were collected, 
and the reported events were adjudicated by the study 
investigators blinded to treatment allocation. 

Inc (Cleveland, OH) measured 
certain markers of inﬂammation (hsCRP, myeloperoxidase, 
hemogram with differential), the comprehensive lipid proﬁles, 
and glucometabolic parameters at no cost. Itamar Medical Ltd 
(Caesarea, Israel) provided the EndoPat machine to measure 
endothelial function. These sponsors also did not contribute to 
the study design or data analysis. All other secondary end points 
were measured at New York University School of Medicine. 
Statistical Analyses 
As previously described,27 sample size was calculated using 
preliminary data from our cardiac catheterization laboratory 
(mean hsCRP concentration, 2.07(cid:1)0.57 mg/L), and based on 
an estimated decrease in mean hsCRP concentration by 20% 
with the vegan diet as compared with the AHA diet, 
signiﬁcance level of 0.05, and power of 0.80. Using a 2-sided 
2-sample t test, the number of participants needed in each 
group was estimated to be 30. After adjusting for a 40% ﬂoor 
effect (including possible participant drops), the sample size in 
each group was increased to 50. 
Summary data are presented as median [interquartile 
range] for continuous variables and proportion (frequency) for 
categorical 
variables. Continuous data were compared 
between the 2 dietary groups with the Mann–Whitney test, 
and categorical data were compared between the 2 dietary 
groups with Fisher’s exact test or chi-squared test. Changes in 
dietary and physical activity data within each dietary group 
over time were compared using a related-samples Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test. 
The primary analyses compared the 2 dietary strategies for 
the change in end points from baseline to 8 weeks. End points 
after 8 weeks of dietary intervention were assessed in the 
vegan diet group with AHA-recommended diet group as the 
reference using a linear regression model. Model 1 was adjusted 
for the baseline concentration of the end point. Model 2 was

during the 8-week study period, 1 did not use tobacco 
between the 4-week interim and 8-week ﬁnal visit, and 1 
continued to use tobacco throughout the 8 weeks of the 
active study. The 1 user of tobacco within the 6 months 
before randomization in the AHA diet group did not use 
tobacco during the 8-week study period. 
A low proportion of participants underwent a cardiac 
rehabilitation program during the 8-week study period in both 
the vegan (n=4) and AHA (n=5) diet groups. 

Dietary intake data over the active study period are shown in 
Table 2. At baseline, there were no signiﬁcant differences in 
reported dietary intake of key nutrients between the 2 diet 
groups. Over time, reported intakes of energy, protein, fat, and 
saturated fat signiﬁcantly decreased in both groups. However, 
at the end of the study period, reported energy intake was 
higher (P=0.01), while protein intake was lower (P<0.001), in 
the vegan versus AHA diet group. Reported carbohydrate 
intake increased over the active study period in the vegan diet 
group (P=0.02) and, at the end of the study period, was higher 
in the vegan versus AHA diet group (P<0.001). Although the 
reported dietary ﬁber intake increased over the study period in 
both diet groups, at the end of the study period, dietary ﬁber 
intake was higher in the vegan versus AHA diet group 
(P<0.001). While intake of grains and vegetables increased in 
the vegan diet group over the study period (P=0.01 and 
P<0.001, respectively), at the end of the study period, only the 
intake of grains was signiﬁcantly higher in the vegan versus 
AHA diet groups (P<0.001). Finally, micronutrient data show a 
lower intake of vitamin B12, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids over 
the study period in the vegan group (P<0.001), and at the end 
of the study period, these micronutrients were signiﬁcantly 
lower in the vegan versus AHA diet groups (P<0.001). 
Physical activity data over the active study period are 
shown in Table 3. Overall, measures of physical activity did 
not differ between diet groups at baseline or at the end of the 
study period. 

Even with inclusion of the 2 trial withdrawals from the vegan 
diet group, there was a higher rate of dietary adherence as 
determined by 24-hour dietary recall data among participants 
in the vegan versus AHA diet groups (4-week interim visit: 
96% versus 84%, P=0.09; 8-week ﬁnal visit: 94% versus 70%, 
P=0.003). 
End Points 
Markers of inﬂammation 
HsCRP concentrations over time with the vegan and AHA diet 
groups are shown in Table 4. The median change in hsCRP 
concentration over the study period was signiﬁcantly lower in 
the vegan versus AHA diet groups (Figure 2). After adjustment 
for baseline concentrations, the vegan diet resulted in a 
signiﬁcant 32% lower concentration of hsCRP when compared 
with the AHA diet (b estimate, 0.68 [95% conﬁdence interval, 
0.49–0.94], P=0.02) (Table 5). After additional adjustment for 
age, race, baseline waist circumference, presence of diabetes 
mellitus, and prior myocardial 
infarction, there remained a 
signiﬁcant 33% lower concentration of hsCRP with the vegan 
versus AHA diet (adjusted b estimate, 0.67 [0.47–0.94], 
P=0.02). Measures of white blood cell activity did not differ 
over time between groups (Table 5). 
Anthropometric data, glycemic markers, and lipid 
proﬁles 
Although weight loss, as measured by body mass index and 
waist circumference, was observed in both diet groups 
(Table 4), the degree of these reductions did not signiﬁcantly 
differ between diet groups (Table 5). Furthermore, there were 
no signiﬁcant differences in fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, 
or insulin concentrations between diet groups (Table 5). 
After adjustment for baseline concentration, the vegan diet 
resulted in a nonsigniﬁcant 12% reduction in LDL cholesterol 
compared with the AHA diet (b estimate, 0.88 [0.80–0.96], 
P=0.008) (Table 5). After additional adjustment for age, race,

and prior myocardial infarction, there remained a nonsignif- 
icant 13% reduction in LDL cholesterol with the vegan versus 
AHA diet (adjusted b estimate, 0.87 [0.78–0.97], P=0.01). 
Other lipid parameters did not signiﬁcantly differ over time 
between diet groups (Table 5). 

Quality of life as measured by the EuroQol 5 dimensions index 
increased over time in both groups (Table 4). However, these 
increases were not signiﬁcantly different between the vegan 
and AHA diet groups (EuroQol 5 dimensions index adjusted b 
estimate, 1.00 [0.96–1.05], P=0.13; current health state

Endothelial function, as assessed by the EndoPat device, was 
available in 80% (n=40) of participants in the vegan diet group 
and 74% (n=37) of participants in the AHA group at both 
baseline and 8-week ﬁnal visits. There was no signiﬁcant 
change in endothelial function over time (vegan diet: baseline 
1.96 [1.62–2.70] to 8-week ﬁnal 1.88 [1.61–2.61], P=0.86; 
AHA diet: baseline 2.12 [1.85–2.48] to 8-week ﬁnal 1.84

was deﬁned as an EndoPat score <1.67, no signiﬁcant change 
in status of endothelial function (abnormal versus normal) was 
noted in 75% of vegan and 84% of AHA diet participants 
(P=0.41); a change was noted to go from normal to abnormal 
in 10% of vegan and 14% of AHA diet participants (P=0.73);

No participants had a myocardial

repeat coronary revascularization, or died during the 8-week

Discussion 
This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial demon- 
strated a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in hsCRP with a 
vegan versus AHA-recommended diet 
in patients with 
established CAD on guideline-directed medical therapy. The 
degree of weight loss, as measured by both body mass index 
and waist circumference, did not signiﬁcantly differ between 
the 2 diet groups. Markers of glycemic control and lipid 
proﬁles, overall, also did not signiﬁcantly differ in the vegan 
diet group when compared with the AHA-recommended diet 
group. 
Strengths of the current study include the use of the AHA- 
recommended diet as the comparator arm and the use of 
similar dietary counseling strategies and pharmacologic inter- 
ventions in both arms with a focus on the only difference being 
consumption of plant-based versus animal-based protein.27 
Earlier studies evaluated the effects of a vegan diet versus a 
control group that consisted of no intervention.23–26 One study 
randomized 46 patients with established or likely CAD to either 
a 1-month program of vegan diet with prepared meals and 
stress management or no intervention.23 This study demon- 
strated an increase in exercise duration and a decrease in 
plasma cholesterol concentrations with the vegan diet. The 48 
patients with angiographically documented CAD randomized to 
a low-fat vegetarian diet in the Lifestyle Heart Trial demon- 
strated regression of atherosclerosis burden over 1 year, while 
the no-intervention group demonstrated progression of dis- 
ease over the study period.25 Of note, none of these patients 
were on lipid-lowering medications during the study period. A 
more recent single-arm prospective cohort study evaluated the 
effects of the MultiSite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program, 
which consisted of a low-fat, whole-foods, plant-based diet; 
exercise; stress management; and group support meetings, in 
56 patients with established or likely CAD and 75 patients with 
at least 3 cardiac risk factors or diabetes mellitus.26 This 
intervention demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in multiple 
indices, 
including C-reactive protein concentrations, body 
mass index, waist/hip ratio, insulin concentrations, and lipid 
proﬁles over the 3 months of the study. 
An additional strength of the current study is that the 
changes in end points noted were in participants with 
established CAD already on guideline-directed medical 
therapy. Although only 35% of participants in the current 
study had hsCRP concentrations ≥2.0 mg/L at baseline, 
>90% of participants had prior coronary revascularization, 
>60% of participants had a prior myocardial infarction, and 
<5% of participants had nonobstructive CAD on invasive 
angiography. Despite signiﬁcant reductions in major adverse 
cardiovascular outcomes with lipid-lowering statin therapy in 
patients with CAD,31,32 there remains a residual risk of 
adverse outcomes in this patient population. In the Further 
Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in 
Subjects with Elevated Risk study, there remained a 9.8% 
rate of major adverse cardiovascular events in the PCSK9 
(proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) 
inhibitor 
therapy group where the median LDL cholesterol was 
decreased to 30 mg/dL.33 Anti-inﬂammatory strategies, on 
the other hand, provide incremental beneﬁt on clinical 
outcomes. The recently published CANTOS (Canakinumab 
Antiinﬂammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) demonstrated 




















Other dietary components such as carbohydrate intake 
may provide important context for the ﬁndings in the current 
study. A recent interim analysis from the international PURE 
(Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, a prospective 
observational cohort study, which did not include the United 
States, evaluated 135 335 participants and demonstrated a 
greater likelihood of all-cause mortality in participants who 
ate the most carbohydrates (average 77% of energy intake) 
versus those who ate the least (average 46% of energy 
intake).37 In the current study, although there was a 
signiﬁcantly higher carbohydrate intake in the vegan group, 
the median proportion of carbohydrate intake was 57% of the 
energy intake, much lower than the group at risk in the PURE 
analysis. Nonetheless, patients on a vegan diet should be 
encouraged to monitor their carbohydrate intake. In the PURE 
study, participants who ate the most total fat (average 35% of 
energy intake) compared with those who ate the least 
(average 11% of energy intake) had a lower likelihood of all- 
cause mortality. These results were consistent across the 
different types of fats. In the current study, there were no 
signiﬁcant differences in the reported intake of total fat as a 
proportion of total energy intake between the 2 diet groups 
(30%). However, the intake of saturated fat was signiﬁcantly 
lower in the vegan group, which may explain the numerical 
improvement in LDL-cholesterol concentration in that group. 
There are several limitations to the current study. First, the 
study cohort reﬂects 14% of the patients who met initial 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, so generalizability may be lim- 
ited. Second, 
the study is not powered to assess for 
differences in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovas- 
cular event. However, lowering hsCRP has been shown to be 
associated with lower outcomes in patients with prior 
myocardial infarction, and study participants will be followed 
for 5 years during which clinical event data are captured.7 
Third, the vegan diet was only compared with 1 other diet— 
the AHA-recommended diet. The study did not 
include 
additional comparator arms, such as the Mediterranean Diet. 
However, both groups were counseled to incorporate protein 
from plant-based sources, including nuts and nut butters, and 
including olive oil.20 
encouraged to use unsaturated oils, 
Furthermore, olive oil was used as an ingredient for food 
preparation in recipes provided to both groups. Fourth, 
participants may have underreported their intake on the food 
records. Fifth, in the context of the dietary adherence protocol 
used, an AHA group participant who consumed no animal 
protein or no dairy would be considered adherent to the AHA- 
recommended diet. However, such a participant would favor 
the null hypothesis. Finally, the exact mechanism of potential 
underlying beneﬁt remains incompletely elucidated given the 
lack of change in the white blood cell–related markers. 
Nonetheless, this is the ﬁrst randomized trial to evaluate the 
effects of a vegan diet compared with one of the more

protein) over the study period in participants with angiographically

signiﬁcant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events 
with a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-1b in patients with 
prior myocardial 
infarction and elevated baseline hsCRP 
concentrations.8 This reduction in outcomes was noted on a 
background of optimal medical therapy independent of lipid 
proﬁles. Notably, there was a heterogeneity of treatment 
effect among CANTOS participants, who achieved an hsCRP 
<2 mg/dL compared with ≥2 mg/dL. Although the current 
study was not powered for clinical outcomes, it is possible 
that decrease in hsCRP with the vegan diet may provide 
added secondary cardiovascular prevention beneﬁt when 
compared with the AHA-recommended diet. 
The observed reductions in hsCRP and LDL cholesterol 
concentrations with the vegan diet may be independent or 
interdependent. The decrease in LDL cholesterol in the vegan 
group did not meet statistical signiﬁcance, and there was no 
signiﬁcant difference in oxidized LDL concentrations over time 
in either group or between groups. If the anti-inﬂammatory 
effect of the vegan diet is independent of its lipid-lowering 
effects, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Subtypes 
of inﬂammatory cells nor the cellular adhesion molecules that 
play a signiﬁcant role in adhesion of inﬂammatory cells to 
injured or inﬂamed endothelium did not differ over time 
between the 2 diet interventions. However, a signiﬁcantly 
higher amount of dietary ﬁber was observed in the vegan arm 
of the current study, and studies have shown that a diet high 
in ﬁber and low in fat is associated with less inﬂammation and 
lower incidence of major cardiovascular outcomes.34–36 While 
the anti-inﬂammatory effect of ﬁber is well established, the 
underlying mechanism remains unclear. Data 
suggest 
increased ﬁber intake may restore gut microbiota, which 
may, in turn, improve the inﬂammatory proﬁle.34

States on multiple parameters of

CAD on guideline-directed medical therapy. 

In conclusion, in patients with CAD and an elevated hsCRP 
despite guideline-directed medical therapy, a vegan diet may be 
considered to further lower this marker of adverse outcomes. 
The vegan diet does not appear to provide signiﬁcant added 
beneﬁt when compared with the AHA-recommended diet in 
lipid proﬁle

improvement.
