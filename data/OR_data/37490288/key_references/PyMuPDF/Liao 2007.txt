Abstract
Objective: This study investigated the effects of a soy-based low-calorie diet on weight control,
body composition, and blood lipid proﬁles compared with a traditional low-calorie diet.
Methods: Thirty obese adults (mean body mass index 29–30 kg/m2) were randomized to two
groups. The soy-based low-calorie group consumed soy protein as the only protein source, and the
traditional low-calorie group consumed two-thirds animal protein and the rest plant protein in a 1200
kcal/d diet for 8 wk. A diet record was kept everyday throughout the study. Food intake was
analyzed before and after the study. Anthropometric data were acquired every week, and biochem-
ical data from before and after the 8-wk experiment were compared.
Results: Body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist circumference signiﬁcantly
decreased in both groups (P  0.05). The decrease in body fat percentage in the soy group (2.2%,
95% conﬁdence interval 1.6–2.8) was greater than that in the traditional group (1.4%, 95%
conﬁdence interval 0.1 to 2.8). Serum total cholesterol concentrations, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentrations, and liver function parameters decreased in the soy-based group and were
signiﬁcantly different from measurements in the traditional group (P  0.05). No signiﬁcant change
in serum triacylglycerol levels, serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting
glucose levels was found in the soy or traditional group.
Conclusion: Soy-based low-calorie diets signiﬁcantly decreased serum total cholesterol and low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and had a greater effect on reducing body fat
percentage than traditional low-calorie diets. Thus, soy-based diets have health beneﬁts in reducing
weight and blood lipids.

Introduction
The prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide has
dramatically increased in recent decades [1]. Compelling
evidence has linked obesity not only to various chronic
diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hyperten-
sion, stroke, cholecystolithiasis, and gout, but also to can-
cer, including colorectal and breast cancers [2,3]. In 1996,
the World Health Organization and the Food and Agricul-
ture Organization announced that obesity can be regarded as
a chronic disease and emphasized the importance of main-
taining an ideal body weight. According to results from a
survey in Taiwan in 1998 [4], nearly 25% of adults are
overweight. This report indicates that obesity has become a
serious public health problem in Taiwan. Energy imbalance,
i.e., energy intake higher than energy expenditure, is the
main reason for people becoming overweight and obese.
Dietary patterns are closely related to obesity [5,6].
Soy contains abundant nutrients and is a common com-
ponent of the traditional Chinese diet. Soybean proteins are
used in a variety of forms, including infant formulas, ﬂours,
protein isolates and concentrates, and textured ﬁbers. Soy-
containing foods include cheese, drinks, miso, tempeh, tofu,
salami, and vegetarian meat substitutes. It has been shown
that a soy-based diet has a weight-loss effect and can pre-

vent obesity because soy is rich in dietary ﬁber, thereby
increasing satiety [7], and that a soy-based meal helps to
decrease fat mass [8]. Further, soy peptide seems to improve
the thermic response of brown adipose tissue and thus may
be a useful treatment option for obesity [9,10]. However,
those ﬁndings were based on animal studies, and no clinical
studies have examined the results of a weight-loss program
using soy products for obese people. The effectiveness of
soy products on weight loss is still unclear [11]. Therefore,
this study investigated the effects of a soy-based diet on weight
management and body composition. The results of this study
will be applied to clinical therapies for the overweight and
obese and to decrease morbidity associated with obesity.
Materials and methods
Subjects
This study was carried out at Taipei Medical University.
Flyers and leaﬂets were used to recruit 30 volunteers (6 men
and 24 women) before the experiment’s start date. Subjects
had to be 20–60 y of age, have a body mass index (BMI)
26 kg/m2, and have no history of chronic disease, includ-
ing cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and diabetes
mellitus. Female subjects could not be pregnant or breast-
feeding. All subjects submitted written informed consent
before their participation. The guidelines and procedures
were approved by the research ethics committee of Taipei
Medical University, Taiwan.
Study design
Subjects were randomly allocated to two groups: a tra-
ditional group (traditional low-calorie diet) and a soy group
(soy low-calorie diet). The soy group consumed soy protein
as the only protein source, and we provided various soy
foods, including drinks, miso, tofu, and vegetarian meat
substitutes, from markets. Each subject in the soy group
received a meal box for every lunch and dinner for 8 wk.
Two-thirds of the protein for the traditional group was
animal protein, and the rest was plant protein. Table 1 lists
differences in the prescribed diet content for each group. We
also educated participants on the dietary guidelines for
1200-kcal diets and clariﬁed the concepts of protein sources
and food portions. A meal plan was given to subjects in the
traditional group, but no prepared food. Both groups were
given lectures on weight management at each visit. A diet
record was kept everyday throughout the study. Food intake
records were analyzed using Nutritionist Pro 1.0 (E-Kitchen
Business Corp., Taiwan). Thirty subjects completed the study.
Anthropometric measurements including height, weight, blood
pressure, and body composition were weekly measured. Bio-
chemical parameters were analyzed at the beginning and the
end of the intervention. Side effects including gastrointes-
tinal symptoms, effects on skin, hair, and bone, and physical
activity were evaluated.
Anthropometric measurements
The height of each subject was measured with a stadi-
ometer. Body composition including body weight and body fat
percentage were determined with the InBody 3.0 Body Com-
position Analyzer (InBody 3.0, Biospace, Seoul, Korea),
which uses an 8-point tactile electrode system that measures
the total and segmental impedance and phase angle of al-
ternating electric current at four different frequencies. It was
used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ac-
curacy of this measurement to assess percentage of body fat
was reported by many researchers [12]. Subjects took a rest
for 30 min before measurement. Then subjects took off
excess clothing (coats, sweaters), shoes, and socks, stood on
the four foot-electrodes on the instrument’s platform and
held the two palm-and-thumb electrodes with the arms not
touching the torso. Each subject’s height and age were
entered, and the body composition data were calculated by
the device’s software and immediately printed on the paper
obtained from the manufacturer. Waist circumference was
measured with an inelastic scale.
Blood pressure
Blood pressure was measured on the subject’s right arm
with a mercury sphygmomanometer by trained personnel who
conﬁrmed and pressed the pulse before the measurement.
Biochemical measurements
Venous blood samples were collected at the beginning and
the end of the intervention for analysis of serum glucose,
triacylglycerols, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate
transaminase. Blood samples were drawn after overnight fast-
ing and immediately centrifuged. Blood biochemical parame-
ters were measured at the laboratory of Taipei Medical Uni-
versity Hospital. Serum total cholesterol, triacylglycerols,
HDL-C, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate

pyruvate transaminase were determined by enzymatic methods
[13–15]. The LDL-C concentration was calculated using
Friedewald’s formula [16]. The plasma glucose concentration
was measured using the glucose oxidase method.
Statistical analysis
All data were presented as mean  standard deviation.
Differences between the beginning and the end of treatment
were tested with paired t test. We used Student’s t test to
compare differences between the traditional group and the
soy group. SPSS 10.0 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) was used to analyze the data. P  0.05 indicated
statistical signiﬁcance.
Results
Thirty subjects (6 men and 24 women) completed the
8-wk intervention study. Fifteen subjects (3 men and 12
women) were assigned to the soy group and 15 subjects (3
men and 12 women) consumed the traditional low-calorie
diet. Baseline subject characteristics were similar between
groups except age. The traditional group was older than the
soy group but there was no signiﬁcant difference. The initial
BMI of subjects given the soy low-calorie diet was 29.6 
3.0 kg/m2, and the initial body weight was 76.2  14.1 kg.
The initial BMI of subjects given the traditional low-calorie
diet was 30.0  3.9 kg/m2, and the initial body weight was
77.6  16.9 kg. There was no signiﬁcant difference in the
characteristics of the two groups at the beginning of the
study (Table 2). No adverse events occurred at the end of
the intervention.
Both low-calorie diets signiﬁcantly reduced body weight,
BMI, and body fat percentage (P  0.05) over 8 wk (Table
2). Body fat percentage losses for subjects at 8 wk were
2.2% of initial body weight (95% conﬁdence interval 1.6–
2.8) in the soy group and 1.4% (95% conﬁdence interval
0.1 to 2.8%) in the traditional group. The BMI of the soy
group decreased by an average of 0.2 kg/m2 per week, and
the total decrease was 1.6 kg/m2 (P  0.05). The soy group
and the traditional group were not signiﬁcantly different in
waist circumference or blood pressure after 8 wk.
After the intervention, the soy group had signiﬁcantly
lower levels of serum total cholesterol, serum LDL-C, glu-
tamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate
transaminase than the traditional group (P  0.05). After
the 8-wk program, the soy group had signiﬁcantly decreased
levels of serum total cholesterol and serum LDL-C (P 
0.05), whereas the traditional group had signiﬁcantly de-
creased serum total cholesterol levels (P  0.05). Neither
group had any signiﬁcant change in serum HDL-C levels
(Table 3). The HDL-C/total cholesterol ratio of the soy group
was slightly higher than that of the traditional group after 8 wk.
Serum triacylglycerol and fasting glucose levels had decreased
slightly in both groups after weight reduction, but there was no
signiﬁcant difference between the two groups.
In the soy group, caloric and carbohydrate intakes signiﬁ-
cantly differed between the initial and ﬁnal periods, whereas
protein, fat, and dietary ﬁber intake did not (Table 4). These
data indicated that subjects appeared to accept the low-calorie
diets of the program.
Discussion
In this study, the effectiveness of weight loss in the soy
low-calorie diet group was similar to that in the traditional
low-calorie diet group, whereas the body fat percentage of
the soy group signiﬁcantly decreased compared with that of
the traditional group. Both groups showed signiﬁcant de-
creases in body weight of an average of 0.6 kg/wk, which is
within the suggested ideal weight loss rate of 0.5–1 kg/wk
[17,18]. Maskarinec et al. [19] showed that having beans in
the diet, including legumes, tofu, and soy products, was
negatively related to BMI after adjustment for daily energy
intake. A very low-energy diet containing soy [20] or a
high-soy-protein diet [21] may be better at maintaining
nitrogen balance and reducing body fat by preventing fur-
ther increase in protein breakdown in healthy obese people.

Moreover, replacement of animal protein in the diet with
soybean protein has been reported to reduce weight and
improve lipid metabolism. Anderson and Hoie [22] reported
that obese and hypercholesterolemic subjects using a com-
mercial soy-based liquid meal replacement had signiﬁcant
reductions in weight, although using milk meal replacement
did not reduce weight for 12 wk, and soy-based diets led to
greater reduction in serum cholesterol and LDL-C levels
than milk-based diets. These investigators also considered
that a soy diet might promote faster weight loss than a meal
replacement and an energy-restricted (1500 kcal/d) diet
over the ﬁrst 8 wk [23]. In another clinical study, 11 obese
women were provided with a diet of 1000 kcal/d over 12 wk
in which a soy-based or a milk-based liquid formula re-
placed two regular meals. The soy-based diet reduced serum
cholesterol by 20% from the initial level, whereas no effect
was seen with the milk diet [24]. Allison et al. [8] reported
that a soy-based meal replacement formula of 1200 kcal/d
was effective in not only lowering body weight and fat mass
but also reducing LDL-C in obese subjects over 12 wk,
which agrees with our study ﬁndings. In our study, body fat
percentage, serum cholesterol levels, LDL-C levels, and
liver function parameters decreased more in those on a
soy-based diet than those on a traditional low-calorie diet.
Therefore, we suggest that soy as the major protein source
may be beneﬁcial for weight loss.
The capacity of soy protein to regulate weight and lipid
metabolism might be explained by its amino acid constitu-
tion and other ingredients. In comparison with most other
legumes, soybean contains a high percentage of protein,
higher absolute amounts of dispensable amino acids such as
arginine, glycine, and alanine, and a high percentage of
isoﬂavones including genistein and daidzein. Recent re-
search indicates that soy protein reduces the expression of
sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 [25], which in-
hibits lipid accumulation and the expression of lipogenic
genes, resulting in the reduction in body fat to the degree
seen in subjects in this study. Aoyama et al. [26] found that
the body fat content in obese rats fed energy-restricted diets
with soy protein isolate, 90% protein based on dry weight
and the most concentrated form of soy protein, and its
hydrolysate was signiﬁcantly lower than that in those fed a
casein diet. In hypercholesterolemic individuals, isolated
soy protein distinctly modulates the fractional synthesis
rates of triacylglycerol fatty acids and free cholesterol and
reduces circulating triacylglycerol and cholesterol levels
[27]. In addition, soy isoﬂavones stimulate sterol regulatory
element binding protein-2, increasing serum cholesterol
clearance [28], and soy-based diets with high or low isoﬂa-
vone content affect several mechanisms to regulate lipid
oxidation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ac-
tivation [29]. Those studies showed that the constitution of
soy foods is a key to the regulation of lipid metabolism, and
thus soy consumption can improve blood lipid proﬁles.
However, it is critical to show that single components or
complex components of soy are associated with lipid metab-
olism. In this study, by using many soy foods common at the
market in Taiwan, including drinks, miso, tofu, salami, and
vegetarian meat substitutes, we found signiﬁcant reductions in
body fat percentage and blood lipid proﬁles. Therefore, intake
of different soy foods might regulate lipid accumulation and
metabolism because of their complex ingredients.

In addition, promoting satiation and altering secretion of
gut hormones are mechanisms by which soy foods are
involved in weight loss. Lang et al. [30] compared soy, egg
albumin, gelatin, pea protein, and wheat gluten in six
lunches, and no effect was seen on 24-h food intake or
satiety. However, in a comparison by Anderson and col-
leagues [31] of a combination of sucrose and 45 g of soy
protein with egg albumin or casein, satiety was increased
after soy and sucrose consumption. The complex carbohy-
drates and dietary ﬁber contained in soy take longer to pass
through the gastrointestinal system and have low glycemic
indexes [32], which is beneﬁcial for weight control [10].
McLaughlin et al. [33] proposed that trypsin inhibitors in
soy reduce food intake and stimulate cholecystokinin re-
lease, increasing satiety, and that is the reason for soybeans’
association with weight control. Other studies have shown
that the special structures or amino acid sequences of soy
protein act directly on rat small intestinal mucosal cells to
stimulate cholecystokinin release [34], readily inducing sa-
tiety. In our data we found that the soy group had a signif-
icant reduction in calorie intake; the soy protein may have
been more satiating.
Soy serves as a source of good-quality protein for hu-
mans. Consumption of soy foods is increasing because of
the reported beneﬁts for nutrition and health [35,36]. Soy-
based meal replacement formulae improve weight reduc-
tion, anthropometric proﬁle, serum lipids, and blood pres-
sure for obese adults during caloric restriction [37]. In
addition, a high-soy-protein diet can improve glycemic con-
trol in overweight and obese people [23]. Soy protein may
protect the obese against obesity-linked renal disease and
metabolic syndrome [29,38]. According to a follow-up
study, soy protein is a suitable protein source in energy-
restricted diets for the treatment of obesity and may lower
some risk factors (including hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
and hyperglycosemia) for chronic disease in obese people.
In conclusion, a weight-loss diet containing high-quality
soy products as the main source of protein reduced not only
the body fat percentage but also serum total cholesterol and
LDL-C concentrations, and could improve hyperlipidemia
associated with obesity during a weight-loss program.
