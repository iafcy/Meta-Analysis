Background-—Dietary interventions may play a role in secondary cardiovascular prevention. hsCRP (High-sensitivity C-reactive
protein) is a marker of risk for major adverse cardiovascular outcomes in coronary artery disease.
Methods and Results-—The open-label, blinded end-point, EVADE CAD (Effects of a Vegan Versus the American Heart Association-
Recommended Diet in Coronary Artery Disease) trial randomized participants (n=100) with coronary artery disease to 8 weeks of a
vegan or American Heart Association–recommended diet with provision of groceries, tools to measure dietary intake, and dietary
counseling. The primary end point was high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. A linear regression model compared end points after
8 weeks of a vegan versus American Heart Association diet and adjusted for baseline concentration of the end point. Signiﬁcance
levels for the primary and secondary end points were set at 0.05 and 0.0015, respectively. A vegan diet resulted in a signiﬁcant
32% lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (b, 0.68, 95% conﬁdence interval [0.49–0.94]; P=0.02) when compared with the
American Heart Association diet. Results were consistent after adjustment for age, race, baseline waist circumference, diabetes
mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction (adjusted b, 0.67 [0.47–0.94], P=0.02). The degree of reduction in body mass index and
waist circumference did not signiﬁcantly differ between the 2 diet groups (adjusted b, 0.99 [0.97–1.00], P=0.10; and adjusted b,
1.00 [0.98–1.01], P=0.66, respectively). There were also no signiﬁcant differences in markers of glycemic control between the 2
diet groups. There was a nonsigniﬁcant 13% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with the vegan diet when compared
with the American Heart Association diet (adjusted b, 0.87 [0.78–0.97], P=0.01). There were no signiﬁcant differences in other
lipid parameters.
Conclusions-—In patients with coronary artery disease on guideline-directed medical therapy, a vegan diet may be considered to
lower high-sensitivity C-reactive protein as a risk marker of adverse outcomes.

nﬂammation plays a central role in the progression of
atherosclerosis and is associated with adverse cardiovas-
cular events.1–6 Targeted anti-inﬂammatory therapy and
reductions in hsCRP (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) have
been shown to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in
patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD).7–9
Approximately one third of patients with stable CAD have an
hsCRP above the upper limit of normal, and there is a complex
interplay between inﬂammation and glucometabolic disease
that may further exacerbate cardiovascular risk.10–18 Further-
more, up to 45% of patients will continue to have elevated
hsCRP and thus residual risk despite anti-inﬂammatory
therapy.7 Therefore, investigation of additional strategies to
address the residual risk associated with inﬂammation in
these patients are warranted.
The American Heart Association’s (AHA) strategy to reduce
the health burden associated with CAD has a focus on a healthy
diet and lifestyle.19 Although multiple dietary factors inﬂuence
CAD, few studies examine a particular diet compared with the

standard recommended heart-healthy diet in patients with
CAD.20–22 A plant-based vegan diet has been shown to
signiﬁcantly reduce adverse markers of poor cardiovascular
health over time, but limited data include a heart-healthy diet as
the comparator arm in patients receiving guideline-directed
medicaltherapy.23–26Lack ofthesamesupport resources inthe
intervention and control groups have confounded prior direct
comparisons of the diets alone. Furthermore, several prior
studies of a vegan diet provided full meals, limiting the
generalizability of the results to patients in their home
environment who do not have access to prepared meals.23,24
In sum, data on the effects of dietary strategies on systemic
inﬂammation incremental to medical therapy are limited.
The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a
vegan versus AHA-recommended diet on hsCRP, as well as
other markers of inﬂammation, glucometabolic markers, and
lipid proﬁles in patients with established CAD on guideline-
directed medical therapy.
Methods
The data, analytic methods, and study materials will not be
made available to other researchers for purposes of repro-
ducing the results or replicating the procedure, as additional
analyses may be forthcoming.
Study Cohort
The EVADE CAD (Effects of a Vegan Versus the American Heart
Association-Recommended Diet in Coronary Artery Disease)
trial design and rationale have been described in detail.27
Brieﬂy, between March 11, 2014, and February 2, 2017, 100
participants from New York University Langone Medical Center
with a history of angiographically deﬁned CAD (≥50% lesion in
an artery with ≥2-mm caliber) underwent 1:1 randomization to
either a vegan diet or the AHA-recommended diet. Major
exclusion criteria included (1) history of an eating disorder;
(2) already on a vegetarian or vegan diet; (3) use of steroids or
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory medications other than aspirin;
(4) history of a myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass
graft surgery within the preceding 3 months; (5) presence of
infection within the preceding 3 months; and (6) have a
planned staged coronary revascularization or other surgical
procedure during study period. Potential participants were also
excluded if they had a score of >4 on any of the amotivational
items or if the relative autonomy index (deﬁned as average of
answers for the 6 autonomous items—average of answers for
the 6 controlled items) was ≤0 on a treatment self-regulation
questionnaire28 (Figure 1).
The New York University School of Medicine Institutional
Review Board approved the study, and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent. The trial is registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02135939). The Purjes Foundation (Salt
Lake City, UT) was the primary sponsor of the trial and did
not contribute to the study design or data analysis.
Study Design
This trial utilized a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded
end point study design.29 A 1-to-1 randomization sequence was
computer generated by the study biostatistician. Only the
biostatistician and a member of the cardiovascular clinical
research center, who was not a member of the study team, had
access to this sequence and provided the dietary assignment
via e-mail after the participant provided written informed
consent. Participants were randomized at least 7 days after
invasive coronary angiography so that medication regimens
would be as stable as possible during the study period. The
active study duration was 8 weeks, with an interim visit at
4 weeks and a ﬁnal visit at 8 weeks. Between visits, partici-
pants in both treatment groups had access to the study’s
registered dietitian by telephone and e-mail, and a 24-hour
dietary recall was performed twice a week on random days. In
addition, participants were instructed to ﬁll out a 4-day food
record during the 1 week before each of the 3 visits. Groceries
that supported the dietary recommendations of the interven-
tion assignment were provided on a weekly basis, along with a
cookbook (Simply Vegan, Baltimore: Vegetarian Resource
Group, 2012; or AHA Low-Fat, Low-Cholesterol Cookbook,
New York: Clarkson Potter, 2008), handouts from the Nutrition
Care Manual of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (www.ea
tright.org), a 2-week sample menu, food scale, measuring
spoons, and measuring cups. As previously described, the
dietary intervention was kept as similar as possible, with only
substitution of animal-based protein for plant-based protein on
handouts,
grocery
menus, 2-week
sample
menus,
and
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• In a patient with coronary artery disease on guideline-
directed medical therapy, a plant-based vegan diet may be
an adjunctive treatment to lower high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein.
• A vegan diet does not appear to provide greater beneﬁt
when compared with the American Heart Association–
recommended diet in terms of weight loss, glycemic control,
or dyslipidemia.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• A vegan diet may be used to lower inﬂammation as
measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, a key player
in the development of major adverse cardiovascular events.

recipes.27 Physical activity was assessed at each of the 3 study
visits using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-
Short Form questionnaire.30
Measures of Dietary Adherence
Adherence was assessed each week using the information
collected during the two 24-hour dietary recalls as previously
described.27 Brieﬂy, the following adherence method was
developed with the aim to use a practical and quantiﬁable
way of capturing animal protein in a diet using similar criteria
for both groups. Furthermore, the data to evaluate adher-
ence were obtained in the same manner in both groups. A
script was developed by the study registered dietitian to
allow for consistent interactions with the study participants
and reduce bias throughout the study. Participants in the
vegan diet group received 1 point for abstinence from each
of the following: (1) meat/poultry/eggs, (2) dairy, and
(3) seafood. Participants in the vegan diet group could earn up
to 3 points on each of the two 24-hour dietary recalls, and a
score of 5 to 6 was deﬁned as adherent to the vegan diet for
that week. Participants in the AHA-recommended diet group
received 1 point for consumption of each of the following:
(1) ≤5 oz of animal protein/day, (2) only low-fat/fat-free dairy
if dairy was consumed, (3) ﬁsh ≥2 times/week. A score of 4
to 5 deﬁned adherence to the AHA-recommended diet for
that week. Of note, if a participant in the AHA group did not
report ﬁsh intake on both dietary recalls, participants were
asked if they had been eating ﬁsh at least 2 times per week
at the end of the second 24-hour dietary recall. Participants
were determined to be adherent at the 4-week interim and
8-week ﬁnal follow-up visits if they were adherent for at least
2 of the 3 weeks evaluated between visits. To better
examine whether the dietary intakes of the participants
were in the spirit of the guidelines, MyPlate servings of
fruits, vegetables, and whole grains were also determined in
each diet group using Food Processor 11.0.137 (ESHA
Research, Salem, OR).
End Points
The primary end point was hsCRP concentration. Secondary
end points included the following inﬂammatory markers: white
blood cell count and subtypes (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio
and monocyte subtypes), white blood cell cellular adhesion
molecules (neutrophil-surface expression of L-selectin to
CD11b ratio, soluble L-selectin, soluble E-selectin, intracellu-
lar adhesion molecule, vascular cellular adhesion molecule),
other markers of neutrophil activity (neutrophil gelatinase-
associated lipocalin, myeloperoxidase), and urine F2-isopros-
tane/creatinine ratio.
Other secondary end points included anthropometric data
(body mass index, waist circumference), glycemic markers
(fasting blood glucose concentration, hemoglobin A1c level,
blood insulin concentration), lipid proﬁles (total cholesterol
concentration, non–high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol
concentration, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol con-
centration [calculated], LDL size, LDL particle number, small

particle number), and quality of life as measured by the
EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire.
Endothelium activity was measured, as an exploratory end
point, in a subset of participants using the EndoPat Device
(Itamar Medical Ltd, Caesarea, Israel). Major adverse cardio-
vascular and cerebrovascular event was deﬁned as the
composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke
or transient ischemic attack, and repeat coronary revascular-
ization. Participants were directly asked about interim clinical
events during study visits. Source documents were collected,
and the reported events were adjudicated by the study
investigators blinded to treatment allocation.
The Cleveland HeartLab, Inc (Cleveland, OH) measured
certain markers of inﬂammation (hsCRP, myeloperoxidase,
hemogram with differential), the comprehensive lipid proﬁles,
and glucometabolic parameters at no cost. Itamar Medical Ltd
(Caesarea, Israel) provided the EndoPat machine to measure
endothelial function. These sponsors also did not contribute to
the study design or data analysis. All other secondary end points
were measured at New York University School of Medicine.
Statistical Analyses
As previously described,27 sample size was calculated using
preliminary data from our cardiac catheterization laboratory
(mean hsCRP concentration, 2.070.57 mg/L), and based on
an estimated decrease in mean hsCRP concentration by 20%
with the vegan diet as compared with the AHA diet,
signiﬁcance level of 0.05, and power of 0.80. Using a 2-sided
2-sample t test, the number of participants needed in each
group was estimated to be 30. After adjusting for a 40% ﬂoor
effect (including possible participant drops), the sample size in
each group was increased to 50.
Summary data are presented as median [interquartile
range] for continuous variables and proportion (frequency) for
categorical
variables.
Continuous
data
were
compared
between the 2 dietary groups with the Mann–Whitney test,
and categorical data were compared between the 2 dietary
groups with Fisher’s exact test or chi-squared test. Changes in
dietary and physical activity data within each dietary group
over time were compared using a related-samples Wilcoxon
signed-rank test.
The primary analyses compared the 2 dietary strategies for
the change in end points from baseline to 8 weeks. End points
after 8 weeks of dietary intervention were assessed in the
vegan diet group with AHA-recommended diet group as the
referenceusingalinearregression model.Model1wasadjusted
for the baseline concentration of the end point. Model 2 was
additionally adjusted for covariates that may affect systemic
inﬂammation—age, race, baseline waist circumference, dia-
betes mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction. Given their
skewed distribution, the end points were log-transformed for
these analyses and then transformed back to their original
scale for presentation. Back-transformed beta estimates of
treatment (vegan versus AHA-recommended diet) along with
95% conﬁdence intervals were reported to assess the
magnitude of the effect size. Statistical signiﬁcance was
tested using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05 for the primary end
point and 0.0015 for the secondary end points after
Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. All analyses
were performed as intention-to-treat. Statistical analyses
were performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics software,
version 23 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY) and SAS 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
Results
Baseline Characteristics
Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are shown
in Table 1. Participants in the vegan diet group were older
than those in the AHA diet group (63.0 [57.0–68.0] versus
59.5 [53.0–67.0], P=0.06). The majority of participants were
white males and had a history of coronary revascularization.
More than three quarters of the participants had dyslipidemia,
and more than half had hypertension. Although more than half
of the participants had a history of tobacco use, only a
minority of participants actively smoked. Diabetes mellitus
and prior myocardial infarction were present in 30% of
participants, but other major comorbidities were present in
less than one ﬁfth of the participants.
Baseline medication use and ancillary cardiac data are also
shown in Table 1. Almost all participants in both diet groups
were on aspirin and statin therapy, while a majority were also
on a P2Y12-inhibitor. More than half of the patients were on
high-dose statin therapy (atorvastatin 40–80 mg or rosuvas-
tatin 20–40 mg). The majority of participants had normal left
ventricular function and signiﬁcant CAD on invasive coronary
angiography.
Follow-Up Characteristics
Two participants withdrew from the trial, both of whom were
from the vegan diet group. One withdrew after 1 week and
the other after 2 weeks. One participant in the AHA diet group
refused a blood draw at the 8-week ﬁnal visit.
Clinical covariates
Of the 4 users of tobacco within the 6 months before
randomization in the vegan diet group, 2 did not use tobacco

during the 8-week study period, 1 did not use tobacco
between the 4-week interim and 8-week ﬁnal visit, and 1
continued to use tobacco throughout the 8 weeks of the
active study. The 1 user of tobacco within the 6 months
before randomization in the AHA diet group did not use
tobacco during the 8-week study period.
A low proportion of participants underwent a cardiac
rehabilitation program during the 8-week study period in both
the vegan (n=4) and AHA (n=5) diet groups.
Nutrient and physical activity data
Dietary intake data over the active study period are shown in
Table 2. At baseline, there were no signiﬁcant differences in
reported dietary intake of key nutrients between the 2 diet
groups. Over time, reported intakes of energy, protein, fat, and
saturated fat signiﬁcantly decreased in both groups. However,
at the end of the study period, reported energy intake was
higher (P=0.01), while protein intake was lower (P<0.001), in
the vegan versus AHA diet group. Reported carbohydrate
intake increased over the active study period in the vegan diet
group (P=0.02) and, at the end of the study period, was higher
in the vegan versus AHA diet group (P<0.001). Although the
reported dietary ﬁber intake increased over the study period in
both diet groups, at the end of the study period, dietary ﬁber
intake was higher in the vegan versus AHA diet group
(P<0.001). While intake of grains and vegetables increased in
the vegan diet group over the study period (P=0.01 and
P<0.001, respectively), at the end of the study period, only the
intake of grains was signiﬁcantly higher in the vegan versus
AHA diet groups (P<0.001). Finally, micronutrient data show a
lower intake of vitamin B12, zinc, and omega-3 fatty acids over
the study period in the vegan group (P<0.001), and at the end
of the study period, these micronutrients were signiﬁcantly
lower in the vegan versus AHA diet groups (P<0.001).
Physical activity data over the active study period are
shown in Table 3. Overall, measures of physical activity did
not differ between diet groups at baseline or at the end of the
study period.
Dietary adherence
Even with inclusion of the 2 trial withdrawals from the vegan
diet group, there was a higher rate of dietary adherence as
determined by 24-hour dietary recall data among participants
in the vegan versus AHA diet groups (4-week interim visit:
96% versus 84%, P=0.09; 8-week ﬁnal visit: 94% versus 70%,
P=0.003).
End Points
Markers of inﬂammation
HsCRP concentrations over time with the vegan and AHA diet
groups are shown in Table 4. The median change in hsCRP
concentration over the study period was signiﬁcantly lower in
the vegan versus AHA diet groups (Figure 2). After adjustment
for baseline concentrations, the vegan diet resulted in a
signiﬁcant 32% lower concentration of hsCRP when compared
with the AHA diet (b estimate, 0.68 [95% conﬁdence interval,
0.49–0.94], P=0.02) (Table 5). After additional adjustment for
age, race, baseline waist circumference, presence of diabetes
mellitus, and prior myocardial infarction, there remained a
signiﬁcant 33% lower concentration of hsCRP with the vegan
versus AHA diet (adjusted b estimate, 0.67 [0.47–0.94],
P=0.02). Measures of white blood cell activity did not differ
over time between groups (Table 5).
Anthropometric data, glycemic markers, and lipid
proﬁles
Although weight loss, as measured by body mass index and
waist circumference, was observed in both diet groups
(Table 4), the degree of these reductions did not signiﬁcantly
differ between diet groups (Table 5). Furthermore, there were
no signiﬁcant differences in fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c,
or insulin concentrations between diet groups (Table 5).
After adjustment for baseline concentration, the vegan diet
resulted in a nonsigniﬁcant 12% reduction in LDL cholesterol
compared with the AHA diet (b estimate, 0.88 [0.80–0.96],
P=0.008) (Table 5). After additional adjustment for age, race,

AHA diet (adjusted b estimate, 0.87 [0.78–0.97], P=0.01).
Other lipid parameters did not signiﬁcantly differ over time
between diet groups (Table 5).
Quality of life
Quality of life as measured by the EuroQol 5 dimensions index
increased over time in both groups (Table 4). However, these
increases were not signiﬁcantly different between the vegan

Endothelial function
Endothelial function, as assessed by the EndoPat device, was
available in 80% (n=40) of participants in the vegan diet group
and 74% (n=37) of participants in the AHA group at both
baseline and 8-week ﬁnal visits. There was no signiﬁcant
change in endothelial function over time (vegan diet: baseline

AHA diet: baseline 2.12 [1.85–2.48] to 8-week ﬁnal 1.84
[1.68–2.13], P=0.12). When abnormal endothelial function

Diet and Inﬂammation in Coronary Disease

and a change was noted to go from abnormal to normal in
15% of vegan and 3% of AHA diet participants (P=0.11).
Clinical events
No participants had a myocardial infarction, underwent a
repeat coronary revascularization, or died during the 8-week
study period. No participants had a cerebrovascular event in
the vegan diet group; 2 participants in the AHA diet group had
a probable transient ischemic attack as determined by a
clinical neurologist consultant.
Discussion
This randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial demon-
strated a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in hsCRP with a
vegan
versus
AHA-recommended
diet
in
patients
with
established CAD on guideline-directed medical therapy. The
degree of weight loss, as measured by both body mass index
and waist circumference, did not signiﬁcantly differ between
the 2 diet groups. Markers of glycemic control and lipid
proﬁles, overall, also did not signiﬁcantly differ in the vegan
diet group when compared with the AHA-recommended diet
group.
Strengths of the current study include the use of the AHA-
recommended diet as the comparator arm and the use of
similar dietary counseling strategies and pharmacologic inter-
ventions in both arms with a focus on the only difference being
consumption of plant-based versus animal-based protein.27
Earlier studies evaluated the effects of a vegan diet versus a
control group that consisted of no intervention.23–26 One study
randomized 46 patients with established or likely CAD to either
a 1-month program of vegan diet with prepared meals and
stress management or no intervention.23 This study demon-
strated an increase in exercise duration and a decrease in
plasma cholesterol concentrations with the vegan diet. The 48
patients with angiographically documented CAD randomized to
a low-fat vegetarian diet in the Lifestyle Heart Trial demon-
strated regression of atherosclerosis burden over 1 year, while
the no-intervention group demonstrated progression of dis-
ease over the study period.25 Of note, none of these patients
were on lipid-lowering medications during the study period. A
more recent single-arm prospective cohort study evaluated the
effects of the MultiSite Cardiac Lifestyle Intervention Program,
which consisted of a low-fat, whole-foods, plant-based diet;
exercise; stress management; and group support meetings, in
56 patients with established or likely CAD and 75 patients with
at least 3 cardiac risk factors or diabetes mellitus.26 This
intervention demonstrated signiﬁcant decreases in multiple
indices, including C-reactive protein concentrations, body
mass index, waist/hip ratio, insulin concentrations, and lipid
proﬁles over the 3 months of the study.
An additional strength of the current study is that the
changes in end points noted were in participants with
established
CAD
already
on
guideline-directed
medical
therapy. Although only 35% of participants in the current
study had hsCRP concentrations ≥2.0 mg/L at baseline,
>90% of participants had prior coronary revascularization,
>60% of participants had a prior myocardial infarction, and
<5% of participants had nonobstructive CAD on invasive
angiography. Despite signiﬁcant reductions in major adverse
cardiovascular outcomes with lipid-lowering statin therapy in
patients with CAD,31,32 there remains a residual risk of
adverse outcomes in this patient population. In the Further
Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in
Subjects with Elevated Risk study, there remained a 9.8%
rate of major adverse cardiovascular events in the PCSK9
(proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitor
therapy group where the median LDL cholesterol was
decreased to 30 mg/dL.33 Anti-inﬂammatory strategies, on
the other hand, provide incremental beneﬁt on clinical
outcomes. The recently published CANTOS (Canakinumab
Antiinﬂammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study) demonstrated

signiﬁcant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events
with a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-1b in patients with
prior myocardial infarction and elevated baseline hsCRP
concentrations.8 This reduction in outcomes was noted on a
background of optimal medical therapy independent of lipid
proﬁles. Notably, there was a heterogeneity of treatment
effect among CANTOS participants, who achieved an hsCRP
<2 mg/dL compared with ≥2 mg/dL. Although the current
study was not powered for clinical outcomes, it is possible
that decrease in hsCRP with the vegan diet may provide
added secondary cardiovascular prevention beneﬁt when
compared with the AHA-recommended diet.
The observed reductions in hsCRP and LDL cholesterol
concentrations with the vegan diet may be independent or
interdependent. The decrease in LDL cholesterol in the vegan
group did not meet statistical signiﬁcance, and there was no
signiﬁcant difference in oxidized LDL concentrations over time
in either group or between groups. If the anti-inﬂammatory
effect of the vegan diet is independent of its lipid-lowering
effects, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Subtypes
of inﬂammatory cells nor the cellular adhesion molecules that
play a signiﬁcant role in adhesion of inﬂammatory cells to
injured or inﬂamed endothelium did not differ over time
between the 2 diet interventions. However, a signiﬁcantly
higher amount of dietary ﬁber was observed in the vegan arm
of the current study, and studies have shown that a diet high
in ﬁber and low in fat is associated with less inﬂammation and
lower incidence of major cardiovascular outcomes.34–36 While
the anti-inﬂammatory effect of ﬁber is well established, the
underlying
mechanism
remains
unclear.
Data
suggest
increased ﬁber intake may restore gut microbiota, which
may, in turn, improve the inﬂammatory proﬁle.34
Other dietary components such as carbohydrate intake
may provide important context for the ﬁndings in the current
study. A recent interim analysis from the international PURE
(Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, a prospective
observational cohort study, which did not include the United
States, evaluated 135 335 participants and demonstrated a
greater likelihood of all-cause mortality in participants who
ate the most carbohydrates (average 77% of energy intake)
versus those who ate the least (average 46% of energy
intake).37 In the current study, although there was a
signiﬁcantly higher carbohydrate intake in the vegan group,
the median proportion of carbohydrate intake was 57% of the
energy intake, much lower than the group at risk in the PURE
analysis. Nonetheless, patients on a vegan diet should be
encouraged to monitor their carbohydrate intake. In the PURE
study, participants who ate the most total fat (average 35% of
energy intake) compared with those who ate the least
(average 11% of energy intake) had a lower likelihood of all-
cause mortality. These results were consistent across the
different types of fats. In the current study, there were no
signiﬁcant differences in the reported intake of total fat as a
proportion of total energy intake between the 2 diet groups
(30%). However, the intake of saturated fat was signiﬁcantly
lower in the vegan group, which may explain the numerical
improvement in LDL-cholesterol concentration in that group.
There are several limitations to the current study. First, the
study cohort reﬂects 14% of the patients who met initial
inclusion/exclusion criteria, so generalizability may be lim-
ited. Second, the study is not powered to assess for
differences in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovas-
cular event. However, lowering hsCRP has been shown to be
associated with lower outcomes in patients with prior
myocardial infarction, and study participants will be followed
for 5 years during which clinical event data are captured.7
Third, the vegan diet was only compared with 1 other diet—
the AHA-recommended diet. The study did not include
additional comparator arms, such as the Mediterranean Diet.
However, both groups were counseled to incorporate protein
from plant-based sources, including nuts and nut butters, and
encouraged to use unsaturated oils, including olive oil.20
Furthermore, olive oil was used as an ingredient for food
preparation in recipes provided to both groups. Fourth,
participants may have underreported their intake on the food
records. Fifth, in the context of the dietary adherence protocol
used, an AHA group participant who consumed no animal
protein or no dairy would be considered adherent to the AHA-
recommended diet. However, such a participant would favor
the null hypothesis. Finally, the exact mechanism of potential
underlying beneﬁt remains incompletely elucidated given the
lack of change in the white blood cell–related markers.
Nonetheless, this is the ﬁrst randomized trial to evaluate the
effects of a vegan diet compared with one of the more

Diet and Inﬂammation in Coronary Disease
Shah et al
ORIGINAL RESEARCH

commonly referenced dietary recommendations in the United
States
on
multiple
parameters
of
inﬂammation,
glu-
cometabolic, and lipid proﬁles in patients with established
CAD on guideline-directed medical therapy.
In conclusion, in patients with CAD and an elevated hsCRP
despite guideline-directed medical therapy, a vegan diet may be
considered to further lower this marker of adverse outcomes.
The vegan diet does not appear to provide signiﬁcant added
beneﬁt when compared with the AHA-recommended diet in
terms of weight loss, glycemic control, or lipid proﬁle
improvement.
