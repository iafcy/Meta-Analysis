of a multicomponent worksite intervention
S Mishra1, ND Barnard1,2, J Gonzales3, J Xu1, U Agarwal1 and S Levin3
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects on macro- and micronutrient intake of a nutrition intervention program in
corporate settings across the United States.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-two individuals who were overweight or had type 2 diabetes were recruited
from 10 sites of a US insurance company. Two hundred and seventy-one participants completed baseline diet recalls, and 183
participants completed dietary recalls at 18 weeks. Sites were randomly assigned to an intervention group (ﬁve sites) or to a control
group (ﬁve sites) for 18 weeks. At intervention sites, participants were asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet and attend weekly group
meetings. At control sites, participants continued their usual diets. At baseline and 18 weeks, participants completed 2-day diet
recalls. Between-group differences in changes in nutrient intake were assessed using an analysis of covariance.
RESULTS: Compared with those in the control group, intervention-group participants signiﬁcantly reduced the reported intake of
total fat (P ¼ 0.02), saturated (P ¼ 0.006) and monounsaturated fats (P ¼ 0.01), cholesterol (P ¼ 0.009), protein (P ¼ 0.03) and calcium
(P ¼ 0.02), and increased the intake of carbohydrate (P ¼ 0.006), ﬁber (P ¼ 0.002), b-carotene (P ¼ 0.01), vitamin C (P ¼ 0.003),
magnesium (P ¼ 0.04) and potassium (P ¼ 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: An 18-week intervention program in a corporate setting reduces intake of total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol
and increases the intake of protective nutrients, particularly ﬁber, b-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and potassium. The reduction
in calcium intake indicates the need for planning for this nutrient.

INTRODUCTION
Many US Americans consume diets that are overly high in energy
and in constituents associated with disease risk, particularly
saturated fat (SFA), cholesterol and sodium and low in protective
components such as ﬁber or b-carotene.1 Poorly balanced diets
contribute to overweight, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes
and other conditions.2–4
In clinical research studies, individuals who adopt diets emphasiz-
ing vegetables, fruits, whole grains and legumes report signiﬁcant
reductions in the intake of fat and cholesterol and increases in ﬁber,
b-carotene, magnesium, potassium and vitamin K intake.5,6 Plant-
based diets are associated with improvements in body weight,
plasma lipid concentrations,7 glycemic control8 and blood pressure9
and may assist in the management of prostate cancer.10–12
We tested a program designed to translate a plant-based
dietary intervention from the research environment to the
workplace. An initial controlled study at two corporate sites of
the Government Employees Insurance Company, a large US
insurer, showed that providing instruction in the use of plant-
based diets tended to cause weight loss, improvements in plasma
lipid concentrations and, for those with diabetes, improved blood
glucose control.13 A subsequent trial at 10 corporate Government
Employees Insurance Company sites in diverse regions of the
United States showed similar results.14
As plant-based diets may alter a wide range of macronutrient
and micronutrient intakes affecting health in many ways, we
sought to assess the nutrient changes associated with the
intervention diet in the latter study. Those nutrient changes are
the focus of the current report. We hypothesized that a plant-
based dietary intervention would reduce the intake of energy, SFA
and cholesterol and increase the intake of ﬁber, b-carotene,
vitamin C and potassium.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study design and major physiological results have been described
elsewhere.14 Brieﬂy, the overall study tested the hypothesis that a program
including a low-fat vegan diet taught through group sessions at worksites
in widely divergent areas of the United States would elicit improvements
in body weight and other health indicators. The study was intended
to translate the ﬁndings of intervention trials into a simple program

that could be implemented for large groups of individuals at work. It was
designed not to test individual program components (for example, a diet
or a group of classes) but rather to assess the effect of the intervention
program as a whole, similar to the design of the Diabetes Prevention
Program, which tested the combined effects of diet and exercise
interventions in individuals at risk for diabetes.15
Individuals aged 18 years or above with a body mass index of
X25 kg/m2 or a previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were recruited
through employee notices at 10 Government Employees Insurance
Company corporate ofﬁces in the United States: Tucson, Arizona;
San Diego, California; Lakeland, Florida; Macon, Georgia; Chevy Chase,
Maryland; Buffalo, New York; Woodbury, New York; Dallas, Texas;
Fredericksburg, Virginia; and Virginia Beach, Virginia. Exclusion criteria
were current alcohol or drug abuse, pregnancy, history of severe mental
illness, unstable medical status, current adherence to a low-fat vegetarian
diet, participation in the previous Government Employees Insurance
Company study and inability to attend weekly meetings.
Interested individuals attended a group meeting with the research staff.
Those who appeared to satisfy the participation criteria were scheduled for
individual interviews to review the study procedures and conﬁrm
eligibility. These interested individuals were then asked to complete a
practice 2-day online diet recall.
The study was approved by an external institutional review board
(Independent
Review
Consulting,
whose
name
was
later
changed
to Ethical and Independent Review Services, Corte Madera, CA, USA.).
All participants provided written informed consent.
Worksites were then pair-matched based on the number of volunteers
per site. Each pair of sites represented a cluster, and, using a random-
number table, the sites within each pair were randomly assigned to the
intervention (ﬁves sites) or control (ﬁve sites) groups. As the assignment
was done by site rather than by individual, all participants at a given site
were in the same assigned group. This method was used because of the
likelihood that the intervention, which would be strongly apparent in the
work environment, would tend to inﬂuence the behavior of individuals
throughout the worksite, including those not assigned to the intervention
group.
At intervention sites, participants were asked to follow a low-fat vegan
diet and attend weekly group meetings. They received no monetary
compensation. Individuals at control sites were given no dietary guidance
and were not asked to make any dietary changes. They were given
monetary compensation in the form of gift certiﬁcates to retail stores
(Whole Foods Market or Target), totaling $50 for completion of all baseline
and week-18 assessments. The rationale for compensation of control-
group participants was that, unlike the intervention group, they received
no other beneﬁt from the study and had no contact with the investigators,
aside from the assessments. All participants in both groups were asked to
avoid changing exercise patterns during the study period.
Intervention diet
Participants at intervention sites were asked to avoid animal products
(that is, meat, poultry, ﬁsh, dairy products and eggs) and to base their diets
on whole grains, vegetables, legumes and fruits. They were also
encouraged to minimize added oils and to favor foods with a low
glycemic index, such as beans, fruit, pasta, rye and pumpernickel bread
(rather than typical wheat breads), and oatmeal or bran cereal (rather than
typical cold cereals). No restrictions were placed on portion sizes or on
energy or carbohydrate intakes. Intervention-group participants were also
asked to take a daily supplement of vitamin B12, such as a multiple vitamin.
At intervention sites with cafeterias, food service managers were asked to
include low-fat plant-based menu options, such as oatmeal, minestrone or
lentil soup, veggie burgers and portobello sandwiches, among the daily
offerings. Whether and how to implement such menu additions were
left to their discretion, and their progress in doing so was not formally
assessed.
Participants at intervention sites were asked to follow the prescribed
diet for 18 weeks. They were provided group support in the form of weekly
lunch-hour classes at the worksite led by a registered dietitian, physician
and/or a cooking instructor, following an established curriculum for the
duration of the study. Classes included sessions on replacements
for animal products, healthful snacking, dining out, travel, shopping and
cooking, as well as nutrition-related health topics such as weight loss,
diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Group discussions during each session
focused on common diet challenges and successes. Participants were
offered additional support through an interactive online message board on
which they could ask or respond to questions. All instructors received
training in study procedures and best practices for facilitating group
discussion and used identical instruction materials (a standardized
curriculum, handouts, videos, instructions for cooking, and so on).
Assessment of dietary intake and adherence to dietary
intervention
The following measures were assessed at baseline and week 18:
A diet recall was used to assess nutrient intake over two 24-h periods at
baseline and two 24-h periods at 18 weeks, using an online (Automated
Self-administered 24-h Recall, ASA-24) program developed by the National
Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD, USA).16
The format and design of the ASA-24 are based on the interviewer-
administered Automated Multiple Pass Method 24-h recall developed by
the US Department of Agriculture. The online program has the advantages
of ease of use and scoring and face validity; however, although the
Automated Multiple Pass Method is a validated instrument, validation trials
of ASA-24 remained in progress at the time of this study.17 Subjects were
asked to complete their diet records online as best they could. Subjects
were advised of vegan items that ASA-24 does include, such as vegan
burger, seitan and tofu, and of common vegan items that are not on
ASA-24, such as quinoa and tempeh. Subjects were instructed not to skip
any entries even if exact matches were not found in ASA-24. Instead, they
were coached on how to ﬁnd a suitable alterative, such as substituting
brown rice for quinoa or vegetarian sub for vegan sandwich. Registered
dietitians cross-checked data on ASA-24 by taking participant nutrient data
and entering them into the USDA nutrient database to make sure nutrient
intake numbers were relevant to ASA-24. Numbers that appeared erroneous
were excluded, such as an intake of 500 calories reported for an entire day.
Macronutrient intakes were reported as percentages of total energy intake,
and ﬁber and micronutrients were reported as quantities per 1000kcal.
As animal products are the only signiﬁcant source of dietary cholesterol,
cholesterol intake reported at 18 weeks served as a rough gauge of
adherence to the intervention diet. The numbers of group participants
whose cholesterol intake was p50 mg/day (the amount of cholesterol
in B2 ounces of typical meats or cheeses) and p75 mg/day (the amount
of cholesterol found in B3 ounces of typical meats or cheeses) were
calculated from 18-week diet recalls. The number of group participants
whose fat intake was below 25 and 35% of the total calorie intake was also
calculated. Use of low-glycemic-index foods was not tracked.
All participants were asked to continue their pre-existing medication
regimens unless otherwise instructed by their personal physicians. No
other restrictions were placed on medication use.
Statistical analysis
Student’s
t-tests
and
w2-tests
were
used
to
assess
whether
any
demographic or clinical measures between groups at baseline were
unbalanced. Nutrient data were examined for extreme values, and
distributions of variables were examined for skewness using a normality
plot and the Shapiro–Wilk test.
Statistical analyses of nutrient intake were performed on an intention-to-
treat basis, including all participants who completed an initial diet recall,
with the post-intervention values for dropouts set to the pre-intervention
values. A second analysis was limited to participants who completed diet
recalls at baseline and 18 weeks. The signiﬁcance of within-group changes
in dietary variables was determined using paired t-tests. A general linear
model univariate analysis (analysis of covariance) was used to estimate the
treatment effect and determine whether the changes in nutrient intake of
the intervention and control groups during the 18-week trial were
signiﬁcantly different from each other. Diet group was included as a ﬁxed
factor in these models, with the baseline value of each nutrient as a
covariate. In addition, the geographic site was added to the model as a
random effect to account for within-site correlation in outcomes. As the
number of sites was small, the signiﬁcance of and conﬁdence intervals for
treatment effect were computed using the Kenward–Roger correction.
All analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis Software, SAS
version 9.2. (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) P-valueso0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant.

Fredericksburg, Woodbury, Dallas and Virginia Beach. Of 319
volunteers screened for eligibility, 292 (142 at intervention sites
and 150 at control sites) met the participation criteria and were
enrolled in the overall clinical trial. Of this group, 271 (130 at
intervention sites and 141 at control sites) completed usable
baseline diet recalls and constituted the baseline sample for the
current inquiry. At 18 weeks, 183 (78 in the intervention group and
105 in the control group) completed diet recalls and were
considered study completers for purposes of the nutrient analysis.
There were no signiﬁcant demographic differences between the
intervention and control groups at baseline, except for a some-
what greater percentage of women at control sites (Table 1).
Among completers, the intervention-group and control-group
completers differed only with regard to gender (76% women in
the intervention group, 88% women in the control group,
P ¼ 0.04). Compared with noncompleters, study completers were
older (45.5 versus 41.6 years, P ¼ 0.008) and had a lower mean
baseline body mass index (34.3 versus 37.3 kg/m2, P ¼ 0.006).
The median percentage of group sessions attended per
participant (among the completers at intervention sites) ranged
from 33% in Macon to 75% in Chevy Chase, with an overall
median of 50%.
Adherence to the intervention
Among study completers, cholesterol intake at 18 weeks was
p75 mg/day for 85% (66/78) of intervention-group participants
and
21%
(22/105)
of
control-group
participants
(Po0.001).
Cholesterol intake was p50 mg/day for 74% (58/78) of interven-
tion-group participants but only 13% (14/105) of control-group
participants (Po0.001).
Total fat intake was p35% of the total calorie intake for 86%
(67/78) of intervention-group participants compared with 40%
(42/105) of the control-group participants (Po0.001). Fat intake
was p25% for 49% (38/78) of intervention-group participants and
for 8% (8/105) of control-group participants (Po0.001).
SFA intake was p10% of total calorie intake for 88% (69/78) of
intervention-group participants and 38% (40/105) of control-
group participants (Po0.001). SFA intake was p5% of total calorie
intake for 51% (40/78) of intervention-group participants but only
for 5% (5/105) of control-group participants (Po0.001).
Nutrient intake at baseline and 18 weeks
At baseline, there were signiﬁcant differences between partici-
pants in the two study arms with respect to the percentage of
energy from fat (P ¼ 0.04) and vitamin B12 per 1000 kcal (P ¼ 0.05).
During the 18-week intervention, both groups reduced the
reported energy intake but the between-group difference was
not signiﬁcant (Table 2). Comparing nutrient intake changes over
time between the two groups in the intention-to-treat analysis,
adjusting for baseline values and accounting for within-site
correlations in outcome, the intervention group signiﬁcantly
reduced the mean reported intake of fat, particularly of SFA but
also of monounsaturated fat (Table 2). It increased carbohydrate
and ﬁber intake and reduced protein and cholesterol intake.
The intervention group also increased the reported intake of
b-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and potassium. The calcium
intakes of both groups were below the recommended levels at
baseline, and calcium intake fell further in the intervention group.
Limiting the analysis to study completers, results were similar to
those in the intention-to-treat analysis (Table 3). Overall reported
energy intake fell in both groups. Compared with changes in
the control group, the intervention group reduced the reported
intake of fat (total, monounsaturated fat and SFA), protein and
cholesterol and increased carbohydrate and ﬁber intake. In
addition, retinol intake fell, which was compensated for by an
increase in b-carotene. Reported intakes of vitamin K, vitamin B6,

folate, vitamin C, iron, magnesium and potassium increased,
whereas calcium intake decreased.
DISCUSSION
A nutrition intervention program at the workplace yielded
clinically important changes in nutrient intake. These changes
were similar to those previously reported in clinical research
settings, suggesting that these research ﬁndings effectively
translated into an intervention implemented at worksites in
widely divergent areas of the United States.
The overall reported energy intake fell in both groups. Part of
this reduction may be because of underreporting, which is
common in clinical trials of non-institutionalized participants.18,19
Another possible explanation is that because ASA-24 does not
contain common vegan food items, subjects may have omitted
these foods, resulting in lower energy intake reports. However, it is
likely that the reduced energy intake of the intervention group is,
at least in part, on account of increased ﬁber intake and reduced
fat intake, both of which would tend to reduce the energy density
of the diet. In turn, a reduction in energy intake favors weight loss,
which has been observed in prior studies using low-fat, plant-
based diets20 and was observed in the current study.14 Reductions
in reported energy intake and weight loss commonly occur with
plant-based diets, even in the absence of speciﬁc limitations on
energy intake or speciﬁc guidance regarding portion control.20
Diets high in ﬁber may also facilitate removal of cholesterol,21,22
with favorable effects for individuals at risk of cardiovascular
disease. In a 5-year study of patients with heart disease, a low-fat
vegetarian diet as a part of a program of lifestyle changes has
been shown to reverse atherosclerosis and reduce the risk of
cardiac events.23
Reported protein intake decreased in the intervention group,
but the percentage of energy from protein remained within the
range recommended by the Institute of Medicine.24
Among micronutrients, the intervention group increased the
reported intake of b-carotene, vitamin C, magnesium and
potassium. As expected, vitamin B12 from food sources fell in
the intervention group. However, participants were asked to take
supplemental B12. For both groups, calcium intake was below the
levels recommended by the Institute of Medicine at baseline and
again at 18 weeks, and was dropped in the intervention group.
In estimating calcium requirements, committees have used
varying methods to calculate skeletal accretion and turnover
rates, resulting in a considerable worldwide debate about whether
currently recommended intakes of calcium are adequate to
maximize peak bone mass and to minimize bone loss and fracture
risk in later life.25 However, this may indicate the need for further
instruction on plant-based sources of calcium, such as green leafy
vegetables and legumes. Reported iron intake increased in the
intervention group, reﬂecting the increased intake of plant-based
sources of iron.
The 18-week nutrient intake data indicate that some interven-
tion group participants continued to include some animal
products in their diets and consumed more fat than had been
recommended. Nonetheless, the two groups diverged markedly in
their reported dietary behavior, suggesting that the intervention
elicits signiﬁcant changes even for those participants who do not
fully adhere to the prescribed guidelines. As previously reported,
these nutrient changes are reﬂected in improvements in body
weight, plasma lipid concentrations, and, for those with diabetes,
improvements in glycemic control.14
The tendency of plant-based diets to favorably inﬂuence
nutrient intake and clinical measures related to disease risk raises
the question of their sustainability over the long term. A University
of Pittsburgh survey of young women who had tried both
vegetarian and various calorie-restricted diets26 found that the
mean duration of adherence to vegetarian diets was at least
2 years, compared with only 4 months for calorie-restricted diets.
In the course of dietary intervention trials, adherence, attrition and

Nutrient intake in the GEICO multicenter trial

eating behavior have been studied, and vegetarian and vegan
regimens appear to be generally similar to other therapeutic diets
within these parameters.27
Strengths of the study include participation by individuals from
divergent geographical areas, whose tastes and dietary habits and
whose access to healthful foods likely varied as well; the use of a
dietary intervention that can be reproduced in other corporate
locations; and sufﬁcient statistical power to demonstrate sig-
niﬁcant changes.
The study also has several limitations. Its duration was limited to
18 weeks, primarily on account of the challenges of retaining
untreated control-group participants over a longer period of time.
Had the study design included an active comparison program
within the control group, it may have permitted sufﬁcient
engagement for a longer study, although such a design would
have eliminated the possibility of comparisons with an untreated
control. Nutrient intakes were self-reported. Men were under-
represented in the participant sample for reasons that are unclear.
Randomization was based on geographical site rather than on the
individual participant. Although there appeared to be a reason-
able balance among those variables that were reported, we
cannot assume balance on other unreported or unmeasured
variables. A number of participants failed to complete 18-week
diet recalls. Possible reasons for a failure to complete nutrient
records include limited access to the internet and difﬁculties in
navigating through the ASA-24 online diet recall program.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the present study demonstrated that a simple
nutrition education program using modest group support at the
place of employment yields signiﬁcant improvements in nutrient
intakes. The worksite is a potentially important venue for nutrition
teaching and lifestyle modiﬁcation and merits increased attention.
In interventions using plant-based diets, planning for adequate
intake of vitamin B12 and calcium is important. Future studies
should focus on the longer-term nutrient changes associated
with worksite dietary intervention programs.
CONFLICT OF INTEREST
NDB, JG, JX, UA and SML are on the staff of the Physicians Committee for Responsible
Medicine, a nonproﬁt organization that promotes the use of low-fat, plant-based
diets and discourages the use of animal-derived, fatty and sugary foods. NDB also
writes books and articles and delivers lectures about therapeutic diets, including
vegan diets, and has received royalties and honoraria from these sources. The
remaining authors declare no conﬂict of interest.
