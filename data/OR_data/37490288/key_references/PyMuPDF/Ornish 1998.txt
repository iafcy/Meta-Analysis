Context.—The Lifestyle Heart Trial demonstrated that intensive lifestyle
changes may lead to regression of coronary atherosclerosis after 1 year.
Objectives.—To determine the feasibility of patients to sustain intensive lifestyle
changes for a total of 5 years and the effects of these lifestyle changes (without
lipid-lowering drugs) on coronary heart disease.
Design.—Randomized controlled trial conducted from 1986 to 1992 using a
randomized invitational design.
Patients.—Forty-eight patients with moderate to severe coronary heart disease
were randomized to an intensive lifestyle change group or to a usual-care control
group, and 35 completed the 5-year follow-up quantitative coronary arteriography.
Setting.—Two tertiary care university medical centers.
Intervention.—Intensive lifestyle changes (10% fat whole foods vegetarian diet,
aerobic exercise, stress management training, smoking cessation, group psycho-
social support) for 5 years.
Main Outcome Measures.—Adherence to intensive lifestyle changes, changes
in coronary artery percent diameter stenosis, and cardiac events.
Results.—Experimental group patients (20 [71%] of 28 patients completed
5-year follow-up) made and maintained comprehensive lifestyle changes for 5
years, whereas control group patients (15 [75%] of 20 patients completed 5-year
follow-up) made more moderate changes. In the experimental group, the average
percent diameter stenosis at baseline decreased 1.75 absolute percentage points
after 1 year (a 4.5% relative improvement) and by 3.1 absolute percentage points
after 5 years (a 7.9% relative improvement). In contrast, the average percent diam-
eter stenosis in the control group increased by 2.3 percentage points after 1 year
(a 5.4% relative worsening) and by 11.8 percentage points after 5 years (a 27.7%
relative worsening) (P = .001 between groups. Twenty-ﬁve cardiac events occurred
in 28 experimental group patients vs 45 events in 20 control group patients during
the 5-year follow-up (risk ratio for any event for the control group, 2.47 [95% con-
ﬁdence interval, 1.48-4.20]).
Conclusions.—More regression of coronary atherosclerosis occurred after 5
years than after 1 year in the experimental group. In contrast, in the control group,
coronary atherosclerosis continued to progress and more than twice as many car-
diac events occurred.

THE LIFESTYLE Heart Trial was the
first randomized clinical trial to investi-
gate whether ambulatory patients could
be motivated to make and sustain com-
prehensive lifestyle changes and, if so,
whether the progression of coronary
atherosclerosis could be stopped or re-
versed without using lipid-lowering
drugs as measured by computer-as-
sistedquantitativecoronaryarteriogra-
phy. This study derived from earlier
studies that used noninvasive mea-
sures.1,2
After 1 year, we found that experi-
mental group participants were able to
make and maintain intensive lifestyle
changes and had a 37.2% reduction in
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) choles-
terol levels and a 91% reduction in the
frequency of anginal episodes.3 Average
percent diameter stenosis regressed
from 40.0% at baseline to 37.8% 1 year
later, a change that was correlated with
the degree of lifestyle change. In con-
trast, patients in the usual-care control
group made more moderate changes in
lifestyle, reduced LDL cholesterol lev-
els by 6%, and had a 165% increase in the
frequency of reported anginal episodes.
Average percent diameter stenosis pro-
gressed from 42.7% to 46.1%.
Given these encouraging findings,
we extended the study for an additional
4 years to determine (1) the feasibility
of patients sustaining intensive changes
in diet and lifestyle for a much longer
time, and (2) the effects of these changes
on risk factors, coronary atherosclero-
sis, myocardial perfusion, and cardiac
events after 4 additional years.
METHODS
The design, recruitment, and study
populationwerepreviouslydescribed.3-5
In brief, we recruited men and women

with coronary atherosclerosis docu-
mented by quantitative coronary arte-
riography.
We identified 193 patients as poten-
tially eligible for our study who agreed
to undergo quantitative coronary angi-
ography. Following angiography, 93
patients remained eligible and were ran-
domly assigned to experimental or con-
trol groups using a randomized invita-
tional design to minimize crossover,
ethical concerns, nocebo effects, and
dropout. Of these 93 patients who were
eligible, 53 were randomly assigned to
the experimental group and 40 to the
usual-care control group. Patients were
thencontactedandinvitedtoparticipate
in the study; 28 (53%) and 20 (50%)
agreed to participate in the experimen-
talandcontrolgroups,respectively.The
primary reason for refusal in the experi-
mental group was not wanting to un-
dergo intensive lifestyle changes and/or
not wanting a second coronary angio-
gram;controlpatientsrefusedprimarily
because they did not want to undergo a
secondangiogram.Todetectpossiblese-
lection biases, we collected data on age,
marital status, reported angina, history
of myocardial infarction, height, weight,
number of diseased lesions, and stenosis
severity for all patients who were ran-
domized into the study but refused to
participate. We did not exclude any ex-
perimental group patients who volun-
teeredevenifwedoubtedtheirabilityto
adhere to the lifestyle program. All pa-
tientswhovolunteeredwerefollowedup
using the intention-to-treat principle.
After 1 year, 7 patients did not pro-
vide angiographic data, and the reasons
forlosstofollow-uphavebeenreported.3
Of the remaining 41 patients at baseline
most had severe coronary atherosclero-
sis: 28 had 3-vessel disease, 12 had
2-vessel disease, and 1 had 1-vessel
disease. Two of these patients whose
angiographic data were not usable after
1 year agreed to undergo quantitative
coronary arteriography after 5 years;
theseresultsareincludedinthebaseline
to 5-year comparisons.
Four experimental and 4 control pa-
tientswhohadanangiogramat1yeardid
not have a third angiogram after 5 years.
Three of these 4 patients in the experi-
mental group refused a third angiogram
(patients only volunteered for a 1-year
study that was subsequently extended),
and 1 died between years 1 and 4; of the 4
control group patients who did not un-
dergo a third angiogram, 1 died, 2 under-
went revascularization of the arterial
lesions under study, and 1 developed
Parkinson disease and became too ill to
besafelytested.Cinearteriogramsmade
in San Francisco, Calif, were sent to the
University of Texas Medical School,
Houston, for blinded quantitative analy-
ses as previously described in detail.4
All results, except lesion changes at 1
year (18 experimental and 15 control
subjects) and cardiac events after 5
years(all28experimentaland20control
subjects), are based on the total of 35
patients (20 experimental and 15 control
subjects) who had both baseline and 5-
year angiograms. From these 35 pa-
tients, there were 224 lesions studied at
baseline,ofwhich24were100%occluded
and were excluded a priori from the le-
sion-change analyses per the study pro-
tocol. Of the remaining 200 lesions, 14
were lost to the 4-year follow-up, as fol-
lows: in the experimental group, 2 le-
sionswereexcludedduetotechnicalfail-
ure during the angiogram and 2 had
views that did not match; in the control
group, views did not match for 3 lesions,
3 lesions were excluded due to technical
failure, 1 was excluded due to angio-
plasty, and 3 were excluded due to coro-
nary artery bypass surgery. Of the 186
lesions available for analysis at 4 years,
109 were from the experimental group
and 77 were from the control group.
The 1-year original study and the 4-
year extension were approved by the
committees on human research at Cali-
fornia Pacific Medical Center and Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco, and
each patient signed a written consent
form after being fully informed of the
study requirements.
Patients completed a 3-day diet diary
at baseline and after 1 and 5 years to
assess nutrient intake and dietary ad-
herence.6 Methods of lipid assays were
the same as previously reported.3 These
3-day diet diaries were analyzed with a
software package (CBORD Diet Ana-
lyzer; CBORD Group Inc; Ithaca, NY)
using the US Department of Agricul-
turedatabase.Also,patientswereasked
to complete a questionnaire reporting
the frequency and duration of exercise
and of each stress management tech-
nique. Information from these sources
wasquantifiedintocontinuousscoresus-
ing an a priori determined formula. The
adherence measure was a continuous
score reflecting daily intake of choles-
terol (in milligrams), fat (in grams),
frequency and duration of exercise, fre-
quency and duration of stress manage-
ment techniques, and smoking. A score
of 1.0 equalled 100% adherence but
scores could be greater than 1.0 if par-
ticipantsexceededtherecommendedin-
tensive lifestyle changes.
The technicians responsible for per-
forming all medical tests were blinded to
patientgroupassignment.Also,different
personnel implemented the lifestyle in-
tervention, conducted the tests, and com-
putedstatisticalanalyses,althoughthedi-
etitian was made aware of the nutrient
analysis to monitor patients’ safety and
adherence. Quantitative coronary arte-
riograms were blindly analyzed without
knowledge of group assignment.
Program Intervention
Experimental group patients were
prescribed an intensive lifestyle pro-
gram that included a 10%-fat vegetarian
diet, moderate aerobic exercise, stress
management training, smoking cessa-
tion, and group psychosocial support
previously described in detail.3,7-10 Pa-
tients were encouraged to avoid simple
sugars and to emphasize the intake of
complex carbohydrates and other whole
foods.Only1patientintheexperimental
group was actively smoking at baseline,
and she quit at entry. Control group pa-
tients were asked to follow the advice of
their personal physicians regarding life-
style changes.
Statistical Methods
We decided a priori to use percent di-
ameter stenosis as the primary depen-
dent variable. Statistical methods to
compare the 2 groups were previously
described.3 Analysis of adherence vari-
ables and risk factor levels used time-
structured repeated measures in which
levels from all 3 measurement times
(baseline, 1 year, and 5 years) were in-

cluded in a single regression model. Sta-
tisticalsignificancesofgroupdifferences
were obtained for baseline levels, 1-year
changes, and 5-year changes using F
tests. All repeated measures analyses
wereimplementedusingPROCMIXED
under SAS version 6.08.11 Analysis of le-
sion data used a repeated measures
model in which the repeated measures
were baseline or change values for mul-
tiplelesionswithineachsubject.Change
scores were used for the baseline to 1-
yearandbaselineto5-yearfollow-uppe-
riods, and analysis of baseline levels, 1-
year changes, and 5-year changes were
doneseparately.Again,Ftestsprovided
bySASPROCMIXEDwereusedtotest

of
differences
between
groups with respect to baseline levels,
1-yearchanges,and5-yearchanges.The
SAS PROC MIXED linear regression,
which allowed for dependence in data,
was used to determine the relationship
between adherence and percent diam-
eter stenosis changes. Relative rates for
cardiaceventswereanalyzedandtested
by Poisson regression using exact tests
(Stata 5.0, College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Baseline Comparisons
of Volunteers With Refusals
Those who declined the invitation to
beinthestudyweresimilartothosewho
volunteered in all available data except
those who volunteered were more likely
to have a history of angina (87% vs 65%;
P = .02), a greater number of lesions (4.5
vs 3.5; P = .04), and slightly more se-
verely stenosed lesions (2.3 vs 2.0 on a
3-point scale; P = .05).
Baseline Comparisons
of Experimental Group
With Control Group
Analyses across the 35 volunteers at
baseline for whom 4-year lesion data
wereavailableshowednosignificantdif-
ferences between the experimental
group and the control group in demo-
graphic characteristics, history of myo-
cardial infarction, angioplasty, bypass
surgery, lesion number, lesion stenosis,
dietary fat or cholesterol intake, exer-
cise and stress management practice,
blood pressure, exercise capacity, and
psychosocial measures (Tables 1-3).
Among the many comparisons, only a
few differed significantly (P,.05). More
women were randomly assigned to the
control group (4) than to the experimen-
tal group (1); this fact accounted for half
the weight difference (10 kg) between
the 2 groups and most of the height dif-
ference (6 cm).
Experimental group patients had a
slightly larger body mass index (mea-
suredastheweightinkilogramsdivided
by the square of the height in meters)
(28.4vs25.4kg/m2;P = .03)andhadlower
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terollevels(1.04mmol/L[40.1mg/dL]vs
1.36 mmol/L [52.4 mg/dL]; P = .04),
which was also reflected in lower apoli-
poprotein A-I levels (3.45 mmol/L [133.1
mg/dL] vs 4.08 mmol/L [157.5 mg/dL];
P = .03). The lower body mass index in
the control group may be due to the
larger number of women in the control
group. Other lipid values, including ra-
tiosoftotalcholesteroltoHDLandLDL
to HDL, did not differ significantly at
baseline (Table 4).
Program Adherence
In the experimental group, adherence
to all aspects of the program was excel-
lentduringthe firstyearandgood after 5
years, whereas control group patients
maintained more moderate changes dur-
ing the 5 years consistent with conven-
tional guidelines (Table 2). The percent-
ageofdailyenergy(calories)providedby
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, soy,
other legumes, nonfat dairy, and alcohol
was comparable at 1 year and at 5 years.
In the experimental group, fat intake
decreased from approximately 30% to
8.5%, cholesterol from 211 to 18.6 mg/d,
energy from 8159 to 7724 J (1950-1846
cal), protein from 17% to 15%, and carbo-
hydratesincreasedfrom53%to76.5%.In

the control group, fat intake decreased
from 30% to 25%, cholesterol from 212.5
to 138.7 mg/d, energy from 5.49 to 3.59 J
(1711-1573 cal), protein from 19% to 18%,
andcarbohydratesincreasedfrom51%to
52%. Since patients volunteered origi-
nally only for a 1-year study, there was a
significant decrease in meeting atten-
dance after 1 year for 4 of the patients.
Walking was the recommended form of
exercise, but some patients jogged or did
more strenuous exercise.
Risk Factor Changes
Patients in the experimental group
lost 10.9 kg (23.9 lbs) at 1 year and sus-
tained a weight loss of 5.8 kg (12.8 lbs) at
5 years, whereas weight in the control
group changed little from baseline. In
the experimental group, LDL choles-
terol levels decreased by 40% at 1 year
and remained 20% below baseline at 5
years. In the control group, LDL choles-
terol levels decreased by 1.2% at 1 year
and by 19.3% at 5 years. There were no
statistically significant differences in
LDL levels between the 2 groups at 5
years, primarily because 9 (60%) of
15 control patients took lipid-lowering
drugs between year 1 and year 5 of the
study. None of the experimental group
patients took lipid-lowering drugs dur-
ing the 5 years of the study. Fourteen
patients in the experimental group and
11 patients in the control group took as-
pirin during the study.
Triglycerides did not change signifi-
cantly in either group. Apolipoprotein
A-I did not change in the experimental
group, but it increased in the control
group(P = .04).High-densitylipoprotein
levels and blood pressure did not differ
between the 2 groups.
Angina Pectoris
Experimental group patients had a
91% reduction in reported frequency of
angina after 1 year and a 72% reduction
after 5 years (Table 5). In contrast, con-
trol group patients had a 186% increase
in reported frequency of angina after 1
year and a 36% decrease in frequency
after 5 years. The decrease in angina in
the control group after 5 years was in
large part because 3 of the 5 patients
who reported an increase in anginal epi-
sodes from baseline to 1 year underwent
coronary angioplasty between years 1
and5.Becauseofthisreductioninangina
in control group patients who under-
went revascularization, the between-
group differences were no longer signifi-
cant after 5 years (Table 5).
Angiographic Changes
All detectable lesions that matched at
baseline and 5-year follow-up and were
not 100% occluded at baseline were in-
cluded in the analyses (n = 186). At base-
line, there were no significant differ-
ences between the experimental and
control groups in any measure of lesion
severity (Table 3). In the experimental
group, the average percent diameter
stenosis at baseline decreased 1.75 ab-
solute percentage points after 1 year (a
4.5% relative improvement) and by 3.1
absolute percentage points after 5 years
(a 7.9% relative improvement). In con-
trast, the average percent diameter ste-
nosis in the control group increased by
2.3percentagepointsafter1year(a5.4%
relativeworsening)andby11.8percent-
age points after 5 years (a 27.7% relative
worsening). These between-group dif-
ferenceswerestatisticallysignificantaf-
ter both 1 year and 5 years (P = .02 and
P = .001, respectively, Figure 1).
Figure 2 shows the experimental
group changes in percent diameter ste-
nosis from baseline to 5 years according
to tertiles of adherence to the lifestyle
intervention. As seen at 1 year,3 there
was also a strong correlation between
adherence and percent diameter steno-
sis after 5 years in a dose-response rela-
tionship; the tertile of patients that was
most adherent to the program had the
most regression, the tertile with inter-
mediate adherence had less regression,
and the tertile with the least adherence
halted the progression of disease with-
out regression (P = .04). Of interest is
that this relationship was not related to
age or disease severity. There was no
significant relationship between adher-
ence and lesion changes in the control
group, perhaps because many of these
patients began taking lipid-lowering
drugs, which may have confounded the
ability to detect a possible relationship.
Indeed, we found significant correla-
tions between changes in lipid levels
(LDL and total cholesterol) and changes

in lesions in both groups. These correla-
tions remained significant when exam-
ining either the lipid values at 5 years or
the change in lipid values from baseline
to 5 years.
As a secondary analysis, we examined
the results in control group patients who
began taking lipid-lowering drugs during
thestudy.Percentdiameterstenosispro-
gressed from 45.7% to 51.7%, a change of
6.0absolutepercentagepoints.Inthecon-
trol patients who did not take lipid-low-
ering drugs the disease progressed from
40.7% to 59.7%, a much greater change of
19.0 absolute percentage points. (No ex-
perimental group patients took lipid-low-
ering drugs during the study.)
The change in body mass index from
baseline to 1 year (r = −0.85; P,.001)
and from baseline to 5 years (r = −0.72;
P = .001)wassignificantlycorrelatedwith
the change in percent diameter stenosis
in the control group only. In other words,
thosewhogainedweightweremorelikely
to show progression of atherosclerosis.
Cardiac Events
Data on cardiac events were obtained
from all 48 patients. Cardiac events in-
cluded myocardial infarction, coronary
angioplasty,coronaryarterybypasssur-
gery, cardiac-related hospitalizations,
and cardiac-related deaths. At 5 years,
there were more cardiac events in the
control group (45 events for 20 patients,
or 2.25 events per patient) than the ex-
perimental group (25 events for 28 pa-
tients, or 0.89 events per patient) (Table
6). Control group patients were more
likely to have undergone coronary angi-
oplasty and bypass surgery and/or to
have been hospitalized for cardiac-re-
lated problems than were experimental
group patients.
COMMENT
The primary end point of this study,
chosen a priori, was percent diameter
stenosis.Onaverage,therewasmorere-
duction (continued improvement) after
5yearsthanafter1yearinexperimental
group patients who were asked to make
intensive lifestyle changes. In contrast,
control group patients showed much
moreprogression(continuedworsening)
in average percent diameter stenosis af-
ter5yearsthanafter1year,eventhough
more than half of the control group pa-
tients were prescribed lipid-lowering
medications during the course of the
study. Although the sample size was
relative small,12 these differences were
statistically significant at both 1 year
and 5 years. These findings support the
feasibility of intensive lifestyle changes
in delaying, stopping, or reversing the
progression of coronary artery disease
in ambulatory patients over prolonged
periods.
We found more than twice as many
cardiac events per patient in the control
group than in the experimental group.
These findings are consistent with other
clinical trials showing that even small
changesinpercentdiameterstenosisare
often accompanied by marked reduc-
tions in cardiac events.13-16 Other studies
have demonstrated how quickly the
coronary artery endothelium stabilizes
in response to lipid-lowering drugs.17,18
Althoughtherewassomereductionin
adherence to the intensive lifestyle in-
tervention between years 1 and 5 in the
experimental group, long-term adher-
ence remained remarkably high in this
sample of self-selected patients. The
level of lifestyle change, even at 5 years,
is greater than in any other published
study of ambulatory populations. These
results are especially encouraging be-
cause these patients initially volun-
teered to participate for only 1 year
when they entered the study.
The experimental group reduced LDL
cholesterol levels by 40% at 1 year and by
20% after 5 years; these reductions are
comparable with those achieved with
lipid-lowering drugs in an ambulatory
population.19 In contrast, the Step II diet
reduces LDL cholesterol by only 5% or
less.20,21
High-density lipoprotein levels de-
creased and triglycerides increased in
experimental group patients overall, al-
though the ratio of LDL to HDL was
improved. Recent reports assert that
this phenomenon, which is often seen in
very low-fat diets, may be harmful.22,23
However, patients in the Lifestyle
Heart Trial showed even more regres-
sion of coronary atherosclerosis after 5
years than after 1 year as well as signifi-
cantly decreased cardiac events. Low

HDL cholesterol levels due to reduced
fat intake are the result of a decreased
transport rate rather than the increased
catabolism that is responsible for most
cases of low HDL cholesterol levels in
persons consuming a typical Western
diet.24 Populations consuming low-fat,
plant-based diets have low HDL choles-
terol levels and low rates of coronary
heartdisease.Ourdataprovideevidence
using quantitative coronary arteriogra-
phy in this population that diet-induced
lowering of HDL cholesterol does not
confer the same risk of atherosclerosis
as do low HDL cholesterol levels in
Americans consuming a high-fat diet.25
Experimental group patients whose tri-
glycerides increased during the first
year were asked to minimize their in-
take of simple carbohydrates, and tri-
glyceridelevelsdecreasedbetweenyear
1 and year 5.
The experimental group’s marked re-
duction in frequency, severity, and du-
ration of angina after 1 year was sus-
tainedatsimilarlevelsafter5years.This
long-term reduction in angina is compa-
rable with that achieved following coro-
nary artery bypass surgery or angio-
plasty and helps to maintain long-term
adherence.26Between-groupdifferences
in most measures of chest pain were not
statistically significant after 5 years be-
cause there was a large variability in an-
gina and control group patients who
were the most symptomatic underwent
revascularization.
When we began this study, we be-
lieved that the younger patients with
milder disease would be more likely to
show regression, but we did not find this
tobetrue.Instead,wefoundthatthepri-
mary determinant of change in percent
diameter stenosis in the experimental
group was neither age nor disease se-
verity but adherence to the recom-
mendedchangesindietandlifestyle.This
relationship of adherence to percent di-
ameter stenosis in the experimental
group was found after 1 year3 and also af-
ter 5 years in a dose-response relation-
ship. Coronary artery minimum diam-
eterremainedstableintheexperimental
groupbutmarkedlynarrowedinthecon-
trolgroupduringthe5yearsofthestudy.
At 5 years, the differences between the
experimental and control groups were
statistically significant for both percent
diameter stenosis and minimum diam-
eter, even though control group pa-
tients reported risk reduction behavior
consistent with a Step II diet of the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program
and the American Heart Association:
they consumed an average of 25% of en-
ergy (calories) from fat and exercised an
averageof3.5timesperweek.Thesedata
are consistent with other studies indi-
cating that moderate changes in diet and
lifestyle may not be sufficient to stop the
progression of coronary atherosclerosis
unless combined with lipid-lowering
drugs.27
After 5 years, the normal diameter
(the segment of least narrowing proxi-
mal to the minimum diameter) de-
creased slightly in the experimental
groupbutwidenedslightlyinthecontrol
group.Aslightdecreaseinnormaldiam-
eter, at least up to a point, may improve
myocardial perfusion by streamlining
flow—decreasing
the
forward
flow
losses that occur when going from a
larger to a sharply reduced lumen diam-
eter.4 Conversely, the slight increase in
thenormaldiameterandreductioninthe
minimumdiameterseenincontrolgroup
patients increased the entry angle, fur-
therreducingbloodflow.Thesetheoreti-
cal considerations are consistent with
the substantially increased myocardial
perfusion in the experimental group and
decreased myocardial perfusion in the
control group that we measured using
cardiac positron emission tomography
scans.5
A much earlier study by Morrison28
foundthatmoderatereductionsinfatand
cholesterol intake improved cardiac sur-
vival: after 12 years, all of the control
group patients had died compared with
only 62% of experimental group pa-
tients in a nonrandomized trial. More re-
cently, an important study by Esselstyn
et al29 reported that a similar diet plus
lipid-loweringdrugsin11patientscaused
regression of 11 lesions and stabilization
intheremaining14lesionsafter5.5years.
Although there was no control group,
those who were adherent to the diet re-
portedsubstantiallyfewercardiacevents
than those who were not adherent.29
Like all clinical trials, our study has
limitations. Although the study partici-
pants were a diverse group, they may
not be representative of the general
population of patients with coronary
heart disease. Half of the patients who
underwent quantitative coronary arte-
riography in the participatory hospitals
did not meet all of the inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria and were not invited to
participate in the study. Also, half of the
patients who were invited declined to
enroll in the study. Nevertheless, it is
encouragingthat50%ofthepatientswho
were contacted agreed to volunteer de-
spite the requirement for repeated arte-
riography and that experimental group
patients were able to make and maintain
comprehensive lifestyle changes. The
angiographic measures lost to follow-up
mayhaveaffectedthetreatmentandcon-
trol groups differently, although there
are no data to suggest that this occurred.
In addition, there is a possibility of dif-
ferential loss of lesions in patients, al-
thoughnoevidenceindicatesthatthisoc-
curred; in both groups, there were 14 le-
sions that were lost to follow-up. Also, 4
lesions were lost in the control group to
bypass surgery or angioplasty; since
theselesionswereworseningsufficiently
to require revascularization, the exclu-
sion of these lesions from analysis would
make between-group differences more
difficulttodetect.Werecentlycompleted
a multicenter demonstration project to
assessthepracticalityandcost-effective-
ness of this intervention in a larger
sample of economically and geographi-
cally diverse patients with coronary
heart disease.30
Although we did not use lipid-
lowering drugs in the experimental
group, their value has been demon-
strated in studies that have been pub-
lished since the Lifestyle Heart Trial be-
gan. We do not know if experimental
group patients may have demonstrated
even more improvement by including
lipid-lowering drugs.14-16 Patients in the
control group who were not prescribed
lipid-lowering drugs during the study
showed more than 3 times as much pro-
gression in percent diameter stenosis as
those who were. No experimental group
patients took lipid-lowering drugs dur-
ing the study, yet they showed better re-
sults than control group patients who
were taking these drugs. Lipid-
lowering drugs are expensive, compli-

term safety is unknown.32 In practice,
patients may be offered a range of thera-
peutic options, including comprehen-
sivelifestylechanges,lipid-loweringdrug
therapy, and revascularization, either
separately or in combination.
In summary, these ambulatory pa-
tients were able to make and maintain
comprehensive changes in diet and life-
style for 5 years and showed even more
regressionofcoronaryatherosclerosisaf-
ter 5 years than after 1 year as mea-
sured by percent diameter stenosis. In
contrast, patients following more con-
ventional lifestyle recommendations
showed even more progression of coro-
nary atherosclerosis after 5 years than
after 1 year, and had more than twice as
many cardiac events as patients making
comprehensive lifestyle changes.

counseling and testing data system was begun, and 1 (Florida)
began HIV reporting very recently and not enough time has
elapsed to have adequate data for analysis. The year-to-year me-
dian percentage changes in total number of HIV tests during
1992 through 1996 for areas with and without HIV reporting
were similar in magnitude and trend.2
Although we showed no large declines in testing among MSM
and other risk groups after HIV reporting, we agree with Arago´n
and Myers and Dr Woods and colleagues that trends in some sub-
groups—for example, in a small number of MSM concerned with
reporting issues—could be hidden within the larger community
ofMSM.Becausetherewillalwaysbeindividualsconcernedabout
these issues, we emphasized the importance of making anony-
moustestingavailabletopromoteknowledgeofHIVstatusamong
at-risk people. The approval by the US Food and Drug Admin-
istrationofhomesamplecollectiontestsforHIVexpandstheavail-
ability of anonymous testing in all areas.3
Woods et al also state that, except for New Jersey, we in-
cluded only low-prevalence states. This is incorrect. Louisi-
ana (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] rate of 33.7
per 100 000 in 1997) and Tennessee (25.1 per 100 000) have
high AIDS incidence, comparable with their own state of Cali-
fornia (29.8 per 100 000)1 and are considered moderate-
prevalence states.
Dr Solomon and colleagues are concerned that the study de-
sign was ecological and subject to the fallacy inherent in such
studies, ie, that ecological correlations cannot be validly substi-
tuted for individual correlations. However, to demonstrate the
impact of a policy change on a large population, ecological meth-
odsmaybethemostpracticaldesign.Inanindividual-levelstudy,
each individual’s awareness of the change in policy would be de-
termined. On a population basis, this would be a difficult study
to conduct, especially if attitudes of high-risk persons were to
be assessed. Although our study cannot distinguish between
people who were aware (“exposed”) and unaware (“not ex-
posed”) of the change in reporting policy, the important fact re-
mains that no large changes in testing behavior were observed
in the population. Our results are supported by a recent study
of more than 2500 people in high-risk groups (MSM, IDUs, and
attendees of sexually transmitted disease clinics) in 9 states.4 In
this study, more than 60% of participants were unaware of their
state’s HIV reporting policy and, of those avoiding testing, only
2% stated that reporting was a main factor for not being tested.4
Furthermore, as Dr Paul and colleagues demonstrated in New
Jersey, large numbers of people did not go to nearby states to be
tested after HIV reporting was implemented.
