preference and two dietary options in behavioral weight
management: preliminary results of the impact of diet at 6
months—PREFER study. Obesity. 2006;14:2007–2017.
Objective: The PREFER study objectives were to examine
potential differences in weight loss during a standard be-
havioral intervention between subjects assigned to one of
two calorie- and fat-restricted diets [standard behavior treat-
ment (SBT) and lacto-ovo-vegetarian ([SBTLOV)], with
or without regard to their preferred dietary treatment. This
article reports the differences in outcomes between diet
groups after the first 6 months of the intervention.
Research Methods and Procedures: The study used a four-
group design. Subjects (n  182) were randomized to a
treatment preference group and then to a dietary treatment
group. For this report, preference groups were combined to
permit comparisons by dietary treatment only (SBT, n  98;
SBTLOV, n  84). Additional analyses compared
SBTLOV subjects who were 100% adherent (did not
consume any meat, fish, or poultry, n  47) to those who
were 100% adherent (n  24).
Results: Significant differences were seen in the baseline to
6-month change scores between the two groups for carbo-
hydrate consumption (p  0.013), protein consumption
(p  0.001), polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio (p 
0.009), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C)
level (p  0.013). Among SBTLOV subjects, those who
were 100% adherent experienced greater reductions in
weight (p  0.001), total cholesterol (p  0.026), LDL-C
(p  0.034), and glucose (p  0.002) and consumed less fat
(p  0.030) compared with those who were 100% adher-
ent.
Discussion: Differences between dietary treatment groups
at 6 months were minimal, most likely because one-third of
the SBTLOV group did not follow the vegetarian diet and
because both groups had the same calorie and fat restric-
tions. SBTLOV subjects who were 100% adherent were
more successful at both weight loss and cholesterol reduc-
tion than those who were 100% adherent, suggesting that
vegetarian diets are efficacious for weight and cholesterol
control.
Key words: weight loss, behavioral therapy, lacto-ovo-
vegetarian, adherence, treatment preference
Introduction
Obesity has become a global epidemic contributing to a
wide variety of medical conditions, including hypertension
and cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, gallstones, in-
flammation, osteoarthritis, respiratory problems such as
asthma and sleep apnea, reproductive problems including
infertility, and certain cancers (1–5). A commonly used
treatment is a combination cognitive-behavioral therapy,

referred to as standard behavior treatment (SBT),1 which
includes a low-calorie diet, increased physical activity, and
behavioral therapy (3,6). The recommended dietary ap-
proach is a low-fat diet (25% of calories from fat) with a
calorie deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal/d, which will result in an
initial weight loss of 1 to 2 lb/wk.
Behavioral therapy for obesity has been studied for more
than 20 years. In general, investigators have succeeded in
increasing initial weight loss but not in improving the long-
term maintenance of that weight loss (7). Typically, within
1 year of completing weight loss therapy, individuals regain
approximately 35% of their lost weight, and within 3 to 5
years, they return to their baseline weight (6,7). Currently,
the greatest need in obesity treatment is to improve long-
term maintenance of weight loss through permanent life-
style change.
Individuals who adopt vegetarian diets seem to be more
successful in achieving the goal of long-term lifestyle
change than overweight and obese individuals who tempo-
rarily modify their eating habits to lose weight. They report
following a vegetarian eating plan for longer periods than
those following weight loss diets (8–10). They also report
more satisfaction with the vegetarian eating plan and less
desire to change their diet (10).
Vegetarians not only stay on their diets longer, but they
also seem to adhere more closely to their eating plan than
individuals on traditional weight loss diets (11,12). Barnard
et al. (11) reviewed 30 studies that prescribed dietary mod-
ification for cardiovascular risk reduction and found that
stricter dietary programs yielded greater dietary change. For
example, those prescribed a vegetarian diet consumed a diet
that, on average, contained 24% fat vs. those not prescribed
a vegetarian diet, whose diets contained 30% fat. The two
vegetarian studies reported 100% compliance to the re-
stricted fat goal, whereas the 28 non-vegetarian studies
reported 46% compliance to the restricted fat goal.
Studies not targeting weight loss but using vegetarian
diets have resulted in significant weight loss. Moreover, the
studies demonstrated maintenance of that loss (13–15). Sub-
jects in the Multicenter Lifestyle Demonstration Project lost
an average of 10.7 lb after 2 years and maintained a 7.4 lb
average loss after 3 years (13).
The benefits of a vegetarian diet seem to extend beyond
weight loss. Several studies have reported decreases in
low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) with a vege-
tarian diet (12,13,16). A recent study by Gardner et al. (16)
reported significantly more reduction in both total choles-
terol and LDL-C in a low-fat plant-based diet when com-
pared with a standard low-fat diet. Similarly, in a study of a
low-fat vegetarian diet vs. a placebo supplement, Barnard et
al. (12) found that the low-fat vegetarian diet resulted in
significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, and high-
density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). Szeto et al. (17)
found that long-term vegetarians had a better antioxidant
status and coronary heart disease profile than a group of
age- and sex-matched controls when serum biomarkers
were measured. These studies suggest that a vegetarian or
plant-based diet may protect against coronary heart disease.
The PREFER trial was designed to evaluate the impact of
the interaction between diet type [standard calorie- and
fat-restricted weight loss diet (SBT) vs. calorie- and fat-
restricted lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (SBTLOV)] as part of
SBT and treatment preference [assigned to a preferred diet
group (Treatment Preference–Yes) vs. randomly assigned to
a diet group (Treatment Preference–No)] on weight loss at
18 months. The study also collected information on treat-
ment adherence and biological measures. This report fo-
cuses on the impact of diet type on weight loss and on
biological measures after the first 6 months of the interven-
tion.
Research Methods and Procedures
Design
The PREFER study was a single-center, 18-month, ran-
domized, controlled trial of SBT for weight loss in adults. A
four-group design with two factors was used to compare the
effects of dietary treatment (SBT vs. SBTLOV) and treat-
ment preference (Yes vs. No).
The Institutional Review Board of the University of Pitts-
burgh approved this study, and all subjects provided written
informed consent.
Subjects
Figure 1 presents a subject flow diagram of the study.
Subject recruitment from the community was performed in
three waves, or cohorts, from September 2002 to May 2004.
Recruitment methods included contacting individuals seek-
ing weight loss treatment and listed in the University of
Pittsburgh’s Obesity Nutrition Research Center database;
placing an audio advertisement on the University and Med-
ical Center audix announcement systems; and mailing re-
cruitment cards to individuals on purchased address lists.
Individuals were eligible if they were between 18 and 55
years of age, had a BMI between 27 and 43, were willing to
be randomized to one of the two treatment preference
groups and one of the two dietary groups, and successfully
completed a 5-day food diary. A series of screening proce-
dures was used to exclude individuals who had a serious
illness or unstable condition for which physician supervi-
sion of diet and exercise prescription was needed; had a
cardiovascular or orthopedic condition that would require
physician clearance before participation; had limitations
precluding ability to exercise; were pregnant or intended to

become pregnant in the next 18 months; were being treated
for a psychological disorder; reported alcohol intake of 4
drinks/d; were participating or had recently participated in a
weight loss treatment program or used weight loss medica-
tion; reported no regular intake of meat, fish, and fowl; had
a serious binge eating problem; and did not at least moder-
ately prefer one of the dietary treatments (SBT or
SBTLOV) over the other.
Randomization
Baseline laboratory tests were conducted to confirm eli-
gibility before randomization. Of the 932 individuals who
responded to the recruitment attempts, 200 were random-
ized. Three were excluded after randomization owing to
subsequent events rendering them ineligible.
We used a two-stage scheme, first randomizing to treat-
ment preference groups and then to dietary treatment
groups. In the first stage, subjects were randomized to
Treatment Preference–Yes or Treatment Preference–No
with a 3:2 probability. In the next stage, subjects in the
Treatment Preference–No group were randomized evenly to
either the SBT or the SBTLOV condition. Subjects in the
Treatment Preference–Yes group were not further random-
ized but were treated according to their diet preference. All
subjects who preferred the SBTLOV condition were as-
signed to that group. However, to obtain a fair balance in
size across the four groups, only 50% of those who chose
the SBT were randomly selected for inclusion. Fewer sub-
jects preferred the SBTLOV diet; therefore, 15 additional
subjects who preferred the SBT diet were excluded to
prevent the Treatment Preference–Yes SBT group from
being significantly larger than the Treatment Preference–
Yes SBTLOV group.
Intervention
Subjects in both dietary conditions received 32 treatment
sessions of standard cognitive-behavioral therapy for weight
management over a period of 12 months; the main compo-
nents of this approach included self-monitoring eating and
exercise behaviors, goal setting, cognitive restructuring,
stimulus control, demonstrations, and skill development.
Treatment sessions were held separately for the two dietary
treatment groups. The sessions were identical except for
information on the two dietary plans: an SBTLOV diet
and an SBT diet that permitted meat, fish, and poultry.
Treatment preference was not addressed as part of the
intervention.
Physical activity consisted of a recommendation to in-
crease the participants’ activity to 150 min/d by the sixth
week and thereafter to increase or at least maintain that goal.
We recommended walking as the primary form of struc-
tured activity and encouraged all subjects to increase their
daily activities, such as walking stairs instead of taking
elevators and parking farther away from the store in large

parking lots. Four of the group sessions focused on exercise,
e.g., aerobic training, weights, and resistance exercise. We
monitored and provided feedback to subjects regarding their
recorded activity in their weekly diaries.
Guiding participants in adopting the LOV diet took many
forms. Subjects were instructed to eliminate meat, fish, and
poultry over the first 6 weeks of the study, beginning with
breakfast, then lunch, and, finally, dinner. We introduced
several new foods to participants with tastings that followed
a discussion of the food, e.g., vegetable protein substitutes
such as soy products (tofu, veggie burgers), homemade
dishes using legumes (Lentils Ole), and cheeses made of
vegetable protein. Articles on adapting recipes and numer-
ous recipes were provided on a regular basis. Subjects in
both treatment groups participated in field trips to super-
markets that focused on teaching them how to select pro-
duce and navigate the large food markets, and also cooking
demonstrations; however, the SBTLOV subjects’ excur-
sions focused on a diet that excluded meat, fish, and poultry.
We also addressed the issue that following an LOV diet did
not guarantee a low-fat intake and that they needed to pay
close attention to the fat content of the dairy products and
other sources of protein they were using to replace meat.
Finally, four of the sessions were led by a dietitian who was
a vegetarian and who was able to discuss many of the
everyday challenges one faces in adopting and implement-
ing this type of diet.
All subjects were instructed to restrict consumption of
calories (1200 to 1500 for women and 1500 to 1800 for
men) and fat (25% of total calories) and to engage in
physical activity (walking at least 150 min/wk). Subjects
were instructed to record their daily food intake, the calorie
and fat gram content, and the amount (in minutes) of phys-
ical activity that they performed in their weekly food and
physical activity diaries. Subjects in the SBTLOV group
were told to also record in a specified column on the back
cover of their weekly diaries the number of meat meals
eaten every day.
Sessions were held weekly for the first 6 months, then
every 2 weeks for Months 7 to 9 and monthly for Months 10
to 12. At 12 months, subjects entered the maintenance phase
until the 18-month assessment appointment; during this
phase, subjects did not have contact with the study except to
plan the 18-month assessment appointment.
Subjects were weighed before each treatment session,
and food and physical activity diaries were collected. The
diary that was turned in at the previous session was returned
to the subject with written feedback from the intervention-
ist. If the subject did not attend the session, the diary and
session materials were mailed to the subject.
We provided incentives to promote attendance at the
sessions; e.g., the SBT group participants received the mag-
azine Cooking Light, and the SBTLOV participants re-
ceived the magazine Vegetarian Times. Parking and/or pub-
lic transportation costs were covered. Individuals who had
high levels of attendance were recognized, and flowers were
given to those who achieved 100% attendance.
Measures
Outcome variables were measured at baseline and at 6,
12, and 18 months. Laboratory assessments included a lipid
profile (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycer-
ides), serum glucose, and insulin measurement. Physical
measurements included height, weight, waist circumfer-
ence, and blood pressure. BMI was calculated from height
and weight measures.
Subjects also completed a battery of self-report measures.
Measures of treatment adherence included a Three-Day
Food Record and the Paffenbarger Activity Questionnaire.
Measures of factors related to adherence included the Bar-
riers to Healthy Eating scale, Correlates of Maintenance of
a Low-Fat Diet, Hunger Satiety Scale, Self-Efficacy in
Weight Management, Beck Depression Inventory-II, and
the Medical Outcomes Questionnaire, Short Form-36. Indi-
cators of adherence to the intervention protocol included the
completion of the weekly food and physical activity diaries
as well as attendance at the treatment sessions.
Subjects in the SBTLOV groups were asked to com-
plete the Identity as a Vegetarian Questionnaire at 6, 12, and
18 months. This 20-item investigator-developed question-
naire assessed on a 10-point scale how subjects felt about an
LOV diet (e.g., that it was ethical, nutritional, enjoyable,
easy, affordable) and how strongly subjects identified with
being a vegetarian (feeling comfortable in social situations,
selecting vegetarian options, overall identity).
Statistical Analysis
The current analysis focused only on the effect of the first
6 months of the intervention, using the data collected at
baseline and at 6 months. Analyses followed the intention-
to-treat model; that is, all randomized subjects were in-
cluded in the analyses according to their original assignment
(18). When possible, individuals who withdrew or did not
complete the 6-month assessment were included in the
analysis by using the baseline weight as imputed values; in
other words, no weight change was assumed. The intention-
to-treat approach tends to bias the analyses in the direction
of the null hypothesis of no difference between groups. For
measures that were not conducted at baseline, such as the
Identity as a Vegetarian Questionnaire, individuals who did
not complete the 6-month assessment were excluded from
the analysis.
Preference groups were combined to allow for two-group
comparisons of diet only (SBT vs. SBTLOV). The two
diet groups contained a similar proportion of subjects ran-
domized to Treatment Preference–Yes (SBT  49%,
SBTLOV  43%). Categorical demographic data in-
cluded sex (male vs. female), race (white vs. non-white),

marital status (married vs. not married), and employment
status (employed vs. not employed). Continuous demo-
graphic data included age at entry (years) and education
(years). Continuous variables measured at both the baseline
and 6-month visit included weight (kg) and waist circum-
ference (cm). Continuous variables derived from Three-Day
Food Records at both visits included mean daily intake of
each of the following nutrients: energy (kcal), fat (g), sat-
urated fat (g), monounsaturated fat (g), polyunsaturated fat
(g), carbohydrates (g), and protein (g). The ratio of polyun-
saturated fat to saturated fat was calculated from the Three-
Day Food Record data. Change scores were calculated by
subtracting the 6-month value from the baseline value.
Additional analyses were restricted to the SBTLOV group
only, comparing those who were 100% adherent (had not
consumed meat according to their Three-Day Food Record)
to those who were not 100% adherent.
To assess differences between the dietary treatment
groups and between SBTLOV adherence groups, 2 tests
were performed for categorical data. Exact tests were used
when necessary. For continuous variables, t tests were used
for normally distributed variables, and Mann-Whitney tests
were used when the variables were not normally distributed.
All analyses were performed using SPSS software (SPSS,
Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
No significant differences in demographic variables, in-
cluding age, BMI, and education, existed between the 182
subjects who participated in the study and the 18 subjects
who were removed or became ineligible. The sample had a
29.7% minority representation; however, the sample was
limited in its male representation (12.6%). At baseline, the
mean age was 44.1  8.6 years (range, 20 to 55 years), and,
on average, the subjects had 15.2  2.5 years of education;
63.9% were married or living with a partner, and 81.7%
were employed full-time. The two dietary treatment groups
were compared in terms of demographic characteristics,
and, as shown in Table 1, no significant differences existed
between the two groups.
At baseline, subjects weighed an average of 94.86 
14.58 kg. Men had an average waist circumference of
112.52  10.71 cm; women had an average waist circum-
ference of 104.05  10.71 cm. Subjects consumed an av-
erage of 2039.87  652.12 calories/d; 35% of those calories
were from fat. Average levels of serum total cholesterol,
and specifically serum LDL-C, were higher than desired
(5.29  1.01 mM and 3.22  0.90 mM, respectively). Ten
subjects were on lipid-lowering drugs at baseline (eight in
the SBTLOV group, and two in the SBT group). At 6
months, three of the SBTLOV group subjects and one of
the SBT subjects were no longer on the drugs, and one in
each group had initiated pharmacological treatment for hy-
perlipidemia. For the entire sample, significant changes
were observed at 6 months in all measures except LDL-C
and glucose. Subjects lost an average of 7.21  6.28 kg
(range, 3.15-kg gain to 29.79-kg loss).
Reported physical activity on the Paffenbarger question-
naire revealed no differences between the two groups at
Table 1.

baseline (2109.92 kcal in the SBT group and 1746.53 kcal
in the SBTLOV group) and at 6 months (3123.95 kcal in
the SBT group and 3100.94 kcal in the SBTLOV group).
Over time, both groups significantly increased their physi-
cal activity, by 983.73 kcal in the SBT group and 1252.62
kcal in the SBTLOV group, but the differences in the
increases between the two groups were not significant (p 
0.619).
Baseline and 6-month average measurements of the two
diet groups are shown in Table 2. When the two diet groups
(SBT vs. SBTLOV) were compared, significant differ-
ences were seen in the change scores of carbohydrate con-
sumption (p  0.013), protein consumption (p  0.001),
polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio (p  0.009), and
LDL-C (p  0.013). The SBTLOV participants had a
greater increase in carbohydrate intake, maintained their
protein intake, and increased their polyunsaturated-to-satu-
rated fat ratio more than the SBT group.
Although the average number of meat meals consumed,
according to the Three-Day Food Record, differed signifi-
cantly between the two dietary treatment groups (p 
0.001), not all subjects in the SBTLOV group adhered to
the LOV restrictions. Subjects in the SBTLOV group
recorded consuming an average of 0.26 meat meals per
day (range, 0 to 2.67 meat meals). To investigate whether
poor adherence to the SBTLOV diet reduced the ob-
served effects of the vegetarian diet, we conducted a sub-
group analysis of the SBTLOV subjects, comparing those
who were 100% adherent (no meat, fish, or poultry con-
sumed) according to the Three-Day Food Record to those
who were not 100% adherent (ate some meat, fish, or
poultry).
Table 3 shows the demographic characteristics of the two
SBTLOV groups by adherence (100% adherent vs.
100% adherent). Employment status, age, and education
did not differ significantly between groups. However, a
significant difference was seen in sex (p  0.045); none of
the eight male subjects was 100% adherent to the LOV
diet. Significant differences were also seen in race (p 
0.053) and marital status (p  0.020) between the two
adherence groups; a higher proportion of the 100% adherent
subjects was white, and a higher proportion was married.
The mean values of the baseline and 6-month measure-
ments for both of the SBTLOV adherence groups (100%
adherent vs. 100% adherent) are shown in Table 4. Com-
pared with those who were 100% adherent, those who
were 100% adherent lost more weight (p  0.001), had a
greater reduction in BMI (p  0.001), consumed less fat

(p  0.030) and fewer carbohydrates (p  0.005), and
experienced greater reductions in total cholesterol (p 
0.026), LDL-C (p  0.034), and glucose (p  0.002).
Figure 2 shows the LDL-C change scores for participants in
the SBT, SBTLOV 100% adherent, and SBTLOV
100% adherent groups.
Compared with SBTLOV subjects who continued to
eat some meat, fish, or poultry meals, subjects who were
100% adherent to the vegetarian diet were significantly
more likely to identify themselves as vegetarians (p 
0.001) on the Identity as a Vegetarian Questionnaire. Highly
significant differences were found between SBTLOV ad-
herence groups in most questions (all except two questions
regarding nutrition, one regarding affordability, one regard-
ing ethics, and one regarding others’ respect for the vege-
tarian diet). When the scores were averaged to provide an
overall identity score, the subjects who were 100% adherent
scored significantly higher than those who were 100%
adherent (7.7 vs. 5.0 of 10 questions, p  0.001).
Discussion
The PREFER study, to the best of our knowledge, is the
first randomized controlled trial examining an LOV eating
plan as part of a weight loss study. The sample included
male and female adults across a wide BMI range (27 to 43)
and had approximately a 30% representation of minority
groups. Generally, men do not respond to weight loss stud-
ies in large numbers, and this study is no exception. The
small percentage of male subjects may have been attribut-
able to the potential to be prescribed an LOV diet. However,
even at 12.6%, this sample included more men than are
generally reported in weight loss studies, and the men in the
SBTLOV group were 100% adherent to the vegetarian
diet. Nonetheless, because the obesity epidemic is not re-
stricted to women, and a recent article reported increased
prevalence among men (5), future weight loss studies need
to consider recruitment strategies that will increase male
representation.
Subjects in both diet groups benefited from the first 6
months of the behavioral intervention in that they reduced
their weight by 7%, which results in clinically significant
improvements, e.g., reduced risk of insulin resistance and
type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and inflamma-
tion. In fact, many of these metabolic benefits occur with
only 5% weight loss and continue to improve with increas-
ing weight loss (4,19). These improvements over time with

weight loss were observed in both groups, e.g., reduced
values in most of the biological variables from baseline to 6
months.
Nine percent of the SBTLOV group was on lipid-
lowering drug therapy at baseline, and the percentage was
reduced to 7% at 6 months; at baseline and at 6 months, 2%
of the SBT group was on lipid-lowering drug therapy. When
we examined LDL-C over time, there was a significant
difference between the two groups, with the SBTLOV
lowering their LDL and the SBT group showing a slight
LDL increase. The fact that three fewer subjects in the
SBTLOV group were on drug therapy at 6 months and yet
the mean LDL-C level was reduced might suggest that the
dietary change contributed to the reduction.
Because the intervention was the same for both groups
for all aspects of the study except for the elimination of
meat, fish, and poultry, we did not expect to observe dif-
ferences between the groups in their reported physical ac-
tivity and exercise. Indeed, the groups reported similar
levels of physical activity. Similarly, except for animal
products, there were no differences in the consumed ma-
cronutrients reported by the two groups.
The differences between diet groups were minimal, pos-
sibly because the SBTLOV group included individuals
who
were
not
following
the
vegetarian
diet.
When
SBTLOV individuals were analyzed separately, those
who were 100% adherent to the vegetarian diet were more
successful at both weight loss and cholesterol reduction,
which suggests that vegetarian diets are efficacious for
weight and cholesterol control. As in the findings of Bar-
nard et al. (11), the subjects in the SBTLOV groups, on
average, were nearly 100% compliant to their daily fat goal
(25% of calories from fat), whereas the SBT group con-
sumed 27% of their calories from fat. Because this analysis
was limited to the 6-month time-point, we cannot report the
effect of the LOV diet on long-term adherence or weight
loss maintenance. Similar to what has been reported by
others, the SBTLOV group had greater reductions in
LDL-C (12,13,16). Rolls et al. (20) reported significant
changes in weight by regularly substituting a food that is
low in energy density for one that is high in energy density
without restricting calories. We prescribed the same caloric
and fat restrictions for both diet groups. It is not clear
whether those who were adherent to the LOV diet experi-
enced greater satiety from eating foods with reduced energy
density; however, this warrants further study.
Subjects who were adherent to the LOV diet experienced
significant improvements in several physical and biological
outcome measures. Married participants were more adher-
ent to the LOV diet, which might suggest that support plays
a role. Most participants reported that their spouse was not
willing to adopt the LOV diet but was supportive; however,
some of the participants’ adolescent to adult children shared
the dietary changes with the parent. The African-American
participants were less adherent than white participants,
which might suggest that cultural differences in dietary
practices and in food preferences were deterrents to main-
taining the LOV diet. General approaches to enhance ad-
herence might include the development of more practical
skills in preparing vegetarian dishes, introducing a greater
variety of foods, and adapting dishes to different cultural
preferences. Individuals who seemed more adventurous in
food preparation and eating seemed to adapt recipes and
make food substitutions better. Some participants reported
having difficulty eating in restaurants or being tired of
having pasta and marinara sauce, which may change as
more restaurants add more diverse vegetarian options to
their menus. Although we provided numerous tastings to
expose participants to new foods, they did not always adopt
these new foods. It might have helped if we had conducted
more tastings or provided more homemade rather than pack-
aged foods. An important issue is personal preference. In-
dividuals changed their preferences while in the study; e.g.,
some entered wishing to become vegetarian and changed
their mind after trying it, whereas others who were random-
ized to the LOV diet group resisted initially but converted
after experiencing positive results in their health and how
they felt. This was probably the most influential factor in
adherence. Thus, it would be important to use this dietary
option with those who are willing to make significant
changes in their diet.
