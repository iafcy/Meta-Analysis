ABSTRACT
Objective: Evidence suggests that both Mediterranean and vegan diets improve body weight and
cardiometabolic risk factors, but their relative efficacy has not been compared in a random-
ized trial.
Methods: In a randomized crossover trial, 62 overweight adults were randomly assigned to a
Mediterranean or vegan diet for a 16-week period. Body weight, plasma lipids, blood pressure,
and body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. Secondary measures included
insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment, HOMA-IR), oral glucose insulin sensitivity
(OGIS), and predicted insulin sensitivity (PREDIM) indices. Thereafter, participants were asked to
return to their baseline diets for 4 weeks, after which they began the opposite diet for 16 weeks.
The same parameters were measured before and after this 2nd 16-week period.
Results: Overall net weight changes were 0.0 (Mediterranean) and 6.0 kg (vegan), (treatment
effect 6.0 kg [95% CI 7.5 to 4.5]; p < 0.001). HOMA-IR decreased and OGIS increased on the
vegan diet with no significant change on the Mediterranean diet (treatment effect 0.7 [95% CI,
1.8 to þ0.4]; p ¼ 0.21; and þ35.8 mL/min/m2 [95% CI, þ13.2 to þ58.3]; p ¼ 0.003, respectively).
PREDIM did not change significantly in either group. Among participants with no medication
changes, total and LDL-cholesterol decreased 18.7 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L) and 15.3 mg/dL (0.4 mmol/
L), respectively, on the vegan diet, compared with no significant change on the Mediterranean
diet (treatment effect 15.6 [-24.6 to 6.6]; p ¼ 0.001 and 14.8 [-23.5 to 6.2]; p ¼ 0.001,
respectively); systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased 9.3 and 7.3 mmHg
on the
Mediterranean diet, compared with 3.4 and 4.1 mmHg on the vegan diet (treatment effect þ5.9
[95% CI þ1.0 to þ10.9]; p ¼ 0.02; and þ1.8 [95% CI 4.6 to þ8.1]; p ¼ 0.58, respectively).
Conclusions: A low-fat vegan diet improved body weight, lipid concentrations, and insulin sensi-
tivity, both from baseline and compared with a Mediterranean diet. Blood pressure decreased on
both diets, more on the Mediterranean diet.

Introduction
Excess body weight and cardiovascular disease are major
worldwide health problems. Approximately 70% of US
adults are overweight (1), and nearly half have cardiovascu-
lar disease (including coronary heart disease, heart failure,
stroke or hypertension) (2).
Mediterranean and vegan diets have long been studied
for their effects on body weight and cardiometabolic risk.
While a “Mediterranean diet” can refer to a variety of culin-
ary traditions, the term has been codified for research pur-
poses to refer to a diet that includes abundant plant-based
foods, favors olive oil as the primary source of fat, and
includes low to moderate amounts of meat, dairy products,
eggs,
and
wine
(3).

cardiovascular event was reduced by approximately 30% in
the groups following a Mediterranean diet supplemented
with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts, compared with an
untreated control group (4).
The effect of such a diet on body weight is less clear. A
2016 systematic review (5) reported that clinical trials using
Mediterranean
diets
showed
significant
weight
loss.
However, all 5 reviewed studies included either added exer-
cise or calorie restriction, confounding the effects of the
dietary change. A later randomized trial reported significant
weight loss with a Mediterranean diet, but the study also
included a substantial energy restriction and physical exer-
cise (6). In the Lyon Diet Heart Study (7), a Mediterranean
diet supplemented with an alpha-linolenic-acid-rich margar-
ine reduced cardiac deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tions
in
individuals
who
had
survived
a
myocardial
infarction but led to a small weight gain (1.4 kg) during the
2-year study, rather than weight loss (8). In the PREDIMED
study, although 90% of participants had excess body weight
at baseline (9), weight loss over the first 3 study months was
only 0.19 kg in the olive oil-supplemented group and 0.26 kg
in the nut-supplemented group (4).
In epidemiologic studies, individuals following vegan
diets tend to have lower body weights (10) and fewer cardio-
vascular disease risk factors (11), compared with individuals
following other dietary patterns. In a meta-analysis of 15
clinical trials, prescription of vegetarian diets was associated
with a mean weight loss among study completers of 4.6 kg
(12). In a separate meta-analysis of 12 clinical trials includ-
ing 1151 participants, weight change among participants fol-
lowing a vegan diet was 2.52 kg (95% CI 3.02 to 1.98)
(13). In randomized studies, a low-fat plant-based diet
improves body weight (12), plasma lipids (14), blood pres-
sure (15), and glycemic control (16).
Mediterranean and vegan diets are variations on a theme:
one favors plant-based foods; the other consists of plant
products
exclusively.
The
European
Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Physical Activity,
Nutrition, Alcohol Consumption, Cessation of Smoking,
Eating
out
of
Home,
and
Obesity
(EPIC-PANACEA)
reported that the only aspect of a Mediterranean diet that
was associated with protection from weight gain was the
avoidance of meat products (17). In the PREDIMED study,
a sub-analysis revealed that, the more participants followed
a plant-based dietary pattern, the lower their risk of cardio-
vascular events (18).
None of these studies has examined the relative effects of
a Mediterranean and low-fat vegan diet for improving body
weight or altering cardiovascular risk factors. Such a study
would require random assignment of individuals to these
diets followed by a detailed examination of their effects, but
no such study has been done. There is particular value to a
cross-over study design in which two diets are tested, not in
similar individuals, but in precisely the same individuals.
Such studies require careful analysis, however, because the
physical effects of the diet presented first will necessarily
influence the experience of the second diet in such a way
that even an extended wash-out period cannot overcome.
To take advantage of the statistical power of a crossover
design, it is therefore essential to adjust for differences in
body weight and other parameters that have occurred over
the course of the study.
The present study directly compared a Mediterranean
and a vegan diet for their effects on weight and cardiometa-
bolic parameters, using a cross-over design. Based on the
findings of prior studies, it tested the hypothesis that, com-
pared with a Mediterranean diet, a low-fat vegan diet results
in greater changes in body weight, total and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations, and insulin sensitivity.
Materials and methods
Study design and eligibility
The intervention was conducted between February and
October 2019 in Washington, DC. Adults with a body mass
index between 28 and 40 kg/m2, were enrolled. Exclusion
criteria were type 1 diabetes, smoking, alcohol or drug
abuse, pregnancy or lactation, and current use of a vegan or
Mediterranean diet.
Randomization and study groups
Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to two
groups. Group 1 was to begin a Mediterranean diet, and
Group
2
was
to
begin
a
low-fat
vegan
diet,
both
for 16 weeks.
The Mediterranean diet followed the PREDIMED proto-
col (4). Participants were asked to consume 2 daily serv-
ings of vegetables, 2-3 daily servings of fresh fruits, 3
weekly servings of legumes, 3 weekly servings of fish or
shellfish, and 3 weekly servings of nuts or seeds, and to
select white meats (with visible fat removed) instead of red
meats. Participants were asked to limit or eliminate cream,
butter, margarine, processed meats, sweetened beverages,
pastries, and processed snacks. Nuts, eggs, fish and shellfish,
low-fat cheese, chocolate (50% cocoa) and whole-grain
cereals could be consumed ad libitum. Cured ham, red
meat, and fatty cheeses were limited to 1 serving per week.
Participants were asked to use extra virgin olive oil instead
of other fats or oils in food preparation, using 50 g per day
as part of (not in addition to) their regular food intake.
The low-fat vegan diet (75% of energy from carbohy-
drates, 15% protein, and 10% fat) consisted of vegetables,
grains, legumes, and fruits. Participants were instructed to
avoid animal products and added fats. No meals were pro-
vided. Vitamin B12 was supplemented (500 mg/day) during
the vegan phase of the study.
For both diets, no limitations were placed on energy
intake. Alcoholic beverages were limited to one per day for
women and two per day for men. All study participants
were asked not to alter their exercise habits and to continue
their preexisting medication regimens for the study dur-
ation, except as modified by their personal physicians.
Participants were asked to attend weekly classes of identi-
cal intensity but with content appropriate for their respective
2

diets. Classes covered food preparation, maintaining the
assigned diet while traveling or dining at restaurants, and
various health topics, were led by registered dietitians, physi-
cians, or other study personnel with particular expertise in
the respective diets.
A 3-day dietary record was completed by each participant
at baseline and week 16. Dietary intake data were collected
and analyzed by a Registered Dietitian or a staff member
certified in Nutrition Data System for Research version 2018
(Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN) (19). Physical activity was assessed by the
International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (20).
Outcomes
All measurements were performed at baseline and week 16
after a 10 h overnight fast.
Body weight and composition
Height (baseline only) and weight were measured using a
stadiometer and a calibrated scale accurate to 0.1 kg, respect-
ively. Body composition was measured by dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare; Madison, WI)
with EncoreV
R 2005 v.9.15.010 software, equipped with the
CoreScan module (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI) to measure
visceral adipose tissue volume.
Blood lipids
Plasma lipid concentrations were measured by enzymatic
colorimetric methods (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).
Insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance
Insulin secretion and glucose tolerance were assessed after
stimulation with a liquid breakfast (Boost Plus, Nestle,
Vevey, Switzerland; 720 kcal, 34% of energy from fat, 16%
protein, 50% carbohydrate). Plasma concentrations of glu-
cose, immunoreactive insulin, and C-peptide were measured
at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. Serum glucose was analyzed
using the Hexokinase UV endpoint method (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland). Plasma immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide
concentrations were determined using insulin and C-peptide
electro-chemiluminescence
immunoassay
(ECLIA)
kits
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). HbA1c was measured by tur-
bidimetric
inhibition
immunoassay
(Roche,
Basel,
Switzerland).
Insulin
resistance
was
calculated
using
HOMA-IR (The homeostasis model assessment) index (21).
Oral glucose insulin sensitivity index was calculated as a
measure of dynamic postprandial insulin sensitivity (22).
PREDIM index, previously validated against clamp-derived
measures of insulin sensitivity (23), was calculated as a
measure of dynamic postprandial insulin sensitivity.
After the 16-week point, participants were asked to
return to their customary eating habits for four weeks, then
to begin the opposite diet (those initially randomized to the
Mediterranean diet were asked to begin the vegan diet and
vice versa) for 16 weeks with the same weekly classes and
outcome assessments before and after this period.
Ethics
The
study
protocol
was
approved
by
the
Advarra
Institutional Review Board in Columbia, MD, USA, on
September
20,
2018
(protocol
identification
number
Pro00029777). The trial was prospectively registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT03698955). All participants gave
written informed consent.
Power analysis
Based on previous studies and with an alpha-level 0.05, the
expected changes in body weight were 0.3 (95% CI 0.61
to 0.09) kg on the Mediterranean diet and 6.5 (95% CI
8.9 to 4.1) kg on the low-fat vegan diet in 16 weeks. For
90% power to detect a significant treatment effect, we
needed 24 participants to complete both interventions in a
cross-over fashion. Assuming an attrition of 20%, the
required sample size was 30 total for 90% power.
Statistical analysis
While a cross-over design provides technical advantages, it
requires specific statistical operations. The primary analysis
included all participants with available data for the four
evaluation timepoints for each outcome analyzed. A cross-
over ANOVA model was used with between-subject and
within-subject
factors
and
interactions.
Factors
diet
(Mediterranean and vegan), subject, time (week), period (1
and 2) were included in the model for participants with
complete data.
Evidence of a carryover effect between the two treatment
periods was evaluated for each outcome by assessing the sig-
nificance of an interaction between period and initial treat-
ment assignment in a linear mixed model of the outcome
with treatment and period as fixed effects and participant as
a random effect, fit for participants with complete data. For
all variables for which this interaction was not statistically
significant, the magnitude and significance of treatment
effect were then evaluated using a one-sample t-test (two-
sided with alpha level of 0.05) evaluating differences between
change in outcome when on the vegan diet versus change in
outcome when on the Mediterranean diet for all participants
with complete data. For any outcomes with evidence of a
carryover effect, estimated treatment effect for the first
period of the trial alone was deemed the more appropriate.
Within each group, paired comparison t-tests were calcu-
lated to test whether the changes from baseline to 16 weeks
in each treatment period were statistically significant. The
statistician was blinded to the hypothesized effects of inter-
ventions and group assignment. Results are presented as
means with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Demographic characteristics are listed in Table 1. There
were no significant differences between the groups.
Four participants dropped out during a vegan phase and six
dropped out during a Mediterranean phase, mostly for reasons
unrelated to the study, leaving 52 (84%) study completers.
Dietary intake
Dietary intake, physical activity, and cardiometabolic out-
comes are presented in Table 2. Changes in the first and
second study periods separately, as well as tests for a carry-
over
effect
(indicating
non-consistent
treatment
effects
observed in the two periods) are presented in Table 3.
From the analysis of the full crossover study shown in
Table 2, self-reported energy intake decreased on the vegan
diet by 500 kcal/day (p < 0.001) but did not change signifi-
cantly on the Mediterranean diet. The percentage of energy
consumed from fat decreased on the vegan diet (p < 0.001)
but increased on the Mediterranean diet (p < 0.001), mainly
due to increased monounsaturated fat intake (p < 0.001).
Energy from carbohydrates increased on the vegan diet (p
< 0.001)
and
decreased
on
the
Mediterranean
diet

Data shown are means and estimated treatment effects with 95% confidence intervals. The treatment effect is the mean (average) difference between participant outcomes on the vegan versus the Mediterranean diet,
and the P-value in the rightmost column is from a one-sample t-test assessing whether this mean within-participant difference is different from zero. p < 0.05, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 for paired comparison
t-tests assessing whether within-group changes from baseline are different from zero.
# For physical activity and systolic blood pressure in all study participants, including those with changes in antihypertensive medications, the carryover effect was statistically significant. Therefeore, the values from
the first study phase may be considered as more valid (see Table 3).

< 0.001). Fiber intake increased on both diets, but more so
on the vegan diet (p < 0.001). The treatment effect was
highly statistically significant for all dietary intake factors
examined, except alcohol intake.
On the vegan diet, final 3-day dietary records showed
that 42/52 participants (81%) reported avoiding all animal
products, 49/52 participants (94%) consistently consumed
less than 50 mg cholesterol a day, and 46/52 (86%) con-
sumed less than 25% energy from fat and less than 5%
energy from saturated fat. On the Mediterranean diet, 38/52
(73%) consumed 2 or more servings of vegetables per day
and 49/52 participants (94%) consumed olive oil as the
main culinary fat.
Medication changes during the study
Despite the request that medications remain constant, 7 par-
ticipants reduced or discontinued lipid-lowering medications
during vegan diet phases, 2 did so during Mediterranean
diet phases, and 1 increased them in a Mediterranean diet
phase. Similarly, 7 participants reduced or discontinued
anti-hypertensive medications during vegan phases; 6 did so
during Mediterranean phases. One participant increased
these medications during a vegan phase; 1 did so during a
Mediterranean phase.
Body weight and body composition
During the initial 16-week period, mean weight change was
1.5 (-2.9 to þ0.02) kg on the Mediterranean diet and 7.9
(-9.3 to 6.5) kg on the vegan diet. In the second study
period, mean weight change was þ1.4 (þ0.4 to þ2.3) kg on
the Mediterranean diet and 4.0 (-5.6 to 2.4) kg on the
vegan diet (see Figure 1 and Table 3). There was no evi-
dence of a difference in treatment effect for weight change
between the two periods (p ¼ 0.45 for carryover effect).
Overall, mean body weight decreased 6.0 kg on the vegan
diet, compared with no mean change on the Mediterranean
diet (treatment effect 6.0 kg [95% CI 7.5 to 4.5]; p
< 0.001). Most of the vegan-phase weight change was attrib-
utable to a reduction in fat mass and visceral fat volume
(treatment effect 3.4 kg [95% CI 4.7 to 2.2]; p < 0.001;
and 314.5 cm3 [95% CI 446.7 to 182.4]; p < 0.001,
respectively). Of the 52 study completers, 26 lost weight dur-
ing the Mediterranean phase, compared with 48 participants
during the vegan phase (see Supplemental Figure 2).
On the Mediterranean diet, weight changes were associ-
ated with changes in fiber intake (r¼0.30; p ¼ 0.02), par-
ticularly insoluble fiber (r¼0.31; p ¼ 0.02). On the vegan
diet, weight loss was associated with reduction in energy
intake (r¼ þ0.37; p ¼ 0.007) and decrease in total fat con-
sumption (r¼ þ0.47; p < 0.001), particularly saturated fat
(r¼ þ0.40; p ¼ 0.003).

[95% CI, þ13.2 to þ58.3]; p ¼ 0.003, respectively). PREDIM
did not change significantly on either treatment (Table 2).
Lipids and blood pressure
Among participants with no changes in lipid-lowering medi-
cations (n ¼ 43), total and LDL-cholesterol decreased 3.1 mg/
dL (0.08 mmol/L) and 0.5 mg/dL (0.01 mmol/L), respectively,
during the Mediterranean phase, compared with 18.7 mg/dL
(0.5 mmol/L)
and
15.3 mg/dL
(0.4 mmol/L),
respectively,
during the vegan phase.
Among participants with no changes to anti-hypertensive
medications (n ¼ 41), systolic and diastolic blood pressure
decreased
9.3
and
7.3 mmHg,
respectively,
on
the
Mediterranean diet and 3.4 and 4.1 mmHg, respectively, on
the vegan diet (treatment effect, systolic, þ6.0 [95% CI þ1.0
to þ10.9]; p ¼ 0.02; diastolic, þ3.2 [95% CI 0.0 to þ6.4];
p ¼ 0.048).
The effect of period 1 vs. 2
Improvements in most cardiometabolic outcomes were more
pronounced on both diets during the first study period (rep-
resenting the change from baseline) than the second study
period (reflecting the change from the previous diet and
washout period) (Table 3). The interaction test for a carry-
over effect, which would reflect inconsistency of estimated
treatment effects between the first and second study period,
was not statistically significant for most outcomes, indicating
statistical validity of the treatment effects in Table 2 esti-
mated using the entire crossover study data. The two out-
comes with potential carryover effect were physical activity
and systolic blood pressure (the latter only when evaluated
among all participants, including those with antihypertensive
medication changes).
Discussion
In the first 16 weeks of the study, a low-fat vegan diet led to
greater reductions in body weight (by 6.4 kg), fat mass (by
3.8 kg),
visceral
fat
(by
429 cm3)
compared
with
a
Mediterranean diet, with no difference in blood lipids and
blood pressure between the treatments. Evaluating the data
from the whole 36-week cross-over trial, a low-fat vegan
diet led to greater reductions in body weight (by 6.0 kg), fat
mass (by 3.4 kg), visceral fat (by 315 cm3) and plasma lipid
concentrations compared with a Mediterranean diet, while
both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased more on
the Mediterranean diet (by 6.0 and 3.2 mmHg, respectively).
We observed no carryover effect for most variables, except
for physical activity and systolic blood pressure (when eval-
uated among all participants including those with antihyper-
tensive medication changes). For these two outcomes, the
estimated first-period-only treatment effects in Table 3 may
be viewed as potentially more valid.
With regard to body weight, it is important to note that
despite the fact that neither diet was energy-restricted, par-
ticipants reduced energy intake on the low-fat vegan diet
compared with the Mediterranean diet. The present study
confirms the findings of the Lyon and PREDIMED studies,
suggesting that a Mediterranean diet, as delivered in these

trials, is not effective for weight loss. This may have been
attributable, in part, to the fact that these trials did not actu-
ally mirror a traditional Mediterranean diet. Keys’ studies of
Mediterranean diets used as a point of reference the south-
ern Italian village of Nicotera, where only 23% of typical
energy consumption was derived from fat (5, 24). The Lyon
and PREDIMED studies used artificial diets, emphasizing
margarine and fish (Lyon Study, with a reported fat intake
of 30.4% of energy in the experimental group) (8) or fish,
oil, and/or nuts (PREDIMED, with a reported fat intake of
41% and 42% of energy in the olive oil and nut groups,
respectively); it may be that the presence of energy-dense
fish and other animal products, along with oil or nuts,
counteracted
weight-loss
efforts.
The
present
study’s
Mediterranean intervention followed the PREDIMED guide-
lines, with similar results for body weight.
The low-fat vegan diet led to significant weight loss, con-
firming the findings of prior studies (12). Clinical trials sug-
gest that plant-based diets reduce body weight by two
concurrent mechanisms. First, a reduction in dietary fat and
increase in fiber lead to a reduction in dietary energy dens-
ity, which reduces energy intake (25). This reduction in
energy intake occurs despite the fact that the diet was ad
libitum, as was the Mediterranean diet. Second, a low-fat
vegan diet increases postprandial energy expenditure. The
thermic effect of food—i.e., the increased energy expenditure
that comes from processing and storing food—accounts for
approximately 10% of total energy expenditure. In a study
of postmenopausal women, the thermic effect of food, as
measured by indirect calorimetry using a standard test meal,
was 16% higher after 14 weeks on a low-fat, vegan diet (26).
Similar results were achieved in overweight men and women
after 16 weeks of a low-fat, vegan diet, where the thermic
effect of food increased by 14% compared with the control
group (27). In turn, this increased energy expenditure may
reflect changes in mitochondrial action. In a 2005 study, a
high-fat (50% of energy) diet, followed for 3 days, led to a
downregulation of the genes required for mitochondrial oxi-
dative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle (28). Similarly, a
2015 study showed that a high-fat diet may facilitate the
passage of bacterial endotoxins through the gut wall (29). In
turn, endotoxins appeared to impair postprandial cellular
glucose oxidation. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies
show that a low-fat vegan diet reduces hepatocellular and
intramyocellular lipid concentrations and increases insulin
sensitivity, thereby increasing energy expenditure in the
postprandial period (27). Together, these findings suggest
high-fat diets may disrupt postprandial energy expenditure,
while low-fat, plant-based diets may have the opposite effect.
A
transition
from
a
typical
Western
diet
to
a
Mediterranean-style diet typically improves plasma lipid
concentrations by virtue of reduced intake of saturated fat
and
cholesterol.
In
the
Medi-RIVAGE
study,
a
Mediterranean-style diet led to a greater reduction in LDL-
cholesterol concentrations, compared with a control group
following a diet intended to limit fat to 30% of energy (in
practice, fat intake was 34% of energy) (30). Likewise, partic-
ipants in the PREDIMED study following Mediterranean
diets also improved their LDL-cholesterol more than the
control group (4). Small reductions in total cholesterol
(-0.16 mmol/L)
and
LDL-cholesterol
(-0.07 mmol/L)
in
response to a Mediterranean diet were demonstrated in a
meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (31).
In the present study, the LDL-cholesterol reduction in
response to the low-fat vegan diet was significantly greater
than that observed with the Mediterranean diet, reflecting
the fact that, while the Mediterranean diet reduced the per-
centage of energy from saturated fat, the vegan diet reduced
it significantly more, along with an effective elimination of
cholesterol intake. In a 2015 meta-analysis of 11 clinical tri-
als, vegetarian diets reduced total and LDL-cholesterol by
14 mg/dL
(0.36 mmol/L)
and
13 mg/dL
(0.34 mmol/L),
respectively (14). Similarly, in a 2017 meta-analysis of 19
clinical trials, vegetarian diets reduced total and LDL-choles-
terol
by
12.5 mg/dL
(0.32 mmol/L)
and
12.2 mg/dL
(0.32 mmol/L), respectively (32).
The systolic-blood-pressure-lowering effect was greater
with the Mediterranean diet, which may be attributable to
its high content of monounsaturated fat and vitamin E, and
virgin olive oil’s ability to increase antioxidant capacity
(33–35). A randomized trial in 164 adults with prehyperten-
sion demonstrated that partial substitution of carbohydrate
with monounsaturated fat modestly reduced blood pressure
(34). In the PREDIMED study, participants allocated to
either of the two Mediterranean diet groups, with extra vir-
gin olive oil or with nuts, had significantly lower diastolic
blood pressure than the participants in the control group
(36). Four tablespoons of olive oil provide 52% of the rec-
ommended dietary allowance of vitamin E. Vitamin E has
been shown to increase oxidative resistance and the con-
sumption of foods rich in vitamin E has been associated
with lower risk of coronary heart disease (35). A 3-year
randomized clinical study showed that a Mediterranean diet
rich in olive oil was associated with high levels of plasma
antioxidant capacity (33).
Plant-based diets also reduce blood pressure, presumably
due to reductions in blood viscosity and body weight, and
their high potassium content (37). In a meta-analysis of 7
clinical trials using vegetarian and vegan diets, systolic blood
pressure was reduced by 4.8 mm Hg and diastolic blood
pressure by 2.2 mm Hg (15).
In research studies, the acceptability of plant-based diets
is similar to that of other therapeutic diets over both the
short and long term, as indicated by rates of retention, diet
adherence,
and
diet
acceptance
questionnaires
(38–41).
Likewise, self-reports and objective measures indicate gener-
ally good adherence to the Mediterranean diet (4).
This study has several strengths, including a methodo-
logically efficient cross-over design and weekly participant
follow-up to facilitate dietary adherence. Despite the length
of the trial, retention was reasonably strong (84%). Because
the participants were not confined to a metabolic ward, the
results can readily translate to nonclinical settings.
The study also has limitations. Although self-reported
overall adherence to both diets was high, it is impossible to
eliminate uncertainty regarding participants’ adherence. The

improvements in most cardiometabolic outcomes were more
pronounced on both diets during the first study period (rep-
resenting the change from baseline) than the second study
period, largely because baseline mean body weight was
higher than that after the washout period. Nonetheless,
weight loss was observed on the vegan diet in both phases
of the study with no carryover effect. Self-reported energy
intake was lower on both diets in the first period compared
to the second one, however, as noted above, estimates of
treatment effect were in general largely consistent between
the two study periods. While the study duration was suffi-
cient to allow the participants to experience metabolic
changes, a longer duration would have provided more evi-
dence about the long-term cardiometabolic effects of both
diets. Metabolic adaptation to changes in macronutrient
intake, particularly to lower carbohydrate intake, has been
previously shown to be affected by the study duration. In a
meta-analysis of 29 trials testing the effects of diets varying
in carbohydrate content, total energy expenditure appeared
to require approximately 2.5 weeks to respond to the dietary
intervention and other metabolic measures may take longer,
suggesting value of studies with longer durations (42).
In conclusion, this 36-week randomized cross-over trial
showed that a low-fat plant-based diet reduced body weight,
fat mass, and visceral fat, increased insulin sensitivity, and
improved blood lipids, compared with a Mediterranean diet.
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased more on the
Mediterranean diet.
