ABSTRACT 
The Women's Lifestyle Heart Trial was a small (N = 28) 
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a comprehen- 
sive lifestyle self-management program (very low-fat vegetarian 
diet, stress-management training, exercise, group support, and 
smoking cessation) on reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in 
postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (CHD). 
Women assigned to the treatment condition (Prime Time) partici- 
pated in a week-long retreat followed by twice-weekly 4-hour 
meetings. Endpoints were program adherence; changes in lipid 
profiles, body mass, blood pressure, hypolipidemic and antihyper- 
tensive medications; and quality of life. Risk factor and psychoso- 
cial evaluations were conducted at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 
months. Repeated measures analyses of covariance revealed that 
the dietary, stress management, and physical activity changes 
made by intervention women were dramatic and lasting. There 
were significantly greater improvements in the Prime Time condi- 
tion compared to the usual care control group on body mass, 
angina symptoms, and quality of life, and a tendency for a greater 
reduction in blood pressure-lowering medications. Similar pat- 
terns were seen in lipids, blood pressure, and lipid-lowering 
medications, but did not reach significance. These results demon- 
strate that postmenopausal CHD women can make lasting lifestyle 
changes, and that these changes may reduce the need for cardiac 
medications and improve CHD risk factors and quality of life.

236,574 deaths in females and approximately 197,680 (75%) 
mortalities per year among postmenopausal females (2,3). Exclu- 
sion of females, especially older women, from CHD research has 
been commonplace (4). Relatively little research has focused on 
strategies to promote healthier lifestyles for women with CHD (5). 
Of the reports on treatment of CHD that have included women, 
most have focused on drug therapy and invasive interventions such 
as coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty (6). Resource 
intensive technologies such as coronary bypass surgery have 
become focal points for the debate over cost control and adequate 
access to health care (7). Strategies to promote healthier lifestyles 
for health care consumers--as opposed to surgical or medical 
procedures--may ultimately reduce the use of medical services 
and help to contain costs, as well as prevent initial or recurrent 
heart attacks (8). 
There is convincing evidence that improvements in lifestyle 
behaviors, which include smoking cessation (9), diet (10), exercise 
(11), and stress management (12,13), can reduce further heart 
disease problems. However, it is clear that an individual's risk for 
developing heart disease is not a result of one risk factor in 
isolation, but rather a product of a complex set of risk factors, and 
the contribution of each to overall risk varies from person to person 
(14,15). While available data strongly implicate the contribution of 
these risk factors to heart disease, investigations aimed at interven- 
ing simultaneously on combinations of factors are practically 
nonexistent (13,16-18). 
Few investigators (19-23) have studied a comprehensive 
lifestyle program for treating CHD. Compared to their control 
group counterparts, patients participating in these studies have 
generally had slower rates of progression, and even regression, of 
coronary lesions. Ornish et al. (24) performed a prospective 
randomized controlled trial of multiple lifestyle changes versus 
usual care in patients with clinically manifest coronary disease. 
The Comprehensive Lifestyle Program (CLP) consisted of a very 
low-fat diet, smoking cessation, stress-management training, mod- 
erate aerobic exercise, and group support. Of 48 patients random- 
ized to experimental or control groups, 41 had undergone repeat 
coronary arteriography at Year 1. Their average percent diameter 
stenosis regressed from 40.0% to 37.8% in the experimental group 
and progressed from 42.7% to 46.1% in the control group 
(p < 0.001). 
The purpose of the PrimeTime program was to develop and 
evaluate an intervention to improve self-care and reduce secondary 
CHD risk among postmenopausal CHD women, using the proce- 
dures developed by Ornish (13,25) for the Lifestyle Heart Trial. 
This report presents the effects of the PrimeTime program on 
lowering cardiovascular risk factors and improving quality of life 
in these women.

METHODS 
Study Design and Participants 
The PrimeTime program was promoted extensively among 
local physicians and through presentations, mailings, individual 
meetings, and the local media. Persons interested in the project 
called to receive a description of the project and to determine 
eligibility. Eligibility requirements included being a postmeno- 
pansal female and having documented CHD defined as atheroscle- 
rosis, myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous transluminal coro- 
nary angioplasty, and/or coronary bypass graft surgery. Exclusion 
criteria employed by Ornish et al. (24,25), including having other 
life-threatening illnesses, infarction during the preceding 6 weeks, 
receiving streptokinase or alteplase, or being scheduled for bypass 
surgery, were used. CHD documentation and permission from 
one's primary care physician and cardiologist were required. 
Participants completing baseline assessment (75% of those express- 
ing interest and eligible) were stratified and then randomized to 
either the PrimeTime program or to usual care (UC). Stratification 
was by: (a) total/HDL cholesterol ratios of greater than versus less 
than 6.0, (b) smoking status, and (c) presence or absence of 
diabetes. Since these are major risk factors for CHD in women and 
given the small sample size, we anticipated that a predominance of 
one of these risk factors in either the treatment or control group 
could overpower the effects of the intervention. Participants were 
assessed at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 months. 
PrimeTime Intervention 
Participants randomized to the PrimeTime program began the 
intervention with a 7-day retreat (24). Each woman was encour- 
aged to bring her spouse or a support partner who had agreed to 
assist her in carrying out the program. The daily schedule for the 
retreat included cooking classes, and meals were planned by the 
project dietician to follow the Reversal Diet (13) guidelines (e.g. 
vegetarian, less than 10% calories from fat). 
Study participants received instruction in, and had an opportu- 
nity to practice, stress-management techniques twice per day 
during the retreat led by a certified Yoga instructor. The stress- 
management techniques included Hatha Yoga stretches, progres- 
sive deep relaxation, deep breathing, meditation, and directed or 
receptive imagery (i.e. visualizing improvements occurring in the 
heart). The women were asked to practice these techniques 1 hour 
per day and were given audiocassette tapes to assist them. 
Daily group physical activity sessions included warm-up, 
walking or aerobics, and a cool-down led by an American College 
of Sports Medicine certified exercise physiologist. Participants 
were individually prescribed exercise intensity based on their 
treadmill exercise test performance. Following the retreat, the 
intervention exercise program required participants to engage in a 
1-hour session per day at least 3 days each week. 
Retreat evenings ended with small, relatively unstructured 
group sessions for sharing feelings. Participants discussed difficul- 
ties with program components and emotional issues as they arose, 
practiced communication skills, and engaged in exercises to build 
group support and decrease feelings of social isolation. Group 
leaders emphasized unconditional positive regard and encouraged 
participants to share feelings rather than thoughts and to refrain 
from offering advice. 
Twice-weekly 4-hour meetings followed the retreat. Each 
meeting followed a sequence similar to the retreat schedule: (a) 
supervised exercise training, (b) Yoga and relaxation led by a 
trained instructor, (c) one prepared meal and one potluck per week, 
and (d) small group discussions similar to those held during the 
retreat. 
PrimeTime participants were instructed to adhere to the 
Reversal Diet (13), which contains no animal products other than 
egg whites and nonfat yogurt and no added oils or other concen- 
trated fats. The high-fiber diet contains less than 10% of calories 
from fat, 70% to 75% of calories from carbohydrates, 15% to 20% 
of calories from protein, and 5 milligrams of cholesterol per day. 
After 15 months, the twice-weekly group meetings were reduced 
to 2-week intervals for 6 months, then reduced to once per month 
for the final 3 months. 
Measures 
A demographic/medical history questionnaire was adminis- 
tered in which participants identified the presence or absence of 15 
comorbidities. The behavioral measures have been previously 
described (23). Dietary measures consisted of the Kristal Food 
Habits Questionnaire (FHQ) (26), a 4-day food record (27), and a 
paper-and-pencil dietary fat intake screener (28). The FHQ, a 
20-item questionnaire, was employed to measure behaviors associ- 
ated with eating low-fat foods. Participants' 4-day food records 
were scored to determine average daily percent of calories 
consumed from fat and saturated fat, using the Minnesota Nutrition 
Data System (NDS) software (29). The fat screener (28) provided 
an estimate of daily grams of fat. 
Exercise measures consisted of the Stanford 7-Day Recall 
(30), which provided average kilocalories expended per day, and a 
composite score from our Summary of Self-Care Activities 
Questionnaire (31). 
Stress-management activities were assessed using the Sum- 
mary of Self-Care Activities Questionnaire (31). 
Current medications, including antihypertensive and hypolip- 
idemic medications, a reflection of physiological outcomes, were 
obtained by interview. 
Serum lipid profiles (mg/dl), blood pressure, and body mass 
index (BMI) were the physiological endpoints to document 
changes in CHD risk. The serum lipid profile was measured once at 
each endpoint to contain costs and lessen the demand on the 
participant's time. Fasting plasma total cholesterol (TC), high- 
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (Tg) 
were measured directly, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(LDL-C) was calculated using the formula: LDL-C = TC - 
(TG/5 + HDL-C). The Colin STBP-680 automated blood pressure 
unit was used to determine resting blood pressure, using the 
Heritage protocol (32). An average of six valid blood pressure 
readings was used for analyses. 
A measure of weight (kg) was taken in the morning in the 
fasting state, in stocking feet on a calibrated Cardinal Detecto 
Electronics digital readout scale. The scale, which has a capacity of 
400 pounds (by 2 graduation values), is accurate to plus or minus 1 
graduation. The scale was situated on a tile floor. Height, measured 
using a height bar attached to the scale and with participants 
standing without shoes and with head straight, was rounded to the 
nearest 0.5 cm. Measurements were converted to BMI (kg/m2). 
Frequency, duration, and severity of angina were reported using 
the Rose Chest Pain Questionnaire (33). Also calculated was a 
Framingham Heart Study (34) score for CHD women, which 
corresponds with an estimated percent risk of having another heart 
attack, stroke, or death from CI-ID in the next 2 years. This score 
calculates heart disease risk in terms of age, HDL cholesterol, 
systolic blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and presence or ab- 
sence of diabetes.

A general measure of functioning, the Medical Outcomes 
Study (MOS) Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) (35) was 
administered to assess quality of life. 
Statistical Analyses 
A series of one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were 
conducted to evaluate baseline equivalence of conditions and 
subject attrition. Given the small sample size and large number of 
measures, multivariate analyses of covariance (MANCOVA) were 
used to control experiment-wide error rate in evaluating program 
outcomes. MANCOVAs were conducted to evaluate intervention 
effects on three behavioral components (PrimeTime program 
adherence to dietary, physical activity, and stress management) and 
serum lipids (cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides). Where 
the overall MANCOVA was significant, follow-up analyses of 
covariance (ANCOVAs) were conducted to identify variables 
accounting for the differential change. In all analyses, baseline 
scores on the dependent variable, the Social Desirable Respond- 
ing Scale (36) (for psychosocial measures), and number of 
comorbid chronic diseases served as covariates. The MANCOVAs 
were repeated on data collected at the 4-, 12-, and 24-month 
assessments. 
RESULTS 
Twenty-eight participants who completed baseline assess- 
ments were randomized into the study. After the retreat, three 
PrimeTime participants were lost to follow-up. Of those, two 
experienced discomfort with the program and one died of an acute 
myocardial infarction prior to the 12-month follow-up. Twenty- 
five participants completed the 24-month follow-up. 
The baseline sample reported here is comprised of the 25 
participants who completed the 24-month follow-up. As can be 
seen in Table 1, no differences between conditions were found on 
any of the demographic and medical history variables with the 
exception of number of comorbid chronic diseases. Most patients 
had lived with their heart disease for a number of years, and 97% of 
the baseline sample also had other chronic diseases, most com- 
monly arthritis, hypertension (each affecting 68% of subjects), and 
diabetes (44%). The UC group had an average of 4.1 comorbid 
chronic illnesses and the PrimeTime group had an average of 2.6 
(F = 5.1, p < .02). The mean age was 63 with 32% of participants 
older than 70 years of age. Thirty-six percent of the participants 
were treated with cholesterol-lowering medication at baseline, and 
40% were receiving hormone replacement therapy. 
Program Adherence 
Attendance: Attendance at the twice-weekly 4-hour meetings 
for the duration of the 15-month treatment phase was good, with 
PrimeTime women attending an average 81% and support partners 
attending an average 70% of the sessions (SD = 13; range = 64 to 
104 of 118 total). During the maintenance phase, attendance for 
PrimeTime women at the 16 sessions ranged from 1 to 16 sessions 
(Mean = 10). 
Behavioral Outcomes: A series of three multivariate repeated 
measures analyses of covariance were conducted to evaluate the 
intervention effects on the following sets of measures: (a) dietary 
behavior, (b) physical activity, and (c) stress management. As 
shown in Table 2, the PrimeTime group showed significantly 
greater improvement on percent of dietary total and saturated fat 
than did the UC group, but not on total caloric intake. Data from 
4-day food records indicated that the intervention produced large,

significant, and consistent improvements in mean percent calories 
from fat (24-month follow-up scores of 12% for PrimeTime versus 
28% for UC) and mean percent calories from saturated fat 
(24-month follow-up scores of 3.1% for PrimeTime versus 8.7% 
for UC). Improvements were most substantial at the 4-month 
assessment. 
Physical activity results parallel those reported above for 
dietary self-care. There was a significant overall effect on the 
repeated measures MANCOVA for physical activity (F = 8.0; 
p = .01). PrimeTime participants substantially increased their 
number of exercise sessions and number of minutes spent engaged 
in physical activity each day compared to the UC group. 
Stress-management results indicated the PrimeTime group 
significantly increased the number of times per week they engaged 
in stress-management activities compared to the UC condition (see 
Table 2). These increases were detected by both the Structured 
Interview and the Summary of Self-Care Questionnaire. The 
PrimeTime participants showed a slight, nonsignificant decrease in 
practice of stress-management techniques at the 12- and 24-month 
follow-ups. 
The one smoker in the PrimeTime group successfully quit 
during the retreat and remained abstinent for the remainder of the 
program. This was confirmed by carbon monoxide and saliva 
continine analyses. The one smoker in the UC group has continued 
to smoke. 
Medication Changes 
Antihypertensive drugs were substantially reduced in the 
PrimeTime women from baseline to the 4-month follow-up (from 
97 mg per person per day on average to 21 mg per person per day), 
compared to a substantial increase among the UC condition (120 
mg at baseline to 240 mg at 4-month follow-up). The repeated 
measures ANCOVA on change in medication from baseline was 
significant (F = 3.56; p = .037). The PrimeTime women main- 
tained some of their improvement at the 12- and 24-month 
follow-ups (see Table 3). 
At baseline, the UC group was taking an average 175 mg of 
lipid medications, compared to an average 95 mg in the PrimeTime 
condition. At the 4-month follow-up, the PrimeTime women were 
taking an average of 52 mg less than they had at baseline, while the 
UC group had increased an average of 107 mg (p = .054). The 
repeated measures ANCOVA revealed that the PrimeTime women 
did not maintain these improvements at the 24-month follow-up 
(see Table 3).

Physiologic Outcomes 
Some favorable changes in risk factor status occurred for 
women in the PrimeTime condition. These results are summarized 
in Table 4. There was a small but significant decrease in BMI in 
PrimeTime women compared to UC (p = .041). The repeated 
measures ANCOVA revealed a 2-point drop in BMI from baseline 
to the 4- and 12-month follow-ups in the PrimeTime women, with 
no change for the UC group. The PrimeTime women gained 1 
point in BMI at 24-month follow-up. 
On the Rose questionnaire (33), PrimeTime women reported a 
reduction in frequency of chest pain episodes in the past 7 days 
from an average of 2.5 at baseline to 0.4 at the 24-month follow-up. 
The frequency of chest pain episodes rose over the 2-year period 
for the UC group from an average of 2.8 at baseline to 3.0 at 24 
months (repeated measures ANCOVA, F = 6.68; p = .01). Dura- 
tion and severity of angina symptoms were similarly improved for 
the PrimeTime women, but did not reach statistical significance 
(see Table 4). 
The PrimeTime women improved their heart disease risk 
score over the course of the 2 years. Their risk of further heart 
disease, stroke, or cardiovascular death decreased from 12.06 
(6.1% risk) at baseline to 10.86 (4.9% risk) (p = .04) at 24 
months, while that of the control group rose from 11.63 (6.1%) to 
11.9 (6.5%) during the same period. The repeated measures 
ANCOVA comparing conditions was marginally significant 
(p = .055). 
Differences between the PrimeTime and UC conditions in 
average changes in plasma lipid concentrations and blood pressure 
did not achieve statistical significance (see Table 4). 
While the PrimeTime group made impressive improvements 
in dietary fat intake, it is interesting to examine how closely they 
matched their counterparts in the Ornish Lifestyle Heart Trial. As

shown in Table 5, the group approached, but did not on average 
meet, the recommended Ornish guidelines or the levels reported of 
his study participants. 
Given the discrepancies between the Ornish guidelines and 
the PrimeTime women's program achievements, how did the 
PrimeTime women fare in terms of changes in CHD risk factors? 
Table 6 compares key risk factors between the two programs for 
baseline and 12-month follow-up. 
Quality of Life 
The repeated measures MANCOVA for all quality of life 
dimensions revealed overalI improvement in favor of the Prime- 
Time participants (F ~ 4.28; p = .026). Follow-up analyses re- 
vealed significantIy greater improvements in quality of life in the 
areas of general health (PrimeTime condition improved an average 
4 points, while the UC condition decreased 23 points) and social 
functioning (PrimeTime condition improved an average 22 points, 
while the UC condition decreased 4 points). The other four scales 
of the MOS SF-36 were nonsignificant. 
Impact of Attrition 
The results were reanalyzed to include women who dropped 
out of the study after the retreat. For each construct tested, baseline 
scores were substituted for the missing 4-, 12-, and 24-month 
follow-ups. The analyses made very little difference in the final 
outcomes. Of the 13 variables tested, differences on two outcomes 
were positively affected and one outcome was adversely affected. 
Significance levels improved for between-condition differences on 
the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol (from p = .080 to 
p = .033) and for Chest Pain Duration (from p = .06 to p = .05), 
and caused one variable, Chest Pain Frequency, to become 
nonsignificant. 
DISCUSSION 
The Lifestyle Heart Trial (25), the St. Thomas' Atherosclero- 
sis Regression Study (37), the Heidelberg Study (38), the Leiden 
Intervention Trial (39), and the Stanford Coronary Risk Interven- 
tion Project (21) have demoustrated that lifestyle can have a major 
influence on progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis. How- 
ever, participants in these trials were primarily male or included 
too few women to allow detection of gender effects. The Women's 
Lifestyle Heart Trial, despite a small sample size, demonstrated 
that a lifestyle intervention could produce marked, consistent 
behavioral differences sustained over 2 years in postmenopansal 
CHD females. Although this regimen placed heavy demands on 
participants, adherence and participation levels were good, and the 
intervention was moderately effective in producing improvements 
in BMI, angina symptoms, use of antihypertensive and lipid- 
lowering medications, coronary risk, and quality of life. 
It is worth noting that in the Orrtish Lifestyle Heart Trial, total 
cholesterol and LDL cholesterol improved significantly, while 
triglyceride and HDL cholesterol levels did not. Significant serum 
lipid improvements did not accrue in the Women's Lifestyle Heart 
Trial, but both studies achieved significant reductions in body 
weight (a l0 kg reduction in the Ornish program versus a 3.9 kg 
reduction in the PrimeTime program). Given their significant 
dietary improvements, especiaiIy compared to nationai averages 
(39), it remains unclear why the PrimeTime women did not show 
significant improvements in lipids. Gender differences, the small 
sample size, lack of precision in serum lipid measurements, or 
perhaps the reduction in their lipid-lowering medication may 
explain this. In the Lyon heart study (40), reduction in coronary 
events and reduction in cardiac deaths of close to 70% were 
achieved using the Mediterranean diet, without a reduction of total 
cholesterol or triglycerides, or an increase in HDL-C compared to 
controls. The Mediterranean diet, rich in carbohydrates and fiber, 
does not restrict dietary fat as severely as the Ornish diet, but does 
restrict saturated fat, which recently has been shown to reduce 
incidence of CHD (41). 
Although PrimeTime participants engaged in stress-manage- 
ment activities to a much greater degree than did the UC group, 
there is a large discrepancy in the frequency of their practices 
compared to their male counterparts in the Ornish Lifestyle Heart 
Trial. Regularly practicing stress-reduction techniques appeared to 
be challenging for the women. There were many difficulties cited 
by the PrimeTime participants, mostly stemming from structural 
problems with their bodies, other chronic diseases, and the feeling 
they lacked the time to relax. 
The PrimeTime women appeared to engage in physical 
activity on average about 44 minutes less at 24 months compared 
to 12 months. The reduction in physical activity by the PrimeTime 
women at the 24-mouth follow-up may reflect their greatly reduced 
contact with the program (from twice per week to once per month) 
by the end. It is possible that group support for exercise is 
extremely important. The PrimeTtme women also engaged in less 
physical activity than the men in the Omish study. This is not 
surprising since, compared to men, fewer women enroll in cardiac 
rehabilitation programs (42,43). In an assessment study of self- 
management of heart disease, the women were significantly less

likely than men to report close adherence to prescription for 
exercise (22). 
An important limitation of this study is the small sample of 
motivated women and generalizability of results to all CHD 
women over 50. It is possible that we have recruited a sample of 
highly motivated CHD women and that using a population-based 
approach to recruitment would have produced a different set of 
results. However, other investigators have used similar recruitment 
techniques in several major CHD clinical trials, including the 
Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (Mr. FIT) (44), a CHD diet 
and lifestyle trial conducted by Singh et ai. (10), and the large 
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (45). Other CHD 
behavioral investigations have experienced higher rates of nonpar- 
ticipation than in our study, including the Take Pride project (22) 
and Kane et al.'s (46) work with heterozygous familial hypercho- 
lesterolemia. Still, selection bias is a major threat to external 
validity. Investigators whenever possible should use recruitment 
strategies that provide samples reflecting general population 
characteristics. This was unfortunately not possible in the current 
investigation. A larger sample (at least 200, including adequate 
numbers of minority participants) would have permitted a better 
demonstration of the feasibility of implementing this program with 
larger, more diverse, and possibly less-motivated populations. 
The goals of this research and that of Omish et al. (24,25) 
differed. The major goal of the Lifestyle Heart Trial was to 
determine whether a comprehensive lifestyle program could by 
itself reverse heart disease, which it did in mostly male study 
participants. The main goal of the present project was to test 
whether the same procedures would produce substantial reductions 
in CHD risk factors in women. Given the small sample size, there

were a surprising number of significant physiologic and quality of 
life benefits accruing to the PrimeTime women. Overall lifestyle 
change appeared to have beneficial effects on general health, social 
functioning, and role functioning in women with CHD as mea- 
sured by the SF-36. Our past experience with the SF-36 indicated 
that this measure has been relatively resistant to change (47). The 
results showing improvement in quality of life for PrimeTime 
participants are particularly strong. The extent to which results 
obtained may apply to changes in coronary lesions is not known. 
Future research, with larger sample sizes and more sensitive 
measures, is needed to more thoroughly investigate lipid and blood 
pressure changes. The lipid measures were only collected once at 
each assessment point, which considerably inflates the error 
variance compared to the average of two or three measurements 
used in most lipid reduction studies (21,41). 
Intensive, concurrent management of multiple lifestyle behav- 
iors may not seem feasible given the resources of many health care 
systems. The women who participated in this trial were at 
extremely high risk for further CHD-related diseases, which are 
major causes of health care expenditures as well as mortality. For 
them, a program with this level of intensity may be warranted. 
Still, the overall cost of the intervention is considerably less than 
invasive surgical or even some intensive pharmacologic or cardiac 
rehabilitation interventions (7). Future research should address 
ways to reduce and more thoroughly evaluate costs of this 
intervention approach. It is possible that less frequent meetings and 
lay/peer led groups would be as effective (48,49). It may be that 
some of the intervention components are less essential than others. 
Our clinical impression is that the social support component is as 
critical for women with CHD as it appears to be in managing other 
diseases (50,51). More research is also needed to understand how 
comprehensive lifestyle change affects quality of life, which may 
be the ultimate outcome (52,53). Results of the current study are 
encouraging.
