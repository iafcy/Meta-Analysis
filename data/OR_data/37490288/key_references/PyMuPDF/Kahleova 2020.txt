Abstract
IMPORTANCE Excess body weight and insulin resistance lead to type 2 diabetes and other major
health problems. There is an urgent need for dietary interventions to address these conditions.
OBJECTIVE To measure the effects of a low-fat vegan diet on body weight, insulin resistance,
postprandial metabolism, and intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipid levels in overweight adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 16-week randomized clinical trial was conducted
between January 2017 and February 2019 in Washington, DC. Of 3115 people who responded to
flyers in medical offices and newspaper and radio advertisements, 244 met the participation criteria
(age 25 to 75 years; body mass index of 28 to 40) after having been screened by telephone.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group (n = 122) was
asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet and the control group (n = 122) to make no diet changes for
16 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES At weeks 0 and 16, body weight was assessed using a
calibrated scale. Body composition and visceral fat were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry.
Insulin resistance was assessed with the homeostasis model assessment index and the predicted
insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM). Thermic effect of food was measured by indirect calorimetry over
3 hours after a standard liquid breakfast (720 kcal). In a subset of participants (n = 44),
hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids were quantified by proton magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS Among the 244 participants in the study, 211 (87%) were female, 117 (48%) were White,
and the mean (SD) age was 54.4 (11.6) years. Over the 16 weeks, body weight decreased in the
intervention group by 5.9 kg (95% CI, 5.0-6.7 kg; P < .001). Thermic effect of food increased in the
intervention group from baseline to 16 weeks and did not change significantly in the control group
(between-group difference in effect size, 14.1%; 95% CI, 6.5-20.4; P < .001). The homeostasis model
assessment index decreased (−1.3; 95% CI, −2.2 to −0.3; P < .001) and PREDIM increased (0.9; 95%
CI, 0.5-1.2; P < .001) in the intervention group. Hepatocellular lipid levels decreased in the
intervention group by 34.4%, from a mean (SD) of 3.2% (2.9%) to 2.4% (2.2%) (P = .002), and
intramyocellular lipid levels decreased by 10.4%, from a mean (SD) of 1.6 (1.1) to 1.5 (1.0) (P = .03).
None of these variables changed significantly in the control group over the 16 weeks. The change in
PREDIM correlated negatively with the change in body weight (r = −0.43; P < .001). Changes in

Introduction
Overweight and associated diseases, particularly type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, remain
worldwide challenges. There is an urgent need for dietary interventions to address these problems
and for a better understanding of how different dietary interventions work.
Obesity is uncommon in individuals whose diets are based on plant-derived foods.1,2 In clinical
trials, such diets caused weight loss, for which 2 explanations have been offered.3 First, a high-fiber,
low-fat diet has a low energy density, which reduces energy intake. Second, a low-fat, vegan diet
increases the thermic effect of food, which accounts for approximately 10% of total energy
expenditure.4 However, in the latter randomized clinical trial, the control group was following an
active diet based on National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines.5 Because there was no
untreated control group, the effect of a low-fat vegan diet on thermogenesis remains unclear.
Studies have reported that people following a vegan diet have lower concentrations of
intramyocellular lipids compared with those following omnivorous diets, suggesting that by reducing
intramyocellular or hepatocellular lipid levels, a plant-based diet may lead to increased mitochondrial
activity and postprandial metabolism.6,7 This is particularly important because the accumulation of
lipids in muscle and liver cells may also be associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.8-10
The aim of this study was to measure the effects of a low-fat vegan diet on body weight, insulin
resistance, postprandial metabolism, and intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipid levels in
overweight adults.
Methods
Study Design and Eligibility
This randomized clinical trial using a single-center, open parallel design was conducted between
January 2017 and February 2019 in Washington, DC, in 4 replications (the trial protocol is given in
Supplement 1). Adults aged 25 to 75 years with a body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 28 to 40 were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were
diabetes, smoking, alcohol or drug use, pregnancy or lactation, and current use of a vegan diet. The
additional exclusion criteria for the subset of participants undergoing the proton magnetic resonance
spectroscopy were the presence of any metal implant, claustrophobia, BMI higher than 38, and waist
circumference of more than 102 cm. The study protocol was approved by the Chesapeake
Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written informed consent. This study followed the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.11

Randomization and Study Groups
With use of a computer-generated system, participants were randomly assigned (in a 1:1 ratio) to an
intervention group, which was asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet, or a control group, which was
asked to make no diet changes. The randomization protocol could not be accessed by the
participants or the staff allocating the participants into groups beforehand. Because assignment was
done simultaneously, allocation concealment was unnecessary. The participants were not blinded
to their group assignment.
The intervention diet (approximately 75% of energy from carbohydrates, 15% protein, and 10%
fat) consisted of vegetables, grains, legumes, and fruits without animal products or added fats.
Vitamin B12 was supplemented (500 μg/d). The intervention group attended weekly classes for
detailed instruction and cooking demonstrations and received printed materials and small food
samples. No meals were provided.
For both groups, alcoholic beverages were limited to 1 per day for women and 2 per day for men.
All participants were asked to maintain their customary exercise habits and medications unless
modified by their personal physicians.
Outcomes
All measurements were performed at baseline and 16 weeks. The outcome assessors (K.F.P., G.I.S.,
and A.T.) were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcomes were body weight, insulin
resistance, postprandial metabolism, and the concentrations of intramyocellular and
hepatocellular lipids.
At baseline and at 16 weeks, dietary intake data over 3 consecutive days were collected and
analyzed by staff members certified in the Nutrition Data System for Research, version 2016,
developed by the Nutrition Coordinating Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.12 In addition,
study dietitians made unannounced telephone calls to assess participants’ dietary adherence. All
study participants were asked not to alter their exercise habits and to continue their preexisting
medication regimens for the duration of the study. Physical activity was assessed by the International
Physical Activity Questionnaire.13
Laboratory assessments were made after an overnight fast. Height (baseline only) and weight
were measured using a stadiometer and a calibrated digital scale, respectively. Body composition and
visceral fat volume were assessed using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA; GE Healthcare),
which has been validated against computed tomography14 and magnetic resonance imaging.15 The
measurement of total body fat and visceral fat had a coefficient of variation (CV) of 1.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.16,17
Insulin secretion was assessed after a standardized liquid breakfast (Boost Plus, Nestle) (720
kcal, 34% of energy from fat, 16% protein, and 50% carbohydrate). Plasma glucose, immunoreactive
insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were measured at 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes. Plasma
glucose concentration was analyzed using the Hexokinase UV end point method (the intra-assay CV
was 1.4%, and the inter-assay CV was 1.9%), and immunoreactive insulin and C-peptide
concentrations were determined using insulin and C-peptide electro-chemiluminescence
immunoassay (the intra-assay CVs were 5.1% and 3.8%, respectively, and the inter-assay CVs were
5.7% and 3.9%, respectively). Glycated hemoglobin level was measured by turbidimetric inhibition
immunoassay (the intra-assay CV was 3.7%, and the inter-assay CV was 3.5%), and lipid
concentrations were measured by enzymatic colorimetric methods (intra-assay CV: total cholesterol,
2.1%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2.4%; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 2.0%; and
triglycerides 2.2%; inter-assay CV: total cholesterol, 2.7%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 3.8%;
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 3.0%; and triglycerides 3.2%). All test kits were made by Roche.
Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment index.18 The
predicted insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM) provided a validated measure of dynamic insulin
sensitivity.19 Resting energy expenditure and postprandial metabolism were measured by indirect
calorimetry (Cosmed Quark CPET) using a ventilated hood system (accuracy of measurement with a

CV<1% and repeatability of measurement with a CV of 1.2%).20,21 Each measurement was performed
for 15 minutes after an overnight fast and 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the standard breakfast.
In a subset of 44 participants (23 in the intervention group and 21 in the control group), proton
magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed at the Magnetic Resonance Research Center, Yale
School of Medicine. Hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids were quantified by proton magnetic
resonance spectroscopy at 4T (Bruker).22 This method has been shown to provide a precise
quantification of fat fractions, with a mean bias of −1.1.% to 0.5%.23 Hepatocellular lipid content was
measured by 1H respiratory-gated stimulated echo acquisition mode spectroscopy in a
15 × 15 × 15-mm3 voxel. Acquisition was synchronized to the respiratory cycle and triggered at the
end of expiration. A water-suppressed lipid spectrum and a lipid-suppressed water spectrum were
acquired in 3 locations of the liver to account for liver inhomogeneity, and the total lipid content was
averaged and calculated. In addition, hepatocellular lipid content was corrected for transverse
relaxation using the transverse relaxation times of 22 ms for water and 44 ms for lipid.24
Intramyocellular lipid content was measured in the soleus muscle using an 8.5-cm diameter circular
13C surface coil with twin, orthogonal circular 13-cm 1H quadrature coils. Scout images of the lower leg
were obtained to ensure correct positioning of the participant and to define an adequate volume for
localized shimming using the FastMap procedure.25
Power Analysis
Sample size was based on the change in body weight, insulin resistance, and postprandial
metabolism previously observed with a plant-based diet,4 with an α level of 0.05. The assumed
change for body weight was a mean (SD) of 5.8 (3.2) kg in the intervention arm and 1 (3.2) kg in the
control arm; for insulin sensitivity, the assumed change was 1.1 (2.1) in the intervention arm and 0.1
(2.1) in the control arm; and for the thermic effect of food, the assumed change was 4.7 (12) (area
under the curve) in the intervention arm and 0.3 (9.4) in the control arm. For the primary efficacy
comparison, a total of 22 participants (11 per arm) were required for 90% power to detect a
significant treatment effect on body weight between the 2 study arms. For insulin sensitivity, a total
of 142 participants (71 in each arm) were required for 90% power. Assuming that the treatment
effect for postprandial metabolism was of the same magnitude at each of the 5 evaluation points
used in metabolic assessment and that the SD was approximately 10.85 points for all observations,
with 5 observations per participant correlated at a magnitude of 0.7 with each other, and assuming
an attrition of 10%, the required sample size was 81 per group (162 total) for 80% power and 108 per
group (216 total) for 90% power.
For the substudy assessing the role of intramyocellular and hepatocellular lipids in insulin
sensitivity, a study26 from 2012 provided a basis for a power analysis. In that study, 7 lean individuals
with insulin resistance followed a hypocaloric (1200 kcal/d) diet for 9 weeks. The mean (SD)
intramyocellular lipid level decreased from 1.1% (0.2%) to 0.8% (0.1%). Assuming a mean (SD)
change in the intramyocellular lipid level of 0.3% (0.2%) in the intervention arm and a mean change
of 0 with a similar SD in the control arm, to have 90% power to detect a difference of this magnitude
between, the 2 arms would each require 11 individuals (22 total). Because this was an exploratory
substudy and variability in response to the diet was largely unknown, 20 participants were recruited
per arm (a total of 40 participants).
Statistical Analysis
For baseline characteristics, between-group t tests were performed for continuous variables and χ2
or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. A repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) model
was used with between-person and within-person factors and interactions, including group, person,
and time. The interaction between group and time was calculated for each variable. For thermic
effect of food, minutes were included in the ANOVA model. Data from only individuals with
measurements at both time points were included in the ANOVA model. Within each group, paired

comparison t tests were calculated to test whether the changes from baseline to 16 weeks were
statistically significant.
To eliminate skewed data distribution and heteroscedasticity, data were transformed to a
gaussian distribution before further processing by a power transformation using the statistical
software Statgraphics Centurion, version XV (Statpoint Inc). The transformed data underwent
multivariable regression using the method of orthogonal projections to latent structure.27 This
method is effective in addressing severe multicollinearity within the matrix of independent variables.
In our model, changes in thermic effect of food and in hepatocellular lipid levels were chosen as the
dependent variables and the metabolic variables (body weight, fat mass, visceral fat, and insulin
resistance) represented the independent variables. The variability was separated into 2 independent
components. The predictive component contained the variability in the metabolic variables, which
was shared with changes in dependent variables, and the orthogonal component contained the
variability shared within the metabolic variables. A detailed description of the orthogonal projections
to latent structure model is available elsewhere.28 The statistical software SIMCA-P, version 11.5
(Umetrics AB) identified the number of relevant components using the prediction error sum of
squares and also allowed the detection of multivariable nonhomogeneities and testing for
multivariable normal distribution and homoscedasticity (constant variance). The statisticians (M.H,
R.H.) were blinded to the interventions and group assignment. Results are presented as means with
95% CIs. Two-tailed tests were used to determine significance at the 5% level.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Of 3115 people screened by telephone, 244 met the participation criteria, signed the consent form
and were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 122) or control (n = 122) groups in a 1:1 ratio
(Figure 1). The mean (SD) age of the intervention group was 53 (10) years compared with 57 (13)
years in the control group (P = .01) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). There were no other significant
differences between the groups. Five intervention group and 16 control group participants dropped
out, mostly for reasons unrelated to the study, leaving 223 (91.0%) individuals who completed the
study. eTable 2 in Supplement 2 shows the baseline characteristics of those who completed the study
and those who dropped out. There were no significant differences between these groups. The main
outcomes are reported in Table 1. The treatment effects were largely unaffected by the adjustment
for age and race/ethnicity (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). eTable 3 in Supplement 2 shows the
characteristics of the subgroup that underwent magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This group had a
lower BMI compared with the rest of the study population. The model adjusted for baseline BMI for
magnetic resonance spectroscopy is presented in eFigure 2 in Supplement 2.
Dietary Intake and Physical Activity
Self-reported energy intake decreased in both groups but more so in the intervention group
(treatment effect, −354.9 kcal/d; 95% CI, −519.0 to −190.8 kcal/d; P < .001) (Table 2). In the
intervention group, mean intakes of carbohydrate and fiber increased, whereas mean fat, protein,
and cholesterol intake decreased. These values did not change significantly in the control group.
Physical activity decreased slightly in both groups (−709.8 metabolic equivalents [95% CI, −1346 to
−73.9 metabolic equivalents] in the control group and −604.8 metabolic equivalents [95% CI, −1388
to −178.6 metabolic equivalents] in the intervention group; between-group P = .84).
Body Weight, Body Composition, and Blood Lipid Levels
Mean body weight decreased by 6.4 kg in the intervention group compared with 0.5 kg in the control
group (treatment effect, −5.9 kg; 95% CI, −6.7 to −5.0; interaction between group and time,
P < .001). This difference was largely attributable to a reduction in body fat, as noted by significant
decreases in fat mass and visceral fat volume in the intervention group participants. Total and

low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 0.5 mmol/L and 0.4 mmol/L (to convert to
milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.0259), respectively, in the intervention group, with no significant
changes in the control group (0.1 mmol/L and 0.07 mmol/L, respectively) (P < .001 for both).
Insulin Sensitivity
Fasting plasma insulin concentration decreased by 21.6 pmol/L (to convert to micro-IU per milliliter,
divide by 6.945) in the intervention group, with no significant change in the control group (23.6
pmol/L; 95% CI, −5.0 to 54.3; between-group P = .006). The homeostasis model assessment index
(a measure of insulin resistance) decreased significantly (−1.3; 95% CI, −2.2 to −0.3; P < .001), and
PREDIM (a measure of insulin sensitivity) increased significantly in the intervention group (0.9; 95%
CI, 0.5-1.2; P < .001); neither changed significantly in the control group (Table 2). Within the
intervention group, the change in PREDIM correlated negatively with the change in body weight
(r = −0.43; P < .001).

Postprandial Metabolism
Postprandial energy expenditure (the thermic effect of food) increased in the intervention group
from baseline to 16 weeks and did not change significantly in the control group (between-group
difference effect size, 14.1%; 95% CI, 6.5%-20.4%; interaction between group and time, P < .001)
(Figure 2A). The F values were as follows: group, F = 1.7 (P = .19); week, F = 15.4 (P < .001); time,
F = 122.4 (P < .001); group × week, F = 11.9 (P < .001); group × time, F = 1.1 (P = .35); week × time,
F = 1.38 (P = .25). The results were similar in models adjusted for age and race/ethnicity (eFigure 1 in
Supplement 2). Within the intervention group, the change in thermic effect of food did not correlate
significantly with changes in body weight (r = −0.15; P = .09), PREDIM (r = 0.06; P = .54), energy
intake (r = 0.01; P = .90), or fiber consumption (r = 0.07; P = .48). In both groups combined, changes
in thermic effect of food correlated negatively with changes in fat mass (r = −0.30; P < .05) and
positively with changes in PREDIM (r = 0.36; P < .05). That is, as fat mass decreased and insulin
sensitivity improved, postprandial metabolism increased (Table 2).
A linear regression model for changes in reported energy intake and body weight showed that
every 100 kcal/d change in energy intake was associated with a 0.15 kg change in body weight
(eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). The mean (SD) reported energy reduction of 355 (617) kcal in the
intervention group compared with the control group would therefore be associated with a mean (SD)
weight loss of 0.53 (4.4) kg. For changes in postprandial energy expenditure and body weight, every
change in postprandial energy expenditure of 10 000 U in area under the curve was associated with
a change in body weight of 0.48 kg (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2). The mean (SD) decrease in
postprandial energy expenditure of 8588 (34 020) U of area under the curve was associated with an
mean (SD) weight loss of 0.41 (2.8) kg.
Hepatocellular and Intramyocellular Lipid Levels
In the 44 participants for whom hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels were quantified,
baseline hepatocellular lipid content was generally in the normal range.29,30 Nonetheless,
hepatocellular lipid content decreased in the intervention group by 34.4% (from a mean [SD] of 3.2%
[2.9%] to 2.4% [2.2%]; P = .03) and remained unchanged in the control group (from a mean [SD] of
3.3% [4.3%] to 3.6% [4.7%]) (group, F = 3.1 [P = .09]; week, F = 1.27 [P = .27]; group × week,
F = 10.8 [P = .002]) (Figure 2B). Results were similar in models adjusted for age and race/ethnicity
(eFigure 1 in Supplement 2) and for baseline BMI (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Within the intervention group, the decrease in hepatocellular lipid levels was significantly
associated with change in body weight (r = 0.42; P = .04) but not with changes in reported energy
intake (r = 0.24; P = .27) or fiber consumption (r = 0.07; P = .76). In both groups combined, changes
in hepatocellular lipid levels correlated negatively with changes in PREDIM (r = −0.47; P < .05). That
is, as hepatocellular lipid level decreased, insulin sensitivity increased. Changes in hepatocellular lipid

levels correlated positively with changes in body weight (r = 0.91; P < .01), BMI (r = 0.90; P < .01), fat
mass (r = 0.91; P < .01), and visceral fat (r = 0.80; P < .01) (Table 3).
Changes in intramyocellular lipid levels were not statistically significant in within-group
comparisons, but owing to the opposite trends, the treatment effect was significantly decreased in
the intervention group by 10.4%, from a mean (SD) of 1.6 (1.1) to 1.5 (1.0) (P = .03) (group, F = 4.7
[P = .04]; week, F = 0.02 [P = .88]; group × week, F = 5.1 [P = .03]) (Figure 1C). Within the
intervention group (n = 23), changes in both hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels
correlated with changes in insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis model assessment
index (both r = 0.51; P = .01). In both groups combined, changes in intramyocellular lipid levels
correlated positively with changes in fat mass (r = 0.51; P < .05) and homeostasis model assessment
index score (r = 0.52; P < .05). That is, as fat mass decreased, intramyocellular lipid levels and insulin
resistance decreased.
Discussion
In this trial, the dietary intervention reduced body weight, apparently owing to its tendency to
reduce energy intake and increase postprandial energy expenditure. The intervention also improved
glycemic control and reduced insulin concentrations, owing in part to reduced lipid accumulation in
liver and muscle cells and thus reduced insulin resistance in these organs.

The intervention diet’s effect on weight and insulin action are clinically important.
Hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids play central roles in hepatic and muscle insulin resistance,
respectively, and in type 2 diabetes. A 16-week diet of 1200 kcal per day resulted in a moderate
weight loss of approximately 8 kg, which was sufficient to normalize liver lipid content and fasting
plasma glucose concentrations as well as reverse hepatic insulin resistance in patients with obesity
and type 2 diabetess.31 A potential mechanism explaining the improvement in insulin sensitivity is the
reduction in intracellular diacylglycerol levels, which reduce insulin signaling in liver and muscle,
leading to tissue-specific insulin resistance.22,32,33
The effects of the dietary intervention on hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels and
insulin sensitivity—the presumed basis for the improved glycemic control—has not previously been
quantified in clinical trials. Energy restriction has been shown to reduce intramyocellular and
hepatocellular lipid levels and improve glycemic control in healthy young individuals without
diabetes.26,34,35 In young, lean individuals with insulin resistance, a hypocaloric diet (approximately
1200 kcal) led to a mean weight loss of 4.1 kg and a 30% reduction of intramyocellular lipids during a
9-week intervention.26 In contrast, the intervention diet in the present study did not restrict energy
intake but nonetheless led to 34% and 10% reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid
levels, respectively. The reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels correlated with
the reduction in fat mass, consistent with prior studies.26,36,37
The present finding that the increase in thermic effect of food was associated with decreased
fat mass and increased insulin sensitivity confirm the findings of previous research.38,39 The
increased insulin sensitivity may have contributed to the increased postprandial metabolism. In
addition, increased postprandial metabolism may have promoted further reduction in fat mass and
an increase in insulin sensitivity.
Despite the ad libitum diet, the participants in the intervention group reduced their energy
intake, consistent with many previous trials using vegan diets. This not only contributes to weight
loss but also may have contributed to the decrease in hepatocellular triglyceride content.31
Postprandial metabolism is influenced by meal composition.40-43 In the present study, however,
the test meal was identical for all study phases. These results suggest that the increased postprandial
thermogenesis was attributable to improved insulin sensitivity.

Strengths and Limitations
This study has several strengths. The randomized parallel design in which all participants within each
cohort began the study simultaneously controlled for seasonal diet fluctuations. The study duration
provided sufficient time for adaptation to the diet. Physiologic stimulation by a standard mixed meal
permitted quantification of insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion during a physiologic perturbation.
Measurement of visceral, hepatocellular, and intramyocellular lipid levels, in addition to the detailed
assessment of the thermic effect of food, are also strengths. The low attrition suggests that the
intervention was acceptable.
The study also has limitations. Self-reports of dietary intake have well-known limitations.44
However, it is reassuring that the reported diet changes were paralleled by changes in weight and
plasma lipid levels. Health-conscious participants may not be representative of the general
population but may be representative of a clinical population seeking help for weight problems or
type 2 diabetes. We followed the participants for 16 weeks and were not able to estimate the effects
of the diet over a longer period. In addition, the study design did not allow separation of the specific
effects of the low-fat vegan diet from the weight loss it causes.
Conclusions
This randomized clinical trial found that a low-fat plant-based dietary intervention reduces body
weight by reducing energy intake and increasing postprandial metabolism, apparently owing to
increased insulin sensitivity resulting from reduced hepatocellular and intramyocellular fat. This
intervention may be an effective treatment for overweight adults.
