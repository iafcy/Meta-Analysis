in Men: Effects on Body Composition and
Indices of Metabolic Syndrome
Minghua Tang1, Cheryl L.H. Armstrong1, Heather J. Leidy2 and Wayne W. Campbell1
Objective: This study assessed the effectiveness of a prescribed weight-loss diet with 0.8 versus 1.4 g
proteinkg1 day1 on changes in weight, body composition, indices of metabolic syndrome, and resting
energy expenditure (REE) in overweight and obese men.
Design and Methods: Men were randomized to groups that consumed diets containing 750 kcal day1 less
than daily energy needs for weight maintenance with either normal protein (NP, n ¼ 21) or higher protein (HP,
n ¼ 22) content for 12 weeks. The macronutrient distributions of the NP and HP diets were 25:60:15, and
25:50:25 percent energy from fat, carbohydrate, and protein, respectively. Assessments were made pre and
post intervention. The subjects were retrospectively subgrouped into overweight and obese groups.
Results and Conclusion: Both diet groups lost comparable body weight and fat. The HP group lost less
lean body mass than the NP group (1.9 6 0.3 vs. 3.0 6 0.4 kg). The effects of protein and BMI status
on lean body mass loss were additive. The reductions in total cholesterol, HDL-C, triacylglycerol,
glucose, and insulin, along with LDL-C, total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio, and HOMA-IR, were not
statistically different between NP and HP. Likewise, macronutrient distributions of the diet did not affect the
reductions in REE, and blood pressure. In conclusion, energy restriction effectively improves multiple
clinical indicators of cardiovascular health and glucose control, and consumption of a higher-protein diet
and accomplishing weight loss when overweight versus obese help men preserve lean body mass over a
short period of time.

Introduction
The prevalence of overweight (BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg m2)
and obesity (BMI  30 kg m2) among US adults has increased
dramatically over the past few decades with currently 34 and 68%
of the population, respectively, either obese or overweight/obese (1).
Overweight and obesity are associated with high prevalence of
metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors including hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, and central obesity (2). Dietary
energy restriction is an effective means to lose weight (3). Among
myriad energy-restricted diets, higher-protein diets (>25% of energy
from protein) are recommended and promoted because they may
suppress appetite (4-6) and help preserve lean body mass (7-9),
which may lead to a corresponding retention of resting energy
expenditure (REE) (10). REE retention is essential for weight main-
tenance after weight loss (11). An effective weight-loss diet should
focus on weight reduction and successfully reducing indices of met-
abolic syndrome. There are still debates on the optimal weight-loss
diet to treat overweight and obesity-related complications. Higher-
protein diets with protein replacing carbohydrate are reported in
some studies to reduce insulin resistance (8) and blood pressure
(12), but not others (13,14). Higher-protein diets with protein from
animal sources are often high in saturated fat which may have a
tendency to increase low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). In
addition, consuming a higher-protein diet may compromise renal
function and worsen insulin resistance in individuals predisposed to
kidney diseases (15). In the current study, we hypothesized that
compared with a normal-protein diet, overweight and obese men
consuming a higher-protein, energy-restricted diet would success-
fully lose weight and improve metabolic health while retaining lean
body mass and without impairing renal function over 12 weeks of
controlled feeding.
Overweight and obese adults are often included in weight loss stud-
ies without regard to their clinical weight status, presumably based
on the assumption that their responses would not differ. However,
evidence suggests that obese individuals are at higher risk of
metabolic syndrome (16) and it is possible that BMI classification

(overweight vs. obese) may influence the changes in body composi-
tion and metabolic health parameters after weight loss. In a previous
study, we observed that when overweight and obese women
consumed normal or higher protein diets, comparable to those con-
sumed by the men in the current study, for 12 weeks, the group of
women who were overweight at the start of the intervention lost less
lean body mass than the women who were obese (17). In regards to
body composition changes, the main effects of normal vs. higher
protein intake and overweight vs. obese classification were inde-
pendent and additive. The current study extends these findings with
comparable analyses in men.
The primary purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of
a prescribed weight-loss diet with 0.8 versus 1.4 g kg1 day1 of
protein on energy-restriction-induced changes in body weight, body
composition, metabolic syndrome-related indices, REE, and kidney
function in overweight and obese men. The secondary purpose was
to assess if BMI classification (overweight vs. obese) would affect
the outcomes listed above.
Methods and Procedures
Subjects
Potential subjects were recruited via local newspaper advertisement
and campus mail. The Purdue University Biomedical Institutional
Review Board approved the study protocol and each subject signed
an informed-consent form before enrollment (clinicaltrial.gov registra-
tion ID: NCT00812162). Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) male
21 years and older; (2) BMI between 25.0 and 39.9 kg m2; (3)
weight stable (<4.5 kg weight change within last 6 months); (4)
nonsmoking; (5) constant habitual activity patterns within last 3
months; (6) clinically normal blood profiles (specifically, normal liver
and kidney functions; fasting blood glucose <110 mg dL1). Each
subject received a monetary stipend for participating in the study.
Fifty-five men met the entry requirements and started the intervention.
Forty-five subjects completed the study and two were excluded from
the final analyses due to noncompliance with testing procedures and
dietary control. Thus, data from 43 subjects were analyzed and
reported [42 Caucasian (98%), 1 African American (2%)].
Study design
This 13-week protocol included 1 week of baseline and 12 weeks of
controlled-feeding intervention with energy restriction. Testing at
baseline and intervention week 12 included two fasting blood sam-
ples on separate days, one body composition measurement, and die-
tary intakes assessment on 3 nonconsecutive days. Subjects con-
sumed their usual, unrestricted diets ad libitum during baseline and
were randomly assigned to consume either a normal-protein (NP;
15% of total energy from protein; n ¼ 21), or higher-protein (HP;
25% of total energy from protein; n ¼ 22) energy-restricted diet for
12 weeks. Fat content was kept constant at 25% for both diets, while
carbohydrate content was 60% for the NP diet and 50% for the HP
diet. The authors recognize that the changes in outcomes might be
attributable to increased protein or decreased carbohydrate. For
descriptive purposes, the dietary interventions are described with
respect to protein (NP vs. HP) because the relative difference
between groups for protein intake is greater than for carbohydrate
(60% vs. 21%, respectively). Subjects were also retrospectively
subgrouped according to their BMI status [overweight, BMI ¼ 25.0-
29.9 kg m2; obese, BMI ¼ 30-39.9 kg m2], which resulted in 17
overweight and 27 obese subjects.
Dietary intervention
The energy content of each subject’s diet was 750 kcal day1 less
than their energy requirement, which was estimated using the
Harris-Benedict equation (18) with an activity factor of 1.5. The NP
diet contained the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of 0.8 g
proteinkg1 day1 while the HP diet contained 1.4 g protein kg1
day1, which equaled 15 and 25% of total energy from protein,
respectively,
at
the
start of
the
intervention
period. Subjects
consumed one multivitamin/mineral supplement (Centrum; Wyeth
Consumer Healthcare, Madison, NJ) and two calcium citrate tablets
(400 mg calcium/tablet; total 800 mg calcium/day) daily.
Subjects were counseled to follow 7-day menus with specified quanti-
ties of typical and brand-specific food items to purchase and
consume. Before starting the diet, each subject met with the study di-
etitian and was instructed on effective ways to follow and adhere to
the diet plan. The NP group menus were void of animal flesh foods
(i.e., striated tissues) and egg products; they were given portioned
quantities of milk comprising 13% of their total protein intake, while
the HP group was provided with portioned quantities of cooked lean
pork (loin, ham, or Canadian bacon) and egg products comprising
40% of their total protein intake (25% from pork and 15% from
eggs). Thus, the NP diet was lacto-vegetarian and the HP diet was
omnivorous. This study was not designed to compare sources of pro-
tein (dairy vs. meat/egg). Milk was given to the NP group to equalize
the interactions and contact time with the study coordinator that the
HP group received. To document adherence to the diet, subjects were
asked to complete daily food check-offs and return them to the
research laboratory on weekly basis. The food check-off contained a
list of each food item and its quantity the subject needed to consume
on that day. Subjects were asked to check the consumed food items
and to note any foods or beverages not consumed. Extra foods or bev-
erages consumed (highly discouraged) were also recorded on the food
logs by the subjects. Subjects’ actual dietary intakes were analyzed
using the food check-offs with adjustments made for any documented
deviations from the prescribed menus accounted for. Energy and mac-
ronutrient composition were calculated using ProNutra (Release 3.2,
Viocare Technologies, Princeton, NJ).
Clinical measurements
Body weight and composition. During the intervention, each sub-
ject’s body weight was recorded twice weekly using an electronic
platform scale (ES200L; Mettler, Toledo, OH). Fasting state fat mass
(including android and gynoid fat mass) and lean body mass were
measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; GE Medical
Systems/LUNAR ProdigyTM) at baseline and postintervention.
Blood pressure. On two separate days at both baseline and postin-
tervention, reclining and sitting systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were measured in duplicate using a sphygmomanometer. Subjects
rested for 15 min before blood pressures were taken.
Resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Indirect
calorimetry (MedGraphics Cardiopulmonary Diagnostics Systems,
MedGraphics Corporation, St. Paul, MN) was used to measure CO2
production and O2 consumption, which were used to estimate REE

in a fasting state. Three-hour urine collections were made on the
REE testing days while the subject was in a fasting state and urinary
urea nitrogen excretion was measured. Substrate oxidation was esti-
mated using the following equations (19):
Protein oxidation (g min1) = 6.25  urinary urea nitrogen excre-
tion (N, g min1)
Carbohydrate oxidation (g min1) = 4.55VCO2 (L min1) 
3.21VO2 (L min1) – 2.87N
Fat oxidation (g min1) = 1.67VO2 (L min1)  1.67VCO2 (L
min1) – 1.92N
Blood collections
Fasting state blood samples were collected on 2 days at baseline and
post-intervention, into serum-separator tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at
4,000g and 4C to obtain serum, and stored at 80C until analysis.
Biochemical analyses and calculations
Cardiovascular, metabolic status. Total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol
(HDL-C),
triacylglycerol,
glucose,
and
creatinine were measured by photometric assays (Chemistry Immuno
Analyzer AU5700; Olympus, Center Valley, PA) at MidAmerica
Clinical Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). Serum insulin concentration
was
measured
by
an
electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay
method on an Elecsys 2010 analyzer (Roche Diagnostic Systems)
and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated using: glucose
(mg dL1)  insulin (lU mL1)/405 (20). LDL-C was estimated
using the following equation:
LDL-C ¼ total cholesterol – HDL-C – (triacylglycerol/5) (21). The
total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio was also calculated.
Kidney disease risk factor. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was
estimated to assess kidney function using the following formula (22):
GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 186  [serum creatinine (mg/dL)]1.154 
[age (years)]0.203  (0.742 if female)  (1.210 if African American)
Total protein intake. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured
using a photometric assay (Chemistry Immuno Analyzer AU5700;
Olympus) performed by MidAmerica Clinical Laboratories. BUN
was used to crudely evaluate differences in protein consumption
between groups and subjects’ dietary compliance (23).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.2.1; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Group data are presented as mean 6 SE. Base-
line parameters were compared using independent Student’s t test
between the NP and HP groups. Repeated measures ANOVA were
used to evaluate the main effects of time, protein intake, and BMI sta-
tus and their interactions on the dependent variables. Baseline values
between groups were included in the model as covariates. Post hoc
analyses used Student’s t test to compare the changes overtime
between groups. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Subject characteristics
There were no statistically significant differences between NP and
HP groups in age, height, weight, BMI, or body composition at
baseline (Table 1).
Dietary intake and compliance. As designed, the prescribed NP
diet contained less protein and more carbohydrate (P < 0.001) com-
pared with the HP diet and fat contents were comparable in both
diets (Table 2). Table 2 also shows the total energy and macronu-
trients the groups of subjects actually consumed at intervention
weeks 1 and 12. Subjects’ macronutrient intakes did not change

from week 1 to 12 of the intervention (Table 2). At week 1, the NP
and the HP groups consumed 0.80 6 0.02 g kg1 day1 and 1.40 6
0.02 g kg1 day1 of protein, respectively (P < 0.001). At week 12,
the NP group consumed 0.88 g kg1 day1 and the HP group
consumed 1.55 g kg1 day1 of protein as subjects lost weight
(P < 0.001). The apparent increase in protein intake from week 1 to
12 was due to reduced body weight among subjects; the quantity of
protein each subject consumed remained constant over time.
BUN concentration, which reflects the amount of dietary protein
consumed, was not statistically different between the NP (16 6
1 mg dL1) and HP (17 6 1 mg dL1) groups at baseline. At the end
of the study, BUN decreased in the NP group (1.7 6 0.7 mg dL1)
and increased in the HP group (þ1.7 6 0.8 mg dL1), consistent
with different dietary protein intakes during the intervention (group-
by-time interaction P < 0.01).
Body weight and body composition changes. Subjects lost
weight and body fat (P < 0.0001), independent of dietary protein
(Table 1). The HP group lost less lean body mass compared with
the NP group (Table 1, group-by-time interaction P < 0.05).
Android/gynoid fat ratio decreased in both NP (0.05 6 0.02) and
HP (0.08 6 0.01) groups (P < 0.05).
Resting energy expenditure and substrate oxidation. Resting
energy expenditure (REE) decreased (P < 0.05) from baseline to
postintervention, independent of dietary protein. There was a trend
of linear relation between the changes of lean body mass (kg) and
REE (kcal, REE ¼ 15.0 þ 67.1  lean body mass, P ¼ 0.06). Pro-
tein oxidation decreased in the NP group from baseline to post-inter-
vention (0.062 6 0.008 vs. 0.037 6 0.004 g min1, P < 0.05) but
did not change in the HP group (0.066 6 0.006 vs. 0.055 6 0.006 g
min1). Fat oxidation increased overtime in NP (0.032 6 0.005 vs.
0.049 6 0.006 g min1, P < 0.05) but not in HP group (0.035 6
0.006 vs. 0.040 6 0.004 g min1). Carbohydrate oxidation did not
change in either NP (0.187 6 0.021 vs. 0.160 6 0.015 g min1) or
HP (0.178 6 0.011 vs. 0.179 6 0.010 g min1) groups.
Cardiovascular, metabolic, and kidney disease risk factors.
At baseline, no statistically significant differences between groups
were observed for parameters of metabolic syndrome and kidney
health (Table 3). Blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C,
and triacylglycerol) decreased over time (P < 0.001), independent
of dietary protein. Although HDL-C decreased, cholesterol/HDL
also significantly decreased. The insulin and glucose concentrations
decreased and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) improved in both the
NP and HP groups (P < 0.05). In addition, blood pressure decreased
over time (P < 0.01), independent of dietary protein.
Serum creatinine decreased in the NP group only (group-by-time
interaction: P < 0.05). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) remained
unchanged over time in the HP group and increased in the NP group
(Table 4, group-by-time interaction: P < 0.05).
BMI classification. Subjects were retrospectively grouped accord-
ing to their baseline BMI as overweight (BMI ¼ 25.0-29.9 kg m2)
or obese (BMI  30.0 kg m2). The overweight group (n ¼ 17,
40% of subjects) had a lower BMI (overweight: 28.4 6 0.4 vs.
obese: 33.9 6 0.5 kg m2), body weight (overweight: 91.4 6 2.1
vs. obese 109.2 6 1.9 kg), fat mass (overweight: 29.5 6 1.2 vs.
obese: 40.0 6 1.1 kg) and lean body mass (overweight: 58.5 6 1.4
vs. obese: 65.6 6 1.3 kg) than the obese group (n ¼ 26, 60% of
subjects) at baseline (P < 0.001). After weight loss, the obese group
lost more body weight (10.8 6 0.6 kg vs. 8.5 6 0.7 kg) and fat
mass (8.0 6 0.4 kg vs. 6.5 6 0.5) than the overweight group,
and
dietary

did
not
influence
these
responses
(Table 4). The effects of protein and BMI status on lean body mass
loss were additive: the HP group lost less lean body mass than the
NP group and the overweight group lost less lean body mass than
the obese group. The effect of BMI status on the changes in body
composition was not statistically confirmed when the responses
were expressed as a % of total body weight loss or % loss of base-
line tissue mass (Table 4).
Triacylglycerol concentration was higher in the obese group (245 6
36 mg dL1) compared with the overweight group (133 6 14 mg
dL1, P < 0.05) at baseline. After weight loss, the obese group had
a greater triacylglycerol decrease than the overweight group (105
6 22 vs. 32 6 29 mg dL1, respectively, P < 0.05). BMI status
did not affect other cardiovascular/metabolic markers, HOMA-IR,
kidney function, blood pressures, REE or substrate oxidation (data
not shown).

Discussion
Debates continue regarding the optimal macronutrient distribution to
achieve weight loss. In the current study, both the NP and HP
groups lost comparable body weight. This finding is consistent with
the previous study conducted by our group in overweight and obese
women using a similar experimental design (17) and other studies
with similar intervention length (7,8,24). However, results from lon-
ger-term studies are inconclusive. Some studies found that an
energy-restricted diet with higher-protein content resulted in greater
weight loss (25,26), while others found no effect of dietary protein
on weight loss (27,28). A 2-year weight-loss study showed that the
macronutrient distribution of the diets did not influence weight loss
(29). That study (29) had a large sample size, a high retention rate
and a diverse population, which helped minimize non-nutritional
influences on the results. One recent, controlled-feeding study com-
paring protein quantity and sources on weight loss found neither
quantity nor source of protein was associated with weight or fat loss
in adults (12). Collectively, it appears that when energy intake is
controlled, macronutrient distribution does not affect the amount of
weight loss that can be achieved.
Primary goals of weight loss trials are to maximize body fat reduc-
tion and to reduce the indices of metabolic syndrome (2). However,
energy restriction-induced weight loss also results in the loss of lean
body mass. Lean body mass, primarily muscle, is essential for per-
forming physical functions (30). Results from different weight-loss
trials showed that consuming more protein during weight loss can
help attenuate lean body mass loss (7,17,31). Specifically, consum-
ing a higher-protein diet (1.6 g kg1 day1) for 10 weeks lead to
0.9 kg less lean body mass loss compared to consuming a normal-
protein diet (0.8 g kg1 day1) (7). Overweight and obese men in
the current study who consumed 1.4 vs. 0.8 g kg1 day1 of protein
for 12 weeks lost 1.1 kg less lean body mass. We found a compara-
ble lean body mass preservation (1.3 kg less loss) with a higher pro-
tein diet in overweight and obese women with similar study design
(17). Alternatively, results from a 12-week weight-loss study (8)
showed the reduction of lean mass loss with higher protein diet was
observed in women, but not in men. The authors speculated that the
higher-protein diet was not sufficient enough to preserve lean body
mass in men (1.1 g kg1 day1 in men vs. 1.4 g kg1 day1 of pro-
tein in women) (8). A meta-regression (9) showed that lean body
mass retention increases with each quartile of protein intake: a sig-
nificant difference existed between the upper two quartiles (>1.05 g
kg1 day1) and the first quartile (<0.7 g kg1 day1). Thus, the
difference of protein intakes between the higher- and lower-protein
diets could also contribute to the observed difference in lean body
mass retention. Consuming a weight-loss diet with protein at the
RDA level may not be sufficient to preserve lean body mass but the
evaluation of the optimal protein intake during energy restriction in
terms of lean body mass retention still needs to be done.
REE comprises 60-70% of total energy expenditure (2) and lean
body mass is a predominant contributor to REE (32,33). Thus, a die-
tary regimen that would help preserve, or attenuate the loss of lean
body mass after weight loss is desirable for subsequent weight main-
tenance. Some research found that a higher-protein diet (10) lead to
a less REE reduction after weight loss while others did not (34). In
the current study, REE decreased over time among all subjects inde-
pendent of dietary protein, with a trend of linear relation between
the changes of REE and lean body mass. A recent systematic review
found that lean body mass was not associated with the changes
of REE and may not be suitable to predict REE with energy-
restriction-induced weight loss (35).
Protein from animal sources usually contain higher amounts of cho-
lesterol and saturated fat, which may increase blood lipid concentra-
tion and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (17). In the current
study, total cholesterol HDL-C, LDL-C and triacylglycerol all
decreased, independent of dietary protein, which was consistent with
our previous research in women (17) and research by others (7,28).
Collectively, these findings suggest weight loss is a stronger factor
in lowering blood lipids than quantity and source of protein con-
sumed during the period of energy restriction.
There is little evidence to support that higher-protein diets may
impact renal function in healthy individuals (36). The current study
showed that GFR in the subjects from the HP group did not change
over time, which was consistent with other studies (7,17). It appears
that subjects from the NP group had improved kidney functions with
an increase in GFR. However, the only variable in GFR formula is
serum creatinine concentration and the NP group decreased creati-
nine concentration overtime. It is likely that the decrease in creati-
nine in the NP group was attributable to a reduction of the creatine
pool due to consuming a meat-free diet during the intervention,
compared to the subjects’ habitual omnivorous diets.
The obese subjects lost more body weight and fat mass than the
overweight subjects in kg, indicating the amount of weight loss may
be affected by the degree of energy restriction as well as obesity sta-
tus. In terms of lean body mass loss, the overweight group had a
greater preservation of lean body mass (kg) compared with the
obese group, which was consistent with our previous study in
women (17). However, subjects had similar reductions in percent
loss which suggest BMI status did not affect the magnitude of body
composition changes. These findings are contrary to the findings of
our previous study in women which showed that the effect of BMI
status maintained for percentage comparisons. Whether there is a
gender difference still needs further investigation.
Both subjective and objective measures were used to assess compli-
ance in this study. A 750 kcal daily energy deficit should lead to
9.2 kg weight loss over 12 weeks in theory, assuming 25% loss is
lean body mass and 75% is fat mass (37). Subjects’ average weight
loss was 9.8 6 0.49 kg, among which 7.38 6 0.35 kg (75%) was
fat mass. Subjects were required to come to the laboratory twice
weekly to record their body weight and return the daily food check-
off lists. These strategies were very effective in monitoring subjects’
weight change and dietary adherence. The findings that BUN
increased in the HP group and decreased in the NP group also sup-
ports the subjects’ compliance, and that habitual dietary protein
intakes in these subjects were between 0.8 (RDA) and 1.4 g kg1
day1. The decrease in total protein intake from baseline for the NP
group is consistent with what would occur when a person decreases
the quantity but does not change the macronutrient distribution of
their usual diet to achieve weight loss. This reduced protein intake
might have influenced the body composition responses with weight
loss, but another ‘‘control’’ group that maintained their total protein
intake while losing weight would be required to evaluate this possi-
bility. Because the protein contents of the NP and HP diets were dif-
ferent not only in quantity, but in food sources and quality (animal
vs. plant protein), it is not possible to attribute the differential

responses between diet groups specifically to one of these factors. In
addition, different fat composition between the two diets due to dif-
ferent protein sources (animal vs. plant) may also impact the out-
come measures.
In conclusion, overweight and obese men who consumed a 750 kcal
energy deficient diet for 12 weeks successfully lost weight and
improved indices of metabolic syndrome. Although the amount of
weight loss does not depend on macronutrient distribution, consump-
tion of a higher-protein, energy-restricted diet can attenuate lean
body mass loss during weight loss compared with an isocaloric
normal-protein diet. The metabolic and physiological impacts of
retaining more lean body mass are not evident with respect to REE
and improvements in clinical health parameters that comprise meta-
bolic syndrome.O
