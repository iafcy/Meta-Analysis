Participants were evaluated at baseline and 22 weeks.\n## RESULTS\nForty-three percent (21 of 49) of the vegan group and 26% (13 of 50) of the ADA group participants reduced diabetes medications. Including all participants, HbA(1c) (A1C) decreased 0.96 percentage points in the vegan group and 0.56 points in the ADA group (P = 0.089). Excluding those who changed medications, A1C fell 1.23 points in the vegan group compared with 0.38 points in the ADA group (P = 0.01). Body weight decreased 6.5 kg in the vegan group and 3.1 kg in the ADA group (P < 0.001). Body weight change correlated with A1C change (r = 0.51, n = 57, P < 0.0001). Among those who did not change lipid-lowering medications, LDL cholesterol fell 21.2% in the vegan group and 10.7% in the ADA group (P = 0.02). After adjustment for baseline values, urinary albumin reductions were greater in the vegan group (15.9 mg/24 h) than in the ADA group (10.9 mg/24 h) (P = 0.013).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nBoth a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on ADA guidelines improved glycemic and lipid control in type 2 diabetic patients.

Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A(1c)) and plasma lipids were assessed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74. Weight was measured at weeks 0, 22, and 74.\n## RESULTS\nWeight loss was significant within each diet group but not significantly different between groups (-4.4 kg in the vegan group and -3.0 kg in the conventional diet group, P = 0.25) and related significantly to Hb A(1c) changes (r = 0.50, P = 0.001).

Body weight, plasma lipids, blood pressure, and body composition (dual X-ray absorptiometry) were measured. Secondary measures included insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment, HOMA-IR), oral glucose insulin sensitivity (OGIS), and predicted insulin sensitivity (PREDIM) indices. Thereafter, participants were asked to return to their baseline diets for 4 weeks, after which they began the opposite diet for 16 weeks. The same parameters were measured before and after this 2nd 16-week period.Results: Overall net weight changes were 0.0 (Mediterranean) and -6.0 kg (vegan), (treatment effect -6.0 kg [95% CI -7.5 to -4.5]; p < 0.001).

Because a low-fat plant-based diet has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that such a diet would reduce painful symptoms of diabetic neuropathy.\n## METHODS\nIn this 20-week pilot study, individuals with type 2 diabetes and painful diabetic neuropathy were randomly assigned to two groups. The intervention group was asked to follow a low-fat, plant-based diet, with weekly classes for support in following the prescribed diet, and to take a vitamin B12 supplement. The control group was asked to take the same vitamin B12 supplement, but received no other intervention. At baseline, midpoint and 20 weeks, clinical, laboratory and questionnaire data were collected. Questionnaires included an analog 'worst pain' scale, Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, global impression scale, Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Neuropathy Total Symptom Score, a weekly pain diary and Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n## RESULTS\nAfter 20 weeks, body weight change with the intervention was -6.4\u2009kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -9.4 to -3.4, P<0.001) in an effect size analysis. Electrochemical skin conductance in the foot improved by an average of 12.4 microseimens (95% CI 1.2-23.6, P=0.03) with the intervention in an effect size analysis.

This article reports the differences in outcomes between diet groups after the first 6 months of the intervention.\n## RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES\nThe study used a four-group design. Subjects (n = 182) were randomized to a treatment preference group and then to a dietary treatment group. For this report, preference groups were combined to permit comparisons by dietary treatment only (SBT, n = 98; SBT+LOV, n = 84). Additional analyses compared SBT+LOV subjects who were 100% adherent (did not consume any meat, fish, or poultry, n = 47) to those who were <100% adherent (n = 24).\n## RESULTS\nSignificant differences were seen in the baseline to 6-month change scores between the two groups for carbohydrate consumption (p = 0.013), protein consumption (p < 0.001), polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio (p = 0.009), and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level (p = 0.013).

SBT+LOV subjects who were 100% adherent were more successful at both weight loss and cholesterol reduction than those who were <100% adherent, suggesting that vegetarian diets are efficacious for weight and cholesterol control.\n",

Given that pharmacotherapy has limited available options and that bariatric surgery is reserved for those who are morbidly obese or who have significant comorbidities, the most common approach to the treatment of obesity is standard behavioral treatment. This approach includes behavior modification related to eating and activity habits. The purpose of this paper is to describe the rationale, design, methods and baseline sample characteristics of a randomized controlled trial of a behavioral intervention in weight loss management, referred to as the PREFER study.\n## METHODS\nThe PREFER study, using a four-group design, includes: (1) a randomization scheme that permits participants to indicate a preferred dietary treatment approach, and (2) two dietary options, one of which is a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet that has demonstrated potential for long-term adherence. The intervention (32 treatment sessions) is delivered over 12 months and is followed by a 6-month maintenance phase; final assessment occurs at 18 months.\n## RESULTS\nWe screened 932 individuals and randomized 197 to the study: Treatment Preference-Yes (n=84) and Treatment Preference-No (n=98). To maintain a balance across the four treatment groups, 15 subjects who preferred the standard diet had to be discarded from the Treatment Preference-Yes group. Retention at 18 months for the first of three cohorts was 82%.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThe PREFER study is a single center study and is the first randomized controlled trial examining a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet as part of weight loss treatment. The ethnically diverse sample includes males and females with a body mass index of 27 to 43. The study has the potential to make a contribution to understanding the role of treatment preference and the potential of a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet for long-term weight loss.\n",

Seventy-four patients with Type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to either the experimental group (n = 37), which received a vegetarian diet, or the control group (n = 37), which received a conventional diabetic diet. Both diets were isocaloric, calorie restricted (-500 kcal/day). All meals during the study were provided. The second 12 weeks of the diet were combined with aerobic exercise. Participants were examined at baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were: insulin sensitivity measured by hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic clamp; volume of visceral and subcutaneous fat measured by magnetic resonance imaging; and oxidative stress measured by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. Analyses were by intention to treat.\n## RESULTS\nForty-three per cent of participants in the experimental group and 5% of participants in the control group reduced diabetes medication (P < 0.001). Body weight decreased more in the experimental group than in the control group [-6.2 kg (95% CI -6.6 to -5.3) vs. -3.2 kg (95% CI -3.7 to -2.5); interaction group \u00d7 time P = 0.001]. An increase in insulin sensitivity was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group [30% (95% CI 24.5-39) vs. 20% (95% CI 14-25), P = 0.04]. A reduction in both visceral and subcutaneous fat was greater in the experimental group than in the control group (P = 0.007 and P = 0.02, respectively). Plasma adiponectin increased (P = 0.02) and leptin decreased (P = 0.02) in the experimental group, with no change in the control group.

Differences between groups were greater after the addition of exercise training. Changes in insulin sensitivity and enzymatic oxidative stress markers correlated with changes in visceral fat.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nA calorie-restricted vegetarian diet had greater capacity to improve insulin sensitivity compared with a conventional diabetic diet over 24 weeks. The greater loss of visceral fat and improvements in plasma concentrations of adipokines and oxidative stress markers with this diet may be responsible for the reduction of insulin resistance. The addition of exercise training further augmented the improved outcomes with the vegetarian diet.\n",

The intervention group (n\u2009=\u2009122) was asked to follow a low-fat vegan diet and the control group (n\u2009=\u2009122) to make no diet changes for 16 weeks.\n## MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nAt weeks 0 and 16, body weight was assessed using a calibrated scale. Body composition and visceral fat were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. Insulin resistance was assessed with the homeostasis model assessment index and the predicted insulin sensitivity index (PREDIM). Thermic effect of food was measured by indirect calorimetry over 3 hours after a standard liquid breakfast (720 kcal). In a subset of participants (n\u2009=\u200944), hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipids were quantified by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used for statistical analysis.\n## RESULTS\nAmong the 244 participants in the study, 211 (87%) were female, 117 (48%) were White, and the mean (SD) age was 54.4 (11.6) years. Over the 16 weeks, body weight decreased in the intervention group by 5.9 kg (95% CI, 5.0-6.7 kg; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Thermic effect of food increased in the intervention group by 14.1% (95% CI, 6.5-20.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001). The homeostasis model assessment index decreased (-1.3; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.3; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and PREDIM increased (0.9; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in the intervention group. Hepatocellular lipid levels decreased in the intervention group by 34.4%, from a mean (SD) of 3.2% (2.9%) to 2.4% (2.2%) (P\u2009=\u2009.002), and intramyocellular lipid levels decreased by 10.4%, from a mean (SD) of 1.6 (1.1) to 1.5 (1.0) (P\u2009=\u2009.03). None of these variables changed significantly in the control group over the 16 weeks. The change in PREDIM correlated negatively with the change in body weight (r\u2009=\u2009-0.43; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Changes in hepatocellular and intramyocellular lipid levels correlated with changes in insulin resistance (both r\u2009=\u20090.51; P\u2009=\u2009.01).\n## CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nA low-fat plant-based dietary intervention reduces body weight by reducing energy intake and increasing postprandial metabolism. The changes are associated with reductions in hepatocellular and intramyocellular fat and increased insulin sensitivity.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02939638.\n",

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nSeveral intervention studies have suggested that vegetarian or vegan diets have clinical benefits, particularly in terms of glycemic control, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, no randomized controlled trial has been conducted in Asians who more commonly depend on plant-based foods, as compared to Western populations. Here, we aimed to compare the effect of a vegan diet and conventional diabetic diet on glycemic control among Korean individuals.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nParticipants diagnosed with T2D were randomly assigned to follow either a vegan diet (excluding animal-based food including fish; n = 46) or a conventional diet recommended by the Korean Diabetes Association 2011 (n = 47) for 12 weeks. HbA1c levels were measured at weeks 0, 4, and 12, and the primary study endpoint was the change in HbA1c levels over 12 weeks.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean HbA1c levels at weeks 0, 4, and 12 were 7.7%, 7.2%, and 7.1% in the vegan group, and 7.4%, 7.2%, and 7.2% in the conventional group, respectively. Although both groups showed significant reductions in HbA1C levels, the reductions were larger in the vegan group than in the conventional group (-0.5% vs. -0.2%; p-for-interaction = 0.017). When only considering participants with high compliance, the difference in HbA1c level reduction between the groups was found to be larger (-0.9% vs. -0.3%). The beneficial effect of vegan diets was noted even after adjusting for changes in total energy intake or waist circumference over the 12 weeks.\n## CONCLUSION\nBoth diets led to reductions in HbA1c levels; however, glycemic control was better with the vegan diet than with the conventional diet. Thus, the dietary guidelines for patients with T2D should include a vegan diet for the better management and treatment. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of a vegan diet, and to identify potential explanations of the underlying mechanisms.\n## TRIAL REGISTRATION\nCRiS KCT0001771.\n",

A total of 100 subjects will be included and randomly assigned to two groups: Mediterranean calorie-restricted diet (n\u2009=\u200950) and vegetarian calorie-restricted diet (n\u2009=\u200950). The intervention phases will last 3\u00a0months each, and at the end of intervention phase I the groups will be crossed over. The two diets will be isocaloric and of three different sizes (1400 - 1600 - 1800\u00a0kcal/day), according to specific energy requirements. Adherence to the dietary intervention will be established through questionnaires and 24-h dietary recall. Anthropometric measurements, body composition, blood samples and stool samples will be obtained from each participant at the beginning and at the end of each intervention phase. The primary outcome measure will be change in weight from baseline. The secondary outcome measures will be variations of anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance variables as well as traditional and innovative cardiovascular biomarkers.\n## DISCUSSION\nDespite all the data supporting the efficacy of Mediterranean and vegetarian diets on the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, no studies have directly compared these two dietary profiles.

The HP group lost less lean body mass than the NP group (-1.9 \u00b1 0.3 vs. -3.0 \u00b1 0.4 kg). The effects of protein and BMI status on lean body mass loss were additive. The reductions in total cholesterol, HDL-C, triacylglycerol, glucose, and insulin, along with LDL-C, total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio, and HOMA-IR, were not statistically different between NP and HP. Likewise, macronutrient distributions of the diet did not affect the reductions in REE, and blood pressure. In conclusion, energy restriction effectively improves multiple clinical indicators of cardiovascular health and glucose control, and consumption of a higher-protein diet and accomplishing weight loss when overweight versus obese help men preserve lean body mass over a short period of time.\n",

            "abstract": "The Women's Lifestyle Heart Trial was a small (N = 28) randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of a comprehensive lifestyle self-management program (very low-fat vegetarian diet, stress-management training, exercise, group support, and smoking cessation) on reduction of cardiovascular risk factors in postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease (CHD). Women assigned to the treatment condition (Prime Time) participated in a week-long retreat followed by twice-weekly 4-hour meetings. Endpoints were program adherence; changes in lipid profiles, body mass, blood pressure, hypolipidemic and antihypertensive medications; and quality of life. Risk factor and psychosocial evaluations were conducted at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Repeated measures analyses of covariance revealed that the dietary, stress management, and physical activity changes made by intervention women were dramatic and lasting. There were significantly greater improvements in the Prime Time condition compared to the usual care control group on body mass, angina symptoms, and quality of life, and a tendency for a greater reduction in blood pressure-lowering medications. Similar patterns were seen in lipids, blood pressure, and lipid-lowering medications, but did not reach significance. These results demonstrate that postmenopausal CHD women can make lasting lifestyle changes, and that these changes may reduce the need for cardiac medications and improve CHD risk factors and quality of life.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE\nThere is little randomised evidence using a whole food plant-based (WFPB) diet as intervention for elevated body mass index (BMI) or dyslipidaemia. We investigated the effectiveness of a community-based dietary programme. Primary end points: BMI and cholesterol at 6 months (subsequently extended).\n## SUBJECTS\nAges 35-70, from one general practice in Gisborne, New Zealand. Diagnosed with obesity or overweight and at least one of type 2 diabetes, ischaemic heart disease, hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia. Of 65 subjects randomised (control n=32, intervention n=33), 49 (75.4%) completed the study to 6 months. Twenty-three (70%) intervention participants were followed up at 12 months.\n## METHODS\nAll participants received normal care. Intervention participants attended facilitated meetings twice-weekly for 12 weeks, and followed a non-energy-restricted WFPB diet with vitamin B\n## RESULTS\nAt 6 months, mean BMI reduction was greater with the WFPB diet compared with normal care (4.4 vs 0.4, difference: 3.9\u2009kg\u2009m\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis programme led to significant improvements in BMI, cholesterol and other risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, this research has achieved greater weight loss at 6 and 12 months than any other trial that does not limit energy intake or mandate regular exercise.\n",
