            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Combined androgen blockade (CAB) and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist monotherapy are commonly used in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to compare the two methods of ADT in terms of quality of life (QOL).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Eighty patients who underwent primary ADT for newly diagnosed prostate cancer were randomly assigned to CAB group (Group 1) and LHRH agonist monotherapy group (Group 2). Leuprolide and anti-androgen (bicalutamide 50 mg) were used to minimize the confounding effects caused by medication. QOL was evaluated at baseline, 3 months and 6 months post-ADT using validated EORTC QLQ-C30, PR25, and depression questionnaires. A difference of > 10 points in the EORTC domain scores was defined as 'clinically significant'.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the baseline characteristics, there was no significant difference between the two groups. At 3 months after ADT, Group 1 had significantly lower pain scores than Group 2 (p = 0.004), while Group 1 had significantly poorer diarrhea symptom score than Group 2, without clinical significance (p = 0.047). No significant differences were observed in the C30, PR25 domains, and the depression score at 3 months. At 6 months, the QOL scores of all the groups were similar.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      There was no difference in the patient's QOL, except that CAB group was associated with significantly better pain relief than LHRH agonist monotherapy at 3 months following ADT, which was not sustained thereafter. Our results suggest that the benefit of prolonged (≥ 3 months) CAB is questionable in terms of patients' QOL."

Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and had high-volume metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. Previous chemotherapy or other localised treatment for prostate cancer were not allowed. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ADT plus either rezvilutamide (240 mg) or bicalutamide (50 mg) orally once daily. Randomisation was done via an interactive response technology system (block size of four) and stratified according to ECOG performance status and presence of visceral metastasis (excluding lymph nodes). Herein, we present the results of the preplanned interim analyses for the two co-primary endpoints of radiographic progression-free survival assessed by a blinded independent review committee and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.

Large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 were identified in 49 families; and in BRCA2 in 7 families, representing ~11% of mutations in BRCA1/BRCA2 in Ireland. The most common large genomic rearrangement in BRCA1 was deletion of exons 1-23 (11 families, 7 from Co. Galway). Other common mutations included deletions of exon 3 (8 families) and exons 1-2 (6 families). Deletion of exons 19-20 in BRCA2 represented the familial mutation in five families, all from East Ireland (Wexford/Wicklow/Dublin). It is evident that a significant proportion of highly penetrant pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 will be missed if testing is limited to PCR-based Sanger sequencing alone. Screening for large genomic rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the routine diagnostic workflow is critical to avoid false negative results."

We evaluated the impact of these health care-related changes on cancer staging by comparing cancers staged before and during the pandemic.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a retrospective cohort study at London Health Sciences Centre and St. Joseph's Health Care London, London, Ontario, Canada. We evaluated all pathologically staged breast, colorectal, prostate, endometrial and lung cancers (the 5 most common cancers by site, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) over a 3-year period (Mar. 15, 2018-Mar. 14, 2021). The pre-COVID-19 group included procedures performed between Mar. 15, 2018, and Mar. 14, 2020, and the COVID-19 group included procedures performed between Mar. 15, 2020, and Mar. 14, 2021. The primary outcome was cancer stage group, based on the pathologic tumour, lymph node, metastasis system. We performed univariate analyses to compare demographic characteristics, pathologic features and cancer stage between the 2 groups. We performed multivariable ordinal regression analyses using the proportional odds model to evaluate the association between stage and timing of staging (before v. during the pandemic).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were 4055 cases across the 5 cancer sites. The average number of breast cancer staging procedures per 30 days increased during the pandemic compared to the yearly average in the pre-COVID-19 period (41.3 v. 39.6), whereas decreases were observed for endometrial cancer (15.9 v. 16.4), colorectal cancer (21.8 v. 24.3), prostate cancer (13.6 v. 18.5) and lung cancer (11.5 v. 15.9). For all cancer sites, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics, pathologic features or cancer stage between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). In multivariable regression analysis, for all cancer sites, cases staged during the pandemic were not associated with higher stage (breast: odds ratio [OR] 1.071, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.826-1.388; colorectal: OR 1.201, 95% CI 0.869-1.661; endometrium: OR 0.792, 95% CI 0.495-1.252; prostate: OR 1.171, 95% CI 0.765-1.794; and lung: OR 0.826, 95% CI 0.535-1.262).\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Cancer cases staged during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were not associated with higher stage; this likely reflects the prioritization of cancer procedures during times of reduced capacity. The impact of the pandemic period on staging procedures varied between cancer sites, which may reflect differences in clinical presentation, detection and treatment."

Median patient age at diagnosis was three years (IQR 1-5). On Poisson regression, the year of diagnosis, patient age, tumor size and laterality, and stage were found to impact LN yield. For patients with positive LNs, five-year OS of patients with LNDs above 0.4 was worse than those below 0.4 (76.1% vs 89.6%, p = 0.041). On multivariable analysis, tumor size and LND remained significant predictors of OS.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Administrative databases such as SEER provide an excellent resource for studying conditions where large patient numbers for analysis are difficult to obtain. Unfortunately, the SEER database is unable to account for every factor that could affect LN sampling patterns. Additionally, favorable vs unfavorable histology is not available in SEER, and SEER utilizes its own staging system, which makes comparison to Children's Oncology Group staging difficult. Despite these limitations, the findings of this study are similar to those previously published using administrative databases analyzing LN sampling patterns and the effect of LND on OS in WT.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Analysis of the SEER database confirms that there are several patient- and disease-specific factors that affect the number of LNs sampled during nephrectomy for WT, and that LND may be a predictor of OS.

In this study, we sought to elucidate the association between ALAN and prostate cancer in 27 districts within Gwangju City and urban and rural areas from South Jeolla Province in South Korea. We analyzed the correlation between ALAN and the incidence of a range of cancers by Poisson regression analysis, after adjustment for confounding risk factors, such as smoking, drinking, obesity, stress, air pollution (particulate matter <10 μm in diameter), urbanization (proportion of urbanized area), and the cancer screening rate. Interestingly, the incidence of prostate cancer was significantly associated with ALAN (risk ratio = 1.02, p = 0.0369) and urbanization (risk ratio = 1.06, p = 0.0055). In particular, comparing the prostate cancer incidence at 25% and 75% level of ALAN, the risk ratio was 1.726 (12.6 over 7.3, respectively). No significant association was observed between ALAN and other cancers, including stomach, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, laryngeal, lung and tracheal, bladder, and brain and central nervous system cancers, as well as lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In conclusion, this study shows that a high incidence of prostate cancer may be independently associated with light pollution and urbanization, which represent significant factors in the rapid process of industrialization of South Korea."

After purifying urine samples with SPE, 18 metabolites were separated on a C18 column, and MS detection was performed. The UPLC-MS/MS method has been proven effective at evaluating bisphenol and phthalate exposure (0.020-0.20 μg/L of the limits of detection, 71.8 %∼119.4 % of recoveries, 0.4 %∼8.2 % of precision). Logistic regression explored the association between exposure level and PCa in 187 PCa cases and 151 controls.

Since prostate cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and retroperitoneal sarcomas such as liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma are known to be radioresistant tumors, carbon-ion radiotherapy, which provides the advantageous radiobiological properties such as an increasing relative biological effectiveness toward the Bragg peak, a reduced oxygen enhancement ratio, and a reduced dependence on fractionation and cell-cycle stage, has been tested for these urological tumors at the National Institute for Radiological Sciences since 1994. To promote carbon-ion radiotherapy as a standard cancer therapy, the Japan Carbon-ion Radiation Oncology Study Group was established in 2015 to create a registry of all treated patients and conduct multi-institutional prospective studies in cooperation with all the Japanese institutes. Based on accumulating evidence of the efficacy and feasibility of carbon-ion therapy for prostate cancer and retroperitoneal sarcoma, it is now covered by the Japanese health insurance system. On the other hand, carbon-ion radiotherapy for renal cell cancer is not still covered by the insurance system, although the two previous studies showed the efficacy.

Seventy-three percent of all prescriptions required 2 or more phone calls by clinic staff and 40% required 5 or more calls. Of 107 prescriptions with data available, 54% utilized financial assistance; these required significantly more phone calls (P = .0001) and led to a longer median time to drug obtainment (P = .003) compared with those that did not require financial assistance. In those prescriptions with both initial and final co-pay information available, the initial out-of-pocket mean and median co-pays were $1226.03 and $329.73, respectively, but these dropped to $124.57 and $25.00 after utilization of co-pay assistance programs, excluding those with a $0 final co-pay.

Unfortunately, 10-46% of patients may still suffer from limited erectile function (EF) after RARP. This study aimed to develop a prediction model based on the extent of fascia preservation (FP) and postoperative EF after RARP. A previously developed FP score quantizing the extent and regions of nerve-preservation was determined in a cohort of 1241 patients who underwent RARP. The predictive value of the FP score for post-prostatectomy EF (following the international index erectile function (IIEF) score, EF domain) was analyzed. To increase the predictive value of the scoring system, the FP regions were related to postoperative EF, nerve distribution and co-morbidity factors. Finally, a prediction model for EF was developed based on the studied cohort. When corrected for the preoperative IIEF-EF, the FP score was shown to be a significant denominator for IIEF (p = 2.5 × 10- 15) with an R2 of 35%. Variable selection performed using the Akaike information criterion led to a final prediction model for postoperative IIEF after nerve-preservation based on the FP score. Furthermore, patient's age, preoperative IIEF score, CCIS and use of clips for nerve sparing were significantly associated with postoperative IIEF-EF. More anterior fascia preservation was correlated with better EF outcome and age was a strong independent predictor of EF outcome. In older men, the relative benefit of more extensive fascia preservation was at least similar to younger men, despite a lower baseline IIEF-EF score. Quantitative nerve-sparing FP scoring could be related to the postoperative IIEF-EF and integrated into a multivariate prediction model, which includes with age, use of surgical clips, the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score (CCIS), and preoperative IIEF-EF. When further validated the prediction model could provide patients and care-givers a qualitative estimation of EF outcome after RARP."

            "abstract": "The prevalence and biological consequences of deleterious germline variants in urothelial cancer (UC) are not fully characterized. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) of germline DNA and 157 primary and metastatic tumors from 80 UC patients. We developed a computational framework for identifying putative deleterious germline variants (pDGVs) from WES data. Here, we show that UC patients harbor a high prevalence of pDGVs that truncate tumor suppressor proteins. Deepening somatic loss of heterozygosity in serial tumor samples is observed, suggesting a critical role for these pDGVs in tumor progression. Significant intra-patient heterogeneity in germline-somatic variant interactions results in divergent biological pathway alterations between primary and metastatic tumors. Our results characterize the spectrum of germline variants in UC and highlight their roles in shaping the natural history of the disease. These findings could have broad clinical implications for cancer patients."

            "abstract": "An excess incidence of prostate cancer has been identified among World Trade Center (WTC) responders. In this study, we hypothesized that WTC dust, which contained carcinogens and tumor-promoting agents, could facilitate prostate cancer development by inducing DNA damage, promoting cell proliferation, and causing chronic inflammation. We compared expression of immunologic and inflammatory genes using a NanoString assay on archived prostate tumors from WTC Health Program (WTCHP) patients and non-WTC patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, to assess immediate and delayed responses of prostate tissue to acute WTC dust exposure via intratracheal inhalation, we performed RNA-seq on the prostate of normal rats that were exposed to moderate to high doses of WTC dust. WTC prostate cancer cases showed significant upregulation of genes involved in DNA damage and G2-M arrest. Cell-type enrichment analysis showed that Th17 cells, a subset of proinflammatory Th cells, were specifically upregulated in WTC patients. In rats exposed to WTC dust, we observed upregulation of gene transcripts of cell types involved in both adaptive immune response (dendritic cells and B cells) and inflammatory response (Th17 cells) in the prostate. Unexpectedly, genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway were also significantly upregulated 30 days after acute dust exposure. Our results suggest that respiratory exposure to WTC dust can induce inflammatory and immune responses in prostate tissue. IMPLICATIONS: WTC-related prostate cancer displayed a distinct gene expression pattern that could be the result of exposure to specific carcinogens. Our data warrant further epidemiologic and cellular mechanistic studies to better understand the consequences of WTC dust exposure.Visual Overview: http://mcr.aacrjournals.org/content/molcanres/17/8/1605/F1.large.jpg."

However, durable benefit is only achieved in a small, yet uncharacterized patient subset. NECTIN4 is located on chromosome 1q23.3, and 1q23.3 gains represent frequent copy number variations (CNVs) in urothelial cancer. Here, we aimed to evaluate NECTIN4 amplifications as a genomic biomarker to predict EV response in patients with mUC.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      We established a NECTIN4-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay to assess the predictive value of NECTIN4 CNVs in a multicenter EV-treated mUC patient cohort (mUC-EV, n = 108). CNVs were correlated with membranous NECTIN4 protein expression, EV treatment responses, and outcomes. We also assessed the prognostic value of NECTIN4 CNVs measured in metastatic biopsies of non-EV-treated mUC (mUC-non-EV, n = 103).

In mUC-EV, NECTIN4 amplification represents a stable genomic alteration during metastatic progression and associates with enhanced membranous NECTIN4 protein expression. Ninety-six percent (27 of 28) of patients with NECTIN4 amplifications demonstrated objective responses to EV compared with 32% (24 of 74) in the nonamplified subgroup (P < .001). In multivariable Cox analysis adjusted for age, sex, and Bellmunt risk factors, NECTIN4 amplifications led to a 92% risk reduction for death (hazard ratio, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.02 to 0.34]; P < .001).

LDR brachytherapy boost in combination with external beam radiation therapy is appropriate for unfavorable intermediate risk and high-risk disease. Androgen deprivation therapy is recommended in unfavorable intermediate risk and high-risk disease. Acceptable radionuclides for LDR brachytherapy include iodine-125, palladium-103, and cesium-131. Although brachytherapy monotherapy is associated with increased urinary obstructive and irritative symptoms that peak within the first 3 months after treatment, the median time toward symptom resolution is approximately 1 year for iodine-125 and 6 months for palladium-103.

Pathological diagnosis through cytoscopic biopsy is the gold standard, whereas non-invasive diagnostic tools remain lacking. The \"Atyp.C\" parameter of the Sysmex UF-5000 urine particle analyzer represents the ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm and can be employed to detect urinary atypical cells. The present study examined the association between urinary Atyp.C values and BC risk. This two-center, retrospective case-control study identified clinical primary or newly recurrent BC (study period, 2022-2023; n = 473) cases together with controls with urinary tract infection randomly matched by age and sex (1:1). Urinary sediment differences were compared using non-parametric tests. The correlations between urinary Atyp.C levels and BC grade or infiltration were analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. The BC risk factor odds ratio of Atyp.C was calculated using conditional logistic regression, and potential confounder effects were adjusted using stepwise logistic regression (LR). Primary risk factors were identified by stratified analysis according to pathological histological diagnosis. The mean value of urinary Atyp.C in BC cases (1.30 ± 3.12) was 8.7 times higher than that in the controls (0.15 ± 0.68; P < 0.001). Urinary Atyp.C values were positively correlated with BC pathological grade and invasion (r = 0.360, P < 0.001; r = 0.367, P < 0.001). Urinary Atyp.C was an independent risk factor for BC and closely related with BC pathological grade and invasion. Elevated urinary Atyp.C values was an independent risk factor for BC.

In the clinical validation cohort, our results showed GLIDR was significantly up-regulated in prostate cancer samples and cell lines. To explore the potential functions of the GLIDR, we constructed gene co-expression networks and applied GO analysis. Our analysis revealed that GLIDR was involved in the regulation of translational elongation, transcription, rRNA processing, RNA splicing, signal transduction, and cell adhesion.

We assessed the levels of urinary EV-associated proteins based on 40 samples consisting of 20 cases and 20 controls, where 18 EV proteins were identified to be differentiated in prostate cancer outcome, of which three (i.e., SERPINA3, LRG1, and SCGB3A1) were shown to be consistently upregulated. We also observed 6 out of the 18 (33%) EV proteins that had been developed as drug targets, while some of them showed protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the potential mechanistic pathways of 18 significantly different EV proteins were enriched in metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activities. These results showed consistency in an independent cohort with 20 participants. Using a random forest algorithm for classification assessment, including the identified EV proteins, we found that SERPINA3, LRG1, or SCGB3A1 add predictable value in addition to age, prostate size, body mass index (BMI), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In summary, the current study demonstrates a translational workflow to identify EV proteins as molecular markers to improve the clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer."

The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who experienced a ≥ 50% PSA decline by day 90. Secondary endpoints included changes in testosterone, SHBG, bone turnover markers, and hot flashes, as well as safety.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Four (10.5%) of 38 (95% CI, 2.9, 24.8; P = .120) and 10 (25.6%) of 39 patients (95% CI, 13.0, 42.1; P < .001) in the GTx-758 125 and 250 mg/d cohorts, respectively, experienced ≥ 50% PSA decline. SHBG was increased, providing a mechanism for notable decreases in free testosterone. In the 250 mg/d cohort, 9 men presented with moderate to severe hot flashes, and after 12 weeks, 4 (44%) of 9 reported either mild or no hot flashes (P = .001).

            "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes substantial changes during prostate cancer (PCa) progression, thereby regulating PCa growth and invasion. Herein, a meta-analysis of multiple PCa cohorts is performed which revealed that downregulation or genomic loss of ITGA1 and ITGA2 integrin genes is associated with tumor progression and worse prognosis. Genomic deletion of both ITGA1 and ITGA2 activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in benign prostate epithelial cells, thereby enhancing their invasive potential in vitro and converting them into tumorigenic cells in vivo. Mechanistically, EMT is induced by enhanced secretion and autocrine activation of TGFβ1 and nuclear targeting of YAP1. An unbiased genome-wide co-expression analysis of large PCa cohort datasets identified the transcription factor TEAD1 as a key regulator of ITGA1 and ITGA2 expression in PCa cells while TEAD1 loss phenocopied the dual loss of α1- and α2-integrins in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, clinical data analysis revealed that TEAD1 downregulation or genomic loss is associated with aggressive PCa and together with low ITGA1 and ITGA2 expression synergistically impacted PCa prognosis and progression. This study thus demonstrated that loss of α1- and α2-integrins, either via deletion/inactivation of the ITGA1/ITGA2 locus or via loss of TEAD1, contributes to PCa progression by inducing TGFβ1-driven EMT."

Secondhand smoke causes many health problems, including cancer. Thus, Indonesia will bear large number cancer burden of disease, but research on cancer related to secondhand smoking in Indonesia still does not exist. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the number of secondhand smoke attributable fractions (SAFs) of six cancers (lung, bladder, colorectal, stomach, pancreas and larynx) and burden of cancer caused by secondhand smoking in Indonesia using Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) indicator. Material and Methods: This research was using descriptive epidemiological prevalence-based research design, with cancers prevalence data gained from Indonesian health assurance system database in 2016. The SAFs is calculated by combining both data of secondhand smoking prevalence and relative risk and the DALY indicator is calculated as the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and the equivalent healthy years lost due to disability (YLD). Results: Based on SAFs proportion, the highest SAFs among men were in pancreas cancer (80.20%), stomach cancer (79.54%) and laryngeal cancer (69.61%), whereas in women, pancreas cancer (78.95%), stomach cancer (78.26%) and bladder cancer (63.30%). Meanwhile, burden priorities for Indonesian men and woman were lung cancer (110,491), colorectal (68,131), and bladder cancer (39,140). Conclusions: In total, DALYs 6 cancer diseases due to secondhand smoke analyzed in this study were 283,360 DALYs. Thus, the results of the research can be used as a basis for further policies making on national cigarette prevention and control in Indonesia."

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting β- and α-emitters have been introduced, with promising response rates. Here, we present the first-to our knowledge-clinical data for PSMA-targeted α-therapy (TAT) using 225Ac-PSMA imaging and therapy (I&T). Methods: Fourteen patients receiving 225Ac-PSMA-I&T were included in this retrospective analysis. Eleven of the 14 had prior second-line antiandrogen treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, prior chemotherapy, and prior 177Lu-PSMA treatment. Patients were treated at bimonthly intervals until progression or intolerable side effects. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured for response assessment. Hematologic and nonhematologic side effects were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Results: Thirty-four cycles of 225Ac-PSMA-I&T were applied (median dose, 7.8 MBq; range, 6.0-8.5), with 1 cycle in 3 patients, 2 cycles in 7 patients, 4 cycles in 3 patients, and 5 cycles in 1 patient. No acute toxicity was observed during hospitalization. Baseline PSA was 112 ng/mL (range, 20.5-818 ng/mL). The best PSA response after TAT (a PSA decline ≥ 50%) was observed in 7 patients, and a PSA decline of any amount was observed in 11 patients. Three patients had no PSA decline at any time. A subgroup analysis of 11 patients with prior 177Lu-PSMA treatment showed any PSA decline in 8 patients and a decline of at least 50% in 5 patients. After TAT, grade 3 anemia was observed in 3 of the 14 patients, with 2 of them presenting with grade 2 anemia already at baseline. Grade 3 leukopenia was observed in 1 patient. Eight patients with preexisting xerostomia after 177Lu-PSMA showed no worsening after TAT. Newly diagnosed grade 1 or 2 xerostomia after TAT was observed in 5 patients. One patient reported no xerostomia at all. Conclusion: Our first clinical data for TAT using 225Ac-PSMA-I&T showed a promising antitumor effect in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These results are highly comparable to data on 225Ac-PSMA-617 TAT."

            "abstract": "There is a large body of literature linking anatomic and geometric characteristics of kidney tumors to perioperative and oncologic outcomes. Semantic segmentation of these tumors and their host kidneys is a promising tool for quantitatively characterizing these lesions, but its adoption is limited due to the manual effort required to produce high-quality 3D segmentations of these structures. Recently, methods based on deep learning have shown excellent results in automatic 3D segmentation, but they require large datasets for training, and there remains little consensus on which methods perform best. The 2019 Kidney and Kidney Tumor Segmentation challenge (KiTS19) was a competition held in conjunction with the 2019 International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) which sought to address these issues and stimulate progress on this automatic segmentation problem. A training set of 210 cross sectional CT images with kidney tumors was publicly released with corresponding semantic segmentation masks. 106 teams from five continents used this data to develop automated systems to predict the true segmentation masks on a test set of 90 CT images for which the corresponding ground truth segmentations were kept private. These predictions were scored and ranked according to their average Sørensen-Dice coefficient between the kidney and tumor across all 90 cases. The winning team achieved a Dice of 0.974 for kidney and 0.851 for tumor, approaching the inter-annotator performance on kidney (0.983) but falling short on tumor (0.923). This challenge has now entered an \"open leaderboard\" phase where it serves as a challenging benchmark in 3D semantic segmentation."

            "abstract": "This study investigates the urban-rural and sex differences in the increased risks of the ten most common cancers in China related to high PM2.5 concentration in the southeastern side of Hu line. Pearson correlation coefficient is estimated to reveal how the cancers closely associated with PM2.5 long-term exposure. Then linear regression is conducted to evaluate sex- and area-specific increased risks of those cancers from high level PM2.5 long-term exposure. The major finding is with the increase of every 10 μg/m3 of annual mean PM2.5 concentration, the increase of relative risks for lung cancer incidence and mortality are 15% and 23% for males, and 22% and 24% for females in rural area. For urban area, the increase of relative risk for ovarian cancer incidence is 9% for females, while that for prostatic cancer increases 17% for males. For leukemia, the increase of relative risks for incidence and mortality are 22% and 19% for females in rural area, while in urban area the increase of relative risk for mortality is 9% for males and for incidence is 6% for females. It is also found that with increased PM2.5 exposure, the risks for ovarian and prostatic cancer rise significantly in urban area, while risks for lung cancer and leukemia rise significantly in rural area. The results demonstrate the higher risks for lung cancer and leukemia with increased PM2.5 exposure are more significant for female. This study also suggests that the carcinogenic effects of PM2.5 have obvious sex and urban-rural differences."

The objective of this study was to investigate the survival rates and predictive factors of early response in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) managed by VEGFR-TKIs. From Jan. 2008 to Oct. 2018, 496 patients were treated with VEGFR-TKIs as first-line treatment at the eight Japanese hospitals (Michinoku RCC). Early cessation was defined as VEGFR-TKIs being given up within 3 months after their initiation. The number of patients in early cessation VEGFR-TKIs (Cohort I) was 173 (34.9%), and in long-term use (Cohort II) was 323 (65.1%). The cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were better in Cohort II. IMDC Poor-risk was at risk of early cessation of a first-line VEGFR-TKI. Axitinib was the most preferred drug for long-term treatment. On closer examination, both Cohort I and II were divided into two groups, the patients ceased VEGFR-TKI due to adverse events (Group A [67 from Cohort I] and Group C [51 from Cohort II]) and disease progression (Group B [106 from Cohort I] and Group D [272 from Cohort II]). Despite that the cessation was adverse events, CSS and OS in Group A were worse than both Group C and D. Axitinib was administered with the safer profile. IMDC Poor risk was the risk factor for the early disease progression. Managing early adverse events may contribute to a better prognosis in mRCC patients treated VEGFR-TKIs."

This changing landscape has renewed interest in the concept “disease volume”, the focus of the present study is the Egyptian patients. Methods: Patients with hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer presenting at Menoufia University Hospital, Egypt, during the period from June 2013 to May 2016, were enrolled. All received hormonal treatment. Radiologic images were evaluated and patients were stratified according to their disease volume into high or low, other clinical and pathological data that could affect survival also being collected and analyzed. Results: A total of 128 patients were included, with a median age of 70 years (53.9% ≥70). About 46% had co-morbidities, 62% having high volume disease. During the median follow up period of 28 months about half of the patients progressed and one third received chemotherapy. On univariate analysis, disease volume, performance status (PS), prostate specific antigen level (PSA) and presence of pain at presentation were identified as factors influencing overall survival. Multivariate analysis revealed the independent predictor factors for survival to be PS, PSA and disease volume. The median overall survival with 27 months was high volume versus 49 with low volume disease (hazard ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.2 - 4.4; P=0.02). Median progression free survival was 19 months in the high volume, as compared with 48 months in the low volume disease patients (hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.42 – 7.4; P=0.009). Conclusions: Disease volume is a reliable predictor of survival which should be incorporated with other important factors as; patient performance status and comorbidities in treatment decision-making."

            "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has substantially improved the outcomes of patients with many types of cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Initially studied as monotherapy, immunotherapy-based combination regimens have improved the clinical benefit achieved by ICB monotherapy and have revolutionized RCC treatment. While biomarkers like PD-L1 and tumor mutational burden (TMB) are FDA approved as biomarkers for ICB monotherapy, there are no known biomarkers for combination immunotherapies. Here, we describe the clinical outcomes and genomic determinants of response from a phase Ib/II clinical trial on patients with advanced RCC evaluating the efficacy of lenvatinib, a multi-kinase inhibitor mainly targeting VEGFR and FGFR plus pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 immunotherapy. Concurrent treatment with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab resulted in an objective response rate of 79% (19/24) and tumor shrinkage in 96% (23/24) of patients. While tumor mutational burden (TMB) did not predict for clinical benefit, germline HLA-I diversity strongly impacted treatment efficacy. Specifically, HLA-I evolutionary divergence (HED), which measures the breadth of a patient's immunopeptidome, was associated with both improved clinical benefit and durability of response. Our results identify lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab as a highly active treatment strategy in RCC and reveal HLA-I diversity as a critical determinant of efficacy for this combination. HED also predicted better survival in a separate cohort of patients with RCC following therapy with anti-PD-1-based combination therapy. IMPLICATIONS: These findings have substantial implications for RCC therapy and for understanding immunogenetic mechanisms of efficacy and warrants further investigation."

In vitro assays showed that the co-culture of TAMs promoted the metastatic potential in HTB-1 and T24 by up-regulating EMT markers including Snail, VEGF and Vimentin, as well as oncogenic markers such as β-catenin and NF-κB. More importantly, M2 co-cultured HTB-1 and T24 showed an increased level of metastatic microRNA, miR-30. Silencing of miR-30 resulted in the reduced metastatic potential, migration/invasion, in association with the decreased expression of Twist1 and Vimentin. The addition of BAY11-7082 into the TAM/cancer co-culture system significantly reduced the M2 phenotype and tumorigenic properties.

Histogram- and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based radiomics features were extracted from cancerous volumes of interest (VOIs) on DWI and corresponding ADC maps of each patient acquired from 3.0T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A Mann-Whitney U-test was applied to select features with significant differences between low- and high-grade groups (P < 0.05). Then support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) and classification strategy was adopted to find an optimal feature subset and then to establish a classification model for grading.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total 102 features were derived from each VOI and among them, 47 candidate features were selected, which showed significant intergroup differences (P < 0.05). By the SVM-RFE method, an optimal feature subset including 22 features was further selected from candidate features. The SVM classifier using the optimal feature subset achieved the best performance in bladder cancer grading, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.861, 82.9%, 78.4%, and 87.1%, respectively.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Textural features from DWI and ADC maps can reflect the difference between low- and high-grade bladder cancer, especially those GLCM features from ADC maps.

From the Bladder Cancer Prognosis Programme 575 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) cases, 139 muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) cases and 130 BC-free controls with retrospective data on smoking behaviour and cigarette brand were identified. Independently measured TNCO yields of cigarettes sold in the UK were obtained through the UK Department of Health and merged with the Bladder Cancer Prognosis Programme dataset to estimate the daily intake of TNCO. BC risk increased by TNCO intake category for NMIBC cases (P <0.050 in all multivariate models), but only for the daily intake of tar for MIBC cases (P=0.046) in multivariate models. No difference in risk was observed between smokers of low-tar/low-nicotine and high-tar/high-nicotine cigarettes compared with never smokers, either for NMIBC (P=0.544) or MIBC (P=0.449). High daily intake of TNCO additionally increases the risk of both NMIBC and MIBC compared with low daily intake. However, as there is no difference in BC risk between low-tar/low-nicotine and high-tar/high-nicotine cigarette smokers, it remains unclear whether smoking behaviour or TNCO yield of cigarettes explains this association."

These populations of CD4 and CD8 T cells were significantly upregulated in the patients with RCC of higher WHO/ISUP grade (grades 3, 4) (P < 0.001). Moreover, the cytokine productivities of each population in both CD4 and CD8 T cells of the higher-grade patients were significantly lower than those of the lower-grade patients (P < 0.05).

Whereas [225Ac]Ac-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 alpha therapy showed no difference relative to the blood sample taken before treatment, beta therapy with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 3 h post-injection revealed a small but significant increase in DNA strand breaks. In blood of patients who underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with either [18F]2-fluor-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) or [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, an increase of DNA migration determined by the comet assay was not found when analysed at different time points (2-70 min) after intravenous tracer injection.

DNA damage increased with higher concentrations of all radiolabeled compounds tested. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 caused higher blood cell radiotoxicity than equal activity concentrations of [90Y]Y-DOTA-TOC. Likewise, whole human blood was exposed to the positron emitters [18F]FDG and [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in vitro for 24 h with activity concentrations ranging between 5 and 40 MBq/ml. The same activity concentration dependent elevated DNA migration was observed for both compounds although decay energies are different.

The histopathological examination of post-surgical prostate specimens and manual annotation of PCa not only allow for detailed assessment of disease characteristics and extent, but also supply the ground truth for developing of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for PCa detection before definitive treatment. As manual cancer annotation is tedious and subjective, there have been a number of publications describing methods for automating the procedure via the analysis of digitized whole-slide images (WSIs). However, these studies have focused only on the analysis of WSIs stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), even though there is additional information that could be obtained from immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. In this work, we propose a framework for automating the annotation of PCa that is based on automated colorimetric analysis of both H&E and IHC WSIs stained with a triple-antibody cocktail against high-molecular weight cytokeratin (HMWCK), p63, and α-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR). The analysis outputs were then used to train a regression model to estimate the distribution of cancerous epithelium within slides. The approach yielded an AUC of 0.951, sensitivity of 87.1%, and specificity of 90.7% as compared to slide-level annotations, and generalized well to cancers of all grades."

            "abstract": "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is receiving intense regulatory attention in Taiwan. In previous studies, the effect of air pollution on bladder cancer has been explored. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of atmospheric PM2.5 and other local risk factors on bladder cancer mortality based on available 13-year mortality data. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to estimate and interpret the spatial variability of the relationships between bladder cancer mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentrations, and other variables were covariates used to adjust for the effect of PM2.5. After applying a GWR model, the concentration of ambient PM2.5 showed a positive correlation with bladder cancer mortality in males in northern Taiwan and females in most of the townships in Taiwan. This is the first time PM2.5 has been identified as a risk factor for bladder cancer based on the statistical evidence provided by GWR analysis."

However, one of the least frequent types of systemic malignancies to metastasize to brain or spine is urothelial carcinoma. Thus, few large studies from a single institution exist. Fewer still detail the interval between first diagnosis of primary tumor and CNS lesion, or whether a patient might have their first presentation of cancer in the brain or spine, thus prompting review of our 20-year experience.\n    \n\n\n          Materials:\n        \n      \n      Case identification via text word search of pathology databases from our adult and referral hospitals, 2002 to present.

Given the higher rate of translocation RCC pathology in younger patients, which leads to a higher prevalence of nodal involvement (especially with small masses), and the subsequent need for aggressive surgical control of disease, LN sampling and protocol adherence are potentially underutilized in this population and may present a unique opportunity for urologists to improve the care of PAYAs. Data from administrative databases are helpful for rare diseases such as PAYA RCC, but comes with limitations such as missing data. There are several factors that could contribute to LN sampling utilization (National comprehensive cancer network (NCCN) or Children's Oncology Group institution designation, surgeon experience, annual volume, specialty, operative approach, etc.) that cannot be further examined using the NCDB.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Pediatric, adolescent, and young adult patients with localized RCC are less likely to undergo surgical LN sampling if they are older, have tumors <10 cm or of less advanced stage, have no pre-operative clinical suspicion of LN involvement, are treated with partial nephrectomy, or are treated at lower volume centers. It appears that approaches from adults with RCC are being applied to PAYAs despite evidence that PAYAs with RCC experience a significant rate of LN involvement even with small tumors."

OncoUrine, a urinary assay for mutation and methylation biomarkers, have showed a high accuracy in the detection of upper tract urinary carcinoma (UTUC) patients with hematuria. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of OncoUrine in diagnosis of NMIBC patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this multicenter prospective study, a total of 203 patients were enrolled, including 60 patients present with hematuria and 143 NMIBC patients under recurrence surveillance. Urine samples were collected before cystoscopy to undergo OncoUrine test. OncoUrine performance was calculated compared to clinical standard methods in hematuria cohort and recurrence surveillance cohort, respectively. Furthermore, NMIBC patients were followed up with a median time of 20.5 months (range 0.03 to 24.03 months) to assess the predictive value of OncoUrine during recurrence monitoring.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For bladder cancer diagnosis, OncoUrine tested 47 samples and achieved a sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value (PPV)/negative predictive value (NPV) of 80% (95% CI 44.2-96.5)/91.9% (95% CI 77.0-97.9)/72.7% (95% CI 39.3-92.7)/94.4% (95% CI 80.0-99.0) (kappa value 69.4%, 95% CI 44.4-94.3), indicating 72.3% of unnecessary cystoscopy.

Methods: We synthesised studies using the PRISMA 2020 guideline. We searched databases including Medline, Cochrane Library, CIHANL, CAB Abstracts, Greenlife, African Journal Online, Google Scholar and Web of Science, from inception to April 2021. Heterogeneity across studies and publication bias were assessed. Results: Twenty-five studies were systematically reviewed but only 14 were included in the meta-analysis and categorised based on the outcome studied. Residents of exposed communities have increased risk for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) (OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.44-2.01), lower eGFR (OR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.48-0.67) and higher serum creatinine (OR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.06-1.82) compared to less exposed or unexposed populations.

Patterns of postoperative recovery for the entire cohort and comparisons between RARC and ORC were performed. Exploratory analyses to assess measures of independence across diversion type and to determine whether baseline impairments were associated with 90-day complications or 1-year mortality were performed.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Of the 302 patients included in the analysis (254 men [84.1%]; mean [SD] age at consent, 68.0 [9.7] years), 150 underwent RARC and 152 underwent ORC. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. For the entire cohort, ADL, iADL, and TUGWT recovered to baseline by 3 postoperative months, whereas HGS recovered by 6 months. There was no difference between RARC and ORC for ADL, iADL, TUGWT, or HGS scores at any time. Activities of daily living recovered 1 month after RARC (mean estimated score, 7.7 [95% CI, 7.3-8.0]) vs 3 months after ORC (mean estimated score, 7.5 [95% CI, 7.2-7.8]). Hand grip strength recovered by 3 months after RARC (mean estimated HGS, 29.0 [95% CI, 26.3-31.7] kg) vs 6 months after ORC (mean estimated HGS, 31.2 [95% CI, 28.8-34.2] kg).

            "abstract": "Antiangiogenic therapy is efficacious in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). However, the ability of antiangiogenic drugs to delay tumor progression and extend survival is limited, due to either innate or acquired drug resistance. Furthermore, there are currently no validated biomarkers that predict which mRCC patients will benefit from antiangiogenic therapy. Here, we exploit susceptibility contrast MRI (SC-MRI) using intravascular ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles to quantify and evaluate tumor fractional blood volume (fBV) as a noninvasive imaging biomarker of response to the antiangiogenic drug sunitinib. We also interrogate the vascular phenotype of RCC xenografts exhibiting acquired resistance to sunitinib. SC-MRI of 786-0 xenografts prior to and 2 weeks after daily treatment with 40 mg/kg sunitinib revealed a 71% (P < 0.01) reduction in fBV in the absence of any change in tumor volume. This response was associated with significantly lower microvessel density (P < 0.01) and lower uptake of the perfusion marker Hoechst 33342 (P < 0.05). The average pretreatment tumor fBV was negatively correlated (R2 = 0.92, P < 0.0001) with sunitinib-induced changes in tumor fBV across the cohort. SC-MRI also revealed suppressed fBV in tumors that acquired resistance to sunitinib. In conclusion, SC-MRI enabled monitoring of the antiangiogenic response of 786-0 RCC xenografts to sunitinib, which revealed that pretreatment tumor fBV was found to be a predictive biomarker of subsequent reduction in tumor blood volume in response to sunitinib, and acquired resistance to sunitinib was not associated with a parallel increase in tumor blood volume.

Log-rank tests and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used for analyses. Patients with mutations in either TP53 or SMARCA4 tumor suppressor genes had shorter TAS (7.5 vs 14.2 mo; log-rank p = 0.004). While these patients exhibited features of aggressive disease clinically, the two-gene model was independently predictive in multivariable analyses (hazard ratio 3.30, 95% confidence interval 1.07-10.18; p = 0.038).

If validated, this two-gene model could help in stratifying patients with mRCC and identifying those who are poor candidates for AS. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this study, we analyzed tumors from patients with metastatic kidney cancer enrolled in a clinical trial of imaging surveillance. We found that tumors with mutations in either the TP53 or SMARCA4 gene progressed faster than tumors without these mutations. Thus, patients harboring mutations in these genes may not be good candidates for AS."

The dissemination of cancer cells during resection and the consequent seeding into the bladder mucosa is the main cause of post-TURBT intravesical recurrence. Although the tumor dissemination is inevitable during conventional TURBT (cTURBT), this drawback can be overcome by tumor resection in one piece with intact surrounding normal tissues, referred to as en bloc resection. We previously described the photodynamic diagnosis (PDD)-assisted en bloc TURBT (EBTUR) technique and its favorable outcomes.

A total of 160 eligible patients will be enrolled after screening and randomly allocated to the PDD-EBTUR (experimental) and PDD-cTURBT (control) groups in a 1:1 ratio (80 cases to 80 cases). All patients will be treated using a single, immediate postoperative intravesical chemotherapy with epirubicin. The primary endpoint of this trial is the 2-year recurrence-free survival after surgery in pathologically proven low- or intermediate-risk NMIBC. All patients will be monitored by cystoscopy and urine cytology every 3 months for 2 years.

Case-specific gene mutations were selected from sequencing analysis to examine ctDNA by dPCR analysis. We also prospectively collected plasma and urine ctDNA from each patient. The longitudinal variant allele frequencies of ctDNA during the perioperative period were plotted. Case-specific gene mutations were detected in 22 cases (96%) from ctDNA in the preoperative samples. Frequently detected genes were TERT (39%), FGFR3 (26%), TP53 (22%), and HRAS (13%). In all cases, we obtained plasma and urine samples for 241 time points and undertook individualized ctDNA monitoring for 2 years after RNU. Ten patients with intravesical recurrence had case-specific ctDNA detected in urine at the time of recurrence. The mean lead time of urinary ctDNA in intravesical recurrence was 60 days (range, 0-202 days). Two patients with distal metastasis had case-specific ctDNA in plasma at the time of metastasis. In UTUC, tumor-specific gene mutations can be monitored postoperatively as ctDNA in plasma and urine. Individualized ctDNA might be a minimally invasive biomarker for the early detection of postoperative recurrence."

First, we aimed to assess the impact of forced diuresis with early furosemide injection on the detection rate of local recurrence in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence referred for 68Ga-labeled Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC (68Ga-PSMA-11) PET/CT. Second, we determined whether intravenous administration of furosemide shortly after tracer injection increases renal washout of 68Ga-PSMA-11 before it binds to the PSMA receptor with possible influence on biodistribution and intensity of tracer uptake in organs with physiologic tracer accumulation. Methods: In a retrospective analysis, 2 different groups with 220 prostate cancer patients each, referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT because of biochemical recurrence after primary therapy, were compared: patients in group 1 (median prostate-specific antigen, 1.30 ng/mL) received no preparation before imaging, whereas patients in group 2 (median prostate-specific antigen, 0.82 ng/mL) were injected with 20 mg of furosemide and 500 mL of sodium chloride (NaCl 0.9%) immediately after tracer injection. The presence of local recurrence was assessed visually. In addition, the intensity of tracer accumulation in organs with physiologic tracer uptake was evaluated. Results: The detection rate of lesions judged positive for local recurrence was significantly higher in patients receiving furosemide than in patients without preparation: 56 cases (25.5%) versus 38 cases (17.3%), respectively (P = 0.048). Median maximum SUVs (SUVmax) of organs with physiologic uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in groups 1 and 2 were urinary bladder (63.0 vs. 8.9), kidney (55.6 vs. 54.5), liver (9.9 vs. 9.4), spleen (11.2 vs. 11.9), small bowel (16.2 vs. 17.1), parotid gland (19.2 vs. 19.6), lacrimal gland (8.9 vs. 10.9), blood-pool activity (2.2 vs. 2.3), muscle (1.0 vs. 1.1), and bone (1.6 vs. 1.6). Apart from bladder activity, no significant reduction of tracer accumulation was found in the patient group receiving furosemide. Conclusion: Injection of 20 mg of furosemide at the time point of radiotracer administration significantly increases the detection rate of local recurrence in prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. As intensity of 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in organs with physiologic uptake is not significantly reduced, a negative impact of early furosemide injection on targeting properties and biodistribution of 68Ga-PSMA-11 seems unlikely."

Despite numerous attempts for disease prevention, prostate tumours can still become metastatic by blood circulation to other organs. Several treatments have been adopted. However, findings show that the docetaxel treatment induces adverse reactions in patients. Particle Swarm Optimized Gaussian Process Classifier (PSO-GPC) is proposed to determine when to discontinue treatment. Based on three cohorts of prostate cancer patients, we propose and compare several classifiers for the best performance in determining treatment discontinuation. Given the data skewness and class imbalance, the models are evaluated based on both the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and area under precision recall curve (AUPRC). With the AUCs ranging between 0.6717-0.8499, and AUPRCs ranging between 0.1392-0.5423, PSO-GPC performs better than the state-of-the-art. We have carried out statistical analysis for ranking methods and analyzed independent cohort data with PSO-GPC, demonstrating its unbiased performance.

Herein, we report the case of a patient with metastatic UBC harboring a rare M1043I mutation of PIK3CA which was detected using DNA-based next-generation sequencing. The patient received everolimus as first-line therapy after palliative transurethral resection. The treatment resulted in complete response within 1 month, and the patient achieved a progression-free survival (PFS) of >6 months according to reports from the last follow-up visit. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of PIK3CA-mutant UBC for which everolimus therapy demonstrated a significant benefit suggesting that the rare M1043I mutation variant may be a potential biomarker of sensitivity to everolimus. Further insights into its mechanism and clinical studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of everolimus therapy in patients with PIK3CA M1043I mutation."

            "abstract": "TFEB is overexpressed in TFEB-rearranged renal cell carcinomas as well as in renal tumors with amplifications of TFEB at 6p21.1. As recent literature suggests that renal tumors with 6p21.1 amplification behave more aggressively than those with rearrangements of TFEB, we compared relative TFEB gene expression in these tumors. This study included 37 TFEB-altered tumors: 15 6p21.1-amplified and 22 TFEB-rearranged (including 5 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas data set). TFEB status was verified using a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization (n=27) or comprehensive molecular profiling (n=13) and digital droplet polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify TFEB mRNA expression in 6p21.1-amplified (n=9) and TFEB-rearranged renal tumors (n=19). These results were correlated with TFEB immunohistochemistry. TFEB-altered tumors had higher TFEB expression when normalized to B2M (mean: 168.9%, n=28), compared with non-TFEB-altered controls (mean: 7%, n=18, P=0.005). Interestingly, TFEB expression in tumors with rearrangements (mean: 224.7%, n=19) was higher compared with 6p21.1-amplified tumors (mean: 51.2%, n=9; P=0.06). Of note, classic biphasic morphology was only seen in TFEB-rearranged tumors and when present correlated with 6.8-fold higher TFEB expression (P=0.00004). Our results suggest that 6p21.1 amplified renal tumors show increased TFEB gene expression but not as much as t(6;11) renal tumors. These findings correlate with the less consistent/diffuse expression of downstream markers of TFEB activation (cathepsin K, melan A, HMB45) seen in the amplified neoplasms. This suggests that the aggressive biological behavior of 6p21.1 amplified renal tumors might be secondary to other genes at the 6p21.1 locus that are co-amplified, such as VEGFA and CCND3, or other genetic alterations."

Whilst representative of the prostate cancer survivor population, the age-distribution of the sample differs from the general population, thus data were generalised to the NI population by excluding those aged 40-59 years and applying survey weights.

We applied a variant difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, adjusting for seasonal temperature and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the exposure for specific cancer sites were estimated. Attributable fractions and cancer deaths were also calculated. In total, 1,332,526 adult cancer deaths (age ≥ 20 years), from 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, covering 136 million adults were included. The mean annual wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 2.38 μg/m3, and the annual non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 8.20 μg/m3. The RR for mortality from all cancers was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001) per 1-μg/m3 increase of wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration, which was higher than the RR per 1-μg/m3 increase of non-wildfire-related PM2.5 (1.01 [95% CI 1.00-1.01], p = 0.007, with p for difference = 0.003).

The average PM2.5 concentration was 7.63 μg/m3 (standard deviation 3.32) with range from 2.95 μg/m3 to 28.5 μg/m3. With each 10 μg/m3 increase in three-year-average (current year and previous two years) concentrations of PM2.5, the relative risks (RR) of cancer mortality were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.20) for all-site cancers. The PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with several cancer-specific mortalities including oral, nasopharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, colon rectum, liver, gallbladder, larynx, lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix, prostate, brain and leukaemia. No safe level of PM2.5 exposure was observed in the exposure-response curve for all types of cancer. In conclusion, with nationwide cancer death records in Brazil, we found that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increased risks of mortality for many cancer types.

The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (RECIST v1.1) in the intent-to-treat and HRD-positive (loss of genome-wide heterozygosity ≥10%) populations. Key secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and safety.

Independent verification calculations using Monte Carlo methods for Vero4DRT have been published. As the Clarkson method is faster and easier to use than measurement and Monte Carlo methods, we evaluated the accuracy of an independent calculation verification program and its feasibility as a secondary check for Vero4DRT. Computed tomography (CT)-based dose calculation was performed using a modified Clarkson-based algorithm. In this study, 120 patients' treatment plans were collected in our institute. The treatments were performed using conventional irradiation for lung and prostate, 3-dimensional (3D) conformal stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the lung, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for the prostate. Differences between the treatment planning system (TPS) and the Clarkson-based independent dose verification software were computed, and confidence limits (CLs, mean ± 2 standard deviation %) for Vero4DRT were compared with the CLs for the C-arms linear accelerators in the previous study. The results of the CLs, the conventional irradiation, SBRT, and IMRT showed 2.2 ± 3.5% (CL of the C-arms linear accelerators: 2.4 ± 5.3%), 1.1 ± 1.7% (-0.3 ± 2.0%), 4.8 ± 3.7% (5.4 ± 5.3%), and -0.5 ± 2.5% (-0.1 ± 3.6%) differences, respectively.

Men with low-risk, localised prostate cancer (Gleason pattern 3) who had received no previous treatment were randomly assigned (1:1) to vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy (4 mg/kg padeliporfin intravenously over 10 min and optical fibres inserted into the prostate to cover the desired treatment zone and subsequent activation by laser light 753 nm with a fixed power of 150 mW/cm for 22 min 15 s) or active surveillance. Randomisation was done by a web-based allocation system stratified by centre with balanced blocks of two or four patients. Best practice for active surveillance at the time of study design was followed (ie, biopsy at 12-month intervals and prostate-specific antigen measurement and digital rectal examination at 3-month intervals). The co-primary endpoints were treatment failure (histological progression of cancer from low to moderate or high risk or death during 24 months' follow-up) and absence of definite cancer (absence of any histology result definitely positive for cancer at month 24). Analysis was by intention to treat. Treatment was open-label, but investigators assessing primary efficacy outcomes were masked to treatment allocation.

Vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy was well tolerated. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were prostatitis (three [2%] in the vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy group vs one [<1%] in the active surveillance group), acute urinary retention (three [2%] vs one [<1%]) and erectile dysfunction (two [1%] vs three [1%]).

We provide a long-term update after 10 years of follow-up of the primary endpoint (progression-free survival) and report on the late toxicities of treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The trial was designed as a 2 × 2 factorial study with hormonal sequencing as one stratification factor and radiation field as the other factor and tested whether NHT improved progression-free survival versus AHT, and NHT plus WPRT versus NHT plus PORT. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed, clinically localised adenocarcinoma of the prostate, an estimated risk of lymph node involvement of more than 15% and a Karnofsky performance status of more than 70, with no age limitations. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) by permuted block randomisation to receive either NHT 2 months before and during WPRT followed by a prostate boost to 70 Gy (NHT plus WPRT group), NHT 2 months before and during PORT to 70 Gy (NHT plus PORT group), WPRT followed by 4 months of AHT (WPRT plus AHT group), or PORT followed by 4 months of AHT (PORT plus AHT group). Hormonal therapy was combined androgen suppression, consisting of goserelin acetate 3·6 mg once a month subcutaneously or leuprolide acetate 7·5 mg once a month intramuscularly, and flutamide 250 mg twice a day orally for 4 months. Randomisation was stratified by T stage, Gleason Score, and prostate-specific antigen concentration. NHT was given 2 months before radiotherapy and was continued until radiotherapy completion; AHT was given at the completion of radiotherapy for 4 months. The primary endpoint progression-free survival was analysed by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00769548.

With a median follow-up of 8·8 years (IQR 5·07-13·84) for all patients and 14·8 years (7·18-17·4) for living patients (n=346), progression-free survival across all timepoints continued to differ significantly across the four treatment groups (p=0·002). The 10-year estimates of progression-free survival were 28·4% (95% CI 23·3-33·6) in the NHT plus WPRT group, 23·5% (18·7-28·3) in the NHT plus PORT group, 19·4% (14·9-24·0) in the WPRT plus AHT group, and 30·2% (25·0-35·4) in the PORT plus AHT group. Bladder toxicity was the most common grade 3 or worse late toxicity, affecting 18 (6%) of 316 patients in the NHT plus WPRT group, 17 (5%) of 313 in the NHT plus PORT group, 22 (7%) of 317 in the WPRT plus AHT group, and 14 (4%) of 315 in the PORT plus AHT group. Late grade 3 or worse gastrointestinal adverse events occurred in 22 (7%) of 316 patients in the NHT plus WPRT group, five (2%) of 313 in the NHT plus PORT group, ten (3%) of 317 in the WPRT plus AHT group, and seven (2%) of 315 in the PORT plus AHT group.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      In this cohort of patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk localised prostate cancer, NHT plus WPRT improved progression-free survival compared with NHT plus PORT and WPRT plus AHT at long-term follow-up albeit increased risk of grade 3 or worse intestinal toxicity.

Although PD-L1 expression in renal cancer has been reported as a predictor of treatment response and prognosis, its assessment by immunohistochemistry is invasive and difficult to perform repeatedly. Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) has recently been proposed as a predictive biomarker for several tumour types. Therefore, we evaluated sPD-L1 levels in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab and investigated its association with treatment response.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We performed a prospective single-arm study in patients with mRCC treated with nivolumab as second line or later therapy.

The International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk score was significantly poorer in the high sPD-L1 group. The objective response rate was significantly higher (41.2% vs. 7.7%) and overall survival significantly longer (p=0.0323) in the low group compared to the high group.

            "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effects of CO2 pneumoperitoneum on venous hemodynamics and cardiopulmonary function during transperitoneal or retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery. Materials and Methods: A single-institution prospective study. Forty-three patients with renal-cell carcinoma undergoing retroperitoneal (22) or transperitoneal (21) laparoscopic partial nephrectomy were enrolled. Hemodynamic functions were monitored by minimally invasive FloTrac/Vigileo system. Transesophageal echocardiography was used to measure the diameter and blood flow of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Measured parameters were recorded at baseline, 10, 30, 60 minutes following insufflation to 14 mm Hg and 10 minutes following desufflation. Results: For hemodynamic changes in the transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery (TPL) and retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery (RPL), transperitoneal CO2 insufflation resulted in a rapid parallel increase in central intravenous pressure (CVP), peak airway pressure (AWP), and IVC blood flow velocity after the first 30 minutes of pneumoperitoneum (p < 0.05). In contrast, CVP, AWP, and IVC blood flow velocity increased progressively in RPL. The variation of those parameters was significantly lower than that of TRL (p < 0.001; p = 0.002; p = 0.004). The mean maximum CVP in the two groups was 20 and 16 mm Hg, respectively. The IVC diameter at the cavoatrial junction was significantly reduced in TPL after 10 minutes of insufflation, but it remained unchanged in RPL throughout the surgery. For cardiopulmonary function changes, heart output decreased after a short period of pneumoperitoneum, but no statistical differences were observed between the two groups. The increments of partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide and end-tidal carbon dioxide tension were significantly higher in RPL than TPL (p < 0.001; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Compared with retroperitoneal pneumoperitoneum, transperitoneal pneumoperitoneum has significant effects on IVC hemodynamics. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) causes higher AWP and venous return resistance, which lead to the significant increase of CVP during transperitoneal approach. Adjusting the balance between IAP and CVP might be an effective way to control intravenous bleeding. Clinical Trial Registry: Registration number: ChiCTR2000038291."

Patient- and disease-related covariates along with NTCP model predictions were independently tested for significant association with physician-graded toxicity or a decline in bowel-related QoL.

            "abstract": "During the 9/11 attacks individuals were exposed to World Trade Center (WTC) dust which contained a complex mixture of carcinogens. Epidemiological studies have revealed the increased incidence of prostate and thyroid cancer in WTC survivors and responders. While reports have shown that WTC-dust associates with the increased prevalence of inflammatory related disorders, studies to date have not determined whether this exposure impacts cancer progression. In this study, we have used genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models with prostate specific deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor to study the impact of WTC-dust exposure on deposition of dust particles, inflammation, and cancer progression. In normal C57/BL6 mice, dust exposure increased cellular expression of inflammatory genes with highest levels in the lung and peripheral blood. In normal and tumor bearing GEM mice, increased immune cell infiltration to the lungs was observed. Pathological evaluation of mice at different time points showed that WTC-dust exposure promoted PI3K-AKT activation, increased epithelial proliferation and acinar invasion in prostates with heterozygous and homozygous Pten loss. Using autochthonous and transplant GEM models of prostate cancer we demonstrated that dust exposure caused reduced survival as compared to control cohorts. Finally, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to detect elevated immune cell infiltration and cellular expression of inflammatory markers in prostate tumors isolated from human WTC survivors. Collectively, our study shows that chronic inflammation, induced by WTC dust exposure, promotes more aggressive cancer in genetically predisposed prostates and potentially in patients."

            "abstract": "The recommended treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) is tumor resection followed by adjuvant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) bladder instillations. However, only 50% of patients benefit from this therapy. If progression to advanced disease occurs, then patients must undergo a radical cystectomy with risks of substantial morbidity and poor clinical outcome. Identifying tumors unlikely to respond to BCG can translate into alternative treatments, such as early radical cystectomy, targeted therapies, or immunotherapies. Here, we conducted molecular profiling of 132 patients with BCG-naive HR-NMIBC and 44 patients with recurrences after BCG (34 matched), which uncovered three distinct BCG response subtypes (BRS1, 2 and BRS3). Patients with BRS3 tumors had a reduced recurrence-free and progression-free survival compared with BRS1/2. BRS3 tumors expressed high epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and basal markers and had an immunosuppressive profile, which was confirmed with spatial proteomics. Tumors that recurred after BCG were enriched for BRS3. BRS stratification was validated in a second cohort of 151 BCG-naive patients with HR-NMIBC, and the molecular subtypes outperformed guideline-recommended risk stratification based on clinicopathological variables. For clinical application, we confirmed that a commercially approved assay was able to predict BRS3 tumors with an area under the curve of 0.87. These BCG response subtypes will allow for improved identification of patients with HR-NMIBC at the highest risk of progression and have the potential to be used to select more appropriate treatments for patients unlikely to respond to BCG."

Additionally, within a prostate-cancer-specific cohort, MDT is able to forestall initiation of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in men with hormone-sensitive, oligometastatic prostate cancer (HSOPCa) compared to observation. While MDT appears to be safe and effective in HSOPCa, a large percentage of men will eventually have disease recurrence. Patterns of failure in HSOPCa demonstrate patients tend to have recurrence in the bone following MDT, raising the question of sub-clinically-apparent osseous disease. Radium-223 dichloride is a radiopharmaceutical with structural similarity to calcium, allowing it to be taken up by bone where it emits alpha particles, and therefore might have utility in the treatment of micrometastatic osseous disease.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The management of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains a major challenge in clinical practice, and the construction of more reliable prognostic prediction models and the further elucidation of key molecular mechanisms of tumor progression are topics in urgent need of in-depth investigation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used CIBERSORT to estimate the proportion of 22 tumor-infiltrating immune cell types in the TCGA-KIRC cohort. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis were used to build risk prediction models. Expression patterns and clinical significance of TRAF2 were determined through bioinformatics analysis, real-time qPCR, Western Blot, immunohistochemistry. GSEA analysis, transmission electron microscopy, 2D/3D colony formation assay, cell migration and invasion assay, and tube-formation assay were used to investigate the underlying function and mechanism of the TRAF2/M2 macrophage/autophagy axis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We constructed a novel prognostic prediction model based on M2 macrophage-related genes, which was identified as an accurate, independent and specific prognostic risk model for ccRCC patients. A reliable nomogram was constructed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival for patients with ccRCC. As one of the constituent genes of the risk model, TRAF2 was determined to be upregulated in ccRCC and associated with poor clinical prognosis. We found that TRAF2 promotes malignant progression of ccRCC by regulating macrophage polarization, migration and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, we found that TRAF2 promotes the polarization of M2 macrophages, and this chemotaxis is achieved in an autophagy-dependent pathway. Orthotopic tumor growth assay results revealed that TRAF2 plays a key role as a promotor of ccRCC growth and metastasis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In conclusion, this risk model is highly predictive of prognostic in ccRCC patients, which is expected to promote improved treatment evaluation and comprehensive management of ccRCC. Moreover, our findings reveal that the TRAF2/M2 macrophage/autophagy axis plays a key regulatory role in the malignant progression of ccRCC, and suggest that TRAF2 is a potential novel therapeutic target for advanced ccRCC."

            "abstract": "Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) data are normalised using endogenous control genes. We aimed to: (1) demonstrate a pathway to identify endogenous control genes for qPCR analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue using bladder cancer as an exemplar; and (2) examine the influence of probe length and sample age on PCR amplification and co-expression of candidate genes on apparent expression stability. RNA was extracted from prospective and retrospective samples and subject to qPCR using TaqMan human endogenous control arrays or single tube assays. Gene stability ranking was assessed using coefficient of variation (CoV), GeNorm and NormFinder. Co-expressed genes were identified from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using the on-line gene regression analysis tool GRACE. Cycle threshold (Ct) values were lower for prospective (19.49 ± 2.53) vs retrospective (23.8 ± 3.32) tissues (p < 0.001) and shorter vs longer probes. Co-expressed genes ranked as the most stable genes in the TCGA cohort by GeNorm when analysed together but ranked lower when analysed individually omitting co-expressed genes indicating bias. Stability values were < 1.5 for the 20 candidate genes in the prospective cohort. As they consistently ranked in the top ten by CoV, GeNorm and Normfinder, UBC, RPLP0, HMBS, GUSB, and TBP are the most suitable endogenous control genes for bladder cancer qPCR."

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to identify factors associated with early discharge (by postoperative day 4).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 84 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 28.1 months (range 1.8-193.1). Thirty-four (40.5%) patients had a nasogastric tube postoperatively. The patients were advanced to a clear liquid diet on a median postoperative day 2 (range 0-7) and regular diet on a median postoperative day 3 (range 1-8). Median time from surgery to discharge was 5 days (range 2-12), with 38 (45.2%) discharged early. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that earlier resumption of regular diet (OR 0.523, P = 0.028) was positively associated with early discharge. Other analyzed factors were not significant (see Table).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Timely initiation of adjuvant therapy is a specific requirement of Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are ideally initiated simultaneously, as early as possible, within 2 weeks of surgery. Thus, factors that can facilitate early discharge from the hospital can maximize protocol adherence with respect to timing of adjuvant therapy initiation and optimize patient outcome. This study shed light on several postoperative factors and how these relate to postoperative stay and recovery. Specifically, tumor size, pre-operative bowel preparation, extent of lymph node sampling, stage, operative time, estimated blood loss, surgical service, postoperative nasogastric tube use, transfusion, and chemotherapy prior to discharge were not associated with discharge timing. Early re-feeding was associated with early discharge. Thus, it seems reasonable that, when developing a postoperative care pathway for these patients, these factors be considered and specifically encourage early re-feeding. In pediatrics, data on early recovery after surgery protocols are limited, and high-quality studies are unavailable. Within pediatric urology, early recovery after surgery protocols in children undergoing major urologic reconstruction have been shown to reduce hospital stay and can decrease complication rates. It seems reasonable that a similar pathway can be applied to children undergoing radical nephrectomy for suspected malignancy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For children with renal tumors who underwent radical nephrectomy, early re-feeding was associated with a shorter time to discharge. Use of bowel preparation and nasogastric tube did not appear to shorten time to discharge. These data are important for developing postoperative care pathways for these patients."

We subsequently analyzed the safety and usefulness of the procedure. The Test clamp procedure was performed for 1 to 3 min during renal artery test ischemia prior to the actual ischemia and tumor resection. We confirmed the disappearance of blood flow around the renal tumor using color Doppler ultrasonography. If arterial blood flow around the tumor remained, we surveyed the site for other arteries that needed to be clamped and repeated the test clamp procedure until renal blood flow around the tumor disappeared. We retrospectively analyzed consecutive RAPN cases performed from July 2016 to March 2020 at our institutions and reviewed medical records. The clinical data of the RAPN cases were statistically analyzed. Sixty-four RAPN cases underwent the test clamp procedure, which was categorized as the TEST group. Test clamping was performed safely without any clamping-related complications in all cases. Eleven cases (17%) underwent partial ischemia, which was a significantly higher number than that in the control group. Massive bleeding during tumor resection was more frequent in the control group. Postoperative deterioration of estimated glomerular filtration rate did not differ significantly between both groups. Although further investigation was still necessary, our findings indicate that the test clamp procedure may be a safe and secure procedure to perform in RAPN for both patients and surgeons."

With an additional follow-up of 23 months from the primary analysis, we report results from the lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus sunitinib comparison of CLEAR. Treatment-naïve patients with aRCC were randomly assigned to receive lenvatinib (20 mg orally once daily in 21-day cycles) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg intravenously once every 3 weeks) or sunitinib (50 mg orally once daily [4 weeks on/2 weeks off]). At this data cutoff date (July 31, 2022), the OS hazard ratio (HR) was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99). The median OS (95% CI) was 53.7 months (95% CI, 48.7 to not estimable [NE]) with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus 54.3 months (95% CI, 40.9 to NE) with sunitinib; 36-month OS rates (95% CI) were 66.4% (95% CI, 61.1 to 71.2) and 60.2% (95% CI, 54.6 to 65.2), respectively.

Median tumor size was 26 mm (± 20-33); 9% were stage T1b. Mean follow-up time was 36.3±12.0 months. In total, 14 (11%) procedures led to complications, of which 4 (3%) were intraoperative, 5 (4%) appeared ≤30 days and 5 (4%) >30 days after treatment. Major complications arose after 4 (3%) procedures. Statistically significant associations were found between major complications and stage T1b (P = 0.039), RENAL score (P = 0.010), and number of needles used in cryoablation (P = 0.004). Residual tumor was detected after 4 (3%) procedures and 5 (4%) tumors had local tumor progression. Of 122 patients, 3 (2%) advanced to metastatic disease. Significant statistical associations were found between local tumor progression and T1b stage tumors and number of needles used in cryoablation (P = 0.05 and P = 0.004, respectively). For patients with T1a tumors, the one- and three-year disease-free survival was 98% and 95%, respectively, and for T1b 100% after one year and 75% after three years.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study showed that cryoablation is a safe and effective treatment of stage T1 RCC and suggests that in selecting candidates for cryoablation of RCC, the tumor characteristics are more critical than patients' baseline health status."

            "abstract": "The relationship between heavy metal exposure and human health has been investigated mostly for individual metals, failing to consider their potential interactions. In this study, we assessed the joint effects of multiple metals using generalized weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression on the risk of urothelial carcinoma (UC). Also, we performed mediation analysis to evaluate the mediator %5-MedC in DNA involved in the mechanism of urothelial carcinogenesis. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 355 UC patients and 710 controls, where diagnosis of UC was histologically confirmed. All data were collected from face-to-face interviews and medical records. Also, we measured six metals and 8-OHdG in urine samples along with %5-MedC in peripheral blood. Ni and Pb levels increased with UC risk in single-pollutant analysis using traditional logistic regression, and similar results were obtained in multi-pollutant analysis, where all metals analyzed were considered. In WQS analysis, the weights of Ni (27%), Pb (20%), Cr (18%), and Co (16%) predominated in the metal mixture index. WQS score and UC risk showed odds ratios of 1.65 (95%CI: 1.26, 2.15) and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.00, 2.05) for a linear and non-linear relationship, respectively. Finally, we did not observe a natural indirect effect of %5-MedC in DNA; however, a marginal effect of WQS score and natural direct effect were still found after considering a natural indirect effect. In conclusion, positive associations between WQS scores and increased risk of UC were observed. Interactions of multiple metals should be considered in assessing human health risk."

            "abstract": "Background and Objective: Radium-223 dichloride (Xofigo®) is a calcium mimetic agent approved for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastatic disease. This targeted, α-particle-emitting therapy has demonstrated significant survival benefit accompanied by a favorable safety profile. Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that its combined use with abiraterone and prednisone/prednisolone may be associated with increased risk of death and fractures. While the precise pathophysiologic mechanisms of these events are not yet clear, collecting evidence from more clinical trials and translational studies is necessary. The aim of our present study is to assess whether accessible sources of patient outcome data can help gain additional clinical insights to radium-223 dichloride's safety profile. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of cases extracted from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System and characterized side effect occurrence by using reporting ratios. Results: A total of ~1500 prostate cancer patients treated with radium-223 dichloride was identified, and side effects reported with the use of radium-223 dichloride alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents were extracted. Our analysis demonstrates that radium-223 dichloride may often come with hematological-related reactions, and that, when administered together with other drugs, its safety profile may differ. Conclusions: While more prospective studies are needed to fully characterize the toxicological profile of radium-223 dichloride, the present work constitutes perhaps the first effort to examine its safety when administered alone and in combination with other agents based on computational evidence from public real-world post marketing data."

            "abstract": "Treatment paradigms for patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) are typically extrapolated from studies of bladder cancer despite their distinct clinical and molecular characteristics. The advancement of UTUC research is hampered by the lack of disease-specific models. Here, we report the establishment of patient derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line models that reflect the genomic and biological heterogeneity of the human disease. Models demonstrate high genomic concordance with the corresponding patient tumors, with invasive tumors more likely to successfully engraft. Treatment of PDX models with chemotherapy recapitulates responses observed in patients. Analysis of a HER2 S310F-mutant PDX suggests that an antibody drug conjugate targeting HER2 would have superior efficacy versus selective HER2 kinase inhibitors. In sum, the biological and phenotypic concordance between patient and PDXs suggest that these models could facilitate studies of intrinsic and acquired resistance and the development of personalized medicine strategies for UTUC patients."

            "abstract": "Humans are variously and continuously exposed to a wide range of different DNA-damaging agents, some of which are classed as carcinogens. DNA damage can arise from exposure to exogenous agents, but damage from endogenous processes is probably far more prevalent. That said, epidemiological studies of migrant populations from regions of low cancer risk to high cancer risk countries point to a role for environmental and/or lifestyle factors playing a pivotal part in cancer aetiology. One might reasonably surmise from this that carcinogens found in our environment or diet are culpable. Exposure to carcinogens is associated with various forms of DNA damage such as single-stand breaks, double-strand breaks, covalently bound chemical DNA adducts, oxidative-induced lesions and DNA-DNA or DNA-protein cross-links. This review predominantly concentrates on DNA damage induced by the following carcinogens: polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic aromatic amines, mycotoxins, ultraviolet light, ionising radiation, aristolochic acid, nitrosamines and particulate matter. Additionally, we allude to some of the cancer types where there is molecular epidemiological evidence that these agents are aetiological risk factors. The complex role that carcinogens play in the pathophysiology of cancer development remains obscure, but DNA damage remains pivotal to this process."

For time-to-event data, available methods only focus on detecting and testing treatment-by-covariate interactions and may not consider multiplicity. In this work, we introduce the Bayesian credible subgroups approach for time-to-event endpoints. It provides two bounding subgroups for the true benefiting subgroup: one which is likely to be contained by the benefiting subgroup and one which is likely to contain the benefiting subgroup. A personalized treatment effect is estimated by two common measures of survival time: the hazard ratio and restricted mean survival time. We apply the method to identify benefiting subgroups in a case study of prostate carcinoma patients and a simulated large clinical dataset."

            "abstract": "A recent phase 3 trial of intravesical nadofaragene firadenovec reported a promising complete response rate for patients with bacillus Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This study examined the ability of antiadenovirus antibody levels to predict the durability of therapeutic response to nadofaragene firadenovec. A standardized and validated quantitative assay was used to prospectively assess baseline and post-treatment serum antibody levels among 91 patients from the phase 3 trial, of whom 47 (52%) were high-grade recurrence free at 12 mo (responders). While baseline titers did not predict treatment response, 3-mo titer >800 was associated with a higher likelihood of durable response (p = 0.026). Peak post-treatment titers >800 were noted in 42 (89%) responders versus 26 (59%) nonresponders (p = 0.001; assay sensitivity, 89%; negative predictive value, 78%). Moreover, 22 (47%) responders compared with eight (18%) nonresponders had a combination of peak post-treatment titers >800 and peak antibody fold change >8 (p = 0.004; assay specificity, 82%; positive predictive value, 73%). A majority of responders continued to have post-treatment antibody titers >800 after the first 6 mo of therapy. In conclusion, serum antiadenovirus antibody quantification may serve as a novel predictive marker for nadofaragene firadenovec response durability. Future studies will focus on large-scale validation and clinical utility of the assay. PATIENT SUMMARY: This study reports on a planned secondary analysis of a phase 3 multicenter clinical trial that established the benefit of nadofaragene firadenovec, a novel intravesical gene therapeutic, for the treatment of patients with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Prospective assessment of serum anti-human adenovirus type-5 antibody levels of patients in this trial indicated that a combination of post-treatment titers and fold change from baseline can predict treatment efficacy. While this merits additional validation, our findings suggest that serum antiadenovirus antibody levels can serve as an important predictive marker for the durability of therapeutic response to nadofaragene firadenovec."

            "abstract": "In prostate cancer (PCa), and many other hormone-dependent cancers, there is clear evidence for distorted transcriptional control as disease driver mechanisms. Defining which transcription factor (TF) and coregulators are altered and combine to become oncogenic drivers remains a challenge, in part because of the multitude of TFs and coregulators and the diverse genomic space on which they function. The current study was undertaken to identify which TFs and coregulators are commonly altered in PCa. We generated unique lists of TFs (n = 2662), coactivators (COA; n = 766); corepressors (COR; n = 599); mixed function coregulators (MIXED; n = 511), and to address the challenge of defining how these genes are altered we tested how expression, copy number alterations and mutation status varied across seven prostate cancer (PCa) cohorts (three of localized and four advanced disease). Testing of significant changes was undertaken by bootstrapping approaches and the most significant changes were identified. For one commonly and significantly altered gene were stably knocked-down expression and undertook cell biology experiments and RNA-Seq to identify differentially altered gene networks and their association with PCa progression risks. COAS, CORS, MIXED and TFs all displayed significant down-regulated expression (q.value < 0.1) and correlated with protein expression (r 0.4-0.55). In localized PCa, stringent expression filtering identified commonly altered TFs and coregulator genes, including well-established (e.g. ERG) and underexplored (e.g. PPARGC1A, encodes PGC1α). Reduced PPARGC1A expression significantly associated with worse disease-free survival in two cohorts of localized PCa. Stable PGC1α knockdown in LNCaP cells increased growth rates and invasiveness and RNA-Seq revealed a profound basal impact on gene expression (~ 2300 genes; FDR < 0.05, logFC > 1.5), but only modestly impacted PPARγ responses. GSEA analyses of the PGC1α transcriptome revealed that it significantly altered the AR-dependent transcriptome, and was enriched for epigenetic modifiers. PGC1α-dependent genes were overlapped with PGC1α-ChIP-Seq genes and significantly associated in TCGA with higher grade tumors and worse disease-free survival. These methods and data demonstrate an approach to identify cancer-driver coregulators in cancer, and that PGC1α expression is clinically significant yet underexplored coregulator in aggressive early stage PCa."

            "title": "The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.",
            "abstract": "Dear Editors,We read with interest the article by Di Franco and co-workers (1). The introduction of prostatic magnetic resonance and the relative fusion-biopsy have not yet allowed the expected improvements in prostate biopsy. To our knowledge, there are no works that demonstrate the superiority of fusion techniques on the remaining ultrasound guided prostate biopsies that are still the widely used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Furthemore, these technologies are expensive exams and they are not yet available in all centers, especially in those minors. We work at a \"minor\" center and we always keep in mind that the goal of prostatic biopsy is the diagnosis and the staging of prostatic neoplasms.. However, it remains uncertain which of the two techniques, transperineal (TP) or transrectal (TR), is superior in terms of detection rate during first biopsy setting. Several studies have compared the prostate cancer detection rate but TR and TP access route in prostatic gland sampling seems to be equivalent in terms of efficiency and complications, as reported by Shen PF et al. (2), despite several methodological limitations recognized in their work. The results reported by Di Franco CA et al. represent the real life experience of most urologists that perform the PB based on their own training experience and available technical devices. From an historical viewpoint, the TP route has been the first one to be used to reach the prostate, both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To date, because it seems to be more invasive and difficult, the TP route is less used worldwide than the TR one (2). Theoretically, the TP approach should detect more prostate cancer than the TR way because the cores of the TP approach are directed longitudinally to the peripheral zone and the anterior part of the prostate (4). The results reported by Di Franco et al. seems to confirm these considerations. However, our real life experience differ from the conclusions reached in their work. We recently conducted a prospective evaluation of 352 patients who underwent their first prostate biopsy because of a suspicious of prostate cancer (elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination and/or abnormal findings on transrectal prostatic ultrasound). Patients was randomized as following. A total of 187 patients (Group A) underwent a prostatic biopsy with a transperineal approach in a lithotomic position, using a biplane probe (8818 BK Medical, Denmark) and a fan technique with a single perineal median access (5). The remnants 165 patients (Group B) underwent a transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy in a left lateral position, using a end fire probe configuration (8818 BK Medical, Denmark) and a sagittal technique. The bioptic prostatic mapping was performed with a 12-core scheme sec. Gore (3) by a single experienced operator and the histopathologic evaluation was performed by a single dedicated uro-pathologist. Statistical evaluations were made with a T Student test (p&lt;0,005). Group A and Group B was similar in term of mean patient age (67,9 years and 67 years respectively), mean total PSA (12,1 ng/ml vs 12 ng/ml) and digital rectal examination positivity (22% vs 29%). The global cancer detection rate was 33,69% (63/187) in the transperineal prostate biopsy group and 48,48 % (80/165) in the transrectal approach (p=0.0047). No significant statistical differences were found in the complications rates between the two groups. Statistical evaluation of site of tumor localization reveal only a trend to statistical significance in apical site tumors diagnosed with the TR approach versus the TP technique. The TR approach had a better diagnostic accuracy than TP technique in case of PSA&lt;4 ng/ml, intermediate prostate volume (30 and 50 ml), normal digital rectal examination without any relationship with the patient age. In our experience, two aspect may explain the difference between the two group in term of global detection rate. First, we usually perform transrectal biopsy with a sagittal technique that simulates the transperineal way of needle incidence with the prostatic gland. The lateral and anterior gland portions may be sampled more accurately. Second, our transperineal approach consists in a single perineal median access that can make more difficult the gland sampling between the two lobes. However, there was no significant difference in core positivity rate at the peripheral zone, medium gland, apex or any other site such as reported in many randomized clinical trials (2). Unlike the conclusions reported by Di Franco et al., in our experience we found a statistically significant difference between the TR and TP approach, at the first biopsy setting, in term of global cancer detection rate. No differences were found in terms of complications. Moreover, our data suggest that TR approach had a better diagnostic accuracy than TP technique in case of PSA&lt;4 ng/ml, prostate volume 30-50 ml, normal digital rectal examination without any relationship with the patient age. The further step of the statistical evaluation of our data will be the definition of the possibility that the TR biopsy determine a better staging of prostate cancer than TP approach as first procedure.

An increased risk of higher-grade (Gleason sum ≥4 + 3) prostate cancer for high vs low quartile of total cholesterol level was observed in the HPFS (ORmultivariable = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.01-2.40). This finding was compatible with the association noted in the meta-analysis of highest vs lowest group of total cholesterol level, which suggested a moderately increased risk of higher-grade prostate cancer (Pooled RR =1.21; 95%CI: 1.11-1.32). Moreover, the dose-response meta-analysis indicated that an increased risk of higher-grade prostate cancer occurred primarily at total cholesterol levels ≥200 mg/dl, where the RR was 1.04 (95%CI: 1.01-1.08) per 20 mg/dl increase in total cholesterol level. However, total cholesterol concentration was not associated with the risk of prostate cancer overall either in the HPFS or in the meta-analysis.

And whether nonisotropic PTV margins are beneficial for these structures. Organ motion is linked to the displacement of the prostate and SVs. From the use of MRgRT, the nearby organs at risk (OAR) can be visualized both inter- and intrafraction. This study looked to determine if there is a correlation between interfractional OAR changes and displacements to the prostate and SVs. Inter- and intrafractional data from 20 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated using extreme hypofractionated 0.35 T MRgRT indicated prostate and SV motion during treatment. Tracking points (TPs) on 2D sagittal cine-MRI enabled assessment of this intrafractional motion. To determine a correlation between rectal changes and target displacements, the rectal diameter (RD) changes were compared against the displacement differences (DDs) at the prostate and SVs. Eighty percent of patients required intrafractional imaging corrections during radiotherapy, including 16/100 fractions due to rectal volume increases and 24/100 fractions due to bladder volume increases. The frequency of ≥3 mm intrafraction displacement was considerably greater in TPs in the SV than in the prostate. A moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.417) was shown between RD changes and DDs at the level of the prostate and SVs. The PTV margins required for 90% of the patient cohort for prostate and SVs are nonuniform in different directions, and the margin is larger for SVs. Organ motion contributed toward prostate and SV displacements and showed the importance of a robust bladder and rectal-filling protocol."

Here, efficacy and safety were assessed from the initial analysis of the JAVELIN Bladder 100 trial (data cutoff October 21, 2019) in patients enrolled in Asian countries.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC that had not progressed with 4 to 6 cycles of first-line platinum-containing chemotherapy (gemcitabine + cisplatin or carboplatin) were randomized 1:1 to receive avelumab first-line maintenance + BSC or BSC alone, stratified by best response to first-line chemotherapy and visceral vs. nonvisceral disease when initiating first-line chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was OS assessed from randomization in all patients and patients with PD-L1+ tumors (Ventana SP263 assay).

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) susceptibility is defined by a continuum from rare, high-penetrance to common, low-penetrance alleles. Research to date has concentrated on identification of variants at the ends of that continuum. Taking an alternate approach, we focused on the important but elusive class of low-frequency, moderately penetrant variants by performing disease model-based variant filtering of whole exome sequence data from 75 hereditary PCa families. Analysis of 341 candidate risk variants identified nine variants significantly associated with increased PCa risk in a population-based, case-control study of 2,495 men. In an independent nested case-control study of 7,121 men, there was risk association evidence for TANGO2 p.Ser17Ter and the established HOXB13 p.Gly84Glu variant. Meta-analysis combining the case-control studies identified two additional variants suggestively associated with risk, OR5H14 p.Met59Val and CHAD p.Ala342Asp. The TANGO2 and HOXB13 variants co-occurred in cases more often than expected by chance and never in controls. Finally, TANGO2 p.Ser17Ter was associated with aggressive disease in both case-control studies separately. Our analyses identified three new PCa susceptibility alleles in the TANGO2, OR5H14 and CHAD genes that not only segregate in multiple high-risk families but are also of importance in altering disease risk for men from the general population. This is the first successful study to utilize sequencing in high-risk families for the express purpose of identifying low-frequency, moderately penetrant PCa risk mutations."

            "abstract": "Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) is a pioneer transcription factor that is essential for the normal development of several endoderm-derived organs, including the prostate gland1,2. FOXA1 is frequently mutated in hormone-receptor-driven prostate, breast, bladder and salivary-gland tumours3-8. However, it is unclear how FOXA1 alterations affect the development of cancer, and FOXA1 has previously been ascribed both tumour-suppressive9-11 and oncogenic12-14 roles. Here we assemble an aggregate cohort of 1,546 prostate cancers and show that FOXA1 alterations fall into three structural classes that diverge in clinical incidence and genetic co-alteration profiles, with a collective prevalence of 35%. Class-1 activating mutations originate in early prostate cancer without alterations in ETS or SPOP, selectively recur within the wing-2 region of the DNA-binding forkhead domain, enable enhanced chromatin mobility and binding frequency, and strongly transactivate a luminal androgen-receptor program of prostate oncogenesis. By contrast, class-2 activating mutations are acquired in metastatic prostate cancers, truncate the C-terminal domain of FOXA1, enable dominant chromatin binding by increasing DNA affinity and-through TLE3 inactivation-promote metastasis driven by the WNT pathway. Finally, class-3 genomic rearrangements are enriched in metastatic prostate cancers, consist of duplications and translocations within the FOXA1 locus, and structurally reposition a conserved regulatory element-herein denoted FOXA1 mastermind (FOXMIND)-to drive overexpression of FOXA1 or other oncogenes. Our study reaffirms the central role of FOXA1 in mediating oncogenesis driven by the androgen receptor, and provides mechanistic insights into how the classes of FOXA1 alteration promote the initiation and/or metastatic progression of prostate cancer. These results have direct implications for understanding the pathobiology of other hormone-receptor-driven cancers and rationalize the co-targeting of FOXA1 activity in therapeutic strategies."

Furthermore, the signature successfully predicted immunotherapeutic sensitivity in three cohorts (all P < 0.05). Knockdown of CSH1 in B cells increased Breg phenotype and enhanced suppressive ability against CD8 + T cells (all P < 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bregs play a pro-tumor role in the development of BLCA. The Breg-related gene signature established in this study holds great potential as a valuable tool for evaluating prognosis and predicting immunotherapeutic response in BLCA patients."

            "abstract": "Background/aim:\n        \n      \n      Lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab combination therapy is a safe and effective treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, there are no reports of the use of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination therapy for RCC with an inferior vena cava (IVC) tumor thrombus. Herein, we describe a case in which pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy was effectively used to treat RCC with the IVC tumor thrombus extending to the right atrium.\n    \n\n\n          Case report:\n        \n      \n      A 73-year-old man was diagnosed with a right renal tumor with the IVC tumor thrombus extending to the right atrium and multiple pulmonary metastases (cT3cN0M1). Using a computed tomography-guided renal tumor biopsy, the tumor was diagnosed as clear cell RCC. The International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk classification was poor according to three risk factors, and lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination therapy was initiated. The primary renal tumor shrunk, the IVC tumor thrombus that reached the right atrium was reduced from level 4 to level 2, and the lung metastases disappeared 4 months after treatment initiation. Thereafter, a robot-assisted deferred cytoreductive nephrectomy was successfully performed. Pathologically, owing to the preoperative combination therapy, most of the tumor tissue was necrotic; however, some viable cells were present in the primary tumor and IVC tumor thrombus. Eight months following the operation, the patient remains recurrence-free.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Treatment with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab combination therapy led to tumor shrinkage and allowed robot-assisted nephrectomy in a patient with advanced RCC with the IVC tumor thrombus extending to the right atrium, corroborating the efficacy of the treatment."

The drugs have different mechanisms of action with limited comparative trials to evaluate treatment in patients with comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes. This is important since abiraterone requires the co-administration of prednisone. We assessed the relationship between body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), treatment, and survival in mCRPC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Veterans treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide within the Veterans Health Administration between September 10, 2014 and June 2, 2017 with BMI and HbA1c were identified. Additional variables included age, baseline prostate-specific antigen at first treatment for mCRPC, race, and the Charlson comorbidity index. Differences in survival were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression modeling was used to assess the association between initial treatment, BMI, and HbA1c while adjusting for confounding variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 5231 patients were identified with a mean age of 75.2 years and 1241 (23.7%) were of black race. BMI was associated with OS with longest median survival of 29.8 months in BMI ≥ 30 (n = 1903), 23.9 months in BMI 25-30 (n = 1879), 15.9 months in BMI 18.5-25 (n = 1336), and 9.2 months in BMI < 18.5 (n = 113, p < 0.001). In a multivariable model compared to normal BMI, increased mortality was observed in BMI < 18.5 (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.583, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29-1.94) and a decreased mortality in BMI 25-30 (aHR = 0.751, 95% CI: 0.69-0.81) and BMI > 30 (aHR = 0.644, 95% CI: 0.59-0.70). In 3761 patients with BMI > 25, there was longer OS in patients treated with enzalutamide (28.4 months, n = 1615) compared to abiraterone (25.8 months, n = 2146, p = 0.002). In 1470 patients with BMI < 25, there was no difference in OS between patients treated with enzalutamide (16.0 months, n = 597, p = 0.513) or abiraterone (16.1 months, n = 873). In 1333 veterans with HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, initial prescription of enzalutamide was associated with longer OS compared with abiraterone (24.4 vs. 20.5 months, p = 0.0005). In 2088 patients with HbA1c < 6.5%, there was no difference in OS in patients who were initially prescribed enzalutamide versus abiraterone (25.7 vs. 23.5 months, p = 0.334).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In veterans with mCRPC, increased BMI was associated with longer survival. Veterans with BMI > 25 had longer survival with enzalutamide compared to abiraterone. In patients with HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, enzalutamide was associated with longer survival compared to abiraterone. These results may facilitate prognostication of survival and improve treatment selection based on patient comorbidities."

The extensive use of multiple biomarkers plays an important role in the diagnosis and prognosis of PC. However, the accuracy of biomarkers for PC prognosis needs to be urgently improved. This study aimed to identify a novel prognostic biomarker for PC.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Differentially methylated CpG sites were identified from the GSE76938 dataset ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ ) using R software version 3.1.4. Four significant CpG sites on the SLCO4C1 gene were found to be closely associated with prognosis in PC. Data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used for validation. Co-expression and functional enrichment analyses were used to explore the roles of SLCO4C1 in molecular functions, biological processes and cellular components. Total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were used to reveal the difference in SLCO4C1 expression between tumour and normal tissues. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BSAS) was used to identify methylation levels at the CpG sites.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the GSE76938 cohort, 10,206 CpG sites were identified to be differentially methylated in tumour versus normal prostate tissues. Among the CpG sites, four sites (cg06480736, cg19774478, cg19788741 and cg22149516) located in the promotor region (TSS200-1500) of SLCO4C1 were found to be significantly hypermethylated in tumour tissues. The results were validated in an independent dataset (TCGA PRAD cohort). In the cohort from TCGA, SLCO4C1 expression was negatively correlated with methylation levels at the four sites. The results of qRT-PCR validated that tumour tissues had a relatively lower expression of SLCO4C1. Bisulfite amplicon sequencing (BSAS) further confirmed a higher methylation level at the SLCO4C1 promoter in tumour tissues. SLCO4C1 (cg06480736, cg19774478, cg19788741 and cg22149516) was identified as a significant promising biomarker for biochemical recurrence-free survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P < 0.01) and univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis: cg06480736 (HR 15.914, P < 0.001), cg19774478 (HR 9.001, P < 0.001), cg19788741 (HR 10.759, P = 0.003) and cg22149516 (HR 17.144, P = 0.006).

Urine metabolomics is a powerful approach to discover potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. In this study, we applied an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) method to profile the metabolites in urine from 29 bladder cancer patients and 15 healthy controls. The differential metabolites were extracted and analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis methods. Together, 19 metabolites were discovered as differently expressed biomarkers in the two groups, which mainly related to the pathways of phenylacetate metabolism, propanoate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, glycine and serine metabolism, and bile acid biosynthesis. In addition, a subset of 11 metabolites of those 19 ones were further filtered as potential biomarkers for BC diagnosis by using logistic regression model. The results revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) value, sensitivity and specificity of receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve were 0.983, 95.3% and 100%, respectively, indicating an excellent discrimination power for BC patients from healthy controls. It was the first time to reveal the potential diagnostic markers of BC by metabolomics, and this will provide a new sight for exploring the biomarkers of the other disease in the future work."

We sought to identify the exposure sources of 10 metals (Vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, and lead) using principal component analysis (PCA) and then linked various principal component (PC) scores with environmental characteristics, including smoking-related indices, PM2.5, and distance to the nearest bus station. In addition, urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and DNA hypomethylation markers (5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine levels; %5-MedC) were investigated in combination with UC risks. We conducted this hospital-based case control study in 359 UC patients with histologically confirmed disease and 718 controls. All data were collected from face-to-face interviews and medical records. Approximately 6 mL blood was collected from participants for analysis of multiple heavy metal and DNA methylation in leukocyte DNA. Further, a 20 mL urine sample was collected to measure urinary cotinine and 8-OHdG levels. In addition, average values for PM2.5 for individual resident were calculated using the hybrid kriging/land-use regression model. In UC patients, significantly higher cobalt, nickel, copper, arsenic, and cadmium (μg/L) levels were observed in blood when compared with controls. Three PCs with eigenvalues > 1 accounted for 24.3, 15.8, and 10.7% of UC patients, and 26.9, 16.7, and 11.1% of controls, respectively. Environmental metal sources in major clusters were potentially associated with industrial activities and traffic emissions (PC1), smoking (PC2), and food consumption, including vitamin supplements (PC3). Multiple metal doses were linked with incremental urinary 8-OHdG and DNA hypomethylation biomarkers. For individuals with high PC1 and PC2 scores, both displayed an approximate 1.2-fold risk for UC with DNA hypomethylation.In conclusion, we provide a foundation for health education and risk communication strategies to limit metal exposure in environment, so that UC risks can be improved potentially."

Emerging evidence suggests immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are particularly effective for these tumors, although the biological basis for this property is largely unknown. Here, we evaluate multiple clinical trial and real-world cohorts of S/R RCC to characterize their molecular features, clinical outcomes, and immunologic characteristics. We find that S/R RCC tumors harbor distinctive molecular features that may account for their aggressive behavior, including BAP1 mutations, CDKN2A deletions, and increased expression of MYC transcriptional programs. We show that these tumors are highly responsive to ICI and that they exhibit an immune-inflamed phenotype characterized by immune activation, increased cytotoxic immune infiltration, upregulation of antigen presentation machinery genes, and PD-L1 expression. Our findings build on prior work and shed light on the molecular drivers of aggressivity and responsiveness to ICI of S/R RCC."

Accurate assessment of tumor aggressiveness guides recruitment to AS programs to avoid conservative treatment of intermediate and higher risk patients. Nevertheless, underestimating the disease risk may occur in some patients recruited, with biopsy upgrading and the concomitant potential for delayed treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Aim:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the accuracy of mpMRI and GPS for the prediction of biopsy upgrading during active surveillance (AS) management of prostate cancer (PCa).\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      A retrospective analysis was performed on 144 patients recruited to AS from October 2013 to December 2020. Median follow was 4.8 (IQR 3.6, 6.3) years. Upgrading was defined as upgrading to biopsy grade group ≥2 on follow up biopsies. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to investigate the effect of PSA density (PSAD), baseline Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1 score and GPS on upgrading. Time-to-event outcome, defined as upgrading, was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank test.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Overall rate of upgrading was 31.9% (n = 46). PSAD was higher in the patients who were upgraded (0.12 vs. 0.08 ng/ml2 , p = .005), while no significant difference was present for median GPS in the overall cohort (overall median GPS 21; 22 upgrading vs. 20 no upgrading, p = .2044). On univariable cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the factors associated with increased risk of biopsy upgrading were PSA (HR = 1.30, CI 1.16-1.47, p = <.0001), PSAD (HR = 1.08, CI 1.05-1.12, p = <.0001) and higher PI-RADS score (HR = 3.51, CI 1.56-7.91, p = .0024).

Clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common pathological type, accounting for approximately 80% of RCC. The lack of accurate and effective prognosis prediction methods has been a weak link in ccRCC treatment. Co-stimulatory molecules played the main role in increasing anti-tumor immune response, which determined the prognosis of patients. Therefore, the main objective of the present study was to explore the prognostic value of co-stimulatory molecules genes in ccRCC patients.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The TCGA database was used to get gene expression and clinical characteristics of patients with ccRCC. A total of 60 co-stimulatory molecule genes were also obtained from TCGAccRCC, including 13 genes of the B7/ CD28 co-stimulatory molecules family and 47 genes of the TNF family. In the TCGA cohort, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was used to generate a multigene signature. R and Perl programming languages were used for data processing and drawing. Real-time PCR was used to verify the expression of differentially expressed genes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study's initial dataset included 539 ccRCC samples and 72 normal samples.

LASSO Cox regression analysis results indicated that 13 risk genes were optimally used to construct a prognostic model of ccRCC. The patients were divided into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Those in the high-risk group had significantly lower OS (Overall Survival rate) than patients in the low-risk group. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed the predictive value of the prognosis model of ccRCC (AUC>0.7). There are substantial differences in immune cell infiltration between high and low-risk groups. Functional analysis revealed that immune-related pathways were enriched, and immune status was different between the two risk groups. Real-time PCR results for genes were consistent with TCGA DEGs.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      By stratifying patients with all independent risk factors, the prognostic score model developed in this study may improve the accuracy of prognosis prediction for patients with ccRCC."

            "abstract": "OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to prospectively compare image quality and diagnostic accuracy of clinically significant prostate cancer with and without endorectal coil (ERC) at 3 T using a combination of T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MRI. SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Twenty-three patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer underwent MRI with and without ERC at the same visit. Patients subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. Specimens were assessed by whole-mount histopathologic examination. Two radiologists reviewed MR images for image quality (5-point scale) and disease using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data Systems version 2 (PI-RADSv2). Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated with and without ERC. Additionally, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was correlated with Gleason score and ADC values of each lesion were compared with and without ERC. RESULTS. Image quality was comparable with and without ERC (3.8 vs 3.5). Twenty-nine cancer foci larger than 0.5 cm in diameter were found in 23 patients on histopathologic examination; 18 tumors had a Gleason score of 7 or greater. Two radiologists recorded AUC for tumors with a Gleason score of 7 or greater as 0.96 and 0.96 with ERC and 0.88 and 0.91 without ERC. All 13 tumors with a Gleason score of 3 + 4 were detected with ERC, but only 9 were detected without ERC. One of five tumors with Gleason scores less than 3 + 4 was missed with and without ERC. ADC significantly correlated with Gleason score. There was no significant difference in the ADC of a lesion on MRI with and without an ERC. CONCLUSION. MRI with and without ERC was equally accurate at showing prostate cancers with Gleason scores of 4 + 3 or greater. However, MRI with ERC was superior at showing cancer with a Gleason score of 3 + 4. There was no significant difference in ADC values between scores acquired with or without an ERC."

Here we produced and analysed whole-genome, whole-transcriptome and DNA methylation data for 208 pairs of tumour tissue samples and matched healthy control tissue from Chinese patients with primary prostate cancer. Systematic comparison with published data from 2,554 prostate tumours revealed that the genomic alteration signatures in Chinese patients were markedly distinct from those of Western cohorts: specifically, 41% of tumours contained mutations in FOXA1 and 18% each had deletions in ZNF292 and CHD1. Alterations of the genome and epigenome were correlated and were predictive of disease phenotype and progression. Coding and noncoding mutations, as well as epimutations, converged on pathways that are important for prostate cancer, providing insights into this devastating disease.

            "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain a variety of biomolecules and provide information about the cells that produce them. EVs from cancer cells found in urine can be used as biomarkers to detect cancer, enabling early diagnosis and treatment. The potential of alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) and clusterin (CLU) as novel diagnostic urinary EV (uEV) biomarkers for bladder cancer (BC) was demonstrated previously. To validate the diagnostic value of these proteins in uEVs in a large BC cohort, urine handling conditions before uEV isolation should be optimized during sample transportation from medical centers. In this study, we analyzed the uEV protein quantity, EV particle number, and uEV-A2M/CLU after urine storage at 20°C and 4°C for 0-6 days, each. A2M and CLU levels in uEVs were relatively stable when stored at 4°C for a maximum of three days and at 20°C for up to 24 h, with minimal impact on analysis results. Interestingly, pre-processing to remove debris and cells by centrifugation and filtration of urine did not show any beneficial effects on the preservation of protein biomarkers of uEVs during storage. Here, the importance of optimizing shipping conditions to minimize the impact of pre-analytical handling on the uEVs protein biomarkers was emphasized. These findings provide insights for the development of clinical protocols that use uEVs for diagnostic purposes."

            "abstract": "PET using radiolabeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is now being more widely adopted as a valuable tool to evaluate patients with prostate cancer (PC). Recently, 3 different criteria for interpretation of PSMA PET were published: the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) criteria, the Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation criteria, and the PSMA Reporting and Data System. We compared these 3 criteria in terms of interreader, intrareader, and intercriteria agreement. Methods: Data from 104 patients prospectively enrolled in research protocols at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort consisted of 2 groups: 47 patients (mean age, 64.2 y old) who underwent Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[68Ga(HBED-CC)] (68Ga-PSMA11) PET/MRI for initial staging of biopsy-proven intermediate- or high-risk PC, and 57 patients (mean age, 70.5 y old) who underwent 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT because of biochemically recurrent PC. Three nuclear medicine physicians independently evaluated all 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI and PET/CT studies according to the 3 interpretation criteria. Two of them reevaluated all studies 6 mo later in the same manner and masked to the initial reading. The Gwet agreement coefficient was calculated to evaluate interreader, intrareader, and intercriteria agreement based on the following sites: local lesion (primary tumor or prostate bed after radical prostatectomy), lymph node metastases, and other metastases. Results: In the PET/MRI group, interreader, intrareader, and intercriteria agreement ranged from substantial to almost perfect for any site according to all 3 criteria. In the PET/CT group, interreader agreement ranged from substantial to almost perfect except for judgment of distant metastases based on the PSMA Reporting and Data System (Gwet agreement coefficient, 0.57; moderate agreement), in which the most frequent cause of disagreement was lung nodules. Intrareader agreement ranged from substantial to almost perfect for any site according to all 3 criteria. Intercriteria agreement for each site was also substantial to almost perfect. Conclusion: Although the 3 published criteria have good interreader and intrareader reproducibility in evaluating 68Ga-PSMA11 PET, there are some factors causing interreader disagreement. Further work is needed to address this issue."

However, a few cases (20%) with low metastatic potential showed relatively low DNA methylation levels, indicating the heterogeneity of methylation pattern in FH-deficient RCC. Moreover, FH-deficient RCC is potentially highly immunogenic, characterized by increased tumor T-cell infiltration but high expression of immune checkpoint molecules in tumors. Clinical data further demonstrated that patients receiving immune checkpoint blockade-based treatment achieved improved progression-free survival over those treated with antiangiogenic monotherapy (median, 13.3 vs. 5.1 months; P = 0.03).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These results reveal the genomic features and provide new insight into potential therapeutic strategies for FH-deficient RCC."

            "abstract": "The expression of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its correlation with the prognosis and clinicopathologic features of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remain controversial to date. Concerning this issue, we had conducted a meta-analysis of relevant studies searched in the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale was applied to assess the quality of the included studies. The hazard ratio (HR) and its corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were collected by Stata 12.0 and used for the results of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). A total of 1,644 patients in 8 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Results showed that PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with OS (HR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.22-3.22, Z = 2.77, p = 0.006) and DFS (HR = 3.70, 95% CI: 2.07-6.62, Z = 4.40, p = 0.0001) in ccRCC. Subgroup analysis indicated that PD-L1 expression significantly correlated with the lymph-gland transfer ratio (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.02-5.92, Z = 1.99, p = 0.05) and tumor necrosis (HR = 6.05, 95% CI: 3.78-9.67, Z = 7.51, p < 0.00001). This meta-analysis suggests that PD-L1 expression is a valuable prognostic tool for patients with ccRCC. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that it was helpful for screening patients with RCC who need anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and support them to benefit from such immune-targeted therapy."

Treatment options include topical chemotherapy, immunotherapy, laser treatment, photodynamic therapy and surgical excision. Our primary aim was to evaluate the outcome of carbon dioxide (CO2) laser treatment of penile intraepithelial neoplasia.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A retrospective review of 47 patients who underwent CO2 laser ablation of PeIN, from May 2008 to June 2015, in our tertiary referral centre was performed. All patients underwent acetic acid mapping and had their lesions ablated with a Lumenis Shaplan CO2 laser device.

Seven of the eight patients with recurrences, pathologically had further PeIN and one patient developed G1 pT1 disease. These patients underwent further laser treatment, glans resurfacing or local excision. No patients required penectomy. The average length of follow-up was 29 months (rg: 1-76). Penile cancer-specific survival was 100% and overall survival 98%.

Lasso regression analysis was used to analyze further the mutual genes between the BPH module and the CRPC module. As a result, DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L were significantly correlated with the transcriptomic features in both BPH and CRPC.

Accumulating evidence suggested that ccRCC was considered a metabolic disease and metabolism-associated genes (MAGs) exerted essential functions in tumor metastases. Thus, this study intends to seek whether the dysregulated metabolism promotes ccRCC metastases and explores underlying mechanisms.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed based on 2131 MAGs to select genes mostly associated with ccRCC metastases for subsequent univariate Cox regression.

The prognostic signature was confirmed using E-MTAB-1980 and GSE22541 cohorts. Kaplan-Meier, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression were applied to detect the predictability and independence of the signature in ccRCC patients. Functional enrichment analyses, immune cell infiltration examinations, and somatic variant investigations were employed to detect the biological roles of the signature.\n    \n\n\n          Result:\n        \n      \n      A 12-gene-metabolism-associated prognostic signature, termed the MAPS by our team, was constructed. According to the MAPS, patients were divided into low- and high-risk subgroups and high-risk patients displayed inferior outcomes. The MAPS was validated as an independent and reliable biomarker in ccRCC patients for forecasting the prognosis and progression of ccRCC patients. Functionally, the MAPS was closely associated with metabolism dysregulation, tumor metastases, and immune responses in which the high-risk tumors were in an immunosuppressive status. Besides, high-risk patients benefited more from immunotherapy and held a higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) than low-risk patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The 12-gene MAPS with prominent biological roles could independently and reliably forecast the outcomes of ccRCC patients, and provide clues to uncover the latent mechanism in which dysregulated metabolism controlled ccRCC metastases."

            "abstract": "Mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations are rare in prostate cancer, and their histological and clinical characteristics are largely unknown. We conducted a retrospective study to explore disease characteristics and treatment outcomes of men with metastatic prostate cancer harboring germline and/or somatic MMR mutations detected using clinical-grade genomic assays. Thirteen patients with a deleterious MMR gene mutation were identified. Median age was 64 yr, 75% had grade group 5 (Gleason sum 9 or 10), 23% had intraductal histology, 46% had metastatic disease at initial diagnosis, and 31% had visceral metastases. Most patients (46%) had MSH6 mutations, 73% demonstrated microsatellite instability, and median tumor mutational load was 18/Mb (range, 3-165 mutations/Mb). Surprisingly, responses to standard hormonal therapies were very durable (median progression-free survival [PFS] of 67 mo to initial androgen deprivation and median PFS of 26 mo to abiraterone/enzalutamide). Two of four men receiving PD-1 inhibitors achieved a ≥50% prostate-specific antigen response at 12 wk, with a median PFS duration in these four men of 9 mo. Despite aggressive clinical and pathological features, patients with MMR-mutated advanced prostate cancer appear to have particular sensitivity to hormonal therapies, as well as anecdotal responses to PD-1 inhibitors. Certain histological features (grade group 5, intraductal carcinoma) should prompt evaluation for MMR deficiency. These data are only hypothesis generating. PATIENT SUMMARY: Prostate cancers with mismatch repair gene mutations have aggressive clinical and pathological features; however, these are very sensitive to standard and novel hormonal therapies, and also demonstrate anecdotal sensitivity to PD-1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab."

Here we report that metabolomic profiling of longitudinal plasmas from a prospective cohort of 491 active surveillance (AS) participants indicates prominent elevations in plasma sphingolipids in AS progressors that, together with plasma Cav-1, yield a prognostic signature for disease progression. Mechanistic studies of the underlying tumor supportive onco-metabolism reveal coordinated activities through which Cav-1 enables rewiring of cancer cell lipid metabolism towards a program of 1) exogenous sphingolipid scavenging independent of cholesterol, 2) increased cancer cell catabolism of sphingomyelins to ceramide derivatives and 3) altered ceramide metabolism that results in increased glycosphingolipid synthesis and efflux of Cav-1-sphingolipid particles containing mitochondrial proteins and lipids. We also demonstrate, using a prostate cancer syngeneic RM-9 mouse model and established cell lines, that this Cav-1-sphingolipid program evidences a metabolic vulnerability that is targetable to induce lethal mitophagy as an anti-tumor therapy."

Medical records of patients with documented metastatic UC treated by pembrolizumab as second-line therapy were reviewed from60 institutions in 20 countries. Patients were assessed for Overall Response Rate (ORR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS), and Overall Survival (OS). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to explore the association of variables of interest with OS and PFS. 881 patients were included; of them, 263 (30%) presented BM. Median follow-up time was 22.7 months. Patients with BM showed both shorter median OS (5.9 months vs 13.1 months, p < 0.001) and PFS (3.5 months, vs 7.3 months, p < 0.001) compared to patients without BM. Patients who received bone targeted agents (BTAs) showed a significantly longer median OS (8.5 months vs 4.6 months, p = 0.003) and PFS (6.1 months vs 3.2 months, p = 0.003), while no survival benefits were observed among patients who received radiation therapy for BM during pembrolizumab treatment compared to those who did not. In multivariate analysis, performance status, concomitant liver metastases, and the lack of use of BTAs were significantly associated with worse OS and PFS. Bone involvement in UC patients treated with pembrolizumab predicts inferior survival. Poor performance status and liver metastases may further worsen outcomes, while the use of BTAs is associated with improved outcomes."

This study aims to identify risk factors related to hypoxemia during the emergence from anesthesia in patients undergoing RALP. A cohort of 316 patients undergoing RALP was divided into two groups: the hypoxemia group (N = 134) and the non-hypoxemia group (N = 182), based on their postoperative oxygen fraction. Comprehensive data were collected from the hospital information system, including preoperative baseline parameters, intraoperative data, and postoperative recovery profiles. Risk factors were examined using multiple logistic regression analysis. The study showed that 38.9% of patients had low preoperative partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) levels. Several clinical parameters showed significant differences between the hypoxemia group and the non-hypoxemia group, including weight (P < 0.0001), BMI (P < 0.0001), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.044), history of emphysema and pulmonary alveoli (P < 0.0001), low preoperative PaO2 (P < 0.0001), preoperative white blood cell count (P = 0.012), preoperative albumin (P = 0.048), intraoperative bleeding (P = 0.043), intraoperative CO2 accumulation (P = 0.001), duration of surgery (P = 0.046), postoperative hemoglobin level (P = 0.002), postoperative hypoxemia (P = 0.002), and early postoperative fever (P = 0.006).

Moreover, many biomarkers have been identified as predictors for ccRCC outcomes and response to therapeutic drugs, such as multitargeted tyrosine-kinase receptor (TKR) inhibitors, but little is known about their sex-specificity. Dyskerin (DKC1), encoded by the DKC1 gene within Xq28, is a telomerase co-factor stabilizing telomerase RNA component (TERC) and overexpressed in various cancers.

Analyses of the IMmotion 151 ccRCC cohort treated with the TKR inhibitor Sunitinib showed that female patients in the DKC1-high group was significantly associated with lower response rates (P = 0.021) accompanied by markedly shortened PFS (6.1 vs 14.2 months, P = 0.004). DKC1 and TERC expression correlated positively with each other, and higher TERC expression predicted poor Sunitinib response (P = 0.031) and shorter PFS (P = 0.004), too. However, DKC1 rather than TERC acted as an independent predictor (P < 0.001, HR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.480-2.704). In male patients, DKC1 expression was associated with neither Sunitinib response (P = 0.131) nor PFS (P = 0.184), while higher TERC levels did not predict response rates.

Patients and Methods In a phase 3, single-arm trial, patients with IR MGCT (stage II-IV testicular, II-III ovarian, I-II extragonadal, or stage I gonadal tumors with subsequent recurrence) received three cycles of PEb. A parametric comparator model specified that the observed EFS rate should not be significantly < 92%. As recommended for trials that test a reduction of therapy, a one-sided P value ≤ .10 was used to indicate statistical significance. In a post hoc analysis, we also compared results to the EFS rate of comparable patients treated with four cycles of PEb in two prior studies. Results Among 210 eligible patients enrolled from 2003 to 2011, 4-year EFS (EFS4) rate was 89% (95% confidence interval, 83% to 92%), which was significantly lower than the 92% threshold of the comparison model ( P = .08). Among 181 newly diagnosed patients, the EFS4 rate was 87%, compared with 92% for 92 comparable children in the historical cohort ( P = .15). The EFS4 rate was significantly associated with stage (stage I, 100%; stage II, 92%; stage III, 85%; and stage IV, 54%; P < .001). Conclusion The EFS rate for children with IR MGCT observed after three cycles of PEb was less than that of a prespecified parametric model, particularly for patients with higher-stage tumors. These data do not support a reduction in the number of cycles of PEb from four to three. However, further investigation of a reduction in the number of cycles for patients with lower-stage tumors is warranted."

Patients had 3 fiducials implanted then simulated and treated with a full bladder and empty rectum. Pretreatment orthogonal kVs and cone beam computed tomography were used to position patients and evaluate internal anatomy. Motion was tracked during volumetric modulated arc therapy delivery using simultaneously acquired kV and MV images from standard on-board systems. Treatment was interrupted to reposition patients when motion >1.5-2 mm was detected. Motion traces were analyzed and compared with Calypso traces from a previously treated similar patient cohort. To evaluate \"natural motion\" (ie, if we had not interrupted treatment and repositioned), intrafraction couch corrections were removed from all traces. Clinical effectiveness of the MV-kV system was explored by evaluating toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0) and biochemical recurrence rates (nadir + 2 ng/mL).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Median number of interruptions for patient repositioning was 1 per fraction (range, 0-9).

            "abstract": "Background Tissue estimates obtained by using microstructure imaging techniques, such as hybrid multidimensional (HM) MRI, may improve prostate cancer diagnosis but require histologic validation. Purpose To validate prostate tissue composition measured by using HM MRI, with quantitative histologic evaluation from whole-mount prostatectomy as the reference standard. Materials and Methods In this HIPAA-compliant study, from December 2016 to July 2018, prospective participants with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI before radical prostatectomy. Axial HM MRI was performed with all combinations of echo times (57, 70, 150, and 200 msec) and b values (0, 150, 750, and 1500 sec/mm2). Data were fitted by using a three-compartment signal model to generate volumes for each tissue component (stroma, epithelium, lumen). Quantitative histologic evaluation was performed to calculate volume fractions for each tissue component for regions of interest corresponding to MRI. Tissue composition measured by using HM MRI and quantitative histologic evaluation were compared (paired t test) and correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient), and agreement (concordance correlation) was assessed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for cancer diagnosis was performed. Results Twenty-five participants (mean age, 60 years ± 7 [standard deviation]; 30 cancers and 45 benign regions of interest) were included. Prostate tissue composition measured with HM MRI and quantitative histologic evaluation did not differ (stroma, 45% ± 11 vs 44% ± 11 [P = .23]; epithelium, 31% ± 15 vs 34% ± 15 [P = .08]; and lumen, 24% ± 13 vs 22% ± 11 [P = .80]). Between HM MRI and histologic evaluation, there was excellent correlation (Pearson r: overall, 0.91; stroma, 0.82; epithelium, 0.93; lumen, 0.90 [all P < .05]) and agreement (concordance correlation coefficient: overall, 0.91; stroma, 0.81; epithelium, 0.90; and lumen, 0.87). High areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve obtained with HM MRI (0.96 for epithelium and 0.94 for lumen, P < .001) and histologic evaluation (0.94 for epithelium and 0.88 for lumen, P < .001) were found for differentiation between benign tissue and prostate cancer. Conclusion Tissue composition measured by using hybrid multidimensional MRI had excellent correlation with quantitative histologic evaluation as the reference standard. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

We evaluated the association between cancer mortality and digoxin, sotalol and general antiarrhythmic drug use in a retrospective cohort study. The study population consists of 78,615 men originally identified for the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. Information on antiarrhythmic drug purchases was collected from the national prescription database. We used the Cox regression method to analyze separately overall cancer mortality and mortality from the most common types of cancer. During the median follow-up of 17.0 years after the baseline 28,936 (36.8%) men died, of these 8,889 due to cancer. 9,023 men (11.5%) had used antiarrhythmic drugs. Overall cancer mortality was elevated among antiarrhythmic drug users compared to non-users (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.34-1.53). Similar results were observed separately for digoxin and for sotalol. However, the risk associations disappeared in long-term use and were modified by background co-morbidities. All in all, cancer mortality was elevated among antiarrhythmic drug users. This association is probably non-causal as it was related to short-term use and disappeared in long-term use. Our results do not support the anticancer effects of digoxin or any other antiarrhythmic drug."

We aimed to identify and assess the possible prognostic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) biomarkers. LncRNAs expression data and corresponding clinical information of 619 ccRCC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) databases. Differentially expressed genes analysis, univariate Cox regression, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression model were utilized to identify hub lncRNAs. Multivariate Cox regression was used to establish the risk model. Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.5.3. The expression value of five lncRNAs and the risk-score levels were significantly associated with a survival prognosis of ccRCC patients (all P < .001). In the TCGA validation cohort, the area under the curve (AUC) for the integrated nomogram was 0.905 and 0.91 for 3-, 5-year prediction separately. The AUC reached up to 0.757 in an independent ICGC cohort. Besides, the calibration plots also illustrated well curve-fitting between observation values and predictive values. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis and subsequent pathway analysis revealed that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and hypoxia-inducible factor signaling crosstalk might function as the most essential mechanisms related to the five-lncRNAs signature. Our study suggested that lncRNA AC009654.1, AC092490.2, LINC00524, LINC01234, and LINC01885 were significantly associated with ccRCC prognosis. The prognostic model based on this five lncRNA may predict the overall survival of ccRCC."

Seventy-four men and sixty-seven women, aged 26-78 years, with a median age of 56, were included. In all patients, 118 with malignant tumors and 23 with benign tumors were confirmed. All the patients underwent renal T1 weighted imaging (T1WI), T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), and BOLD-MRI scan within 2 weeks before surgery. The patients were randomly assigned into a training group (benign, n=17; malignant, n=83) and a test group (benign, n=6; malignant, n=35). Two radiologists (A and B), who were blind to the pathological results, delineated the regions of interest (ROI) on the maximum axial slices of the tumors. Radiologist B delineated the ROI again at an interval of one month. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate inter-observer and intra-observer repeatability and ICC>0.75 represented as a good consistency. All the T2* Mapping images and the related ROI files were loaded into the Artificial Intelligence Kit software. A total of 396 texture features, which were calculated based on morphology, histogram, gray level co-occurrence matrix, gray-scale run length matrix, gray-scale area size matrix and gray-scale dependent matrix, were extracted from each ROI. The lowest redundancy and the highest correlation were filtered using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm. Then least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to screened out the most predictive features. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to develop the prediction model after feature selection. The radiomics signature score (Radscore) of each case was calculated. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the difference in the Radscore between benign and malignant renal tumors in the training and test groups. The diagnostic performance of the model in differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and leave group out cross validation.

The ICC values of all the texture features for the inter-observer repeatability were ranged from 0.71 to 0.87, and the ICC values for the intra-observer repeatability were ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. Thirty features with the lowest redundancy and the highest correlation were screened out. The most predictive 12 features were filtered out. The Radscores of malignant tumors in the training and test groups were higher than those of benign tumors (P<0.001 and P=0.006, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve of the model developed by multivariable logistic regression for differentiating malignant from benign renal tumors in the training and test groups were 0.881 and 0.706, with the accuracy at 82.93% and 79.00%, the sensitivity at 82.86% and 77.11%, and the specificities at 83.33% and 88.24%, respectively.

            "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly invasive urological malignant tumor that results in shorter patient survival. At present, the mechanism of ccRCC metastasis is not clear. We explored the possible mechanisms of ccRCC metastasis by analyzing the transcriptome of ccRCC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Comparing the differences in transcriptome in patients with and without metastasis, we found 323 differential genes (|log2FoldChange| > 1 and P < 0.001). KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) suggest that the transfer mechanism of ccRCC may be related to complement and coagulation cascades and cholesterol metabolism. To explore the key genes affecting tumor metastasis, we analyzed the association of these genes with patient survival time and found that 16 genes were significantly associated (P < 0.05). We compared the differences in expression of these 16 genes between ccRCC patients and the normal population, and the results showed that TF and B4GALNT1 were overexpressed in patients. Co-expression gene analysis indicated that TF may participate in the metastasis of cancer through the complement system and mucopolysaccharide biosynthesis. B4GALNT1 may affect metastasis through focal adhesion, calcium signaling pathways, and Hippo signaling pathways. Our studies suggest that the complement system and the coagulation cascade, cholesterol metabolism, calcium pathway and iron transport may be associated in the mechanism of metastasis. TF and B4GALNT1 may be the key genes for metastasis, and they may be potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for ccRCC."

A similar pattern (from -23.6% to +30.4%) was observed among 467 newly activated trials from June 2019 to June 2021. A more pronounced decline in new accruals was seen among academically sponsored trials (versus industry sponsored trials) (P < 0.05). In the manually curated cohort, which included 2361 patients with cancer, non-white patients tended to be more likely taken off trial in the early pandemic period (adjusted odds ratio: 2.60; 95% confidence interval 1.00-6.63), and substantial pandemic-related deviations were recorded.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Substantial disruptions in clinical trial activities were observed early during the pandemic, with a gradual recovery during ensuing time periods, both from an enrollment and an activation standpoint.

Twenty-six samples of normal control urothelium obtained from patients without urothelial carcinomas (C), 47 samples of non-cancerous urothelium without noticeable morphological changes obtained from patients with urothelial carcinomas (N), and 46 samples of the corresponding cancerous tissue (T) in the learning cohort and 64 N samples in the validation cohort, i.e. 183 tissue samples in total, were analyzed. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip, and DNA methylation levels were verified using pyrosequencing and MassARRAY. Amplicon sequencing was performed using the GeneRead DNAseq Targeted Panels V2. Although N samples rarely showed genetic mutations or copy number alterations, they showed DNA methylation alterations at 2502 CpG sites compared to C samples, and such alterations were inherited by or strengthened in T samples, indicating that DNA methylation alterations may participate in field cancerization in the urothelium. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis confirmed the feasibility of cancer risk estimation to identify urothelium at the precancerous stage by DNA methylation quantification. Cancer risk estimation permutation was established using a combination of two marker CpG loci on the HOXC4, TENM3 and TLR1 genes (sensitivity and specificity 96-100%). Among them, the diagnostic impact of 10 patterns of permutation was successfully validated in the validation cohort (sensitivity and specificity 94-98%). These data suggest that cancer risk estimation using procedures such as urine tests during health checkups might become applicable for clinical use."

To address this, we collected samples from 402 patients with UCB, including paired host transcriptome and tumor microbiome data, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that the intratumoral microbiome profiles were significantly correlated with the expression pattern of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. Furthermore, we detected that the genera Lachnoclostridium and Sutterella in tumors could indirectly promote the EMT program by inducing an inflammatory response. Moreover, the inflammatory response induced by these two intratumoral bacteria further enhanced intratumoral immune infiltration, affecting patient survival and response to immunotherapy. In addition, an independent immunotherapy cohort of 348 patients with bladder cancer was used to validate our results. Collectively, our study elucidates the potential mechanism by which the intratumoral microbiota influences the TIME of UCB and provides a new guiding strategy for the targeted therapy of UCB.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The intratumoral microbiota may mediate the bladder tumor inflammatory response, thereby promoting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition program and influencing tumor immune infiltration."

            "abstract": "PIM and PI3K/mTOR pathways are often dysregulated in prostate cancer, and may lead to decreased survival, increased metastasis and invasion. The pathways are heavily interconnected and act on a variety of common effectors that can lead to the development of resistance to drug inhibitors. Most current treatments exhibit issues with toxicity and resistance. We investigated the novel multikinase PIM/PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, AUM302, versus a combination of the PIM inhibitor, AZD-1208, and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 (Dactolisib) to determine their impact on mRNA and phosphoprotein expression, as well as their functional efficacy. We have determined that around 20% of prostate cancer patients overexpress the direct targets of these drugs, and this cohort are more likely to have a high Gleason grade tumour (≥ Gleason 8). A co-targeted inhibition approach offered broader inhibition of genes and phosphoproteins in the PI3K/mTOR pathway, when compared to single kinase inhibition. The preclinical inhibitor AUM302, used at a lower dose, elicited a comparable or superior functional outcome compared with combined AZD-1208 + BEZ235, which have been investigated in clinical trials, and could help to reduce treatment toxicity in future trials. We believe that a co-targeting approach is a viable therapeutic strategy that should be developed further in pre-clinical studies."

We investigated a cohort of decalcified formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) patient specimens from the bone that contained metastatic prostate cancer with lytic or blastic features. These tissue sections were utilized for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, isolation of RNA for gene expression, and Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) of changes in both the tumor and microenvironment. A diverse set of unique immune cell populations and signaling pathways to both lytic and blastic types of prostate cancer metastases were present. In blastic lesions immune cells were enriched for pSTAT3 and components of the JAK-STAT pathway. In lytic-type lesions, immune cells were enriched for pAKT activity and components of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Enrichment for immune checkpoints including PD-L1, B7-H4, OX40L, and IDO-1 were identified in blastic prostate cancer, providing new therapeutic targets for patients with bone metastases. Biopsies could guide selection of patients into appropriate therapeutic interventions based on protein levels and RNA expression of desired targets in metastatic disease. Molecular pathology has been an excellent complement to the diagnosis, treatment, and management of primary tumors and could be successfully extended to patients with metastatic lesions."

Using an unbiased, quantitative approach, this study evaluates the potential of three proteins of the 40S ribosomal protein complex as putative biomarkers of malignancy in prostate cancer. Prostate tissue arrays, constructed from 82 patient samples (245 tissue cores, stage pT3a or pT3b), were stained for antibodies against three ribosomal proteins, RPS19, RPS21 and RPS24. Semi-automated Ox-DAB signal quantification using ImageJ software revealed a significant change in expression of RPS19, RPS21 and RPS24 in malignant vs non-malignant tissue (p<0.0001). Receiver operating characteristics curves were calculated to evaluate the potential of each protein as a biomarker of malignancy in prostate cancer. Positive likelihood ratios for RPS19, RPS21 and RPS24 were calculated as 2.99, 4.21, and 2.56 respectively, indicating that the overexpression of the protein is correlated with the presence of disease. Triple-labelled, quantitative, immunofluorescence (with RPS19, RPS21 and RPS24) showed significant changes (p<0.01) in the global intersection coefficient, a measure of how often two fluorophore signals intersect, for RPS19 and RPS24 only. No change was observed in the co-localization of any other permutations of the three proteins. Our results show that RPS19, RPS21 or RPS24 are upregulated in malignant tissue and may serve as putative biomarkers for prostate cancer."

A novel group of co-morbidities derived from International Classification of Diseases-9 diagnostic codes in a contemporary RP database could provide better accuracy. Research Design, Subjects and Measures: We relied on 20,484 patients with clinically localized non-metastatic prostate cancer treated with RP between 2000 and 2009 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database. We examined 2 endpoints, namely, 90-day medical complication rate and 90-day surgical complication rate after RP. Simulated annealing (SA) was used to develop a novel co-morbidity index. Finally, the newly identified groups of co-morbid conditions were compared with the CCI and Klabunde indexes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Our SA identified 10 and 7 individual co-morbid conditions able to predict 90-day medical and surgical complications respectively. This novel model showed improved predictive accuracy over CCI and KCI for the 2 endpoints considered (respectively: 59.4 vs. 58.1 and 58.0% for medical complications, 58.0 vs. 56.8 and 56.7% for surgical complications).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The newly defined groupings of co-morbid conditions resulted in better ability to predict the 2 endpoints of interest compared to CCI and KCI. However, the gain was marginal. This implies that better tools should be defined to more accurately predict these outcomes."

To identify variables that help to predict risk of tumor recurrence, progression, and CSM. Materials and Methods: A prospective study of 251 consecutive patients with 399 recurrent NMIBC who underwent outpatient Holmium yttrium aluminium garnet laser ablation under topical anesthesia was carried out between September 2006 and September 2018. All patients underwent primary transurethral resection of bladder tumor to obtain histology. All patients completed a patient satisfaction questionnaire and visual analogue scale (VAS) for procedure-related pain. Results: All 251 patients were analyzed with an average age of 75.2 years and follow-up of 69.8 months. The majority of patients had multiple comorbidities with an American Society of Anesthesiologists of 3 or 4. The proportion of tumor grade 1, 2, and 3 disease and tumor stage Ta and T1 was 43.4%, 41.5%, 15.1%, 78.5%, and 21.5%, respectively. Overall, 57.8% of patients had at least one tumor recurrence with an average time of 16.3 months. Risk factors were tumor grade, number of tumors at time of first laser ablation, and tumor stage. Overall, 19.1% of patients demonstrated tumor progression with an average time of 51 months. Only 5.6% of patients had progression to muscle invasive bladder cancer, and the CSM rate was 5.2% with an average time to death of 71.2 months. Risk factors for CSM were tumor grade, stage, and the patient's age. The average VAS for pain was 0.6 out of 10, with all patients willing to have the procedure repeated if required. Conclusion: Laser ablation of NMIBC is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated long-term option for patients, particular in those who have moderate-to-severe co-morbidities. The long-term cancer outcomes are best for younger patients with primary low-grade and low-stage disease."

A 10-year retrospective cohort study including patients undergoing nephrectomy for ccRCC was also performed. PTX3 expression was elevated in both neoplastic renal cell lines and tissues, while it was absent in both normal renal proximal tubular cells (HK2) and normal renal tissues. Analysis of complement system activation on tumor tissues showed the co-expression of PTX3 with C1q, C3aR, C5R1 and CD59, but not with C5b-9 terminal complex. RCC patients showed higher serum PTX3 levels as compared to non-neoplastic patients (p<0.0001). Higher PTX3 serum levels were observed in patients with higher Fuhrman grade (p<0.01), lymph node (p<0.0001), and visceral metastases (p<0.001). Patients with higher PTX3 levels also showed significantly lower survival rates (p=0.002). Our results suggest that expression of PTX3 can affect the immunoflogosis in the ccRCC microenvironment, by activating the classical pathway of CS (C1q) and releasing pro-angiogenic factors (C3a, C5a).

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) used as a triage test might allow men to avoid unnecessary TRUS-guided biopsy and improve diagnostic accuracy.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To (1) assess the ability of mpMRI to identify men who can safely avoid unnecessary biopsy, (2) assess the ability of the mpMRI-based pathway to improve the rate of detection of clinically significant (CS) cancer compared with TRUS-guided biopsy and (3) estimate the cost-effectiveness of a mpMRI-based diagnostic pathway.\n    \n\n\n          Design:\n        \n      \n      A validating paired-cohort study and an economic evaluation using a decision-analytic model.\n    \n\n\n          Setting:\n        \n      \n      Eleven NHS hospitals in England.\n    \n\n\n          Participants:\n        \n      \n      Men at risk of prostate cancer undergoing a first prostate biopsy.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Participants underwent three tests: (1) mpMRI (the index test), (2) TRUS-guided biopsy (the current standard) and (3) template prostate mapping (TPM) biopsy (the reference test).\n    \n\n\n          Main outcome measures:\n        \n      \n      Diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI, TRUS-guided biopsy and TPM-biopsy measured by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) using primary and secondary definitions of CS cancer. The percentage of negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans was used to identify men who might be able to avoid biopsy.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Diagnostic study - a total of 740 men were registered and 576 underwent all three tests. According to TPM-biopsy, the prevalence of any cancer was 71% [95% confidence interval (CI) 67% to 75%]. The prevalence of CS cancer according to the primary definition (a Gleason score of ≥ 4 + 3 and/or cancer core length of ≥ 6 mm) was 40% (95% CI 36% to 44%). For CS cancer, TRUS-guided biopsy showed a sensitivity of 48% (95% CI 42% to 55%), specificity of 96% (95% CI 94% to 98%), PPV of 90% (95% CI 83% to 94%) and NPV of 74% (95% CI 69% to 78%). The sensitivity of mpMRI was 93% (95% CI 88% to 96%), specificity was 41% (95% CI 36% to 46%), PPV was 51% (95% CI 46% to 56%) and NPV was 89% (95% CI 83% to 94%). A negative mpMRI scan was recorded for 158 men (27%). Of these, 17 were found to have CS cancer on TPM-biopsy. Economic evaluation - the most cost-effective strategy involved testing all men with mpMRI, followed by MRI-guided TRUS-guided biopsy in those patients with suspected CS cancer, followed by rebiopsy if CS cancer was not detected. This strategy is cost-effective at the TRUS-guided biopsy definition 2 (any Gleason pattern of ≥ 4 and/or cancer core length of ≥ 4 mm), mpMRI definition 2 (lesion volume of ≥ 0.2 ml and/or Gleason score of ≥ 3 + 4) and cut-off point 2 (likely to be benign) and detects 95% (95% CI 92% to 98%) of CS cancers. The main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the unit costs of tests, the improvement in sensitivity of MRI-guided TRUS-guided biopsy compared with blind TRUS-guided biopsy and the longer-term costs and outcomes of men with cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Limitations:\n        \n      \n      The PROstate Magnetic resonance Imaging Study (PROMIS) was carried out in a selected group and excluded men with a prostate volume of > 100 ml, who are less likely to have cancer. The limitations in the economic modelling arise from the limited evidence on the long-term outcomes of men with prostate cancer and on the sensitivity of MRI-targeted repeat biopsy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Incorporating mpMRI into the diagnostic pathway as an initial test prior to prostate biopsy may (1) reduce the proportion of men having unnecessary biopsies, (2) improve the detection of CS prostate cancer and (3) increase the cost-effectiveness of the prostate cancer diagnostic and therapeutic pathway. The PROMIS data set will be used for future research; this is likely to include modelling prognostic factors for CS cancer, optimising MRI scan sequencing and biomarker or translational research analyses using the blood and urine samples collected. Better-quality evidence on long-term outcomes in prostate cancer under the various management strategies is required to better assess cost-effectiveness. The value-of-information analysis should be developed further to assess new research to commission.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN16082556 and NCT01292291.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      This project was funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in Health Technology Assessment; Vol. 22, No. 39.

An overwhelming increase of patients experience tumor progression and unfavorable prognosis. However, the molecular events underlying ccRCC tumorigenesis and metastasis remain unclear. Therefore, uncovering the underlying mechanisms will pave the way for developing novel therapeutic targets for ccRCC. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of mitofusin-2 (MFN2) in supressing ccRCC tumorigenesis and metastasis.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The expression pattern and clinical significance of MFN2 in ccRCC were analyzed by using the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets and samples from our independent ccRCC cohort. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments, including cell proliferation, xenograft mouse models and transgenic mouse model, were used to determine the role of MFN2 in regulating the malignant behaviors of ccRCC. RNA-sequencing, mass spectrum analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, bio-layer interferometry and immunofluorescence were employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms for the tumor-supressing role of MFN2.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      we reported a tumor-suppressing pathway in ccRCC, characterized by mitochondria-dependent inactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. This process was mediated by the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) protein MFN2. MFN2 was down-regulated in ccRCC and associated with favorable prognosis of ccRCC patients. in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that MFN2 inhibited ccRCC tumor growth and metastasis by suppressing the EGFR signaling pathway. In a kidney-specific knockout mouse model, loss of MFN2 led to EGFR pathway activation and malignant lesions in kidney. Mechanistically, MFN2 preferably binded small GTPase Rab21 in its GTP-loading form, which was colocalized with endocytosed EGFR in ccRCC cells. Through this EGFR-Rab21-MFN2 interaction, endocytosed EGFR was docked to mitochondria and subsequently dephosphorylated by the OMM-residing tyrosine-protein phosphatase receptor type J (PTPRJ).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings uncover an important non-canonical mitochondria-dependent pathway regulating EGFR signaling by the Rab21-MFN2-PTPRJ axis, which contributes to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ccRCC."

            "abstract": "Several studies have indicated weakly increased risk for kidney cancer among occupational groups exposed to gasoline vapors, engine exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other air pollutants, although not consistently. It was the aim to investigate possible associations between outdoor air pollution at the residence and the incidence of kidney parenchyma cancer in the general population. We used data from 14 European cohorts from the ESCAPE study. We geocoded and assessed air pollution concentrations at baseline addresses by land-use regression models for particulate matter (PM10 , PM2.5 , PMcoarse , PM2.5 absorbance (soot)) and nitrogen oxides (NO2 , NOx ), and collected data on traffic. We used Cox regression models with adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and random effects models for meta-analyses to calculate summary hazard ratios (HRs). The 289,002 cohort members contributed 4,111,908 person-years at risk. During follow-up (mean 14.2 years) 697 incident cancers of the kidney parenchyma were diagnosed. The meta-analyses showed higher HRs in association with higher PM concentration, e.g. HR = 1.57 (95%CI: 0.81-3.01) per 5 μg/m3 PM2.5 and HR = 1.36 (95%CI: 0.84-2.19) per 10-5 m-1 PM2.5 absorbance, albeit never statistically significant. The HRs in association with nitrogen oxides and traffic density on the nearest street were slightly above one. Sensitivity analyses among participants who did not change residence during follow-up showed stronger associations, but none were statistically significant. Our study provides suggestive evidence that exposure to outdoor PM at the residence may be associated with higher risk for kidney parenchyma cancer; the results should be interpreted cautiously as associations may be due to chance."

Manual delineation of volume-of-interests (VOIs) was performed on multiple normal organs displaying high [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, as well as pathological lesions. Time-to-activity curves (TACs) were generated, and the four compartment models including one-tissue compartmental model (1T1k), reversible one-tissue compartmental model (1T2k), irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2T3k) and reversible two-tissue compartmental model (2T4k) were fitted to each tissue TAC. Various rate constants, including K1 (forward transport rate from plasma to the reversible compartment), k2 (reverse transport rate from the reversible compartment to plasma), k3 (tracer binding on the PSMA-receptor and its internalization), k4 (the externalization rate of the tracer) and Ki (net influx rate), were obtained. The selection of the optimal model for describing the uptake of both lesions and normal organs was determined using the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the cut-off values for differentiating physiological and pathological [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Both 1T1k and 1T2k models showed relatively high AIC values compared to the 2T3k and 2T4k models in both pathological lesions and normal organs. The kinetic behavior of pathological lesions was better described by the 2T3k model compared to the 2T4k model, while the normal organs were better described by the 2T4k model. Significant variations in kinetic metrics, such as K1, k2, and k3, and Ki, were observed among normal organs with high [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake and pathological lesions. The high Ki value in normal organs was primarily determined by elevated K1 and low k3, rather than k2. Conversely, the high Ki value in pathological lesions, ranking second to the kidney and similar to salivary glands and spleen, was predominantly determined by the highest k3 value. Notably, k3 exhibited the highest performance in distinguishing between physiological and pathological [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.844 (95% CI, 0.773-0.915), sensitivity of 82.9%, and specificity of 74.1%. The k3 values showed better performance than SUVmean (AUC, 0.659), SUVmax (AUC, 0.637), and other kinetic parameter including K1 (AUC, 0.604), k2 (AUC, 0.634), and Ki (AUC, 0.651).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Significant discrepancies in kinetic metrics were detected between pathological lesions and normal organs, despite their shared high uptake of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11.

Withdrawal of the European Medicines Agency approval application by the manufacturer made it impossible for patients to benefit from this agent; a loss, especially for men with prostate cancer. Current conventional imaging techniques are not as accurate as CEM is, thus a surgical diagnostic exploration (extended lymph node dissection) is still the preferred technique to evaluate the lymph nodes, resulting in peri- and postoperative complications. In 2013, the Radboud University Medical Center (Radboudumc) obtained all licenses and documentation for the production process of Combidex (ferumoxtran-10), and manufactured the contrast agent under supervision of the Department of Pharmacy.

Several studies have shown a weak association between anthropometric characteristics and bladder cancer, although most studies in European populations did not confirm these findings. Similarly in our case-control study in a Greek population, we found potential relationship between increased weight/BMI and waist circumference with bladder cancer, but the association disappeared in multivariate analysis."

An analysis of pooled phase III data suggested differences in overall survival (OS) between African American and Caucasian men receiving sipuleucel-T. We explored this in PROCEED (NCT01306890), an FDA-requested registry in over 1900 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with sipuleucel-T.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      OS for patients who received ≥1 sipuleucel-T infusion was compared between African American and Caucasian men using an all patient set and a baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-matched set (two Caucasians to every one African American with baseline PSAs within 10% of each other). Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted.

Overall survival differed between African American and Caucasian men with hazard ratios (HR) of 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.97, P = 0.03) in the all patient set and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.57-0.86, P < 0.001) in the PSA-matched set. Median OS was longer in African Americans than in Caucasian men for both analysis sets, e.g., 35.3 and 25.8 months, respectively, in the PSA-matched set. Similar results were observed in the all patient set. Differences were larger when treatment began at lower baseline PSA; curves were more similar among patients with higher baseline PSA. In patients with baseline PSA below the median, the HR was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37-0.72, P < 0.001), with median OS of 54.3 versus 33.4 months. Known prognostic factors and African American race (multivariable analyses; HR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.48-0.74, P < 0.001) were independently associated with OS.

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most prevalent malignancy and the fifth cause of cancer-related deaths in men. A crucial challenge is identifying the population at risk of rapid progression from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We collected 78 HSPC biopsies and measured their proteomes using pressure cycling technology and a pulsed data-independent acquisition pipeline. We quantified 7355 proteins using these HSPC biopsies. A total of 251 proteins showed differential expression between patients with a long- or short-term progression to CRPC. Using a random forest model, we identified seven proteins that significantly discriminated long- from short-term progression patients, which were used to classify PCa patients with an area under the curve of 0.873. Next, one clinical feature (Gleason sum) and two proteins (BGN and MAPK11) were found to be significantly associated with rapid disease progression. A nomogram model using these three features was generated for stratifying patients into groups with significant progression differences (p-value = 1.3×10-4). To conclude, we identified proteins associated with a fast progression to CRPC and an unfavorable prognosis. Based on these proteins, our machine learning and nomogram models stratified HSPC into high- and low-risk groups and predicted their prognoses. These models may aid clinicians in predicting the progression of patients, guiding individualized clinical management and decisions."

Using mixed Poisson regression models, we calculated the relative risk (RR) for COPD for each 100 Bq/m3 of increase in radon concentration and also the relative risk for COPD using a cut-off point of 50 Bq/m3. We did not have individual data on cigarette smoking and therefore we used a proxy (bladder cancer standardized mortality rate) that has proved to account for tobacco consumption.

Although whole-genome/exome sequencing analysis has revealed that nuclear genome alterations are associated with clinical outcomes, the association between nucleotide alterations in the mitochondrial genome and RCC clinical outcomes remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed somatic mutations in the mitochondrial D-loop region, using RCC samples from 61 consecutive patients with localized RCC. Moreover, we analyzed the relationship between D-loop mutations and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (MT-ND1) mutations, which we previously found to be associated with clinical outcomes in localized RCC. Among the 61 localized RCCs, 34 patients (55.7%) had at least one mitochondrial D-loop mutation. The number of D-loop mutations was associated with larger tumor diameter (> 32 mm) and higher nuclear grade (≥ ISUP grade 3). Moreover, patients with D-loop mutations showed no differences in cancer-specific survival when compared with patients without D-loop mutations. However, the co-occurrence of D-loop and MT-ND1 mutations improved the predictive accuracy of cancer-related deaths among our cohort, increasing the concordance index (C-index) from 0.757 to 0.810. Thus, we found that D-loop mutations are associated with adverse pathological features in localized RCC and may improve predictive accuracy for cancer-specific deaths when combined with MT-ND1 mutations."

Among tested organisms, the rate of Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg) infection was significantly different between the prostate cancer cohort and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) cohort (P = 0.03). Mg infection in the surgical specimens was associated with younger patients. The rate of extensive disease (pT2c⁻3b) was higher in Mg-positive patients than in Mg-negative patients (P = 0.027). No significant correlation was observed between Mg infection status and the grade of intraprostatic inflammation. The detection sensitivity of biopsy specimens was 61% for Mg and 60% for human papillomavirus (HPV)18, indicating possible clinical application of this material.

There were no treatment-related deaths.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this multicenter cohort study suggest that ICI rechallenge in patients with mRCC may be safe and reasonably efficacious, with an overall response rate of 23%.

            "abstract": "Body composition parameters are not captured by measures of body mass, which may explain inconsistent associations between body weight and prostate cancer (PC) risk. The objective of this systematic review was to characterize the association between fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) parameters and PC risk. A search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science identified case-control and cohort studies that measured body composition in relation to PC risk. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Thirteen observational studies were included, of which 8 were case-control studies (n = 1572 cases, n = 1937 controls) and 5 were prospective cohort studies (n = 7854 incident cases with PC). The NOS score was 5.9 ± 1.1 for case-control studies and 8.4 ± 1.3 for cohort studies. The most common body composition technique was bioelectrical impedance analysis (n = 9 studies), followed by DXA (n = 2), computed tomography (n = 2), air displacement plethysmography (n = 1), and MRI (n = 1). No case-control studies reported differences in %FM between PC cases and controls and no consistent differences in FM or FFM (in kilograms) were observed. Two out of 5 cohort studies reported that higher %FM was associated with lower PC risk. Conversely, 3 cohort studies reported a greater risk of being diagnosed with advanced/aggressive PC with higher FM (expressed in kilograms, %FM, or fat distribution). Two out of 4 studies (both case-control and cohort) found that higher abdominal adipose tissue was associated with increased PC risk. In conclusion, although results were inconsistent, there is some evidence that FM may be negatively associated with total PC risk but positively associated with the risk of advanced/aggressive PC; modest evidence suggests that abdominal adipose tissue may increase the risk of PC. Future work should elucidate unique patterns of FM distribution and PC risk to triage men at risk for developing PC. This study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) database as CRD42019133388."

            "abstract": "For the estimation of perioperative risks and mortality in the context of radical urological tumor surgery in elderly patients, the guidelines meanwhile require the use of geriatric assessments. The aim of this work is therefore to explain frequently used geriatric assessments and to give an overview of their predictive significance in radical urological tumor surgery. Comprehensive geriatric assessments provide a good description of the patient's state of health, but are hardly feasible in clinical routine due to their complexity. It is more reasonable to use screening tools with subsequent targeted examination of high-risk patients. Special tools allow the standardized assessment of functional status, mobility, cognition, mood, nutrition, frailty, comorbidities and polypharmacy and have different prognostic significance. Evidence on the predictive value of assessments prior to radical urological tumor surgery is mainly described for the systematic classification of comorbidities. In cystectomy, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score allow an estimation of the risk of complications and mortality. The focus of assessments prior to prostatectomy is to identify patients with sufficient life expectancy to benefit from radical surgery. CCI and ASA scores as well as the Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group (ECOG) score can help to assess the risk of perioperative complications in kidney tumor surgery."

Participants had locally advanced inoperable (cT4b or N+, or both) or metastatic (M1) (or both) urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or upper urinary tract.

We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

The RCTs included 3572 participants comparing immunotherapy versus chemotherapy for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer. First-line therapy Immunotherapy probably has little to no effect on the risk of death from any cause when used as first-line therapy compared to chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87 to 1.07; I2 = 0%; 3 studies, 2068 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 750 deaths per 1000 participants with chemotherapy and 11 fewer (45 fewer to 26 more) deaths per 1000 participants with immunotherapy at 36 months. Immunotherapy probably has little to no effect on health-related quality of life (mean difference (MD) 4.10, 95% CI 3.83 to 4.37; 1 study, 393 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), when assuming a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of at least 6 points (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Bladder [FACT-BL] tool; scale 0 to 156 with higher scores representing better quality of life). Immunotherapy probably reduces adverse events grade 3 to 5 (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.75; I2 = 97%; 3 studies, 2046 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 908 grade 3 to 5 adverse events per 1000 participants with chemotherapy, with 481 fewer (644 fewer to 227 fewer) grade 3 to 5 adverse events per 1000 participants with immunotherapy. We found no evidence for the outcome time to death from bladder cancer. Immunotherapy probably increases the risk of time to disease progression (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.50; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 1349 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 660 events per 1000 participants with chemotherapy and 102 more (57 more to 152 more) events per 1000 participants with immunotherapy at 36 months. Immunotherapy may reduce discontinuations due to adverse effects (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.10; I2 = 94%; 3 studies, 2046 participants; low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 338 discontinuations per 1000 participants with chemotherapy and 179 fewer (271 fewer to 34 more) discontinuations per 1000 participants with immunotherapy. Second-line therapy Immunotherapy may reduce the risk of death from any cause when used as second-line therapy (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.81; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 1473 participants; low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 920 deaths per 1000 participants with chemotherapy (vinflunine, paclitaxel, docetaxel) and 59 fewer (95 fewer to 28 fewer) deaths per 1000 participants with immunotherapy at 36 months. Immunotherapy may have little to no effect on health-related quality of life when compared to chemotherapy (MD 4.82, 95% CI -3.11 to 12.75; I2 = 85%; 2 studies, 727 participants; low-certainty evidence), assuming an MCID of at least 10 points (using the EORTC QLQ tool; scale 0 to 100 with higher scores representing better quality of life). Immunotherapy may reduce adverse events grade 3 to 5 in participants undergoing second-line therapy (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.97; I2 = 9%; 2 studies, 1423 participants; low-certainty evidence). This corresponds to 630 grade 3 to 5 adverse events per 1000 participants with chemotherapy and 76 fewer (126 fewer to 25 fewer) grade 3 to 5 adverse events per 1000 participants with immunotherapy. We found no evidence for the outcome of time to death from bladder cancer. We are very uncertain if immunotherapy reduces the risk of disease progression (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.16; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 1473 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Immunotherapy may reduce discontinuations due to adverse events in participants undergoing second-line therapy (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; I2 = 69%; 2 studies, 1473 participants; low-certainty evidence).

Still, it may reduce the risk of death from any cause when used as second-line therapy. Health-related quality of life for participants receiving first- and second-line therapy does not appear to be affected by immunotherapy.

The predictive value of PGES for immunotherapy was validated in the IMvigor210 cohort. Multiple algorithms were used in analyzing the correlation between PGES and immune cells. The sensitivity of PGES to chemotherapeutic drugs was analyzed with the \"pRRophetic\" package. We validated the genes that develop PGES in tissue samples. Finally, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used in identifying the key PMRGs closely related to ccRCC, and cell function experiments were carried out.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PMRGs were abundantly expressed on tumor cells, and PMRG expression was active in CD8+ T cells and fibroblasts. We identified three PMRG expression subtypes. Cancer and immune related pathways were active in PMRG expression cluster A, which had better prognosis. PGES exhibited excellent predictive value. The high-PGES group was characterized by high immune cell infiltration, high expression of T cell depletion markers, high tumor mutation burden and tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, was insensitive to immunotherapy but sensitive to sunitinib, temsirolimus, and rapamycin, and had poor prognosis. Spermidine synthetase (SRM) has been identified as a key gene and is highly expressed in ccRCC at RNA and protein levels.

Examining incident urinary tract cancers by CKD severity, risks were elevated in stage 3 CKD (kidney aHR 1.89, 95% CI 1.56-2.30; urothelial carcinoma aHR 1.35, 95% CI 1.20-1.52) as well as in stages 4/5 CKD (kidney cancer aHR 2.30, 95% CI 2.00-2.66; urothelial carcinoma aHR 1.24, 95% CI 1.04-1.49).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Even moderate CKD is associated with elevated risk of kidney cancer and urothelial carcinoma.

            "abstract": "Drugs targeting VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) are often associated with rapid development of hypertension by a yet not fully understood mechanism. VEGF is expressed in renal epithelial cells and stimulates NO production. In the renal medulla, inhibition of NO formation by local L-NAME or by impaired endothelin-1 leads to hypertension. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that VEGF receptor inhibitor treatment leads to hypertension through decreased renal medullary formation of NO and endothelin-1. With a single-center prospective observational design, patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (n=27) treated with the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor pazopanib were included in the study. Home blood pressure was measured, and plasma and urine samples were collected at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. After 4 weeks, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased, whereas heart rate decreased significantly; urine protein/creatinine ratio increased significantly, whereas estimated glomerular filtration rate was unchanged. Urine nitrite/nitrate (NOx) and cGMP/creatinine ratios decreased significantly, whereas urine endothelin-1/creatinine ratio and FENa+ were unchanged. In plasma, NOx, cGMP, and brain natriuretic peptide decreased significantly, whereas endothelin-1 was significantly elevated. Blood leukocyte count decreased significantly with unchanged CRP (C-reactive protein). In summary, pazopanib treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma is associated with hypertension, proteinuria, myelosuppression, and decreased urine and plasma NO metabolites. Results are compatible with a significant role of reduced renal medullary NO bioavailability in VEGF inhibitor-induced hypertension."

Areas covered: Bone metastases represent a substantial cause of morbidity in mCRPC with a high rate of related skeletal events (SREs). In case of multifocal pain due to diffuse osteoblastic metastases, treatment with bone-targeting radiopharmaceutical agents can provide palliation from pain. Radium-223, a calcium-mimetic, is the first α-particle emitting radiopharmaceutical that prolonged overall survival, delayed symptomatic skeletal events and improved quality of life in mCRPC. Expert opinion: In this therapeutic scenario, no clear evidences support the best way to sequence these available agents and there is an urgent need for prospective studies to define it. 223Ra is a firmly established therapeutic option in CRPC with symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral/bulky nodal involvement, with an undeniable advantage over new hormonal agents, given its peculiar mechanism of action. Current ongoing randomized clinical trials will clarify the optimal use of this effective therapy in the therapeutic armamentarium of CRPC either alone or combined with other new approved agents and whether there is a role in patients with asymptomatic disease."

However, the beneficiaries of immunotherapy are still limited to small-scale patients, and immunotherapy-related adverse events often occur. It is a major challenge for clinical work to study the immune subtypes of BC and the molecular mechanism of immune escape, and identify the immune responders accurately. Here, we explore the immune molecular subtypes of bladder cancer and potential escape mechanisms. First, we screened the expression profiles of 303 differentially expressed immune-related genes in BC patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and successfully identified 4 molecular subtypes of BC. By comparing the clinical characteristics, immune cells infiltration, the expression of checkpoint genes, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, and gene mutation status of different subtypes, we identified different clinical and immunological characteristics of 4 subtypes. Among 4 subtypes, Cluster 2 met the general characteristics of immunotherapy responders and responded well to immunotherapy, while Cluster 4 had the highest expression of immune characteristics, and is similar to the immune environment of normal bladder tissue. Then, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of immune-related genes revealed that brown module was positively correlated with subtypes. Pathway enrichment analysis explored the major pathways associated with subtypes, which are also associated with immune escape mechanisms. Moreover, the decision tree model, which was constructed by the principle of random forest screening factors, was also validated in internal validation set and external validation set from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohort (GSE133624), and could achieve accurate subtypes prediction for BC patients with high-throughput sequencing. Taken together, we explored the immune molecular subtypes and their mechanisms of BC, and these results may provide guidance for the development of new BC immunotherapy strategies."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      Radical nephrectomy is the gold standard in Wilms tumor (WT) treatment and is combined with adjuvant treatment in early stage disease or performed after neo adjuvant therapy in advanced disease. With the development of novel adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapeutic strategies, there is increasing interest in organ preserving procedures in several adult malignancies. Potential long-term complications of living with a single kidney include hyperfiltration syndrome, hypertension, and fluid retention. If NSS (Nephron Sparing Surgery) were to be adopted for the treatment of WT it would be necessary to preserve the gains in Overall Survival (OS) seen with current treatment protocols. With this in mind we undertook a study of outcomes of NSS performed in the USA using a large population-based registry.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We retrospectively queried the SEER Research Plus 18-registries Database 2010-2018 for patients 18 years old or younger with Wilms tumor as determined by ICD-O-3 code 8960. Clinical and demographic data was extracted, and statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad PRISM 9 with bivariate analysis and log-rank analysis to determine survival.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      1087 patients with Wilms tumor were identified. 73 (6.72%) underwent nephron-sparing surgery. The final cohort consisted of 45 patients (64%) who underwent unilateral NSS and 25 patients (36%) who underwent bilateral NSS. Three were excluded from analysis due to non-renal origin of tumor. Mean age was 3.214 years (std dev 3.807). Demographics were similar between the groups, apart from younger age associated with bilateral tumor (p = 0.0441). No differences were found between radiation use (p = 0.4280), chemotherapy use (p = 0.5479), tumor size (p = 0.2186), positive regional lymph nodes (p = 0.707). Log-rank analysis demonstrated that cancer-specific survival was not significantly different between unilateral and bilateral NSS or radical nephrectomy (p = 0.4539).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      NSS may preserve renal function long-term, an important consideration in the pediatric population. Prospective study is necessary to select the appropriate patient subsets who may benefit from NSS in WT."

All included studies were retrospective and conducted in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Nine studies reported on the risk of extraprostatic extension, seven on the risk of lymph node invasion, three on the risk of biochemical recurrence and nine on the improvement of PCa risk stratification. Overall, the combination of TB with imaging, clinical and biochemical parameters outperformed current pretherapeutic risk assessment models. External validation studies are lacking for certain endpoints and the absence of standardization among TB protocols, including number of TB cores and fusion systems, may limit the generalizability of the results.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      TB should be incorporated in pretherapeutic risk assessment models to improve clinical decision making. Further high-quality studies are required to determine models' generalizability while there is an urgent need to reach consensus on a standardized TB protocol.

Weekly magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans were acquired for 5 weeks for each patient to observe the anatomic changes during the treatment course. Initial intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans (iIMRT) were generated for each patient with 13 coplanar 60Co beams on a ViewRay™ system. Two techniques were applied: patient repositioning and replanning. For patient repositioning, one plan was created: soft-tissue (prostate) matching (Soft). The dose distribution was calculated for each MRI with the beam delivery parameters from the initial IMRT plan. The replanning technique was used to generate the Adaptive plan, which was the reoptimized plan for the weekly MRI. The dose-volumetric parameters of the planning target volume (PTV), bladder, and rectum were calculated for all plans. During the treatment course, the PTV, bladder, and rectum were evaluated for changes in volume and the effect on dosimetric parameters. The differences between the dose-volumetric parameters of the plans were examined through the Wilcoxon test. The initial plan was used as a baseline to compare the differences.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The Adaptive plan showed better target coverage during the treatment period, but the change was not significant in the Soft plan.

There was no significant change in Dmax and Dmean as the treatment progressed with all plans. All indices for the Adaptive plan stayed the same compared to those of iIMRT during the treatment course. There were significant differences in D15%, D25%, D35%, and D50% in the bladder between the Soft and Adaptive plans. The Adaptive plan showed the worse dose sparing than the Soft plan for the bladder according to each dosimetric index.

The Adaptive plan did not clinically improve for the dose delivered to OARs, it kept the dose delivered to the target volume constant. However, the Adaptive plan is beneficial when the organ positions and volumes change considerable during treatment."

            "abstract": "Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is an immunologically cold disease with dismal outcomes. Cryoablation destroys cancer tissue, releases tumor-associated antigens and creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, while dendritic cells (DCs) activate immune responses through processing of antigens. Immunotherapy combinations could enhance the anti-tumor efficacy. This open-label, single-arm, single-center phase I trial determined the safety and tolerability of combining cryoablation and autologous immature DC, without and with checkpoint inhibitors. Immune responses and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Patients with mCRPC, confirmed metastases and intact prostate gland were included. The first participants underwent prostate cryoablation with intratumoral injection of autologous DCs in a 3 + 3 design. In the second part, patients received cryoablation, the highest acceptable DC dose, and checkpoint inhibition with either ipilimumab or pembrolizumab. Sequentially collected information on adverse events, quality of life, blood values and images were analyzed by standard descriptive statistics. Neither dose-limiting toxicities nor adverse events > grade 3 were observed in the 18 participants. Results indicate antitumor activity through altered T cell receptor repertoires, and 33% durable (> 46 weeks) clinical benefit with median 40.7 months overall survival. Post-treatment pain and fatigue were associated with circulating tumor cell (CTC) presence at inclusion, while CTC responses correlated with clinical outcomes. This trial demonstrates that cryoimmunotherapy in mCRPC is safe and well tolerated, also for the highest DC dose (2.0 × 108) combined with checkpoint inhibitors. Further studies focusing on the biologic indications of antitumor activity and immune system activation could be considered through a phase II trial focusing on treatment responses and immunologic biomarkers."

The longitudinal analysis of peripheral CD8+ T cell recognition of patient-specific neopeptide libraries consisting of DNA barcode-labelled pMHC multimers in a cohort of 24 patients from the clinical trial NCT02108652 also shows that peripheral NARTs derived from patients with disease control are characterised by a PD1+ Ki67+ effector phenotype and increased CD39 levels compared to bystander bulk- and virus-antigen reactive CD8+ T cells.

            "abstract": "The use of taxanes has for decades been crucial for treatment of several cancers. A major limitation of these therapies is inherent or acquired drug resistance. A key to improved outcome of taxane-based therapies is to develop tools to predict and monitor drug efficacy and resistance in the clinical setting allowing for treatment and dose stratification for individual patients. To assess treatment efficacy up to the level of drug target engagement, we have established several formats of tubulin-specific Cellular Thermal Shift Assays (CETSAs). This technique was evaluated in breast and prostate cancer models and in a cohort of breast cancer patients. Here we show that taxanes induce significant CETSA shifts in cell lines as well as in animal models including patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Furthermore, isothermal dose response CETSA measurements allowed for drugs to be rapidly ranked according to their reported potency. Using multidrug resistant cancer cell lines and taxane-resistant PDX models we demonstrate that CETSA can identify taxane resistance up to the level of target engagement. An imaging-based CETSA format was also established, which in principle allows for taxane target engagement to be accessed in specific cell types in complex cell mixtures. Using a highly sensitive implementation of CETSA, we measured target engagement in fine needle aspirates from breast cancer patients, revealing a range of different sensitivities. Together, our data support that CETSA is a robust tool for assessing taxane target engagement in preclinical models and clinical material and therefore should be evaluated as a prognostic tool during taxane-based therapies."

We identified the BCa-specific methylation markers by combined analyses of cohorts from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital (SYSMH), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The BCa diagnostic model was built in a retrospective cohort (n = 313) and validated in a multicenter, prospective cohort (n = 175). The performance of this diagnostic assay was analyzed and compared with urine cytology and FISH.RESULTSWe first discovered 26 significant methylation markers of BCa in combined analyses. We built and validated a 2-marker-based diagnostic model that discriminated among patients with BCa with high accuracy (86.7%), sensitivity (90.0%), and specificity (83.1%). Furthermore, the utMeMA-based assay achieved a great improvement in sensitivity over urine cytology and FISH, especially in the detection of early-stage (stage Ta and low-grade tumor, 64.5% vs. 11.8%, 15.8%), minimal (81.0% vs. 14.8%, 37.9%), residual (93.3% vs. 27.3%, 64.3%), and recurrent (89.5% vs. 31.4%, 52.8%) tumors.

This study compares the genomic and transcriptomic landscape, and targeted treatment options between metastatic UTC (mUTC) patients treated with multiple lines of therapy compared to newly diagnosed, untreated Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We compared genomic and clinical data from two cohorts: mUTC patients who received multiple lines of therapy and were referred to the Copenhagen Prospective Personalized Oncology (CoPPO) project at Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen. Data for MIBC UTC patients were acquired from the Cancer Genome Atlas Bladder Cancer (TCGA BLCA) cohort. Biopsies in CoPPO were performed at the time of enrollment. 523 highly important cancer-related genes (TrueSight Oncology-500 targeted sequencing panel) were used from both cohorts for comparative analysis. Analyses included RNA count data to compare predicted molecular subtypes in each cohort separately.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients from the CoPPO cohort had a lower median age at first-line treatment than the TCGA BLCA cohort, with no significant gender disparity. The predominant histology was urothelial cell carcinoma in both cohorts. Genomic analysis revealed no significant difference between the top mutated genes in the two cohorts, specifically looking into DNA damage repair genes. Molecular subtyping indicated a higher frequency of neuroendocrine differentiation in the CoPPO cohort. 13% of patients in the CoPPO cohort received targeted therapy based on genomic findings, and 16% received non-targeted treatment, totaling 29% receiving CoPPO treatment (9 patients). The remaining 71% received best supportive care. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a non-significant survival benefit for the intervention group in the CoPPO cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      When focusing on 523 highly relevant cancer genes, the mutational profile of mUTC patients who have undergone numerous treatment lines resembles that of newly diagnosed MIBC. These alterations can be targeted, indicating the potential advantage of early genomic testing for personalized treatment within clinical trials."

            "abstract": "Traffic-related nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been traditionally estimated using surfaces generated through land-use regression (LUR). Recently, air pollution dispersion has been used to derive NO2 exposures in urban areas. There is evidence that data collection protocols and modelling assumptions can have a large effect on the resulting NO2 spatial distribution. This study investigates the effects of various NO2 surfaces on the risk estimates of postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC), both of which have already been associated with traffic-related air pollution. We derived exposures for individuals in two case control studies in Montreal, Canada using four different surfaces for NO2. Two of the surfaces were developed using LUR but employed different data collection protocols (LUR-1 and LUR-2), and the other two surfaces were generated using dispersion modelling; one with a regional model (dispersion-1) and another with a street canyon model (dispersion-2). Also, we estimated separate odds ratios (ORs) using concentrations of NO2 as measures of exposure for both cancers. While the range of NO2 concentrations from dispersion (4–26 ppb) was lower than the range from LUR (4–36 ppb), the four surfaces were found to be moderately correlated, with Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from 0.76 to 0.88. The ORs for BC were estimated to be 1.26, 1.10, 1.07, and 1.05 based on LUR-1, LUR-2, dispersion-1, and dispersion-2. In contrast, the ORs for PC were estimated to be 1.39, 1.30, 1.13, and 1.04 based on LUR-1, LUR-2, dispersion-1, and dispersion-2. The four exposure measures indicated positive associations but we observed higher mean ORs based on the LUR surfaces albeit with overlapping CIs. Since LUR models capture all sources of NO2 and dispersion models only capture traffic emissions, it is possible that this difference is due to the fact that non-road sources also contribute to the spatial distribution in NO2 concentrations."

            "abstract": "African American (AA) men have the highest incidence and mortality rate from Prostate cancer (PCa) than any other racial/ethnic group. To date, PCa genomic studies have largely under-represented tumour samples from AA men. We measured genome-wide DNA methylation in benign and tumor prostate tissues from AA men using the Illumina Infunium 850 K EPIC array. mRNA expression database from a subset of the AA biospecimen were used to assess correlation of transcriptome and methylation datasets. Genome-wide methylation analysis identified 11,460 probes that were significant (p < 0.01) and differentially methylated in AA PCa compared to normal prostate tissues and showed significant (p < 0.01) inverse-correlation with mRNA expression. Ingenuity pathway analysis and Gene Ontology analysis in our AA dataset compared with TCGA dataset showed similarities in methylation patterns: top candidate genes with significant hypermethylation and corresponding down-regulated gene expression were associated with biological pathways in hemidesmosome assembly, mammary gland development, epidermis development, hormone biosynthesis, and cell communication. In addition, top candidate genes with significant hypomethylation and corresponding up-regulated gene expression were associated with biological pathways in macrophage differentiation, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, protein destabilization, transcription co-repression, and fatty acid biosynthesis. In contrast, differences in genome-wide methylation in our AA dataset compared with TCGA dataset were enriched for genes in steroid signalling, immune signalling, chromatin structure remodelling and RNA processing. Overall, differential methylation of AMIGO3, IER3, UPB1, GRM7, TFAP2C, TOX2, PLSCR2, ZNF292, ESR2, MIXL1, BOLL, and FGF6 were significant and uniquely associated with PCa progression in our AA cohort."

Agonistic anti-GITR antibodies have anti-tumor activity in cancer mouse models, and recent phase 1 trials have demonstrated their safe pharmacological profile. However, there is limited knowledge on the relationship between GITR expression and the tumor microenvironment. GITR protein expression was assayed by immunohistochemistry on 3992 breast cancer surgical excision specimens assembled into tissue microarrays and scored visually by a pathologist for GITR expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and on carcinoma cells. GITR expression by the malignant cells was further surveyed in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (N = 713), lung carcinoma (N = 705), pancreatic cancer (N = 486), ovarian cancer (N = 445), bladder cancer (N = 88), prostate cancer (N = 88), testicular cancer (N = 76), melanoma (N = 75), renal cell carcinoma (N = 68), epithelioid sarcoma (N = 53), and neuroendocrine tumors (N = 41). In breast cancer, GITR expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (12.4%) correlated with other immune response biomarkers (PD-L1+ on tumor cells, and PD-1+, LAG-3+, TIM-3+ lymphocytes; p < 0.001), and T-cell markers (CD8+, FOXP3+; p < 0.001). GITR+ carcinoma cells were observed in 6.0% of breast cancer cases and correlated with worse relapse-free survival (p = 0.015). Among the additional tumor types examined, cancers with GITR+ malignant cells included bladder cancer (5.7%), primary (but not metastatic) melanoma (4.5%), and ovarian cancer (3.2%); no expression was identified among examined sarcomas. To our knowledge, this is the first immunohistochemistry study to report the frequency and pattern of GITR expression in a large breast cancer cohort, or to report membranous GITR expression on malignant cells. The co-infiltration of GITR with other immune biomarkers and T-cell markers supports a potential role for anti-GITR agents in combination immunotherapies. In addition, GITR expression on carcinoma cells could imply the existence of a novel cancer immune evasion strategy worthy of further investigation."

Dietary recommendations for the prevention and/or management of cardiovascular disease for these individuals are lacking. This review synthesizes the evidence on the effect of dietary interventions on cardiometabolic biomarkers and cardiovascular disease risk in prostate cancer survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy. A systematic review was conducted across PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL. Intervention or observational cohort studies evaluating diets, nutrients, or nutraceuticals with or without concurrent exercise interventions on cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular events, or cardiovascular disease biomarkers in those treated with androgen deprivation therapy were included. Confidence in the body of evidence was appraised using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. Twelve studies reported across fifteen papers were included. Interventions were heterogenous, with most studies including an exercise co-intervention (n = 8). Few significant findings for the effects of diet on cardiometabolic markers were likely due to weak methodology and sample sizes. Strongest evidence was for the effect of a healthy Western dietary pattern with exercise on improved blood pressure (Confidence: moderate). The healthy Western dietary pattern with exercise may improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Confidence: Low) and flow-mediated dilation. Soy may improve total cholesterol (Confidence: Very low). A low-carbohydrate diet with physical activity may improve high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, incidence of metabolic syndrome, and Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score. Evidence of the effect of dietary interventions on cardiometabolic biomarkers and cardiovascular disease risk of prostate cancer survivors receiving androgen deprivation therapy is insufficient to inform practice. Well-designed dietary interventions aimed at improving cardiometabolic outcomes of this population are warranted to inform future dietary recommendations."

The aim of this study was to examine the clinical significance of tumor B7-H3 expression in UTUC.

This approach lacks sensitivity and specificity and is associated with many negative biopsies, high rate of diagnosing clinically insignificant disease and lacks accuracy to predict clinically significant (CS) cancer. The addition of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) before prostate biopsy reduces the detection of low-grade tumors while improving the detection of CS CaP. Most studies that evaluated mpMRI performance did not separate the DRE status of the examined patients. Therefore, the aim of our study is to investigate whether mpMRI provides similar advantages in detection of CaP according to the DRE findings.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      This prospective study included patients with clinically suspected CaP that were referred to MRI-fusion biopsy from 2014 to 2019.

Patients were divided into two groups according to the DRE findings (positive or negative DRE) and the primary outcomes were compared between the 2 study groups: detection rate of CaP and the detection rate of CS disease defined as Gleason score ≥ 7.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The final study cohort included 86 patients: 47 with negative DRE and 39 with positive DRE.

In the region of interest a higher overall detection rate and of CS disease was found in those with abnormal DRE (51.3% vs. 40.4% and 48.6% vs. 34.0% respectively). The systematic biopsy analysis showed an overall lower detection rate in the negative DRE group (8.5% vs. 18.9 %).

            "abstract": "Testicular seminoma is a relatively rare tumor which is mostly detected in male population aged from 15 to 35 years old. Although several molecular biomarkers have been identified to be associated with testicular seminoma pathogenesis, the exact mechanism for testicular seminoma progression remains largely unknown. CDKN2A interacting protein (CDKN2AIP) has previously been identified as a tumor suppressor in multiple malignant diseases. In this study, we aimed to further explore its role in testicular seminoma as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. Retrospective testicular seminoma clinical samples, normal tissues, NTERA-2 cell line, and mouse xenograft models were used in this study. RT-qPCR, western blot analysis, immunofluorescence microscopy, Co-IP and IP-MS experiments were performed to detect the expression of CDKN2AIP and its interaction with CARM1 and eIF4β. SA-β-gal staining assay and H3K9me3 activity experiments were used to subsequently evaluate the cell senescence and apoptosis. Mouse xenograft animal model was used for in vivo study. The results showed that CDKN2AIP is highly expressed in normal testis samples, and is significantly suppressed in testicular seminoma clinical samples and cell line model. Up-regulation of CDKN2AIP is significantly associated with the inhibition of testicular seminoma tumor growth and the increase of cell senescence and apoptosis. CDKN2AIP exhibits anti-tumor activity by interacting with CARM1 and eIF4β. CDKN2AIP induces testicular seminoma cell senescence by suppressing CARM1 expression and eIF4β phosphorylation. The CDKN2AIP-CARM1 and CDKN2AIP-eIF4β interactions, which induce tumor cell senescence and apoptosis, may be the potential druggable molecular pathways in testicular seminoma tumor pathogenesis and progression."

However, the functional role of iCAFs in BCa has been poorly studied. In our study, two BCa scRNA-seq datasets (GSE130001 and GSE146137) were obtained and integrated by the Seurat pipeline. Based on reported markers (COL1A1 and PDGFRA), iCAFs were identified and the related signature of 278 markers was developed. Following unsupervised consensus clustering, two molecular subtypes of TCGA-BLCA were identified and characterized by distinct dysregulated cancer hallmarks, immunological tumor microenvironments, prognoses, responses to chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and stemness. Subsequently, the robustness of the signature-based clustering, in terms of prognosis and therapeutic response prediction, was validated in a GEO-meta cohort with seven independent GEO datasets of 519 BCa patients, and three immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-treated cohorts. Considering the heterogeneity, re-clustering of iCAFs was performed and a subpopulation, named \"LOXL2+ iCAFs\", was identified. Co-culture CM derived from LOXL2 overexpression/silencing CAFs with T24 cells revealed that overexpression of LOXL2 in CAFs promoted while silencing LOXL2 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of T24 cells through IL32. Moreover, the positive correlation between LOXL2 and CD206, an M2 macrophage polarization marker, has been observed and validated. Collectively, integrated single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed an iCAF-related signature that can predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy for BCa.

            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVES\nThere is a paucity of information on environmental risk factors for prostate cancer. We conducted a case-control study in Montreal to estimate associations with exposure to ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker for traffic-related air pollution.\n## METHODS\nCases were 803 men with incident prostate cancer, ≤75 years of age, and diagnosed across all French hospitals in Montreal. Concurrently, 969 controls were drawn from electoral lists of French-speaking individuals residing in the same electoral districts as the cases and frequency-matched by age. Concentrations of NO2 were measured across Montreal in 2005-2006. We developed a land use regression model to predict concentrations of NO2 across Montreal for 2006. These estimates were back-extrapolated to 1996. Estimates were linked to residential addresses at the time of diagnosis or interview. Unconditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nFor each increase of 5 parts per billion of NO2, as estimated from the original land use regression model in 2006, the OR5ppb adjusted for personal factors was 1.44 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). Adding in contextual factors attenuated the OR5ppb to 1.27 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.58). One method for back-extrapolating concentrations of NO2 to 1996 (about 10 years before the index date) gave the following OR5ppb: 1.41 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.62) when personal factors were included, and 1.30 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.52) when contextual factors were added.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nExposure to ambient concentrations of NO2 at the current address was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. This novel finding requires replication.\n"

Multivariable regression models assessed the relationship between surgical technique and surgical margins, warm ischemia time, postoperative complications, and acute kidney injury (AKI). The probability of achieving a modified trifecta (negative margins, warm ischemia time <25min, and no Clavien-Dindo ≥2 complications) was examined for each surgical approach.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Minimally invasive techniques had lower rate of Clavien-Dindo ≥2 complications than that of open surgery (odds ratio [OR] for robotic surgery: 0.27; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.15-0.47, p< 0.0001; OR for laparoscopy: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34-0.78; p= 0.002).

The study population consisted of two independent cohorts of men treated by radical prostatectomy for localized PCA (discovery n = 218 and validation n = 129). Patterns of association between SPINK1 and each of ERG and PTEN were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Associations between SPINK1 expression and various pathologic parameters and clinical outcome were also investigated. SPINK1 was expressed in 15.3 % and 10.9 % of cases in the discovery and validation cohort, respectively. SPINK expression was observed in 5.56 % of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and 1.1 % of adjacent morphologically benign prostatic glands. SPINK1 and ERG expression were almost exclusive, with only 1.0 % of the cases co-expressing both in the same core sample. SPINK1 interfocal and within-core heterogeneity was noted in 29.2 % and 64.6 % of cases, respectively. SPINK1 expression was not significantly associated with PTEN deletion in the two cohorts (p = 0.871 for discovery cohort and p = 0.293 for validation cohort). While SPINK1 expression did occur with hemizygous PTEN deletion, there was a complete absence of SPINK1 expression in PCA showing homozygous PTEN deletion, which was confirmed in the validation cohort (p = 0.02). Despite SPINK1's association with higher Gleason score (>7) (p = 0.02), it was not associated with other pathological parameters or biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy.

In this study, we included all genomic alteration events that led to a loss of protein function of MTAP and CDKN2A, and enrolled 5,307 RCC patients with genomic sequencing data from Western and Chinese cohorts. Notably, MTAP/CDKN2AMUT occurred in the Chinese population ~2 times more frequently than in the Western cohort and showed significant co-mutation trends. We found significantly higher proportions of sarcomatoid-positive patients with MTAPMUT or CDKN2AMUT compared with MTAP/CDKN2A wild-type (WT) patients (P < 0.001). Of the 574 RCC samples from the FUSCC cohort and 3,563 RCC samples from 17 independent cohorts, the MTAP/CDKN2AMUT significantly predicted extremely poor outcomes (P < 0.0001). The Western cohort suggested a concordant relationship between MTAP/CDKN2AMUT and sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC. Moreover, although MTAP/CDKN2AMUT RCC may be insensitive to targeted therapy, the high degree of tumor heterogeneity and higher PD-L1 and CXCL13 expression characterizations reflected that MTAP/CDKN2A-deficient features could benefit from immunotherapy for patients with RCC. This study utilized RCC samples from large-scale, global, multicenter sequencing cohorts and first proved that MTAP/CDKN2A deficiency significantly correlates with sarcomatoid differentiation in RCC and predicts aggressive progression, poor prognosis, and primary resistance to targeted therapy and potential favorable responses to immune checkpoint blockade. Unlike conventional targeted therapies, emerging drugs such as immunotherapies or synthetic lethal PRMT5 inhibitors may become novel therapeutic options for patients with MTAP/CDKN2AMUT RCC."

We calculated discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility of the 4Kscore with and without this coefficient for Black race in our primary analysis cohort of 205 Black men undergoing biopsy for PCa in a Veterans Affairs (VA) institution. We performed a sensitivity analysis using a combined cohort from the US prospective validation and the VA studies.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean probability of high-grade PCa from the 4Kscore in the primary cohort increased from 25% to 37% with race coefficient addition. Incorporating the race coefficient improved 4Kscore's calibration in Black men, with consequent improvements in clinical utility based on decision curve analysis. Model discrimination was maintained (AUC 0.825 vs 0.828, P = .14) in the combined cohort of Black and non-Black men from the US prospective and VA studies and the calibration remained largely unchanged.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Incorporating a prespecified coefficient for Black race improved calibration and clinical utility of the 4Kscore among Black men and should be added to the 4Kscore."

Multiparameter MRI sequences included: T1WI, T2WI, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. The radiomics features of intratumoral and peritumoral regions were extracted simultaneously. Max-Relevance and Min-Redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms were employed to select the features. Six machine learning-based classifiers were adopted to construct the radiomics models, and the best was chosen for the model construction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mRMR and LASSO algorithms were more suitable for Ki67 and histological grade, respectively. Additionally, Ki67 had a higher proportion of intratumoral features, while peritumoral features accounted for a greater proportion of the histological grade. Random forests performed the best in predicting both pathological outcomes. Consequently, the multiparameter MRI (MP-MRI) models achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.977 and 0.852 for Ki67 in training and test sets, respectively, and 0.972 and 0.710 for the histological grade.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Radiomics holds the potential to predict multiple pathological outcomes of bladder cancer preoperatively and are expected to provide clinical decision-making guidance.

However, it has been reported that the use of ADT is significantly associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) among patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic PCa. We investigated changes in renal function that occurred in Japanese patients with PCa after ADT was discontinued.\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Among 121 patients who underwent prostate biopsies, were pathologically diagnosed with PCa, and received ADT for ≥6 months at our Institution between 2009 and 2014, 60 patients who underwent radiotherapy for stage B or C PCa were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. Renal function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the initiation of ADT and the rate of change in the eGFR (ΔeGFR) during ADT and after the discontinuation of ADT was investigated. We divided patients into two groups: Group 1 received ADT for 6 months, and group 2 received ADT for 12 months. Age; ΔeGFR; prostate-specific antigen, testosterone and hemoglobin levels; clinical stage; Gleason score; comorbidities; body mass index; heart rate; and the cardiothoracic ratio were analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 60 patients (group 1: n=23, group 2: n=37) were analyzed.

We classified the participants into those with none, 1, or 2 or more types of hazardous operation experience, based on information of special medical examinations taken, mandatory in Japan for workers engaged in hazardous operations. Using those with no experience as the reference group, we estimated the odds ratios for cancer incidence (all sites, lung, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, bile duct, and bladder) by conditional logistic regression with multiple imputations. We also examined the effects of the combination with hazardous operations and lifestyle-related factors. We observed increased risks for cancer of all sites, and lung, pancreas, and bladder cancer associated with the experience of hazardous operations. Multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of cancer incidence of all sites were 1 (reference), 1.16 (1.12, 1.21), and 1.17 (1.08, 1.27) for none, 1, and 2 or more types of hazardous operation experience, respectively (P for trend <.001). Potential combined associations of hazardous operations with smoking were observed for lung, pancreas, and bladder cancer, and with diabetes for pancreas cancer.

For comparison, a similar inquiry of the \"Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program\" (SEER-18) database for the USA was conducted.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      From 2011 to 2015, a total of 154 and 152 cases of UrC were reported for Germany (RKI) and the USA (SEER-18 area), respectively. Age-standardized incidence was 0.32/1,000,000 age-standardized cases/year in both cohorts, and elderly persons were more often affected. The major histological type was adenocarcinoma (64.9 and 81.6%). Relative 5-year survival was 54.8% (CI: 45.0-64.6) in Germany (RKI) and 64.4% (54.1-72.1) in the USA (SEER-18 cohort). Discusssion/Conclusion: The collected data demonstrate low incidence rates and similar epidemiological and clinicopathological characteristics of UrC for both registries. This is the first report of structured epidemiological data for UrC for the German population."

We examined the impact of these advanced radiotherapy techniques and dose intensification on the toxicity of SRT. This multi-institutional retrospective study included 421 patients who underwent SRT at the median dose of 66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions. IMRT and IGRT were used for 225 (53%) and 321 (76%) patients, respectively. At the median follow-up of 50 months, the cumulative incidence of late grade 2 or higher gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities was 4.8% and 24%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that the non-use of either IMRT or IGRT, or both (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-5.4, p < 0.001) and use of whole-pelvic radiotherapy (HR 7.6, CI 1.0-56, p = 0.048) were associated with late GI toxicity, whereas a higher dose ≥68 Gy was the only factor associated with GU toxicities (HR 3.1, CI 1.3-7.4, p = 0.012). This study suggested that the incidence of GI toxicities can be reduced by IMRT and IGRT in SRT, whereas dose intensification may increase GU toxicity even with these advanced techniques."

Although some modifiable factors have been identified as the risk factors for PCa, the effect of lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids intake (N-6/N-3) remains unknown. Previous studies of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) reported a significant positive association between PCa and selected organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including terbufos and fonofos.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between N-6/N-3 and PCa and any interaction between N-6/N-3 and 2 selected OPs (i.e., terbufos and fonofos) exposure.\n    \n\n\n          Design and participants:\n        \n      \n      This case-control study, nested within a prospective cohort study, was conducted on a subgroup of the AHS population (1193 PCa cases and 14,872 controls) who returned their dietary questionnaire between 1999 and 2003 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PCa was coded based on the International Classification of Diseases of Oncology (ICD-O-3) definitions and obtained from the statewide cancer registries of Iowa (2003-2017) and North Carolina (2003-2014).\n    \n\n\n          Statistical analysis:\n        \n      \n      Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain the odds ratios adjusted (aORs) for age at dietary assessment (years), race/ethnicity (white, African American, other), physical activity (hours/week), smoking (yes/no), terbufos (yes/no), fonofos (yes/no), diabetes, lycopene intake (milligrams/day), family history of PCa, and the interaction of N-6/N-3 with age, terbufos and fonofos. Pesticide exposure was assessed by self-administrated questionnaires collecting data on ever/never use of mentioned pesticides during lifetime as a yes/no variable. Assessing the P value for the interaction between pesticides and N-6/N-3, we used the continuous variable of \"intensity adjusted cumulative exposure\" to terbufos and fonofos. This exposure score was based on duration, intensity and frequency of exposure. We also conducted a stratified regression analysis by quartiles of age.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Relative to the highest N-6/N-3 quartile, the lowest quartile was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa (aOR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.90), and quartile-specific aORs decreased toward the lowest quartile (Ptrend=<0.01). Based on the age-stratified analysis, the protective effect was only significant for the lowest quartile of N-6/N-3 among those aged between 48 and 55 years old (aORs=0.97, 95% CI, 0.45-0.55).

In univariate analyses HER2 IHC positivity, TOP2A amplification, and polysomy 17 were associated with poor clinical outcome after surgery. HER2 IHC overexpression and TOP2A amplification are associated with features of biologically aggressive UTUC. Overexpression and/or amplification of HER2 and TOP2A could help identify patients who may benefit from targeted therapy."

MutDNA was detected in 35.3%, 47.1% and 52.9% of pre-NAC plasma, UCP and USN samples respectively, and urine samples contained higher levels of mutDNA (p = <0.001). Longitudinal mutDNA demonstrated tumour evolution under the selective pressure of NAC e.g. in one case, urine analysis tracked two distinct clones with contrasting treatment sensitivity. Of note, persistence of mutDNA detection during NAC predicted disease recurrence (p = 0.003), emphasising its potential as an early biomarker for chemotherapy response."

            "abstract": "The aim of this evaluation was to identify the first indicators of efficacy for 225Ac-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 therapy in a retrospectively analyzed group of patients. Methods: Forty patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were selected for treatment with three 100 kBq/kg cycles of 225Ac-PSMA-617 at 2-mo intervals. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and blood cell count were measured every 4 wk. PSMA PET/CT or PSMA SPECT/CT were used for baseline staging and imaging follow-up at month 6. Follow-up included the duration of PSA response and radiologic progression-free survival at month 6. Patient histories were reviewed for the duration of previous treatment lines, and a swimmer plot was used to intraindividually compare the duration of tumor control by PSMA therapy versus prior treatment modalities. Results: Thirty-one of 40 patients were treated per protocol. Five patients discontinued treatment because of nonresponse, and 4 because of xerostomia. Of the 38 patients surviving at least 8 wk, 24 (63%) had a PSA decline of more than 50%, and 33 (87%) had a PSA response of any degree. The median duration of tumor control under 225Ac-PSMA-617 last-line therapy was 9.0 mo; 5 patients had an enduring response of more than 2 y. Because all patients had advanced disease, this result compares favorably with the tumor control rates associated with earlier-phase disease; the most common preceding first-, second-, third-, and fourth-line therapies were abiraterone (median duration 10.0 mo), docetaxel (6.5 mo), enzalutamide (6.5 mo), and cabazitaxel (6.0 mo), respectively. Conclusion: A positive response for surrogate parameters demonstrates remarkable antitumor activity for 225Ac-PSMA-617. Swimmer-plot analysis indicates a promising duration of tumor control, especially considering the unfavorable prognostic profile of the selected advanced-stage patients. Xerostomia was the main reason patients discontinued therapy or refused additional administrations and was in the same dimension as nonresponse; this finding indicates that further modifications of the treatment regimen with regard to side effects might be necessary to further enhance the therapeutic range."

It is not known whether cabozantinib-induced adverse events are predictive factors of survival as in case of drugs such as sunitinib or axitinib. The study participants were 30 adult patients with mRCC treated with cabozantinib as a second- or further line setting. All adverse events were evaluated using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Progression-free survival (PFS) values were calculated by taking the beginning of cabozantinib treatment as the start date and either disease progression or death as the end date. PFS were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and compared using the log-rank test. We identified independent PFS predictors using multiple Cox proportional hazards models and reported hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals. The median observation time cabozantinib treatment was 7.5 months, with a range of 2-15 months. During that time, 11 (37%) of the patients had mRCC progression. Median PFS on cabozantinib was not reached, and lower quartile was 6 months. All patients developed at least one adverse event in the course of cabozantinib therapy. Hypertension, hypothyroidism and HFS were observed most frequently, in about two-thirds of the patients. The co-incidence of multiple adverse events was common. Hypertension, hypothyroidism, diarrhea and liver toxicity were significantly associated with longer PFS values. Patients with three or more side effects had significantly longer PFS than those with two or fewer. Even though this study was conducted in a small patient sample and the observation time was relatively short our results confirm the predictive value of the incidence of adverse events during cabozantinib treatment in mRCC patients.

The main objectives were to estimate the proportion of patients who achieved an objective response, time to treatment failure, and overall survival after treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Of 112 identified patients with non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma treated at the participating centres, 66 (59%) had papillary histology, 17 (15%) had Xp11.2 translocation histology, 15 (13%) had unclassified histology, ten (9%) had chromophobe histology, and four (4%) had collecting duct histology. The proportion of patients who achieved an objective response across all histologies was 30 (27%, 95% CI 19-36) of 112 patients. At a median follow-up of 11 months (IQR 6-18), median time to treatment failure was 6·7 months (95% CI 5·5-8·6), median progression-free survival was 7·0 months (5·7-9·0), and median overall survival was 12·0 months (9·2-17·0). The most common adverse events of any grade were fatigue (58 [52%]), and diarrhoea (38 [34%]). The most common grade 3 events were skin toxicity (rash and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia; five [4%]) and hypertension (four [4%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed. Across 54 patients with available next-generation sequencing data, the most frequently altered somatic genes were CDKN2A (12 [22%]) and MET (11 [20%]) with responses seen irrespective of mutational status.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      While we await results from prospective studies, this real-world study provides evidence supporting the antitumour activity and safety of cabozantinib across non-clear-cell renal cell carcinomas. Continued support of international collaborations and prospective ongoing studies targeting non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma subtypes and specific molecular alterations are warranted to improve outcomes across these rare diseases with few evidence-based treatment options.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      None."

Histogram, texture, and combined histogram and texture feature sets were used to train and test three classification algorithms (support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and histogram-based gradient boosting decision tree (HGBDT)) with stratified shuffle splits and threefold cross-validation; AUCs were calculated for each algorithm in each phase to assess prediction of histologic grade and type of pRCCs.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Individual histogram and texture features did not have statistically significant differences between low- and high-grade or type 1 and type 2 pRCCs across all phases. Individual features had low predictive power for tumor grade or type in all phases (AUC < 0.70). HGBDT was highly accurate at predicting pRCC histologic grade and type using histogram, texture or combined histogram and texture feature data from the CM phase (AUCs = 0.97-1.0). All algorithms had highest AUCs using CM phase feature data sets; AUCs decreased using feature sets from NC or NG phases.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The histologic grade and type of small pRCCs can be predicted with classification algorithms using CM histogram and texture features, which outperform NC and NG phase image data. The accurate prediction of pRCC histologic grade and type may be able to further guide management of patients with small (< 4 cm) pRCCs being considered for active surveillance."

Baseline Cu avidity was measured by 64 CuCl2 PET scan. Intravenous (IV) CuCl2 was given weekly for three doses with oral daily DSF followed by daily oral Cu gluconate and DSF until disease progression.

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.The initial STOMP and ORIOLE trial reports suggested that metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) in oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (omCSPC) was associated with improved treatment outcomes. Here, we present long-term outcomes of MDT in omCSPC by pooling STOMP and ORIOLE and assess the ability of a high-risk mutational signature to risk stratify outcomes after MDT. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. High-risk mutations were defined as pathogenic somatic mutations within ATM, BRCA1/2, Rb1, or TP53. The median follow-up for the whole group was 52.5 months. Median PFS was prolonged with MDT compared with observation (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.66; P value < .001), with the largest benefit of MDT in patients with a high-risk mutation (HR high-risk, 0.05; HR no high-risk, 0.42; P value for interaction: .12). Within the MDT cohort, the PFS was 13.4 months in those without a high-risk mutation, compared with 7.5 months in those with a high-risk mutation (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.11; P = .09). Long-term outcomes from the only two randomized trials in omCSPC suggest a sustained clinical benefit to MDT over observation.

We aimed to estimate the absorbed doses for normal organs and tumor lesions using 177Lu-PSMA I&T (I&T is imaging and therapy) in patients undergoing up to 4 cycles of radioligand therapy. Results were compared with pretherapeutic Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[68Ga(HBEDCC)] (68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) PET. Methods: A total of 34 cycles in 18 patients were analyzed retrospectively. In 15 patients the first, in 9 the second, in 5 the third, and in 5 the fourth cycle was analyzed, respectively. Whole-body scintigraphy was performed at least between 30-120 min, 24 h, and 6-8 d after administration. Regions of interest covering the whole body, organs, and up to 4 tumor lesions were drawn. Organ and tumor masses were derived from pretherapeutic 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT. Absorbed doses for individual cycles were calculated using OLINDA/EXM. SUVs from pretherapeutic PET were compared with absorbed doses and with change of SUV. Results: The mean whole-body effective dose for all cycles was 0.06 ± 0.03 Sv/GBq. The mean absorbed organ doses were 0.72 ± 0.21 Gy/GBq for the kidneys; 0.12 ± 0.06 Gy/GBq for the liver; and 0.55 ± 0.14 Gy/GBq for the parotid, 0.64 ± 0.40 Gy/GBq for the submandibular, and 3.8 ± 1.4 Gy/GBq for the lacrimal glands. Absorbed organ doses were relatively constant among the 4 different cycles. Tumor lesions received a mean absorbed dose per cycle of 3.2 ± 2.6 Gy/GBq (range, 0.22-12 Gy/GBq). Doses to tumor lesions gradually decreased, with 3.5 ± 2.9 Gy/GBq for the first, 3.3 ± 2.5 Gy/GBq for the second, 2.7 ± 2.3 Gy/GBq for the third, and 2.4 ± 2.2 Gy/GBq for the fourth cycle. SUVs of pretherapeutic PET moderately correlated with absorbed dose (r = 0.44, P < 0.001 for SUVmax; r = 0.43, P < 0.001 for SUVmean) and moderately correlated with the change of SUV (r = 0.478, P < 0.001 for SUVmax, and r = 0.50, P < 0.001 for SUVmean). Conclusion: Organ- and tumor-absorbed doses for 177Lu-PSMA I&T are comparable to recent reports and complement these with information on an excellent correlation between the 4 therapy cycles. With the kidneys representing the critical organ, a cumulative activity of 40 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA I&T appears to be safe and justifiable. The correlation between pretherapeutic SUV and absorbed tumor dose emphasizes the need for PSMA-ligand PET imaging for patient selection."

GCNIS/GCT and GCT-free survival by age of gonadal surgery, RFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with groups compared using log-rank testing.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      386 articles from 1951 to 2017 were included (2037 patients). Median age at gonadal surgery was 17 years (y) (IQR 11-20), median follow-up was 60 months (m) (IQR 30-68.1). GCNIS/GCT- and GCT-free survival at the time of gonadal surgery was lowest for those in the high/intermediate risk group (p < 0.001) but decreased sharply around age 15y, regardless of risk category. 5y RFS and OS was similar for those with no GCNIS/GCT and GCNIS and was worse for those with GCT (p < 0.001).\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      When patients undergo gonadal surgery, regardless of indication (i.e. prophylactic vs. tumor), it appears that GCTs are more commonly found when surgery is done around age 15 y or older, despite risk category. This is similar to ovarian and testicular GCTs. Patients with GCNIS can be reassured that long-term oncologic outcomes are excellent. While RFS and OS for GCTs are not as good as for ovarian and testicular GCTs (95%), they are still >80%. This similar trend was found in a COG review of 9 patients with DSD and ovarian GCT. There were several limitations to this study. This is a retrospective analysis that included aa wide time frame of publications. The indication for surgical intervention was not addressed in the majority of publications. Thus these data provide pathologic outcomes based on age at gonadal surgery rather than the age at which GCNIS/GCT develops over a lifetime, if at all.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The risk of GCNIS or GCT at the time of gonadal surgery appears to increase with age, accelerating between 15 and 20y regardless of risk category. 5y RFS and OS for those with GCNIS is equivalent to those without GCNIS/GCT but is worse for those with GCT. These data may be used when counseling families on timing of gonadal surgery and quantification of outcomes should GCNIS or malignancy be identified."

Here, we report the results of health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) analyses from the KEYNOTE-045 trial. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or investigator's choice of docetaxel 75 mg/m2, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2, or vinflunine 320 mg/m2 administered intravenously every 3 weeks. Key prespecified HRQoL analyses were time to deterioration (TTD) and mean change from baseline to week 15 in European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 global health status/quality-of-life score. Results Of 542 patients who were randomly assigned, 519 were included in HRQoL analyses (pembrolizumab, n = 266; chemotherapy, n = 253). HRQoL compliance was > 95% at baseline and approximately 88% at week 15 for both groups. Pembrolizumab prolonged TTD in global health status/quality-of-life score compared with chemotherapy (median, 3.5 months v 2.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.72; nominal one-sided P = .004). Mean (95% CI) change from baseline to week 15 in global health status/quality-of-life score was 0.69 (-2.40 to 3.77) with pembrolizumab and -8.36 (-11.84 to -4.89) with chemotherapy (mean difference, 9.05 points; 95% CI, 4.61 to 13.50; nominal two-sided P < .001). Conclusion Pembrolizumab prolonged TTD in HRQoL compared with chemotherapy. Patients who were treated with pembrolizumab had stable or improved global health status/quality of life, whereas those who were treated with investigator's choice of chemotherapy experienced declines in global health status/quality of life. Combined with efficacy and safety outcomes, these data support pembrolizumab as standard of care for patients with platinum-refractory advanced urothelial cancer."

However, the relationship between the genetic profiling of MIBC and NAC response remains unclear. Here, a mutation panel of six cancer-associated genes (TSC1, FGFR3, TERT, TP53, PIK3CA and ERBB2) and an immunohistochemistry (IHC) panel containing eight bladder cancer (BC) biomarkers (EGFR, RRM1, PD-L1, BRCA1, TUBB3, ERCC, ERCC1, aberrantly glycosylated integrin α3β1 (AG) and CK5/6) were developed. BC samples from patients who showed a pathologic response (n = 39) and non-response (n = 13) were applied to the panel analysis. ERBB2, FGFR3 and PIK3CA exclusively altered in the responders group (19/39, 48.7%), in which FGFR3 mutations were significantly enriched in patients with a response in the cohort (14/39, 35.9%; P = 0.01). Additionally, strong expression of ERCC1 was associated with a pathologic response (P = 0.01). However, positive lymph node metastasis (P < 0.01) and lymph-vascular invasion (LVI) (P = 0.03) were correlated with a non-response. Overall, the data show that FGFR3 mutations and elevated expression of ERCC1 in MIBCs are potential predictive biomarkers of the response to NAC."

Since this kind of therapy has gained a large momentum in recent years, an upscaled production process yielding multiple patient doses in one batch has been developed. During upscaling, the established production method as well as the HPLC quality control were challenged. A major finding was a correlation between the specific activity and the formation of a pre-peak, presumably caused by radiolysis. Hence, nonradioactive reference standards were irradiated with an X-ray source and the formed pre-peak was subsequently identified as a deiodination product by UPLC-MS. To confirm the occurrence of the same deiodinated side product in the routine batch, a customized deiodinated precursor was radiolabeled and analyzed with the same HPLC setup, revealing an identical retention time to the pre-peak in the formerly synthesized routine batches. Additionally, further cyclization products of [177Lu]Lu-PSMAI&T were identified as major contributors to radiochemical impurities. The comparison of two HPLC methods showed the likelihood of the overestimation of the radiochemical purity during the synthesis of [177Lu]Lu-PSMAI&T.

Manually reviewed records served as the gold standard.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The F1 scores after model training were >0.7 for all but one uncommon feature (prostatic urethral involvement). The highest area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) was observed for Ta (0.897) and T1 (0.897); the lowest AUC was for carcinoma in situ (CIS; 0.617). For high-risk NMIBC classification, positive predictive value was 79.4%, negative predictive value was 93.2%, and false-positive rate was 8.9%. Sensitivity and specificity were 83.7% and 91.1%, respectively. Of 748 patients manually confirmed as having high-risk NMIBC, 196 (26%) had CIS (of whom 19% also had T1 and 23% also had Ta disease); 552 tumors (74%) had no associated CIS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The NLP model, combined with a rule-based algorithm, identified high-risk NMIBC with good performance and will enable future work to study real-world treatment patterns and clinical outcomes for high-risk NMIBC."

            "abstract": "Motivation:\n        \n      \n      One of the standard methods of high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis is differential expression. However, it does not detect changes in molecular regulation. In contrast to the standard differential expression analysis, differential co-expression one aims to detect pairs or clusters whose mutual expression changes between two conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We developed Differential Co-expression Network Analysis (DCoNA)-an open-source statistical tool that allows one to identify pair interactions, which correlation significantly changes between two conditions. Comparing DCoNA with the state-of-the-art analog, we showed that DCoNA is a faster, more accurate and less memory-consuming tool. We applied DCoNA to prostate mRNA/miRNA-seq data collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compared predicted regulatory interactions of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) and their target mRNAs between normal and cancer samples. As a result, almost all highly expressed isomiRs lost negative correlation with their targets in prostate cancer samples compared to ones without the pathology. One exception to this trend was the canonical isomiR of hsa-miR-93-5p acquiring cancer-specific targets. Further analysis showed that cancer aggressiveness simultaneously increased with the expression level of this isomiR in both TCGA primary tumor samples and 153 blood plasma samples of P. Hertsen Moscow Oncology Research Institute patients' cohort analyzed by miRNA microarrays.\n    \n\n\n          Availability and implementation:\n        \n      \n      Source code and documentation of DCoNA are available at https://github.com/zhiyanov/DCoNA.\n    \n\n\n          Supplementary information:\n        \n      \n      Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

Patients and Methods Participants were ≤ 55 years of age at diagnosis, finished first-line chemotherapy ≥ 1 year previously, completed a comprehensive questionnaire, and underwent physical examination. Treatment data were abstracted from medical records. A CBM score encompassed the number and severity of AHOs, with ordinal logistic regression used to assess associations with exposures. Nonlinear factor analysis and the nonparametric dimensionality evaluation to enumerate contributing traits procedure determined which AHOs co-occurred. Results Among 1,214 participants, approximately 20% had a high (15%) or very high/severe (4.1%) CBM score, whereas approximately 80% scored medium (30%) or low/very low (47%). Increased risks of higher scores were associated with four cycles of either ifosfamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (odds ratio [OR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.04 to 3.71) or bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.98), older attained age (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.26), current disability leave (OR, 3.53; 95% CI, 1.57 to 7.95), less than a college education (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.87), and current or former smoking (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.63). CBM score did not differ after either chemotherapy regimen ( P = .36). Asian race (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.72) and vigorous exercise (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.89) were protective. Variable clustering analyses identified six significant AHO clusters (χ2 P < .001): hearing loss/damage, tinnitus (OR, 16.3); hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes (OR, 9.8); neuropathy, pain, Raynaud phenomenon (OR, 5.5); cardiovascular and related conditions (OR, 5.0); thyroid disease, erectile dysfunction (OR, 4.2); and depression/anxiety, hypogonadism (OR, 2.8). Conclusion Factors associated with higher CBM may identify testicular cancer survivors in need of closer monitoring. If confirmed, identified AHO clusters could guide the development of survivorship care strategies."

In this group the prostate specific antigen level at last followup was less than 0.01 ng/ml in 132 patients, 0.01 to 0.03 ng/ml in 27 patients, and 0.06 ng/ml, 0.07 ng/ml and 0.11 ng/ml in 1 patient each.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This long-term review indicates that if patients have continuously undetectable prostate specific antigen levels by an ultrasensitive assay for 5 years, prostate specific antigen monitoring can be stopped with an extremely low risk of subsequent biochemical recurrence."

            "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve an important role in renal cancer, but renal cancer miRNA expression data remains inconsistent. Therefore, there is a requirement for integrated analysis of these data. An increasing number of studies demonstrate that miR‑122 is dysregulated in numerous cancer types, including liver, lung and breast cancer, yet its role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear. In the present study, an integrated analysis of four ccRCC miRNAs expression datasets was performed and the expression of miR‑122 in the present cohort was validated. The effects of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of ccRCC cells in vitro were assayed following transfection with miR‑122 mimics and inhibitor. The target gene of miR‑122 was confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay, and a xenograft mouse model was used to determine the effect of miR‑122 in ccRCC tumorigenicity in vivo. The present results demonstrated that patients with ccRCC with an increased miR‑122 level in tumor tissues had a shortened metastasis‑free survival time as indicated by The Cancer Genome Atlas‑Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma dataset and the present ccRCC cohort. Overexpression of miR‑122 in 786‑O cells improved cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, while knockdown of miR‑122 in SN12‑PM6 cells inhibited cell growth, colony formation, migration and invasion. Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assays were used to identify FOXO3 as a direct target of miR‑122. The present results indicate that miR‑122 serves a tumor‑promoting role by direct targeting FOXO3 in ccRCC."

Our objective was to determine whether non-clinical trial patients adhere to AS protocols and how many are lost to follow-up (LTFU).\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      Retrospective chart review was performed for patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer who initiated AS at Los Angeles County Hospital (LAC) and University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (Norris) between January 1, 2008, and January 1, 2015. Competing-risks regression analyses examined the difference in LTFU rates of AS patients in the 2 institutions and examined the association between LTFU and patient characteristics. We used California Cancer Registry data to verify if patients LTFU were monitored and/or treated at other LAC medical facilities.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      We found 116 patients at LAC and 98 at Norris who met the AS criteria for this study. Patients at LAC and Norris had similar tumor characteristics but differed in median income, race, primary language spoken, distance residing from hospital, and socioeconomic status (SES). LTFU was significantly different between the institutions: 57 ± 7% at LAC and 32 ± 6% at Norris at 5 years (P < .001). By multivariable analysis, the main determinant of LTFU was SES (P = .045).

We studied the associations between residential green spaces and site-specific cancer mortality in urban Belgium.\n    \n\n\n          Methodology:\n        \n      \n      We linked the 2001 Belgian census, register mortality data for 2001-2014, and environmental information (green spaces and air pollution) at baseline residence (2001). We included residents from the largest Belgian urban areas aged ≥ 30 years at baseline. Exposure to residential green spaces was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Urban Atlas, and perceived neighbourhood greenness (from the census). We used Cox proportional hazards models to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) of the mortality risk from lung, colorectal, breast (in women) and prostate cancer (in men) per interquartile range increment in residential green spaces. We further analyzed the role of outdoor air pollution and effect modification by age and socioeconomic position (SEP) in main associations.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      2,441,566 individuals were included at baseline. During follow-up, 1.2 % died from lung cancer, 0.6 % from colorectal cancer, 0.8 % from breast cancer, and 0.6 % from prostate cancer. After adjustment, higher exposure to green spaces was associated with a reduced mortality risk from lung cancer and breast cancer [e.g., for NDVI within 300 m, HR:0.946 (95 %CI:0.924,0.970), and HR:0.927 (95 %CI:0.892,0.963), respectively], but not with colorectal or prostate cancer mortality.

Beneficial effects of greenspace were generally stronger in < 65-year-old, but no clear trend by SEP was found.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that residing in green areas could decrease mortality risk from lung and breast cancer, potentially independent from air pollution.

            "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) treatment has improved in the last decade with the introduction of drugs targeting tumor angiogenesis. However, the 5-year survival of metastatic disease is still only 10-15%. Here, we explored the prognostic significance of compartment-specific expression of Neuropilin 1 (NRP1), a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). NRP1 expression was analyzed in RCC tumor vessels, in perivascular tumor cells, and generally in the tumor cell compartment. Moreover, complex formation between NRP1 and the main VEGF receptor, VEGFR2, was determined. Two RCC tissue microarrays were used; a discovery cohort consisting of 64 patients and a validation cohort of 314 patients. VEGFR2/NRP1 complex formation in cis (on the same cell) and trans (between cells) configurations was determined by in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA), and NRP1 protein expression in three compartments (endothelial cells, perivascular tumor cells, and general tumor cell expression) was determined by immunofluorescent staining. Expression of NRP1 in perivascular tumor cells was explored as a marker for RCC survival in the two RCC cohorts. Results were further validated using a publicly available gene expression dataset of clear cell RCC (ccRCC). We found that VEGFR2/NRP1 trans complexes were detected in 75% of the patient samples. The presence of trans VEGFR2/NRP1 complexes or perivascular NRP1 expression was associated with a reduced tumor vessel density and size. When exploring NRP1 as a biomarker for RCC prognosis, perivascular NRP1 and general tumor cell NRP1 protein expression correlated with improved survival in the two independent cohorts, and significant results were obtained also at the mRNA level using the publicly available ccRCC gene expression dataset. Only perivascular NRP1 expression remained significant in multivariable analysis. Our work shows that perivascular NRP1 expression is an independent marker of improved survival in RCC patients, and reduces tumor vascularization by forming complexes in trans with VEGFR2 in the tumor endothelium. © 2019 The Authors.

We classified patients as with or without de novo metastatic disease (M1 or M0, respectively) at diagnosis and determined the proportion with M1 disease over time. Changes in age-standardized net survival were calculated as the difference in the 1- and 5-year survival rates of patients diagnosed in 1989-1993 and 2014-2018.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Different cancers showed divergent trends in the proportion of M1 disease and increases in net survival for M1 disease (approximately 0-50 percentage points at both 1 and 5 years).

Therefore, in this web-based survey, we aimed to compare the effects of post-treatment changes on the annual income of patients with prostate cancer after undergoing radical radiotherapy and prostatectomy and to identify the risk factors associated with the decrease in annual income. We investigated the clinical characteristics and demographics including pre-treatment working status, self-employment, non-regular employment, working for wage or salary, and joblessness of patients with localized prostate cancer. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the effects of various factors on the change in the annual income of self-employed and non-regularly employed workers. Seventy-eight eligible patients with localized prostate cancer had undergone radiotherapy, and 128 patients had undergone prostatectomy. Among self-employed and non-regularly employed workers, post-treatment income decline rates in those who underwent radiotherapy were smaller but not significant (12% vs. 42%, P = 0.074). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that initial treatment for prostate cancer was the only significant risk factor for the post-treatment income decline among self-employed and non-regularly employed workers. Radiotherapy was associated with a smaller decrease in income (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.052-0.95; P = 0.042).

Retinoic acid-induced 2 (RAI2) protein is thought to act as a transcriptional coregulator involved in hormonal responses and epithelial differentiation. We evaluated the clinical relevance and biological function of the RAI2 protein in prostate cancer.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We assessed RAI2 gene expression in the Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma PanCancer cohort and protein expression in primary tumors (n = 199) by immunohistochemistry. We studied RAI2 gene expression as part of a multimarker panel in an enriched circulating tumor cell population isolated from blood samples (n = 38) of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, we analyzed the consequences of androgen receptor inhibition on RAI2 protein expression and the consequences of RAI2 depletion on the expression of the androgen receptor and selected target genes.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Abundance of the RAI2 protein in adenocarcinomas correlated with the androgen receptor; keratins 8, 18, and 19; and E-cadherin as well as with an early biochemical recurrence. In circulating tumor cells, detection of RAI2 mRNA significantly correlated with gene expression of FOLH1, KLK3, RAI2, AR, and AR-V7. In VCaP and LNCaP cell lines, sustained inhibition of hormone receptor activity induced the RAI2 protein, whereas RAI2 depletion augmented the expression of MME, STEAP4, and WIPI1.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The RAI2 protein functions as a transcriptional coregulator of the androgen response in prostate cancer cells.

            "abstract": "In two earlier case-control studies conducted in Montreal, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker for traffic-related air pollution was found to be associated with the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer and prostate cancer. These studies relied on a land use regression model (LUR) for NO2 that is commonly used in epidemiologic studies for deriving estimates of traffic-related air pollution. Here, we investigate the use of a transportation model developed during the summer season to generate a measure of traffic emissions as an alternative to the LUR model. Our traffic model provides estimates of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the level of individual roads, as does the LUR model. Our main objective was to compare the distribution of the spatial estimates of NOx computed from our transportation model to the distribution obtained from the LUR model. A secondary objective was to compare estimates of risk using these two exposure estimates. We observed that the correlation (spearman) between our two measures of exposure (NO2 and NOx) ranged from less than 0.3 to more than 0.9 across Montreal neighborhoods. The most important factor affecting the \"agreement\" between the two measures in a specific area was found to be the length of roads. Areas affected by a high level of traffic-related air pollution had a far better agreement between the two exposure measures. A comparison of odds ratios (ORs) obtained from NO2 and NOx used in two case-control studies of breast and prostate cancer, showed that the differences between the ORs associated with NO2 exposure vs NOx exposure differed by 5.2-8.8%.\n"

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of the challenging patient position and CO2 insufflation in perineal space during RAPP on both hemodynamic parameters and respiratory mechanics. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters of 30 patients who underwent RAPP and 31 patients who underwent Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) for prostate cancer between 2017 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Comparison between RAPP and RALP patients showed that anesthesia, surgery and insufflation times were shorter in RAPP patients (p < 0.05). Blood pCO2 level was higher, and the pH decrease was more prominent in the RAPP patients 30 and 60 min after perineal CO2 insufflation (p < 0.05). The mean arterial pressures, driving pressure, Ppeak and Pplato values were statistically higher in the RALP patients and 60 min after insufflation while static and dynamic lung compliance values were found to be lower. Our results showed that blood pCO2 level may severely increase after perineal CO2 insufflation. The fact that respiratory mechanics are less affected despite the difficult patient position for lungs in RAPP patients, the presence of higher CO2 level supports that the perineal CO2 insufflation plays a more important role in increased CO2 level. Considering these changes, especially the sudden increase in the risk of CO2 level, close follow-up and timely intervention by anesthesiology can ensure all changes remain in a clinically safe range."

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men, and more than 10% of men will be diagnosed with PCa during their lifetime. Patients that are not cured with surgery or radiation are largely treated with endocrine therapies that target androgens or the androgen receptor (AR), a major driver of PCa. In response to androgen deprivation, most PCas progress to castrate resistant PCa, which is treated with anti-androgens like enzalutamide, but tumors still progress and become incurable. Thus, there is a critical need to identify cellular pathways that allow tumors to escape anti-androgen therapies. Epidemiological studies suggest that high-fat diets play important roles in PCa progression. Lipid metabolism rewires the PCa metabolome to support growth and resistance to endocrine therapies, although the exact mechanisms remain obscure. Therapeutic effects have been observed inhibiting several aspects of PCa lipid metabolism: Synthesis, uptake, and oxidation. Since AR remains a driver of PCa in advanced disease, strategies targeting both lipid metabolism and AR are starting to emerge, providing new opportunities to re-sensitize tumors to endocrine therapies with lipid metabolic approaches."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Bladder cancer (BC) threatens the health of human beings worldwide because of its high recurrence rate and mortality. As an actionable biomarker, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) alterations have been revealed as a vital biomarker and associated with favorable outcomes in BC. However, the comprehensive relationship between the FGFR3 alteration associated gene expression profile and the prognosis of BC remains ambiguous.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Genomic alteration profile, gene expression data, and related clinical information of BC patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genomics database (TCGA), as a training cohort. Subsequently, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify the hub modules correlated with FGFR3 alteration. The univariate, multivariate, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression analyses were used to obtain an FGFR3 alteration-related gene (FARG) prognostic signature and FARG-based nomogram. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used for evaluation of the ability of prognosis prediction. The FARG signature was validated in four independent datasets, namely, GSE13507, GSE31684, GSE32548, and GSE48075, from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Then, clinical feature association analysis, functional enrichment, genomic alteration enrichment, and tumor environment analysis were conducted to reveal differential clinical and molecular characterizations in different risk groups. Lastly, the treatment response was evaluated in the immunotherapy-related dataset of the IMvigor210 cohort and the frontline chemotherapy dataset of GSE48276, and the chemo-drug sensitivity was estimated via Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      There were a total of eleven genes (CERCAM, TPST1, OSBPL10, EMP1, CYTH3, NCRNA00201, PCDH10, GAP43, COLQ, DGKB, and SETBP1) identified in the FARG signature, which divided BC patients from the TCGA cohort into high- and low-risk groups. The Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated that BC patients in the low-risk group have superior overall survival (OS) than those in the high-risk group (median OS: 27.06 months vs. 104.65 months, p < 0.0001). Moreover, the FARG signature not only showed a good performance in prognosis prediction, but also could distinguish patients with different neoplasm disease stages, notably whether patients presented with muscle invasive phenotype. Compared to clinicopathological features, the FARG signature was found to be the only independent prognostic factor, and subsequently, a FARG-based prognostic nomogram was constructed with better ability of prognosis prediction, indicated by area under ROC curve (AUC) values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of 0.69, 0.71, and 0.79, respectively. Underlying the FARG signature, multiple kinds of metabolism- and immune-related signaling pathways were enriched. Genomic alteration enrichment further identified that FGFR3 alterations, especially c.746C>G (p.Ser249Cys), were more prevalent in the low-risk group. Additionally, FARG score was positively correlated with ESTIMATE and TIDE scores, and the low-risk group had abundant enrichment of plasma B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ naive T cells, and helper follicular T cells, implying that patients in the low-risk group were likely to make significant responses to immunotherapy, which was further supported by the analysis in the IMvigor210 cohort as there was a significantly higher response rate among patients with lower FARG scores. The analysis of the GDSC database finally demonstrated that low-risk samples were more sensitive to methotrexate and tipifarnib, whereas those in the high-risk group had higher sensitivities in cisplatin, docetaxel, and paclitaxel, instead.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The novel established FARG signature based on a comprehensive FGFR3 alteration-related transcriptomic profile performed well in prognosis prediction and was also correlated with immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment responses, which had great potential in future clinical applications."

The tumor size and histological subtype were independent risk factors for recurrence.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Complete resection with high inguinal orchiectomy is the optimal treatment for paratesticular liposarcoma."

This study sought to characterize variation in use of the six \"focus drugs\" (docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, sipuleucel-T, radium-223, and cabazitaxel) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer during the years 2010-2015.

            "abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies that block the programmed death-1 (PD-1)-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway can induce robust and durable responses in patients with various cancers, including metastatic urothelial cancer. However, these responses only occur in a subset of patients. Elucidating the determinants of response and resistance is key to improving outcomes and developing new treatment strategies. Here we examined tumours from a large cohort of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer who were treated with an anti-PD-L1 agent (atezolizumab) and identified major determinants of clinical outcome. Response to treatment was associated with CD8+ T-effector cell phenotype and, to an even greater extent, high neoantigen or tumour mutation burden. Lack of response was associated with a signature of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signalling in fibroblasts. This occurred particularly in patients with tumours, which showed exclusion of CD8+ T cells from the tumour parenchyma that were instead found in the fibroblast- and collagen-rich peritumoural stroma; a common phenotype among patients with metastatic urothelial cancer. Using a mouse model that recapitulates this immune-excluded phenotype, we found that therapeutic co-administration of TGFβ-blocking and anti-PD-L1 antibodies reduced TGFβ signalling in stromal cells, facilitated T-cell penetration into the centre of tumours, and provoked vigorous anti-tumour immunity and tumour regression. Integration of these three independent biological features provides the best basis for understanding patient outcome in this setting and suggests that TGFβ shapes the tumour microenvironment to restrain anti-tumour immunity by restricting T-cell infiltration."

To address this proposition, we present an overview of the performance of PRS tools (ie, models and sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms) alongside harms and benefits of PRS-stratified cancer screening for eight example cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, pancreas, ovary, kidney, lung, and testicular cancer).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      For this modelling analysis, we used age-stratified cancer incidences for the UK population from the National Cancer Registration Dataset (2016-18) and published estimates of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for current, future, and optimised PRS for each of the eight cancer types. For each of five PRS-defined high-risk quantiles (ie, the top 50%, 20%, 10%, 5%, and 1%) and according to each of the three PRS tools (ie, current, future, and optimised) for the eight cancers, we calculated the relative proportion of cancers arising, the odds ratios of a cancer arising compared with the UK population average, and the lifetime cancer risk. We examined maximal attainable rates of cancer detection by age stratum from combining PRS-based stratification with cancer screening tools and modelled the maximal impact on cancer-specific survival of hypothetical new UK programmes of PRS-stratified screening.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      The PRS-defined high-risk quintile (20%) of the population was estimated to capture 37% of breast cancer cases, 46% of prostate cancer cases, 34% of colorectal cancer cases, 29% of pancreatic cancer cases, 26% of ovarian cancer cases, 22% of renal cancer cases, 26% of lung cancer cases, and 47% of testicular cancer cases. Extending UK screening programmes to a PRS-defined high-risk quintile including people aged 40-49 years for breast cancer, 50-59 years for colorectal cancer, and 60-69 years for prostate cancer has the potential to avert, respectively, a maximum of 102, 188, and 158 deaths annually. Unstratified screening of the full population aged 48-49 years for breast cancer, 58-59 years for colorectal cancer, and 68-69 years for prostate cancer would use equivalent resources and avert, respectively, an estimated maximum of 80, 155, and 95 deaths annually. These maximal modelled numbers will be substantially attenuated by incomplete population uptake of PRS profiling and cancer screening, interval cancers, non-European ancestry, and other factors.\n    \n\n\n          Interpretation:\n        \n      \n      Under favourable assumptions, our modelling suggests modest potential efficiency gain in cancer case detection and deaths averted for hypothetical new PRS-stratified screening programmes for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. Restriction of screening to high-risk quantiles means many or most incident cancers will arise in those assigned as being low-risk. To quantify real-world clinical impact, costs, and harms, UK-specific cluster-randomised trials are required.\n    \n\n\n          Funding:\n        \n      \n      The Wellcome Trust."

However, patients with KIRC usually have poor prognosis due to limited biomarkers for early detection and prognosis prediction. In this study, we analysed key genes and pathways involved in KIRC from an array dataset including 26 tumour and 26 adjacent normal tissue samples. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed with the WGCNA package, and 20 modules were characterized as having the highest correlation with KIRC. The upregulated genes in the tumour samples are involved in the innate immune response, whereas the downregulated genes contribute to the cellular catabolism of glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. Furthermore, the key genes were evaluated through a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network combined with a co-expression network. The comparatively lower expression of AGXT, PTGER3 and SLC12A3 in tumours correlates with worse prognosis in KIRC patients, while higher expression of ALOX5 predicts reduced survival. Our integrated analysis illustrated the hub genes involved in KIRC tumorigenesis, shedding light on the development of prognostic markers.

Moreover, BCG vaccine has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD), but previous studies have been limited by sample size, study design, or analyses.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate whether intravesical BCG vaccine exposure is associated with a decreased incidence of ADRD in a cohort of patients with NMIBC while accounting for death as a competing event.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      This cohort study was performed in patients aged 50 years or older initially diagnosed with NMIBC between May 28, 1987, and May 6, 2021, treated within the Mass General Brigham health care system. The study included a 15-year follow-up of individuals (BCG vaccine treated or controls) whose condition did not clinically progress to muscle-invasive cancer within 8 weeks and did not have an ADRD diagnosis within the first year after the NMIBC diagnosis. Data analysis was conducted from April 18, 2021, to March 28, 2023.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      The main outcome was time to ADRD onset identified using diagnosis codes and medications. Cause-specific hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index) using inverse probability scores weighting.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In this cohort study including 6467 individuals initially diagnosed with NMIBC between 1987 and 2021, 3388 patients underwent BCG vaccine treatment (mean [SD] age, 69.89 [9.28] years; 2605 [76.9%] men) and 3079 served as controls (mean [SD] age, 70.73 [10.00] years; 2176 [70.7%] men). Treatment with BCG vaccine was associated with a lower rate of ADRD (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99), with an even lower rate of ADRD in patients aged 70 years or older at the time of BCG vaccine treatment (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.60-0.91). In competing risks analysis, BCG vaccine was associated with a lower risk of ADRD (5-year risk difference, -0.011; 95% CI, -0.019 to -0.003) and a decreased risk of death in patients without an earlier diagnosis of ADRD (5-year risk difference, -0.056; 95% CI, -0.075 to -0.037).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      In this study, BCG vaccine was associated with a significantly lower rate and risk of ADRD in a cohort of patients with bladder cancer when accounting for death as a competing event. However, the risk differences varied with time."

            "abstract": "Aside from PD-L1 expression, biomarkers of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are needed. In a previous retrospective analysis, we documented that fecal Akkermansia muciniphila (Akk) was associated with clinical benefit of ICI in patients with NSCLC or kidney cancer. In the current study, we performed shotgun-metagenomics-based microbiome profiling in a large cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC (n = 338) treated with first- or second-line ICIs to prospectively validate the predictive value of fecal Akk. Baseline stool Akk was associated with increased objective response rates and overall survival in multivariate analyses, independent of PD-L1 expression, antibiotics, and performance status. Intestinal Akk was accompanied by a richer commensalism, including Eubacterium hallii and Bifidobacterium adolescentis, and a more inflamed tumor microenvironment in a subset of patients. However, antibiotic use (20% of cases) coincided with a relative dominance of Akk above 4.8% accompanied with the genus Clostridium, both associated with resistance to ICI. Our study shows significant differences in relative abundance of Akk that may represent potential biomarkers to refine patient stratification in future studies."

However, AS may be associated with increased risk of disease progression and metastasis due to delayed therapy. Genomic classifiers, e.g., Decipher, may allow better risk-stratify newly diagnosed prostate cancers for AS.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Decipher was initially assessed in a prospective cohort of prostatectomies to explore the correlation with clinically meaningful biologic characteristics and then assessed in diagnostic biopsies from a retrospective multicenter cohort of 266 men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) very low/low and favorable-intermediate risk prostate cancer. Decipher and Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) were compared as predictors of adverse pathology (AP) for which there is universal agreement that patients with long life-expectancy are not suitable candidates for AS (primary pattern 4 or 5, advanced local stage [pT3b or greater] or lymph node involvement).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Decipher from prostatectomies was significantly associated with adverse pathologic features (p-values < 0.001).

CAPRA area under curve (AUC) was 0.57, (95% CI 0.47-0.68). Adding Decipher to CAPRA increased the AUC to 0.65 (95% CI 0.58-0.70). NPV, which determines the degree of confidence in the absence of AP for patients, was 91% (95% CI 87-94%) and 96% (95% CI 90-99%) for Decipher thresholds of 0.45 and 0.2, respectively. Using a threshold of 0.2, Decipher was a significant predictor of AP when adjusting for CAPRA (p-value 0.016).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Decipher can be applied to prostate biopsies from NCCN-very-low/low and favorable-intermediate risk patients to predict absence of adverse pathologic features.

Only a few studies have been conducted in developing countries or in centers in their initial learning curve that predict the outcomes of RARP. Therefore, this study aimed to present data from a novice center; how we started and progressed, and to compare our results with the rest of the world. This is a retrospective analysis to study the outcomes following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and to identify the predictors of quadrifecta outcomes, i.e., the patients who were continent, did not have complications, were biochemical recurrence free with at least 1 year of follow-up and had negative surgical margins. In our data, we excluded the erectile function as one of the parameters as the majority of our patients were not sexually active or did not want to discuss this parameter. Seventy-two patients were included in this study, and 50 (69.4%) of these achieved the quadrifecta outcomes. Of all the factors, studied, seven factors were statistically significantly different between Group I (quadrifecta achieved) and Group II (quadrifecta not achieved), namely, BMI, co-morbidities like CAD, COPD, ASA grade, pre-op D'Amico risk stratification groups, clinical staging, positive lymph-node status, and hospital stay. With this study, we reported outcomes of RARP in a newly established robotic center and the results were fairly comparable with the well-developed center in India and abroad, emphasizing the short learning curve, and so, the requirement of establishing more robotic surgery centers in developing as well as developed countries."

CBM588 is a bifidogenic live bacterial product that we postulated could augment CPI response through modulation of the gut microbiome. In this open-label, single-center study (NCT03829111), 30 treatment-naive patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma with clear cell and/or sarcomatoid histology and intermediate- or poor-risk disease were randomized 2:1 to receive nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without daily oral CBM588, respectively. Stool metagenomic sequencing was performed at multiple timepoints. The primary endpoint to compare the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. at baseline and at 12 weeks was not met, and no significant differences in Bifidobacterium spp. or Shannon index associated with the addition of CBM588 to nivolumab-ipilimumab were detected. Secondary endpoints included response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity. PFS was significantly longer in patients receiving nivolumab-ipilimumab with CBM588 than without (12.7 months versus 2.5 months, hazard ratio 0.15, 95% confidence interval 0.05-0.47, P = 0.001). Although not statistically significant, the response rate was also higher in patients receiving CBM588 (58% versus 20%, P = 0.06). No significant difference in toxicity was observed between the study arms. The data suggest that CBM588 appears to enhance the clinical outcome in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma treated with nivolumab-ipilimumab.

Emerging studies have suggested that exposure to air pollution is closely relevant to increased risk of CKD, CKD progression and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Inhaled airborne particles may cause vascular injury, intraglomerular hypertension, or glomerulosclerosis through non-hemodynamic and hemodynamic factors with multiple complex interactions. The mechanisms linking air pollutants exposure to CKD include elevated blood pressure, worsening oxidative stress and inflammatory response, DNA damage and abnormal metabolic changes to aggravate kidney damage. In the present review, we will discuss the epidemiologic observations linking air pollutants exposure to the incidence and progression of CKD. Then, we elaborate the potential roles of several air pollutants including particulate matter and gaseous co-pollutants, environmental tobacco smoke, and gaseous heavy metals in its pathogenesis. Finally, this review outlines the latent effect of air pollution in ESKD patients undergoing dialysis or renal transplant, kidney cancer and other kidney diseases.

Comparative analysis was performed between the two groups in terms of tumor size reduction, retreatment and complication rates. RESULT Forty-two patients (37 (88.1%) female, 5 (11.9%) male) harboring 48 AMLs were included in the study. The mean age was 43.46 (range 20 to 78). The technical success rate was 95.8% (46 of 48 procedures). The mean size reduction was 1.94±1 cm (p < 0.001) after treatments however, no significant difference was seen between groups in terms of tumor size reduction. Retreatment rates were 3.1% (1 of 32 cases) in group A and 14.3% (2 of 14 cases) in group B (p = 0.21). No significant difference was found between groups in terms of bleeding and complication rates during the perioperative period. Mean follow-up duration was 26.48±25.71 (range from 2 to 102) months. CONCLUSION In this study, no clear supplementary benefit was observed in terms of safety, and efficacy with the adjunction of coils to distal particle embolization in the management of AMLs."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of a multimodal Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol on perioperative opioid consumption and hospital length of stay (LOS) after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We compared the first 176 patients enrolled in the protocol (ERAS group) with the previous 176 patients (non-ERAS group) at a single quaternary institution from December 2017 to June 2019. The ERAS protocol included a multimodal opioid-sparing regimen utilizing acetaminophen, gabapentin, celecoxib, and liposomal bupivacaine. Demographic data, co-morbidities, post-operative pain scores, post-operative opiate consumption measured by morphine milligram equivalents (MME), operating time, and LOS were collected. The two groups were compared using chi-squared, Fisher exact, or Student t tests as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of prolonged LOS (> 1 day). The ERAS and non-ERAS groups were equivalent in terms of baseline characteristics and pathological data. The ERAS group had lower post-operative pain scores, post-operative opiate consumption (MME 15 vs. 46, p < 0.01), and LOS (1.2 vs. 1.7 days, p < 0.01) compared to the non-ERAS group. Only 22% in the ERAS cohort had a prolonged LOS compared to 39% of the non-ERAS group (p < 0.01). The ERAS protocol was a negative predictor of prolonged LOS on multivariable logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.70, p < 0.01). A limitation of this study is its single-center retrospective design. The implementation of a multimodal opioid-sparing ERAS protocol was associated with improved pain control, reduced perioperative opioid usage, and shorter LOS after RARP."

The GGG 5 group consisted of 78 patients with GS 4+5 and 29 patients with GS 5+4 or higher. The 5-year BCR-free survival rates for men with GGG 4, GS 4+5, and GS 5+4 or higher were 59%, 54%, and 20%, respectively, and the 5-year CRPC-free survival rates were 98%, 100%, and 88%, respectively. Both the BCR- and CRPC-free survival rates were significantly higher in GS 4+5 than in GS 5+4 or higher (P < .001 and P = .002, respectively), but there were no significant differences between GGG 4 and GS 4+5 (P = .702 and P = .803, respectively). The multivariate analysis demonstrated that GS 5+4 or higher (hazard ratio, 3.4; P = .002) and lymphovascular invasion (hazard ratio, 3.4; P < .001) greatly affected BCR.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Our follow-up study revealed that men with GS 4+5 and those with GGG 4 had a similar prognosis. However, there was a significant discrepancy in prognosis between GS 4+5 and GS 5+4 or higher. This suggested that GGG 4 and 5 in the contemporary prostate cancer grading system should be reviewed. Furthermore, lymphovascular invasion may be useful to subgroup these pathologically high-risk patients."

Whether this association is affected by the preoperative risk of AKI has never been investigated.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effect of the interaction between the preoperative risk of AKI and ischemia time on the probability of AKI during PN.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      Data of 944 patients treated with on-clamp PN for cT1 renal tumors were extracted from the Registry of Conservative and Radical Surgery for Cortical Renal Tumor Disease (RECORD2) database, a prospective multicenter project.\n    \n\n\n          Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:\n        \n      \n      We estimated the preoperative risk of AKI (defined according to the risk/injury/failure/loss/end-stage [RIFLE] criteria) according to age, baseline renal function, clinical stage, preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical (PADUA) score, and surgical approach. Classification and regression tree (CART) analysis identified patients at \"high\" and \"low\" risk of AKI.

At multivariable analysis, older patients, those with more complex tumors, those with higher baseline function, and those treated with open surgery had an increased risk of AKI (all p ≤ 0.011). According to the first split at CART analysis, patients were categorized as those with \"high\" and \"low\" risk of AKI having a probability of >40% or <40%. For low-risk patients, the probability of AKI in case of <10 versus >20 min of ischemia was 13% versus 28% (absolute risk increase 15%). The risk of AKI for high-risk patients who had <10 versus >20 min of ischemia was 31% versus 77%. This corresponds to an absolute risk increase of 45%.

As a fundamental first step to bring TIL therapy to clinical use, identification of patients whose tumors yield optimal numbers of reactive TIL is indispensable. We have previously shown that expansion of tumor reactive TIL from primary bladder tumors and lymph node metastases is feasible. Here, we performed TIL harvesting from additional surgical specimens (additional 31 primary tumors and 10 lymph nodes) to generate a heterogenous cohort of 53 patients with bladder cancer (BC) to evaluate the tumor characteristics that lead to tumor-reactive TIL expansion. Among a total of 53 patients, overall TIL growth from tumor samples were 37/53 (69.8%) and overall anti-tumor reactive TIL were 26/35 (74.3%). Mixed urothelial carcinoma is associated with higher anti-tumor reactivity of expanded TIL than pure urothelial carcinoma (89.5% vs. 56.3%, p=0.049). The anti-tumor reactivity of expanded TIL from primary tumors previously treated with BCG immunotherapy were lower (33.3% vs. 82.6%, p=0.027) although T-cell phenotype (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD56+) was similar regardless prior of BCG therapy. Addition of agonistic 4-1BB antibody in culture media with IL-2 improved the number of expanded TIL from primary tumors previously treated with BCG immunotherapy. There was no significant difference between basal and luminal subtype tumors in terms of viable and reactive TIL growth. Our study demonstrates that TIL expansion is feasible across all BC patients and BC subtypes, and we suggest that TIL therapy can be a reasonable treatment strategy for various manifestations of BC."

We aimed to investigate the performance of AI systems at detecting clinically significant prostate cancer on MRI in comparison with radiologists using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS 2.1) and the standard of care in multidisciplinary routine practice at scale.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this international, paired, non-inferiority, confirmatory study, we trained and externally validated an AI system (developed within an international consortium) for detecting Gleason grade group 2 or greater cancers using a retrospective cohort of 10 207 MRI examinations from 9129 patients. Of these examinations, 9207 cases from three centres (11 sites) based in the Netherlands were used for training and tuning, and 1000 cases from four centres (12 sites) based in the Netherlands and Norway were used for testing. In parallel, we facilitated a multireader, multicase observer study with 62 radiologists (45 centres in 20 countries; median 7 [IQR 5-10] years of experience in reading prostate MRI) using PI-RADS (2.1) on 400 paired MRI examinations from the testing cohort. Primary endpoints were the sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system in comparison with that of all readers using PI-RADS (2.1) and in comparison with that of the historical radiology readings made during multidisciplinary routine practice (ie, the standard of care with the aid of patient history and peer consultation). Histopathology and at least 3 years (median 5 [IQR 4-6] years) of follow-up were used to establish the reference standard. The statistical analysis plan was prespecified with a primary hypothesis of non-inferiority (considering a margin of 0·05) and a secondary hypothesis of superiority towards the AI system, if non-inferiority was confirmed.

In the subset of 400 testing cases in which the AI system was compared with the radiologists participating in the reader study, the AI system showed a statistically superior and non-inferior AUROC of 0·91 (95% CI 0·87-0·94; p<0·0001), in comparison to the pool of 62 radiologists with an AUROC of 0·86 (0·83-0·89), with a lower boundary of the two-sided 95% Wald CI for the difference in AUROC of 0·02. At the mean PI-RADS 3 or greater operating point of all readers, the AI system detected 6·8% more cases with Gleason grade group 2 or greater cancers at the same specificity (57·7%, 95% CI 51·6-63·3), or 50·4% fewer false-positive results and 20·0% fewer cases with Gleason grade group 1 cancers at the same sensitivity (89·4%, 95% CI 85·3-92·9). In all 1000 testing cases where the AI system was compared with the radiology readings made during multidisciplinary practice, non-inferiority was not confirmed, as the AI system showed lower specificity (68·9% [95% CI 65·3-72·4] vs 69·0% [65·5-72·5]) at the same sensitivity (96·1%, 94·0-98·2) as the PI-RADS 3 or greater operating point.

Data were obtained from Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe), a research database with data from several national health care registers including clinical characteristics and treatments for nearly all men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Sweden. Four outcomes were analysed: use of pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2018-2020 (n = 11,843), primary treatment of high-risk non-metastatic disease in 2016-2020 (n = 6633), rehabilitation (≥2 dispensed prescriptions for erectile dysfunction within 1 year from surgery in 2016-2020, n = 6505), and prostate cancer death in 7770 men with high-risk non-metastatic disease diagnosed in 2010-2016. Unadjusted and adjusted odds and hazard ratios (OR/HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Adjusted odds ratio (ORs) comparing low versus high individual education were 0.74 (95% CI 0.66-0.83) for pre-biopsy MRI, 0.66 (0.54-0.81) for primary treatment, and 0.82 (0.69-0.97) for rehabilitation. HR gradients for prostate cancer death were significant on unadjusted analysis only (low vs. high individual education HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.17-1.70); co-variate adjustments markedly attenuated the gradients (low vs. high individual education HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.90-1.35). Generally, neighbourhood-level analyses showed weaker gradients over the socioeconomic strata, except for pre-biopsy MRI. Socioeconomic factors influenced how men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in Sweden but had less influence on subsequent specialist care. Neighbourhood-level socioeconomic data are more useful for evaluating inequality in diagnostics than in later specialist care."

Methods: Four hundred seven patients who underwent Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys radiolabeled with 68Ga-gallium N,N-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N-diacetic acid (68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) PET (combined with a diagnostic CT) were retrospectively analyzed. The number of 68Ga-PSMA PET-positive cervical, celiac, and sacral ganglia was determined, and the configuration and SUVmax of each ganglion were measured. In addition, the configuration and SUVmax of adjacent lymph node metastases in the respective region (cervical, celiac, or sacral) were determined. Results:68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake above background was detected in 401 (98.5%) patients in any peripheral ganglia, in 369 (92%) patients in cervical ganglia, in 363 (89%) patients in celiac ganglia, and in 183 (46%) patients in sacral ganglia. The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake was highest in celiac (mean SUVmax, 2.9 ± 0.8 vs. cervical mean SUVmax, 2.4 ± 0.6) and sacral (mean SUVmax 1.7 ± 0.5; both P < 0.0001) ganglia. Intraindividually there was a statistically significant but weak to moderate correlation between the 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake in cervical versus celiac ganglia (R = 0.34, P < 0.0001), cervical versus sacral (R = 0.52, P < 0.0001), and celiac versus sacral (R = 0.16, P < 0.05). The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake was significantly more intense in adjacent lymph node metastases than the respective ganglia (cervical: 18.0 ± 16.2 vs. 2.4 ± 0.6, P < 0.0001; celiac: 13.5 ± 12.3 vs. 2.9 ± 0.8, P < 0.0001; sacral: 13.4 ± 11.6 vs. 1.7 ± 0.5, P < 0.0001). Furthermore, ganglia predominantly exhibit a band-shaped configuration (71.2%), followed by a teardrop (26.8%) and only rarely a nodular configuration (2.0%). Conversely, lymph node metastases are only rarely band-shaped (1.1%), but more often show teardrop (40.3%) or nodular appearance (58.6%) (P < 0.00001). Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake in ganglia along the sympathetic trunk as assessed by 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET represents an important pitfall in prostate cancer PET imaging. The 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake is higher in celiac ganglia than cervical or sacral ganglia, and the level of 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake seems to be patient-related. For the differentiation between lymph node metastases and sympathetic ganglia, both intensity of 68Ga-PSMA-ligand uptake and exact localization and configuration of the respective lesion should be examined carefully."

The PTEN deletion emerged as a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence independent of the standard clinicopathologic parameters (hazard ratio: 3.00, 95% confidence interval: 1.81-4.98; P < 0.0001) and further stratified patients with low and intermediate risk of biochemical recurrence [Gleason grade group 1-2 (≤3 + 4), Gleason grade group 2 (3 + 4), pT2, prostate-specific antigen ≤ 10, low and intermediate CAPRA-S score; log-rank P ≤ 0.007]. A PTEN deletion also increased the risk of distant metastasis (log-rank, P = 0.001), further supporting its role in prostate cancer progression. Combining both 16p13.3 gain and PTEN deletion improved biochemical recurrence risk stratification and provided prognostic information beyond the established CAPRA-S score (co-alteration: hazard ratio: 4.70, 95% confidence interval: 2.12-10.42; P < 0.0001). Our study demonstrates the potential clinical utility of PTEN genomic deletion in low-intermediate risk patients and highlights the enhanced prognostication achieved when assessed in combination with another genomic biomarker related to the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby supporting their promising usefulness in clinical management of prostate cancer."

For both RCC and melanoma patients, progressive or stable disease was associated with an increase in sPD-L1 on nivolumab therapy, whereas mean sPD-L1 levels did not change or declined in patients with objective responses. By categorizing RCC patients into transcriptomic molecular subtypes, we identified a subgroup where the associations between sPD-L1 and progressive disease were particularly evident. In baseline biopsies, we identified six biological processes that were associated with sPD-L1 level in both RCC and melanoma: higher sPD-L1 is associated with lower tumor expression of the Hallmark gene sets 'hypoxia', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'glycolysis', 'MTORC1 signaling' and 'androgen response', and with higher expression of 'KRAS signaling_Down'.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Baseline and on-therapy sPD-L1 levels in RCC have the potential to predict progressive disease on PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab. In a hypothesis-generating analysis of tumor gene expression, high baseline sPD-L1 is associated with a tumor metabolic state reflecting potentially targetable processes in both melanoma and RCC. In both trials, we observed associations between change in sPD-L1 on treatment and outcome metrics. sPD-L1 levels may further refine a nivolumab-refractory subtype of RCC within transcriptionally based subtypes of RCC."

Patients had higher tumor purity and better prognosis in the low-TPS group. Tumor purity was related to the infiltration of mast cells and macrophage cells positively, whereas related to the infiltration of dendritic cells, T cells and B cells negatively in PCa. The nomogram based on TPS, Age, Gleason score and T stage had a good predictive value and could evaluate the prognosis of PCa metastasis. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses showed that hub genes mainly participate in T cell activation and T-helper lymphocytes (TH) differentiation.

When evaluating these imaging findings based on the PSMA reporting and data system version 1.0, which categorize lesions based on their likelihood of prostate cancer involvement, PSMA-RADS-3A lesions are commonly seen, which are indeterminate for the presence of disease. A total of 28 patients with 171 PSMA-RADS-3A lesions on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scans from June 2016 to May 2017 who had follow-up cross-sectional imaging over time were included in this study. The PSA levels of patients with PSMA-RADS-3A lesions were categorized into four groups, 0-0.2, 0.2-1, 1-2, and >2 ng/mL. The pre-operative Gleason score of these patients was categorized into two groups, Gleason score < 7 or ≥7. The median age for these patients was 72.5 years (range 59-81). The median PSA value for patients with positive lesions was significantly higher than those with negative lesions (5.8 ng/mL vs. 0.2 ng/mL, p < 0.0001). The lesion positivity rate was significantly higher in patients with PSA > 1 ng/mL (18.2% vs. 81.9%, p < 0.001). On ROC analysis, the highest classification accuracy was seen at PSA ≥ 0.6 ng/mL of 80.12% (95% CI = 73.69-86.16%), and the area under the curve was 71.32% (95% CI = 61.9-80.7%, p < 0.0001).

We sought to explore the incidence of BRCA1/2 reversion mutations in different tumor types. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed molecular profiling results from primary and/or metastatic tumor samples submitted by multiple institutions. The samples underwent DNA and RNA sequencing at a CLIA/CAP-certified clinical lab. Reversion mutations were called only in patients whose available clinical records showed the use of PARP inhibitors or platinum agents prior to tumor profiling. Results: Reversion mutations were identified in 75 of 247,926 samples profiled across all tumor types. Among patients carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations, reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were seen in ovarian cancer (OC) (30/3424), breast cancer (BC) (27/1460), endometrial cancer (4/564), pancreatic cancer (2/340), cholangiocarcinoma (2/178), prostate cancer (5/461), cervical cancer (1/117), cancer of unknown primary (1/244), bladder cancer (1/300), malignant pleural mesothelioma (1/10), and a neuroendocrine tumor of the prostate. We identified 22 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 8 in BRCA2 in OC. In BC, we detected 6 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. We compared molecular profile results of 14 high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) with reversion mutations against 87 control HGSOC with pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations without reversion mutations. Tumors with reversion mutations trended to have had lower ER expression (25% vs. 64%, p = 0.024, q = 0.82) and higher KDM6A mutation rate (15% vs. 0, p = 0.016, q = 0.82). Conclusions: We present one of the largest datasets reporting reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes across various tumor types. These reversion mutations were rare; this may be because some patients may not have had repeat profiling post-treatment.

            "abstract": "Although outdoor air pollution and particulate matter in outdoor air have been consistently linked with increased lung cancer risk, the evidence for associations at other cancer sites is limited. Bladder cancer shares several risk factors with lung cancer and some positive associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk have been observed. This study examined associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk in the large-scale Spanish Bladder Cancer Study. Estimates of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5 ) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2 ) concentrations were assigned to the geocoded participant residence of 938 incident bladder cancer cases and 973 hospital controls based on European multicity land-use regression models. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models. Overall, there was no clear association between either ambient PM2.5 (OR per 5.9 μg/m3 = 1.06, 95% CI 0.71-1.60) or NO2 (OR per 14.2 μg/m3 = 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-1.13) concentrations and incident bladder cancer risk. There was no clear evidence for effect modification according to age group, sex, region, education, cigarette smoking status, or pack-years. Results were also similar among more residentially stable participants and in two-pollutant models. Overall, there was no clear evidence for associations of ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations and incident bladder cancer risk. Further research in other large-scale population studies is needed with detailed information on measured or modeled estimates of ambient air pollution concentrations and individual level risk factors."

Materials and Methods: A Pubmed search of all studies comparing standardized incidence ratio (SIR) or odds ratio (OR) or relative risks (RR) of PC between IBD and non IBD groups, published until March 2020 was conducted. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO. Twelve studies, mostly population studies, were included. The quality score of these studies, evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, was 7. The heterogeneity was high among the studies in which ulcerative colitis (UC) was considered separate from Crohn's disease (CD) and in the studies that considered UC and CD together (\"IBD-studies\"), while it was low in the studies which considered CD separate from UC. Results: The relative risk of developing PC was 1.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.51, p = 0.007) in IBD, 1.10 (95%CI 0.98-1.25, p = 0.116) in CD, and 1.22 (95%CI 0.98-1.51, p = 0.07) in UC.

To evaluate their potential health effects, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using dispersion modeling for exposure assessment.\n## METHODS\nA fixed cohort was enrolled in the Rome Longitudinal Study in 2001, mortality and hospitalizations were followed-up until 2010. Exposure assessments to the landfill (H2S), the incinerator (PM10), and the refinery plant (SOX) were performed for each subject using a Lagrangian dispersion model. Individual and small-area variables were available (including exposures levels to NO2 from traffic and diesel trucks). Cox regression analysis was performed (hazard ratios, HRs, 95% CI) using linear terms for the exposures (5th-95th percentiles difference). Single and bi-pollutant models were run.\n## RESULTS\nThe cohort included 85,559 individuals. The estimated annual average exposures levels were correlated. H2S from the landfill was associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both genders (HR 1.04 95% CI 1.00-1.09 in women); PM10 from the incinerator was associated with pancreatic cancer mortality in both genders (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.03-1.90 in men, HR 1.47 95% CI 1.12-1.93 in women) and with breast morbidity in women (HR 1.13 95% CI 1.00-1.27).

From July to December 2016, we enrolled 60 patients who met the enrollment criteria and divided them into two groups: (1) the simple cryoablation group (n=30); and (2) the cryoablation combined with allogenic NK cells group (n=30). The clinical efficacy, quality of life, immune function, and other related indicators were evaluated. Combining allogeneic NK cells with cryoablation had a synergistic effect, not only enhancing the immune function and improving the quality of life of the patients, but also significantly exhibiting good clinical efficacy of the patients. This study is the first clinical trial that has evaluated the safety and efficacy of allogenic NK cells combined with cryosurgery for the treatment of renal cell cancer."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Prostate cancer prognosis is variable, and management decisions involve balancing patients' risks of recurrence and recurrence-free death. Moreover, the roles of body mass index (BMI) and race in risk of recurrence are controversial [1,2]. To address these issues, we developed and cross-validated RAPS (Risks After Prostate Surgery), a personal prediction model for biochemical recurrence (BCR) within 10 years of radical prostatectomy (RP) that includes BMI and race as possible predictors, and recurrence-free death as a competing risk.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      RAPS uses a patient's risk factors at surgery to assign him a recurrence probability based on statistical learning methods applied to a cohort of 1,276 patients undergoing RP at the University of Pennsylvania. We compared the performance of RAPS to that of an existing model with respect to calibration (by comparing observed and predicted outcomes), and discrimination (using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RAPS' cross-validated BCR predictions provided better calibration than those of an existing model that underestimated patients' risks.

RAPS' most important BCR predictors were tumor grade, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and BMI; race was less important [3].

To begin to understand this phenomenon, we reviewed the clinical, morphological, and immunohistochemical features of 11 carcinomas of the urologic tract, mainly urothelial (N = 9) and collecting duct carcinomas (N = 2), occurring during immunosuppression, and expressing polyoma virus T-antigen by immunohistochemistry. These were compared to a control group of carcinomas (N = 8), also arising during immunosuppression, but without T-antigen expression. A subset of both groups were also studied by hybrid capture-based DNA sequencing, probing not only for 479 cancer-related human genes, but also for polyoma and other viral sequences. Polyoma T-antigen-expressing tumors arose in 7 males and 4 females, at a median age of 66, and were aggressive, high-grade tumors with more than 1 variant morphologic pattern identified in 81% of cases, and a majority (73%) presenting at high stage category (>pT3). Diffuse polyoma T-antigen staining was seen in 91% of cases, with co-localization of aberrant p53 staining in 89%. Sequencing detected a lower number of deleterious mutations among T-antigen-expressing cases (average 1.62; 1/8 with TP53 mutation) compared to control cases (average 3.5, 2/4 with TP53 mutation). Only BK virus was detected with clonal integration and breakpoints randomly distributed across the human and viral genomes in 5/5 of the polyoma T-antigen-expressing carcinomas, and in none of the controls (0/4). In summary, these findings identify aggressive clinicopathologic features of polyoma T-antigen-expressing carcinomas, document BK as the strain involved, and associate BK viral integration with T-antigen expression and p53 aberrancy. While the apparent randomness of viral insertion sites is functionally unclear, the differing rates of mutations between T-antigen-expressing and control cases is intriguing."

The American College of Radiology Incidental Findings Committee's white paper on renal masses recommends additional imaging for incidental homogeneous renal masses greater than 20 HU, but single-center data and the Bosniak classification version 2019 suggest the optimal attenuation threshold for detecting solid masses should be higher. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to determine the clinical importance of small (10-40 mm) incidentally detected homogeneous renal masses measuring 21-39 HU at portal venous phase CT. METHODS. We performed a 12-institution retrospective cohort study of adult patients who underwent portal venous phase CT for a nonrenal indication. The date of the first CT at each institution ranged from January 1, 2008, to January 1, 2014. Consecutive reports from 12,167 portal venous phase CT examinations were evaluated. Images were reviewed for 4529 CT examinations whose report described a focal renal mass. Eligible masses were 10-40 mm, well-defined, subjectively homogeneous, and 21-39 HU. Of these, masses that were shown to be solid without macroscopic fat; classified as Bosniak IIF, III, or IV; or confirmed to be malignant were considered clinically important. The reference standard was renal mass protocol CT or MRI, ultrasound of definitively benign cysts or solid masses, single-phase contrast-enhanced CT or unenhanced MRI showing no growth or morphologic change for 5 years or more, or clinical follow-up 5 years or greater. A reference standard was available for 346 masses in 300 patients. The 95% CIs were calculated using the binomial exact method. RESULTS. Eligible masses were identified in 4.2% of patients (514/12,167; 95% CI, 3.9-4.6%). Of 346 masses with a reference standard, none were clinically important (0%; 95% CI, 0-0.9%). Mean mass size was 17 mm; 72% (248/346) measured 21-30 HU, and 28% (98/346) measured 31-39 HU. CONCLUSION. Incidental small homogeneous renal masses measuring 21-39 HU at portal venous phase CT are common and highly likely benign. CLINICAL IMPACT. The change in attenuation threshold signifying the need for additional imaging from greater than 20 HU to greater than 30 HU proposed by the Bosniak classification version 2019 is supported."

Patients without pelvic nodal positivity (n= 32) were treated by radiotherapy (RT) (n = 25) or chemotherapy (n = 7); CCRT (n = 6) or chemotherapy (n = 7) was used in patients with positive pelvic nodes (n = 13). Data was collected for age, comorbidities, body mass index, tobacco exposure, treatment modality, tumor grade, pathological T and N stage, and extra-nodal extension. OS was compared between different treatment modalities stratifying patients with and without pelvic nodal positivity. Multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis was used to narrow down remaining variables and Inverse Probability Treatment Weights modeling was used to determine average treatment effect.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      About 12 of 14 patients in the chemotherapy group received both cisplatin and paclitaxel.

Among patients with nodal positivity restricted to groin the estimated average OS when all patients received adjuvant RT was 1,438 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 1,256-1,619 days, Pvalue <0.0001). The estimated average OS if all patients received chemotherapy was lower by 1,007 days (95% CI 810-1,202 days, P value <0.0001). Among patients with positive pelvic nodes the estimated average OS when all patients received adjuvant CCRT was 467 days (95% CI 368-566 days, P value <0.0001).

Genetic alteration and DNA methylation data were downloaded from the cBioPortal and MethSurv. The functional enrichment data were analyzed by Metascape. Results: The mRNA expression of the CDCAs, except CBX2, was significantly increased in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients. Genetic alterations might affect the expression of CDCAs, but promotor methylation does not affect CDCA gene expression.

The present analysis was conducted from May 10, 2018, to October 15, 2020.\n    \n\n\n          Interventions:\n        \n      \n      Patients were randomized (2:1) to apalutamide, 240 mg/d, with androgen deprivation therapy (apalutamide+ADT) or placebo+ADT.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk categories for developing metastases based on genomic classifier (GC) scores for high (GC >0.6) and low to average (GC≤0.6) and into basal and luminal subtypes; associations between these molecular subtypes and metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival 2 (PFS2) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Median age of the 233 included patients was 73 (range, 49-91) years. A total of 116 of 233 patients (50%) in the SPARTAN biomarker subset had high GC scores. Although all patients receiving apalutamide+ADT had improved outcomes, having high GC scores was associated with the greatest improvement in MFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.11-0.40; P < .001), OS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.94; P = .03), and PFS2 (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.67; P = .001) vs placebo+ADT. In total, 152 of 233 patients (65%) had the basal molecular subtype. Although there were no significant differences in MFS, PFS2, or OS between patients with the luminal vs basal subtype in the placebo+ADT arm, patients with the luminal subtype in the apalutamide+ADT arm had a significantly longer MFS (apalutamide+ADT: HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18-0.91; P = .03; placebo+ADT: HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.33-1.31; P = .23) compared with patients with basal subtype; similar trends were observed for OS (apalutamide+ADT: HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.25-0.98; P = .04; placebo+ADT: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.38-1.60; P = .50), and PFS2 (apalutamide+ADT: HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42-1.22; P = .22; placebo+ADT: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.38-1.39; P = .33). In regression analysis, the luminal-basal subtype score was significantly associated with MFS in patients receiving apalutamide+ADT (HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.15-6.08; P = .02), whereas GC score was significantly associated with MFS in placebo+ADT recipients (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.02-4.27; P = .04).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      The findings of this study suggest that the GC score and basal-luminal subtype derived from archived tumor specimens may be biomarkers of response to apalutamide+ADT in the nmCRPC setting. Although overall, the addition of apalutamide to ADT was beneficial, higher-risk and luminal subtypes appeared to benefit most. Obtaining GC scores may be useful for identifying patients for early treatment intensification with apalutamide, and basal-luminal subtyping may be a beneficial approach for patient selection for further treatment intensification in trials combining novel therapies with apalutamide."

Notably, it is now well established that the immune infiltrate in human tumors can correlate with prognosis and response to therapy. The analysis of the immune infiltrate in the tumor microenvironment has become a major challenge for the classification of patients and the response to treatment. The co-expression of inhibitory receptors such as Program Cell Death Protein 1 (PD1; also known as CD279), Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA-4), T-Cell Immunoglobulin and Mucin Containing Protein-3 (Tim-3; also known as CD366), and Lymphocyte Activation Gene 3 (Lag-3; also known as CD223), is a hallmark of T cell exhaustion. We developed a multiparametric in situ immunofluorescence staining to identify and quantify at the cellular level the co-expression of these inhibitory receptors. On a retrospective series of frozen tissue of renal cell carcinomas (RCC), using a fluorescence multispectral imaging technology coupled with an image analysis software, it was found that co-expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 on tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells is correlated with a poor prognosis in RCC.

This study aimed to identify novel DNA hypermethylation markers for PCa with future potential for blood-based testing. Accordingly, to search for genes specifically hypermethylated in PCa tissue samples and not in blood cells or other cancer tissue types, we performed a systematic analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation data (Infinium 450K array) available in the Marmal-aid database for 4072 malignant/normal tissue samples of various types. We identified eight top candidate markers (cg12799885, DOCK2, FBXO30, GRASP, HIF3A, MOB3B, PFKP, and TPM4) that were specifically hypermethylated in PCa tissue samples and hypomethylated in other benign and malignant tissue types, including in peripheral blood cells. Potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers was further assessed by the quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) analysis of 37 nonmalignant and 197 PCa tissue samples from an independent population. Here, all eight hypermethylated candidates showed high sensitivity (75⁻94%) and specificity (84⁻100%) for PCa. Furthermore, DOCK2, GRASP, HIF3A and PKFP hypermethylation was significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP; 197 patients), independent of the routine clinicopathological variables. DOCK2 is the most promising single candidate marker (hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval (CI)): 1.96 (1.24⁻3.10), adjusted p = 0.016; multivariate cox regression).

The objective of this study was to assess the individual protein expression and co-expression of Twist, Slug (Snai2), Snail (Snai1), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (Hif-1α) in prostate cancer in relation to EMT, angiogenesis, hypoxia, tumour features, disease recurrence, and patient survival. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on tissue microarray sections from 338 radical prostatectomies with long follow-up. In addition, 41 cases of prostatic hyperplasia, 33 non-skeletal metastases, 13 skeletal metastases, and 33 castration-resistant prostate carcinomas were included. Our findings were validated in external gene expression data sets. Twist was overexpressed in primary prostate cancer and markedly reduced in distant metastases (p < 0.0005). Strong expression of Twist and Slug was associated with Hif-1α in localised prostate cancer (p ≤ 0.001), and strong Twist was associated with Hif-1α in castration-resistant carcinomas (p = 0.044). Twist, Slug, and increased Snail at the tumour stromal border were associated with vascular factors (p ≤ 0.045). Each of the three EMT-regulating transcription factors were associated with aggressive tumour features and shorter time to recurrence and cancer-specific death. Notably, the co-expression of factors demonstrated an enhanced influence on outcome. In the subgroup of E-cadherinlow carcinomas, strong Slug was associated with shorter time to all end points and was an independent predictor of time to multiple end points, including cancer-specific death (hazard ratio 3.0, p = 0.041). To conclude, we demonstrate an important relation between EMT, hypoxia, and angiogenesis and a strong link between the investigated EMT regulators and aggressive tumour features and poor patient outcome in prostate cancer. Despite the retrospective nature of this long-term study, our findings could have a significant impact on the future treatment of prostate cancer, where tailored therapies might be directed simultaneously against epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes, angiogenesis, and tumour hypoxia."

Here, we aimed to find predictors who will receive the greatest benefits from ARATAs.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We previously performed a multicenter study to identify prognostic factors for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC, n = 148) and mCRPC (n = 99), and showed that the bone scan index (BSI) was one of the significant prognostic factors for 3-year OS (PROSTAT-BSI study). mHSPC progressed to mCRPC (n = 101), for which 69 patients were treated with (n = 39) or without ARATAs (n = 30, prior to the approval of ARATAs). The 69 patients were divided into two groups according to patient factors, and these cohorts were further divided into two subgroups by usage of ARATAs. OS was compared between subgroups in each group.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The predictors were age (<71.4 years), serum levels of C-reactive protein (≥0.16 ng/ml) and alkaline phosphatase (≥548 U/L), time to PSA progression after ADT (<8.9 months), the lowest PSA level (≥1 ng/ml) after ADT, and the rate of PSA decline 3 months after ADT (<0.987), whereas hemoglobin levels, PSA before ADT, Gleason scores, existence of visceral metastases, and BSI were not.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The present study identified predictors for the effectiveness of ARATAs.

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer is a widespread malignancy characterized by a comparative ease of primary diagnosis and difficulty in choosing the individualized course of treatment. Management of prostate cancer would benefit from a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the transition to the lethal, late-stage forms of the disease, which could potentially yield new biomarkers for differential prognosis and treatment prioritization in addition to possible new therapeutic targets. Epidemiological research has uncovered a significant correlation of prostate cancer incidence and progression with the intake (and often co-intake) of fatty acids and calcium. Additionally, there is evidence of the impact of these nutrients on intracellular signaling, including the mechanisms mediated by the calcium ion as a second messenger. The present review surveys the recent literature on the molecular mechanisms associated with the critical steps in the prostate cancer progression, with special attention paid to the regulation of these processes by fatty acids and calcium homeostasis. Testable hypotheses are put forward that integrate some of the recent results in a more unified picture of these phenomena at the interface of cell signaling and metabolism."

Due to the complicated interaction between a tumor and its microenvironment, single biomarkers, such as PDL1 protein level, tumor mutational burden (TMB), single gene mutation and expression, are far from satisfactory for response prediction or patient stratification. Recently, combinatorial biomarkers were reported to be more precise and powerful for predicting therapy response and identifying potential target populations with superior survival. However, there is a lack of dedicated tools for such combinatorial biomarker analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Here, we present dualmarker, an R package designed to facilitate the data exploration for dual biomarker combinations. Given two biomarkers, dualmarker comprehensively visualizes their association with drug response and patient survival through 14 types of plots, such as boxplots, scatterplots, ROCs, and Kaplan-Meier plots. Using logistic regression and Cox regression models, dualmarker evaluated the superiority of dual markers over single markers by comparing the data fitness of dual-marker versus single-marker models, which was utilized for de novo searching for new biomarker pairs. We demonstrated this straightforward workflow and comprehensive capability by using public biomarker data from one bladder cancer patient cohort (IMvigor210 study); we confirmed the previously reported biomarker pair TMB/TGF-beta signature and CXCL13 expression/ARID1A mutation for response and survival analyses, respectively. In addition, dualmarker de novo identified new biomarker partners, for example, in overall survival modelling, the model with combination of HMGB1 expression and ARID1A mutation had statistically better goodness-of-fit than the model with either HMGB1 or ARID1A as single marker.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The dualmarker package is an open-source tool for the visualization and identification of combinatorial dual biomarkers.

Currently, renal mass biopsies are commonly employed to extract disease characteristics and aid prognosis.

To generate a gene signature to distinguish high-grade ccRCC, we used the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database to develop a gene expression signature for distinguishing high-grade (G3/4) from low-grade (G1/2) disease. The expression profile was further validated for performance and clinical use in 283 frozen renal cancer samples and 127 ex vivo renal mass biopsy samples, respectively. The area under curve (AUC) was used to quantify discriminative ability and was compared using the De-long test. Using the discovery dataset, we identified a 24-gene signature for high-grade disease with an AUC of 0.884. After applied to the development dataset, an eight-gene profile was defined and achieved an AUC of 0.823. Accuracy of eight-gene panel was maintained in the renal mass biopsies (RMB) samples (AUC = 0.821). In summary, using three-stage design, we validated an eight-gene expression signature for predicting high Fuhrman grade of ccRCC.

Yet, few data are available on therapy efficacy in the subgroup with visceral metastases, who represent a small population with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to describe the clinical experience of AAP in patients with mCRPC with liver and/or lung metastases in real-world setting. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with mCRPC with liver and/or lung metastases treated at the National Cancer Institute 'Fondazione G.

            "abstract": "Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is well-recognized as a morphologically and molecularly heterogenous group of kidney tumors with variable clinical behavior. Our goal was to analyze a unique histologic pattern of PRCC we have observed in routine practice to evaluate for potential clinical significance or distinct molecular signature. We identified 42 cases of PRCC showing a morphologically distinct architecture characterized by numerous epithelial-lined cysts containing the papillary tumor (herein called \"microcysts\"), which are typically separated by fibrous stroma. Of the initial 42 case test set with microcystic features, 23 (55%) were stage pT3a or higher. Most tumors had strong and diffuse cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for CK7 (93%, 37/40) and AMACR (100%, 40/40). Fumarate hydratase staining was retained in all cases tested (39/39). We performed next-generation sequencing on 15 of these cases with available tissue and identified chromosomal alterations commonly reported in historically \"type 1\" PRCC, notably multiple chromosomal gains, particularly of chromosomes 7 and 17, and MET alterations. However, alterations in pathways associated with more aggressive behavior (including SETD2, CDKN2A, and members of the NRF pathway) were also identified in 6 of 15 cases tested (40%). Given this molecular and immunophenotypic data, we subsequently reviewed an additional group of 60 consecutive pT2b-pT3 PRCCs to allow for comparisons between cases with and without microcysts, to assess for potential associations with other recently described histologic patterns (ie, \"unfavorable architecture\": micropapillary, solid, and hobnail), and to assess interobserver reproducibility for diagnosing architectural patterns and grade. Of the total combined 102 PRCCs, 67 (66%) had microcystic architecture within the intrarenal component but were commonly admixed with other patterns (39% had micropapillary, 31% solid, and 31% hobnail). Twenty-seven cases (26%) had metastatic disease, and 24 of these 27 (89%) had microcystic architecture in the intrarenal tumor. Within the pT3 subset, 21 of 22 cases with metastases (95%) had extrarenal invasion as either individual microcysts in renal sinus fat or aggregates of microcysts bulging beyond the confines of the capsule. Backward elimination and stepwise regression methods to detect features significantly associated with adverse outcome identified solid architecture (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.3; confidence interval [CI]: 2.1-18.8; P=0.001), hobnail architecture (HR: 5.3; CI: 1.7-16.7; P=0.004), and microcystic architecture at the tumor-stromal interface (HR: 4.2; CI: 1.1-16.7; P=0.036) as strongest. Of architectural patterns and grade, the microcystic pattern had a substantial interobserver agreement (κ score=0.795) that was highest among the 6 observers. In summary, PRCCs with microcystic architecture represents a subset of historically \"type 1\" PRCC with a predilection for morphologically distinctive extrarenal involvement and metastatic disease. Microcysts co-vary with other \"unfavorable\" architectural patterns also associated with higher risk for aggressive disease (ie, micropapillary, hobnail, and solid), but microcysts were more common and have superior interobserver reproducibility. These findings suggest that microcystic PRCC should be recognized as a potentially aggressive histologic pattern of growth in PRCC."

The co-occurrence and timing of bladder cancer (BC) and ovarian cancer (OC) in females harboring OC germline mutations remain unclear. Our objective was to determine the frequency and temporal occurrence of OC germline variants among females with BC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We used genetic and phenotypic data from the UK Biobank (UKB). The study cohort was defined using ICD-10/ICD-9 codes for BC and further stratified to identify 1347 females. Analysis was restricted to variants with high/moderate impact for initial regression. ClinVar was used to interpret pathogenicity. Pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants were assessed by age of presentation, family history, and concomitant malignancies. Statistical analysis was performed using UKB DNAnexus JupyterLab and RStudio.\n    \n\n\n          Key findings and limitations:\n        \n      \n      Some 3.4% of the patients had at least one of 15 variants for OC. CHEK2 and PALB2 mutations represented the highest ratio of overall/pathogenic variants (15.8% and 6.6%). Although females with P/LP OC mutations had a higher risk of OC, diagnosis of OC preceded BC by 11.3 yr (±12.5 yr) in the group with mutations and by 15.6 yr (±11.3 yr) in the group without mutations. The group with P/LP variants had higher rates of maternal (14.63% vs 8.12%; p = 0.04) and sibling (9.76% vs 3.98%; p = 0.02) breast cancer and of maternal colon cancer (9.76% vs 4.21%), and lower maternal life expectancy (75.34 vs 68.15 yr; p = 0.0014). UKB provides limited staging/treatment history and its exome sequencing platform may miss variants or provide insufficient coverage for genotyping.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and clinical implications:\n        \n      \n      This study provides evidence against routine oophorectomy for reducing OC risk in females with BC. The results highlight that the development of OC occurred 11 yr before diagnosis of BC for patients with OC mutations and 15 yr before diagnosis of BC for patients without OC mutations.\n    \n\n\n          Patient summary:\n        \n      \n      Although removal of the ovaries in women with bladder cancer is common, no studies have shown that this strategy has a benefit. Our study of women diagnosed with bladder cancer who had genetic mutations associated with ovarian cancer shows that their risk of developing ovarian cancer after bladder cancer is low. These findings provide evidence against removal of the ovaries when the bladder is being removed as treatment for bladder cancer."

Existing automated methods of prostate cancer detection mostly rely on ground truth labels with limited accuracy, ignore disease pathology characteristics observed on resected tissue, and cannot selectively identify aggressive (Gleason Pattern≥4) and indolent (Gleason Pattern=3) cancers when they co-exist in mixed lesions. In this paper, we present a radiology-pathology fusion approach, CorrSigNIA, for the selective identification and localization of indolent and aggressive prostate cancer on MRI. CorrSigNIA uses registered MRI and whole-mount histopathology images from radical prostatectomy patients to derive accurate ground truth labels and learn correlated features between radiology and pathology images. These correlated features are then used in a convolutional neural network architecture to detect and localize normal tissue, indolent cancer, and aggressive cancer on prostate MRI. CorrSigNIA was trained and validated on a dataset of 98 men, including 74 men that underwent radical prostatectomy and 24 men with normal prostate MRI. CorrSigNIA was tested on three independent test sets including 55 men that underwent radical prostatectomy, 275 men that underwent targeted biopsies, and 15 men with normal prostate MRI. CorrSigNIA achieved an accuracy of 80% in distinguishing between men with and without cancer, a lesion-level ROC-AUC of 0.81±0.31 in detecting cancers in both radical prostatectomy and biopsy cohort patients, and lesion-levels ROC-AUCs of 0.82±0.31 and 0.86±0.26 in detecting clinically significant cancers in radical prostatectomy and biopsy cohort patients respectively. CorrSigNIA consistently outperformed other methods across different evaluation metrics and cohorts. In clinical settings, CorrSigNIA may be used in prostate cancer detection as well as in selective identification of indolent and aggressive components of prostate cancer, thereby improving prostate cancer care by helping guide targeted biopsies, reducing unnecessary biopsies, and selecting and planning treatment."

Namely, in the presence of HLA-G or ILT4, the levels of VEGF-A are diminished whereas those of VEGF-C are increased.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In an effort to find new therapeutic molecules and fight against metastasis dissemination associated with the poor survival rates of ccRCC patients, these findings provide the rationale for co-targeting angiogenesis and the immune checkpoint HLA-G."

The proposed method combines the deep leaning-based image synthesis method, which generates magnetic resonance images (MRIs) with superior soft-tissue contrast from on-board setup CBCT images to aid CBCT segmentation, with a deep attention strategy, which focuses on learning discriminative features for differentiating organ margins. The whole segmentation method consists of 3 major steps. First, a cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) was used to estimate a synthetic MRI (sMRI) from CBCT images. Second, a deep attention network was trained based on sMRI and its corresponding manual contours. Third, the segmented contours for a query patient was obtained by feeding the patient's CBCT images into the trained sMRI estimation and segmentation model. In our retrospective study, we included 100 prostate cancer patients, each of whom has CBCT acquired with prostate, bladder and rectum contoured by physicians with MRI guidance as ground truth. We trained and tested our model with separate datasets among these patients. The resulting segmentations were compared with physicians' manual contours. The Dice similarity coefficient and mean surface distance indices between our segmented and physicians' manual contours (bladder, prostate, and rectum) were 0.95 ± 0.02, 0.44 ± 0.22 mm, 0.86 ± 0.06, 0.73 ± 0.37 mm, and 0.91 ± 0.04, 0.72 ± 0.65 mm, respectively. We have proposed a novel CBCT-only pelvic multi-organ segmentation strategy using CBCT-based sMRI and validated its accuracy against manual contours. This technique could provide accurate organ volume for treatment planning without requiring MR images acquisition, greatly facilitating routine clinical workflow."

A risk model was built to stratify low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. An image-defined risk factor (IDRFs) model was developed to classify 266 patients with malignant PNTs and one or more IDRFs into high-risk and non-high-risk groups. The performance of the predictive models was evaluated with respect to accuracy (Acc) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, including the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The risk model demonstrated good discrimination capability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.903 to distinguish high-risk from non-high-risk groups, and 0.747 to classify intermediate- and low-risk groups. In the IDRF-based risk model with the number of IDRFs, the AUC was 0.876 for classifying the high-risk and non-high-risk groups. Radiomic analysis based on preoperative CT images has the potential to stratify the risk of pediatric malignant PNTs. It had outstanding efficiency in distinguishing patients in the high-risk group, and this predictive model of risk stratification could assist in selecting optimal aggressive treatment options."

The factors linking ASB with MDR bacteria were: advanced age (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.06) and hospitalization within the 3-month period before surgery (odds ratio, 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.21).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Bacterial resistance is frequent among patients with ASB and planned urological procedures. Advanced age and prior hospitalization should be borne in mind for patients with planned urological procedures because they are factors associated with the presence of MDR bacteria."

            "abstract": "Sipuleucel-T is an autologous cellular immunotherapy that targets prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and is available for treatment of men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In this single-arm, two-cohort, multicenter clinical study, potential racial differences in immune responses to sipuleucel-T in men with mCRPC were explored. Patients' blood samples were obtained to assess serum cytokines, humoral responses, and cellular immunity markers before and after treatment. Baseline cumulative product parameters (total nucleated and CD54+ cell counts and CD54 upregulation) were evaluated. IgM titers against the immunogen PA2024, the target antigen PAP, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were quantified by ELISA. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity was determined by ELISpots, and cytokine and chemokine concentrations were determined by Luminex.Twenty-nine African American (AA) men and 28 non-African American (non-AA) men with mCRPC received sipuleucel-T. Baseline total nucleated cell count, CD54+ cell count, CD54 expression, and cumulative product parameters were higher in non-AA men. Although PSA baseline levels were higher in AA men, there were no racial differences in IgM antibody and IFNγ ELISpots responses against PA2024, PAP, PSA, and PSMA before and after treatment. Expression of co-stimulatory receptor ICOS on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and the levels of Th1 cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and chemokines CCL4 and CCL5, were significantly higher in AA men before and/or after treatment. Despite no difference in the overall survival, PSA changes from baseline were significantly different between the two races. The data suggest that immune correlates in blood differ in AA and non-AA men with mCRPC pre- and post-sipuleucel-T.\n    \n\n\n          Significance:\n        \n      \n      Our novel findings of higher expression of co-stimulatory receptor ICOS on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in African American patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) prior and post-sipuleucel-T suggest activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The data indicate that racial differences observed in these and other immune correlates before and after sipuleucel-T warrant additional investigation to further our understanding of the immune system in African American men and other men with mCRPC."

Herein, we developed a multitarget urine tumor DNA test, UI-Seek, for UC detection and evaluated its clinical feasibility. The prediction model was developed in a retrospective cohort (n = 382), integrating assays for FGFR3 and TERT mutations and aberrant ONECUT2 and VIM methylation to generate a UC-score. The test performance was validated in a double-blinded, multicenter, prospective trial (n = 947; ChiCTR2300076543) and demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.37% and a specificity of 95.09%. The sensitivity reached 75.81% for low-grade Ta tumors and exceeded 93% in high-grade Ta and higher stages (T1 to T4). Simultaneous identification of both bladder and upper urinary tract tumors was enabled with sensitivities exceeding 90%. No significant confounding effects were observed regarding benign urological diseases or non-UC malignancies. The test showed improved sensitivities over urine cytology, the NMP22 test, and UroVysion FISH alongside comparable specificities. The single-target accuracy was greater than 98% as confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Post-surgery UC-score decreased in 97.7% of subjects. Overall, UI-Seek demonstrated robust performance and considerable potential for the early detection of UC."

            "abstract": "An ongoing prospective study is acquiring preoperative imaging data for men with prostate cancer (PCa) using the molecular imaging agent [18F]-DCFPyL targeted against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). To date, six men (of a planned accrual of 24) with clinically localized, biopsy-proven PCa have undergone preoperative [18F]-DCFPyL positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging acquired using a hybrid PET/MRI system. Lesions identified by [18F]-DCFPyL uptake on PET/MRI were characterized in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and volume using a boundary threshold of 40% SUVmax. Following surgery, all prostatectomy specimens were processed using a whole-mount technique for accurate deformable co-registration and correlation with PCa foci defined on digitized pathology images. Well-defined intraprostatic dominant lesions were identified by [18F]-DCFPyL PET/MRI (mean SUVmax 11.4±8.25; mean volume 2.2±2.4cm3) in all six men. Co-registered digitized whole-mount pathology for the first case revealed that intense [18F]-DCFPyL uptake (SUVmax 27±1.1cm3) and multiparametric MRI changes (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score of 4) were highly correlated with a 0.5-cm3 dominant (largest) lesion with Gleason pattern 4 PCa in the right mid peripheral zone. A smaller focus (0.01cm3) of lower-grade PCa (Gleason pattern 3) had much lower uptake (SUV 2.7). These early prospective data show that dominant intraprostatic lesions could be identified in all six men using [18F]-DCFPyL as an imaging probe. Trial accrual will continue to quantify in terms of spatial concordance the ability of [18F]-DCFPyL to identify the location and characterize the grade of intraprostatic cancer foci in clinically localized PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: Positron emission tomography using a novel probe called [18F]-DCFPyL directed against the prostate-specific membrane antigen protein was able to identify locations of prostate cancer in the prostate glands of men undergoing imaging before surgery. In the future, such imaging may allow better targeting of treatment to the portion of the prostate containing the most aggressive components of cancer rather than treating the whole prostate in a uniform fashion."

Methods: A total of 238 oldest-old (≥75 years old) colon cancer patients who received surgical treatment in Gastrointestinal Surgery Department of Beijing Hospital from December 2010 to December 2020 were retrospectively collected. They were divided into right-side hemicolectomy (RCC) group (130 cases) and left-side hemicolectomy (LCC) group (108 cases) by surgical methods. The difference in postoperative short-term complications and long-term prognosis was compared between the two groups, and the related factors of postoperative death was analyzed using multivariate Cox regression model. Results: The age of 238 oldest-old patients with colon cancer ranged from 75 to 93 years old (80.5±3.7). There were 128 males and 110 females. The ages of patients in the LCC group and RCC group were (80.4±3.7) and (80.6±3.7) years old (P=0.699), respectively. There was no significant difference in gender, body mass index (BMI) and co-existing chronic diseases between two groups (P>0.05). The proportion of the duration of surgery exceeding 170 min in the LCC group was significantly higher than that in the RCC group (56.5% vs 43.1%, P=0.039). The incidence of postoperative short-term complications in RCC group was slightly higher than LCC group (P>0.05), and there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS), tumor-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between two groups.

Patients underwent a screening PSMA and FDG-PET/CT to confirm high PSMA-expression. Eligible patients had progressive disease defined by imaging (according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours [RECIST] or bone scan) or new pain in an area of radiographically evident disease, and were required to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 2 or lower. Eligible patients received up to four cycles of intravenous [177Lu]-PSMA-617, at six weekly intervals. The primary endpoint was PSA response according to Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group criteria defined as a greater than 50% PSA decline from baseline and toxicity according to CTCAE. Additional primary endpoints were imaging responses (as measured by bone scan, CT, PSMA, and FDG PET/CT) and quality of life (assessed with the EORTC-Q30 and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form questionnaires), all measured up to 3 months post completion of treatment.

Despite attempts to bridge the disparities gap, there remains an unmet need to expand minority engagement and participation in clinical trials to better define the impact of therapy on efficacy outcomes, quality of life, and role of biomarkers in diverse patient populations. The IRONMAN registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03151629), a global, prospective, population-based study, was borne from this unmet medical need to address persistent gaps in our knowledge of advanced prostate cancer. Through integrated collection of clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, epidemiologic data, and biospecimens, IRONMAN has the goal of expanding our understanding of how and why prostate cancer outcomes differ by race and ethnicity. To this end, the Diversity Working Group of the IRONMAN registry has developed informed strategies for site selection, recruitment, engagement and retention, and trial design and eligibility criteria to ensure broad inclusion and needs awareness of minority participants.

The RCCBaSe was created linking all cases, controls and first-degree relatives to a number of national registers with information on co-morbidity, socioeconomic factors and pharmaceutical prescriptions.Results: Between 2005 and 2014, a total of 9,416 patients with RCC were reported to the NSKCR. 94,159 controls and a total cohort of 575,007 individuals including cases, controls and first-degree relatives were identified. Linkage to the Swedish cancer register resulted in 106,772 matches. When linked to the National patient register, 432,677 out-patient and 471,359 in-patient matches were generated. When linked to the Swedish renal registry 1,778 matches were generated. Linkage to the Prescribed drug register resulted in 448,084 matches and linkage to the The Longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labour market studies database resulted in 450,017 matches.Conclusion: By linking the NSKCR to several Swedish national databases, a unique database for RCC research has been created."

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nVehicle engine exhaust includes ultrafine particles with a large surface area and containing absorbed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, transition metals and other substances. Ultrafine particles and soluble chemicals can be transported from the airways to other organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and brain. Our aim was to investigate whether air pollution from traffic is associated with risk for other cancers than lung cancer.\n## METHODS\nWe followed up 54,304 participants in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort for 20 selected cancers in the Danish Cancer Registry, from enrolment in 1993-1997 until 2006, and traced their residential addresses from 1971 onwards in the Central Population Registry. We used modeled concentration of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) and amount of traffic at the residence as indicators of traffic-related air pollution and used Cox models to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) after adjustment for potential confounders.\n## RESULTS\nNO(x) at the residence was significantly associated with risks for cervical cancer (IRR, 2.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01;5.93, per 100 μg/m(3) NO(x)) and brain cancer (IRR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.25;4.19, per 100 μg/m(3) NO(x)).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThis hypothesis-generating study indicates that traffic-related air pollution might increase the risks for cervical and brain cancer, which should be tested in future studies.\n"

Paid time off and flexible work schedules were work accommodations reported by 52.6% and 36.3% of survivors, respectively. In an adjusted regression analysis, household income was positively associated with having received a work accommodation. From the qualitative component of the study (survivors n = 17; caregivers n = 11), three key themes emerged: work disruptions, work accommodations, and coping mechanisms to address the disruptions. Survivors and caregivers shared concerns about lack of support at work and resources to navigate issues caused by changes in employment.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study characterized employment changes among a diverse group of cancer survivors.

The ih-CD40 represents a modified chimeric version of the dendritic cell (DC) co-stimulatory molecule, CD40, which responds to a bioinert membrane-permeable activating dimerizer drug, rimiducid (AP1903), permitting temporally controlled, lymphoid-localized, DC-specific activation. Eighteen men with progressive mCRPC following ≤1 prior chemotherapy regimen were enrolled to evaluate three doses of BPX101 (4 × 106, 12.5 × 106 and 25 × 106 cells) administered intradermally every 2-4 weeks followed by rimiducid (0.4 mg/kg) intravenous (IV) infusion 24 h after each BPX101 dose. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. Immune upregulation as well as anti-tumor activity was observed with PSA declines, objective tumor regressions and robust efficacy of post-trial therapy.

By resolving the patterns of driver event ordering, co-occurrence, and mutual exclusivity at clone level, we show the deterministic nature of clonal evolution. ccRCC can be grouped into seven evolutionary subtypes, ranging from tumors characterized by early fixation of multiple mutational and copy number drivers and rapid metastases to highly branched tumors with >10 subclonal drivers and extensive parallel evolution associated with attenuated progression. We identify genetic diversity and chromosomal complexity as determinants of patient outcome.

Patients & methods: 162 UC specimens were evaluated for PD-L1 expression on TIIC and TC with the SP263 assay. High PD-L1 expression was defined as ≥25% staining. Results: High PD-L1 expression on TC in UC patients with stage T1-4 disease was associated with poor overall survival. However, high PD-L1 expression on TIIC in UC patients with stage T1-4 disease revealed favorable disease-free and overall survival; more significant differences were observed in patients with stages T2-4. Multivariate analysis revealed that high PD-L1 expression on TIIC was an independent prognostic predictor for better disease-free and overall survival. Conclusion: High PD-L1 expression on TIIC, but not on TC, is a favorable prognostic factor in UC."

Data on all eligible bladder cancer deaths were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted of people who died from causes other than cancer or diseases associated with genitourinary problems. The controls were pair matched to the cases by sex, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case. Classification of exposure to municipality air pollution was based on the measured levels of nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. The results of the present study show that there is a significant positive association between the levels of air pollution and bladder cancer mortality. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.37 (1.03-1.82) for the group with medium air pollution level and 1.98 (1.36-2.88) for the group with high air pollution level when compared to the group with the low air pollution level. Trend analyses showed statistically significant trend in risk of death from bladder cancer with increasing air pollution level. The findings of this study warrant further investigation of the role of air pollutants in the etiology of bladder cancer.\n"

Here, we examined familial prostate tumors for novel CNVs as prior studies suggest these harbor distinct CNVs. Array comparative genomic hybridization of 12 tumors from an Australian PrCa family, PcTas9, highlighted multiple recurrent CNVs, including amplification of EEF2 (19p13.3) in 100% of tumors. The EEF2 CNV was examined in a further 26 familial and seven sporadic tumors from the Australian cohort and in 494 tumors unselected for family history from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). EEF2 overexpression was observed in seven PcTas9 tumors, in addition to seven other predominantly familial tumors (ntotal = 34%). EEF2 amplification was only observed in 1.4% of TCGA tumors, however 7.5% harbored an EEF2 deletion. Analysis of genes co-expressed with EEF2 revealed significant upregulation of two genes, ZNF74 and ADSL, and downregulation of PLSCR1 in both EEF2 amplified familial tumors and EEF2 deleted TCGA tumors. Furthermore, in TCGA tumors, EEF2 amplification and deletion were significantly associated with a higher Gleason score. In summary, we identified a novel PrCa CNV that was predominantly amplified in familial tumors and deleted in unselected tumors. Our results provide further evidence that familial tumors harbor distinct CNVs, potentially due to an inherited predisposition, but also suggest that regardless of how EEF2 is dysregulated, a similar set of genes involved in key cancer pathways are impacted. Given the current lack of gene-based biomarkers and clinical targets in PrCa, further investigation of EEF2 is warranted."

In this progression, Bmi-1 protein was regulated by transcription and post-translational modifications (PTMs). Nobly, the underlying PTMs regulation of Bmi-1 is poorly known. Here we use co-immunoprecipitation show that in C4-2 cell line, Bmi-1 directly interacted with OGT which is the only known enzyme catalyzed the O-GlcNAcylation in human. Furthermore, we identified that Ser255 is the site for Bmi-1 O-GlcNAcylation, and O-GlcNAcylation promoted Bmi-1 protein stability and its oncogenic activity. Finally, microarray analysis has characterized potential oncogenes associated pathway subject to repression via the OGT-Bmi-1 axis. Taken together, these results indicate that OGT-mediated O-GlcNAcylation at Ser255 stabilizes Bmi-1 and hence inhibits the TP53, PTEN and CDKN1A/CDKN2A pathway. The study not only uncovers a novel functional PTMs of Bmi-1 but also reveals a unique oncogenic role of O-GlcNAcylation in prostate cancer."

Subsequently, comparing the immune-related characteristics between the two metabolic subtypes to describe the immunological difference. Then, the Scissor algorithm was applied to link the metabolic phenotypes and single-cell transcriptome datasets to determine the biomarkers associated with metabolic subtypes and prognosis.

MRS1 BLCAs preferred to be immuno-suppressive and up-regulated immune checkpoints expression, suggesting the well-therapeutic response of MRS1 patients to immunotherapy. Based on the Scissor algorithm, we found that S100A7 both specifically up-regulated in the MRS1 phenotype and MRS1-tumor cells, and positively correlated with immunological characteristics. In addition, in the clinical cohort included 63 BLCA and 16 para-cancerous samples, S100A7 was obviously associated with poor prognosis and enhanced PD-L1 expression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The metabolic subtype with S100A7 high expression recognizes the immuno-suppressive tumor microenvironment and predicts well therapeutic response of immunotherapy in BLCA.

No significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between the groups. The median time from surgery to adjuvant chemotherapy was 1.9 mo for both RARC and ORC groups. The median number of lymph nodes removed was 21 (interquartile range [IQR] 14-35) for RARC and 13 (IQR 8-21) for ORC (p<0.001); the results were confirmed in subgroup analyses. Multivariable analyses revealed no difference in the rate of positive surgical margins (p=0.54 and p=0.78), rate of neobladder diversion (p=0.33 and p=0.51), relapse-free survival (p=0.31 and p=0.23), and overall survival (p=0.63 and p=0.69).

            "abstract": "Air pollution exposure has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of specific cancers. This study investigated whether the number and incidence of the most common cancers in Saudi Arabia were associated with urban air pollution exposure, specifically NO2. Overall, high model goodness of fit (GOF) was observed in the Eastern, Riyadh and Makkah regions. The significant coefficients of determination (r2) were higher at the regional level (r2 = 0.32-0.71), weaker at the governorate level (r2 = 0.03-0.43), and declined slightly at the city level (r2 = 0.17-0.33), suggesting that an increased aggregated spatial level increased the explained variability and the model GOF. However, the low GOF at the lowest spatial level suggests that additional variation remains unexplained. At different spatial levels, associations between NO2 concentration and the most common cancers were marginally improved in geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, which explained both global and local heterogeneity and variations in cancer incidence. High coefficients of determination were observed between NO2 concentration and lung and breast cancer incidences, followed by prostate, bladder, cervical and ovarian cancers, confirming results from other studies. These results could be improved using individual explanatory variables such as environmental, demographic, behavioral, socio-economic, and genetic risk factors.\n"

Rather, the risk of death depends on both the baseline risk of mortality and the time survived since treatment. We therefore evaluated the conditional survival of patients diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) following radical cystectomy (RC).\n    \n\n\n          Patients and methods:\n        \n      \n      We identified patients aged 18 to 75 with Charlson 0-1 and pTany pN0-3 cM0 UCB diagnosed from 2006 to 2015 in the National Cancer Database and treated with RC. The 2- and 5-year conditional overall survival (COS)-i.e., the probability of surviving an additional 2- or 5-years given a specified time survived since treatment-was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable Cox regression models with landmark time analysis were used to evaluate the associations of baseline characteristics with OS over time.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 15,594 patients were included in the study.

Recently, higher rates of cancer incidence were observed among myocardial infarction survivors compared with the general population. We examined the association between chronic exposure to nitrogen oxides, a proxy measure for traffic-related air pollution, and cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of myocardial infarction patients.\n## METHODS\nPatients aged ≤65 years admitted to hospital in central Israel with a first myocardial infarction in 1992-1993 were followed to 2013 for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality. Data on sociodemographic and cancer risk factors were obtained, including time-varying information on smoking. Using land use regression models, annual averages of nitrogen oxides during follow-up were estimated individually according to home addresses. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to study the relationships with cancer outcomes.\n## RESULTS\nDuring a mean follow-up of 16 (SD 7) years, 262 incident cancers and 105 cancer deaths were identified among 1393 cancer-free patients at baseline (mean age 54 years; 81% men). In adjusted models, a 10 ppb increase in mean nitrogen oxide exposure was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96-1.18) for cancer incidence and HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.93-1.26) for cancer mortality. The association with lung, bladder, kidney or prostate cancer (previously linked to air pollution) was stronger (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00-1.33).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nChronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution may constitute an environmental risk factor for cancer post-myocardial infarction. Variation in the strength of association between specific cancers needs to be explored further.\n"

The proto-oncogene RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) has emerged as a putative modulator of chemotherapy response in several solid tumours but has a hitherto unrecognized role in MIBC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      RBM3 protein expression level in tumour cells was assessed via immunohistochemistry in paired transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) specimens, cystectomy specimens and lymph node metastases from a consecutive cohort of 145 patients, 65 of whom were treated with NAC. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to estimate the impact of RBM3 expression on time to recurrence (TTR), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in strata according to NAC treatment. The effect of siRNA-mediated silencing of RBM3 on chemosensitivity was examined in RT4 and T24 human bladder carcinoma cells in vitro. Cellular functions of RBM3 were assessed using RNA-sequencing and gene ontology analysis, followed by investigation of cell cycle distribution using flow cytometry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      RBM3 protein expression was significantly higher in TURB compared to cystectomy specimens but showed consistency between primary tumours and lymph node metastases. Patients with high-tumour specific RBM3 expression treated with NAC had a significantly reduced risk of recurrence and a prolonged CSS and OS compared to NAC-untreated patients. In high-grade T24 carcinoma cells, which expressed higher RBM3 mRNA levels compared to RT4 cells, RBM3 silencing conferred a decreased sensitivity to cisplatin and gemcitabine. Transcriptomic analysis revealed potential involvement of RBM3 in facilitating cell cycle progression, in particular G1/S-phase transition, and initiation of DNA replication. Furthermore, siRBM3-transfected T24 cells displayed an accumulation of cells residing in the G1-phase as well as altered levels of recognised regulators of G1-phase progression, including Cyclin D1/CDK4 and CDK2.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The presented data highlight the potential value of RBM3 as a predictive biomarker of chemotherapy response in MIBC, which could, if prospectively validated, improve treatment stratification of patients with this aggressive disease."

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and non-negative matrix factorization were used to cluster patients and to screen genes that play a vital role in PCa progression (hub gene). Immunohistochemistry staining was used to evaluate the protein level of UBE2C in prostatic tissues. Through WGCNA, we found a gene co-expression module (named the purple module) that is strongly associated with the Gleason score, pathologic T stage, and biochemical recurrent status. Genes in the purple module are enriched in cell cycle and P53 signaling and help us to cluster patients into two groups with distinctive biochemical recurrent survival rates and TP53 mutation statuses. Further analysis showed UBE2C served as a hub gene in the purple module. The expression of UBE2C in PCa was significantly higher than that in paracancerous tissues and was remarkably associated with pathologic grade, Gleason score, and prognosis in PCa patients. To conclude, UBE2C is a PCa-progress-related gene and a biomarker for PCa patients. Therapy targeting UBE2C may serve as a promising treatment of PCa in the future."

            "abstract": "Molecular programs involved in embryogenesis are frequently upregulated in oncogenic dedifferentiation and metastasis. However, their precise roles and regulatory mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we showed that CDK1 phosphorylation of TFCP2L1, a pluripotency-associated transcription factor, orchestrated pluripotency and cell-cycling in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and was aberrantly activated in aggressive bladder cancers (BCs). In murine ESCs, the protein interactome and transcription targets of Tfcp2l1 indicated its involvement in cell cycle regulation. Tfcp2l1 was phosphorylated at Thr177 by Cdk1, which affected ESC cell cycle progression, pluripotency, and differentiation. The CDK1-TFCP2L1 pathway was activated in human BC cells, stimulating their proliferation, self-renewal, and invasion. Lack of TFCP2L1 phosphorylation impaired the tumorigenic potency of BC cells in a xenograft model. In patients with BC, high co-expression of TFCP2L1 and CDK1 was associated with unfavorable clinical characteristics including tumor grade, lymphovascular and muscularis propria invasion, and distant metastasis and was an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival. These findings demonstrate the molecular and clinical significance of CDK1-mediated TFCP2L1 phosphorylation in stem cell pluripotency and in the tumorigenic stemness features associated with BC progression."

The utLIFE-UC model could discriminate 92.8% of UCs with 96.0% specificity and was robustly validated in the BLCA_TCGA and UTUC cohorts. Furthermore, compared to cytology, utLIFE-UC improved the sensitivity of bladder cancer detection (p < 0.01).

The staining characteristics were identified and evaluated for associations with clinicopathologic parameters, PSA recurrence survival, and prostate cancer-specific morality.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The expressions of ATF6α, PERK, and IRE1α were significantly associated with Gleason grade, PSA level, T stages and M stage, while this association was not significant in N stage. Additionally, UPR signaling factors expressed correlatively with each other. In further studies, high expression level of UPR signaling factors was usually detected in patients who suffered poor prognosis. Patients with positive UPR signaling factors meet shorter survival duration both on cancer-specific morality and PSA recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed that IRE1α (HR = 4.461 95%CI = 1.270-15.670 P = 0.020) could be a potential factor in predicting PSA recurrence independently.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      UPR signaling factors were co-activated and activation of UPR signaling was implicated to the malignant progression and worse prognosis of PCa.

Exposure to benzene, toluene and xylene often co-occur. Therefore, we created two additional sets of metrics for combined benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) exposure: (1) CANJEM-based BTX metrics and (2) hybrid BTX metrics, using an approach that integrates the CANJEM-based BTX metrics together with lifetime occupational histories and exposure-oriented modules that captured within-job, respondent-specific details about tasks and chemicals. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using logistic regression.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Bladder cancer risks were increased among those ever exposed to benzene (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.14-2.32), toluene (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06-2.43), and xylene (OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13-2.48) individually. We further observed a statistically significant exposure-response relationship for cumulative BTX exposure, with a stronger association using the hybrid BTX metrics (ORQ1vsUnexposed = 1.26, 95% CI: 0.83-1.90; ORQ2vsUnexposed = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.00-2.31; ORQ3vsUnexposed = 1.88, 95% CI: 1.24-2.85; and ORQ4vsUnexposed = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.35-3.69) (p-trend=0.001) than using CANJEM-based metrics (p-trend=0.02).\n    \n\n\n          Impact:\n        \n      \n      There is limited evidence about the role of exposure to specific organic solvents, alone or in combination on the risk of developing bladder cancer. In this study, workers with increasing exposure to benzene, toluene, and xylene as a group (BTX) had a statistically significant exposure-response relationship with bladder cancer. Future evaluation of the carcinogenicity of BTX and other organic solvents, particularly concurrent exposure, on bladder cancer development is needed."

            "abstract": "HOXB13 is a key lineage homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in the differentiation of the prostate gland. Several studies have suggested that HOXB13 alterations may be involved in prostate cancer development and progression. Despite its potential biological relevance, little is known about the expression of HOXB13 across the disease spectrum of prostate cancer. To this end, we validated a HOXB13 antibody using genetic controls and investigated HOXB13 protein expression in murine and human developing prostates, localized prostate cancers, and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers. We observed that HOXB13 expression increases during later stages of murine prostate development. All localized prostate cancers showed HOXB13 protein expression. Interestingly, lower HOXB13 expression levels were observed in higher-grade tumors, although no significant association between HOXB13 expression and recurrence or disease-specific survival was found. In advanced metastatic prostate cancers, HOXB13 expression was retained in the majority of tumors. While we observed lower levels of HOXB13 protein and mRNA levels in tumors with evidence of lineage plasticity, 84% of androgen receptor-negative castration-resistant prostate cancers and neuroendocrine prostate cancers (NEPCs) retained detectable levels of HOXB13. Notably, the reduced expression observed in NEPCs was associated with a gain of HOXB13 gene body CpG methylation. In comparison to the commonly used prostate lineage marker NKX3.1, HOXB13 showed greater sensitivity in detecting advanced metastatic prostate cancers. Additionally, in a cohort of 837 patients, 383 with prostatic and 454 with non-prostatic tumors, we found that HOXB13 immunohistochemistry had a 97% sensitivity and 99% specificity for prostatic origin. Taken together, our studies provide valuable insight into the expression pattern of HOXB13 during prostate development and cancer progression. Furthermore, our findings support the utility of HOXB13 as a diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer, particularly to confirm the prostatic origin of advanced metastatic castration-resistant tumors. © 2023 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland."

            "abstract": "S100 calcium binding protein A16 (S100A16) is expressed in various cancers; however, there are few reports on S100A16 in bladder cancer (BC). We retrospectively investigated clinical data including clinicopathological features in 121 patients with BC who underwent radical cystectomy (RC). Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate S100A16 expression in archived specimens. Cases with >5% expression and more than moderate staining intensity on cancer cells were considered positive. S100A16 expression was observed in 54 patients (44.6%). Univariate analysis showed that S100A16 expression was significantly associated with age, pT stage, recurrence, and cancer-specific death. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that patients with S100A16 expression had shorter overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) than those without S100A16 expression. In multivariate analysis, pT stage was an independent prognostic factor for OS and lymph node metastasis for CSS and RFS. S100A16 expression may be a biomarker of a biologically aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in patients with BC who underwent RC. The PI3k/Akt signaling pathway is probably associated with S100A16 and may be a therapeutic target."

We conducted a prospective, phase I trial of neoadjuvant nivolumab prior to nephrectomy in 15 evaluable patients with non-metastatic ccRCC. We leveraged tissue from that cohort to elucidate the effects of PD-1 inhibition on immune cell populations in ccRCC and correlate the evolving immune milieu with anti-PD-1 response. We found that nivolumab durably induces a pro-inflammatory state within the primary tumor, and baseline immune infiltration within the primary tumor correlates with nivolumab responsiveness. Nivolumab increases CTLA-4 expression in the primary tumor, and subsequent nephrectomy increases circulating concentrations of sPD-L1, sPD-L3 (sB7-H3), and s4-1BB. These findings form the basis to consider neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for high-risk ccRCC while the tumor remains in situ and provide the rationale for perioperative strategies of novel ICI combinations."

Other CV baseline risk factors and serum cardiac biomarkers were not significantly predictive for MACE, although a trend toward an association with dyslipidemia was seen in the combination arm. No clinical value of on-treatment routine monitoring of LVEF in relation to MACE was observed. Although LVEF decline was significantly more frequent in the combination arm, most patients recovered, and decline was not associated with other significant cardiac events or symptoms.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Patients with high baseline troponin T levels receiving ICI and VEGFR combinations may need to be monitored more closely for MACE.

Several epidemiological studies have also reported a plausible role for structurally related heterocyclic aromatic amines present in tobacco smoke or formed in cooked meats with bladder cancer risk. DNA adduct formation is an initial biochemical event in bladder carcinogenesis. We examined paired fresh-frozen (FR) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nontumor bladder tissues from 41 bladder cancer patients for DNA adducts of 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), a bladder carcinogen present in tobacco smoke, and 2-amino-9 H-pyrido[2,3- b]indole, 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5- b]pyridine and 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5- f]quinoxaline, possible human carcinogens, which occur in tobacco smoke and cooked meats. These chemicals are present in urine of tobacco smokers or omnivores. Targeted DNA adduct measurements were done by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization multistage hybrid Orbitrap MS. N-(2'-Deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4-ABP ( N-(dG-C8)-4-ABP) was the sole adduct detected in FR and FFPE bladder tissues. Twelve subjects (29%) had N-(dG-C8)-4-ABP levels above the limit of quantification, ranging from 1.4 to 33.8 adducts per 109 nucleotides (nt). DNA adducts of other human AA bladder carcinogens, including 2-naphthylamine (2-NA), 2-methylaniline (2-MA), 2,6-dimethylaniline (2,6-DMA), and lipid peroxidation (LPO) adducts, were screened for in bladder tissue, by our untargeted data-independent adductomics method, termed wide-selected ion monitoring (wide-SIM)/MS2. Wide-SIM/MS2 successfully detected N-(dG-C8)-4-ABP, N-(2'-deoxyadenosin-8-yl)-4-ABP and the presumed hydrazo linked adduct, N-(2'-deoxyguanosin- N2-yl)-4-ABP, and several LPO adducts in bladder DNA. Wide-SIM/MS2 detected multiple DNA adducts of 2-NA, 2-MA, and, 2,6-DMA, when calf thymus DNA was modified with reactive intermediates of these carcinogens. However, these AA-adducts were below the limit of detection in unspiked human bladder DNA (<1 adduct per 108 nt). Wide-SIM/MS2 can screen for many types of DNA adducts formed with exogenous and endogenous electrophiles and will be employed to identify DNA adducts of other chemicals that may contribute to the etiology of bladder cancer."

            "abstract": "Rationale: Bladder cancer (BC) management demands the introduction of novel molecular targets for precision medicine. Cell surface glycoprotein CD44 has been widely studied as a potential biomarker of BC aggressiveness and cancer stem cells. However, significant alternative splicing and multiple glycosylation generate a myriad of glycoproteoforms with potentially distinct functional roles. The lack of tools for precise molecular characterization has led to conflicting results, delaying clinical applications. Addressing these limitations, we have interrogated the transcriptome and glycoproteome of a large BC patient cohort for splicing signatures. Methods:CD44 gene and its splicing variants were assessed by Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and RNAseq in tumor tissues. The co-localization of CD44 and short O-glycans was evaluated by proximity ligation assay (PLA), immunohistochemistry and double-immunofluorescence. An innovative glycoproteogenomics approach, integrating transcriptomics-customized datasets and glycomics for protein annotation from nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS experiments, was developed and implemented to identify CD44 variants and associated glycosignatures. The impact of CD44 silencing on proliferation and invasion of BC cell lines and glycoengineered cells was determined by BrdU ELISA and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Antibody phosphoarrays were used to investigate the role of CD44 and its glycoforms in the activation of relevant oncogenic signaling pathways. Results: Transcriptomics analysis revealed remarkable CD44 isoforms heterogeneity in bladder cancer tissues, as well as associations between short CD44 standard splicing isoform (CD44s), invasion and poor prognosis. We further demonstrated that targeting short O-glycoforms such as the Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens was key to overcome the lack of cancer specificity presented by CD44. Glycoproteogenomics allowed, for the first time, the comprehensive characterization of CD44 splicing code at the protein level. The concept was applied to invasive human BC cell lines, glycoengineered cells, and tumor tissues, enabling unequivocal CD44s identification as well as associated glycoforms. Finally, we confirmed the link between CD44 and invasion in CD44s-enriched cells in vitro by small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown, supporting findings from BC tissues. The key role played by short-chain O-glycans in CD44-mediated invasion was also demonstrated through glycoengineered cell models. Conclusions: Overall, CD44s emerged as biomarker of poor prognosis and CD44-Tn/ Sialyl-Tn (STn) as promising molecular signatures for targeted interventions. This study materializes the concept of glycoproteogenomics and provides a key vision to address the cancer splicing code at the protein level, which may now be expanded to better understand CD44 functional role in health and disease."

Aim: To investigate the influence of occupational exposures and genetic polymorphisms on recurrence and progression of NMIBC. Methods: The study includes 160 NMIBC patients. We collected on questionnaire information on demographic variables, lifetime smoking history, lifetime history of occupational exposure to aromatic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Genetic polymorphism (glutathione S-transferase M1; T1; P1 (GSTM1; GSTT1; GSTP1); N-acetyltransferase 1; 2 (NAT1; NAT2); cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1); sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1); myeloperoxidase (MPO); catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT); manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD); NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1); X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1; 3 (XRCC1; XRCC3) and xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group (XPD)) was assessed in peripheral blood lymphocytes. DNA adducts were evaluated by 32P-postlabeling. Predictors of recurrence (histological confirmation of a newly found bladder tumor) and progression (transition of tumor from low-grade to high-grade and/or increase in TNM stage) were identified by multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression with stepwise backward selection of independent variables. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI) and two-tail probability of error (p-value) were estimated. Results: The risk of BC progression decreased with the homozygous genotype \"ValVal\" of both COMT and MnSOD (HR = 0.195; 95%CI = 0.060 to 0.623; p = 0.006). The results on BC recurrence were of borderline significance. No occupational exposure influenced recurrence or progression. Conclusion: Our results are supported by experimental evidence of a plausible mechanism between cause (ValVal genotype of both MnSOD and COMT) and effect (decreased progression of tumor in NMIBC patients). The genetic polymorphisms associated with better prognosis may be used in clinic to guide selection of treatment for patients initially diagnosed with NMIBC.

            "abstract": "Disulfidptosis is a recently identified type of programmed cell death. It is characterized by aberrant accumulation of intracellular disulfides. The clinical implications of disulfidptosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain unclear. A series of bioinformatics approaches were employed to analyze ten disulfidptosis-related molecules. Firstly, the expression patterns of the disulfidptosis-related molecules were different between normal and ccRCC tissues. A comprehensive cohort of patients with ccRCC was then assembled from three public databases and subjected to cluster analysis based on disulfidptosis-related molecules. Consensus cluster analysis revealed three distinct disulfidptosis clusters. We then conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify highly correlated genes. 267 hub genes were screened out through WGCNA, and three gene clusters were then determined. Finally, we identified 87 genes with prognostic value and then used them to develop a disulfidptosis scoring (DSscore) system, which was proven to independently predict survival in ccRCC. Patients in the high-DSscore group exhibited a significant survival advantage and better immunotherapeutic responses compared with those in the low-DSscore group. However, the patients in the low-DSscore group exhibited a greater degree of chemotherapeutic response. In addition, the expression of disulfidptosis-related molecules was validated by qRT-PCR, and the potential of disulfidptosis-related molecules to indicate distinct cell subtypes were validated by single-cell RNA-sequencing. In conclusion, DSscore is a promising index for predicting the prognosis and efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with ccRCC and may provide a basis for novel strategies for future studies."

            "abstract": "Expression levels of retinoic acid receptor gamma (NR1B3/RARG, encodes RARγ) are commonly reduced in prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore, we sought to establish the cellular and gene regulatory consequences of reduced RARγ expression, and determine RARγ regulatory mechanisms. RARG shRNA approaches in non-malignant (RWPE-1 and HPr1-AR) and malignant (LNCaP) prostate models revealed that reducing RARγ levels, rather than adding exogenous retinoid ligand, had the greatest impact on prostate cell viability and gene expression. ChIP-Seq defined the RARγ cistrome, which was significantly enriched at active enhancers associated with AR binding sites. Reflecting a significant genomic role for RARγ to regulate androgen signaling, RARγ knockdown in HPr1-AR cells significantly regulated the magnitude of the AR transcriptome. RARγ downregulation was explained by increased miR-96 in PCa cell and mouse models, and TCGA PCa cohorts. Biochemical approaches confirmed that miR-96 directly regulated RARγ expression and function. Capture of the miR-96 targetome by biotin-miR-96 identified that RARγ and a number of RARγ interacting co-factors including TACC1 were all targeted by miR-96, and expression of these genes were prominently altered, positively and negatively, in the TCGA-PRAD cohort. Differential gene expression analyses between tumors in the TCGA-PRAD cohort with lower quartile expression levels of RARG and TACC1 and upper quartile miR-96, compared to the reverse, identified a gene network including several RARγ target genes (e.g., SOX15) that significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (hazard ratio 2.23, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.88, p = 0.015). In summary, miR-96 targets a RARγ network to govern AR signaling, PCa progression and disease outcome."

We aimed to establish translatable mouse models of disseminated prostate cancer (PCa) to evaluate effectiveness of 225Ac-PSMA-617 at various disease stages. Methods: C4-2, C4-2B, or 22Rv1 cells were injected into the left ventricle of male NSG mice. Disease progression was monitored using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). For treatment, mice were injected with 40 kBq 225Ac-PSMA-617 at one (early treatment cohort) or three weeks (late treatment cohort) post-inoculation. Treatment efficacy was monitored by BLI of whole-body tumor burden. Mice were sacrificed based on body conditioning score. Results: C4-2 cells yielded metastases in liver, lungs, spleen, stomach, bones, and brain - achieving a clinically relevant model of widespread metastatic disease. The disease burden in the early treatment cohort was stable over 27 weeks in 5/9 mice and progressive in 4/9 mice. These mice were sacrificed due to brain metastases. Median survival of the late treatment cohort was superior to controls (13 vs. 7 weeks; p<0.0001) but inferior to that in the early treatment cohort (13 vs. 27 weeks; p<0.001). Late cohort mice succumbed to extensive liver involvement. The 22Rv1 and C4-2B systemic models were not used for treatment due to high kidney metastatic burden or low take rate, respectively. Conclusion: C4-2 cells reproduced metastatic cancer spread most relevantly. Early treatment with 225Ac-PSMA-617 prevented liver metastases and led to significant survival benefit. Late treatment improved survival without reducing tumor burden in the liver, the main site of metastasis. The current findings suggest that early 225Ac-PSMA-617 intervention is more efficacious in the setting of widespread metastatic PCa."

            "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an increasingly important tool for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. However, interpretation of MRI suffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby contributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk cancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly improved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer locations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had radical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth cancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration approaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the cost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet, a deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology image registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image preprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep neural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI using estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and histopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and evaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an additional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that our deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and is at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm. This important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate MRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate cancer on MRI.

A subset of castration resistant prostate cancers become androgen receptor (AR) signaling-independent and develop neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) features through lineage plasticity. These NEPC tumors, associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis, are driven, in part, by aberrant expression of N-Myc, through mechanisms that remain unclear. Integrative analysis of the N-Myc transcriptome, cistrome and interactome using in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo models (including patient-derived organoids) identified a lineage switch towards a neural identity associated with epigenetic reprogramming. N-Myc and known AR-co-factors (e.g., FOXA1 and HOXB13) overlapped, independently of AR, at genomic loci implicated in neural lineage specification. Moreover, histone marks specifically associated with lineage-defining genes were reprogrammed by N-Myc. We also demonstrated that the N-Myc-induced molecular program accurately classifies our cohort of patients with advanced prostate cancer. Finally, we revealed the potential for EZH2 inhibition to reverse the N-Myc-induced suppression of epithelial lineage genes. Altogether, our data provide insights on how N-Myc regulates lineage plasticity and epigenetic reprogramming associated with lineage-specification. The N-Myc signature we defined could also help predict the evolution of prostate cancer and thus better guide the choice of future therapeutic strategies."

Nonetheless, several of the associations remain controversial. Moreover, our understanding of the possible interaction between the local environment and the genetic variability is still very limited.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      The aim of this study was to clarify the role of the local environment and its possible interplay with genetics on common cancers development.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Using the UK Biobank (UKBB) prospective cohort, we selected 12 local environment exposures: nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxides, particulate matter (10 and 2.5 μm), noise pollution, urban traffic, living distance from the coast, percentage of greenspace, natural environment, water, and domestic garden within 1000 m from the residential coordinates of each participant. All these exposures were tested for association with 17 different types of cancer for a total of 53,270 cases and 302,645 controls. Additionally, a polygenic score (PGS) was computed for each cancer, to test possible gene-environment interactions. Finally, mediation analyses were carried out.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six statistically significant associations considering multiple testing (p < 2.19 × 10-4) were observed. Among the novel associations we observed that individuals living farther from the coast had a higher risk of developing prostate cancer (OR = 1.13, CI95% = 1.06-1.20, P = 1.98 × 10-4). This association was partially mediated by physical activity (indirect effect (IE) = -8.48 × 10-7) and the time spent outdoor (IE = 9.07 × 10-6). All PGSs showed statistically significant associations. Finally, genome-environment interaction analysis showed that local environment and genetic variability affect cancer risk independently.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Living close to the coast and air pollution were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer and skin melanoma, respectively. These findings from the UKBB support the role of the local environment on cancer development, which is independent from genetics and may be mediated by several lifestyle factors."

The multicentre, retrospective ARCHERY study (UMIN000034131) collected tissue samples from Japanese patients with recurrent or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who received systemic therapy between 2010 and 2015. In this exploratory analysis, the prognostic impact of immune phenotype and PD-L1 expression (separately and combined) was investigated using 770 surgical specimens and outcomes from patients enrolled in ARCHERY. A key objective was to determine overall survival (OS), defined as time from nephrectomy to death from any cause, by immune and PD-L1 subgroups. The median OS by immune phenotype was 28.8, 57.3, and 63.4 months in patients with inflamed, excluded, and desert tumours, respectively [hazard ratio (95% CI): inflamed 1.78 (1.27-2.49); excluded 1.08 (0.89-1.30); desert as reference]. PD-L1 positivity by SP142 showed a strong association with immune phenotype; 88.1%, 61.9%, and 8.7% of PD-L1-positive patients had inflamed, excluded, and desert phenotypes, respectively. PD-L1 positivity was also associated with worse OS in each phenotype, except for the inflamed phenotype (due to limited sample size in the PD-L1-negative immune inflamed subgroup; n=7). Additionally, the difference in OS by PD-L1 status was larger in the desert versus excluded phenotype [median OS in PD-L1 positive vs negative: 27.1 vs 67.2 months (desert), and 48.2 vs 78.1 months (excluded)]. Results show that PD-L1 expression was highly associated with immune phenotype, but both covariates should be evaluated when determining prognosis."

UFP exposures were estimated using a land use regression model. Exposures were assigned to residential locations at the time of diagnosis/recruitment as well as approximately 10-years earlier to consider potential latency between exposure and disease onset. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated per interquartile range (IQR) increase in UFPs (approximately 4000 particles/cm3) using logistic regression models adjusting for individual-level and ecological covariates.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Ambient UFP concentrations were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) in fully adjusted models when exposures were assigned to residences 10-years prior to diagnosis.

            "abstract": "Per-fluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of synthetic fluorinated chemicals used widely in industry and consumer products. Due to their extensive use and chemical stability, PFAS are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and as such, form an emerging risk factor for male reproductive health. The long half-lives of PFAS is of particular concern as the propensity to accumulate in biological systems prolong the time taken for excretion, taking years in many cases. Accordingly, there is mounting evidence supporting a negative association between PFAS exposure and an array of human health conditions. However, inconsistencies among epidemiological and experimental findings have hindered the ability to definitively link negative reproductive outcomes to specific PFAS exposure. This situation highlights the requirement for further investigation and the identification of reliable biological models that can inform health risks, allowing sensitive assessment of the spectrum of effects of PFAS exposure on humans. Here, we review the literature on the biological effects of PFAS exposure, with a specific focus on male reproduction, owing to its utility as a sentinel marker of general health. Indeed, male infertility has increasingly been shown to serve as an early indicator of a range of co-morbidities such as coronary, inflammatory, and metabolic diseases. It follows that adverse associations have been established between PFAS exposure and the incidence of testicular dysfunction, including pathologies such as testicular cancer and a reduction in semen quality. We also give consideration to the mechanisms that render the male reproductive tract vulnerable to PFAS mediated damage, and discuss novel remediation strategies to mitigate the negative impact of PFAS contamination and/or to ameliorate the PFAS load of exposed individuals."

The validated MyProstateScore test is clinically-available for pre-biopsy risk stratification. In biopsy-naïve patients, we recently validated a straightforward testing approach to rule-out GG ≥ 2 cancer with 98% negative predictive value (NPV) and 97% sensitivity. In the current study, we established a practical MPS-based testing approach in men with a previous negative biopsy being considered for repeat biopsy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients provided post-digital rectal examination urine prior to repeat biopsy. MyProstateScore was calculated using the validated, locked model including urinary PCA3 and TMPRSS2:ERG scores with serum PSA. In a clinically-appropriate primary (i.e., training) cohort, we identified a lower (rule-out) threshold approximating 90% sensitivity and an upper (rule-in) threshold approximating 80% specificity for GG ≥ 2 cancer. These thresholds were applied to an external validation cohort, and performance measures and clinical outcomes associated with their use were calculated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      MyProstateScore thresholds of 15 and 40 met pre-defined performance criteria in the primary cohort (422 patients; median PSA 6.4, IQR 4.3-9.1).

The well-ranked 16 driver candidates harboring genomic alterations and regulated by a set of miRNAs, including hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-34a and hsa-miR-130b, were significantly associated with over-represented pathways in cancer, such as immune-inflammatory system, apoptosis and cell cycle.

Patients with MUO were divided into three risk groups based on the score calculated using four prognostic factors (PLaCT: Primary site, Laterality, serum Creatinine level, and Treatment for primary site) at the first visit, and prospective follow-up was performed. Overall survival and ureteral stent failure-free survival of each risk group were compared. In total, 300 patients with 21 different primary sites were enrolled. The numbers of patients in good, intermediate, and poor risk groups were 105, 106, and 89, respectively. Median survival times of patients in good, intermediate, and poor risk groups were 406, 221, and 77 days, respectively (P < 0.0001). In 217 patients with ureteral stenting, median ureteral stent failure-free survival times of good, intermediate, and poor risk groups were 385, 183, and 57 days, respectively (P < 0.0001). Limitations include the limited ethnicity and the extended duration of study enrollment. The novel PLaCT risk classification score could divide MUO patients into three risk groups with distinct survival times and ureteral stent patencies. This score will aid in establishing prognosis and treatment strategy for all physicians engaged in cancer treatment."

This study aims to develop and validate a deep-learning (DL) algorithm to automatically segment renal tumours, kidneys, and perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT) from computed tomography (CT) images and extract radiomics features to predict the pathological grade of ccRCC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In this cross-ethnic retrospective study, a total of 614 patients were divided into a training set (383 patients from the local hospital), an internal validation set (88 patients from the local hospital), and an external validation set (143 patients from the public dataset). A two-dimensional TransUNet-based DL model combined with the train-while-annotation method was trained for automatic volumetric segmentation of renal tumours, kidneys, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) on images from two groups of datasets. PRAT was extracted using a dilation algorithm by calculating voxels of VAT surrounding the kidneys. Radiomics features were subsequently extracted from three regions of interest of CT images, adopting multiple filtering strategies. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used for feature selection, and the support vector machine (SVM) for developing the pathological grading model. Ensemble learning was used for imbalanced data classification. Performance evaluation included the Dice coefficient for segmentation and metrics such as accuracy and area under curve (AUC) for classification. The WHO/International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grading models were finally interpreted and visualized using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      For automatic segmentation, the mean Dice coefficient achieved 0.836 for renal tumours and 0.967 for VAT on the internal validation dataset.

            "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is the number one risk factor for bladder cancer development and epidemiological data suggest that nearly half of all bladder cancer patients have a history of smoking. In addition to stimulating the growth of a primary tumor, it has been shown that there is a correlation between smoking and tumor metastasis. Platelet activating factor (PAF) is expressed on the cell surface of the activated endothelium and, through binding with the PAF-receptor (PAF-R), facilitates transendothelial migration of cells in the circulation (McHowat et al. Biochemistry 40:14921-14931; 2001). In this study, we show that the exposure of bladder cancer cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) results in increased PAF accumulation and increased expression of the PAF-R. Furthermore, treatment with CSE increases adherence of bladder cancer cells to bladder endothelial cells and could be abrogated by pretreatment with ginkgolide B. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor biopsy samples from bladder cancer patients who smoked revealed increased PAF and the PAF-R in tumor regions when compared to normal tissue. These data highlight a pathway in bladder cancer that is influenced by CSE which could facilitate primary tumor growth and increase metastatic potential. Targeting of the PAF-PAFR interaction could serve as a beneficial therapeutic target for managing further growth of a developing tumor."

Further aims are to investigate the trajectories of these issues over time, the co-existence between sexual dysfunction and fertility-related distress, and the relation between these issues and body image, anxiety and depression, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy related to sexuality and fertility, and fertility-related knowledge.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Participants in the Fex-Can Cohort will be identified via the Swedish National Quality Registries for Brain Tumors, Breast Cancer, Gynecological Oncology, Lymphoma, and Testicular Cancer. All patients diagnosed at the ages of 18-39, during a period of 18 months, will be invited to participate. Established instruments will be used to measure sexual function (PROMIS SexFS), fertility-related distress (RCAC), body image (BIS), anxiety and depression (HADS), and health-related quality of life (QLQ-C30); Self-efficacy and fertility-related knowledge will be assessed by study-specific measures. The survey will be administered to participants at baseline (approximately 1.5 year after diagnosis) and at 3 and 5 years post-diagnosis. Registry data will be used to collect clinical variables. A comparison group of 2000 young adults will be drawn from the Swedish population register (SPAR) and subsequently approached with the same measures as the cancer group.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      The study will determine the prevalence and predictors of sexual dysfunction and fertility-related distress in young men and women with cancer. The findings will form a basis for developing interventions to alleviate sexual problems and fertility-related distress in young adults with cancer in the short and long term.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      This is an observational cohort study and clinical trial registration was therefore not obtained."

Cox regression was used to evaluate the COXEN score or treatment arm association with EFS and OS.\n    \n\n\n          Results and limitations:\n        \n      \n      A total of 167 evaluable patients were included in the COXEN analysis. The COXEN scores were not significantly prognostic for OS or EFS in the respective arms, but the GC COXEN score had a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.99; p = 0.047) when the arms were pooled. In the intent-to-treat analysis (n = 227), there was no significant difference between ddMVAC and GC for OS (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.54-1.40; p = 0.57) or EFS (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59-1.26; p = 0.45). Among the 192 patients who underwent surgery, pathologic response (pT0 vs downstaging vs no response) was strongly correlated with superior postsurgical survival (5-yr OS 90%, 89% and 52%, respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The COXEN GC score has prognostic value for patients receiving cisplatin-based neoadjuvant treatment. The randomized, prospective design provides estimates of OS and EFS for GC and ddMVAC in this population. Pathologic response (<pT2) performed well as an intermediate endpoint in this modern cohort. For expediency in evaluating new regimens, pathologic response should continue to be used in phase 2 trials.\n    \n\n\n          Patient summary:\n        \n      \n      In this study, we evaluated a biomarker to predict the response to chemotherapy. The results did not meet the preset study parameters, but our study provides information on clinical outcomes with the use of chemotherapy before surgery for bladder cancer."

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men. Green tea consumption is reported to play an important role in the prevention of carcinogenesis in many types of malignancies, including prostate cancer; however, epidemiological studies show conflicting results regarding these anti-cancer effects. In recent years, in addition to prevention, many investigators have shown the efficacy and safety of green tea polyphenols and combination therapies with green tea extracts and anti-cancer agents in in vivo and in vitro studies. Furthermore, numerous studies have revealed the molecular mechanisms of the anti-cancer effects of green tea extracts. We believe that improved understanding of the detailed pathological roles at the molecular level is important to evaluate the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer. Therefore, in this review, we present current knowledge regarding the anti-cancer effects of green tea extracts in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms of action, such as influencing tumor growth, apoptosis, androgen receptor signaling, cell cycle, and various malignant behaviors. Finally, the future direction for the use of green tea extracts as treatment strategies in patients with prostate cancer is introduced."

In this study, we aimed to assess efficacy and safety after extended follow-up to inform the long-term clinical benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus sunitinib in this setting.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      In the phase 3, randomised, controlled CheckMate 214 trial, patients aged 18 years and older with previously untreated, advanced, or metastatic histologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component were recruited from 175 hospitals and cancer centres in 28 countries. Patients were categorised by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk status into favourable-risk, intermediate-risk, and poor-risk subgroups and randomly assigned (1:1) to open-label nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) plus ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously) every 3 weeks for four doses, followed by nivolumab (3 mg/kg intravenously) every 2 weeks; or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily for 4 weeks (6-week cycle). Randomisation was done through an interactive voice response system, with a block size of four and stratified by risk status and geographical region. The co-primary endpoints for the trial were overall survival, progression-free survival per independent radiology review committee (IRRC), and objective responses per IRRC in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival per IRRC, and objective responses per IRRC in the intention-to-treat population, and adverse events in all treated patients. In this Article, we report overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, investigator-assessed objective response, characterisation of response, and safety after extended follow-up. Efficacy outcomes were assessed in all randomly assigned patients; safety was assessed in all treated patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02231749, and is ongoing but now closed to recruitment.\n    \n\n\n          Findings:\n        \n      \n      Between Oct 16, 2014, and Feb 23, 2016, of 1390 patients screened, 1096 (79%) eligible patients were randomly assigned to nivolumab plus ipilimumab or sunitinib (550 vs 546 in the intention-to-treat population; 425 vs 422 intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, and 125 vs 124 favourable-risk patients). With extended follow-up (median follow-up 32·4 months [IQR 13·4-36·3]), in intermediate-risk or poor-risk patients, results for the three co-primary efficacy endpoints showed that nivolumab plus ipilimumab continued to be superior to sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI 35·6-not estimable] vs 26·6 months [22·1-33·4]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·54-0·80], p<0·0001), progression-free survival (median 8·2 months [95% CI 6·9-10·0] vs 8·3 months [7·0-8·8]; HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·65-0·90], p=0·0014), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (178 [42%] of 425 vs 124 [29%] of 422; p=0·0001). Similarly, in intention-to-treat patients, nivolumab and ipilimumab showed improved efficacy compared with sunitinib in terms of overall survival (median not reached [95% CI not estimable] vs 37·9 months [32·2-not estimable]; HR 0·71 [95% CI 0·59-0·86], p=0·0003), progression-free survival (median 9·7 months [95% CI 8·1-11·1] vs 9·7 months [8·3-11·1]; HR 0·85 [95% CI 0·73-0·98], p=0·027), and the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (227 [41%] of 550 vs 186 [34%] of 546 p=0·015). In all treated patients, the most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events in the nivolumab and ipilimumab group were increased lipase (57 [10%] of 547), increased amylase (31 [6%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (28 [5%]), whereas in the sunitinib group they were hypertension (90 [17%] of 535), fatigue (51 [10%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia (49 [9%]).

            "abstract": "Purpose: A 1.5 T MR Linac (MRL) has recently become available. MRL treatment workflows (WF) include online plan adaptation based on daily MR images (MRI). This study reports initial clinical experiences after five months of use in terms of patient compliance, cases, WF timings, and dosimetric accuracy. Method and materials: Two different WF were used dependent on the clinical situation of the day; Adapt To Position WF (ATP) where the reference plan position is adjusted rigidly to match the position of the targets and the OARs, and Adapt To Shape WF (ATS), where a new plan is created to match the anatomy of the day, using deformable image registration. Both WFs included three 3D MRI scans for plan adaptation, verification before beam on, and validation during IMRT delivery. Patient compliance and WF timings were recorded. Accuracy in dose delivery was assessed using a cylindrical diode phantom. Results: Nineteen patients have completed their treatment receiving a total of 176 fractions. Cases vary from prostate treatments (60Gy/20F) to SBRT treatments of lymph nodes (45 Gy/3F) and castration by ovarian irradiation (15 Gy/3F). The median session time (patient in to patient out) for 127 ATPs was 26 (21-78) min, four fractions lasted more than 45 min due to additional plan adaptation. For the 49 ATSs a median time of 12 (1-24) min was used for contouring resulting in a total median session time of 42 (29-91) min. Three SBRT fractions lasted more than an hour. The time on the MRL couch was well tolerated by the patients. The median gamma pass rate (2 mm,2% global max) for the adapted plans was 99.2 (93.4-100)%, showing good agreement between planned and delivered dose. Conclusion: MRL treatments, including daily MRIs, plan adaptation, and accurate dose delivery, are possible within a clinically acceptable timeframe and well tolerated by the patients."

            "abstract": "Extracellular vesicle (EV) molecular phenotyping offers enormous opportunities for cancer diagnostics. However, the majority of the associated studies adopted biomarker-based unimodal analysis to achieve cancer diagnosis, which has high false positives and low precision. Herein, we report a multimodal platform for the high-precision diagnosis of bladder cancer (BCa) through a multispectral 3D DNA machine in combination with a multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithm. The DNA machine was constructed using magnetic microparticles (MNPs) functionalized with aptamers that specifically identify the target of interest, i.e., five protein markers on bladder-cancer-derived urinary EVs (uEVs). The aptamers were hybridized with DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs) and a G-quadruplex/hemin complex to form a sensing module. Such a DNA machine ensured multispectral detection of protein markers by fluorescence (FL), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and UV-vis absorption (Abs). The obtained data sets then underwent uni- or multimodal ML for BCa diagnosis to compare the analytical performance. In this study, urine samples were obtained from our prospective cohort (n = 45). Our analytical results showed that the 3D DNA machine provided a detection limit of 9.2 × 103 particles mL-1 with a linear range of 4 × 104 to 5 × 107 particles mL-1 for uEVs. Moreover, the multimodal data fusion model exhibited an accuracy of 95.0%, a precision of 93.1%, and a recall rate of 93.2% on average, while those of the three types of unimodal models were no more than 91%. The elevated diagnosis precision by using the present fusion platform offers a perspective approach to diminishing the rate of misdiagnosis and overtreatment of BCa."

            "abstract": "Importance:\n        \n      \n      There is controversy about the benefit of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Prostate-specific antigen screening rates have decreased since 2008 in the US, and the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has increased. However, there is no direct epidemiologic evidence of a correlation between population PSA screening rates and subsequent metastatic prostate cancer rates.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      To assess whether facility-level variation in PSA screening rates is associated with subsequent facility-level metastatic prostate cancer incidence.\n    \n\n\n          Design, setting, and participants:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective cohort used data for all men aged 40 years or older with an encounter at 128 facilities in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2019.\n    \n\n\n          Exposures:\n        \n      \n      Yearly facility-level PSA screening rates, defined as the proportion of men aged 40 years or older with a PSA test in each year, and long-term nonscreening rates, defined as the proportion of men aged 40 years or older without a PSA test in the prior 3 years, from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2014.\n    \n\n\n          Main outcomes and measures:\n        \n      \n      The main outcomes were facility-level yearly counts of incident metastatic prostate cancer diagnoses and age-adjusted yearly metastatic prostate cancer incidence rates (per 100 000 men) 5 years after each PSA screening exposure year.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The cohort included 4 678 412 men in 2005 and 5 371 701 men in 2019.

Higher facility-level PSA screening rates were associated with lower metastatic prostate cancer incidence 5 years later (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.91 per 10% increase in PSA screening rate; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96; P < .001). Higher long-term nonscreening rates were associated with higher metastatic prostate cancer incidence 5 years later (IRR, 1.11 per 10% increase in long-term nonscreening rate; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19; P = .01).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions and relevance:\n        \n      \n      From 2005 to 2019, PSA screening rates decreased in the national VHA system.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to determine the association. PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane database were searched from 1 January 1975 to 7 January 2020. Study selection, data extraction and bias assessment (using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale) were performed independently by 2 authors. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. In all, 16 studies (11 cohort studies and 5 case-control studies) involving a total of 391,071 HCV patients and 38,333,839 non-HCV controls were included. The overall analysis showed a 47% higher risk to develop kidney cancer among the patients with HCV infection (pooled OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), despite significant heterogeneity (I2 = 87.6%). The multivariable meta-regression showed that study design, age, sample size and HIV co-infection were significant sources of variance, and totally accounted for 82% of the I2 . The risk of KC in HCV patients was further increased in studies without HCV/HBV- and HCV/HIV- co-infection (pooled OR 1.66; 95%CI 1.23-2.24). Multiple sensitivity analyses did not change the significant association. The present meta-analysis indicated that HCV-infected patients have a significantly higher risk of developing kidney cancer. Our results highlighted the rationale for improved renal surveillance in HCV patients for the early diagnosis of kidney cancer. Further investigations for the mechanisms underlying HCV-induced kidney cancer are warranted."

Mannitol is widely used to treat increased ICP. However, no studies to date have specifically evaluated the effect of mannitol on ICP in patients undergoing RALP. Ultrasonographic measurement of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is considered a reliable technique to noninvasively evaluate the ICP. Therefore, this study compared ONSDs as a surrogate for ICP before and after mannitol administration in prostate cancer patients undergoing RALP.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Mannitol (0.5 g/kg) was administered after pneumoperitoneum establishment and shifting to the Trendelenburg position. ONSDs were measured at six predetermined time points: 10 minutes after anesthesia induction (T0); 5 minutes after pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position before mannitol administration (T1); 30 minutes (T2), 60 minutes (T3), and 90 minutes (T4) after completion of mannitol administration during pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position; and at skin closure in the supine position (T5). Moreover, intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory variables were evaluated simultaneously.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Thirty-six patients were analyzed. ONSDs were significantly lower at T2, T3, and T4 than at T1 (all p < 0.001), with the greatest decrease observed at T4 compared with T1 (4.46 ± 0.2 mm vs 4.81 ± 0.3 mm, p < 0.001). Regional cerebral oxygen saturation, cardiac output, corrected flow time, peak velocity, body temperature, arterial CO2 partial pressure, peak airway pressure, plateau airway pressure, dynamic compliance, and static compliance were not significantly different during pneumoperitoneum and the Trendelenburg position; however, mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were significantly different.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Mannitol decreases the ONSD in patients undergoing RALP with CO2 pneumoperitoneum and the steep Trendelenburg position.

Here, we investigated the biomarker potential in localized and de novo metastatic PCa (mPCa) of methylated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma. Using the Marmal-aid database and in-house datasets, we identified three top candidates specifically hypermethylated in PCa tissue: DOCK2,HAPLN3, and FBXO30 (specificity/sensitivity: 80%-100%/75-94%). These candidates were further analyzed in plasma samples from 36 healthy controls, 61 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), 102 localized PCa, and 65 de novo mPCa patients using methylation-specific droplet digital PCR. Methylated ctDNA for DOCK2/HAPLN3/FBXO30 was generally not detected in healthy controls, BPH patients, nor in patients with localized PCa despite a positive signal in 98%-100% of matched radical prostatectomy tissue samples. However, ctDNA methylation of DOCK2,HAPLN3, and/or FBXO30 was detected in 61.5% (40/65) of de novo mPCa patients and markedly increased in high- compared to low-volume mPCa (89.3% (25/28) vs. 32.1% (10/31), p < 0.001). Moreover, detection of methylated ctDNA was associated with significantly shorter time to progression to metastatic castration resistant PCa, independent of tumor-volume. These results indicate that methylated ctDNA (DOCK2/HAPLN3/FBXO30) may be potentially useful for identification of hormone-naïve mPCa patients who could benefit from intensified treatment."

            "abstract": "Intra-tumor heterogeneity contributes to treatment failure and poor survival in urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC). Analyzing transcriptome from a UBC cohort, we report that intra-tumor transcriptomic heterogeneity indicates co-existence of tumor cells in epithelial and mesenchymal-like transcriptional states and bi-directional transition between them occurs within and between tumor subclones. We model spontaneous and reversible transition between these partially heritable states in cell lines and characterize their population dynamics. SMAD3, KLF4 and PPARG emerge as key regulatory markers of the transcriptional dynamics. Nutrient limitation, as in the core of large tumors, and radiation treatment perturb the dynamics, initially selecting for a transiently resistant phenotype and then reconstituting heterogeneity and growth potential, driving adaptive evolution. Dominance of transcriptional states with low PPARG expression indicates an aggressive phenotype in UBC patients. We propose that phenotypic plasticity and dynamic, non-genetic intra-tumor heterogeneity modulate both the trajectory of disease progression and adaptive treatment response in UBC."

Demographic and clinical data, as well as tumor-related parameters, were extracted. We identified 413 consecutive hospitalized patients with PC, and 21 (5%) of them also had a primary CRC. At the time of diagnosis, the mean age of the patients with PC was 71.2 ± 6 years, and 71.8 ± 10 years for patients with CRC. Synchronous PC and CRC tumors were identified in 3/21 cases and metachronous tumors in 18/21 cases. Prostate cancer was the first tumor to be diagnosed in 13/18 cases and CRC in 5/18 cases. The most frequent subtype of PC was acinar adenocarcinoma (90%) and for CRC cases, conventional adenocarcinoma (90%). Prostate and colorectal cancers tend to co-occur in a single patient. The diagnosis of one of these two types of tumors should imply the screening for the other one, because these patients require a multidisciplinary and personalized approach."

This study aimed to identify reliable biomarkers associated with muscle invasion and prognosis to identify potential therapeutic targets for MIBC. Four gene datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and the integrated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then subjected to gene ontology (GO) terms and pathway enrichment analyses. Correlation analysis between the expression of the top-ranking DEGs and pathological T stages was performed to identify the genes associated with early muscle invasion. The corresponding prognostic values were evaluated, and co-expressed genes mined in the cBioPortal database were loaded into ClueGo in Cytoscape for pathway enrichment analysis. Using data mining from the STRING and TCGA databases, protein-protein interaction and competitive endogenous RNA networks were constructed. In total, 645 integrated DEGs were identified and these were mainly enriched in 26 pathways, including cell cycle, bladder cancer, DNA replication, and PPAR signaling pathway. S100A7 expression was significantly increased from the T2 stage and showed significantly worse overall survival and disease-specific survival in patients with BC. In total, 144 genes co-expressed with S100A7 in BC were significantly enriched in the IL-17 pathway. S100A7 was predicted to directly interact with LYZ, which potentially shows competitive binding with hsa-mir-140 to affect the expression of six lncRNAs in MIBC. In conclusion, high S100A7 expression was predicted to be associated with early muscle invasion and poor survival in patients with BC."

The patients were divided into either the usual care or exercise group. All patients received measurements a week before ADT initiation, six- and twelve months after treatment. The exercise group received both aerobic and resistance training. The analysis was conducted using appropriate statistical methods. There were 45 males enrolled (age 67.4 ± 8 years and BMI 25.5 ± 3.6 kg/m2). Profound changes were observed at six months follow-up. The exercise group showed a significant increase in the trunk and leg lean mass, and a lesser loss of total and arm lean mass. A significant decrease in PSA was also observed among the exercise group. PNI and PSA were significantly associated with regional lean mass. Exercise can prevent loss or even increase lean mass in high-risk PCa, especially in the early stage of ADT treatment. Moreover, a strong bond between lean mass and PNI and PSA further underscores the importance of early and continuous exercise interventions."

Using longer follow-up and individual patient-data from KEYNOTE-045, this study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy or atezolizumab from a US payer perspective.Materials and methods: A partitioned-survival model was developed over a 20-year time horizon. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were extrapolated using a piecewise modelling approach, where patient-level data from KEYNOTE-045 were used for the initial period followed by parametric distributions. OS of atezolizumab was estimated by indirect treatment comparisons based on KEYNOTE-045 and IMvigor211. Different scenarios were explored in the absence of indirect comparisons on PFS and time-on-treatment (ToT) between pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse events, and terminal care costs were considered.Results: Compared with chemotherapy, pembrolizumab resulted in a mean gain of 1.33 life-years and 1.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and an incremental cost of $106,299, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $93,481/QALY gained. Pembrolizumab dominated atezolizumab in extending patients' life by 0.89 years and 0.76 QALYs, while reducing costs by $26,458. Key drivers of cost-effectiveness included survival extrapolation, OS hazard ratio of pembrolizumab vs. atezolizumab, and time horizon. Pembrolizumab had a 66% and 100% probability of being cost-effective vs. chemotherapy and atezolizumab, respectively, at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold.Limitations and conclusions: Uncertainties remain with extrapolated PFS and OS for pembrolizumab, OS indirect comparison, and ToT for atezolizumab. Despite these limitations, the model used robust methods to estimate key clinical endpoints with patient-level data from longer follow-up of KEYNOTE-045. Pembrolizumab dominates atezolizumab and is very likely cost-effective vs. chemotherapy in 2 L mUC at a $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold."

However, the evidence that exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) either in childhood or adult life is also associated with UBC risk is ambiguous. With this meta-analysis, we aim to summarise how exposure to ETS is associated with UBC risk. Methods: In total, 11 studies (3 cohort studies, 8 case-control studies) were included in this meta-analysis and summary odds ratios (SORs) for UBC risk were calculated for never smokers who were exposed to ETS during childhood at home, during adulthood at home, or during adulthood in a work environment compared to never smokers who were never exposed to ETS. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. Results: Never smokers exposed to ETS during childhood (SOR = 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-1.26), during adulthood at work (SOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.78-1.18) or at home (SOR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.83-1.15) were at a similar risk of UBC compared to never smokers who were never exposed to ETS.

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disruptor that it is present in numerous products of daily use. The aim of this study was to assess the potential association of serum BPA concentrations and the risk of incident breast and prostate cancer in a sub-cohort of the Spanish European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We designed a case-cohort study within the EPIC-Spain cohort. Study population consisted on 4812 participants from 4 EPIC-Spain centers (547 breast cancer cases, 575 prostate cancer cases and 3690 sub-cohort participants). BPA exposure was assessed by means of chemical analyses of serum samples collected at recruitment. Borgan II weighted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Median follow-up time in our study was 16.9 years. BPA geometric mean serum values of cases and sub-cohort were 1.12 ng/ml vs 1.10 ng/ml respectively for breast cancer and 1.33 ng/ml vs 1.29 ng/ml respectively for prostate cancer. When categorizing BPA into tertiles, a 40% increase in risk of prostate cancer for tertile 1 (p = 0.022), 37% increase for tertile 2 (p = 0.034) and 31% increase for tertile 3 (p = 0.072) was observed with respect to values bellow the limit of detection. No significant association was observed between BPA levels and breast cancer risk.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We found a similar percentage of detection of BPA among cases and sub-cohort from our population, and no association with breast cancer risk was observed. However, we found a higher risk of prostate cancer for the increase in serum BPA levels. Further investigation is needed to understand the influence of BPA in prostate cancer risk."

            "abstract": "Aims:\n        \n      \n      To determine the relationship between local relapse following radical radiotherapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and radiation dose.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients with T2-4N0-3M0 MIBC were recruited to a phase II study assessing the feasibility of intensity-modulated radiotherapy to the bladder and pelvic lymph nodes. Patients were planned to receive 64 Gy/32 fractions to the bladder tumour, 60 Gy/32 fractions to the involved pelvic nodes and 52 Gy/32 fractions to the uninvolved bladder and pelvic nodes. Pre-treatment set-up was informed by cone-beam CT. For patients who experienced local relapse, cystoscopy and imaging (CT/MRI) was used to reconstruct the relapse gross tumour volume (GTVrelapse) on the original planning CT . GTVrelapse D98% and D95% was determined by co-registering the relapse image to the planning CT utilising deformable image registration (DIR) and rigid image registration (RIR). Failure was classified into five types based on spatial and dosimetric criteria as follows: A (central high-dose failure), B (peripheral high-dose failure), C (central elective dose failure), D (peripheral elective dose failure) and E (extraneous dose failure).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Between June 2009 and November 2012, 38 patients were recruited. Following treatment, 18/38 (47%) patients experienced local relapse within the bladder. The median time to local relapse was 9.0 months (95% confidence interval 6.3-11.7). Seventeen of 18 patients were evaluable based on the availability of cross-sectional relapse imaging. A significant difference between DIR and RIR methods was seen. With the DIR approach, the median GTVrelapse D98% and D95% was 97% and 98% of prescribed dose, respectively. Eleven of 17 (65%) patients experienced type A failure and 6/17 (35%) patients type B failure. No patients had type C, D or E failure. MIBC failure occurred in 10/17 (59%) relapsed patients; of those, 7/11 (64%) had type A failure and 3/6 (50%) had type B failure. Non-MIBC failure occurred in 7/17 (41%) patients; 4/11 (36%) with type A failure and 3/6 (50%) with type B failure.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Relapse following radiotherapy occurred within close proximity to the original bladder tumour volume and within the planned high-dose region, suggesting possible biological causes for failure. We advise caution when considering margin reduction for future reduced high-dose radiation volume or partial bladder radiotherapy protocols."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Various factors, including patient demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, patient out-of-pocket (OOP) costs, therapy-related factors, clinical characteristics, and health-system factors, can affect patient adherence to oral anticancer medications (OAMs). OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients initiating oral anticancer therapy who were adherent to OAMs and to identify significant predictors of adherence to OAMs, including patient OOP costs and patient demographics. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from Optum Clinformatics Data Mart commercial claims database for 2010-2018. Patients with a new pharmacy claim for an OAM between July 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, were followed for 6 months to ascertain their medication adherence, which was defined as a proportion of days covered value of at least 0.8. Average monthly patient OOP costs for OAM prescriptions were categorized as lower OOP costs (quartiles 1-3) and higher OOP costs (quartile 4). Separate multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify predictors of OAM nonadherence for each cancer type. RESULTS: Out of 37,938 patients with cancer, 51.9% were adherent to OAMs, with adherence ranging from 32.8% among those with liver cancer to 70.4% among those with brain tumor. The average monthly OOP costs of OAMs also differed by cancer type, ranging from $749 (SD = $1,014) among patients with blood cancer to $106 (SD = $439) among those with prostate cancer. Higher patient OOP costs were associated with higher odds of OAM nonadherence for many cancer types, including renal cancer (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.91; 95% CI = 2.80-5.47) and breast cancer (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.13-1.41). Additionally, patients with inpatient hospitalizations during the 6 months following OAM initiation had significantly higher odds of OAM nonadherence for all cancer types except for stomach cancer. Among patients with stomach cancer, male sex was associated with lower odds of OAM nonadherence (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.37-0.97). Among patients with renal or stomach cancer, those who had Medicare low-income subsidy had higher odds of OAM nonadherence compared with those with commercial insurance coverage. Among patients with blood cancers, Black and Hispanic patients had higher odds of OAM nonadherence compared with White patients (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.25-1.75 and AOR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.13-1.68, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall adherence to OAMs was suboptimal, and for several cancer types, adherence was worse among patients with higher OOP costs, those who were hospitalized, and those who received Medicare low-income subsidy. Policies addressing cost and access to OAMs and health-system strategies to address barriers to the effective use of OAMs are needed to improve patient access to these vital medications.

Immunohistochemical staining for NSD2 was carried out on specimen obtained from palliative resection of the prostate. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between NSD2 expression and PCa progression.Results: Of the 53 patients, 41 had castration-resistant PCa and 48 men had metastases at time of tissue acquisition. NSD2 expression was increased in tumour specimen from 42 patients (79.2%). In univariable Cox regression analyses, NSD2 expression was associated with PSA progression, progression on imaging and overall survival (p = 0.04, respectively). In multivariable analyses, NSD2 expression did not retain its association with these endpoints.Conclusions: NSD2 expression is abnormal in almost 80% of patients with advanced PCa. Expression levels of this epigenetic regulator are easily detected by immunohistochemistry while this biomarker exhibited prognostic value for PCa progression and death in univariable analysis. Further studies on NSD2 involvement in PCa proliferation, progression, metastasis and resistance mechanisms are needed."

Setting The ERSPC has shown a 21% reduction in prostate cancer mortality in men invited to screening with follow-up truncated at 13 years. Centres either used pre-consent randomisation (effectiveness design) or post-consent randomisation (efficacy design). Methods In six centres (three effectiveness design, three efficacy design) with follow-up until the end of 2010, or maximum 13 years, the effect of screening was estimated as both effectiveness (mortality reduction in the target population) and efficacy (reduction in those actually screened). Results The overall crude prostate cancer mortality risk ratio in the intervention arm vs control arm for the six centres was 0.79 ranging from a 14% increase to a 38% reduction. The risk ratio was 0.85 in centres with effectiveness design and 0.73 in those with efficacy design. After correcting for design, overall efficacy was 27%, 24% in pre-consent and 29% in post-consent centres, ranging between a 12% increase and a 52% reduction. Conclusion The estimated overall effect of screening in attenders (efficacy) was a 27% reduction in prostate cancer mortality at 13 years' follow-up. The variation in efficacy between centres was greater than the range in risk ratio without correction for design. The centre-specific variation in the mortality reduction could not be accounted for by the randomisation method."

Therefore, it is important to investigate whether programmes to enhance the return-to-work (RTW) process for people who have been diagnosed with cancer are effective. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011 and updated in 2015.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the effectiveness of non-medical interventions aimed at enhancing return to work (RTW) in people with cancer compared to alternative programmes including usual care or no intervention.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and three trial registers up to 18 August 2021. We also examined the reference lists of included studies and selected reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs on the effectiveness of psycho-educational, vocational, physical or multidisciplinary interventions enhancing RTW in people with cancer. The primary outcome was RTW measured as either RTW rate or sick leave duration measured at 12 months' follow-up. The secondary outcome was quality of life (QoL).\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors independently assessed RCTs for inclusion, extracted data and rated certainty of the evidence using GRADE. We pooled study results judged to be clinically homogeneous in different comparisons reporting risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for RTW and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% CIs for QoL.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 15 RCTs involving 1477 people with cancer with 19 evaluations because of multiple treatment groups. In this update, we added eight new RCTs and excluded seven RCTs from the previous versions of this review that were aimed at medical interventions. All included RCTs were conducted in high-income countries, and most were aimed at people with breast cancer (nine RCTs) or prostate cancer (two RCTs). Risk of bias We judged nine RCTs at low risk of bias and six at high risk of bias. The most common type of bias was a lack of blinding (9/15 RCTs). Psycho-educational interventions We found four RCTs comparing psycho-educational interventions including patient education and patient counselling versus care as usual. Psycho-educational interventions probably result in little to no difference in RTW compared to care as usual (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.24; 4 RCTs, 512 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that in the intervention and control groups, approximately 625 per 1000 participants may have returned to work. The psycho-educational interventions may result in little to no difference in QoL compared to care as usual (MD 1.47, 95% CI -2.38 to 5.32; 1 RCT, 124 participants; low-certainty evidence). Vocational interventions We found one RCT comparing vocational intervention versus care as usual. The evidence was very uncertain about the effect of a vocational intervention on RTW compared to care as usual (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13; 1 RCT, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not report QoL. Physical interventions Four RCTs compared a physical intervention programme versus care as usual. These physical intervention programmes included walking, yoga or physical exercise. Physical interventions likely increase RTW compared to care as usual (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.39; 4 RCTs, 434 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that in the intervention group probably 677 to 871 per 1000 participants RTW compared to 627 per 1000 in the control group (thus, 50 to 244 participants more RTW). Physical interventions may result in little to no difference in QoL compared to care as usual (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.32; 1 RCT, 173 participants; low-certainty evidence). The SMD translates back to a 1.8-point difference (95% CI -7.54 to 3.97) on the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Multidisciplinary interventions Six RCTs compared multidisciplinary interventions (vocational counselling, patient education, patient counselling, physical exercises) to care as usual. Multidisciplinary interventions likely increase RTW compared to care as usual (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.33; 6 RCTs, 497 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that in the intervention group probably 694 to 844 per 1000 participants RTW compared to 625 per 1000 in the control group (thus, 69 to 217 participants more RTW). Multidisciplinary interventions may result in little to no difference in QoL compared to care as usual (SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.28; 3 RCTs, 378 participants; low-certainty evidence). The SMD translates back to a 1.4-point difference (95% CI -2.58 to 5.36) on the EORTC QLQ-C30.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Physical interventions (four RCTs) and multidisciplinary interventions (six RCTs) likely increase RTW of people with cancer. Psycho-educational interventions (four RCTs) probably result in little to no difference in RTW, while the evidence from vocational interventions (one RCT) is very uncertain. Psycho-educational, physical or multidisciplinary interventions may result in little to no difference in QoL. Future research on enhancing RTW in people with cancer involving multidisciplinary interventions encompassing a physical, psycho-educational and vocational component is needed, and be preferably tailored to the needs of the patient."

Primary nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) originate from vehicle emissions. The association between air pollution and urinary bladder cancer (UBC) is debatable. We investigated whether long-term exposure to ambient hydrocarbons increases UBC risk among people aged ≥ 20 years in Taiwan. Linkage dataset research with longitudinal design was conducted among 589,135 initially cancer-free individuals during 2000-2013; 12 airborne pollutants were identified. Several Cox models considering potential confounders were employed. The study outcomes were invasive or in situ UBC incidence over time. The targeted pollutant concentration was divided into three tertiles: T1/T2/T3. The mean age of individuals at risk was 42.5 (SD 15.7), and 50.5% of the individuals were men. The mean daily average over 10 years of airborne THC concentration was 2.25 ppm (SD 0.13), and NMHC was 0.29 ppm (SD 0.09). Both pollutants show long-term monotonic downward trend over time using the Mann-Kendall test. There was a dose-dependent increase in UBC at follow-up. UBC incidence per 100,000 enrollees according to T1/T2/T3 exposure to THC was 60.9, 221.2, and 651.8, respectively; it was 170.0/349.5/426.7 per 100,000 enrollees, corresponding to T1/T2/T3 exposure to NMHC, respectively. Without controlling for confounding air pollutants, the adjusted hazard ratio (adj.HR) was 1.83 (95% CI 1.75-1.91) per 0.13-ppm increase in THC; after controlling for PM2.5, adj.HR was even higher at 2.09 (95% CI 1.99-2.19). The adj.HR was 1.37 (95% CI 1.32-1.43) per 0.09-ppm increase in ambient NMHC concentration. After controlling for SO2 and CH4, the adj.HR was 1.10 (95% CI 1.06-1.15). Sensitivity analyses showed that UBC development risk was not sex-specific or influenced by diabetes status. Long-term exposure to THC and NMHC may be a risk factor for UBC development.

For a 75-year-old patient with PSA 4 with 2 cores of Gleason 6 PCa, URO and RO most often recommended AS (89.6% vs. 83.4%; adjusted odds ratio = 0.5; P = .07).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      RO and URO consider AS to be effective in the clinical management of low-risk PCa, but this varies by clinical and physician factors."

            "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) constitutes the most common renal cell carcinoma subtype and has long been recognized as an immunogenic cancer. As such, significant attention has been directed toward optimizing immune-checkpoints (IC)-based therapies. Despite proven benefits, a substantial number of patients remain unresponsive to treatment, suggesting that yet unreported, immunosuppressive mechanisms coexist within tumors and their microenvironment. Here, we comprehensively analyzed and ranked forty-four immune-checkpoints expressed in ccRCC on the basis of in-depth analysis of RNAseq data collected from the TCGA database and advanced statistical methods designed to obtain the group of checkpoints that best discriminates tumor from healthy tissues. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry confirmed and enlarged the bioinformatics results. In particular, by using the recursive feature elimination method, we show that HLA-G, B7H3, PDL-1 and ILT2 are the most relevant genes that characterize ccRCC. Notably, ILT2 expression was detected for the first time on tumor cells. The levels of other ligand-receptor pairs such as CD70:CD27; 4-1BB:4-1BBL; CD40:CD40L; CD86:CTLA4; MHC-II:Lag3; CD200:CD200R; CD244:CD48 were also found highly expressed in tumors compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues. Collectively, our approach provides a comprehensible classification of forty-four IC expressed in ccRCC, some of which were never reported before to be co-expressed in ccRCC. In addition, the algorithms used allowed identifying the most relevant group that best discriminates tumor from healthy tissues. The data can potentially assist on the choice of valuable immune-therapy targets which hold potential for the development of more effective anti-tumor treatments."

These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia-IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data. In addition, we could discriminate among samples from healthy, cancer-free individuals (n = 69) and those from patients with multiple types of cancer (prostate, lung, and melanoma; 100 samples in total) solely using plasma-derived, cell-free microbial nucleic acids. This potential microbiome-based oncology diagnostic tool warrants further exploration."

            "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for most malignant renal tumors and is considered the most lethal of all urologic cancers. For follow-up of patients with treated or untreated RCC and those with neoplasms suspected to represent RCC, radiologic imaging is the most valuable component of surveillance, as most relapses and cases of disease progression are identified when patients are asymptomatic. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the various imaging modalities for the detection of disease, recurrence, or progression is essential when planning follow-up regimens. This document addresses the appropriate imaging examinations for asymptomatic patients who have been treated for RCC with radical or partial nephrectomy or ablative therapies. It also discusses the appropriate imaging examinations for asymptomatic patients with localized biopsy-proven or suspected RCC undergoing active surveillance. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment."

The Jouac cohort includes 458 miners hired by the Société des Mines de Jouac between 1957 and 2001. There is no measurement of radon exposure before 1978 and so no data were available. Consequently, only the post-1977 Jouac cohort (n = 314) has been included in the French cohort, creating an extended cohort of 5400 French uranium miners followed up from 1946 to 2007. Mortality analyses computed the standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). Excess relative risks (ERRs) were assessed using Poisson regression models. No evidence of a significant excess risk of overall mortality (n = 66, SMR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.72-1.19) or any specific mortality was observed in the Jouac cohort. In the extended cohort, overall mortality did not increase, but a significant excess of deaths was observed for all cancers (SMR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.03-1.19), lung cancer (SMR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.14-1.51), and kidney cancer (SMR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.01-2.35). Cumulative exposure to radon was 3.9 working level month (WLM) and 35.1 WLM in the post-1977 Jouac and extended cohorts, respectively. Cumulative radon exposure was significantly associated with an excess risk of death from lung cancer (ERR/100 WLM = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.32-1.33) and from cerebrovascular diseases (ERR/100 WLM = 0.42 95% CI = 0.04-1.04). In conclusion, the Jouac cohort is still a young cohort and its inclusion leads to slight modifications compared to previous analyses of the French cohort. The already known relation between radon exposure and lung cancer death as well as the excess risk of death from cerebrovascular diseases persisted in the extended cohort."

Demographic, clinical and OS data were abstracted for those who underwent surgical resection. Poisson regression was performed to analyze how factors influenced LN yield. Patients with positive LNs had LN density calculated and were further analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 2340 patients met criteria, with a median age at diagnosis of 3 years (range 0-78 years). The median number of LNs examined was three (range 0-87). Lymph node yield was affected by age, race, insurance, tumor size, laterality, advanced stage, LN positivity, and institutional volume. A total of 390 (16.6%) patients had LN-positive disease. Median LN density for these LN-positive patients was 0.38 (range 0.02-1) (Summary Figure). Estimated 5-year OS was significantly improved for those with LN density ≤0.38 vs. >0.38 (94% vs. 84.6%, P = 0.012). In this population, on multivariate analysis, age and LN density were significant predictors of OS.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      It is difficult to compile large numbers of cases in rare diseases like WT, and fortunately a large administrative database such as the NCDB can serve as a great resource. However, administrative data come with inherent limitations such as missing data and inability to account for a variety of factors that may influence LN yield and/or OS (specimen designation, pathologist experience, surgeon experience/volume, institutional Children's Oncology Group (COG) association, etc.). In this specific disease, the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging (captured by the NCDB) is different than the COG WT staging system that is used clinically, and the NCDB does not capture oncologic outcomes beyond OS.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In a review of the NCDB, various factors associated with LN yield and observed LN density were identified to be significantly associated with OS in patients with LN-positive FHWT. This reinforces the need for adequate LN sampling at the time of WT surgery, to maximize surgical disease control. It was proposed that LN density as a metric may allow for improved risk-stratification, and possibly allow for therapeutic reduction in a sub-set of patients with low LN density."

Herein, we present a sensitive and specific impedimetric immunosensor for the quantitative and label free detection of Galectin-1 protein in clinical urine samples. The immunosensor consists of nine gold interdigitated microelectrodes (3 × 3 array), which can simultaneously monitor multiple immunoreactions by analyzing the normalized impedance variations at each microelectrode during immunosensing. To obtain enhanced sensitivities, we have utilized Galectin-1/Al2O3 nanoprobes (Galectin-1 antibody conjugated to alumina nanoparticles) that can be selectively trapped on the microelectrode surface using positive dielectrophoresis (p-DEP). Preliminary studies highlight the feasibility of the proposed immunosensor for Gal -1 detection in T24 cell lysate spiked phosphate buffer saline and artificial urine samples with a limit of detection that is estimated to be in the pg/ml range. To verify its practical feasibility, we have tested the immunosensor for Galectin-1 detection in clinical urine samples obtained from normal patients and those diagnosed with bladder cancer. Analysis of the clinical tests shows that the median normalized impedance variation during immunosensing for 22 cancer patients and 26 normal patients is 27% and 10%, respectively, with an identified cutoff point of 19.5% above which the sensitivity and specificity of bladder cancer detection was 82.1% and 80.8%, respectively. Based on these results, the proposed immunosensor shows promise for bladder cancer diagnosis and prognosis in a point of care format, thus enabling improved public health monitoring."

In Hong Kong, most people live and work in urban or suburban areas with high-rise buildings. This facilitates the estimation of PM2.5 exposure of individuals, taking into account the height of residence above ground level for assessment of the long-term health effects with sufficient statistical power.\n## METHODS\nWe recruited 66,820 persons who were ≥65 in 1998 to 2001 and followed up for mortality outcomes until 2011. Annual concentrations of PM at their residential addresses were estimated using PM2.5 concentrations measured at fixed-site monitors, horizontal-vertical locations, and satellite data. We used Cox regression model to assess the HR of mortality for cancer per 10 μg/m(3) increase of PM2.5 RESULTS: PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of mortality for all causes of cancer [HR, 1.22 (95% CI, 1.11-1.34)] and for specific cause of cancer in upper digestive tract [1.42 (1.06-1.89)], digestive accessory organs [1.35 (1.06-1.71)] in all subjects; breast [1.80 (1.26-2.55)] in females; and lung [1.36 (1.05-1.77)] in males.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nLong-term exposures to PM2.5 are associated with elevated risks of cancer in various organs.\n## IMPACT\nThis study is particularly timely in China, where compelling evidence is needed to support the pollution control policy to ameliorate the health damages associated with economic growth.

GLUT2 (control vs T2DM: 1.00 [0.69] vs 0.49 [0.36]) and GLUT1 expression (control vs T2DM: 0.86 [0.73] vs 0.35 [0.30]; P = .0007 for both) were closely correlated with those of the respective SGLT partner. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, more abundant in control than T2DM tissue, might be a transcription factor involved in the modulation of SGLT2 expression.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      In whole renal tissue, expressions of SGLT2/GLUT2 and SGLT1/GLUT1 are coupled and slightly lower in typical people with T2DM as compared with well-matched people without diabetes."

In addition, some of these patients are lost to long-term postoperative follow-up. We reviewed the treatment results and prognosis of postoperative patients with RCC at Chiba University Hospital, with the aim of clarifying the proportion and background of patients lost to follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective study included 1176 RCC patients who underwent radical or/and partial nephrectomy. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and lost follow-up free survival (LFFS) were evaluated and the risk factors for LFFS identified.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median RFS for stage II and II cases was 188.3 and 104.0 months, respectively. Even in stage I, recurrence was observed in about 20% of patients 20 years after surgery. The Kaplan-Meier curve for LFFS showed a linear descent over time, with 50% of patients lost to follow-up within 25 years. Older age (≥ 62 years), histological type (clear cell RCC), and no recurrence were significant risk factors for lost follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Long-term follow-up is necessary after RCC surgery because late recurrence cases are not uncommon.

However, screening is invasive, expensive, and associated with significant morbidity making bladder cancer the most expensive cancer to treat per capita. There is an urgent need to expand the understanding of markers related to recurrence and survival outcomes of NMIBC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods and results:\n        \n      \n      We used the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array to measure peripheral blood DNA methylation profiles of NMIBC patients (N = 603) enrolled in a population-based cohort study in New Hampshire and applied cell type deconvolution to estimate immune cell-type proportions. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we identified that increasing CD4T and CD8T cell proportions were associated with a statistically significant decreased hazard of tumor recurrence or death (CD4T: HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97-1.00; CD8T: HR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-1.00), whereas increasing monocyte proportion and methylation-derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (mdNLR) were associated with the increased hazard of tumor recurrence or death (monocyte: HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.00-1.07; mdNLR: HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.04-1.20). Then, using an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) approach adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, BCG treatment status, and immune cell profiles, we identified 2528 CpGs associated with the hazard of tumor recurrence or death (P < 0.005). Among these CpGs, the 1572 were associated with an increased hazard and were significantly enriched in open sea regions; the 956 remaining CpGs were associated with a decreased hazard and were significantly enriched in enhancer regions and DNase hypersensitive sites.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Our results expand on the knowledge of immune profiles and methylation alteration associated with NMIBC outcomes and represent a first step toward the development of DNA methylation-based biomarkers of tumor recurrence."

            "abstract": "Background: Previous studies have identified apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can stratify prostate cancer into high- and low-grade disease (HG and LG, respectively). In this study, we consider the improvement of incorporating texture features (TFs) from T2-weighted (T2w) multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) relative to mpMRI alone to predict HG and LG disease. Material and methods: In vivo mpMRI was acquired from 30 patients prior to radical prostatectomy. Sequences included T2w imaging, DWI and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI. In vivo mpMRI data were co-registered with 'ground truth' histology. Tumours were delineated on the histology with Gleason scores (GSs) and classed as HG if GS ≥ 4 + 3, or LG if GS ≤ 3 + 4. Texture features based on three statistical families, namely the grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), grey-level run length matrix (GLRLM) and the grey-level size zone matrix (GLSZM), were computed from T2w images. Logistic regression models were trained using different feature subsets to classify each lesion as either HG or LG. To avoid overfitting, fivefold cross validation was applied on feature selection, model training and performance evaluation. Performance of all models generated was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) method. Results: Consistent with previous studies, ADC was found to discriminate between HG and LG with an AUC of 0.76. Of the three statistical TF families, GLCM (plus select mpMRI features including ADC) scored the highest AUC (0.84) with GLRLM plus mpMRI similarly performing well (AUC = 0.82). When all TFs were considered in combination, an AUC of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.95) was achieved. Conclusions: Incorporating T2w TFs significantly improved model performance for classifying prostate tumour aggressiveness. This result, however, requires further validation in a larger patient cohort."

            "abstract": "Given the importance of gland morphology in grading prostate cancer (PCa), automatically differentiating between epithelium and other tissues is an important prerequisite for the development of automated methods for detecting PCa. We propose a new deep learning method to segment epithelial tissue in digitised hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained prostatectomy slides using immunohistochemistry (IHC) as reference standard. We used IHC to create a precise and objective ground truth compared to manual outlining on H&E slides, especially in areas with high-grade PCa. 102 tissue sections were stained with H&E and subsequently restained with P63 and CK8/18 IHC markers to highlight epithelial structures. Afterwards each pair was co-registered. First, we trained a U-Net to segment epithelial structures in IHC using a subset of the IHC slides that were preprocessed with color deconvolution. Second, this network was applied to the remaining slides to create the reference standard used to train a second U-Net on H&E. Our system accurately segmented both intact glands and individual tumour epithelial cells. The generalisation capacity of our system is shown using an independent external dataset from a different centre. We envision this segmentation as the first part of a fully automated prostate cancer grading pipeline."

Radiomics allows an in-depth characterization of heterogeneity across the tumor, but its incremental value to the existing prognostic models for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the radiomics-based tumor heterogeneity and postoperative risk of recurrence in localized ccRCC, and to assess its incremental value to UISS and SSIGN.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A multicenter 866 ccRCC patients derived from 12 Chinese hospitals were studied. The endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). A CT-based radiomics signature (RS) was developed and assessed in the whole cohort and in the subgroups stratified by UISS and SSIGN. Two combined nomograms, the R-UISS (combining RS and UISS) and R-SSIGN (combining RS and SSIGN), were developed. The incremental value of RS to UISS and SSIGN in RFS prediction was evaluated. R statistical software was used for statistics.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Patients with low radiomics scores were 4.44 times more likely to experience recurrence than those with high radiomics scores (P<0.001). Stratified analysis suggested the association is significant among low- and intermediate-risk patients identified by UISS and SSIGN. The R-UISS and R-SSIGN showed better predictive capability than UISS and SSIGN did with higher C-indices (R-UISS vs. UISS, 0.74 vs. 0.64; R-SSIGN vs. SSIGN, 0.78 vs. 0.76) and higher clinical net benefit.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The radiomics-based tumor heterogeneity can predict outcome and add incremental value to the existing prognostic models in localized ccRCC patients.

PET/CT data were co-registered with mpMRI via the CT scan and an in vivo three-dimensional T2-weighted (T2w) MRI, and then co-registered with ground truth histology data using ex vivo MRI of the prostate specimen. Maximum and mean standardised uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean ) were extracted from PET data using tumour annotations from histology, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to compare between tumour- and benign-voxel values.

We examined VSIG1 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression in 105 consecutive samples provided by HCC patients, along with the IHC expression of three of the biomarkers known to be involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT): vimentin (VIM), and E- and N-cadherin (encoded by CDH1 and CDH2 genes). IHC subcellular localization of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), in which nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation is known to cause a lineage shift from lung to gastric-type adenocarcinoma, was also checked. The obtained data were validated using the miRNET program. In the examined HCC samples, VSIG1 expression was observed in the cytoplasm of normal hepatocytes and downregulated in 47 of the 105 HCCs (44.76%). In 29 cases (27.62%), VSIG1 was co-expressed with cytoplasmic TTF1. VSIG1 expression was positively correlated with both E-cadherin and N-cadherin and negatively correlated with VIM (p < 0.0001). The VSIG1+/E-cadherin+/N-cadherin-/VIM phenotype was seen in 13 cases (12.4%) and was characteristic of well-differentiated (G1/2) carcinomas diagnosed in pT1/2 stages. Like pulmonary carcinomas, simultaneous cytoplasmic positivity of HCC cells for VSIG1 and TTF1 may be a potential indicator of a lineage shift from conventional to gastric-type HCC. The E-cadherin/VSIG1 complex can help suppress tumor growth by limiting HCC dedifferentiation. The miRNET-based interaction between VSIG1/VIM/CDH1/CDH2 genes might be interconnected by miR-200b-3p, a central regulator of EMT which also targets VIM and VSIG1."

            "abstract": "SELENOF is a member of the class of selenoproteins in which the amino acid selenocysteine is co-translationally inserted into the elongating peptide in response to an in-frame UGA codon located in the 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) region of the SELENOF mRNA. Polymorphisms in the 3'-UTR are associated with an increased risk of dying from prostate cancer and these variations are functional and 10 times more frequent in the genomes of African American men. SELENOF is dramatically reduced in prostate cancer compared to benign adjacent regions. Using a prostate cancer tissue microarray, it was previously established that the reduction of SELENOF in the cancers from African American men was significantly greater than in cancers from Caucasian men. When SELENOF levels in human prostate immortalized epithelial cells were reduced with an shRNA construct, those cells acquired the ability to grow in soft agar, increased the ability to migrate in a scratch assay and acquired features of energy metabolism associated with prostate cancer. These results support a role of SELENOF loss in prostate cancer progression and further indicate that SELENOF loss and genotype may contribute to the disparity in prostate cancer mortality experienced by African American men."

So, it is meaningful to explore novel immunotherapy or combination therapy for improving therapeutic efficacy. HHLA2, a newly discovered B7 family member, is prevalently expressed in numerous tumors, including ccRCC. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic impact of HHLA2/PD-L1 co-expression and its relationship with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The expression levels of HHLA2, PD-L1, CD8, and CD4 in cancer tissues from cases (206 in the training cohort and 197 in the validation cohort) with surgically resectable primary ccRCC were evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The positive rates of HHLA2 were much higher than those of PD-L1 in ccRCC tissues.

Moreover, patients with HHLA2/PD-L1 co-expression suffered the highest risk of disease progression and death by a significant margin.

We simultaneously examined the additive associations of six exposures, namely, moving average exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 over the year of diagnosis and previous 2 years, previous 3 to 5 years, and previous 6 to 10 years, with the risk of first cancer diagnosis after 10 years of follow-up, during which there was no cancer diagnosis.\n## Results:\nThe cohorts included 2.2 to 6.5 million subjects for different cancers. Exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2 was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, while the association for PM2.5 remained inconclusive. At exposure levels below the newly updated World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline, we observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the risks of all cancers, which were translated to hundreds to thousands new cancer cases per year within the cohort per unit increase in each exposure.\n## Conclusions:\nThese findings suggested substantial cancer burden was associated with exposures to PM2.5 and NO2, emphasizing the urgent need for strategies to mitigate air pollution levels."

            "abstract": "Glabridin is a prenylated isoflavonoid with considerable anticancer property. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have evolved as regulators of many cellular signaling pathways in prostate cancer (PC). However, the role of ROS signaling in the anticancer activity of glabridin has not been investigated. Here, we attempted to evaluate the effect of glabridin on PC and the involvement of ROS signaling. Intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) production in PC cell lines, DU-145 and LNCaP, were measured by H2DCFDA and MitoSOX Red staining, respectively. MTT assay was used to analyze the cellular viability. EdU staining assay was conducted to analyze the cell proliferation. To analyze apoptotic rate, TUNEL assay was performed. Caspase-3 activity was detected to reflect cell apoptosis. Western blot was carried out to detect the expression levels of Akt and p-Akt. We found that intracellular ROS and mitoROS levels were dose-dependently upregulated after glabridin treatment in both DU-145 and LNCaP cells, which was reversed by the treatment of ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Glabridin inhibited the cell viability and reduced the number of EdU-positive DU-145 and LNCaP cells, which were respectively proved by MTT assay and EdU staining assay. Glabridin promoted cell death with increased apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity in DU-145 and LNCaP cells. The effects of glabridin on cell proliferation and apoptosis were reversed by NAC. Moreover, glabridin suppressed the ratio of p-Akt/Akt, while NAC mitigated the decreased p-Akt/Akt ratio. In addition, the effects of glabridin on cell proliferation and apoptosis were also attenuated by Akt activator, SC79. Collectively, our results demonstrated that glabridin suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in PC cells via regulating ROS-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway. These findings suggested that glabridin might hold a promising prospective as a therapeutic agent against PC."

With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, there was no survival difference between groups: 5- and 10-year OS 27.4% (95% CI 23.4%-31.4%) in the BO group vs. 31.9% (95% CI 29.3%-34.6%) in the BPN group, and 13.1% (95% CI 9.7%-17.1%) in the BO group vs. 13.2% (95% CI 10.6%-16.0%) in the BPN group, respectively (log-rank P = 0.10). On multivariable analysis, there was no significant association between BPN and OS (adjusted HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81-1.02, P = 0.09). On sensitivity analysis, we found no differential effect by T stage or radiation modality.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Use of pelvic lymph node radiation has risen in the US but may not impact long-term survival outcomes for patients with node-negative muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Optimizing radiation treatment volumes for CRT for MIBC will be important to study under prospective trials, such as the SWOG/NRG 1806."

Biomarkers that have practical value in prognosis stratification are increasingly needed. Our study aimed to select a set of BC (bladder cancer)-related genes involved in both platinum resistance and survival, then use these genes to establish the prognostic model.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      Platinum resistance-related DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and tumorigenesis-related DEGs were identified. Ten most predictive co-DEGs were acquired followed by building a risk score model. Survival analysis and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plot were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy. Combined with age and tumor stages, a nomogram was generated to create a graphical representation of survival rates at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-year in BC patients. The prognostic performance was validated in three independent BC datasets with platinum-based chemotherapy. The potential mechanism was explored by enrichment analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      PPP2R2B, TSPAN7, ATAD3C, SYT15, SAPCD1, AKR1B1, TCHH, AKAP12, AGLN3, and IGF2 were selected for our prognostic model.

Patients treated with total nephroureterectomy or segmental ureterectomy for presumably infiltrative (≥ T1) UTUC managed at the Saint-Louis Hospital were included from January 2019 to July 2020. A set of markers and immune checkpoints were studied by flow fluorocytometry on circulating lymphocytes (PBMCs) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

Silica dust exposure from pitchblende processing was estimated (n = 1317). Vital status and cause of death determination through 2019 relied upon the National Death Index and Social Security Administration Epidemiological Vital Status Service.

For a dose weighting factor of 1 for intakes of uranium, radium, and radon decay products, the mean and median lung doses were 65.6 and 29.9 mGy, respectively. SMRs indicated a difference in health outcomes between salaried and hourly workers, and more brain cancer deaths than expected [SMR: 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.70]. No association was seen between radiation and lung cancer [hazard ratio (HR) at 100 mGy: 0.93; 95%CI: 0.78, 1.11].

There was an excess of brain cancers compared with the US population, although no radiation dose-response was detected. The association between radiation and kidney cancer remained, though potentially due to few cases at higher doses. The association between levels of silica dust ≥23.6 mg/m3-year and NMKD also remained. No association was observed between radiation and lung cancer. A positive dose-response was observed between radiation and CVD; however, this association may be confounded by smoking, which was unmeasured.

We enrolled 63 patients with mRCC treated with axitinib as first-line therapy between Nov. 2003 and Jul. 2018. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Wald χ2 statistic in Cox proportional hazards regression. Median patient age was 67 (range: 25-85) years.

Median follow-up duration after axitinib initiation was 14 (range: 1-72) months. Median PFS and OS were 18 months and 65 months, respectively. Cox regression analyses of clinical predictors revealed that high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly correlated with shorter PFS [hazard ratio (HR), 1.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-4.0)], whereas spindle cells and poor IMDC risk scores were related to worse OS (HR, 2.87 and 2.88, respectively; 95% CI 1.4-11.0 and 1.1-8.5, respectively).

Patients were categorized based on whether they did or did not receive palliative care. Palliative care was cataloged as pain management therapy, surgery, radiation or systemic treatment, any combination therapy or not otherwise specified (NOS). Our primary outcome was receiving palliative therapy. Secondary outcome was the temporal trends in palliative care. Logistic regression (LR) was performed.\n    \n\n\n          Results obtained:\n        \n      \n      385 and 279 patients were identified with locally advanced and metastatic penile cancer respectively. 27 (7.1%) and 49 (17.6%) patients received palliative care. Average age of patients accepting palliative care was 61.9 years old, about 5 years younger than their counterparts who declined therapy (p < 0.011) in the metastatic cohort. Other patient specific demographics and clinical tumor characteristics were not significantly different in either population. Of patients with locally advanced disease pursuing palliative therapy, radiation (29.6%), surgery (14.8%), systemic treatment (14.8%) and combination treatment (22.2%) were the more popular choices. In the metastatic population, radiation (32.7%) and systemic therapy (24.5%) were the most prevalent choices for palliative treatment followed by combination treatment (16.3%), surgery (12.2%), pain management (10.2%), or NOS (4.1%). LR for the receipt of \"any palliative therapy\" revealed that increasing age (OR 0.971, p = 0.032) decreased the likelihood of accepting palliative therapy in the metastatic population but not in the locally advanced group.

Its use is more common in younger patients, those with co-morbidities and/or those of black race in the metastatic group. Locally advanced patients with low income or comorbidities were also more likely to opt for palliative therapy. Receipt of palliative care did not affect mortality.

Secondary outcomes were time to first bowel movement, time to tolerate a regular diet, the incidence of postoperative ileus, postoperative complications and 30-day readmission rate.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Group C showed a significantly shorter median length of hospital stay (7 days, P = 0.003), shorter gastrointestinal recovery time (4 days, P = 0.018) and a lower rate of postoperative ileus (14.6%, P = 0.005). The reduction in length of hospital stay, gastrointestinal recovery time and a lower rate of postoperative ileus was significant after controlling for other confounders on multivariable regression analysis. With the open approach, group C showed a significantly shorter length of hospital stay and gastrointestinal recovery time (P = 0.005, P = 0.001, respectively); however, in robotic cohorts, no significant differences were observed. There was no difference among groups in the 30-day readmission rate or postoperative complications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Patients undergoing radical cystectomy and managed by an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocol experience a significantly shorter length of hospital stay when receiving alvimopan as part of the protocol. Patients seem to derive the optimum benefits of alvimopan when it is used with an open approach; however, these benefits become less obvious with the robotic approach."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Fibronectin (FN) is associated with tumorigenesis and progression in bladder cancer, however, the underlying mechanisms causing this remain largely unknown. Furthermore, cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) has been shown to play important regulatory roles in cancer proliferation. Here, we investigated whether FN regulates CIP2A expression to promote bladder cancer cell proliferation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The correlations of stromal FN with CIP2A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression were analyzed in a cohort bladder cancer patients. The roles of FN and CIP2A in regulating bladder cancer cell proliferation were evaluated in cell and animal models. Cycloheximide treatment was used to determine the effects of CIP2A on β-catenin stabilization. The CIP2A-β-catenin interaction was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprcipitation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In this study, we found that stromal FN expression correlated positively with the levels of CIP2A and PCNA in bladder cancer tissues. Meanwhile, in human bladder cancer cell lines (T24 and J82), exogenous FN significantly promoted cell proliferation, however, CIP2A depletion inhibited this process. Furthermore, the interaction between CIP2A and β-catenin enhanced the stabilization of β-catenin, which was involved in FN-induced cell proliferation. In vivo, CIP2A depletion repressed FN-accelerated subcutaneous xenograft growth rates.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      These data reveal that CIP2A is a crucial mediator of FN-induced bladder cancer cell proliferation via enhancing the stabilization of β-catenin.

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to nivolumab (240 mg) intravenously every 2 weeks plus cabozantinib (40 mg) orally once daily or sunitinib (50 mg orally) once daily (4 weeks per 6-week cycle). Randomisation, stratified by IMDC risk status, tumour PD-L1 expression, and geographical region, was done by permuted block within each stratum using a block size of four, via an interactive response system. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review. Overall survival was a secondary endpoint (reported here as the preplanned final analysis according to the protocol).

            "abstract": "Patients with prostate cancer with tumors harboring defects in DNA-repair genes (DRD) generally do not respond well to AR-directed therapy. Furthermore, canonical pathways evolve during disease progression and may affect treatment with existing therapies. Due to the limited treatment options after failure of hormonal and taxane therapy, and the tumor heterogeneity induced by DRD, we sought to characterize the alterations in primary and metastatic prostate cancer. Tumors from 1,027 patients with advanced prostate cancer that underwent comprehensive genomic profiling for routine clinical care were reviewed to assess DRD mutation rates (27-gene panel) and co-occurring mutations in select canonical prostate cancer pathways. DRD alterations were identified in 20 genes and in 17% of patients (BRCA2 and ATM most common) occurring with slightly higher frequency in specimens from metastatic biopsy sites and men older than 50 years of age. Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and tumor mutational burden-high occurred with 3% frequency in the overall cohort but were not enriched in metastatic disease. Biomarkers previously associated with antitumor immunity are found at high frequencies in MSI-H patients, including JAK1 (68%) and PTEN (32%). Lastly, mutations in TP53, AR, PTEN, APC, CTNNB1, and PIK3CA were all significantly enriched in metastatic samples. We identified clinically significant subgroups of patients demonstrating (1) defects in DNA-repair pathways, (2) intrinsic prostate cancer signaling pathways that may prevent antitumor immunity, and (3) distinct genomic differences between localized and metastatic prostate cancer. These results lend support that genomic profiling for advanced prostate cancer may identify actionable targets not routinely used in the current metastatic paradigm."

Genome-wide DNA methylation screening was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, and DNA methylation quantification was verified using pyrosequencing. We analysed 26 samples of normal control urothelial tissue (C), an initial cohort of 62 samples (31 samples of non-cancerous urothelium [N] from UTUC patients and 31 samples of the corresponding UTUCs), a validation cohort of 82 samples (41 N and 41 UTUC samples), and 14 samples of urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC). In the initial cohort, we identified 2,448 CpG sites showing significant differences in DNA methylation levels between both C and UTUC and N and UTUC, but not showing differences between C and N. Among these CpG sites, 10 were located within CpG islands or their shores and shelves included in genomic domains where DNA methylation levels are stably controlled, allowing discrimination of UTUC even from BUC. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for discrimination of UTUC from N in these 10 CpG and neighbouring sites (37 diagnostic panels in total) yielded area under the curve values of 0.959-1.000, with a sensitivity and specificity of 86.6-100% and 93.5-100%, respectively. The diagnostic impact was successfully confirmed in the validation cohort. Our criteria were useful for diagnosis of UTUC, regardless of its clinicopathological features. Application of our criteria to voided urine samples will ultimately allow non-invasive DNA methylation diagnosis of UTUC."

With increasing efforts to move the field of EVs to clinical applications, the lack of a practical EV isolation method from circulating biofluids with high throughput and good reproducibility has become one of the biggest barriers. Here, we introduce a magnetic bead-based EV enrichment approach (EVrich) for automated and high-throughput processing of urine samples. Parallel enrichments can be performed in 96-well plates for downstream cargo analysis, including EV characterization, miRNA, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis. We applied the instrument to a cohort of clinical urine samples to achieve reproducible identification of an average of 17,000 unique EV peptides and an average of 2800 EV proteins in each 1 mL urine sample. Quantitative phosphoproteomics revealed 186 unique phosphopeptides corresponding to 48 proteins that were significantly elevated in prostate cancer patients. Among them, multiple phosphoproteins were previously reported to associate with prostate cancer. Together, EVrich represents a universal, scalable, and simple platform for EV isolation, enabling downstream EV cargo analyses for a broad range of research and clinical applications."

The comparison randomised patients 1:1 to SOC-alone with or without daily abiraterone acetate 1000 mg + prednisolone 5 mg (SOC + AAP), continued until disease progression. The primary outcome measure was overall survival. Metastatic disease risk group was classified retrospectively using baseline CT and bone scans by central radiological review and pathology reports.

Here, we explored molecular, clinical, and histological data of The Cancer Genome Atlas, as well as the IMvigor210 dataset to study factors associated with TLS development and function in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of MIBC. We also analyzed tumor immune composition including TLS in an independent, retrospective MIBC cohort. We found that the combination of TLS density and tumor mutational burden provides a novel independent prognostic biomarker in MIBC. Gene expression profiles obtained from intratumoral regions that rarely contain TLS in MIBC showed poor correlation with the prognostic TLS density measured in tumor periphery. Tumors with high TLS density showed increased gene signatures as well as infiltration of activated lymphocytes. Intratumoral B-cell and CD8+ T-cell co-infiltration was frequent in TLS-high samples, and such regions harbored the highest proportion of PD-1+TCF1+ progenitor-like T cells, naïve T cells, and activated B cells when compared to regions predominantly infiltrated by either B cells or CD8+ T cells alone. We found four TLS maturation subtypes; however, differences in TLS composition appeared to be dictated by the TME and not by the TLS maturation status. Finally, we identified one downregulated and three upregulated non-immune cell-related genes in TME with high TLS density, which may represent candidates for tumor-intrinsic regulation of lymphoid neogenesis. Our study provides novel insights into TLS-associated gene expression and immune contexture of MIBC and indicates towards the relevance of B-cell and CD8+ T-cell interactions in anti-tumor immunity within and outside TLS."

            "abstract": "Prostate cancer genomic subtypes that stratify aggressive disease and inform treatment decisions at the primary stage are currently limited. Previously, we functionally validated an aggressive subtype present in 15% of prostate cancer characterized by dual deletion of MAP3K7 and CHD1. Recent studies in the field have focused on deletion of CHD1 and its role in androgen receptor (AR) chromatin distribution and resistance to AR-targeted therapy; however, CHD1 is rarely lost without codeletion of MAP3K7. Here, we show that in the clinically relevant context of co-loss of MAP3K7 and CHD1 there are significant, collective changes to aspects of AR signaling. Although CHD1 loss mainly impacts the expansion of the AR cistrome, loss of MAP3K7 drives increased AR target gene expression. Prostate cancer cell line models engineered to cosuppress MAP3K7 and CHD1 also demonstrated increased AR-v7 expression and resistance to the AR-targeting drug enzalutamide. Furthermore, we determined that low protein expression of both genes is significantly associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) in a clinical cohort of radical prostatectomy specimens. Low MAP3K7 expression, however, was the strongest independent predictor for risk of BCR over all other tested clinicopathologic factors including CHD1 expression. Collectively, these findings illustrate the importance of MAP3K7 loss in a molecular subtype of prostate cancer that poses challenges to conventional therapeutic approaches. IMPLICATIONS: These findings strongly implicate MAP3K7 loss as a biomarker for aggressive prostate cancer with significant risk for recurrence that poses challenges for conventional androgen receptor-targeted therapies."

In the context of prostate cancer (PCa), some studies have correlated gross histological measurements of gland lumen, epithelium, and nuclei with disease appearance on MRI. Quantitative histomorphometry (QH), like radiomics for radiologic images, is the computer based extraction of features for describing tumor morphology on digitized tissue images. In this work, we attempt to establish the histomorphometric basis for radiomic features for prostate cancer by (1) identifying the radiomic features from T2w MRI most discriminating of low vs. intermediate/high Gleason score, (2) identifying QH features correlated with the most discriminating radiomic features previously identified, and (3) evaluating the discriminative ability of QH features found to be correlated with spatially co-localized radiomic features. On a cohort of 36 patients (23 for training, 13 for validation), Gabor texture features were identified as being most predictive of Gleason grade on MRI (AUC of 0.69) and gland lumen shape features were identified as the most predictive QH features (AUC = 0.75).

Such an early diagnosis of metastatic CRPC may allow patients to be referred for metastasis-directed therapies (i.e. stereotactic body radiotherapy), aimed at prolonging the efficacy of systemic therapies and improving clinical outcomes. However, current data are not strong enough to recommend this strategy, which must be properly evaluated in clinical trials. Indeed, the use of molecular imaging may lead to inappropriate undertreatment if the second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors (darolutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide), which prolong life, are not used in the subgroup of patients with high PSA velocity (PSA doubling time <10 months).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Implementation of PSMA-PET/CT in the staging strategy would result in a migration of disease stage to extra-pelvic, M1 disease in at least half of presumed nmCRPC patients. The unprecedented accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT may pave the way for a more personalized treatment strategy. However, no data yet support this strategy for all nmCRPC patients as no oncologic benefit of early detection of M1 disease or MDT has been demonstrated. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

            "abstract": "Background: Recurrence of renal cell cancer (RCC) affects approximately one-third of patients after curative nephrectomy. However, studies from the Indian subcontinent have been scarce. We here ddetermine relapse rates and patterns in an Indian cohort. Methods: This study included all patients with RCC who underwent nephrectomy from 2004 to 2013 at our centre. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the date of surgery to date of recurrence or death. The Cox regression model was applied to identify significant prognostic factors. Results: Overall a total of 292 patients were included. Median age was 50 years (range 19-84 years), with a male:female ratio of 3:1. Radical and partial nephrectomy were performed for 276 (94.5%) and 16 (5.5%) patients, respectively. Clear cell was most common histological subtype (71.2%) and T1, T2, T3 and T4 stages accounted for 89 (30.5%), 86 (29.5%), 105 (36%) and 12 (4.1%) patients, respectively. One hundred and thirty-six patients (46.6%) demonstrated recurrence. Eighty-six (63.2%) relapsed at distant sites, 14 (10.3%) and at locoregional sites whereas 36(26.5%) had both distant and locoregional recurrence. Median time to recurrence was 18 months. Approximately 17.7% of cases had disease reappearance after five years. Factors predicting shorter RFS on multivariate analysis were patient reported weight loss (p=0.004), Fuhrman grade 3 or 4 (p<0.0001), presence of necrosis (p<0.0001) and higher tumour stage (p=0.005). Conclusion: Compared to previous studies, our patients had higher rates of recurrence in general and locoregional recurrence in particular. However, except for weight loss, other predictive factors remain similar. Finding weight loss as the marker of recurrence emphasises the importance of the simple task of history taking."

Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments beyond hormonal manipulation. We sought to identify activated kinases in mCRPC as therapeutic targets for existing, approved agents, with the goal of identifying candidate drugs for rapid translation into proof of concept Phase II trials in mCRPC.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      To identify evidence of activation of druggable kinases in these patients, we compared mRNA expression from metastatic biopsies of patients with mCRPC (n = 101) to mRNA expression in localized prostate from TCGA and used this analysis to infer differential kinase activity. In addition, we assessed the differential phosphorylation levels for key MAPK pathway kinases between mCRPC and localized prostate cancers.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Transcriptomic profiling of 101 patients with mCRPC as compared to patients with localized prostate cancer identified evidence of hyperactive ERK1, and whole genome sequencing revealed frequent amplifications of members of the MAPK pathway in 32% of this cohort. Next, we confirmed elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 in castration resistant prostate cancer as compared to untreated primary prostate cancer. We observed that the presence of detectable phosphorylated ERK1/2 in the primary tumor is associated with biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy independent of clinicopathologic features. ERK1 is the immediate downstream target of MEK1/2, which is druggable with trametinib, an approved therapeutic for melanoma. Trametinib elicited a profound biochemical and clinical response in a patient who had failed multiple prior treatments for mCRPC.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      We conclude that pharmacologic targeting of the MEK/ERK pathway may be a viable treatment strategy for patients with refractory metastatic prostate cancer.

This study is designed to identify the related predictive risk factors for complications in patients following RRP. Between 2000 and 2012 in Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, 421 cases undergoing RRP for localized prostate cancer by one surgeon were included in this retrospective analysis. We reviewed various risk factors that were correlated with perioperative complications, including patient characteristics [age, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities], clinical findings (preoperative PSA level, Gleason score, clinical stage, pathological grade), and surgeon's own clinical practice. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to explain comorbidities. The total rate of perioperative complications was 23.2% (98/421). There were 45/421 (10.7%), 28/421 (6.6%), 24/421 (5.7%) and 1/421 (0.2%) in grade I, II, III, IV respectively, and 323/421 (76.8%) cases had none of these complications. Statistical analysis of multiple potential risk factors revealed that BMI >30 (P=0.014), Charlson score ≥1 (P<0.001) and surgical experience (P=0.0252) were predictors of perioperative complications. Age, PSA level, Gleason score, TNM stage, operation time, blood loss, and blood transfusion were not correlated with perioperative complications (P>0.05). It was concluded that patients' own factors and surgeons' technical factors are related with an increased risk of development of perioperative complications following radical prostatectomy. Knowing these predictors can both favor risk stratification of patients undergoing RRP and help surgeons make treatment decisions."

            "abstract": "In many countries, specialist cancer services are centralised to improve outcomes. We explored how centralisation affects the radical treatment of high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer in the English NHS. 79,085 patients diagnosed with high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer in England (April 2014 to March 2016) were identified in the National Prostate Cancer Audit database. Poisson models were used to estimate risk ratios (RR) for undergoing radical treatment by whether men were diagnosed at a regional co-ordinating centre ('hub'), for having surgery by the presence of surgical services on-site, and for receiving high dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in addition to external beam radiotherapy by its regional availability. Men were equally likely to receive radical treatment, irrespective of whether they were diagnosed in a hub (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91-1.08). Men were more likely to have surgery if they were diagnosed at a hospital with surgical services on site (RR 1.24, 1.10-1.40), and more likely to receive additional HDR-BT if they were diagnosed at a hospital with direct regional access to this service (RR 6.16, 2.94-12.92). Centralisation of specialist cancer services does not affect whether men receive radical treatment, but it does affect treatment modality. Centralisation may have a negative impact on access to specific treatment modalities."

            "abstract": "An automated approach based on routinely-processed, whole-slide immunohistochemistry (IHC) was implemented to study co-localized protein expression in tissue samples. Expression of two markers was chosen to represent stromal (CD31) and epithelial (Ki-67) compartments in prostate cancer. IHC was performed on whole-slide sections representing low-, intermediate-, and high-grade disease from 15 patients. The automated workflow was developed using a training set of regions-of-interest in sequential tissue sections. Protein expression was studied on digital representations of IHC images across entire slides representing formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks. Using the training-set, the known association between Ki-67 and Gleason grade was confirmed. CD31 expression was more heterogeneous across samples and remained invariant with grade in this cohort. Interestingly, the Ki-67/CD31 ratio was significantly increased in high (Gleason ≥ 8) versus low/intermediate (Gleason ≤7) samples when assessed in the training-set and the whole-tissue block images. Further, the feasibility of the automated approach to process Tissue Microarray (TMA) samples in high throughput was evaluated. This work establishes an initial framework for automated analysis of co-localized protein expression and distribution in high-resolution digital microscopy images based on standard IHC techniques. Applied to a larger sample population, the approach may help to elucidate the biologic basis for the Gleason grade, which is the strongest, single factor distinguishing clinically aggressive from indolent prostate cancer."

            "abstract": "With 46 microRNAs (miRNAs) embedded tandemly over a distance of ~100 kb, chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC) is the largest miRNA cluster in the human genome. The C19MC is transcribed from a long noncoding genomic region and is usually expressed simultaneously at a higher level. Hence, we performed an integrative multiomics data analysis to examine C19MC regulation, expression patterns, and their impact on bladder cancer (BCa). We found that 43 members of C19MC were highly expressed in BCa. However, its co-localization with recurrent copy number variation (CNV) gain was not statistically significant to implicate its upregulation. It has been reported that C19MC expression is regulated by a well-established CpG island situated 17.6 kb upstream of the transcription start site, but we found that CpG probes at this island were hypomethylated, which was not statistically significant in the BCa cohort. In addition, the promoter region of C19MC is strongly regulated by a group of seven transcription factors (NR2F6, SREBF1, TBP, GATA3, GABPB1, ETV4, and ZNF444) and five chromatin modifiers (SMC3, KDMA1, EZH2, RAD21, and CHD7). Interestingly, these 12 genes were found to be overexpressed in BCa patients. Further, C19MC targeted 42 tumor suppressor (TS) genes that were downregulated, of which 15 were significantly correlated with patient survival. Our findings suggest that transcription factors and chromatin modifiers at the promoter region may regulate C19MC overexpression. The upregulated C19MC members, transcription regulators, and TS genes can be further exploited as potential diagnostic and prognostic indicators as well as for therapeutic management of BCa."

            "abstract": "Lymphatic spread determines treatment decisions in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT can be performed, although cost remains high and availability is limited. Therefore, computed tomography (CT) continues to be the most used modality for PCa staging. We assessed if convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be trained to determine 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT-lymph node status from CT alone. In 549 patients with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT imaging, 2616 lymph nodes were segmented. Using PET as a reference standard, three CNNs were trained. Training sets balanced for infiltration status, lymph node location and additionally, masked images, were used for training. CNNs were evaluated using a separate test set and performance was compared to radiologists' assessments and random forest classifiers. Heatmaps maps were used to identify the performance determining image regions. The CNNs performed with an Area-Under-the-Curve of 0.95 (status balanced) and 0.86 (location balanced, masked), compared to an AUC of 0.81 of experienced radiologists. Interestingly, CNNs used anatomical surroundings to increase their performance, \"learning\" the infiltration probabilities of anatomical locations. In conclusion, CNNs have the potential to build a well performing CT-based biomarker for lymph node metastases in PCa, with different types of class balancing strongly affecting CNN performance."

The probability of death risk was then stratified.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      One thousand and three hundred and seventy-nine (54.33%) patients died. The random forest (RF) model was overall the best in terms of predictive performance, with the AUC of 0.844 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.826-0.862) in the development cohort and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.754-0.818) in the validation cohort for predicting mortality. Twelve baseline variables contributing to mortality prediction in the RF model were C-reactive protein, PD-L1 level, cancer type, prior liver metastasis, derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, hemoglobin, white blood cell count, number of metastatic sites, pulse rate, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. A total of 1782 (70.2%) patients were separated into the high-risk and 756 (29.8%) low-risk groups. Patients in the high-risk group were significantly more likely to die, experience disease progression, discontinue study, and discontinue treatment than patients in the low-risk group (all p values < 0.001). Risk groups were not associated with immune-related adverse events and grades 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (all p values > 0.05).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      RF model has good performance in mortality prediction and risk stratification for cancer patients receiving atezolizumab monotherapy."

Incidence rate ratios (IRR) by sex, age, and histology were computed according to tertiles of residential exposure to benzene, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particular matter, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) among 1076 incident cases of lung and 650 cases of bladder cancers. In men of all ages and in women under 75 years of age, no significant associations were observed. Conversely, in women aged ≥75 years significantly increased risks of lung and bladder cancers were related to high exposure to benzene (IRR for highest vs. lowest tertile: 2.00 for lung cancer and 1.94 for bladder cancer) and NO2 (IRR: 1.72 for lung cancer; and 1.94 for bladder cancer).

Patients with BCG-unresponsive high-grade Ta/T1 papillary NMIBC also received NAI plus BCG (cohort B). The primary end point was the incidence of CR at the 3- or 6-month assessment visit for cohorts A and C, and the disease-free survival (DFS) rate at 12 months for cohort B. Durability, cystectomy avoidance, progression-free survival, disease-specific survival (DSS), and overall survival were secondary end points for cohort A. RESULTS: In cohort A, CR was achieved in 58 (71%) of 82 patients (95% confidence interval [CI]=59.6 to 80.3; median follow-up, 23.9 months), with a median duration of 26.6 months (95% CI=9.9 months to [upper bound not reached]). At 24 months in patients with CR, the Kaplan–Meier estimated probability of avoiding cystectomy and of DSS was 89.2% and 100%, respectively. In cohort B (n=72), the Kaplan–Meier estimated DFS rate was 55.4% (95% CI=42.0% to 66.8%) at 12 months, with median DFS of 19.3 months (95% CI=7.4 months to [upper bound not reached]). Most treatment-emergent adverse events for patients receiving BCG plus NAI were grade 1 to 2 (86%); three grade 3 immune-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BCG-unresponsive bladder carcinoma in situ and papillary NMIBC treated with BCG and the novel agent NAI, CRs were achieved with a persistence of effect, cystectomy avoidance, and 100% bladder cancer–specific survival at 24 months. The study is ongoing, with an estimated target enrollment of 200 participants (Funded by ImmunityBio.)"

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Previous research has identified an association between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and lung cancer. Most of the evidence for this association, however, is based on research using lung cancer mortality, not incidence. Research that examines potential associations between PM2.5 and incidence of non-lung cancers is limited.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the incidence of cancer and exposure to PM2.5 using >8.5 million cases of cancer incidences from U.S. registries. Secondary objectives include evaluating the sensitivity of the associations to model selection, spatial control, and latency period as well as estimating the exposure-response relationship for several cancer types.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data were used to calculate incidence rates for various cancer types in 607 U.S. counties. County-level PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using integrated empirical geographic regression models. Flexible semi-nonparametric regression models were used to estimate associations between PM2.5 and cancer incidence for selected cancers while controlling for important county-level covariates. Primary time-independent models using average incidence rates from 1992-2016 and average PM2.5 from 1988-2015 were estimated. In addition, time-varying models using annual incidence rates from 2002-2011 and lagged moving averages of annual estimates for PM2.5 were also estimated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The incidences of all cancer and lung cancer were consistently associated with PM2.5. The incident rate ratios (IRRs), per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, for all and lung cancer were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.14) and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.30), respectively. Less robust associations were observed with oral, rectal, liver, skin, breast, and kidney cancers.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      Exposure to PM2.5 air pollution contributes to lung cancer incidence and is potentially associated with non-lung cancer incidence. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7246."

The dataset contained 2411 unique tumors encompassing non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive BLCA (MIBC).

Subtype Neural-like (median OS, 87 mo) is prevalent in MIBC and characterized by high WNT/β-catenin signaling. HER2-like (107.7 mo) is distributed evenly across NMIBC and MIBC, with higher ERBB2 amplification and signaling. Papillary-like (>135 mo), an NMIBC subtype enriched in urothelial differentiation genes, shows a high frequency of actionable FGFR3 mutations, amplifications, and FGFR3-TACC3 fusion. Luminal-like (91.7 mo), predominantly NMIBC, has higher MAPK signaling and more KRAS and KMT2C/D mutations than other subtypes. Mesenchymal-like (MES; 86.6 mo) and Squamous-cell carcinoma-like (SCC; 20.6 mo) are predominant in MIBC. MES is high in AXL signaling, whereas SCC has elevated PD1, CTLA4 signaling, and macrophage M2 infiltration. About 20% of NMIBCs show MIBC subtype traits and a lower 5-yr OS rate than Papillary-like NMIBC (81% vs 96%). The main limitations of our study are the incomplete clinical annotation, and the analyses were based on transcriptome subset due to comparisons across gene expression quantification technologies.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      BLCA can be stratified into six molecular subtypes. NMIBC, with a high risk of progression, displays the molecular features of MIBC.\n    \n\n\n          Patient summary:\n        \n      \n      Biomarkers are urgently needed to guide patient treatment selection and avoid unnecessary toxicities in those who fail to respond. We believe molecular subtyping is a promising way to tailor disease management for those who will benefit most."

            "abstract": "Collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) is a rare subset of high-grade renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To diagnose CDC, it is necessary to rule out other renal tumors including renal medullary carcinoma and fumarate hydratase (FH)-deficient RCC. However, there is overlap in the morphology of these three tumors, which all have poor outcomes. There is also still a need to sufficiently examine the therapeutic strategies for each of these tumors. In this study, we retrospectively reclassified invasive/infiltrating high-grade RCC and investigated its pathological features. We reviewed 18 cases previously diagnosed as \"CDC,\" \"FH-deficient RCC,\" and \"unclassified RCC,\" which were reclassified as SMARCB1/INI1-deficient RCC, FH-deficient RCC, and CDC by SMARCB1/INI1, FH, and 2SC immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FH gene mutational status. As the result, 18 cases were reclassified into 2 cases of SMARCB1/INI1-deficient RCC, 7 cases of FH-deficient RCC, and 9 cases of CDC. The morphological features of each group overlapped, and no specific immunohistochemical expression except for SMARCB1/INI1, FH, and 2SC was detected. These results suggest that invasive/infiltrating high-grade RCC should be diagnosed by the combination of immunohistochemistry and molecular biological technique."

            "abstract": "Context:\n        \n      \n      Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treatment is an evolving challenge. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted endoradiotherapy/radioligand therapy (PRLT) with small-molecule, urea-based agents labeled with the β-particle-emitting radionuclide lutetium-177 (177Lu) is a promising new approach.\n    \n\n\n          Objective:\n        \n      \n      In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of PRLT.\n    \n\n\n          Evidence acquisition:\n        \n      \n      A systematic search was performed in PubMed/Medline (last updated February 18, 2019). A total of 250 studies were reviewed, and 24 studies with 1192 patients were included in the analysis. Proportions of patients with ≥50% serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decrease, any PSA decrease, and any PSA increase were extracted. Proportions of patients showing any grade toxicity and those with grade 3/4 toxicities based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading were extracted from manuscripts. Overall survival and progression-free survival were evaluated. A meta-analysis of single proportions was carried out. Furthermore, we compared the two most common PRLT agents, 177Lu-PSMA with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T, for effectiveness and toxicity.\n    \n\n\n          Evidence synthesis:\n        \n      \n      Among the 24 included studies, 20 included data on 177Lu-PSMA-617, three included data on 177Lu-PSMA-I&T, and one study had aggregated data for 177Lu-PSMA-617 and 177Lu-PSMA-I&T. The estimated proportion of 177Lu-PSMA-617-treated patients who showed a serum PSA decrease of ≥50% with at least an 8-wk interval between therapy and PSA measurement was 0.44 (0.39; 0.50). Therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T demonstrated an estimated proportion of patients with ≥50% PSA reduction to be 0.36 (0.26; 0.47). The aggregate results for men treated with more than one cycle of any kind of PRLT showed an estimated proportion of 0.46 (0.41; 0.51) for PSA response ≥50%. Regarding aggregate data from all of the PRLT agents, we found that grade 3 and 4 toxicities were uncommon, with estimated proportions from 0.01 (0.00;0.04) for nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and elevated aspartate transaminase up to 0.08 (0.05; 0.12) for anemia. There was considerable heterogeneity among the studies in the \"any-grade toxicity\" groups. Meta-regression showed that more than one cycle of PRLT is associated with a greater proportion of patients with ≥50% PSA reduction. Overall survival according to pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for any PSA decline was 0.29 (0.18; 0.46), and for >50% PSA reduction was 0.67 (0.43; 1.07). Progression-free survival according to a pooled HR of >50% PSA reduction was 0.53 (0.32; 0.86).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The relatively high number of PSA responders alongside the low rate of severe toxicity reflects the potentially promising role of PRLT in treating CRPC. The ultimate utility of this treatment modality will become clearer as multiple prospective studies continue to accrue. In the interim, this systematic review and meta-analysis can serve as a compendium of effectiveness and adverse events associated with PRLT for treating clinicians.\n    \n\n\n          Patient summary:\n        \n      \n      Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted endoradiotherapy/radioligand therapy (PRLT) is associated with ≥50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen level in a large number of patients and a low rate of toxicity, reflecting its potential in treating castration-resistant prostate cancer. This systematic review and meta-analysis presents as a compendium of the effectiveness and adverse events related to PRLT for treating clinicians."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Ultra-hypofractionated regimens for definitive prostate cancer (PCa) radiotherapy are increasingly utilized due in part to promising safety and efficacy data complemented by greater patient convenience from a treatment course requiring fewer sessions. As such, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is rapidly emerging as a standard definitive treatment option for patients with localized PCa. The commercially available magnetic resonance linear accelerator (MR-LINAC) integrates MR imaging with radiation delivery, providing several theoretical advantages compared to computed tomography (CT)-guided radiotherapy. MR-LINAC technology facilitates improved visualization of the prostate, real-time intrafraction tracking of prostate and organs-at-risk (OAR), and online adaptive planning to account for target movement and anatomical changes. These features enable reduced treatment volume margins and improved sparing of surrounding OAR. The theoretical advantages of MR-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) have recently been shown to significantly reduce rates of acute grade ≥ 2 GU toxicities as reported in the prospective randomized phase III MIRAGE trial, which compared MR-LINAC vs CT-based 5 fraction SBRT in patients with localized PCa (Kishan et al. JAMA Oncol 9:365-373, 2023). Thus, MR-LINAC SBRT-utilizing potentially fewer treatments-is warranted and clinically relevant for men with low or intermediate risk PCa electing for radiotherapy as definitive treatment.\n    \n\n\n          Methods/design:\n        \n      \n      A total of 136 men with treatment naïve low or intermediate risk PCa will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 5 or 2 fractions of MR-guided SBRT using permuted block randomization. Randomization is stratified by baseline Expanded PCa Index Composite (EPIC) bowel and urinary domain scores. Patients undergoing 5 fractions will receive 37.5 Gy to the prostate over 10-14 days and patients undergoing 2 fractions will receive 25 Gy to the prostate over 7-10 days. The co-primary endpoints are GI and GU toxicities as measured by change scores in the bowel and urinary EPIC domains, respectively. The change scores will be calculated as pre-treatment (baseline) score subtracted from the 2-year score.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      FORT is an international, multi-institutional prospective randomized phase II trial evaluating whether MR-guided SBRT delivered in 2 fractions versus 5 fractions is non-inferior from a gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity standpoint at 2 years post-treatment in men with low or intermediate risk PCa.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04984343 .
