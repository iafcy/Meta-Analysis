Nonetheless, several of the associations remain controversial. Moreover, our understanding of the possible interaction between the local environment and the genetic variability is still very limited.\n## OBJECTIVE\nThe aim of this study was to clarify the role of the local environment and its possible interplay with genetics on common cancers development.\n## METHODS\nUsing the UK Biobank (UKBB) prospective cohort, we selected 12 local environment exposures: nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxides, particulate matter (10 and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm), noise pollution, urban traffic, living distance from the coast, percentage of greenspace, natural environment, water, and domestic garden within 1000\u00a0m from the residential coordinates of each participant. All these exposures were tested for association with 17 different types of cancer for a total of 53,270 cases and 302,645 controls. Additionally, a polygenic score (PGS) was computed for each cancer, to test possible gene-environment interactions. Finally, mediation analyses were carried out.\n## RESULTS\nThirty-six statistically significant associations considering multiple testing (p\u00a0<\u00a02.19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\n## DISCUSSION\nLiving close to the coast and air pollution were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer and skin melanoma, respectively. These findings from the UKBB support the role of the local environment on cancer development, which is independent from genetics and may be mediated by several lifestyle factors.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nLong-term exposure to fine particles \u22642.5 \u03bcm in diameter (PM2.5) has been linked to cancer mortality. However, the effect of wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure on cancer mortality risk is unknown. This study evaluates the association between wildfire-related PM2.5 and site-specific cancer mortality in Brazil, from 2010 to 2016.\n## METHODS AND FINDINGS\nNationwide cancer death records were collected during 2010-2016 from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Death records were linked with municipal-level wildfire- and non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentrations, at a resolution of 2.0\u00b0 latitude by 2.5\u00b0 longitude. We applied a variant difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, adjusting for seasonal temperature and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the exposure for specific cancer sites were estimated. Attributable fractions and cancer deaths were also calculated. In total, 1,332,526 adult cancer deaths (age \u2265 20 years), from 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, covering 136 million adults were included. The mean annual wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 2.38 \u03bcg/m3, and the annual non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 8.20 \u03bcg/m3. The RR for mortality from all cancers was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001) per 1-\u03bcg/m3 increase of wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration, which was higher than the RR per 1-\u03bcg/m3 increase of non-wildfire-related PM2.5 (1.01 [95% CI 1.00-1.01], p = 0.007, with p for difference = 0.003). Wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with mortality from cancers of the nasopharynx (1.10 [95% CI 1.04-1.16], p = 0.002), esophagus (1.05 [95% CI 1.01-1.08], p = 0.012), stomach (1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.017), colon/rectum (1.08 [95% CI 1.05-1.11], p < 0.001), larynx (1.06 [95% CI 1.02-1.11], p = 0.003), skin (1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.12], p = 0.003), breast (1.04 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.007), prostate (1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.019), and testis (1.10 [95% CI 1.03-1.17], p = 0.002). For all cancers combined, the attributable deaths were 37 per 100,000 population and ranged from 18/100,000 in the Northeast Region of Brazil to 71/100,000 in the Central-West Region. Study limitations included a potential lack of assessment of the joint effects of gaseous pollutants, an inability to capture the migration of residents, and an inability to adjust for some potential confounders.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nExposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 can increase the risks of cancer mortality for many cancer sites, and the effect for wildfire-related PM2.5 was higher than for PM2.5 from non-wildfire sources.\n",

            "abstract": "Long-term exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to lung cancer incidence and mortality, but limited evidence existed for other cancers. This study aimed to assess the association between PM2.5 on cancer specific mortality. An ecological study based on the cancer mortality data collected from 5,565 Brazilian cities during 2010-2018 using a difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, was applied to examine PM2.5-cancer mortality associations. Globally gridded annual average surface PM2.5 concentration was extracted and linked with the residential municipality of participants in this study. Sex, age stratified and exposure-response estimations were also conducted. Totalling 1,768,668 adult cancer deaths records of about 208 million population living across 5,565 municipalities were included in this study. The average PM2.5 concentration was 7.63 \u03bcg/m3 (standard deviation 3.32) with range from 2.95 \u03bcg/m3 to 28.5 \u03bcg/m3. With each 10 \u03bcg/m3 increase in three-year-average (current year and previous two years) concentrations of PM2.5, the relative risks (RR) of cancer mortality were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.20) for all-site cancers. The PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with several cancer-specific mortalities including oral, nasopharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, colon rectum, liver, gallbladder, larynx, lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix, prostate, brain and leukaemia. No safe level of PM2.5 exposure was observed in the exposure-response curve for all types of cancer. In conclusion, with nationwide cancer death records in Brazil, we found that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increased risks of mortality for many cancer types. Even low level PM2.5 concentrations had significant impacts on cancer mortality.",

We aimed to examine associations of 10-year exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers.\n## Methods:\nFor each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort among the national Medicare beneficiaries during 2000 to 2016. We simultaneously examined the additive associations of six exposures, namely, moving average exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 over the year of diagnosis and previous 2 years, previous 3 to 5 years, and previous 6 to 10 years, with the risk of first cancer diagnosis after 10 years of follow-up, during which there was no cancer diagnosis.\n## Results:\nThe cohorts included 2.2 to 6.5 million subjects for different cancers. Exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2 was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, while the association for PM2.5 remained inconclusive. At exposure levels below the newly updated World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline, we observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the risks of all cancers, which were translated to hundreds to thousands new cancer cases per year within the cohort per unit increase in each exposure.\n## Conclusions:\nThese findings suggested substantial cancer burden was associated with exposures to PM2.5 and NO2, emphasizing the urgent need for strategies to mitigate air pollution levels.",

Here, we investigate the use of a transportation model developed during the summer season to generate a measure of traffic emissions as an alternative to the LUR model. Our traffic model provides estimates of emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the level of individual roads, as does the LUR model. Our main objective was to compare the distribution of the spatial estimates of NOx computed from our transportation model to the distribution obtained from the LUR model. A secondary objective was to compare estimates of risk using these two exposure estimates. We observed that the correlation (spearman) between our two measures of exposure (NO2 and NOx) ranged from less than 0.3 to more than 0.9 across Montreal neighborhoods. The most important factor affecting the \"agreement\" between the two measures in a specific area was found to be the length of roads. Areas affected by a high level of traffic-related air pollution had a far better agreement between the two exposure measures. A comparison of odds ratios (ORs) obtained from NO2 and NOx used in two case-control studies of breast and prostate cancer, showed that the differences between the ORs associated with NO2 exposure vs NOx exposure differed by 5.2-8.8%.\n",

Recently, air pollution dispersion has been used to derive NO2 exposures in urban areas. There is evidence that data collection protocols and modelling assumptions can have a large effect on the resulting NO2 spatial distribution. This study investigates the effects of various NO2 surfaces on the risk estimates of postmenopausal breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC), both of which have already been associated with traffic-related air pollution. We derived exposures for individuals in two case control studies in Montreal, Canada using four different surfaces for NO2. Two of the surfaces were developed using LUR but employed different data collection protocols (LUR-1 and LUR-2), and the other two surfaces were generated using dispersion modelling; one with a regional model (dispersion-1) and another with a street canyon model (dispersion-2). Also, we estimated separate odds ratios (ORs) using concentrations of NO2 as measures of exposure for both cancers. While the range of NO2 concentrations from dispersion (4\u201326 ppb) was lower than the range from LUR (4\u201336 ppb), the four surfaces were found to be moderately correlated, with Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from 0.76 to 0.88. The ORs for BC were estimated to be 1.26, 1.10, 1.07, and 1.05 based on LUR-1, LUR-2, dispersion-1, and dispersion-2. In contrast, the ORs for PC were estimated to be 1.39, 1.30, 1.13, and 1.04 based on LUR-1, LUR-2, dispersion-1, and dispersion-2. The four exposure measures indicated positive associations but we observed higher mean ORs based on the LUR surfaces albeit with overlapping CIs. Since LUR models capture all sources of NO2 and dispersion models only capture traffic emissions, it is possible that this difference is due to the fact that non-road sources also contribute to the spatial distribution in NO2 concentrations.",
