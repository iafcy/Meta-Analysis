cancer according to the International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revision codes 189.0 and C64. We
applied Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders at the individual and area-level.
RESULTS: The participants were followed from baseline (1985–2005) to 2011–2015. A total of 847 cases
occurred during 5,497,514 person-years of follow-up (average 18.2 years). Median (5–95%) exposure levels of
NO2, PM2.5, BC and O3 were 24.1 μg/m3 (12.8–39.2), 15.3 μg/m3 (8.6–19.2), 1.6 10(cid:0)5 m(cid:0)1 (0.7–2.1), and 87.0
μg/m3 (70.3–97.4), respectively. The results of the fully adjusted linear analyses showed a hazard ratio (HR) of
1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92, 1.15) per 10 μg/m3 NO2, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.21) per 5 μg/m3 PM2.5,
0.99 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.11) per 0.5 10(cid:0)5 m(cid:0)1 BCE, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.02) per 10 μg/m3 O3. We did not find
associations between any of the elemental components of PM2.5 and cancer of the kidney parenchyma.
CONCLUSION: We did not observe an association between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and incidence
of kidney parenchyma cancer.
