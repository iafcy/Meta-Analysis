1. Introduction
Urinary bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most common
cancer worldwide [1]. Smoking is the primary risk factor for
BC, with relative risks of three for current smokers and two
for former smokers compared to individuals who never
smoked [2]. Findings from the most recent studies suggest
that the relative risk for current smokers has increased to
four or five times the risk for nonsmokers [3]. The relative
risk for BC increases with smoking duration and intensity
[4]. BC occurs mainly in older people, is more frequent in
men, and exhibits large geographical variation [5].
Ambient air pollution includes a mix of carcinogens such
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), volatile
organic compounds, transition metals, and diesel engine
exhaust [6,7]. Ambient air pollution and particulate matter
(PM) in ambient air have recently been classified as
carcinogenic to humans [6]. This classification was largely
based on higher risk of lung cancer [8–10]. However, there is
suggestive evidence of an association between ambient air
pollution and BC in humans [6,10].
Higher BC risk has been reported in some studies on taxi,
bus, and/or truck drivers exposed to high levels of urban air
pollution [6], including PAHs [11] and diesel engine exhaust
[7], but no risk elevation was found for miners with
high diesel exposure [12]. Some of these studies
incidence-based,
were
while others were based on mortality,
which may also have contributed to the heterogeneity
observed for results. A few studies have investigated a
possible association between exposure to ambient air
pollution and BC in the general population, and provided
mixed results [13–17]. Limitations related to design, poor
exposure assessment, and lack of information on potential
confounding complicate interpretation of these previous
studies.
Our aim was to examine the associations between
exposure to ambient air pollution at the place of residence
and BC incidence in a large European study population with
fine-scale exposure assessment and extensive control for
potential confounders such as smoking. We used the same
study population, exposure assessment, and data analysis
methods as in our previous study documenting significant
associations between air pollution and lung cancer [9]
2. Materials and methods

The European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) project
included 36 European areas where air pollution measurements were
performed, exposure models were developed, and cohort studies located

Abstract
Background:
cancer
Environment
Prevention
Ambient air pollution contains low concentrations of carcinogens impli-
cated in the etiology of urinary bladder cancer (BC). Little is known about whether
exposure to air pollution influences BC in the general population.
Objective: To evaluate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air
pollution and BC incidence.
Design, setting, and participants: We obtained data from 15 population-based cohorts
enrolled between 1985 and 2005 in eight European countries (N = 303 431; mean
follow-up 14.1 yr). We estimated exposure to nitrogen oxides (NO and
2
NO ),
x
particulate
matter (PM) with diameter <10 mm (PM ), 10 <2.5 mm (PM ), 2.5 between 2.5 and 10 mm
(PM ),

PM
2.5
(soot),
absorbance
elemental constituents of PM, organic carbon, and
traffic density at baseline home addresses using standardized land-use regression
models from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects project.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We used Cox proportional-hazards
models with adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and
meta-analyses to estimate summary hazard ratios (HRs) for BC incidence.
Results and limitations: During follow-up, 943 incident BC cases were diagnosed. In the
meta-analysis, none of the exposures were associated with BC risk. The summary HRs
associated with a 10-mg/m3increase in NO and
2
5-mg/m3increase in PM were
2.5
0.98
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89–1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.63–1.18), respectively.
Limitations include the lack of information about lifetime exposure.
Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between exposure to outdoor air
pollution levels at place of residence and risk of BC.
Patient summary: We assessed the link between outdoor air pollution at place of
residence and bladder cancer using the largest study population to date and extensive
assessment of exposure and comprehensive data on personal risk factors such as
smoking. We found no association between the levels of outdoor air pollution at place
of residence and bladder cancer risk.

cohorts with information on incident BC cases with at least 20 incident
BC cases during follow-up and where the resources needed for
participation were available. The cohorts were in Sweden (European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition[EPIC]-Umea, Swed-
ish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen [SNAC-K],
Stockholm Screening Across the Lifespan Twin Study and TwinGene
[SALT], Stockholm 60 years old and IMPROVE study [Sixty], Stockholm
Diabetes Prevention Program [SDPP]), Norway (Oslo Health Study
[HUBRO]), Denmark (Diet, Cancer and Health Study [DCH]), the
Netherlands (EPIC Monitoring Project on Risk Factors and Chronic
Diseases in the Netherlands [MORGEN], EPIC PROSPECT), the UK (EPIC
Oxford), Austria (Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Prevention Pro-
gramme [VHM&PP]), Italy (EPIC Varese, EPIC Turin, Italian Studies of
Respiratory Disorders in Childhood and Environment–Rome [SIDRIA]
Rome), and Spain (EPIC San Sebastian). Figure 1 shows the study areas
and Supplementary Table 1 lists the population characteristics. A pooled
analysis of all cohort data was not possible owing to data-transfer and
privacy issues, but data from the four Stockholm cohorts (SNAC-K, SALT,
Sixty, and SALT) were pooled, analyzed, and denoted as one
(Cardiovascular
cohort
Effects of Air pollution and Noise in Stockholm [CEANS]).
Similarly, data from the two cohorts from the Netherlands (EPIC
MORGEN and EPIC PROSPECT) were pooled, analyzed, and denoted as
one cohort [EPIC NL] (Supplementary Table 2). Most of the participants
were recruited in the 1990s (Table 1). Participants with a cancer (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer) before enrolment were excluded, as were
participants for whom information about exposure to air pollution and
the most important potential confounders could not be obtained. We
included 303 431 participants (81.7% of those enrolled).
Each cohort study followed the rules for ethics and data protection in
the country in which it was based. All participants gave informed
consent.
2.2. Bladder cancer
In all cohorts, follow-up was based on linkage to cancer registries, with
the exception of SIDRIA–Rome, for which hospital discharge and
mortality register data were used. Cases were defined as participants
diagnosed with BC recoded according to ICD-9 code 1880-1889 and ICD-
10 code C67. We did not include carcinomas in situ. Only primary
cancers (ie, not metastases) and only malignant tumors were included.
2.3. Exposure assessment
Annual average air pollution concentrations at residential addresses at
the time of enrolment in the cohort studies were estimated via area-
specific land-use regression (LUR) models using standardized methods
developed within ESCAPE [19,20].
Air pollution was measured for 1 yr in each study area between
October 2008 and May 2011. PM with a diameter of <10 mm (PM ),
10
PM ,
2.5
and soot/blackness of the PM -exposed
2.5
filter (PM
2.5
),
absorbance
determined via measurement of light reflectance, were measured at
20 sites. Nitrogen dioxide (NO )
2
and nitrogen oxides (NO)
x
were
measured at 40 sites in each of the areas. Sites were selected to represent
spatial variations in air pollution in the residential areas. Within each
study area, measurements at each site were performed during three
2-wk periods (during summer, winter, and an intermediate season) and
the three measurements were averaged, adjusting for temporal trends
using continuous data from a reference site [9] to estimate the annual
mean at each site. For financial reasons, sampling of PM was not
performed everywhere (Fig. 1).
LUR models were then developed for each pollutant in each study
area, with the yearly mean concentration as the dependent variable

an extensive list of geographic attributes as possible predictors. Data
from the nearest routine monitoring stations were used to back-
extrapolate the LUR estimates to the baseline year in 14 of the 15 study
areas using the ratio method [21].
We also collected information on traffic intensity (vehicles/d) on the
nearest street for all cohorts except for two (Fig. 1, Table 2).
We used the same methods to assess concentrations of eight PM
elements [22] and organic carbon in PM [23] to facilitate explorative
analyses of associations with BC risk.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used for the cohort-specific
analyses in accordance with a standardized protocol [9]. Age was used as
the time scale. Follow-up started at enrollment in the cohort. Censoring
was at the time of death or emigration, a diagnosis of any other cancer
(except non-melanoma skin cancer), or the end of follow-up, whichever
came first.
Exposure was analyzed as a linear variable. Potential confounders
were available from questionnaires at baseline (Supplementary Table 1).
We specified a priori three confounder models with increasing levels of
adjustment for both individual and contextual socioeconomic status
(SES) variables, following the methodology of our previous study on lung
cancer [9]. Model 1 included only age (time axis), sex, and calendar time
(year of enrollment, continuous). Model 2 added the following
individual-level variables (as available for the individual cohorts; all
referring to baseline): smoking status (never/former/current), smoking
intensity (tobacco g/d, linear and squared term), smoking duration
(years), occupational class (ever worked in an industry/job associated
with higher BC risk or white/blue collar classification), employment
status, and educational level (low, medium, high). Model 3 added area-
level SES variables, including mean income, percentage of people with a
low income, unemployment rate, and educational level or deprivation
index, which were defined for most of the cohorts at the neighborhood or
municipality level. Model 3 was selected as the main confounder model.
Detailed information on jobs associated with high BC risk was only
available for DCH, while three cohorts had less detailed information on
occupation and nine cohorts had information on employment status.
We performed the following model checks and sensitivity analyses.
First, we tested the linearity assumption in the relation between each
exposure and BC by replacing the linear term with a natural cubic spline
with two equally spaced inner knots, and compared the model fit of the
linear and spline models using a likelihood ratio test. Second, we
assessed whether there was a deviation from the proportional hazards
assumption in the Cox model. Third, we assessed potential effect
modification by sex, smoking status, and level of education. Fourth,
restricted
we
analyses to participants who had lived at the baseline address
throughout follow-up to minimize misclassification of long-term
exposure relevant to the development of BC. Fifth, we fitted back-
extrapolated exposure to take into account long-term trends in air
pollution. Finally, we added an indicator of extent of urbanization to the
most comprehensively adjusted model.
Cohort-specific effect estimates were combined by random-effects
meta-analysis for each exposure when it was available in at least three
cohorts [24]. The I2statistic and Q test were used to assess heterogeneity
among cohort-specific effect estimates [25].
Stata software, version 11 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) was
used for all data analyses.
3. Results
3.1. Study population
In total, the 15 cohorts contributed 4,275 936 person-years
at risk, and 943 incident BC cases developed during mean
follow-up of 14.1 yr (range 0.0–27.0; Table 1). The mean age
at baseline was 48 yr, ranging from 43 to 57 yr across
cohorts. Some 39% of the participants were men, 21% were
current smokers, and 18% were former smokers (Table 1).
The study areas exhibited a wide range of air pollution
concentrations between and within each cohort. The
modeled mean air pollution concentrations were lowest
in the Swedish and highest in the Italian study areas
(Table 2, Supplementary Table 3).
3.2. Air pollution, traffic density, and BC
In the meta-analysis, none of the exposures were signifi-
cantly associated with BC incidence (Table 3, Fig. 2). All
exposures investigated, including PM elements (Supple-
mentary Table 4), were associated with HRs close to null.
The summary HRs in model 3 associated with a 10-mg/m3
increase in NO and
2
5-mg/m3 increase in PM were
2.5
0.98
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89–1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI
0.63–1.18), respectively.
For all exposures, the summary HRs were essentially
HR = 1 in models adjusted for age, sex, and calendar year
only. The HRs were slightly reduced in models with
comprehensive adjustment (Table
Table
3).

The meta-analyses showed significant heterogeneity
between cohorts for PM ,
10
PM ,
2.5–10
and a few elemental
components of PM, while no substantial heterogeneity was
observed for most of the exposures assessed (Table 3, Fig. 2,
Supplementary Table 4).
3.3. Model checks, sensitivity analysis, and effect modification
In most cohorts, there was no evidence of deviation from
linearity for any of the pollutants (Supplementary
Tables 5 and 6). All cohorts met the proportional hazards
assumptions for Cox models (Supplementary Table 7).
Higher risk of BC among men was suggested for NO ,
2
but the effect modification by sex was
statistically
borderline
significant and not evident for PM ,
2.5
and
there was no effect modification by smoking habit and
education for any of the pollutants (Supplementary
Table 8). Results reported in Table 3 were similar to
those in a sensitivity analysis restricted to non-movers,
models fitted with back-extrapolated exposure to NO
2
and models additionally adjusted for degree of urbaniza-
tion (Supplementary Table 9).
4. Discussion
In this prospective study of 15 European cohorts, long-term
exposure to ambient air pollution was not associated with
risk of

Our study is the largest study with detailed individual-
level confounder variables to date on the relationship
between ambient air pollution and BC in the general
population. The lack of an association between air pollution
and NO ,
x
traffic density, PAHs, and BC risk observed in our
study is consistent with some previous studies from
Denmark, Spain, and the Netherlands [13,14,16] and
inconsistent with others from Spain and Taiwan [14,15]. In-
consistency among studies may be partly explained by
differences in design, exposure assessment, and ability to
adjust for smoking. Only two of the five previous studies
adjusted for smoking [13,14]. Three case-control studies
reported higher BC risk in association with crude indicators
of exposure to outdoor air pollution such as residence in an
urban area (22–46% [17], 4–63% [14]) and in municipalities
characterized by high air pollution exposure (36–188%
[15]). However, residential exposure to specific air pollu-
tants was not assessed at fine-scale individual levels in four
of the five previous studies [14–17], the results were not
consistent within these studies, and nonsignificant results
for other indicators such as residential proximity to PAH
emissions or diesel engine exhaust from industries [14] and
urban residence [15] were reported too. The previous
studies relying on crude area-specific indicators [14,15,17]
may have captured differences related to area of living,
rather than fine-scale, individual-level differences in air
pollution.
Similar to tobacco smoke, it is evident that ambient air
pollution can induce DNA damage in the general population
[6]. Several studies have linked exposure to ambient air
pollution to biomarkers of exposure to genotoxic carcino-
gens and cancer-related early-effect biomarkers, such as
bulky DNA adducts, chromosome aberrations, micronuclei,
and DNA methylation [6,26]. Accordingly, carcinogenic
genotoxic effects may be induced in the urinary bladder by
exposure to ambient air pollution with particles, providing
biological plausibility of an association between ambient air
pollution and BC.
A major strength of our study is that it relies on 8-yr to
18-yr mean follow-up for large European population-based
cohorts spread over a wide geographic area with very
different air pollution levels, which adds to the generaliz-
ability of the results. Another important strength is the
state-of-the-art assessment of quantitative exposure to key
air pollutants instead of crude indicators of exposure. We
used a standardized extensive exposure assessment that
enabled us to assess fine-scale, address-specific, spatial
variation in concentrations of a more comprehensive
number of air pollutants than in previous studies. In
contrast to any prior studies, we were able to assess PM ,

absorbance
and components of PM. Only
a case-control study from Taiwan previously evaluated
exposure to PM [15],
10
but this study relied on routine air
pollution monitoring stations, which do not adequately
capture within-city exposure variability. Assessment of PM
is important because PM is considered to be the most
relevant airborne pollutant for carcinogenesis [8,10]. In-
deed, our previous analysis showed that higher HRs for lung
cancer were associated with long-term exposure to PM,
not
but
NO and
2
NO [9].
x
Furthermore, detailed information
about individual baseline characteristics such as smoking
habits were available for adjustment. Three of the previous
five studies [15–17] could not control for smoking.
Our study has some limitations. The LUR models were
developed based on measurements and data from 2008 to
2011, whereas they were applied to baseline home
addresses typically 10–15 yr earlier (Table 1). To address
this discrepancy, we back-extrapolated exposure to the
baseline period using long-term routine monitoring data,
which were available for all cohorts except HUBRO, which
contributed only 2% of the cases. In our study, the meta-
analysis HRs were not sensitive to back-extrapolation for
NO .
2
This approach relied on the assumption that the spatial
distribution of the determinants of air pollution (eg, traffic,
land use, and household density) had not changed
substantially. We believe that the correlations between
air pollution levels at the baseline residence and concen-
trations in earlier periods would be high, as it has been
shown that spatial comparisons of NO are
2
stable over time
[27,28], but we could not back-extrapolate all exposures
and we recognize the potential for exposure misclassifica-
tion. Furthermore, exposure at the baseline address does
not necessarily cover the entire exposure time window of
relevance for BC development, which seems to range from a
few years [2] to many decades [13,29] before diagnosis, and
we might have overlooked an association between exposure
many decades ago and BC risk. Restriction of the study
population to those who lived at the baseline address
throughout follow-up provided similar null results (Sup-
plementary Table 9). The lack of information on exposure
before baseline and elsewhere (eg, at work and during
transport) is a potential source of exposure misclassification
that may have biased our results towards the null
hypothesis. We have previously reported an association
between ambient air pollution and lung cancer using the
same methodology [9], which supports the notion that this
method does capture exposures relevant for cancer
development. However, we cannot rule out that an
inadequate follow-up period coupled with some unavoid-
able misclassification of exposure could have masked any
low-level BC risk associated with ambient air pollution
exposure in the general population. It is not possible in this
study to estimate latency, since exposure, which would
have begun before baseline, was not estimated in our study.
Nevertheless, subjects in our study were all aged >40 yr at
baseline, and thus would have been exposed to air pollution
for an adequate period of time to demonstrate a higher risk.
Furthermore, we did find that active smoking recorded at
baseline in all cohorts was associated with higher BC risk
(adjusted HR ranging from 1.01 to 1.20 per g/d), which
suggests that there was adequate follow-up time for these
cohorts.
If our study participants had been older at baseline or
had been followed for a longer time, more BC cases could be
included to increase the precision of the risk estimates.
Nonetheless, our study included 941 BC cases and provided
results with very narrow confidence intervals. We adjusted
the analyses for a number of potential confounding
E
factors.

The small change in HR after adjustment was mainly due to
smoking. The potential for residual confounding by smoking
seems limited, since adjustment only affected HRs moder-
ately and because similar null results were observed among
never-smokers (Supplementary Table 8). Information on
education was not available for the Austrian cohort, which
contributed a third of the cases in our study. However, for all
the other cohorts, the HRs associated with PM and
2.5
NO
2
exposure were similar with and without adjustment for
education. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this may have
caused substantial bias.
Furthermore, we did not assess effect modification by
age at diagnosis and stage of disease, so we cannot exclude
the possibility that the null effect of air pollution was
impacted by age and/or restriction of the cases series to
non–muscle-invasive BC. Finally, we cannot exclude con-
founding from potential risk factors for BC that were
unaccounted for, such as disinfection by-products [30] or
arsenic [31] in drinking water. Future studies should
consider evaluation of polycyclic aromatic amines, which
was not possible in our study.
5. Conclusions
In conclusion, this large prospective study does not provide
evidence of an association between ambient air pollution at
place of residence and BC incidence.
