interaction between green space and PM2.5 and their role in cancer risk.
Materials and methods: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study included 407,415 participants. Data were
obtained from the 2000–2015 Mei Jau Health Examination Database linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry and
Causes of Death datasets. All participants were aged ≥20 years and had no history of cancer. The environmental
exposure were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2-year average PM2.5 at baseline.
Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We adjusted
for covariates including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, health behaviors, biochemical data, and
environmental factors.
Results: During a median follow-up of 10.37 years, 11,576 cancer cases were reported. PM2.5 exposure increased
the risk of all cancers (HR: 1.11, [95% CI: 1.06–1.15]), stomach cancer (HR: 1.27, [1.02–1.58]), endocrine gland
cancer (HR: 2.13, [1.39–3.26]), breast cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.03–1.22]), and lung cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.01–1.24]).
An increase in NDVI reduced the risk of prostate cancer (HR: 0.93, [0.88–0.99]) and lung cancer (HR: 0.95,
[0.91–0.99]). NDVI influenced the incidence of prostate and all cancers by reducing PM2.5 concentrations.
Conclusion: Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with an increased risk of some types of cancers. In contrast,
an increase in environmental green space exposure is associated with lowering of the risk of prostate and lung
cancer.
