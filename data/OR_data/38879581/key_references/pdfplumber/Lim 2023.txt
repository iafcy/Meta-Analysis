BACKGROUND:Airpollutionisacauseoflungcancerandisassociatedwithbladdercancer.However,therelationshipbetweenair
pollution and these cancers inregions oflow pollution is unclear.We investigated associations betweenfineparticulate matter

IncidentlungandbladdercancerwereidentifiedthroughtheWesternAustralianCancerRegistry.RiskswereestimatedusingCox
