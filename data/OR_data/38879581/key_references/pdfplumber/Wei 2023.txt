Background: Epidemiologic evidence on the relationships between air pollution and the risks of primary cancers other than
lung c ancer remained largely lacking. We aimed to examine associations of 10-year exposures to fine particulate matter (PM ) and
2.5
nitrogen dioxide (NO) with risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers.

Methods: For each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort among the national Medicare beneficiaries during 2000 to 2016. We
simultaneously examined the additive associations of six exposures, namely, moving average exposures to PM and NO over the

year of diagnosis and previous 2 years, previous 3 to 5 years, and previous 6 to 10 years, with the risk of first cancer diagnosis after
10 years of follow-up, during which there was no cancer diagnosis.
Results: The cohorts included 2.2 to 6.5 million subjects for different cancers. Exposures to PM and NO were associated with

World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline, we observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the
risks of all cancers, which were translated to hundreds to thousands new cancer cases per year within the cohort per unit increase

Conclusions: These findings suggested substantial cancer burden was associated with exposures to PM and NO, emphasizing

the urgent need for strategies to mitigate air pollution levels.
