Toinvestigatetherelationshipbetweenairpollutionandriskofdeathfrombladdercancer,the
authors conducted a matched case-control study using deaths that occurred in Taiwan from
1995through2005.DataonalleligiblebladdercancerdeathswereobtainedfromtheBureau
ofVitalStatisticsoftheTaiwanProvincialDepartmentofHealth.Thecontrolgroupconsisted
of people who died from causes other than cancer or diseases associated with genitourinary
problems.Thecontrolswerepairmatchedtothecasesbysex,yearofbirth,andyearofdeath.
