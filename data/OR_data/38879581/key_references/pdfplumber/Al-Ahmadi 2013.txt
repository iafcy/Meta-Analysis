Abstract: Air pollution exposure has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of
specific cancers. This study investigated whether the number and incidence of the most
common cancers in Saudi Arabia were associated with urban air pollution exposure,
specifically NO . Overall, high model goodness of fit (GOF) was observed in the Eastern,
2
Riyadh and Makkah regions. The significant coefficients of determination (r2) were higher
at the regional level (r2 = 0.32–0.71), weaker at the governorate level (r2 = 0.03–0.43), and
declined slightly at the city level (r2 = 0.17–0.33), suggesting that an increased aggregated
spatial level increased the explained variability and the model GOF. However, the low
GOF at the lowest spatial level suggests that additional variation remains unexplained.
At different spatial levels, associations between NO concentration and the most common
2
cancers were marginally improved in geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis,
which explained both global and local heterogeneity and variations in cancer incidence.
High coefficients of determination were observed between NO concentration and lung and
2
breast cancer incidences, followed by prostate, bladder, cervical and ovarian cancers,
confirming results from other studies. These results could be improved using individual
explanatory variables such as environmental, demographic, behavioral, socio-economic,
and genetic risk factors.

1. Introduction
A thorough understanding of the consequences of air pollutants on public health is essential for the
progress of functioning policies to decrease the negative impact of ambient air pollution [1]. Mounting
evidence indicates that exposure to air pollution might be associated with an increased risk of adverse
health effects. An association has been reported between exposure to pollutants, such as particulate
matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO ) and ozone (O ), and increases in hospital admissions for
2 3
cardiovascular and respiratory disease and mortality in Europe and the United Sates [2].
Several studies have found a relationship between the risk of developing cancer and exposure to air
pollution [3–5], and many have concluded that long-term exposure to PM air pollution is positively
associated with increased lung cancer mortality [6–8]. Nyberg et al. [4] used nitrogen oxide
(NOx)/NO and SO as air pollution indicators from road traffic and heating and found that urban air
2 2
pollution increased lung cancer risk. Based on the well-documented urban/rural difference in lung
cancer incidence in Oslo, Nafstad et al. [5] found that the adjusted risk ratio for developing lung cancer
was associated with NOx exposure between 1974 and 1978. Vineis et al. [9] assessed the relationship
between air pollution (NO , PM , and SO ) and lung cancer in Europe. They found an association
2 10 2
between lung cancer and NO , while no obvious association was observed for other pollutants.
2
In another recent study, an estimated 5%–7% of lung cancers in European non-smokers and
ex-smokers could be attributed to exposure to high levels of air pollution, including NO , or vicinity to
2
heavy-traffic roads [10]. Evidence for an association between long-term exposure to air pollution
and lung cancer is not limited to populations in Western countries. A study conducted by Katanoda
et al. [11] demonstrated that long-term exposure to air pollution (PM , SO and NO ) was related to
2.5 2 2
the development of lung cancer and respiratory diseases in Japan. Raaschou-Nielsen et al. [12] found a
relationship between NOx concentration and lung cancer risk and living within 50 m of a major road.
Although most studies have focused on the association between air pollution and lung cancer, there
is evidence that air pollution is associated with an increased risk for other cancers. Castano-Vinyals
et al. [13] reported small-to-moderate positive relationships between bladder cancer and a number of
air pollution indicators. A trend analysis conducted in Taiwan demonstrated a significant relationship
between increases in air pollution and risk of death from bladder cancer [14]. Crouse et al. [15]
examined whether postmenopausal breast cancer was related to urban air pollution using NO as an
2
indicator of air pollution. They found an approximately 25% increased risk of postmenopausal breast
cancer for every 5 ppb increase in exposure to the ambient NO concentration. Raaschou-Nielsen
2
et al. [16] investigated the association between traffic-related air pollution and risk for cancers other
than lung cancer; they modeled the NOx concentration and traffic at the residence level as air pollution
indicators from traffic. NOx at the residence level was considerably related to brain and cervical
cancer risk. Rosenlund et al. [17] temporally analyzed all of the cancer cases that occurred in
Stockholm County between 1985 and 1996 and suggested that long-term exposure to traffic-generated
air pollutants such as NO increases the risk of cancer. Based on a follow-up evaluation that was
2
conducted in 1999 and 2000 using annual average air pollution exposure data from 1991 to 2000, Kan
and Gu [18] found significant associations between air pollutants (TSP, SO and NOx) and mortality
2
from lung cancer in China. Using time-varying Cox proportional hazards models, Yorifuji et al. [19]
provided support for the prevailing evidence that long-term exposure to traffic-related NO air
2
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5846
pollution increases the risk of cardiopulmonary mortality as well as lung cancer mortality. In a
Canadian study, Hystad et al. [20] developed spatiotemporal models to investigate lung cancer
incidence in relation to long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and found that lung cancer
incidence increased most with NO and PM exposure.
2 2.5
However, other studies have reported a moderate, low or no evidence of association between the
risk of adverse health effects and air pollution. Beelen et al. [21], for example, investigated the
association between lung cancer incidence and air pollution using exposure to black smoke, NO ,
2
SO and PM as well as traffic intensity variables as air pollution indicators. The relative risks were
2
slightly below unity for the overall air pollution concentrations, while they were slightly elevated for
the traffic variables.
Exposure to air pollution such as NO might be considered to be one environmental risk factor for
2
cancer; however, cancer incidence rates are influenced by a combination of genetic, demographic,
socio-economic and environmental risk factors [22–32]. Regrettably, there seems to be a lack of data
on these covariates in Saudi Arabia, and thus these covariates could not be analyzed in the present study.
Most of the abovementioned studies used either logistic regression or classical global regression
techniques, such as ordinary least square (OLS) regression, which presuppose that the relationship
between cancer and air pollution is spatially invariant, homogeneous and stationary, i.e., there are no
local variations in the associations between the dependent and explanatory variables. The concept of
stationarity is central in the analysis of spatial and temporal variations. A stationary process is a
process that has similar properties at all locations in the area of interest. A stationary model has the
same parameters at all locations, whereas a non-stationary model allows the parameters to vary
locally [33]. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local spatial statistical method used to
examine spatial non-stationarity by allowing the associations between variables to vary from location
to location [34]. GWR is a simple but powerful method for exploring non-stationary spatial
relationships. It is a useful exploratory analytical tool that generates a set of location-specific
parameter estimates that can be mapped and analyzed to provide information about spatial
non-stationarity in the relationships between the predictors and the outcome variable [35]. The core
principle underlying several local methods is the notion of spatial dependency: features close together
in space tend to be more similar than features that are farther apart. This principle was termed the
“First Law of Geography” by Tobler [36]. GWR is capable of extending the same principle to
regression analysis [33].
The applications of GWR have grown rapidly in various fields, including sociology, health and
demography [35]. GWR studies in health fields include the analysis of health and disease [37–40],
health care delivery [41], the spatially varying relationships between immature mosquitoes and human
population density [42] and gastric cancer in Taiwanese ethnic communities [43]. Mandal et al. [44]
used OLS and GWR to examine whether breast cancer in females and prostate cancer in males were
correlated at the county level in the United States using age-adjusted county-level average annual
incidence rates for Caucasians. GWR revealed a more pronounced association than did OLS, and the
parameter estimates computed for each county in the GWR model helped to determine that over 76%
of the counties had a significant positive association between breast and prostate cancer. A more
relevant study to the present research was conducted by Gilbert and Chakraborty [45], who stated that
the spatial association between the cumulative cancer risk from exposure to hazardous air pollutants
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5847
and explanatory variables such as race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status is not stationary throughout
Florida’s census tracts. They found that conventional multivariate regression techniques such as OLS
cannot reveal the local variations in these associations, whereas GWR allowed them to examine the
spatial variation within the study area for each individual model coefficient.
Cancer incidence and mortality demonstrate non-stationary processes with regional variation and
spatial drift, as they occur at different rates in different places. However, few studies in the literature
have reported the use of GWR to assess the relationship between cancer incidence and tropospheric
NO . The present study aimed to investigate whether the number and incidence of the most common
2
cancers in Saudi Arabia were significantly associated with exposure to urban air pollution (using NO
2
as an indicator) using OLS and GWR in a Geographical Information System (GIS).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cancer Data
Incidences of cancer were obtained from the Saudi Arabian Cancer Registry (SCR) [46]. The cancer
dataset included data on diagnosed incidences of cancer in Saudi nationals from January 1998 to
December 2004. A total of 45,532 cancer patients were diagnosed during this period. Many cancer
indices have been devised to express the occurrence of cancer and other diseases in each zone. Three
of the most common indices for cancer research are the crude incidence rate (CIR), the age-specific
incidence rate (AIR) and the age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) [47,48]. In this study, the CIR for
a particular cancer site in the human body is the total number of cases registered as a proportion of the
total population. All rates were expressed as per 100,000 population. The CIR per 100,000 can readily
be calculated by dividing the total number of cases of a particular cancer type by the population and
multiplying the result by 100,000. Although age is a well-known covariate for cancer incidence, in the
present study, the CIR was considered as opposed to an ASR. This decision was made because
population data by age group are only available at the regional level, not at the governorate and city
levels, and thus, ASRs could not be computed for governorates and cities. Furthermore, to ensure the
consistency of the cancer rates for comparison across the three spatial levels, the CIR was most
appropriate measure.
The spatial cancer incidence database in Saudi Arabia was designed and developed in the form of
an ESRI File Geodatabase on three spatial levels: regional, governorates and cities. Saudi Arabia is
divided into thirteen regions; each region is divided into governorates, and each governorate includes a
number of cities. The cancer database we obtained had records for individual cancer cases. However,
the location of each cancer case was not included. To develop a spatial cancer database, the individual
cancer cases were aggregated into city, governorate, regional and national levels. Starting from the city
level, all of the cancer cases located in the same city were grouped and aggregated to be represented by
that city. Next, all of the cancer cases located in certain cities belonging to a specific governorate were
grouped together and represented by that governorate. At the regional level, all of the cancer cases
in certain governorates belonging to a specific region were grouped together and represented by
that region.

2.2. NO Data
2
NO is an omnipresent atmospheric pollutant due to the extensive prevalence of both natural and
2
anthropogenic sources, and is a primarily man-made gas. NO is produced in the environment as the
2
main emission nitrogen oxides (NOx). The NOx that yield NO are emitted naturally by biomass
2
burning (e.g., forest fires), lightning, and microbial activity in the soil, while they are emitted due to
anthropogenic activities by fossil fuel and biofuel combustion, power plants, heavy industry and
vehicular traffic, making it a strong indicator of vehicle emissions. NO (and other NOx) is a
2
forerunner of a number of harmful secondary air pollutants, including nitric acid and photo oxidants
(including ozone) [1,49,50].
Figure 1. Distribution of mean tropospheric NO column density, 2003–2010.
2
The mean tropospheric NO column density data for cities in Saudi Arabia (Figure 1) were
2
extracted from a global NO pollution map produced by the Satellite Group in the Max-Planck-
2
Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany [51]. The image shows the global mean tropospheric NO
2
column density between 2003 and 2010 using Envisat observations as measured by the SCIAMACHY
instrument on ESA’s Envisat, the world’s largest satellite for environmental monitoring.
“SCIAMACHY is an imaging spectrometer whose primary mission objective is to perform global
measurements of trace gases in the troposphere and in the stratosphere. The solar radiation
transmitted, backscattered and reflected from the atmosphere is recorded at relatively high resolution
(0.2 µm to 0.5 µm) over the range 240 nm to 1700 nm, and in selected regions between 2.0 µm and
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5849
2.4 µm. SCIAMACHY has three different viewing geometries: nadir, limb, and sun/moon occultations
which yield total column values as well as distribution profiles in the stratosphere and (in some cases)
the troposphere for trace gases and aerosols. The nadir and limb viewing strategy of SCIAMACHY
yields total column values as well as profiles for trace gases and aerosols in the stratosphere.
Additionally, this enables estimates of global trace gas and aerosol content and distribution in the
lower stratosphere and troposphere. The measurements obtained from SCIAMACHY enable the
investigation of a wide range of phenomena which influence atmospheric chemistry such as
measurement in the troposphere: biomass burning, pollution, arctic haze, forest fires, dust storms,
industrial plumes; and measurement in the stratosphere: ozone chemistry, volcanic events and solar
proton events. The spatial resolution of SCIAMACHY depends on the wavelength region and also on
the solar zenith angle. For most NO measurements, the area is 60 × 30 km2. Currently, the analysis is
2
based on a rather limited set of both uncalibrated and calibrated data that have been released by ESA,
and therefore has to be considered as preliminary” [50]. A description of the retrieval algorithm used
and an application to long-term changes of tropospheric NO2 can be found in Richter et al. [52].
Using the global mean tropospheric NO column density map, we first isolated the area of Saudi
2
Arabia from the global map and then georeferenced the clipped map (Figure 1). The NO values were
2
first extracted for Saudi cities using the Sample function with the nearest resampling algorithm, and
then we aggregated the NO values at the governorate and regional levels using the Zonal Statistics
2
function in ESRI ArcGIS. An issue associated with the aggregated NO is the method by which the
2
geographic boundaries of regions and governorates are defined; this difficulty is known as the
modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) [53].
2.3. Spatial Statistical Analysis
GWR is a reasonably recent contribution to modeling spatially heterogeneous processes. Using
GWR, parameters can be estimated anywhere in the study area given a dependent variable and a set of
one or more independent variables measured at areas whose location is known [34,54–57]. In contrast
to the global regression model OLS, GWR can estimate discrete coefficients for each observation, i.e.,
geographic features. GWR extends the conventional OLS linear regression models that mask significant
local variation. The key difference between global and local analyses is that global estimation uses one
model for all observations, while GWR estimates a particular local model for each location in space.
GWR is capable of generating parameter estimates for every regression point using observations in a
given neighborhood. The parameter estimates are characteristically mapped to highlight spatial
variation [58]. GWR is an extension from global regression to local regression, with the critical idea
that for each regression point i, there is a bump of influence around i described by the weight function
such that sampled observations near i have more influence in the estimation of the parameters than
observations sampled further away [34]. The GWR model can be expressed as follows:
(cid:1877) (cid:3404) (cid:2010) (cid:4666)(cid:1873) ,(cid:1874) (cid:4667) (cid:3397)(cid:3533)(cid:2010) (cid:4666)(cid:1873) ,(cid:1874) (cid:4667)(cid:1876) (cid:3397) (cid:2013)

(cid:1863)
where the dependent variable y is regressed on a set of independent variables, each denoted by x , and
k
the parameters are allowed to vary over space. Here, (u, v) denotes the coordinates of the i-th point in
i i
space, and β (u, v) is a realization of the continuous function β (u, v) at point i; xi1, xi2, . . ., and xip
k i i k i i

are the explanatory variables at point i; and εi are error terms [34,56]. For a given data set, the local
parameters β (u, v) are estimated using the weighted least square procedure. The weights wij for
k i i
j = 1,.., n at each location (u, v) are obtained as a continuous function of the distance between point i
i i
and the other data points.

(cid:3036)(cid:2869) (cid:3036)(cid:2870) (cid:3036)(cid:3041)
In global regression models such as OLS, every point has the same weight, whereas in local
regression models such as the GWR model, the spatial weight of these points decreases with the
distance from the regression point. The weights are computed using a weighting scheme that is known
as a kernel. Following the suggestions of Fotheringham et al. [34], in this study, the spatial adaptive
kernel was applied rather than the fixed kernel because cities are not positioned regularly in the study
area, i.e., they are heterogeneous and clustered in some areas. The spatial context is a function of a
specified number of neighbors. Where the distribution of cities (in this study) is dense, the spatial
context is smaller; where the distribution of cities is sparse, the spatial context is larger. A spatially
adaptive kernel is usually formed by sorting the distances of the sample points from the desired
regression point i and setting the bandwidth so that it includes only the first N observations, where the
optimal value of N is determined by the data. The weight can be computed by using the specified
kernel, setting the value of any observation whose distance is greater than the bandwidth to zero and
excluding them from the local calibration [57]. Although a number of kernels are possible, the
bi-square weighting function is usually used to create adaptive kernels [34] and can be implemented in
ESRI ArcGIS [38]. Gilbert and Chakraborty [45] used the bi-square weighting function to produce
adaptive kernels for the GWR model that examined the spatial association between cumulative cancer
risk from exposure to hazardous air pollutants and explanatory variables such as race, ethnicity and
socioeconomic status. Charlton and Fotheringham [57] stated that the bi-square weighting function is a
near-Gaussian function with the useful property that the weight is zero at a finite distance and can be
expressed as w = [1 − (d /b)2]2, where d is the distance between a calibration point i and a sample
ij ij ij
data point j and b is the distance to the Nth nearest neighbor, also known as the bandwidth.
In GWR, the regression model is adjusted based on the data that are geographically close to a
specific location. In other words, GWR measures parameters within specified distances (named
bandwidths) of each other and weights these parameters from an identified regression reference point
using a spatial weight function. The optimal bandwidth distance or the optimal number of neighboring
units in the GWR can be specified using either cross-validation or Akaike information criterion (AIC)
tests. The AIC is considered the most fitting method for applying the adaptive kernel technique
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5851
because it considers both goodness-of-fit and degrees of freedom [34,58]. In the present study, the
optimal bandwidth size was found by minimizing the AIC value, following previous examples of
GWR application [58–62]. The bandwidth was found by minimizing the AIC value. The AIC criterion
in GWR is computed as in Hurvich et al. [63]:
(cid:3041)(cid:2878)(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:4666)(cid:3020)(cid:4667)
AIC c = 2n log e(cid:2026)(cid:3548) + n log e(2) + (cid:1866)(cid:4676) (cid:4677) (5)
(cid:3041)(cid:2879)(cid:2870)(cid:2879)(cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:4666)(cid:3020)(cid:4667)
where n is the number of observations in the dataset, (cid:2026)(cid:3548) is the estimate of the standard deviation of the
residuals, and tr(S) is the trace of the hat matrix. The AIC can be used to compare models of the same
independent variable and compare the global OLS model with a local GWR model [57]. The OLS and
GWR models were fitted and mapped using ESRI ArcGIS 10.1.
3. Results
Our analysis of the mean tropospheric NO data for cities in Saudi Arabia (Figure 1) indicates that
2
the high vertical column distributions of NO were associated with major cities across Saudi Arabia,
2
including Riyadh (central) and Jeddah (western coast), and cities in the Eastern Province, including
Dammam, Khobar, Jubail, and Ras Tanura.
A total of 45,532 cancer cases (22,930 males and 22,602 females) were diagnosed among Saudi
Nationals between January 1998 and December 2004. In Saudi Arabia, the overall CIR between 1998
and 2004 was 42.41 per 100,000 people in the population (42.61 among males and 42.22 among
females) (Figure 2), which indicates that cancer incidence is low among Saudi nationals. In a
comparison of the CIRs of overall cancers in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries [25], the
rate observed among Saudis was lower than that observed in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman
(51–93 among males and 47–98 among females) between 1998 and 2001 and lower than the
worldwide rate (188 per 100,000) in 2008 [23]. The overall ASR of cancer at all sites in Saudi Arabia
during the period between 1998 and 2004 ranged between 70 and 80 per 100,000 people
(74–80 among males and 68–80 among females). Therefore, Saudi Arabia exhibited a lower ASR than
did other GCC countries, such as Qatar (male: 165.5; female: 172.4) and Bahrain (male: 157.7; female:
144.6) between 1998 and 2001 [25]; the ASR of Saudi Arabia was also lower than the worldwide
ASRs of 204 and 165 per 100,000 for males and females, respectively, in 2008 [23]. Liver cancer was
the most common, accounting for 8.84% of all cancers in males, followed closely by non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma (NHL) with 8.80% and leukemia with 8.19%; colorectal cancer ranked 4th, followed by
lung and prostate cancers. In females, breast cancer was the most common, accounting for 20.2% of all
cancers in females, followed by thyroid cancer with 9.3%. Colorectal cancer ranked 3rd and was
closely followed by NHL and leukemia. Riyadh region reported 13,063 cancer cases, accounting for
28.69% of all cancer diagnoses between 1998 and 2004, followed by Makkah region, which reported
10,479 cases, accounting for 23.01%, and Eastern province, which reported 7,698 cases, accounting
for 16.91%. These three regions showed a significantly increasing trend in the overall number of
cancer cases diagnosed between 1998 and 2004. Alahsa governorate (located in the Eastern region)
reported the highest CIR, with 284.71 cases per 100,000 population. Ras Tanura governorate (Eastern
region) was second, with a CIR of 113.82 cases per 100,000 population, and Shagra governorate
ranked third, with a CIR of 110.96 cases per 100,000 population. Baha, Jeddah, Riyadh, Jazan,
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5852
Dammam and Al-Khobar were among the governorates with the highest rates of all cancers, with CIRs
ranging from 53.98 to 69.15 per 100,000 population. Samtah city (Jazan region) reported the highest
CIR, with 177.13 per 100,000 population, and Al Qatif city (Eastern region) was second, with a CIR of
173.1 per 100,000 population. Al-Khobar, Shagra, Jazan, Alqunfidhah and Sarat Abidah were among
the cities with the highest CIRs of all cancers, which ranged between 135.55 and 171.1 per 100,000
population (Table 1, Figures 2 and 3).

Figure 2. Crude incidence rate (CIR) of all cancers by year.
The association between the mean tropospheric NO and the number and incidence rates of the most
2
common cancers in Saudi Arabia at the region, governorate and city levels were examined using OLS
and GWR. A significant association was found, but substantially smaller and less robust associations
were also observed. It was found that the number of cancer cases has strong associations with CIR
(r2 = 0.80, 0.73 and 0.84 for all cases, males and females respectively) and ASR (r2 = 0.76, 0.64 and
0.80 for all cases, males and females respectively). This justifies the use of the number of cancer cases
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5853
in the analysis to detect association between cancer and NO . Tables 2–4 show the associations
2
between NO and the most common cancers at the region, governorate and city levels.

At the regional level (Table 2), the OLS method indicated that the numbers of lung, prostate,
Hodgkin’s disease, bladder and breast cancers (r2 = 0.62, 0.56, 0.55, 0.55 and 0.50, respectively,
p < 0.05) were significantly positively associated with NO . While using the CIR, the main significant
2
associations were positive associations between NO and breast, prostate and lung cancers (r2 = 0.71,
2
0.61 and 0.59, respectively, p < 0.05). It was found that ASR at the regional level has a stronger
association with NO (r2 = 0.51, 0.49 and 0.52 for all cases, males and females respectively) than does
2
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5855
CIR (r2 = 0.43, 0.37 and 0.47 for all cases, males and females respectively). This implies that if we
have data for ASR at finer geographic levels, they might have stronger associations with NO as well.
2
At the governorate level (Table 3), the overall values of the coefficient of determination r2 were
generally less than those found at the regional level. At the spatial governorate level, the OLS method
indicated that the numbers of diagnosed breast, lung, bladder, cervical and ovarian cancers (r2 = 0.33,
0.32, 0.31, 0.33 and 0.33, p < 0.05) were the highest in terms of a significant association with NO .
2
However, the spatial autocorrelation of breast cancer violated the assumption of independence based
on the clustered standardized residual error.
The significant associations between NO and the CIRs of the most common cancers were low
2
among the most common cancers, and the highest was found for colorectal and all cancers (r2 = 0.06,
p < 0.05). Using the GWR method, the highest significant correlation was found between NO and the
2
number of diagnosed lung cancers (r2 = 0.43). The CIR of lung cancer showed the highest correlation
(r2 = 0.44), but the spatial autocorrelation violated the assumption of independence based on the
clustered standardized residual error. A significant correlation between NO and the CIR of the most
2
common cancers was also found for breast and prostate cancers (r2 = 0.39 and 0.31, respectively).
At the cities level (Table 4), the overall values of the coefficient of determination r2 were generally
lower than those found at the regional and governorate levels. At this spatial level, OLS and GWR
were applied for the number of diagnosed cancers and the CIR. Using OLS, the highest significant
association with NO was found for the number of lung cancer diagnoses (r2 = 0.23, p < 0.05), while
2
for the CIR, there was no significant association (r2 ≤ 0.0003, p > 0.05). Using GWR, the highest
significant correlation was found between NO and the number of lung cancer diagnoses (r2 = 0.33)
2
followed by cervical, ovarian and breast cancers (r2 = 0.30, 0.29 and 0.29, respectively). Regarding
the CIR, the highest significant correlation was found for Hodgkin’s disease (r2 = 0.22), whereas the
other most common cancers were violated by the spatial autocorrelation of clustered standardized
residual error. Overall, high coefficients of determination (r2) were observed in the Eastern, Riyadh
and Makkah regions and in their governorates and cities.
4. Discussion
This study aimed to investigate whether the number of cases and incidence of the most common
cancers in Saudi Arabia between 1998 and 2004 were significantly associated with exposure to NO
2
urban air pollution using the OLS and GWR models in GIS. This study is the first in Saudi Arabia and
the region to use spatial and non-spatial cancer data, the spatial cofounding factor (i.e., distribution
surface of NO ), and the methods applied.
2
The high NO concentrations in the major cities across Saudi Arabia could be attributed to vehicle
2
emissions and the chemical industries. Additionally, the Eastern region contains Saudi Arabia’s
massive petroleum resources, as it is home to most of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. The province is
also home of the City of Jubail, which hosts the Jubail Industrial City, a global hub for chemical
industries and the largest industrial city in the Middle East. It also holds the Middle East’s largest and
the world’s fourth largest petrochemical company. The Eastern region also encompasses Ras Tanura
city, which is a major oil port and oil operations center for Saudi Aramco, the largest oil company in
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5856
the world. The NO concentrations in Riyadh and Jeddah, the two largest cities in Saudi Arabia, could
2
be attributed to the large number of cars and urban activities.
There were statistically significant associations between the concentration of NO air pollution and
2
the most common cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2004 in Saudi Arabia. This result can be
explained by the fact that NO is much more concentrated in urban areas, where more cancer cases
2
occur because of the size of the population. However, the coefficient of determination of these
associations varied between the spatial levels of analysis (regions, governorates and cities), the
methods used (OLS and GWR), the measurement of cancer data employed (diagnosed number or CIR)
and the diagnosed cancer sites. Notably, the only results considered in this study were those significant
at p < 0.05 and the standardized residual errors that were not spatially autocorrelated.
Regarding the spatial level of analysis, the significant coefficients of determination (r2) were higher
at the regional level (r2 =0.32–0.71), weaker at the governorate level (r2 =0.03–0.43) and declined
slightly at the city level (r2 = 0.17–0.33). The finding that the association was higher at the regional
level may be attributable to the rural/urban variability in NO , which is fairly visible in Figure 1.
2
However, the low values of the coefficients of determination at the lowest spatial level (i.e., cities)
suggest that additional variation remains unexplained. Thus, factors other than NO may be associated
2
with the risk of cancer.
Robinson [64] coined the terms “ecological fallacy” and “ecological correlation”, which refer to the
inappropriate use of an aggregated statistic to make inferences about an individual. This study is
considered an ecological correlation because the units of analysis in this study were people within
cities, governorates and regions but not individual people: i.e., ecological inferences about the
individual were drawn from aggregate data. This is a common concern in ecological studies in which
exposure and response are quantified only for aggregates and not individuals [65].
Regarding the methods used, only the OLS method was applied at the regional level because there
are thirteen administrative regions in Saudi Arabia, and the minimum recommended number of
features to apply GWR is 100. Using OLS, the significant coefficients of determination at the regional
level were high (r2 = 0.32–0.71). At the governorate and city levels, GWR indicated that the
associations between the concentration of NO air pollution and the most common cancers were
2
marginally improved (r2 = 0.03–0.33 using OLS and r2 = 0.03–0.43 using GWR for governorates;
r2 = 0.17–0.23 using OLS and r2 = 0.17–0.33 using GWR for cities). Therefore, a non-stationary local
model (i.e., GWR) gave a much better account than a global model (i.e., OLS) for spatial estimation
and prediction. Although global models mask widespread local variation, local models increase
prediction accuracy by offering the opportunity to explore and understand local variations and
allowing the spatial drift of regression parameters to be identified, estimated and mapped.
Regarding the employed measurement of cancer data, regardless of the spatial level of analysis or
the method used, the significant coefficients of determination were r2 = 0.17–0.62 using the number of
diagnosed cancer cases, whereas they were r2 = 0.05–0.71 using the CIRs. This finding suggests that a
correlation exists between NO and cancer development. A high association between cancers and NO
2 2
exposure for both the number and incidence rate might imply that such a relationship is highly focused
on urban areas with a high population and high NO concentration due to urban and industrial
2
activities. This result is largely factual, particularly when one examines the areas with a high
association between the two variables. Areas with high associations were clustered in the Eastern and
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5857
Riyadh regions. The industrial and petrochemical activities in Saudi Arabia are largely located in the
Eastern Province, which is the largest producer of oil and related petrochemical activities worldwide as
well as a high densely populated area. By contrast, the Riyadh region includes the capital city and is
the most populated area in the country.
In terms of tumor location, a high association was observed between the concentration of NO air
2
pollution and the risk of developing lung and breast cancers, followed by prostate, bladder, cervical
and ovarian cancers. This finding corroborates results from other studies. For example, associations
have been reported between NO and lung cancer [4,6–8,11], breast cancer [14], bladder cancer [13]
2
and cervical and brain cancers [16].
However, this study is limited because the study cohorts were cancer incidence rates between 1998
and 2004 versus the NO concentration between 2003 and 2010. Exposure must precede the outcome,
2
and a decade may be required for cancer to develop. It would have been preferable to use NO data for
2
previous decades; unfortunately, such data were not available. One could argue that the overall pattern
and trend in the NO concentration may not have changed substantially. Outdoor NO air pollution can
2 2
mainly be attributed to power plants, heavy industrial activities and vehicular traffic. Al-Jeelani [66]
stated that there is a lack of data about air pollution generated by power plants in Saudi Arabia and that
the most significant source of air pollutants such as NO is automobiles. The number of automobiles in
2
most Saudi cities increases in tandem with population growth. Heavy industrial activities in Saudi
Arabia were established a few decades ago and are concentrated in certain major regions: Eastern,
Riyadh and Makkah. Therefore, it can be claimed that the overall pattern and trends related to NO
2
concentration may not have changed significantly between 1998 and 2004 compared with the period
between 2003 and 2010. Moreover, exposure to air pollutants such as NO is one environmental risk
2
factor for cancer. However, cancer incidence is explained by a combination of genetic, demographic,
socio-economic, environmental, behavioral and cultural risk factors. In particular, the variations in
cancer incidence are probably associated with many variables, including population aging and growth,
tobacco smoking status (intensity and duration), occupational exposures, environmental exposures and
factors, dietary habits (including unhealthy dietary habits), physical inactivity, the prevalence of
obesity, genetic factors, the lack of screening programs and the accessibility of specialized cancer
centers [22–32]. Regrettably, there appears to be a lack of data on these covariates in Saudi Arabia,
and thus, they could not be analyzed in the present study.
5. Conclusions
This study is the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia because it relied on reliable cancer data acquired
from the Saudi Cancer Registry, the spatial database of cancer incidence rates developed by the
authors and the global NO map created using the Envisat observations, as measured by the
2
SCIAMACHY instrument on ESA’s Envisat. Additionally, the statistical methodology employed in
this study was a combination of global models, such as OLS, and local spatial statistical models, such
as GWR, which captured and explained both the global and local heterogeneity and variations in the
number of cancer cases and incidence rates. However, there is a lack of information on other
contributing (cofounding) factors. Although an association was found between exposure to NO air
2
pollution and the development of some cancers, these inferences may be inaccurate to a certain extent
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2013, 10 5858
because they are uncertainly supported by the aggregate data. If exposure to NO was found in
2
individual-level data, the inferences would be more reliable and could be used strategically to create
health policies, health planning services and preventive policies and to control emissions.
Environmental, demographic, behavioral, socio-economic, genetic and other risk factors are of great
importance in spatial epidemiological studies of cancer. Countries with noticeable industrial
expansions and increased burden of cancer such as Saudi Arabia should establish a nationwide spatial
database of risk factors at the individual level. Such data will be vital for spatial epidemiological
studies and for studies related to more general health concerns.
