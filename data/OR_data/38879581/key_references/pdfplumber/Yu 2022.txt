a difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, was applied to examine PM2.5-cancer mor-
tality associations. Globally gridded annual average surface PM2.5 concentration was extracted and linked with
the residential municipality of participants in this study. Sex, age stratified and exposure-response estimations
were also conducted. Totalling 1,768,668 adult cancer deaths records of about 208 million population living
across 5,565 municipalities were included in this study. The average PM2.5 concentration was 7.63 μg/m3
(standard deviation 3.32) with range from 2.95 μg/m3 to 28.5 μg/m3. With each 10 μg/m3 increase in three-year-
average (current year and previous two years) concentrations of PM2.5, the relative risks (RR) of cancer mortality
were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11–1.20) for all-site cancers. The PM2.5 exposure was significantly
associated with several cancer-specific mortalities including oral, nasopharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, colon
rectum, liver, gallbladder, larynx, lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix, prostate, brain and leukaemia. No safe
level of PM2.5 exposure was observed in the exposure-response curve for all types of cancer. In conclusion, with
nationwide cancer death records in Brazil, we found that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increased risks of
mortality for many cancer types. Even low level PM2.5 concentrations had significant impacts on cancer
mortality.
