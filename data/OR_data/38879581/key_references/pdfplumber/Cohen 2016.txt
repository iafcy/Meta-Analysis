Abstract
Background: Previous studies suggested a carcinogenic effect of exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Recently,
higher rates of cancer incidence were observed among myocardial infarction survivors compared with the general
population. We examined the association between chronic exposure to nitrogen oxides, a proxy measure for traffic-
related air pollution, and cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of myocardial infarction patients.
Methods:Patientsaged(cid:2)65yearsadmittedtohospitalincentralIsraelwithafirstmyocardialinfarctionin1992–1993
were followed to 2013 for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality. Data on sociodemographic and cancer risk
factorswereobtained,includingtime-varyinginformationonsmoking.Usinglanduseregressionmodels,annualaverages
ofnitrogenoxidesduringfollow-upwereestimatedindividuallyaccordingtohomeaddresses.Coxproportionalhazards
models were constructed to study the relationships with cancer outcomes.
Results:Duringameanfollow-upof16(SD7)years,262incidentcancersand105cancerdeathswereidentifiedamong
1393 cancer-free patients at baseline (mean age 54 years; 81% men). In adjusted models, a 10ppb increase in mean
nitrogen oxide exposure was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–1.18) for
cancer incidence and HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.93–1.26) forcancer mortality. The association with lung, bladder, kidneyor
prostate cancer (previously linked to air pollution) was stronger (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00–1.33).
Conclusions: Chronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution may constitute an environmental risk factor forcancer
post-myocardialinfarction.Variationinthestrengthofassociationbetweenspecificcancersneedstobeexploredfurther.

pre-existing chronic heart diseases.43,44 Along with this
assumption and taking into consideration common

risk for the different types of cancers, observed a par-
ticularly higher risk for prostate,46 lung and bladder
cancers,17 yet no increased risk for colorectal
cancer.47 In addition, in recent decades a shift in the
long-term cause of death after MI has been reported
from cardiovascular to non-cardiovascular,22 with
cancer as one of the main causes of death.23
While adverse health effects of air pollution, includ-
ing all-cause mortality, among MI survivors have pre-
viously been investigated,44,48 its carcinogenic effect
among this population in terms of both incidence and
mortality has received very little attention. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to specifically
examine the relationship between exposure to air pol-
lutionandcanceroutcomesamongthishigh-riskpopu-
lation of MI survivors.
Methodological considerations
Ourstudyhasseveralstrengths.First,thestudysample
is a well-defined post-MI cohort, a population estab-
lished as vulnerable to the effects of air pollution, as
wellasbeinggeographicallydefined,therebyimproving
relevance and generalisability. Second, residential NO x
levels,servingasaproxyforTRAP,wereestimated by
LUR,whichwasdevelopedusinga20-yearlongrecord
(1992(cid:3)2011) of national air quality monitoring net-
work data in Israel, incorporating extensive spatial
information on a national scale. The role of NO as a x
marker for TRAP is most plausible in urban settings,
where traffic is often the primary source of NO in the
x
atmosphere and the main source of variability in NO
x
levels.1Therefore,wefindourexposuremetricssuitable
toestimatetheeffectoftrafficpollutioncarcinogenicity.
Third,addressconfirmationconducted5yearsafterthe
baseline enabled us to account for residential mobility.
Although we were not able to identify individuals who
changed their addresses in the remaining time of the
follow-up, we assume that a small proportion of par-
ticipants changed their residential addresses in the late
yearsofthefollow-up,astheparticipants’meanageat
the second interview was 59 years. Fourth, extensive
high quality clinical and sociodemographic data were
available from multiple sources, including medical
records and structured interviews, allowing us more
