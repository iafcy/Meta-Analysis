Abstract
Background: There are a few epidemiological studies that (1) linkincreased ambient air pollution (AP) withan
increase inlung cancer incidence rates and (2) investigate whether residing in green spaces could be protective
against cancer. However, it is completely unclear whether otherforms of cancer are also affected by AP and if
residential green spaces could lower cancer incidence rates in general. Therefore, the objective was to estimate
whether AP and green space are associated with several cancer types.
Methods: Theanalysiswasbasedonroutinehealthcaredatafromaround1.9millionpeoplefromSaxonywhowere

cancer - NMSC), prostate, breast, and colorectum were defined as: (1) one inpatient diagnosis, or (2) two
outpatient diagnoses in two different quarters within one year and a specific treatment or death within two
quarters after the diagnosis. Exposures, derived from freely available 3rd party data, included particulate matter
with aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM ) and nitrogen dioxide (N0 ) as well as green space
