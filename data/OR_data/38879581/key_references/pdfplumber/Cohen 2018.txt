were slightly strengthened after limiting the cohort to patients with more precise exposure assessment.
Conclusion: Coronary patients exposed to TRAP are at increased risk of several types of cancer, particularly lung,
prostate and breast. As these cancers are amenable to prevention strategies, identifying highly exposed patients may
provide an opportunity to improve clinical care.

estimates produced by the LUR model are obtained
on a very high-resolution (50-m) grid (see map in
Figure 2), enabling us to detect small-scale variability
in pollutant levels that is mainly attributed to local
sources in urban settings.52 Second, seeking to reduce
the uncertainty of exposure estimates, we performed a
sensitivity analysis in which we restricted our cohort

were observed for all cancer outcomes, implying a
stronger association attributed to more precise expos-
ure estimates. Third, NO levels served as an indicator x
