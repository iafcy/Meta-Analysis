Alanduseregressionmodel(Weichenthaletal.,2016)wasusedto
estimate ambient concentrations of UFPs at participants’ residences
acrosstheislandofMontreal.Briefly,thismodelwasderivedfromdata
collected during a mobile monitoring campaign conducted between
2011 and 2012, and it included information from 414 road segments
across Montreal. Model parameters included variables for park space
(200-meter buffer), open space (100-meter buffer), local roads (100-
meter buffer), length of rail (100-meter buffer), and annual NOx
emissions (100-meter buffer) as well as parameters for long-term
average temperature and wind speed in Montreal. The R2 value from
theland-useregressionmodelwas0.62andthecross-validationR2was
0.60. This model was used to assign UFP exposures to geocoded
