Methods: Using the UK Biobank (UKBB) prospective cohort, we selected 12 local environment exposures: nitrogen

oxides, nitrogen dioxides, particulate matter (10 and 2.5 μm), noise pollution, urban traffic, living distance from
the coast, percentage of greenspace, natural environment, water, and domestic garden within 1000 m from the
residential coordinates of each participant. All these exposures were tested for association with 17 different types
of cancer for a total of 53,270 cases and 302,645 controls. Additionally, a polygenic score (PGS) was computed
for each cancer, to test possible gene-environment interactions. Finally, mediation analyses were carried out.
Results: Thirty-six statistically significant associations considering multiple testing (p < 2.19 × 10(cid:0)4) were
observed. Among the novel associations we observed that individuals living farther from the coast had a higher
risk of developing prostate cancer (OR =1.13, CI95% =1.06–1.20, P =1.98 ×10(cid:0)4). This association was
partially mediated by physical activity (indirect effect (IE) =-8.48 ×10(cid:0)7) and the time spent outdoor (IE =
9.07
×10(cid:0)6).
All PGSs showed statistically significant associations. Finally, genome-environment interaction
analysis showed that local environment and genetic variability affect cancer risk independently.
Discussion: Living close to the coast and air pollution were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer and
skin melanoma, respectively. These findings from the UKBB support the role of the local environment on cancer
development, which is independent from genetics and may be mediated by several lifestyle factors.
