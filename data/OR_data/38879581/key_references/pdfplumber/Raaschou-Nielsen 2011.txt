Abstract
Background: Vehicle engine exhaust includes ultrafine particles with a large surface area and containing absorbed
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, transition metals and other substances. Ultrafine particles and soluble chemicals
can be transported from the airways to other organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and brain. Our aim was to
investigate whether air pollution from traffic is associated with risk for other cancers than lung cancer.
Methods: We followed up 54,304 participants in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort for 20 selected cancers
in the Danish Cancer Registry, from enrolment in 1993-1997 until 2006, and traced their residential addresses from
1971 onwards in the Central Population Registry. We used modeled concentration of nitrogen oxides (NO ) and

amount of traffic at the residence as indicators of traffic-related air pollution and used Cox models to estimate
incidence rate ratios (IRRs) after adjustment for potential confounders.
Results: NO at the residence was significantly associated with risks for cervical cancer (IRR, 2.45; 95% confidence

Conclusions: This hypothesis-generating study indicates that traffic-related air pollution might increase the risks for
cervical and brain cancer, which should be tested in future studies.
