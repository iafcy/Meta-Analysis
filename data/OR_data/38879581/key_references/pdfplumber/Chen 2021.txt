Outcome
For all cohorts, except E3N, cancer diagnosis data were obtained from
nationalcancerregistries.InE3N,cancerwasidentifiedbyself-reportsfrom
biannual questionnaires, which were confirmed through pathological
reportsandreviewedbyanoncologist,orfromdeathcertificates.Bladder
cancer incidence was defined as the first primary diagnosis during the
follow-up, according to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision(ICD-9) code188and theInternational Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code C67.
Participantswithanycancerdiagnoses(exceptnon-melanomaskincancer)
