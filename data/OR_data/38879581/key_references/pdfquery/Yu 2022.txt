Difference in differences 
Long-term exposure to PM2.5 has been linked to lung cancer incidence and mortality, but limited evidence existed 
for other cancers. This study aimed to assess the association between PM2.5 on cancer specific mortality. An 
ecological study based on the cancer mortality data collected from 5,565 Brazilian cities during 2010–2018 using 
a difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, was applied to examine PM2.5-cancer mor- 
tality associations. Globally gridded annual average surface PM2.5 concentration was extracted and linked with 
the residential municipality of participants in this study. Sex, age stratified and exposure-response estimations 
were also conducted. Totalling 1,768,668 adult cancer deaths records of about 208 million population living 
across 5,565 municipalities were included in this study. The average PM2.5 concentration was 7.63 μg/m3 
(standard deviation 3.32) with range from 2.95 μg/m3 to 28.5 μg/m3. With each 10 μg/m3 increase in three-year- 
average (current year and previous two years) concentrations of PM2.5, the relative risks (RR) of cancer mortality 
were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11–1.20) for all-site cancers. The PM2.5 exposure was significantly 
associated with several cancer-specific mortalities including oral, nasopharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, colon 
rectum, liver, gallbladder, larynx, lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix, prostate, brain and leukaemia. No safe 
level of PM2.5 exposure was observed in the exposure-response curve for all types of cancer. In conclusion, with 
nationwide cancer death records in Brazil, we found that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increased risks of 
mortality for many cancer types. Even low level PM2.5 concentrations had significant impacts on cancer 
mortality. 

Despite great progress in diagnosis and treatment, cancer is still a 
major public health problem with poor survival rates (Siegel et al., 
2021). According to the present trends, cancer may become the leading 
cause of premature death in most countries this century (Bray et al., 
2021). The increasing burden due to cancer poses a barrier to sustain- 
able human development and translate into a significant decrease in 
gross domestic product (GDP) (Wild, 2019). Though cancer prevention 
has never stopped, including mainly ongoing smoking bans and cancer 
screening programs, the cancer mortality keeps increasing in Brazil 
(Silva et al., 2020). The direct healthcare costs of cancer also showed an 
increasing trend in Brazil (Zhao et al., 2020). The number of deaths from 
cancer in Brazil are projected to increase 80.9% from 2020 to 2040 
(Ferlay et al., 2020). The fight against cancer is still underway, and 
controlling preventable risk factors is an indispensable part of this fight 
to decrease cancer mortality. 
Environmental pollution is the largest environmental cause of pre- 
mature death, causing estimated 16% of all deaths in 2015 worldwide, 
15 times more than from violence (Landrigan et al., 2018). Long-term 
exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with mortality 
from various non-communicable diseases, including lung cancer (Bowe 
et al., 2019; Katanoda et al., 2011; Pun et al., 2017). The hazardous 
effect of fine particles less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) on lung 
cancer has been well established, but limited evidence supports a causal 
link for mortality from other types of cancer (Turner et al., 2020). The 
current epidemiological studies provided evidence on the potential as- 
sociations between PM2.5 exposure and mortality from other cancers,

like breast or bladder cancer, but only part of them showed significant 
positive association and further studies should be conducted to accu- 
mulate the evidence for PM2.5 on site-specific cancer mortality risk (Yu 
et al., 2021a, 2021b). Studies from the US suggested that the exposure to 
PM2.5 may shorten cancer survival (Coleman et al., 2021; Deng et al., 
2017; Eckel et al., 2016). Assessment for the impacts of long-term 
exposure to PM2.5 on mortality from all types of cancer would inform 
public health measures to improve cancer survival, particularly among 
patients. 
The primary objective of this study was to estimate the association 
between ambient PM2.5 exposure and adult site-specific cancer risk in 
Brazil based on national data using a difference in difference design. The 
secondary objectives were to evaluate whether the PM2.5-cancer mor- 
tality associations varied by sex and age and examine the dose response 
relationship for PM2.5 on cancer mortality. 


Individual level death records from 2010 to 2018 were collected 
from the Brazil Mortality Information System (Sistema de Informaç˜ao 
sobre Mortalidade, SIM) (Morais and Costa, 2017). Each death record 
included information on municipality, age, sex, death date and primary 
cause of death coded according to the International Statistical Classifi- 
cation of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10). 
Cancer death records were totalled for every city-year and grouped as 
follows: oral (C00–C10, C12–C14), nasopharynx (C11), oesophagus 
(C15), stomach (C16), colon-rectum (C18–C21), liver (C22), gallbladder 
(C23–C24), pancreas (C25), larynx (C32), lung (C33–C34), bone 
(C40–C41), skin (C43), breast (C50), cervix (C53), uterine (C54–C55), 
ovary (C56), prostate (C61), testis (C62), kidney (C64–C66), bladder 
(C67), brain (C70–C72), 
leukaemia 
(C91–C95). The death counts were also divided by sex and age groups (i. 
e., male vs. female, aged 20–59 vs. 60+ years). Child and adolescent 
cancers are not the same as adult cancers with different types, treatment 
and survival (Kaatsch, 2010; Stiller, 2002), thus only cancer deaths aged 
≥20 were included in the analyses. Brazil has 5,570 municipalities in 
total, the present study included cancer death records from 5,565 mu- 
nicipalities with complete records for each year between 2010 and 2018. 
In 2018, about 99.98% of Brazilian population lived in the selected 5, 
565 municipalities. 





We used globally gridded annual average surface PM2.5 concentra- 
tion estimates during 2001–2018 at 0.05 
resolution (Hammer 
et al., 2020). The PM2.5 concentration was estimated using the 
GEOS-Chem chemical transport model by combining information from 
aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from the National Aeronautics 
and 
Imaging 
Spectro-Radiometer (MODIS), Multiangle Imaging Spectro Radiometer 
(MISR), and Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor satellite in- 
struments and then calibrated to the ground-based monitor stations 
using geographically weighted regression. These estimates were highly 
consistent with global ground-based observation (cross-validation R2: 
0.90–0.92) (Hammer et al., 2020). Each municipality’s annual average 
PM2.5 level was calculated as the average of PM2.5 estimates for all grids 
in its geographical boundary. The official geographical boundary of 
municipalities was downloaded from the website of the Brazilian Insti- 
tute of Geography and Statistics (BIGS, https://www.ibge.gov.br/pt/in 
icio.html). 
Daily mean temperatures were calculated from hourly temperature 
records from ERA5 reanalysis dataset with a 0.25 
spatial res- 
olution (≈6 km × 6 km) and then calculated to annual mean tempera- 
ture in summer and winter. This dataset has global coverage and is 
comparable to weather station observations in evaluating temperature- 
mortality associations. The city-level temperature was represented by 
the temperature of the grid at the geographical centre of each city (P. Yu 



Municipality-level population sizes were also collected from the SIM. 
City-level GDP per capita for every year during the study period were 
downloaded from the BIGS. We adjusted all GDP per capita statistics to 
United States dollars (USD) at current price, according to the consumer 
price index during 2008–2020 and the average exchange rate in 2020 
(R. Xu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a, 2020b). 

A difference-in-difference (DID) approach with quasi-Poisson 
regression was applied to examine the associations between PM2.5 
exposure and cancer, cancer-specific mortality. The essence of the DID 
design is that the difference in temporal concentrations are related to the 
difference in mortality rates in each location during the study period. 
Thus the factors that keep stable during the study time and time trends in 
confounders that changed similarly across locations are controlled. 
Confounders correlated with the temporal concentrations (PM2.5 con- 
centration in this study) and changed differently across regions by time 
should be adjusted in the model. Temperature has been demonstrated to 
be associated with cancer mortality (Lehrer and Rosenzweig, 2014; 
Sharma et al., 2017). Thus, we fitted change of temperature in the main 
model. In this model, we assumed that temperature, GDP per capita and 
population size that changed differentially across space and over time 
confounded the association between PM2.5 exposure and the risk of 
cancer-specific mortality. We use the conditional Poisson model pa- 
rameters conditioning on spatial units and eliminating the estimates of 
the variables that did not contribute to the likelihood. Cancer-specific 
mortality associations were evaluated using the following model:

β1,β2 are regression coefficients adjusting for confounding induced 


(cid:0) β8 are the regression coefficients for the effects of PM2.5, mean 
summer and winter temperatures and their standard deviations, 
respectively; 




In order to better account for the lagged effect of PM2.5 on cancer 
mortality, PM2.5 concentrations 0–5 years prior the death were also 
extracted and linked by city code. Our initial analyses showed that the 
effect of PM2.5 exposure on cancer mortality was only statistically sig- 
nificant from lag 0 to lag 2 years (Figure S1). Thus, we used the 3-year 
average PM2.5 concentration as the exposure. In summary, Is in the 
model represents the indicators for each municipality which is to control 
the geographical differences (i.e., factors that were stable during the 
time). It represents the indicators for each year which is to control the 
country-wide time trend (i.e., factors that changed parallel across mu- 
nicipalities). Other temporal factors which were not stable or changing 
parallel were also controlled including seasonal temperatures (mean 
temperature in summer and winter and their standard deviation) that 
were correlated with PM2.5, socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita) and 
population size of each municipality in each year. These non-parallel 
factors were defined based on previous studies (Renzi et al., 2019; 



Schwartz et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020).The potential non-linear rela- 
tionship between PM2.5 and mortality was evaluated by applying a 
natural cubic spline with best degrees of freedom (df), i.e. lowest Quasi- 
Bayesian Information Criteria (QBIC), to the PM2.5. 
We also performed subgroup analyses by age groups (20–59 years vs. 
60 years or above) and sex. We used random-effect meta-analyses to 
compare the effect estimates between sex and age groups considering 
the potential differences. All results were expressed as relative risks (RR) 
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) per 10 μg/m3 increase in annual 
average PM2.5 concentration. 
We performed several sensitivity analyses to check the robustness of 
the main findings. We modelled the summer and winter temperatures 
using natural cubic splines with 2 and 3 df; removed GDP per capita 
from the main model; and applying NO2, SO2, O3, CO, Normalized 
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to the main model. 
R software (V3.4.3, www.R-project.org) was used to perform all data 
analyses. The “gnm” package was used to perform conditional Poisson 
regression model. The “mvmeta” package was used to compare the 
subgroup differences. Statistical significance was defined as a two-side 
P-value < 0.05 unless otherwise indicated. In addition, we used a Bon- 
ferroni correction for each of the subgroups and end points. The cut- 
points for statistically significant P values after Bonferroni correction 
are described with each table. 
This study was approved by the Monash University Human Research 
Ethics Committee. The Brazilian Ministry of Health did not require 
ethics approval or informed consent for secondary analysis of aggre- 
gated anonymized data from the SIM. 

A total of 1,768,668 adult cancer deaths records (830,468 females) 
of about 208 million population living across 5,565 cities were included 
in this study. The national average PM2.5 concentration was 7.60 
(standard deviation 3.20) μg/m3 during the study period. PM2.5 con- 
centrations ranged from 3.40 μg/m3 to 21.0 μg/m3 (Table 1). Fig. 1 
shows the average PM2.5 concentrations and average cancer mortality 
rates for municipalities included in the analyses from 2010 to 2018. The 
annual cancer mortality rate was 72.4/100,000 ranging from 0 to 
1,499/100,000. The number of deaths for each cancer site by sex and 
age was presented in Table S1. Cancer distribution was different be- 
tween males and females. Lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer 
death in males and elderly people (≥60 years) while breast cancer was in 
females and younger people (20–59 years). 
Estimated PM2.5-cancer specific mortality associations using the 
current year and lag 1–5 year (1–5 year before the death year) are shown 
in Figure S1. The consistent significant effect is observed from the cur- 
rent year to 2-years before for most cancer sites. Therefore we estimated 
the PM2.5-cancer mortality associations using the 3-year-average PM2.5 
concentrations. Every 10 μg/m3 increase in 3-year-average PM2.5 
exposure was associated with a 15.8% higher risk for total cancer 
mortality (RR = 1.16; 95%CI: 1.11, 1.20) (Fig. 2). The associations were 
robust to changing the df of temperature or covariates in the model. 
Effect estimates from models without adjusting for GDP per capital, 
adding NO2, SO2, O3, CO, NDVI had no statistically significant difference 
from the primary model. We also took drowning and misadventure as 
the negative control which were less association with PM2.5 exposure 
(Table S2). 
Statistically significant positive associations were found for cancers 
of all sites, oral, nasopharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon rectum, liver, 
gallbladder, larynx, lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix, prostate, 
brain and leukaemia. The associations were still significant for total 
cancer and cancers of nasopharynx, stomach, colon rectum, larynx, 
lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix and leukaemia after allowing for 
multiple comparisons (Fig. 2). 
Fig. 3 compares the differences of the associations for cancers 
affected by PM2.5 potentially by sex and age. For all cancers combined,

the RRs did not vary by sex and age, with 1.17 (95%CI: 1.11–1.23) for 
males, 1.15 (1.09–1.21) for females, 1.21 (1.14–1.28) for younger 
people (20–59 years) and 1.22 (1.17–1.28) for older without statistically 
differences (P = 0.656 by sex and P = 0.859 by age). RRs appear higher 
in males than females for cancers of oral, nasopharynx, gallbladder, 
kidney than females, while females had higher RR in skin cancers than 
males. People ≥60 years old had higher RRs than those <60 for cancers 
of nasopharynx, bone, cervix, lymphoma and leukaemia. People <60 
years had higher RRs for oral and testicular cancer than those ≥60 years. 
The relationships between PM2.5 and total cancer mortality modelled 
by natural cubic spline with 1–4 degrees of freedom were similar 
(Figure S2), indicating linear association between PM2.5 and total cancer 
mortality. Similar linear associations were observed for site specific 
cancer risks (Fig. 4, and Table S3). 

This study observed that there are positive associations between 
long-term PM2.5 exposure and adult mortality from most types of cancer 
which is the first study to examine the impacts of long-term exposure to 
ambient PM2.5 on mortality from all common types of adult cancer based 
on national records. Overall, the RR of cancer mortality with each 10 μg/ 
m3 increase in three-year-average concentrations of PM2.5 was 1.16 
(1.11–1.20) for all-site cancers. The estimation was statistically robust 
after applying other covariates into the model. Additionally, age and sex 
differences were observed on the PM2.5-cancer-specific mortality risk.

2010 to 2018. Note: areas in grey were not included in our analyses, thus data were not presented. 
Finally, we did not observe a threshold of ambient PM2.5 concentration 
for cancer mortality, even at low levels below the current WHO air 
quality guideline values (i.e., 5 μg/m3) (WHO, 2020). 
The PM2.5-cancer-specific mortality associations were significant for 
total cancer and cancers of nasopharynx, stomach, colon rectum, larynx, 
lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix and leukaemia even after allow- 
ing for multiple comparisons. This indicated that the adverse effect of 
PM2.5 exposure on cancer mortality may not be limited to lung cancer. 
There are two potential reasons to explain how PM2.5 exposure may 
increase cancer mortality. One is that higher exposure to PM2.5 may 
accelerate cancer progression. Oxidative stress, genotoxicity and 
inflammation were demonstrated to be closely related to the progression 
of cancer (Coussens and Werb, 2002; Gill et al., 2016; Klaunig, 2018; 
Reuter et al., 2010; Roos et al., 2016). PM2.5 can move into interstitial 
spaces between alveoli and towards other organs after breath through 
the air way (Guarnieri and Balmes, 2014) and promote the process of 
these pathways, such as molecular changes (i.e. DNA adducts, gene 
mutations, apoptosis inhibition) and inflammation (i.e. promote the 
inflammation of cytotoxicity of T cells) (Ma et al., 2017; Turner et al., 
2020). Population studies from the US also found that exposed to high 
levels of PM2.5 may have deleterious effects on the survival from breast 
cancer and liver cancer (Deng et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2013) which could 
support the potential explanation. Another is that people diagnosed with 
cancer have weakened immune systems and cancer treatments also 
weaken the immune system and may increase vulnerability to PM2.5 
(Rolston, 2017). PM2.5 exposure also weakens the immune system 
(Glencross et al., 2020). 
For total cancer, we found a 15.8% higher risk associated with each 
10 μg/m3 increase based on the national cancer death records using the 
DID design. Similarly, the results from a representative cohort of the US 
adults showed 15% higher risk (Pope et al., 2019). Cohort study from 
Hong Kong of people older than 65 years reported an estimated 22% 
higher risk which was higher than our study (Wong et al., 2016). 
Considering the genetic background, socioeconomic status, climate, 
component and study design differed in these studies, the evidence is not 
enough to find a possible adaptive response leading to a smaller change 
in cancer mortality rates. Further global studies should be conducted to 
examine the association between PM2.5 and cancer mortality. 
Stratification results suggested that different age or sex groups may 
have different vulnerability at various cancer sites. Significant differ- 
ences were observed that male had greater risks than females for cancers 
of oral, nasopharynx, gallbladder, while greater risk for female skin 
cancers than male in this study. Previous studies showed inconsistent sex 
difference on PM2.5-cancer mortality association (Pope et al., 2019;

§Uncorrected P value was less than the Bonferroni-corrected critical P value. 
Wang et al., 2019). The study from the US reported similar associations 
between PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality in males and females (Pope 
et al., 2019), while the study from China showed significantly higher 
risk in females for lung cancer and leukaemia than males (Wang et al., 
2019). The animal experiment demonstrated that sex-associated differ- 
ences in the effect of PM2.5 exposure on insulin resistance and disorder of 
hepatic lipid metabolism which were closely associated with cancer (Li 
et al., 2020). Estrogen receptor β was also suggested to be involved in the 
PM2.5 organic extract induced inflammation and lung cancer (Luo et al., 
2021). Evidence of a differential effect of PM2.5 on cancer mortality 
across age are limited as well (Coleman et al., 2020; Coleman et al., 
2021; Guo et al., 2020). The current study showed that people older than 
60 years had higher risks for death from cancers of nasopharynx, bone, 
cervix, lymphoma and leukaemia as expected. But younger people were 
more likely to suffer higher risk for oral cancers. The potential reason for 
the similar effect between PM2.5 and cancer mortality by age groups can 
be explained by that 1) some types of cancer mortality were more sen- 
sitive to PM2.5 for younger people than elderly (oral cancer), vice versa 
(cancers of nasopharynx, bone, cervix, lymphoma and leukaemia); 2) 
So, for all cancers combined, the RRs did not vary by age. The mecha- 
nisms underlying the sex and age difference in PM2.5-cancer mortality 
associations are unclear and warrant further investigation. 
Unexpected statistically significant protective associations were 
observed between PM2.5 and cancers of uterus, oral cavity, kidney in 
female and testis in older people. One of the potential explanations that 
could be proposes is that higher PM2.5 exposure may increase the hos- 
pital visits by other diseases at the same site and occasionally lead to 
early detection and early treatment of cancer. Another potential reason 
is the most vulnerable population may die from other severe comor- 
bidities. Study from Taiwan suggested that patients with endometrial 
hyperplasia in poor air quality areas had more severe comorbidities, 
such as diabetes or hypertension (Chang et al., 2019). 
The exposure-response relationships for most cancer sites were 
linear, except for cervix and brain. For the cancer sites with significant 
associations with PM2.5 exposure, the exposure-response curve showed 
no threshold in the current study. This means there may be no safe level 
of PM2.5 exposure for deaths from most cancers. The current study is the 
first to estimate the exposure-response curves for mortality for almost all 
types of cancers, to the best of our knowledge. Some studies estimated 
the lung cancer mortality related to PM2.5 exposure, but the conclusions 
were inconsistent (Guo et al., 2017; Pinault et al., 2017). The PM2.5-lung 
cancer mortality associations were non-linear with thresholds of 40–48 
μg/m3 for various subgroups in China (Guo et al., 2017). A pattern with 
a low HR estimate in the lowest range, a high effect in the middle range, 
and a moderate effect in the highest range was observed in Canadian 
Census Health and Environment Cohort (Pinault et al., 2017). 
A major strength of our study is that we are the first to evaluate the 
association between ambient PM2.5 exposure and cancer-specific mor- 
tality risk based on the nationwide death records covering 99.98% of 
Brazilian population with only 7 cities lost without death records during 
study period. Secondly, exposure-response relationships were also esti- 
mated in a non-linear model to find whether there was safe level of PM2.5 
exposure on cancer mortality. Furthermore, the design of the difference 
in differences method was able to eliminate most unmeasured

This study has several limitations. The PM2.5 exposure was estimated 
at global scale and the regional validation result was not available due to 
limited grounded monitors in Brazil. We could only get the access to the 
municipality-level PM2.5 exposure data, but not individual level data. 
Municipality-level exposure may introduce exposure bias which might 
make the PM2.5-cancer mortality association under-estimated (Hutch- 
eon et al. 2010). The PM2.5 and cancer mortality association was based 
on the PM2.5 exposure by the residential city and the migration of res- 
idents could not be captured. According to the census results in 2010 in 
Brazil published in BIGS, nearly 90% adults had uninterrupted time of 
residence in the municipality at least three years, ranged from 81.4% 
(aged 20–30 year) to 94.9% (age >80 year). The migration may not 
affect the estimation of this study. We used the city-level GDP per capita 
data to represent the socioeconomic status. Some potential trends of 
health behaviours, such as smoking, were not able to be analysed due to 
the limited data. Although smoking was not able to be added in the 
model, the potential changing trend was adjusted by the year in the 
mode, so it should not change the results much. Another study found 
that PM2.5-cancer mortality associations were similar in the full cohort 
compared with the never-smoking population (Coleman et al., 2020). 
Some other potential confounding factors may be ignored in the ana- 
lyses. Besides, the effect of PM2.5 on cancer mortality may be under- 
estimated due to cancer patients dying from other diseases (i.e., 
cardiopulmonary diseases (Coleman et al., 2021; Strongman et al., 
2019)) affected by PM2.5. 

With nationwide death records in Brazil, this study provides evi- 
dence about the cancer mortality risk associated with long-term PM2.5 
exposure, with no safe threshold observed. These results are of sub- 
stantial clinical and public health importance. The exposure-response 
curves also give evidence that further reduction in PM2.5 concentra- 
tions should yield additional public health benefits.
