Outdoor air pollution, green space, and 
cancer incidence in Saxony: a semi- 
individual cohort study 
Thomas Datzmann1,2* 
and Falko Tesch1 


Background: There are a few epidemiological studies that (1) link increased ambient air pollution (AP) with an 
increase in lung cancer incidence rates and (2) investigate whether residing in green spaces could be protective 
against cancer. However, it is completely unclear whether other forms of cancer are also affected by AP and if 
residential green spaces could lower cancer incidence rates in general. Therefore, the objective was to estimate 
whether AP and green space are associated with several cancer types. 
Methods: The analysis was based on routine health care data from around 1.9 million people from Saxony who were 
free of cancer in 2008 and 2009. Incident cancer cases (2010–2014) of mouth and throat, skin (non-melanoma skin 
cancer - NMSC), prostate, breast, and colorectum were defined as: (1) one inpatient diagnosis, or (2) two 
outpatient diagnoses in two different quarters within one year and a specific treatment or death within two 
quarters after the diagnosis. Exposures, derived from freely available 3rd party data, included particulate matter 
with aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (N02) as well as green space 
(Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI). Associations between air pollutants, green space, and cancer incidence 
were assessed by multilevel Poisson models. Age, sex, physician contacts, short- and long-term unemployment, 
population density, and having an alcohol-related disorder were considered as potential confounders. 
Results: Three thousand one hundred seven people developed mouth and throat cancer, 33,178 NMSC, 9611 prostate 
cancer, 9577 breast cancer, and 11,975 colorectal cancer during the follow-up period (2010–2014). An increase in PM10 of 
10 μg/m3 was associated with a 53% increase in relative risk (RR) of mouth and throat cancer and a 52% increase in RR 
of NMSC. Prostate and breast cancer were modestly associated with PM10 with an increase in RR of 23 and 19%, 
respectively. The associations with N02 were in the same direction as PM10 but the effect estimates were much lower 
(7–24%). A 10% increase in NDVI was most protective of mouth and throat cancer (− 11% RR) and of NMSC (− 16% RR). 
Colorectal cancer was not affected by any of the exposures. 
Conclusions: In addition to the studies carried out so far, this study was able to provide evidence that higher ambient 
AP levels increase the risk of mouth and throat cancer as well as of NMSC and that a higher residential green space 
level might have a protective effect for NMSC in areas with low to moderate UV intensity. Nevertheless, we cannot rule 
out residual confounding by socioeconomic or smoking status.

Background 
Outdoor air pollution (AP) is ubiquitous with its exposure 
having effects on a large proportion of the world popula- 
tion [1]. There is strong evidence from experimental and 
epidemiological studies that AP such as particulate matter 
(PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) are major 
risk factors for cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary dis- 
eases, and potentially cancer [2–9]. While the trigger func- 
tion of AP on cardiac and pulmonary events is considered 
as causal, the role in cancer onset is only suggestive. In 
the case of PM and cardiovascular mortality, there is a 
solid association that fulfils both a temporal and a close 
exposure-response relationship. There is coherence of 
results between several scientific disciplines, including 
experimental studies offering plausible biological mech- 
anisms reviewed in [3]. Both long-term and short-term 
effects are involved. An increase in PM2.5 long-term ex- 
posure per 10 μg/m3 increased the risk for cardiovascu- 
lar mortality by 11% in a recent meta-analysis [5]. Even 
a daily rise in mean PM2.5 level per 10 μg/m3 increased 
the risk for cardiovascular mortality by approximately 
0.4 to 1.0% [10]. In the case of cancer, it is much more 
difficult to prove causality. One reason is the long latency 
between exposure to carcinogens and the development of 
cancer. Another reason is that doses are typically low in 
the environment, and therefore direct causal inferences 
are hardly realized. Nevertheless, there is suggestive epi- 
demiological evidence that outdoor AP increases inci- 
dence rates of some cancer types with strongest evidence 
for lung cancer [11–19]. Molecular epidemiological stud- 
ies [20–22] have shown that the biological mechanisms 
causing cancer from outdoor AP involve genotoxic effects 
of the chemical compounds that accumulate over time, 
including PAH-DNA adducts, chromosome aberrations, 
sister chromatid exchanges, ras oncogene overexpression, 
and radically induced (oxidative) DNA damage. PM is 
listed as Group I carcinogen by the International 
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Sources of PM, 
other than household, are numerous including traffic, 
agricultural and industrial emissions as main anthropo- 
genic origins [23, 24]. We use PM10 (particles with aero- 
dynamic diameter of less than 10 μm) instead of PM2.5, 
because we have more variation in PM10 data. PM2.5 is far 
more evenly distributed throughout Saxony. We use 
NO2as marker for traffic-related AP to investigate the 
effect of urban agglomeration in Saxony on cancer inci- 
dence [25, 26]. We also want to narrow the research 
gap on the impact of green spaces on health, especially 
cancer. While numerous studies have analyzed associa- 
tions between AP and lung cancer, few studies have ad- 
dressed associations between green space and cancer 
incidence [27–30]. Green space is known to be in- 
versely related to AP due to lack of emission sources in 
[31]. Additionally, people residing in 
green places 
greener places might be more motivated to conduct 
physical activity [31], which is suggested to decrease 
cancer risk [32] through reductions of adipose tissue 
volume and endocrine activity (e.g. sex hormones) [33, 
34]. On the other hand, some studies have also re- 
ported adverse associations with green space that may 
be context-specific, like a negative effect on the human 
skin through increased sunlight exposure, while spend- 
ing time in green space [31]. Since a handful of studies 
have reported a link between lower all-cause mortality 
among people residing in green spaces [28, 35–37], it is 
a valid assumption that residential green space might 
decrease risk of some cancer types. 
The aim of the study was to analyze the association 
between residential exposure to PM10 and NO2 as well 
as green space on different cancer types. We restricted 
the analysis to those cancer types, which are less strongly 
associated with smoking as lung cancer is, but which 
might be affected by AP exposure either by inhalation or 
dermal route of exposure to PM10 particles and NO2. Fur- 
ther, we needed a sufficient number of cases to ensure that 
we have enough power for our analyses. Therefore, we 
had to use cancers that are frequent in the population. 
We identified mouth and throat cancer, non-melanoma 
skin cancer (NMSC) and colorectal cancer in both sexes, 
as well as prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in 
women, which fulfilled these requirements. At the begin- 
ning of the study, we also wanted to examine the effects of 
pesticides on various forms of cancer in addition to AP 
and green spaces. According to the literature [15, 16], 
glandular tissues like the prostate or the breast may be 
susceptible to some agricultural used pesticides (hormone 
disruptive agents). Unfortunately, the data situation was 
not sufficient and therefore this investigation was not con- 
tinued. Nevertheless, prostate and breast cancer were still 
used as outcomes. 
Methods 
AOK PLUS study population and case definitions 
In Germany, approximately 90% of the population is cov- 
ered by statutory health insurances. We used routine health 
care data from AOK PLUS, a large statutory health in- 
surance in Saxony (area ~ 18,000 km2, population ~ 4 
Mio), which covers almost half of the local general 
population. The data include information from in- 
patient and outpatient care with respect to diagnosis, 
procedures and prescriptions as well as socio-demographic 
information of the insured population such as age, sex and 
residential district (first four digits of the 5-digit postal 
code of the residential address). Age distribution and 
sex-ratio of the AOK PLUS beneficiaries in Saxony are 
comparable to the Germany-wide population [38]. We 
used data for the years 2007–2014 from the outpatient 
as well as from the inpatient sector. All beneficiaries 


were allocated to 186 four digit postal code districts 
based on their residential address in 2007. We excluded 
all cancer cases from the year 2007 for the determination 
of prevalent cases, because we had only outpatient data 
for this year. Further, beneficiaries that were diagnosed 
(outpatient or inpatient) in the years 2008 and 2009 
with one of the analyzed cancer types were excluded, to 
estimate incidence rates for the years 2010 until 2014 
(see Additional file 1: Figure S3). Age groups in incre- 
ments of 10 years were built based on the age of every 
beneficiary in the year 2012. Therefore, the newborns of 
the years 2013 and 2014 had to be excluded as well. Fur- 
ther, the ages from 0 to 49 years were collapsed to one 
group. See Table 1 for an exact partitioning of ages. 
In accordance with the Good epidemiological practice 
for secondary data analyses [39], cancer diseases were 
defined as one diagnosis of the corresponding ICD-10 
code (International Classification of Diseases) for the in- 
patient data, while two diagnoses in different quarters 
within one year were necessary for all outpatient data 
plus a prescription of a specific treatment (e.g. radiother- 
apy, cytostatic medication) or death within two quarters 
after the second diagnosis (see Additional file 2: Table S1, 
Additional file 3: Table S2, Additional file 4: Table S3). We 
used the codes C00-C14 for mouth and throat cancer, C44 
or L57.0 for NMSC, C61 for prostate cancer, C50 for breast 
cancer, and C18-C21 for colorectal cancer. 
Ethics approval and consent to participate 
The present analysis is based on secondary data from 
the health insurance company AOK PLUS, which were 
collected for the purpose of billing medical services. The 
study is supported by the AOK PLUS with which a data 
use and transfer agreement exists. The data was available 
for us only in anonymous form, so that no conclusions 
could be drawn about the individuals. Personal data of 
participants were anonymized through AOK PLUS be- 
fore data sharing. Personal identifiers were masked or 
deleted (clear name to pseudonym; no social security 
number provided). Quasi-identifiers were generalized (only 
year of birth used; dropping of last digit of the zip code). 
Unfortunately, the data are not publicly accessible. There 
was no influence whatsoever on the policyholders and 
no intervention was carried out. It is therefore a purely 
observational study. According to paragraph 75 SGB X 
(Zehntes Buch Sozialgesetzbuch - German federal law) 
it is not reasonable to get consent for data sharing and 
analysis from around 2 million people, like in our in- 
vestigation. Therefore, we submitted and get granted an 
application to the Saxon State Ministry for Social Af- 
fairs and Consumer Protection for obtaining consent to 
data transmission and analysis on behalf of the insured. 
This study was conducted in accordance with the 
Helsinki Declaration [40] and follows the principles of 
Good Epidemiological Practice and Good Practice in

Secondary Data Analysis [41]. The study was also regis-

under the number VfD_ECo_epi_16_003770. 
Air pollution and green space exposure assessment 
Annual NO2 and PM10 concentrations for the year 2007 
were derived from freely available maps in resolution of 
100 m developed for Western Europe [42]. These maps 
were created by land use regression models based on 
more than 1500 EuroAirnet monitoring sites. Predictor 
variables for land use regression models included land 
use characteristics, population density, road length, 
altitude, distance to sea, and satellite-derived NO2 and 
PM10 data [43]. 
Green spaces were defined by the Normalized Differ- 
ence Vegetation Index (NDVI), which was derived from 
freely available MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectrora- 
diometer (MODIS) satellite images at the resolution of 
250 m [44]. Briefly, NDVI is a commonly used indicator 
of vegetation level, ranging from − 1 (water) to + 1 (abso- 
lutely vegetated area). The algorithm for NDVI is based on 
two vegetation-informative bands: near-infrared (841 nm 
to 876 nm) and visible red (from 620 nm to 670 nm). For 
current analysis, we averaged 115 16-day composite NDVI 
images for the years 2005 to 2009 [45, 46]. 
These PM10, NO2, and NDVI estimates for 386 five 
digit postal codes were weighted by the population num- 
ber from the German census 2011 and then averaged to 
186 four digit postal code districts, because the address 
information were only available for the four digit postal 
codes due to privacy regulations. Freely available postal 
code vector data were obtained from postleitzahl.org. 
Geographic data management and calculations were 
conducted using the ArcGIS 10.1 Geographical Informa- 
tion System (GIS) (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) software 
program. 
Confounders/effect modifiers 
As control variables for the individual data analysis, age, 
sex, alcohol-related disorder, absolute number of physician 
contacts in the four digit postal code districts (AOK data) 
and the proportion of short- (up to one year) and long- 
term unemployment (more than 1 year; statistical office 
Saxony), ranging from 0 to 1, were considered. Addition- 
ally, for each four digit postal code district, population 
density per km2, all-cause mortality and proportion of per- 
sons with an alcohol-related disorder were considered in 
regression analysis on aggregated data. 
Alcohol-related disorder was defined as one inpatient 
F10 diagnosis without F10.0 (i. e. acute intoxication) or 
three F10 prescriptions within four quarters of a year in 
the outpatient sector and was used to adjust the models 
to correct for its influence on cancer incidence [47, 48]. 
Statistical analysis 
All the analyses were conducted with the program R, 
version 3.3.2 (Vienna, Austria) R Core Team [49], but 
data preprocessing was done with the software Stata 
(StataCorp. 2013. Stata Statistical Software: Release 13. 
College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). The individual asso- 
ciations between residential air pollutants, green space 
and cancer incidence rates were assessed by multilevel 
Poisson models with 95% confidence intervals with the 
R software package lme4. Due to the fact that not all in- 
dividuals were fully insured or alive in the five year-long 
study period (2010–2014), we used the exact observation 
time in days as offset in the models. Because of high corre- 
lations (Pearson correlations above |0.75|) between PM10, 
NO2, and NDVI, associations with each exposure were an- 
alyzed individually (see Additional file 5: Figure S1). 
For the aggregated data, cancer incidence rates of the 
186 four digit postal codes were age-standardized by the 
European standard population [50] and adjusted for meas- 
urement errors due to the limited observation period 
using conditional autoregressive models (CAR), which use 
the first order spatial dependencies (shared borders) with 
the software BayesX for R [51, 52]. These associations 
were analyzed with linear models. 
We used the best subset approach according to the low- 
est Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for variable se- 
lection, implemented in the R package glmulti [53], to 
filter out unassociated variables for each model (adjusted 
models). We computed crude and adjusted models for each 
outcome and exposure pair (Additional file 6: Table S5). 
We conducted a sensitivity analysis for the influence 
of the change of residence on the effect estimates by 
exclusion of movers and by comparing these results 
with the primary analysis where both, movers and non-- 
movers, were included (Additional file 7: Table S4). 
Results 
Baseline characteristics of the study population 
Of more than 1.9 million initially cancer-free persons in- 
cluded into the analysis (Table 1), 3107 people developed 
mouth and throat cancer, 33,178 NMSC, 9611 prostate 
cancer, 9577 breast cancer, and 11,975 colorectal cancer 
during the follow-up period (2010–2014). Although there 
were slightly more females in the total population (53%), 
more males were affected by mouth and throat (74 vs. 
26%) and colorectal cancer (53 vs. 47%), respectively. The 
number of incident cancer cases increased with age as 
expected, but decreased for the oldest age-groups (80–89, 
90+). Mean age for developing cancer of interest ranged 
from 65 to 76 years. In the mouth and throat cancer sub- 
group, the proportion of people with an alcohol-related 
disorder reached almost 36%. Altogether, 69,722 people 
had a prevalent alcohol-related disorder (~ 3.6% from 
total) and 302,818 people (~ 15.8% from total) changed 


their place of residence between different four digit 
postal code districts at least once within the study 
period. 
Air pollution and green space 
PM10 and NO2 levels were differentially distributed over 
the 186 four digit postal code districts in Saxony (Fig. 1). 
While NO2 showed highest concentrations in agglomer- 
ation areas with high population density (cities Dresden, 
Leipzig, Chemnitz, and Zwickau), PM10 was much smoother 
distributed, even in rural areas, with highest concentrations 
in the north-west part of Saxony around Leipzig and in 
Middle Saxony to Dresden. Lowest concentrations of PM10 
were observed in the Erzgebirge region in the south-west of 
Saxony. On the contrary, green space, as defined by NDVI, 
was higher in rural areas and the lowest in the metropolitan 
areas of Leipzig, Dresden, Chemnitz, and Görlitz and 
their vicinities. PM10 concentrations ranged from 15.47 
to 26.30 μg/m3 (mean: 20.89), NO2 concentrations 
ranged from 9.32 to 31.55 μg/m3 (mean: 20.44), and 
NDVI varied between 0.38 and 0.64 (mean: 0.51). The 
admissible annual averages for PM10 and NO2 in accordance 
Fig. 1 Exposure and Case maps; Mean concentrations of the exposures PM10 and NO2 (μg/m3) and mean NDVI (0 to + 1) are shown. Case maps 
of specific cancer types in Saxony, population density and mean physician contacts per year over the years 2010 until 2014 (data source: AOK PLUS) 
are given. Age-standardized cancer incidences (per 100.000 persons) were smoothed using a Bayesian CAR model 


with the Federal Immission Control Act (39. BImSchV) and 
the European Directive on Air Quality (2008/50/EG) are 
40 μg/m3 each. 
Additional file 5: Figure S1 shows Pearson correlation 
coefficients for associations between AP and NDVI, as 
well as physician contacts (PC). Most correlations were at 
least 75%, except for NDVI and PC (~ − 58%) or NO2 and 
PC (~ 61%). 
Association between air pollution, green space, and cancer 
incidence 
Semi-individual data modeling 
An increase in PM10 of 10 μg/m3 was associated with a 
53% increase in relative risk (RR) of mouth and throat 
cancer and a 52% increase in RR of NMSC (Table 2). 
Prostate and breast cancer were modestly associated 
with PM10 with an increase in RR of 23 and 19%, re- 
spectively. The associations with N02 were in the same 
direction as PM10 but the effect estimates were much 
weaker (7–24%) and did not reach statistical significance 
for prostate cancer. An increase in NDVI by 10% re- 
vealed associations with mouth and throat cancer with 
an 11% decrease in RR and with NMSC with a 16% de- 
crease in RR. No associations were found for prostate or 
breast cancer and NDVI. Colorectal cancer was not af- 
fected by any of the exposures (Table 2). 
Alcohol-related disorder was associated with a more 
than 9 times increased risk of mouth and throat cancer 
a 50% increase of colorectal cancer and a 22% increase 
of breast cancer. Men were also more affected by any of 
the cancers which occur in both sexes (RR 1.6 to 2.7×; 
Table 2). 
When only the people who did not change the place 
of residence were considered, similar results were observed 
except for the effect of PM10 on mouth and throat cancer 
which increased by 8% (Additional file 7: Table S4). 
Aggregated data analysis 
Cancer incidence rates generally showed a scattered dis- 
tribution over Saxony (Fig. 1). The range of differences 
between the four digit postal code districts was small for 
colorectal cancer (86 to 94 cases per 100.000 insured 
persons) and breast cancer (144 to 158 cases per 100.000 
insured persons), but high for mouth and throat cancer 
(22 to 36 cases), prostate cancer (140 to 240 cases), and 
especially for NMSC (150 to 400 cases). High correlation 
of physician contacts with PM10 (~ 75%) prevented using 
this variable of personal demand as a confounder in the 
adjusted models. 
Crude linear regression analyses showed associations 
between PM10 and mouth and throat cancer (R2 0.203) 
or NMSC (R2 0.144). Associations with breast- or pros- 
tate cancer were weak (Fig. 2). NO2 was associated with 
NMSC (R2 0.164), but asssociations with breast-, and pros- 
tate cancer, or colorectal cancer were weak (Additional file 8: 
Figure S2 and Additional file 6: Table S5 in supplement). 
Moderate negative correlations were observed for NDVI 
and mouth and throat cancer (R2 0.114) or NMSC 
(R2 0.137), but again, the association with prostate 
cancer was weak (Additional 
file 8: Figure S2 and 
Additional file 6: Table S5). 


Adjusted linear regression models were in the same 
direction as the crude analysis. Also PM10 and mouth 
and throat cancer (R2 0.331) or NMSC (R2 0.258) showed 
associations, but effect estimates were lower compared to 
file 6: Table S5). 
(Additional 
the 
NO2showed also some association with NMSC (R2 
0.259) in the adjusted analysis, while associations to 
prostate-, breast-, and colorectal cancer remained weak. 
Negative correlations between NDVI and mouth and 
throat cancer (R2 0.275) or NMSC (R2 0.250) were still 
present in the adjusted analysis, but again, effect esti- 
mates were lower than in the crude models.

Discussion 
To the best of our knowledge, this study is novel and sub- 
stantially adds to the current knowledge, because first of 
all the modeling is based on a very large cohort (1.9 
million beneficiaries), which is needed to study associations 
between environmental exposures and cancer incidence. 
While earlier work has exclusively focused on the associ- 
ation between AP and lung cancer [1, 12–19, 54–56], we 
observed that PM10 is also related to mouth and throat 
cancer, NMSC, and maybe also to prostate and breast can- 
cer. It is not so surprising that other types of cancer such 
as mouth and throat cancer or NMSC are also associated 
with AP, since chemical compounds are inhaled from 
the tidal air or even passed through the skin into the 
human body and accumulate there in the respective tis- 
sue over time. Some of these compounds could induce 
different forms of DNA damage [20–22], which could 
lead to tumor development. On the other hand, no as- 
sociation was found with colorectal cancer. Perhaps the 
carcinogens of the ambient air cannot accumulate in 
the intestine as they are already stopped by the lung or 
skin tissue beforehand. Associations between cancer in- 
cidence and green space (NDVI) or NO2 were present, 
but much smaller than for PM10. 
We speculate that the high regional variation in NMSC 
(Fig. 1) could be due to differences in health care 
utilization in the population, whereas this is unlikely 
for more severe cancer types. One Australian study 


reported a higher skin cancer risk for regions with more 
vegetation [27], but exposure to UV light is certainly sig- 
nificantly greater in Australia compared to our study set- 
ting. Our results indicate that green space might be 
protective against NMSC in Germany. This observed pro- 
tective effect might be secondary as the distribution of 
green spaces and PM10 were highly inversely correlated, 
and, as aforementioned, there are fewer emission sites 
around green spaces [31]. Thus, in areas where the UV in- 
tensity is much weaker than in Australia like in Germany, 
residential green space could lower the skin cancer risk. 
However, more studies are needed to clarify whether res- 
iding in greener places is beneficial or detrimental for 
NMSC and if this effect is causal or only indirectly trans- 
mitted through a lack of AP at these sites. 
In the age group 18 until 64 years 5.0% of the sample 
population had an alcohol-related disorder. Survey data 
from 2012 for Germany and this age group found 3.1% 
with alcohol abuse and additionally 3.4% with alcohol 
dependency according to DSM IV. Our 5.0% estimate 
lies between 3.1 and 6.5% [57]. We expect therefore, that 
not all cases of alcohol abuse or dependency have already 
been recognized by physicians, but yet we consider it a 
valuable confounding variable. Further, a recent meta-ana- 
lysis [58] and other studies [48, 59] found positive associa- 
tions with high alcohol consumption on colorectal, mouth 
and throat, as well as breast cancer, and limited evidence 
for prostate cancer. Our effect estimate of alcohol on 
mouth and throat cancer is possibly a bit overestimated, 
as part of the people with an alcohol-related disorder are 
also smokers and these risk factors interact with each 
other [59]. 
We speculate that the high correlation of physician 
contacts and PM10 (~ 75%) suggests that PM10 is a 
wide-ranging risk factor for many diseases and therefore 
reducing it should be a central focus for community 
health. 
Strength and limitations 
One of the strengths of the presented analysis is that the 
dataset contains a huge population. The population covers 
almost half of the residential population of Saxony and is 
regarding age and sex distribution very similar to the gen- 
eral population of Saxony, which allows us to investigate 
cancer incidence for the federal state of Saxony. Further, 
the study offers complete information about out- and 
inpatient treatments and is not affected by sampling or 
nonresponse bias. Selection bias because of changes of 
the health insurance due to the cancer disease is also 
unlikely, since no differences in cancer treatment between 
statutory health insurances are present in Germany. 
We have invested a lot of work in exact case definitions 
and can therefore build our analyses on valid cancer 
diagnoses. 
Nevertheless, several important limitations should be 
acknowledged. Address information up to four digit 
postal code districts was available, which did not allow 
a high spatial resolution of individual outcome and ex- 
posure assessments. Therefore, we could only use the 
exposure of the four digit postal code district as a sur- 
rogate for the individual exposure (semi-individual). 
Additional information on some potentially important in- 
dividual confounders, such as smoking, socioeconomic 
status, diet, or physical activity was unfortunately not 
available, which could have led to residual confounding. 
Further confounding could occur due to genetic predis- 
position of patients for certain cancer types, or due to 
other environmental pollutants, like pesticides. But farm 
workers, with a potential high exposition with pesticides, 
are not included in our data set, since they have their own 
statutory health insurance in Germany. Unfortunately, we 
had no information about occupation, indoor radon ex- 
posure of patients and virus infections possible related to 
cancer which could also confound our analyses. 
The observed associations could therefore be overesti- 
mated or be biased due to exposure misclassification, for 
example, but the magnitude should not be too high. In 
one study on lung cancer, the hazard ratio of PM10 de- 
creased by only 11% if it was additionally controlled for 
smoking status, smoking intensity, square of smoking in- 
tensity, smoking duration, time since quitting smoking, 
environmental tobacco smoke, occupation, fruit intake, 
marital status, education level, and employment status 
[54]. Our models assumed that the residential popula- 
tion did not move and AP was constant over time. Both 
assumptions, especially the first, are unlikely. Neverthe- 
less, it is reassuring that our findings remained robust, 
when analyzing only the population that did not move 
outside their four digit postal code district during the 
observation period. Still, it is unknown what their move- 
ment history was until 2007. From the literature it is 
known that migrants have better health because people 
with low socioeconomic status or severe diseases are less 
mobile [60]. This could bias our results and therefore, 
we trust our primary analysis more than the results of 
the sensitivity analysis with excluded migrants. 
Conclusions 
Beyond the current study situation we found some evidence 
that higher ambient AP levels increase the risk of mouth 
and throat cancer and of NMSC, while a higher residential 
green space level might have a protective effect. In sum- 
mary, we assume that our effect estimates are not strongly 
biased by residual confounding, but we cannot exclude that 
for sure. Further research should try to measure the envir- 
onmental exposures through the life course and focus on 
the effects of relocation together with environmental factors 
and extent the analyses to other cancer types.
