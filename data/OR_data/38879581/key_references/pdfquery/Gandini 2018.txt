Background: The LIFE MED HISS project aims at setting up a surveillance system on the long term effects of air 
pollution on health, using data from National Health Interview Surveys and other currently available sources of 
information in most European countries. Few studies assessed the long term effect of air pollution on hospital 
admissions in European cohorts. 
Objective: The objective of this paper is to estimate the long term effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on first-ever (incident) cause-specific hospitalizations in Italy. 
Methods: We used data from the Italian Longitudinal Study (ILS), a cohort study based on the 1999–2000 
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), followed up for hospitalization (2001–2008) at individual level. The 
survey contains information on crucial potential confounders: occupational/educational/marital status, body 
mass index (BMI), smoking habit and physical activity. 
Annual mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was assigned starting from simulated gridded data at spatial re- 
solution of 4 × 4 km2 firstly integrated with data from monitoring stations and then up-scaled at municipality 
level. 
Statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models with robust variance estimator. 
Results: For each cause of hospitalization we estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for confounders with 
95% Confidence Interval (CI) related to a 10 μg/m3 increase in pollutants. For PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, we 
found positive associations for circulatory system diseases [1.05(1.03–1.06); 1.05(1.03–1.07)], myocardial in- 
farction [1.15(1.12–1.18); 1.15(1.12–1.18)], lung cancer [1.18(1.10–1.26); 1.20(1.12–1.28)], kidney cancer 
[1.24(1.11–1.29); 1.20(1.07–1.33)], all cancers (but 
lung) [1.06(1.04–1.08); 1.06(1.04–1.08)] and Low 
Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) [1.07 (1.04–1.11); 1.05 (1.02–1.08)]. 
Discussion: Our results add new evidence on the effects of air pollution on first-ever (incident) hospitalizations, 
both in urban and rural areas. We demonstrated the feasibility of a low-cost monitoring system based on 
available data.

The association between the exposure to major airborne pollutants 
and several long term adverse effects on mortality has been well 
documented (Hoek et al., 2013) but relatively few studies focused on 
the long term effects of particulate (PM10 and PM2.5) or NO2 on hos- 
pital admissions. Available studies have investigated the association 
between airborne pollution and some specific causes of hospitaliza- 
tions: acute coronary events (Cesaroni et al., 2014), stroke (Andersen 
et al., 2012a; Kloog et al., 2012; Alimohammadi et al., 2016), asthma 
(Andersen et al., 2012a), respiratory illness or specifically Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Hruba et al., 2001; Andersen 
et al., 2011; Kloog et al., 2012; Atkinson et al., 2015), cerebrovascular 
diseases (Stafoggia et al., 2014; Kloog et al., 2012; Oudin et al., 2010), 
neurodegenerative diseases (Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2016) and dia- 
betes (Kloog et al., 2012; Andersen et al., 2012b). These studies were 
mostly carried out in USA, where both the characteristics and sus- 
ceptibility of the population exposed and the composition of air pol- 
lution mixture can be different from European context. Several cohorts 
are available in Europe, as the national English cohort (812,063 pa- 
tients aged 40–89 years as reported by Atkinson et al., 2015), the 
Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health (DCH) cohort (57,053 people from 
Copenhagen or Aarhus aged 50–65 years, as reported by Andersen 
et al., 2012a) or the London cohort, which studied also combined ef- 
fects of noise and air pollution (Halonen et al., 2015). 
Earlier studies on long term effect had limitations on the exposure 
assessment, due to the lack of air quality monitoring networks able to 
represent large areas or countries, which led to study only restricted 
areas. In recent years, the quality of the exposure assessment has been 
improved, using prediction models for exposure which combine land 
use regression with physical measurements or using atmospheric 
Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) and satellite data. With these new 
techniques it is possible to investigate both long and short term effects 
on adverse health effect on wide areas; an example is the study of Kloog 
et al. (2012) and (2015) which investigated the effects of pollutants on 
hospital admissions across New-England or Cesaroni et al. (2013) for 
mortality. However, even though a large amount of population is in- 
volved in these studies, they are usually based on available health data 
from registers or on ecological data, with a consequent approximation 
in the control for individual potential confounders, such as diet, socio- 
economic variables, physical activity, etc. For some of the investigated 
diseases, the debate on the real role played by the air pollutants on 
hospital admissions incidence is still ongoing: for COPD, an acute event, 
as the primary outcome, it cannot be unambiguously distinguished the 
role of air pollution in exacerbating COPD (developed due to other 
causes) from its etiological contribution to the development of COPD 
(Schikowski et al., 2014). Papers mentioned that asthma hospitalization 
could be a bad marker of asthma onset and thus could underrate the 
real asthma burden, with only a fraction of asthma patients hospitalized 
(Andersen et al., 2012a). For diabetes, an accurate and large study 
concluded that the risk for diabetes was only weakly associated with 
increasing mean levels of traffic-related air pollution, with indication of 
interaction, while the risks were higher in nonsmokers and physically 
active people (Andersen et al., 2012c). 
The LIFE MED HISS project (LIFE MED HISS, 2013) is a pilot study 
aimed at estimating long-term effects of air pollution in four European 
Mediterranean countries (Italy, France, Slovenia and Spain), using al- 
ready available or potentially available cohorts. These are based on the 
follow-up from the NHISs, a solution that offers wide information on 
almost all potential confounders needed. The aim of the project is to 
demonstrate the feasibility of this new approach and its possible ap- 
plication in other EU countries, since all perform regularly health in- 
terview and examination surveys (Hupkens et al., 1999). The approach 
is based on the linkage of individual survey's data, with mortality and 
hospitalization outcomes, where privacy regulations permit it, and with 
exposure data at the place of residence derived from national air 

pollution models. In countries where linkage was not possible because 
of privacy policy restrictions, the MED HISS project tested an ecological 
approach (Basagaña, 2015; de Keijzer et al., 2016). In both approaches, 
exposure to air pollution has been assigned using data coming from 
CTMs, where accuracy has been improved with monitoring station data 
by means of data fusion techniques (Gandini et al., 2016; Ghigo et al., 
2017). 
In this paper we present the results of MED HISS approach in Italy, 
where no privacy policy restrictions have arisen and linkage between 
survey's data and hospitalization outcomes has been possible. We used 
the data of the ILS, a cohort based on the NHIS followed up for mor- 
tality and hospitalization, and we evaluated the long term effects on 
hospital admissions related to air pollution exposure in the sample 
living in all the Italian national territory, covering both urban and rural 
areas. We studied the association between air pollution concentrations 
at municipal level and the risk of first-ever (incident) hospital admis- 
sion for several causes, controlling for main individual confounders, 
including lifestyle and socioeconomic information. The use of first-ever 
hospitalization allows to approximate a measure of incidence of pa- 
thology. All results are stratified by gender and level of urbanization. 
Thanks to the nature of the ILS, we were able to analyze a wide list of 
causes, adding knowledge where few studies were available (like e.g. 
atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction). 


The ILS is a follow-up study based on the sample included in the 
1999–2000 NHIS, carried out by the National Institute of Statistics, 
linked to mortality and hospital records (Marinacci et al., 2013). The 
original NHIS sample consists of 140,011 individuals belonging to 
52,232 sampled families resident in 1449 municipalities in the whole 
national territory (Fig. 1). The NHIS contains, beside others, individual 
information on age, gender, occupational and educational status, 
marital status, residence, BMI, smoking habit and physical activity. 
Information on alcohol was not available in the survey, while in- 
formation on diet was limited to particular conditions (e.g. macrobiotic 
diet) and therefore could not be used to assess lifestyles. Concerning 
residence, we had no information about home address due to privacy 
restrictions and we could only know the municipality of residence for 
each individual. 
Due to the nature of the LIFE MED HISS project, variables included 
in the model are harmonized, according to the standard developed 
within the European EUROTHINE project (EUROTHINE 2005), en- 
suring a high degree of comparability with other European surveys, also 
considering levels chosen for categorical variables. 
An individual record-linkage procedure was applied to the 128,818 
individuals with complete personal data and giving consensus to be 
followed-up (92% of the total sample). Follow up for hospital admis- 
sions in this paper covers the period 2001–2008. Analyses on associa- 
tion between air pollution and adverse health effects are conducted on 
74,989 individuals (belonging to 45,418 sampled families resident in 
1442 municipalities) aged > 35 years and alive at 2001: in this sub- 
cohort, 41,047 individuals experienced at least one hospital admission. 
We excluded non-accidental causes and repeated hospitalizations for 
the same subject (with the exceptions of myocardial infarction, angina 
pectoris and LRTI). 
For each cause, we considered only the main cause of hospitaliza- 
tion out of six available, and, for each subject, only the first hospital 
admission, excluding all subsequent hospitalization for the same cause. 
This criterion permits to have a good approximation to an incidence 
measure. An exception to this rule was done for diabetes and COPD, 
which were searched among all six codes. A second type of exception 
was done for myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and LRTI: for the 
first two causes, a second event that occurred after 28 days or more 




from the first episode was considered as a new event (Thygensen et al., 
2012), whereas for LRTI the time elapsed from the first episode to 
consider it as a new event had to be 90 days or more. 
We selected the following main group of causes: disease of the cir- 
culatory system (ICD-9 code 390–459), heart diseases (ICD-9 code 
390–429), cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-9 code 430–438), diseases of 
the respiratory system (ICD-9 code 460–519), all neoplasm but lung 
cancer (ICD-9 code 140–239, with the exception of 162), mental, be- 
havioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (ICD-9 code 290–319), 
diseases of the nervous system (ICD-9 code 320–359). 
Moreover, we investigated the following specific causes: lung cancer 
(ICD-9 code 162), bladder cancer (ICD-9 code 188), kidney cancer (ICD- 
9 code 189), diabetes (ICD-9 code 250), Parkinson's disease (ICD-9 code 
332), Alzheimer's disease (ICD-9 code 331), myocardial infarction (ICD- 
9 code 410), angina pectoris (ICD-9 code 413) atherosclerosis (ICD-9 
code 440), LRTI (ICD-9 code 466, 480–487), chronic obstructive pul- 
monary disease (COPD) (ICD-9 code 490–492, 494, 496), asthma (ICD- 
9 code 493), and miscarriage (ICD-9 code 634). 

The Italian exposure model takes into account data coming from the 
modeling system MINNI (National Integrated Modelling system for 
International Negotiation on atmospheric pollution), developed and 
validated by ENEA and the Italian Ministry of the Environment Land 
and Sea (Mircea et al., 2014; Mircea et al., 2016). MINNI includes an 
atmospheric chemical transport model (CTM) fed by emission data 
(national emission inventory of anthropogenic sources, biogenic VOCs, 
sea-salt, natural dust) and meteorological prognostic fields. MINNI 
outputs for PM2.5 and NO2 were provided for years 1999, 2003, 2005 
and 2007 at a spatial resolution representative of urban background 
pollution levels (4 × 4 km2) at hourly resolution (Mircea et al., 2014). 
The CTM model included in the MINNI modeling system is called FARM 
(Gariazzo et al., 2007; Silibello et al., 2008) and the version used in the 
study is the 3.1.12. 
In order to reduce model uncertainty, a data fusion technique is 
and pollutant 



observations. Thus, 
it is possible to provide a more realistic re- 
presentation of pollutant spatial distribution. Therefore, a Kriging with 
External Drift (KED, Van de Kassteele et al., 2009; Ignaccolo et al., 
2013) procedure has been used to account for the observed data into 
MINNI fields. Specifically, the kriging is applied on the observed data 
and the external drift is constituted by the MINNI model output. Ob- 
servations were interpreted as realizations of a Gaussian spatial process 
Y(s) at spatial location s, in the domain S. Y(s) has the following 
structure: 
where in the trend component μ(s) the MINNI model output is in- 
troduced, w(s) is a stationary Gaussian random process and ε(s) is the 
error term. Regarding observed data introduced in the dispersion model 
outputs, we retrieved data from other Italian regional environmental 
agencies out of BRACE database (national system: http://www.brace. 
sinanet.apat.it/). Only background stations, whose spatial representa- 
tiveness is consistent with the MINNI resolution, and only monitoring 
sites with > 80% of data have been considered and averaged to obtain 
annual observed values (Ghigo et al., 2017). 
PM2.5 and NO2 are the most impacting pollutants on the Italian 
territory, in terms of long-term effect on human health. Also SO2 and 
CO have historically been of high impact, but their airborne levels have 
been drastically reduced before year 2000, therefore their impact is 
very low in the time span analyzed in this study. Black carbon was 
included in official EU emission inventories in 2017, so no national 
emission data were available at the time of this study. 
Since the health data from the NHIS are aggregated at the municipal 
level, the exposure assessment has to rely on the same spatial scale. 
Therefore, following this data fusion approach, the Italian exposure 
assessment was carried out by up-scaling the gridded data at the mu- 
nicipality level (Ignaccolo et al., 2013). These annual exposure maps 
were obtained overlying gridded concentration data to municipality 
boundaries and then using a weighted average, where built-up area 
percentages were the weights. Built-up area information has been col- 
lected from Corine Land Cover data (CORINE, 2006) using land use 
classes belonging to Artificial Surfaces categories. In this way, for both

nicipalities (Fig. 1). 
modifier. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare the models with 
and without interaction terms. 

For each of the analyzed outcomes, the individual effect of long- 
term exposure to air pollution on hospitalization is modelled using the 
Cox proportional hazard model, with air pollution levels and age class 
as time-varying variables, while adjusting for other variables. Robust 
variance estimates are produced to take into account the two-stage 
sampling strategy used by ISTAT (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica) in the 
survey (sampling municipalities at the first stage and households within 
each municipality at the second stage, and enrolling all the individuals 
of the sampled families). 
We estimate hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for gender, educational 
level (classified according to the international classification ISCED and 
grouped into the four classes: up to primary, corresponding to ISCED 
0–1, lower secondary, ISCED 2 and 3C, upper secondary, ISCED 3A and 3B 
and post secondary, ISCED 4–6), marital status (living with partner/not 
living with partner), occupational status (employed/not employed), 
smoking habit (current smoker, former smoker, never smoker), physical 
activity (4 different levels combining information on type and fre- 
quency of activity) and BMI. The individual characteristics are known 
only at the time of the interview. For each subject we define the re- 
sidence based on type of municipality according to the population size: 
metropolitan areas (municipalities with > 250,000 inhabitants), urban 
areas (between 20,000 and 250,000 inhabitants) and rural areas (mu- 
nicipalities with < 20,000 inhabitants). 
The idea of LIFE MED HISS project is to obtain the maximum in- 
formation from sources already available. Since we had four years of air 
pollution exposure (from 1999 to 2007), which were subsequent to the 
enrollment of the cohort, we did not find appropriate to use air pollu- 
tion as time-dependent variable using only the most recent year of 
exposure, as done in other studies (Nafstad et al., 2004). Therefore, we 
divided the follow-up period in 4 risk sets and computed the annual 
exposure value of each risk set as the mean exposure of all the pre- 
ceding years for which the data was available, as follows: 
• 1999–2002 (exposure in 1999) 
• 2003–2004 (mean exposure of 1999 and 2003) 
• 2005–2006 (mean exposure of 1999, 2003 and 2005) 
• 2007–2008 (mean exposure of 1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007) 


Due to the nature of data and consequently of the exposure as- 
sessment, which assigns one single value over the whole city, the results 
are presented also by municipality size population, according to the 
residence, for rural, urban and metropolitan areas. 
The proportional hazard assumption was tested for all the fixed 
predictors and stratified Cox models were applied for predictors that 
did not meet the assumption. 
For each outcome, we evaluated potential effect modification by 
adding into the model the proper interaction term of exposure by 
Due to the heterogeneous spatial coverage of monitoring stations in 
Northern and Central Italy (dense spatial coverage) and Southern Italy 
(sparse spatial coverage), sensitivity analyses are also presented re- 
stricted to the first domain. 



Analyses on association between air pollution and hospital admis- 
sions are performed on 74,989 individuals aged > 35 years and alive 
at 2001. 
Table 1 shows the distribution of sample characteristics, overall and 
stratified by size of the municipality of residence. Due to space con- 
straints, pollutants are described only in 2005, but distributions do not 
change substantially in the other years. 
Most individuals live in rural areas (60.6%), while only 8.4% of the 
population is resident in the twelve metropolitan cities with > 250,000 
inhabitants (Rome, Milan, Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna, 
Florence, Bari, Catania, Venice and Verona). In our cohort, 70.2% is be- 
tween 35 and 65 years, with 2.8% of people aged over 85; 46.8% is normal 
weight and 11.9% is obese, with 0.2% with severe obesity. Most families are 
composed by person living with a partner (83.3%). Concerning physical 
activity, 46.7% is totally inactive. Educational level is categorized according 
to ISCED, with the highest percentage (46.6%) belonging to ISCED 0–1 (low 
education level), mainly concentrated in rural areas. Variables included in 
the analyses are compiled for all individuals. Mean and standard deviation 
of PM2.5 and NO2 in 2005 are also shown in Table 1: the distribution of the 
pollutants looks invariant to each category of all the variables included in 
the analysis. If we consider only year 2005 for exposure, 76.3% and 79.1% 
of the individuals are exposed to concentration ranging between 10 and 
30 μg/m3, for NO2 and PM2.5 respectively (Table 2). 
Table 3 shows HRs with 95% CI of cause-specific hospitalization 
for 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and NO2. For PM2.5 and NO2, 
respectively, we found positive associations for circulatory system 
diseases [1.05(1.03–1.06); 1.05(1.03–1.07)], myocardial 
infarction 
[1.15(1.12–1.18); 1.15(1.12–1.18)], 
lung cancer [1.18(1.10–1.26); 
1.20(1.12–1.28)], kidney cancer [1.24(1.11–1.29); 1.20(1.07–1.33)], 
neoplasms (lung cancer excluded) [1.06(1.04–1.08); 1.06(1.04–1.08)] 
and LRTI [1.10 (1.04–1.15); 1.05 (1.01–1.10)]. Significant associations 
is also found with NO2, and hospital admissions for atherosclerosis 
[1.10(1.03–1.17)]. We found negative associations for hospital admis- 
sions related to COPD [0.90(0.86–0.94); 0.94(0.90–0.97) for PM2.5 and 
NO2 respectively]. 
Table 4 shows results stratified, for rural areas, urban areas and 
metropolitan areas. When main results are reported by municipalities' 
population size, metropolitan areas do not show significant results for 
most of causes. 
Results stratified by gender are reported in Table 5. The risk of both 
lung, kidney and urinary cancer is higher in women than in men for 
both the air pollutants, on the contrary the effects of PM2.5 and NO2 are 
the same for neoplasm (lung cancer excluded) hospitalization.

Focusing on lung cancer (Table 6), HRs are higher and robust even 
among non-smokers and former smokers [1.17 (1.04–1.31) and 1.16 
(1.04–1.29) for PM2.5 and NO2 for non-smokers; 1.16 (0.99–1.35) and 
1.19 (1.03–1.38) for PM2.5 and NO2 for former smokers]. Risks are also 
higher among sedentary people or who practice light physical activity, 
with about 20% excess of risk in both categories and for both pollu- 
tants. Considering BMI as a categorical variable, also obese and over- 
weight people show higher HRs. 
Since in the Southern part of Italy the spatial coverage of monitoring 
stations is lower, with potentially less accurate exposure assessment, a 
sensitivity analysis has been performed restricted to the northern and 
central regions of Italy. Considering overall results (reported in Table 
S1 of supplemental material), risks for hospital admissions for circula- 
tory diseases are lower (respectively 1.03 (1.01–1.05) and 1.03 
(1.01–1.05) for PM2.5 and NO2), whereas risk estimates for asthma 
causes are higher [respectively 1.26 (1.06–1.50) and 1.27 (1.02–1.58) 
for PM2.5 and NO2]. 
Sensitivity analyses have been performed also assigning to each 
subject only the year 2005 for exposure (Table S2 in supplemental 
material) in which spatial coverage of monitoring stations is robust also 
for PM2.5. HRs are similar to those estimated with time-dependent 
exposure assessment (1999–2007), only slightly attenuated for NO2 and 
amplified for PM2.5. 

In this study we investigated the long term effect of air pollution on 
a wide series of causes of hospitalization using the follow-up of the 
1999–2000 Italian Health Interview Survey. 
PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with an increased risk of hospita- 
lization for cardiovascular diseases (in particular myocardial infarc- 
tion), cancer (with a stronger effect for lung and kidney cancer), LRTI 
and nervous system diseases. 
The proposed low-cost approach, suitable for surveillance, is based 
on linking resources like air pollution prediction models, mortality and 
hospital admissions registries and National Health Interview Surveys, 
the latter being already available and mandatory in all European 
countries. This record linkage has permitted the investigation of the 
impact of air pollution on a European cohort in the Mediterranean area. 
A peculiarity of this cohort is the availability of individual information, 
which naturally arises from the questionnaire. This allows controlling 
for individual potential confounders; besides, the NHIS contains a 
sample representative of the population spread in the whole national 
territory, covering both urban and rural areas. Thanks to the CTMs, the 
problem of having a limited number of PM2.5 monitors is overcome. 
MINNI system covers the whole national territory providing a measure 
of exposure for each municipality, including also rural and suburban 
populations which are far from monitoring stations. 
As expected, a clear effect was seen for lung cancer hospital ad- 
missions. The focus on lung cancer confirms literature findings, en- 
suring the robustness of the use of the NHISs for epidemiological pur- 
poses in environmental field (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2011). The use of 
information on individual behaviours allowed showing risks for some 
categories: non-smokers experience the known risks, subject that do not 
perform physical activity and/or overweight or obese experience the 
highest risks. 
However, the employment of land use regression models, as well as 
more detailed personal exposure assessment, which can include vari- 
ables like distance from major roads (see for example Hystad et al., 
2013), could be recommended to ensure more robust results in me- 
tropolitan areas, when more detailed information about home address 
is not limited by privacy regulation. 
Significant risks are also seen considering all neoplasms, even ex- 
cluding the contribution of lung cancer. Results also suggest a re- 
lationship between air pollution exposure and kidney cancer, indicating 
the potential effect of air pollutants on tissues more exposed to che- 
micals, also for their de-toxifying function. 
Results obtained for circulatory diseases (both for PM2.5 and NO2) 
confirm the putative biological mechanisms linking long term exposure 
to air pollution and cardiovascular diseases, which involves direct ef- 
fects of pollutants on the cardiovascular system, blood, and lung re- 
ceptors, and/or indirect effects mediated through pulmonary oxidative 
stress and inflammatory responses (Kloog et al., 2012). Risks are sta- 
tistically significant also stratified by gender and by level of munici- 
pality population size. Results are substantially confirmed (with the 
exception of asthma) when restricted to the Northern and Central part 
of Italy, where the spatial coverage of monitoring stations is higher and 
improves CTMs data.

Results obtained for atherosclerosis (particularly for NO2) confirm 
recent findings of coronary artery calcification within six metropolitan 
areas in the USA (Kaufman et al., 2016) and the results of ESCAPE on a 
preclinical marker of atherosclerosis (intima-media thickness of the 
common carotid artery) (Perez et al., 2015). Increased concentrations 
of PM2.5 and traffic-related air pollution within metropolitan areas are 
associated with progression in coronary calcification, consistent with 
acceleration of atherosclerosis. Considering myocardial infarction, few 
studies are available in the literature until now, whereas many studies 
focus on short-term effect (Bhaskaran et al., 2009). Our study supports 
the evidence of an effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on 
myocardial infarction. 
It is known that the biological mechanisms linking long term ex- 
posure to air pollution and respiratory diseases include reduced lung 
function, pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress. 
Nevertheless, in our study no results are obtained for the whole 
group of respiratory diseases. If we investigate more specific causes of 
hospitalization, we see a clear effect of air pollution on LRTI and a 
suggestion on relationship with asthma, with all the known limitations 
to this type of hospital admissions. Risks for COPD are still an open 
issue with controversial results (Atkinson et al., 2015), while a causal 
role of air pollution in the induction of COPD would be biologically 
plausible (Schikowski et al., 2014). Following Schikowski, in spite of 
plausible models of biological mechanisms, direct epidemiological evidence 
of the long-term effects of air pollution on COPD prevalence and incidence 
remains suggestive but not conclusive. In LIFE MED HISS, a protective 
effect has been seen but this can also be due to competitive risks: since 
COPD, lung cancer and ischaemic diseases share a common risk factor 
(smoking) and in addition the hospitalization for COPD should not 
happen (it is considered inappropriate because this disease should be 
managed at home) it is likely that people who smoke and whose con- 
ditions are exacerbated by air pollution have been hospitalized for lung 
cancer or myocardial infarction rather than for COPD. 
In contrast to what previously published (Kloog et al., 2012), we 
have not seen significant risk for diabetes and this could be an effect of 
the protective effect of Mediterranean diet which is spread among all 
the Italian population and could have mitigated the metabolic effect of 
chemicals. Concerning risks for urban and rural areas, there is no clear

evidence of higher risks in one of the two subgroups, but this seems to 
depend on the cause selected (Table 4). Information on alcohol and diet 
would have helped to clarify this topic, because of different behaviour 
among the two groups. 
Controversial results obtained for metropolitan areas can be a 
combination of exposure misclassification and of the small amount of 
individuals sampled in these study areas. Considering not significant 
HRs obtained for lung cancer in cities with > 250,000 inhabitants, the 
use of a single concentration value for metropolitan areas could be a 
source of potential exposure misclassification, given the large within- 
city range. However, this source of bias is due to the lack of more de- 
tailed information about home address or residential postcode, avoid- 
able if privacy policies would have permitted access to information at 
least on zip codes. The lack of permission has forced the use of con- 
centration values at municipality level. 

The lack of updated information for individual confounders and 
residential history is the major weakness of 
Italian 
Longitudinal Study. Internal Italian mobility is about 1 million and a 
half every year, over a population of about 59 million of inhabitants 
(about 2.5%). In year 2009, 1,312,763 individuals changed their re- 
sidence within Italian territory, whereas mobility outside Italian terri- 
tory is 39,000 (ISTAT, 2016). Taking into account relatively low mo- 
bility rates of Italian people and providing that factors which influence 
mobility are not only related to environmental factors, an eventual non- 
differential misclassification is more likely to reduce the effect towards 
the null, as epidemiological literature generally suggests. 
We used the exposure information as a proxy of past exposures. 
Having verified that in the Italian territory there were no differential 
temporal trends of the pollutants under investigation between me- 
tropolitan, urban and rural areas (Figs. 2 and 3), we trusted the use of 
the whole information available. The time-dependent approach aims at 
maximizing the information on exposure using available data. In this 
study the first year of the exposure available is contemporary to the 
time of the interview. Sensitivity analyses performed using only year 
2005 (first year with an adequate spatial coverage of monitoring sta- 
tions both for PM2.5 and for NO2) seemed to show higher risks asso- 
ciated to particulate matter. This may suggest that the use of a time- 
dependent approach, including years in the past, could lead to con- 
servative results due to less accuracy in particulate exposure measure. 
The adopted methodology correctly reproduces concentration mean 




levels typical of urban background stations, consistent with the MINNI 
spatial resolution. The system (MINNI-KED) underestimates observed 
levels at traffic stations in urban areas that are phenomena occurring at 
scales that cannot be solved at the adopted spatial resolution. This is a 
common problem of state-of-art national CTMs (Aguilera et al., 2013; 
Kiesewetter et al., 2014), likely to be solved in the future with routine 
application of more detailed modeling of urban areas. Moreover, up- 
scaling from gridded data to municipality level, needed to match the 
health data, preserves concentrations levels and main spatial patterns, 
but it amplifies the inability to capture spatial variations of small scale. 

The MED-HISS project is a pilot study that tested the applicability of 
surveillance systems for European countries, thanks to relative cheap- 
ness in comparison to traditional cohort studies. Results obtained are 
consistent with the literature, as is the case for lung cancer, and 
demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, with the possibility to 
study a broad range of causes (IARC, 2013). The applied methodology 
provided consistent estimates useful to describe the exposure of large 
population for surveillance purposes. 


European surveys are representative of population at some different 
level of urbanization. This permits to have a large amount of the cohort 
living in rural areas, which are less polluted, but usually also less stu- 
died. 
Regarding exposure to air pollution we have implemented a meth- 
odology taking into account data coming from CTMs and air quality 
monitoring network. Firstly, trough KED, observations were fused in 
pollutant concentration fields and secondly a weighted average proce- 
dure was used to up-scale assimilated concentration fields at munici- 
pality scale. The adopted methodology produced satisfactory results 
and consistent exposure estimates at municipality level. 




Due to the nature of the study, a wide list of causes has been ana- 
lyzed, controlling for confounders at individual level. The availability 
of confounders depends on the survey. In this study we have identified a 
core set of variables which have a high degree of comparability with 
other European surveys. In the Italian Longitudinal Study, we have the 
strong limitation of having no information on alcohol consumption and 
on diet. However, subsequent surveys partially overcome this problem, 
but nowadays there is no follow-up with hospital admissions. Due to 
privacy restrictions we do not have more detailed information on re- 
sidence than the municipality level, which could be a source of bias 
when studying metropolitan areas. Since only 8% of the cohort lives in 
metropolitan areas, this has a low impact on results from the Italian 
Longitudinal Study. A major source of misclassification is the lack of 
residential history before and after the interview, but the low rate of 
Italian mobility limits this problem. 
Results obtained confirm the relationship measured in other studies 
on air pollution and hospital admissions, and add new evidence for 
causes with few studies available (e.g. myocardial infarction). Evidence 
arises for circulatory system, also when considering more specific 
causes like cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial 
in- 
farction and angina. Results for lung cancer confirm what already 
published. New issues are added considering all neoplasms (having 
excluded lung cancer) and kidney cancer. A study using a wider follow- 
up and using a cohort derived from a more recent survey is ongoing.
