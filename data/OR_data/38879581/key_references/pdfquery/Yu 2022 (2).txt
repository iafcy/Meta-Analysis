Long-term exposure to fine particles �2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) has been linked to cancer 
mortality. However, the effect of wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure on cancer mortality risk is 
unknown. This study evaluates the association between wildfire-related PM2.5 and site-spe- 
cific cancer mortality in Brazil, from 2010 to 2016. 

Nationwide cancer death records were collected during 2010–2016 from the Brazilian Mor- 
tality Information System. Death records were linked with municipal-level wildfire- and non- 
wildfire-related PM2.5 concentrations, at a resolution of 2.0˚ latitude by 2.5˚ longitude. We 
applied a variant difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, adjust- 
ing for seasonal temperature and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Relative risks 
(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the exposure for specific cancer sites were 
estimated. Attributable fractions and cancer deaths were also calculated. In total, 1,332,526 
adult cancer deaths (age � 20 years), from 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, covering 136 mil- 
lion adults were included. The mean annual wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 
2.38 μg/m3, and the annual non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 8.20 μg/m3. The 
for mortality from all cancers was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01–1.03, p < 0.001) per 1-μg/m3

the attributable deaths were 37 per 100,000 population and ranged from 18/100,000 in the 
Northeast Region of Brazil to 71/100,000 in the Central-West Region. Study limitations 
included a potential lack of assessment of the joint effects of gaseous pollutants, an inability 
to capture the migration of residents, and an inability to adjust for some potential 
confounders.

Wildfires have become more frequent under climate change in recent years and pose a serious 
threat to human health. Even those living many kilometers away from wildfires are exposed to 
their smoke; thus, the health impacts of wildfires on the general population are a concern. 
Wildfires emit high concentrations of air pollutants and hazardous substances, including fine 
particles �2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5), which are regarded as the fire tracer in epidemiological 
studies. 
It has been estimated that 0.62% of all-cause deaths are annually attributable to the acute 
impacts of wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure globally [1]. Apart from death, increased risks of 
morbidity from respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, low birth weight and preterm 
birth, and influenza were observed after acute short-term wildfire smoke exposure [2]. Only a 
few studies have reported the long-term effect of wildfire-related PM2.5 (e.g., on general health 
and lung capacity) [3–6]. Currently, there are research gaps regarding the potential health 
impacts of long-term wildfire smoke exposure, including on the risk of cancer. 
Occupational studies investigating the risk of cancer in firefighters found that firefighters 
who experienced a high degree of wildfire smoke exposure had higher risks of cancer com- 
pared to firefighters exposed to limited wildfire smoke [7–9]. Wildfire-related particles were 
suggested to have smaller sizes and to contain more oxidative and proinflammatory compo-

many 
Brazilian people are exposed to fire smoke. Given that toxic smoke from wildfires travels long 
distances with wind, the assessment of the health effects of wildfires should not be limited to 
firefighters. If the association between wildfire-related PM2.5 and cancer mortality is higher 
than that for non-wildfire PM2.5, cancer could be an important consideration when making 
public health allocation strategies, especially in Brazil. Assessment of the impact of exposure to 
wildfire-related PM2.5 upon mortality from all types of cancer would also inform public health 
measures to improve cancer survival. 
To address this important issue, in this study, we analyze the associations between wildfire- 
related PM2.5 and cancer-specific mortality, using national mortality data spanning 2010–2016 
in Brazil. This study also AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Thisstudyalso:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording:

prevention strategies are warranted, to reduce cancer mortality risk in Brazil. This could 
be a health co-benefit of measures to preserve the Amazon rainforest and limit climate 
change. 



This research was conducted using data from the Brazil Mortality Information System. Our 
study did not employ a prospective protocol. Analyses were first planned and performed in 
August 2021. During peer review, we added a figure of sensitivity analysis and a table compar- 
ing the effect on cancer mortality and drowning (as the negative control). Changes to the 
paper were also made at the request of peer reviewers. 

Individual death records from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2016 AU : Ichanged2010to2016to1January2010to31December2016:Ifthisisnotcorrect; pleaseprovidecorrectfulldates: 
were collected from the Brazil 
Mortality Information System (Sistema de Informac¸ão sobre Mortalidade) [12]. Complete records 
from 5,565 municipalities, covering about 99.98% of the Brazilian population distributed in the 5 
regions of Brazil, were included in the analyses. Municipalities with missing mortality data and 
records with missing age or sex were excluded from the analyses. Each death record included 
information on municipality, age, sex, date, and primary cause of death, coded according to the 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems—10th Revision 
(ICD-10, https://icd.who.int/browse10/2019/en). Cancer deaths were totaled for every municipal- 
ity-year and grouped as follows: oral (C00–C10, C12–C14), nasopharynx (C11), esophagus (C15), 
stomach (C16), colon/rectum (C18–C21), liver (C22), gallbladder (C23–C24), pancreas (C25), lar- 
ynx (C32), lung (C33–C34), bone (C40–C41), skin (C43), breast (C50), cervix (C53), uterus 
(C54–C55), ovary (C56), prostate (C61), testis (C62), kidney (C64–C66), bladder (C67), brain 
(C70–C72), lymphoma (C81–C85), and leukemia (C91–C95). The death counts were also divided 
by sex and age groups (male versus female; aged 20–59 versus 60+ years). Child and adolescent 
cancers are not the same as adult cancers, with different types, treatment, and survival [13,14]; 
thus, only cancer deaths in individuals aged �20 years were included in the analyses. 

Daily all-source PM2.5 and wildfire-related PM2.5 were estimated during the study period; the 
details of model development and validation have been described in our previous work 
[1,15,16]. In summary, fire-induced change in PM2.5 was predicted by the chemical transport 
model GEOS-Chem (version 12.0.0) as the difference in PM2.5 from simulations with and 
without fire emissions. The anthropogenic emissions from 5 fire sources (boreal forest fires; 
tropical forest fires; savanna, grassland, and shrubland fires; temperate forest fires; agricultural 
waste burning) were from the EDGAR v4.2 inventory (http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/). The all- 
source PM2.5 was then downscaled from the original resolution of 2.0˚ latitude × 2.5˚ longitude 
to a higher resolution of 0.25˚ × 0.25˚ using a random forest model, taking into account the 
impacts of meteorology on PM2.5 in the fine grid cells. The downscaled all-source PM2.5 from 
GEOS-Chem was validated against ground-level PM2.5 monitored at 6,882 global sites, with a 
high coefficient of determination of up to 0.865 [1]. Then wildfire-related PM2.5 was derived as 
the product of all-source PM2.5 and the wildfire-to-all ratio calculated by the GEOS-Chem 
model. Annual mean non-wildfire- and wildfire-related PM2.5 were calculated from daily non- 
wildfire PM2.5 and wildfire-related PM2.5 during 2000AU : Pleasecheckthat2000iscorrectherein2000 (cid:0) 2016: 
–2016. The official geographical bound- 
aries of municipalities were downloaded from the website of the Brazilian Institute of Geogra- 
phy and Statistics (BIGS; https://www.ibge.gov.br/pt/inicio.html). 

Daily mean temperatures were calculated from hourly temperature records from the European 
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset, with a 0.25˚ × 




0.25˚ (approximately 28 km × 28 km) spatial resolution. This dataset has global coverage and 
is comparable to weather station observations in evaluating temperature–mortality associa- 
tions [17]. The municipality-level temperature was represented by the temperature of the grid 
at the geographical center of each municipality. 
Municipality-level population size and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for every 
year during the study period were downloaded from BIGS and then adjusted to United States 
dollars at the current price, according to the consumer price index during 2008–2020 and the 
average exchange rate in 2020 [18,19]. All variables were linked to death cases according to 
municipality and year. 
Statistical analysis: PM2.5–cancer mortality association 
A variant difference-in-differences (DID) approach with quasi-Poisson regression was applied 
to examine the associations between exposure and all cancers and site-specific cancer mortal- 
ity. The essence of the variant DID design is that the difference in temporal concentrations 
(wildfire- and non-wildfire-related PM2.5 in this study) is related to the difference in cancer 
mortality rates in each location during the study period [20]. Factors that keep stable during 
the study time and time trends in confounders that changed similarly across locations are con- 
that correlate with the wildfire- or non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentra- 
trolled. Confounders AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Confoundersthatcorrelate:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
tions and that change differently across regions by time should be adjusted in the model. The 
parameters of the variables are defined based on previous studies [21–23]. Temperature has 
been demonstrated to be associated with cancer mortality and thus is fitted in the main model 
[24,25]. Socioeconomic factors are represented by GDP per capita. Cancer-specific mortality 
associations were evaluated using the following model: 


where Ys,t represents the number of cases in municipality s, year t; Is is a dummy variable for 
municipality s; It is a dummy variable for year t; PM2.5s,t is the average wildfire- or non-wild- 
fire-related PM2.5 in municipality s, year t; βs is the intercept or slope for the linear terms; ln 
(Pops,t) is an offset term representing the natural log of the population in municipality s, year t; 
and Temp values are the means of summer and winter temperatures and their standard devia- 
tions (SDs). 
We also performed subgroup analyses by age group (20–59 years versus 60 years or above) 
and sex. We used fixed-effects meta-analyses to compare the effect estimates between sex and 
age groups. All results are expressed as relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% 
CIs) per 1-μg/m3 increase in annual average PM2.5 concentration. Several sensitivity analyses 
were performed—adding gas pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2), Normalized Difference Vegeta- 
tion Index (NDVI), and nighttime light (NTL); modeling the summer and winter tempera- 
tures using natural cubic splines with 2 or 3 degrees of freedom; and removing GDP per capita 
from the main model—to check the robustness of the main findings. 

The “gnm” package was used to perform the conditional Poisson regression model. The 
“mvmeta” package was used to compare the subgroup differences. Statistical significance was 
defined as a 2-sided p-value < 0.05. 
This study was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee. 
The Brazilian Ministry of Health did not require ethics approval or informed consent for sec- 
ondary analysis of aggregated anonymized data from the Mortality Information System. 





A total of 1,332,526 adult cancer death records from 5,565 municipalities, with municipality 
areas ranging from 3.56 to 159,533 km2, covering almost the total population of Brazil from 
2010 to 2016 were included in the main analyses. Cancer death counts from common cancer 
sites are presented in S1 Table. Of all records included, death counts varied from 0 to 123,571 
within municipalities. Mean annual wildfire-related PM2.5 was 2.38 μg/m3 (ranging from 0.60 
to 12.49 μg/m3), with regional variability (Table 1). The distribution of wildfire-related PM2.5 
showed a radial pattern from municipalities in the Central-West Region and surrounding 
areas (Fig 1). The proportion of wildfire-related PM2.5 of all-source PM2.5 is shown in S1 Fig. 
High total PM2.5 concentration in the North Region was observed, which may be associated 
with volcanic SO2, lightning NOx, biogenic soil NO, ocean emissions, biogenic emissions, very 
short-lived iodine and bromine species, and decaying plants (S2 Fig).

, indicating linear associations between wildfire- 
related PM2.5 and total cancer mortality (S4 Fig). Compared with non-wildfire PM2.5, people 
were more vulnerable to wildfire-related PM2.5 (Fig 2). 
The RR for mortality for all cancers combined per 1-μg/m3 increase of wildfire-related 
PM2.5 concentration was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01–1.03, p < 0.001). Cancer mortality was higher for 
wildfire-related PM2.5 than for other sources of PM2.5 (1.01 [95% CI 1.00–1.01], p = 0.007, p 
for difference = 0.003). Wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with mortality from cancers of 
the nasopharynx (1.10 [95% CI 1.04–1.16], p = 0.002), esophagus (1.05 [95% CI 1.01–1.08], p = 
0.012), stomach (1.03 [95% CI 1.01–1.06], p = 0.017), colon/rectum (1.08 [95% CI 1.05–1.11], 
p < 0.001), larynx (1.06 [95% CI 1.02–1.11], p = 0.003), breast (1.04 [95% CI 1.01–1.06], p =

0.002) (Fig 3). However, no significant association with lung cancer mortality was observed 
(1.00 [95% CI 0.98–1.01], p = 0.503). RRs associated with wildfire-related PM2.5 were greater 
than RRs for non-wildfire PM2.5 for colorectal (1.03 [95% CI 1.02–1.04], p = 0.001) and testis

To further examine vulnerable cancer sites and population subgroups, stratified analyses 
for mortality from potentially affected cancers by age and sex are shown in Fig 4. There was no 
significant difference for all cancers combined between males (1.02 [95% CI 1.01–1.04], p <

(1.03 [95% CI 1.01–1.04], p < 0.001; p for difference = 0.325). The RR for mortality from skin 
cancers was more pronounced in males, while a higher RR for nasopharyngeal cancer mortal- 
ity was observed in females. NotablyAU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Notably; :::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
, higher risks were observed for cancers of the colon/rec- 
tum, skin, and prostate among people aged 20–59 years, and higher RR for testicular cancer 
mortality was observed among people aged 60 years and older (Fig 4). Subgroup analyses for 
other cancer sites are shown in S6 Fig. Lung cancer mortality was significantly associated with 
non-wildfire PM2.5 in females (1.02 [95% CI 1.00–1.03], p = 0.013) and people 60 years or 
older (1.01 [95% CI 1.00–1.02], p = 0.010) (S7 Fig). 
Wildfire-related PM2.5 attributable cancer deaths ranged from 0 to 822/100,000 population 
for municipalities during the study period, assuming the association is causal (Fig 5). In total, 
there were 53,135 cancer deaths (95% CI 30,743–75,322)AU : Pleaseindicatewhatthevaluesinparenthesesð30; 743 (cid:0) 75; 322Þindicate : 95%CI?range?

fire-related PM2.5 exposure from 2010 to 2016. Though the highest cancer mortality rate was 
in the South Region, the number of attributable cancer deaths per 100,000 population was 
higher in the Central-West Region (75/100,000). Males and people 60 years or older experi- 
enced a higher cancer burden. Along with AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Alongwith:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
increased cancer cases and higher wildfire-related 
PM2.5 exposure, the number of attributable cancer deaths was more pronounced in 2015 and 
2016, which is consistent with the high wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure in those years 
(Table 2). State-level attributable cancer deaths are presented in S2 Table. 
Sensitivity analyses showed that our estimation was robust. The estimations using 2-year

similar (S3 Fig). We also compared associations estimated by adding other air pollutants (CO, 
NO2, O3, SO2), NDVI, and nighttime light; changing the degrees of freedom of temperature;

as the outcome for a negative control analysis: Drowning was not significantly associated with 
wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure (S4 Table). 

We did a national analysis of the association between wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure and can- 
cer mortality. We found that wildfire-related PM2.5 was significantly associated with an 
increased risk of all-cause cancer death in Brazil during 2010–2016. Increased risks were 
detected for cancers of the nasopharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon/rectum, larynx, AU : Pleasecheckthattheinclusionof boneinthislistisasintended: 
skin, 
breast, prostate, and testis. Notably, we found that people may be more vulnerable to wildfire 
smoke than non-wildfire PM2.5 sources, especially for esophageal, colorectal, and testicular 
cancer. To our best knowledgeAU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Toourbest:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording:

is an outcome reflecting both the incidence of cancer and survival after 
diagnosis [26]. The association between wildfire-related PM2.5 and cancer mortality may be 
explained by increased cancer incidence and shortened survival. PM2.5 is classified by the

incidence association, cancer patients with weakened immune systems may be more vulnera- 
ble to wildfire-related PM2.5, resulting in a significant mortality association [28,29]. Although 
the mechanisms are not clear, some other studies have provided evidence for related cancers. 
According to previous studies, all-source PM2.5 exposure may shorten cancer survival [30,31]. 
The potential AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Thepotentialmechanism:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
mechanism for shortened survival may be accelerated cancer progression due to

the digestive tract, altering the immune response and the gut microbiota and epithelial cells 
[37]. Moreover, PM2.5 binds chemicals with endocrine-disrupting properties [38] that may be 
associated with cancer development and progression of hormone-sensitive cancers, such as 
breast and testicular cancer. Findings from an epidemiological study of breast cancer [39] and 
mechanistic studies of testicular cancer [40] also support the hypothesisAU : Ichangedsupporttheassumptiontosupportthehypothesis:Ifthisisnotcorrect; pleaseeditasnecessary: 
. Therefore, it is biolog- 
ically plausible that exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 might increase mortality for cancers at 
different sites. 
Wildfire particles are smaller than those from urban sources, and particles reaching miles 
away may have greater oxidative potential [41,42]. These characteristics of wildfire particles 
pose a significant health risk to individuals. The health impact of short-term exposure to

wildfire smoke has been well documented for all-cause mortality [1,43]. In comparison with 
the short-term effects of wildfire smoke, far fewer studies have included longer term health 
impacts, and no study to our knowledge has shown an association between wildfire particles 
and cancer. Some studies have reported an association between all-source PM2.5 and cancer 
show a higher risk for wildfire-related PM2.5 than for PM2.5 from non- 
risks [44]. Our resultsAU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Ourresults:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording:

cer at different sites would show different responses to wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure. 

are still unknown in the general population, but higher cancer risks were observed among 
wildfire firefighters who were most exposed to wildfire smoke. The American Cancer Society 
(ACS) Cancer Prevention Study II demonstrated that wildland firefighters have an increased 
risk of lung cancer mortality [45]. Studies from Australia AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}StudiesfromAustralia:::}captureyourmeaning:Inparticular; pleasecheckthatmalefirefightersðratherthanmalewildfirefirefightersorvolunteermalewildfirefirefightersÞiscorrect:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
showed possible increased risks of 
colorectal and prostate cancers in paid male landscape firefighters, colorectal and kidney can- 
cer in male firefighters, and all malignancies in female landscape firefighters [46–48]. How- 
ever, no increased cancer mortality risks were observed, which may be due to the “healthy 
volunteer” effect [46–48]. No other studies of cancer among wildfire firefighters were identi- 
fied in the literature. The risks of cancer in firefighters, not limited to wildfires, are still uncer- 
tain. In line with our results, increased risks of some respiratory system, digestive tract, skin, 
and male reproductive cancers were reported in firefighters, but some protective associations 
were also observed, which again may be due to the healthy volunteer effect [49–54]. Consistent 
with previous studies, lung cancer was not observed to have a higher mortality risk associated 
with wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure, while statistically significant associations were observed 
in female and older populations with non-wildfire PM2.5 in the current study [46–54]. How- 
ever, our previous study conducted in the same population and over a similar study period 
showed significant associations between all-source PM2.5 and lung cancer mortality for all sub- 
groups (both sexes and age groups) [55]. The increased risk of lung cancer mortality may be 
explained by non-wildfire sources of PM2.5 exposure, such as industry and transportation 
emissions, but not wildfires. Further studies on different sources of PM2.5 and histological sub- 
type-specific estimation are warranted. 
Another kind of exposure similar to wildfire smoke is the emission from biomass burning. 
The literature suggests that indoor biomass burning is associated with lung cancer risk [56,57]. 
Robust evidence has been provided that biomass smoke from household cooking and heating 
is also associated with higher risks of gastrointestinal cancers [58–60]. Furthermore, indoor 
wood-burning stoves were suggested to be associated with a modestly increased risk of breast 
cancer in the Sister Study from the US [61]. An increased risk of hypopharyngeal cancer was 
also observed among lifelong users of wood in a case–control study from India [62]. Most 
studies were not able to assess the effect of biomass burning separately, as participants using 
fossil fuels included biomass and coal as cooking and heating fuels. However, in vitro studies 
have demonstrated that particles emitted by wood fires have mutagenic and endocrine-dis- 
rupting capacity, providing biological support for the possible role of wildfires in the patho- 
genesis of hormone-sensitive cancers [63,64]. 

firefighter smoke exposure and indoor biomass burning pollution may not 
be directly comparable with wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure in the general population, this lit- 
erature sheds some light on cancer-specific risks. The current analysis establishes a higher risk 
for cancer, which means better control of wildfires is essential for cancer prevention in Brazil. 
In addition, individual-, community-, and national-level strategies should be considered to 
minimize fire exposure. However, AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}However:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
the effectiveness of personal actions such as relocation, stay- 
ing indoors, or wearing masks is still controversial [2]. The investigation of wildfire prediction 
models applied to Brazil is ongoing [65]. Warning systems for extremely hot weather 




implemented in many countries may also provide a warning for increased wildfire risk [66]. 
Systemic strategies and guidance are warranted. 
Major strengths of this study include that it is the first study to estimate the association 
between wildfire-related PM2.5 and cancer-specific mortality, to our best knowledge. Also, this 
study is based on national death records, and the large sample size allowed the estimation of 
associations representative for the total Brazilian population. Lastly, the variant difference-in- 
differences approach could adjust for most of the unmeasured confounders stable during the 
study time and those that changed similarly across regions. 

in the analyses, and potential joint effects of gaseous pollutants were not estimated. Our esti- 
mation of wildfire-related PM2.5 could not capture the complex mixture of environmental pol- 
lutants released during wildfires, and thus further studies are needed to refine the exposure 
metrics. Additionally, some confounders related to wildfires could not be adjusted for in the 
model due to data unavailability, including data on firefighting foam composition. For exam- 
ple, AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Forexample:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
associations between firefighting chemicals and cancer at various cancer sites have been 
observed in previous studies: Firefighting foam containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
was suggested to be related to increased risk of breast cancer, bladder cancer, etc. [67]. Second, 
PM2.5 concentrations were estimated at a global scale, and regional validation was not available 
due to limited ground-level monitors in Brazil. Third, municipality-level exposures were used 
in the analyses because individual exposure data were not available. The use of aggregated data 
may lead to some exposure misclassification, including the inability to capture the migration 
of residents between municipalities. However, potential effects of migration may be limited, as 
more than 96% of adults had an uninterrupted time of residence in a municipality for at least 2 
years according, according to the 2010 census results published by BIGS [68]. Finally, the use 
of registry data, rather than individual survey data, may have led to some misclassification of 
residential address and main cause of death, which may lead to bias in the association estima- 
tions. Some potentiallyAU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Somepotentiallychanging:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
cancer mortality were ignored in the analyses, due to the limited availability of individual life- 
style data. Further, the data used in this study did not allow an assessment of competing risks, 
as only the primary cause of death was recorded. Cancer patients who died from other causes 
(e.g., heart attack) could not be included. Also, our use of 2-year average PM2.5 concentration 
as the exposure may be not appropriate for cancers with a longer survival time. Overall, further 
cohort studies are warranted to give a more accurate risk estimate. 

In summary, this study provides the first quantitative estimate of the association between 
wildfire-related PM2.5 and cancer-specific mortality across Brazil. The potentially AU : Pleasecheckthattheeditstothesentence}Thepotentiallyhigherrisk:::}captureyourmeaning:Ifnot; pleaseprovidecorrectwording: 
higher risk 
of wildfire-related PM2.5 compared with non-wildfire-related PM2.5 for all cancers combined 
suggests that the wildfire control and systemic prevention strategies are warranted to reduce 
cancer mortality risk in Brazil. This could be a health co-benefit of measures to preserve the 
Amazon rainforest and limit climate change.
