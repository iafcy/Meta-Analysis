Background: Vehicle engine exhaust includes ultrafine particles with a large surface area and containing absorbed 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, transition metals and other substances. Ultrafine particles and soluble chemicals 
can be transported from the airways to other organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and brain. Our aim was to 
investigate whether air pollution from traffic is associated with risk for other cancers than lung cancer. 
Methods: We followed up 54,304 participants in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort for 20 selected cancers 
in the Danish Cancer Registry, from enrolment in 1993-1997 until 2006, and traced their residential addresses from 
1971 onwards in the Central Population Registry. We used modeled concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
amount of traffic at the residence as indicators of traffic-related air pollution and used Cox models to estimate 
incidence rate ratios (IRRs) after adjustment for potential confounders. 
Results: NOx at the residence was significantly associated with risks for cervical cancer (IRR, 2.45; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.01;5.93, per 100 μg/m3 NOx) and brain cancer (IRR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.25;4.19, per 100 μg/m3 NOx). 
Conclusions: This hypothesis-generating study indicates that traffic-related air pollution might increase the risks for 
cervical and brain cancer, which should be tested in future studies. 
Background 
It has been known for decades that urban air is polluted 
by mutagenic and carcinogenic substances [1], although 
at concentrations much lower than those in e.g. cigar- 
ette smoke and certain work environments. Nielsen 
et al. [2] found that the concentrations of mutagenic 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Copenha- 
gen were similar to those in other cities in industrialized 
countries and concluded that traffic was the major 
source of PAHs in Copenhagen in the early 1990s. Ubi- 
quitous air pollution with low levels of carcinogens is a 
public health concern, because large populations are 
exposed; therefore, even a marginally increased risk for 
cancer at the individual level would result in many cases 
at the population level. 
Ultrafine particles, < 100 nm in diameter, have 
received much attention since the 1990s because of 
their high numbers and large surface area [3]. They

constitute about 50% of the total surface area of depos- 
ited particles in the lung [4]. The airways are the pri- 
mary target organs, but accumulating evidence from 
experiments in animals shows that ultrafine particles 
can translocate to other organs, such as the liver, kid- 
neys, heart and brain [5-7]. Although the number of 
particles that accumulate in secondary target organs is 
several orders of magnitude lower than the lung dose, it 
may not be negligible for carcinogenic processes [4,8]. 
Previous epidemiological studies have shown associa- 
tions between ambient air pollution and risk for lung 
cancer [9-13], but other cancers might also be associated 
with exposure to polluted air. Cancers of the mouth, 
pharynx, and larynx are strongly related to smoking and 
might therefore also be related to other sources of air 
pollution, as indicated by associations with exposure to 
combusted indoor fuel [14] and occupational exposure to 
engine exhaust [15-18]. 
Bladder cancer has been associated with residence in a 
polluted city area in a few studies of the general popula- 
tion [19,20] and with occupational exposure to air pollu- 
tion (traffic, engine exhaust, PAHs) in several (but not

all) studies [21-24]. Other cancers have been studied 
only sparsely in relation to air pollution. Occupational 
exposure to diesel engine exhaust was associated with 
risks for cervical [17], ovarian [23], and gastric cancer 
[25], and several studies indicated associations between 
occupations associated with exposure to air pollution 
and risk for kidney cancer [15,16,26]. An ecological 
association was found between ambient air emissions of 
volatile organic compounds and brain cancer incidence 
in Indiana, USA [27], and a recent study indicated that 
air pollution at the residence increased the risk for 
breast cancer [28]. Benzene at relatively high occupa- 
tional concentrations is a known leukemogen, and a few 
studies have suggested that ambient concentrations near 
point sources [29] and traffic [30] might be associated 
with risk for hematological cancers. 
We have recently reported on traffic-related air pollu- 
tion and lung cancer in a large Danish cohort [13]. The 
individual-level assessment of exposure for all cohort 
members facilitates a hypothesis-generating screening of 
possible associations with other cancers than lung cancer. 
The aim of the study reported here was to investigate 
whether air pollution from traffic at the residence was 
associated with risks for 20 selected, relatively frequent 
cancers in a large Danish cohort. 
Methods 
Design and study participants 
During 1993-1997, 57,053 men (48%) and women (52%) 
aged 50-64 years and living in Copenhagen and Aarhus 
areas were recruited into the Diet, Cancer and Health 
cohort study [31]. The baseline examination included a 
self-administered questionnaire on dietary habits, which 
covered 192 food and beverage items. The participants 
also filled in a questionnaire on smoking habits (status, 
intensity, and duration), occupation, length of school 
attendance, reproductive factors, history of diseases and 
medication, and a number of other health-related items 
[31]. Smoking intensity was calculated by equating a cigar- 
ette to 1 g, a cheroot or a pipe to 3 g, and a cigar to 4.5 g 
of tobacco. Staff in the study clinics obtained anthropo- 
metric measurements, including height and weight. Rele- 
vant Danish ethical committees and data protection 
agencies approved the study, and written informed con- 
sent was obtained from all participants. 
Each cohort member was followed up for cancer 
occurrence until 27 June 2006 in the Danish Cancer 
Registry [32] and the Danish Pathology Data Bank by 
use of the unique personal identification number. We 
traced the date of death, emigration, or disappearance 
and retrieved the addresses of each cohort member 
between 1 January 1971 and 27 June 2006 in the Central 
Population Registry by use of the personal identification 
number. The dates of moving into and leaving each 
address were noted, and the addresses were linked to 
the Danish address database to obtain geographical 
coordinates (denoted in the following as ‘geocodes’), 
which were obtained for 94% of the addresses. 
Exposure assessment 
The outdoor concentration of NOx was calculated for 
each year at the residential addresses of each cohort 
member with the Danish AirGIS modeling system (see 
http://www.dmu.dk/en/air/models/airgis/ and [33]). Air- 
GIS is based on a geographical information system and 
provides estimates of traffic-related air pollution with 
high temporal and address level spatial resolution. Air 
pollution at a location is calculated as the sum of three 
contributors: (1) local air pollution from street traffic, 
calculated from input data on traffic (intensity and 
type), emission factors for the car fleet, street and build- 
ing geometry, and meteorology; (2) urban background, 
calculated from data on urban vehicle emission density, 
city dimensions, and building heights; and (3) regional 
background, estimated from trends at rural monitoring 
stations and from national vehicle emissions. 
Input data for the AirGIS system were established from 
various sources and were integrated into the model. A 
geographical information system (GIS) road network, 
including construction year and traffic data for the period 
1960-2005, was developed and a database on emission fac- 
tors for the Danish car fleet, with data on light- and 
heavy-duty vehicles back to 1960, was built and entered 
into the emission module of the street pollution model. 
The national topographic GIS database of buildings was 
supplemented by the construction year and building 
height from the national Building and Dwelling Register, 
which provided the correct street and building geometry 
for a given year at a given address. The geocodes of an 
address refer to the location of the front door with a preci- 
sion within 5 m for most addresses. With the geocode of 
an address and a specified year as the starting point, the 
AirGIS system automatically generates street configuration 
data for the street pollution model, including street orien- 
tation, street width, building heights in wind sectors, traffic 
amount, speed and type as well as other data required as 
inputs for the modeling system. Air pollution is calculated 
in 2 m height at the façade of the address building. The 
AirGIS system has been successfully validated in several 
studies [34-36] and the correlation between modeled and 
measured 1/2-year mean NO2 concentrations at 204 posi- 
tions in the greater Copenhagen area showed a correlation 
coefficient (r) of 0.90 with measured concentrations being 
on average 11% lower than the modeled [35]. We also 
compared modeled and measured one-month mean 
concentrations of NOx and NO2 over a 12-year period 
(1995-2006) in a busy street in Copenhagen (Jagtvej, 
25,000 vehicles per day, street canyon), which showed 
Raaschou-Nielsen et al. Environmental Health 2011, 10:67 
http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/67 

correlation coefficients (r) of 0.88 for NOx and 0.67 for 
NO2. The modeled mean concentration over the whole 
12-year period was 6% lower than the measured concen- 
trations for NOx and 12% lower for NO2 [36]. Thus, the 
model predicted both geographical and temporal variation 
well. 
We used the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
as an indicator of air pollution from traffic because NOx 
level correlates strongly with other traffic-related pollu- 
tants in Danish streets, such as particles: r = 0.93 for 
total particle number concentration (size, 10-700 nm) 
and r = 0.70 for particles with a diameter < 10 μm [37]. 
We calculated the time-weighted average NOx concen- 
tration at all addresses from 1 January 1971 until cancer 
diagnosis, censoring, or end of follow-up and entered it 
as a time-dependent variable into the statistical cancer 
risk model. If NOx could not be calculated because of 
failed geocoding of an address, we imputed the concen- 
tration from that calculated at the preceding address, or 
that at the subsequent address if the NOx concentration 
was missing for the first address. We included only par- 
ticipants for whom the residential addresses were 
known and geocoded for 80% or more of the time 
between 1 January 1971 and censoring, i.e. persons for 
whom NOx concentrations were imputed for less than 
20% of the time. 
We used the geocode of the address at the time of enrol- 
ment into the cohort and the GIS road network with traf- 
fic data to derive two variables indicating the amount of 
traffic near the residence: presence of a street with a traffic 
density > 10,000 vehicles per day within 50 m of the resi- 
dence, and the total number of kilometers driven by vehi- 
cles within 200 m of the residence each day. 
We considered the calculated NOx concentration as 
our primary exposure variable because it takes into 
account a number of factors that affect traffic-related air 
pollution and because it reflects exposure over several 
decades. The two supplementary measures of traffic at 
the residence are simple indicators that reflect only the 
time of enrolment into the cohort. The three exposure 
indicators correlated moderately, with correlation coeffi- 
cients of 0.53 between calculated NOx and presence of a 
major road within 50 m, 0.43 between calculated NOx 
and traffic load within 200 m, and 0.43 between pre- 
sence of a major road within 50 m and traffic load 
within 200 m. We gave most weight to the NOx mea- 
sure in interpreting the results, so that the results for 
the two traffic indicators could strengthen or weaken 
interpretation of an effect of NOx as a traffic-related air 
polluter. 
The Danish AirGIS modeling system cannot provide 
reliable estimates for historical particulate matter con- 
centrations because the required input data on historical 
urban background concentrations and historical emis- 
sion factors for the Danish car fleet are not available. 
Statistical methods 
The end-points for the risk analyses were first primary 
cancers others than lung cancer. We included only can- 
cer types of which there were more than 30 cases during 
follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated 
with Cox proportional hazards models, and 95% confi- 
dence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of the 
Wald test. Age was the time scale, which ensured that 
the risk estimates were based on comparisons of indivi- 
duals at exactly the same age, and analyses were cor- 
rected for delayed entry at the time of enrolment. 
People with a cancer diagnosis before entry were 
excluded from the analyses. Participants were censored 
at the time of death, the time of loss to follow-up due 
to emigration or disappearance, the time of a cancer 
diagnosis other than that under study, or 27 June 2006 
(end of follow-up), whichever came first. 
The analyses were adjusted for potential confounding 
factors defined a priori for each cancer site on the basis of 
two criteria: 1) being an established or likely risk factor 
for the cancer and 2) data being available. These were: 
smoking status (never, former, current), smoking intensity 
(lifetime average, linear), smoking duration (linear), envir- 
onmental tobacco smoke (dichotomous, no or low, i.e. “no 
smoker in the home and environmental tobacco smoke at 
work for less than 4 h/day”, versus high), length of school 
attendance (< 8, 8-10 and > 10 years), physical activity 
during leisure time (sports: yes/no and h/week for active 
people (linear)), body mass index (kg/m2; linear), dietary 
intake of fruit (linear), vegetables (linear), red meat (lin- 
ear), fiber (linear), selenium (sum of diet and supplements; 
linear), calcium (sum of diet and supplements; linear), 
alcohol intake (yes/no and g/day (linear)), use of hormone 
replacement therapy (never/ever and duration for ever 
users (linear)), use of oral contraceptives (never/ever and 
duration for ever users (linear)), number of childbirths 
(none/any and number (linear)), age at first childbirth 
(none/any and age (linear)), lactation (none/any and time 
(linear)), previous benign breast tumor (yes/no), previous 
diagnosis of hypertension (yes/no), skin reaction to sun 
(severe or moderate burning, light to no burn), tanning 
during summer (very or moderately dark, faint or not 
tanned), nevi (no or few, moderate or many) and freckles 
(none or few, some or many). Moreover, we defined 
dichotomous indicators of exposure to occupational carci- 
nogens specific to each cancer site from questionnaire 
responses about jobs held for a minimum of 1 year and 
from evaluations in the International Agency for Research 
on Cancer series http://monographs.iarc.fr/ (see Addi- 
tional file 1).

We tested the linearity of the adjusted associations 
between NOx concentration and risk for each of the 20 
cancers by the likelihood ratio test, i.e. testing whether 
adding non-linear terms improved the fit over the linear 
model; p < 0.05 was used as criterion for non-linearity. 
The exposure-response function for 19 sites did not devi- 
ate significantly from linearity, while a deviation of border- 
line significance was found for pancreas cancer. Thus, for 
all 20 cancers we estimated the IRRs as linear functions 
per 100-μg/m3 increment in NOx and per 104 vehicle km/ 
day traffic load within 200 m of the residence. Non-linear 
exposure-response curves with 95% confidence limits are 
presented graphically for selected cancers. These functions 
were estimated with the cph function, survival library, R 
statistical software 2.9.0 using restricted cubic spline in the 
coxph function. The plots were produced with the plot 
function in the design library and reflect exposure- 
response functions after adjustment for cancer-specific 
sets of potential confounders. 
Results 
Of the 57,053 cohort members, 571 were excluded 
because of a cancer diagnosis before enrolment, 2 because 
of uncertain date of cancer diagnosis, 960 for which an 
address history was not available in the Central Population 
Registry or their baseline address could not be geocoded, 
and 1,216 because exposure was assessed for less than 
80% of the time between 1 January 1971 and diagnosis or 
censoring. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of 
the 54,304 cohort members who were included, who were 
followed up for an average of 9.6 years. The participants 
were on average 56.7 years old at enrolment, and there 
were slightly more women than men. About one third had 
never smoked; the median duration of smoking among 
ever smokers was 33 years. The median time-weighted 
average NOx concentration at the residences between 
1971 and the censoring date was 21.9 μg/m3 (minimum, 
13.8 μg/m3; maximum, 347 μg/m3). At enrolment, 8.3% of 
the cohort members lived at a residence within 50 m of a 
street with a traffic density > 10,000 vehicles per day. 
Table 2 shows the IRRs of 20 cancers in association with 
concentrations of NOx at the residence. Table 3 shows 
IRRs in association with amount of traffic at the residence. 
In the adjusted analyses, three sites showed significant 
associations: primary liver cancer in association with traffic 
within 200 m of the residence, cervical cancer in associa- 
tion with NOx at the residence, a major street within 50 m 
of the residence and traffic within 200 m of the residence, 
and brain cancer in association with NOx at the residence 
and a major street within 50 m of the residence. 
Adjustment for potential confounders decreased the 
IRRs for many cancers, including some smoking-related 
cancers, such as esophagus and bladder cancer, and 
breast cancer, whereas the IRR for e.g. cervical cancer 
was less strongly affected by adjustment. 
Figure 1 shows adjusted exposure-response functions 
between NOx concentration at the residence and risks for 
each of the three cancers for which significant IRRs are 
shown in Tables 2, 3. The risk for cervical cancer 
increased steadily with increasing exposure, the risk for 
brain cancer increased mostly at concentrations in the 
lower end of the exposure range, and the risk for liver can- 
cer increased mostly in the upper end of the exposure 
range. 
Discussion 
We found significant associations and exposure- 
response patterns between traffic-related air pollution at 
the residence and risks for cervical and brain cancer. 
The strengths of this study include a 10-year prospective 
follow-up of a relatively large cohort and adjustment for 
potential confounders. Individual assessment of the expo- 
sure of all cohort members allowed us to link air pollution 
to all major types of cancer. Virtually complete follow-up 
for incident cancers was possible through nationwide 
population-based registries, and complete follow-up for 
vital status was available from the Central Population 
Registry. Another strength of the study is the availability 
of residential address histories dating back to 1971, so that 
exposure could be assessed over several decades. A limita- 
tion of this study is the relatively few cases of some types 
of cancer, although more than 100 cases were identified 
for 11 of the 20 cancers included. The inclusion of cancers 
at 20 different sites means that the results should be inter- 
preted with caution. The positive findings for cancers at 
sites for which there is no or little previous epidemiologi- 
cal evidence of an association with air pollution should be 
considered as the basis for hypothesis-generating. 
Exposure assessment is a major challenge in studies of 
the health effects of long-term exposure to air pollution. 
We used three markers of air pollution from traffic at resi- 
dences, which were moderately correlated (r, 0.43-0.53). 
The outdoor NOx level at all addresses was calculated 
over decades from a validated model that requires com- 
prehensive input data; the two other markers are simple, 
intuitively understandable measures of traffic at the resi- 
dence at the time of enrolment. The dispersion models we 
used to assess NOx levels at the addresses of study partici- 
pants have been successfully validated [34-36] and applied 
[12,13,38]. Although markers of air pollution concentra- 
tions are inevitably somewhat uncertain, the resulting 
non-differential misclassification would create artificial 
associations only in rare situations [39]. If the geocoding, 
and therefore also the exposure assessment, failed at an 
address, we imputed the air pollution concentration from 
the previous or next address. Since the imputation strategy

fully assessed for at least 80% of the time from 1971 until

This study shows an exposure-response association 
between concentration of NOx at residence and risk for 
cervical cancer, and associations were also seen for indi- 
cators of traffic at the residence. Occupational exposure 
to diesel engine exhaust was previously associated with 
risk for cervical cancer in a study with no adjustment for 
tobacco smoking [17], but to our knowledge no study has 
been conducted of the exposure of the general popula- 
tion to ambient air pollution. We adjusted our analyses 
for smoking, education, and oral contraceptive use but

had no information on human papillomavirus (HPV) 
infection, which is a major cause of cervical cancer [40]. 
It is possible that HPV infection is more prevalent among 
women living in areas with heavy traffic and air pollution. 
Early findings of associations between smoking and cervi- 
cal cancer were similarly suspected of confounding by 
HPV infection, although today smoking is an established 
risk factor for this cancer. Further, we cannot exclude the 
possibility that compliance with the nation-wide cervical 
cancer screening program differs in areas with high and 
low levels of air pollution due to differences in educa- 
tional level. However, the educational level differed only 
little between cohort members living at addresses with 
high and low air pollution levels [13] and the results in 
the present study was adjusted for educational level mini- 
mizing the potential for confounding. The hypothesis of 
an association between air pollution and risk for cervical 
cancer should be further investigated in a study with con- 
trol for HPV infection (in addition to other risk factors), 
preferably with more power than the current study. 
We found an exposure-response association between 
NOx at the residence and risk for brain cancer, which was 
almost doubled for people living close to a street with high 
traffic density. In general, the causes of brain cancer 
remain unknown, although high-dose ionizing radiation 
and certain genetic syndromes are established risk factors 
[41]. These, however, seem unlikely to be associated with 
air pollution at the residential address. A previous study in 
Denmark indicated a higher risk for brain cancer in asso- 
ciation with agricultural class and higher income [42]. 
These factors are probably inversely associated with air 
pollution from traffic in Denmark, and, if they were risk 
factors for brain tumors, we would expect any confound- 
ing to have decreased the IRR for brain cancer in associa- 
tion with air pollution. There is growing experimental 
evidence that ultrafine particles can reach the brain both 
via the systemic circulation through the blood-brain bar- 
rier and via the olfactory neuronal pathway [3,5], causing 
an inflammatory response [43,44]. Further, a recent study 
showed that exposure to diesel engine exhaust causes 
functional changes in the human brain indicating cortical 
stress response [45]. Boeglin et al. [27] showed an ecologi- 
cal association between emissions of volatile organic com- 
pounds and brain cancer incidence rates at county level in

Figure 1 Non-linear exposure-response functions (filled lines; 95% confidence limits indicated by dashed lines) between average NOx 
concentration (μg/m3) at residences from 1971 onwards and risks for primary liver cancer, cervical cancer and brain cancer. The 
functions were adjusted for cancer-specific sets of potential confounders, listed in the last column of Table 2. The figure includes the exposure 
range between the 5th and 95th percentiles (14.8-69.4 μg/m3 NOx). The exposure distribution is marked on the x-axis. 
the USA; but a large cohort study with individual adjust- 
ment for potential confounders showed that people who 
lived in metropolitan areas with higher air pollution levels 
measured at routine monitoring network stations did not 
have a higher risk for death from brain cancer [46]. 
Although our study is smaller, it has several advantages, 
including individual exposure assessment, thus accounting 
for within-city variations in air pollution concentrations, 
which might explain the difference in results. Further- 
more, we studied brain cancer incidence, whereas the US 
study measured mortality. If survival after brain cancer dif- 
fers in different metropolitan areas and survival correlates 
with air pollution levels, the results of a mortality study 
would differ from those of a study of incidence. We 
recommend that studies be conducted to replicate our 
finding of an increased incidence of brain cancer in asso- 
ciation with individual-level exposure to air pollution. 
We found a borderline significantly increased risk for 
liver cancer associated with traffic within 200 m of the 
residence, after adjustment for relevant confounders, 
although there was no significant association with NOx 
levels. There is consistent evidence that liver cancer is 
associated with tobacco smoking [47]. One of the few 
previous epidemiological studies on ambient air pollu- 
tion and liver cancer was a retrospective cohort study, 
which showed an increased risk in urban bus drivers 
and tramway employees [16]. Mucociliary clearance of 
particles deposited in the airways usually leads to gastro- 
intestinal exposure due to swallowing, and, in experi- 
mental studies, intragastric exposure of animals to diesel 
exhaust particles induced oxidative stress and DNA 
damage in the liver [48]. In addition, particles translo- 
cated to the circulation accumulated in Kupfer cells in 
the liver, with very slow elimination and further poten- 
tial oxidative stress [49]. 
Our study also showed that the risk for kidney cancer 
increased with NOx concentration at the residence. Sev- 
eral studies of occupational groups, such as transport 
workers, drivers, policemen, metal foundry workers, and 
gasoline service station workers exposed to gasoline 
vapors, engine exhaust, PAHs, and other air pollutants, 
have indicated weakly increased risks for kidney cancer 
[15,16,26], although the literature is neither consistent 
[23] nor conclusive [50]. The indication in the present 
study of an association between ambient air pollution at 
the residence and risk for kidney cancer in a general 
population should be confirmed before conclusions can 
be drawn. 
Our study showed a weak, insignificant association 
between traffic-related air pollution and risk for breast

cancer. A recent study in Montreal, Canada, showed 
that the risk for breast cancer was associated with NO2 
concentrations at the residence [28], and a study in New 
York, USA, indicated an association between early-life 
exposure to air pollution at the residence and risk for 
this cancer [51]. PAH-induced breast tumor mutations 
might explain any link between air pollution and risk 
for breast cancer [52]. 
Previous studies have shown associations between 
risks for upper aerodigestive tract cancers and indoor 
fuel combustion [14] and occupational exposure to 
engine exhaust [15-18], and our study also indicated a 
possible association between ambient traffic-related air 
pollution and cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx, 
although the result was insignificant. 
Our results showed a weak, insignificant association 
between traffic-related air pollution and bladder cancer. 
The evidence of an association between ambient air pol- 
lution and bladder cancer in the general population is 
not conclusive [19,20,30]. 
Benzene at relatively high occupational concentrations is 
a known leukemogen, and a few studies have suggested 
that ambient concentrations near point sources [29] and 
near traffic [30] might be associated with risks for hemato- 
logical cancers, whereas other studies found no such asso- 
ciation [53,54]. The exposure of the general population to 
benzene is much lower than the lowest effect level seen in 
studies of occupational exposure, so that any related risk 
for leukemia in the general population would probably not 
be detectable with current methods [55]. Our results are 
in accordance with this notion. 
Although we found associations between NOx concen- 
tration and the risks for some cancers, NOx is an indicator 
of vehicle engine exhaust, which is a complex mixture of 
many carcinogenic and mutagenic chemicals [1]. The NOx 
concentration correlates closely with that of particulate 
matter, especially the ultrafine fraction emitted from diesel 
engines in Danish streets [37]. Although it is difficult to 
disentangle the effects of single air pollutants in epidemio- 
logical designs, particulate matter from traffic emissions 
appears to be the most important determinant of cancer 
risk. Ultrafine particles have a large surface area and con- 
tain absorbed PAHs, transition metals and other sub- 
stances, which cause oxidative stress, inflammation and 
direct and indirect genotoxicity [56,57]. Further, there is 
evidence that ultrafine particles can translocate from the 
airways to other organs [7], which might explain our find- 
ing of higher risks for cervical and brain cancer in cohort 
members living at residences with high levels of traffic- 
related air pollution. 
Conclusions 
In conclusion, this cohort study shows significant asso- 
ciations between traffic-related air pollution at 
residential addresses over several decades and risks for 
cervical and brain cancer. Although experimental evi- 
dence shows that ultrafine particles can translocate from 
the airways to other organs, our results are based on 
hypothesis-generating screening of 20 cancers and 
future epidemiological studies are needed to provide 
further information on possible risks for cancer asso- 
ciated with traffic-related air pollution. In particular the 
hypotheses of associations with brain and cervical can- 
cer require further testing.
