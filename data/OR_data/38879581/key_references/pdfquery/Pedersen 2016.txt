Background: Ambient air pollution contains low concentrations of carcinogens impli- 
cated in the etiology of urinary bladder cancer (BC). Little is known about whether 
exposure to air pollution influences BC in the general population. 
Objective: To evaluate the association between long-term exposure to ambient air 
pollution and BC incidence. 
Design, setting, and participants: We obtained data from 15 population-based cohorts 
enrolled between 1985 and 2005 in eight European countries (N = 303 431; mean 
follow-up 14.1 yr). We estimated exposure to nitrogen oxides (NO2 and NOx), particulate 
matter (PM) with diameter <10 mm (PM10), <2.5 mm (PM2.5), between 2.5 and 10 mm 
(PM2.5–10), PM2.5 absorbance (soot), elemental constituents of PM, organic carbon, and 
trafﬁc density at baseline home addresses using standardized land-use regression 
models from the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects project. 
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We used Cox proportional-hazards 
models with adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-speciﬁc analyses and 
meta-analyses to estimate summary hazard ratios (HRs) for BC incidence. 
Results and limitations: During follow-up, 943 incident BC cases were diagnosed. In the 
meta-analysis, none of the exposures were associated with BC risk. The summary HRs 
associated with a 10-mg/m3 increase in NO2 and 5-mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 were 0.98 
(95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.89–1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI 0.63–1.18), respectively. 
Limitations include the lack of information about lifetime exposure. 
Conclusions: There was no evidence of an association between exposure to outdoor air 
pollution levels at place of residence and risk of BC. 
Patient summary: We assessed the link between outdoor air pollution at place of 
residence and bladder cancer using the largest study population to date and extensive 
assessment of exposure and comprehensive data on personal risk factors such as 
smoking. We found no association between the levels of outdoor air pollution at place 
of residence and bladder cancer risk.

Urinary bladder cancer (BC) is the ninth most common 
cancer worldwide [1]. Smoking is the primary risk factor for 
BC, with relative risks of three for current smokers and two 
for former smokers compared to individuals who never 
smoked [2]. Findings from the most recent studies suggest 
that the relative risk for current smokers has increased to 
four or five times the risk for nonsmokers [3]. The relative 
risk for BC increases with smoking duration and intensity 
[4]. BC occurs mainly in older people, is more frequent in 
men, and exhibits large geographical variation [5]. 
Ambient air pollution includes a mix of carcinogens such 
as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(PAHs), volatile 
organic compounds, transition metals, and diesel engine 
exhaust [6,7]. Ambient air pollution and particulate matter 
(PM) 
in ambient air have recently been classified as 
carcinogenic to humans [6]. This classification was largely 
based on higher risk of lung cancer [8–10]. However, there is 
suggestive evidence of an association between ambient air 
pollution and BC in humans [6,10]. 
Higher BC risk has been reported in some studies on taxi, 
bus, and/or truck drivers exposed to high levels of urban air 
pollution [6], including PAHs [11] and diesel engine exhaust 
[7], but no risk elevation was found for miners with 
high diesel exposure [12]. Some of these studies were 
incidence-based, while others were based on mortality, 
which may also have contributed to the heterogeneity 
observed for results. A few studies have investigated a 
possible association between exposure to ambient air 
pollution and BC in the general population, and provided 
mixed results [13–17]. Limitations related to design, poor 
exposure assessment, and lack of information on potential 
confounding complicate interpretation of these previous 
studies. 
Our aim was to examine the associations between 
exposure to ambient air pollution at the place of residence 
and BC incidence in a large European study population with 
fine-scale exposure assessment and extensive control for 
potential confounders such as smoking. We used the same 
study population, exposure assessment, and data analysis 
methods as in our previous study documenting significant 
associations between air pollution and lung cancer [9]

meta-analysis for each exposure when it was available in at least three 
cohorts [24]. The I2 statistic and Q test were used to assess heterogeneity 
among cohort-speciﬁc effect estimates [25]. 










































In total, the 15 cohorts contributed 4,275 936 person-years 
at risk, and 943 incident BC cases developed during mean 
follow-up of 14.1 yr (range 0.0–27.0; Table 1). The mean age 
at baseline was 48 yr, ranging from 43 to 57 yr across 
cohorts. Some 39% of the participants were men, 21% were 
current smokers, and 18% were former smokers (Table 1). 
The study areas exhibited a wide range of air pollution 
concentrations between and within each cohort. The 
modeled mean air pollution concentrations were lowest 
in the Swedish and highest in the Italian study areas 
(Table 2, Supplementary Table 3). 


In the meta-analysis, none of the exposures were signifi- 
cantly associated with BC incidence (Table 3, Fig. 2). All 
exposures investigated, including PM elements (Supple- 
mentary Table 4), were associated with HRs close to null. 
The summary HRs in model 3 associated with a 10-mg/m3 
increase in NO2 and 5-mg/m3 increase in PM2.5 were 0.98 
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89–1.08) and 0.86 (95% CI 
0.63–1.18), respectively. 
For all exposures, the summary HRs were essentially 
HR = 1 in models adjusted for age, sex, and calendar year 
only. The HRs were slightly reduced 
in models with 
comprehensive adjustment (Table 3).

Fig. 2 – Risk of bladder cancer associated with ambient air pollution levels in each cohort study and overall. Hazard ratio (data points) and 95% 
confidence interval (lines) for bladder cancer (A) per 10 mg/m3 increment in NO2 and (B) per 5 mg/m3 increment in PM2.5 from models adjusted for age, 
sex, calendar time, smoking (status, intensity, and duration), occupation, employment, education, and area-level socioeconomic status. Grey boxes 
show the weight with which each cohort contributed to the summary hazard ratio. The vertical dashed line shows the summary hazard ratio. 
The meta-analyses showed significant heterogeneity 
between cohorts for PM10, PM2.5–10, and a few elemental 
components of PM, while no substantial heterogeneity was 
observed for most of the exposures assessed (Table 3, Fig. 2, 
Supplementary Table 4). 




In most cohorts, there was no evidence of deviation from 
linearity 
(Supplementary 
Tables 5 and 6). All cohorts met the proportional hazards 
assumptions for Cox models (Supplementary Table 7). 
Higher risk of BC among men was suggested for NO2, 
but 
the effect modification by sex was borderline 


statistically significant and not evident for PM2.5, and 
there was no effect modification by smoking habit and 
education 
(Supplementary 
Table 8). Results reported in Table 3 were similar to 
those in a sensitivity analysis restricted to non-movers, 
models fitted with back-extrapolated exposure to NO2 
and models additionally adjusted for degree of urbaniza- 
tion (Supplementary Table 9). 


In this prospective study of 15 European cohorts, long-term 
exposure to ambient air pollution was not associated with 
risk of BC.

Our study is the largest study with detailed individual- 
level confounder variables to date on the relationship 
between ambient air pollution and BC 
in the general 
population. The lack of an association between air pollution 
and NOx, traffic density, PAHs, and BC risk observed in our 
study 
from 
is consistent with some previous studies 
Denmark, Spain, and 
[13,14,16] and 
inconsistent with others from Spain and Taiwan [14,15]. In- 
consistency among studies may be partly explained by 
differences in design, exposure assessment, and ability to 
adjust for smoking. Only two of the five previous studies 
adjusted for smoking [13,14]. Three case-control studies 
reported higher BC risk in association with crude indicators 
of exposure to outdoor air pollution such as residence in an 
urban area (22–46% [17], 4–63% [14]) and in municipalities 
characterized by high air pollution exposure (36–188% 
[15]). However, residential exposure to specific air pollu- 
tants was not assessed at fine-scale individual levels in four 
of the five previous studies [14–17], the results were not 
consistent within these studies, and nonsignificant results 
for other indicators such as residential proximity to PAH 
emissions or diesel engine exhaust from industries [14] and 
urban residence [15] were reported too. The previous 
studies relying on crude area-specific indicators [14,15,17] 
may have captured differences related to area of living, 
rather than fine-scale, individual-level differences in air 
pollution. 
Similar to tobacco smoke, it is evident that ambient air 
pollution can induce DNA damage in the general population 
[6]. Several studies have linked exposure to ambient air 
pollution to biomarkers of exposure to genotoxic carcino- 
gens and cancer-related early-effect biomarkers, such as 
bulky DNA adducts, chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, 
and DNA methylation [6,26]. Accordingly, carcinogenic 
genotoxic effects may be induced in the urinary bladder by 
exposure to ambient air pollution with particles, providing 
biological plausibility of an association between ambient air 
pollution and BC. 
A major strength of our study is that it relies on 8-yr to 
18-yr mean follow-up for large European population-based 
cohorts spread over a wide geographic area with very 
different air pollution levels, which adds to the generaliz- 
ability of the results. Another important strength is the 
state-of-the-art assessment of quantitative exposure to key 
air pollutants instead of crude indicators of exposure. We 
used a standardized extensive exposure assessment that 
enabled us to assess fine-scale, address-specific, spatial 
variation 
in concentrations of a more comprehensive 
number of air pollutants than 
In 
contrast to any prior studies, we were able to assess PM2.5, 
PM10, PM2.5–10, PM2.5 absorbance, and components of PM. Only 
a case-control study from Taiwan previously evaluated 
exposure to PM10 [15], but this study relied on routine air 
pollution monitoring stations, which do not adequately 
capture within-city exposure variability. Assessment of PM 
is important because PM is considered to be the most 
relevant airborne pollutant for carcinogenesis [8,10]. In- 
deed, our previous analysis showed that higher HRs for lung 
cancer were associated with long-term exposure to PM, but 

not NO2 and NOx [9]. Furthermore, detailed information 
about individual baseline characteristics such as smoking 
habits were available for adjustment. Three of the previous 
five studies [15–17] could not control for smoking. 

Our study has some limitations. The LUR models were 
developed based on measurements and data from 2008 to 
2011, whereas 
to baseline home 
addresses typically 10–15 yr earlier (Table 1). To address 
this discrepancy, we back-extrapolated exposure to the 
baseline period using long-term routine monitoring data, 
which were available for all cohorts except HUBRO, which 
contributed only 2% of the cases. In our study, the meta- 
analysis HRs were not sensitive to back-extrapolation for 
NO2. This approach relied on the assumption that the spatial 
distribution of the determinants of air pollution (eg, traffic, 
land use, and household density) had not changed 
substantially. We believe that the correlations between 
air pollution levels at the baseline residence and concen- 
trations in earlier periods would be high, as it has been 
shown that spatial comparisons of NO2 are stable over time 
[27,28], but we could not back-extrapolate all exposures 
and we recognize the potential for exposure misclassifica- 
tion. Furthermore, exposure at the baseline address does 
not necessarily cover the entire exposure time window of 
relevance for BC development, which seems to range from a 
few years [2] to many decades [13,29] before diagnosis, and 
we might have overlooked an association between exposure 
many decades ago and BC risk. Restriction of the study 
population to those who lived at the baseline address 
throughout follow-up provided similar null results (Sup- 
plementary Table 9). The lack of information on exposure 
before baseline and elsewhere (eg, at work and during 
transport) is a potential source of exposure misclassification 
that may have biased our results 
the null 
hypothesis. We have previously reported an association 
between ambient air pollution and lung cancer using the 
same methodology [9], which supports the notion that this 
method does capture exposures 
for cancer 
development. However, we cannot rule out 
that an 
inadequate follow-up period coupled with some unavoid- 
able misclassification of exposure could have masked any 
low-level BC risk associated with ambient air pollution 
exposure in the general population. It is not possible in this 
study to estimate latency, since exposure, which would 
have begun before baseline, was not estimated in our study. 
Nevertheless, subjects in our study were all aged >40 yr at 
baseline, and thus would have been exposed to air pollution 
for an adequate period of time to demonstrate a higher risk. 
Furthermore, we did find that active smoking recorded at 
baseline in all cohorts was associated with higher BC risk 
(adjusted HR ranging from 1.01 to 1.20 per g/d), which 
suggests that there was adequate follow-up time for these 
cohorts. 


If our study participants had been older at baseline or 
had been followed for a longer time, more BC cases could be 
included to increase the precision of the risk estimates. 
Nonetheless, our study included 941 BC cases and provided 
results with very narrow confidence intervals. We adjusted 
the analyses for a number of potential confounding factors.

The small change in HR after adjustment was mainly due to 
smoking. The potential for residual confounding by smoking 
seems limited, since adjustment only affected HRs moder- 
ately and because similar null results were observed among 
never-smokers (Supplementary Table 8). Information on 
education was not available for the Austrian cohort, which 
contributed a third of the cases in our study. However, for all 
the other cohorts, the HRs associated with PM2.5 and NO2 
exposure were similar with and without adjustment for 
education. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this may have 
caused substantial bias. 
Furthermore, we did not assess effect modification by 
age at diagnosis and stage of disease, so we cannot exclude 
the possibility that the null effect of air pollution was 
impacted by age and/or restriction of the cases series to 
non–muscle-invasive BC. Finally, we cannot exclude con- 
founding from potential risk factors for BC that were 
unaccounted for, such as disinfection by-products [30] or 
arsenic [31] 
in drinking water. Future studies should 
consider evaluation of polycyclic aromatic amines, which 
was not possible in our study. 


In conclusion, this large prospective study does not provide 
evidence of an association between ambient air pollution at 
place of residence and BC incidence.
