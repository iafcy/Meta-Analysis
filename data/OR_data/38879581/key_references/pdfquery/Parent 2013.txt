ABSTRACT 
Objectives There is a paucity of information on 
environmental risk factors for prostate cancer. We 
conducted a case–control study in Montreal to estimate 
associations with exposure to ground-level nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), a marker for trafﬁc-related air pollution. 
Methods Cases were 803 men with incident prostate 
cancer, ≤75 years of age, and diagnosed across all 
French hospitals in Montreal. Concurrently, 969 controls 
were drawn from electoral lists of French-speaking 
individuals residing in the same electoral districts as the 
cases and frequency-matched by age. Concentrations of 
NO2 were measured across Montreal in 2005–2006. We 
developed a land use regression model to predict 
concentrations of NO2 across Montreal for 2006. These 
estimates were back-extrapolated to 1996. Estimates 
were linked to residential addresses at the time of 
diagnosis or interview. Unconditional logistic regression 
was used, adjusting for potential confounding variables. 
Results For each increase of 5 parts per billion of NO2, 
as estimated from the original land use regression model 
in 2006, the OR5ppb adjusted for personal factors was 
1.44 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). Adding in contextual 
factors attenuated the OR5ppb to 1.27 (95% CI 1.03 to 
1.58). One method for back-extrapolating concentrations 
of NO2 to 1996 (about 10 years before the index date) 
gave the following OR5ppb: 1.41 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.62) 
when personal factors were included, and 1.30 (95% CI 
1.11 to 1.52) when contextual factors were added. 
Conclusions Exposure to ambient concentrations of 
NO2 at the current address was associated with an 
increased risk of prostate cancer. This novel ﬁnding 
requires replication. 
INTRODUCTION 
Prostate cancer has the highest incidence of all 
tumours among Canadian men, with an estimated 
26 500 new cases in 2012.1 Age-adjusted incidence 
rates have remained stable over the last decade, 
while mortality rates have declined somewhat. 
Similar patterns have been observed in several 
other countries.2 
The incidence of prostate cancer increases expo- 
nentially with age, 
is higher among men with a 
ﬁrst-degree relative affected by the disease, and 
varies by geography and ancestry.3 4 There are no 
accepted modiﬁable risk factors for this cancer. 
Evidence from migrant studies suggests that envir- 
onmental inﬂuences may be implicated in its aeti- 
ology.5

circumstances and smoking have been investigated, 
but no clear signal has emerged.2 
Local vehicular trafﬁc in urban areas is a primary 
contributor to air pollution. Vehicular emissions 
include gases, particles, volatile organic compounds 
(PAHs). 
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
Some constituents are recognised carcinogens (eg, 
benzene) and may have hormone-modulating prop- 
erties.6 Little is known about the role of air pollu- 
tion in prostate cancer. Two ecological studies of 
air pollution conducted in the USA in the 1960s, 
one in Erie County, New York7 and the other in 
Nashville, Tennessee,8 found positive associations 
with prostate cancer mortality, while a recent 
cohort study from Denmark found no association 
with the incidence of prostate cancer.9 

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been shown to be a 
trafﬁc-related pollution.10–12 
good marker 
Similar to the approach used by us in another 
study,13–15 our objective was to determine whether 
trafﬁc-related air pollution was associated with inci- 
dent prostate cancer. 
METHODS 
We restricted the population to French-speaking 
men living on the Island of Montreal and Nuns’ 
Island, which have a population of approximately 
1.8 million people.16 Over 86% of the population 
on the Island of Montreal speak French. 
Study population 
The Prostate Cancer and Environment Study 
(PROtEuS) is a case–control study of environmental 
risk factors for prostate cancer. Study subjects were 
men, under 76 years of age at the time of diagnosis 
or selection, residents of the greater Montreal area, 
listed on the Province of Quebec’s permanent elect- 
oral list (continually updated) and Canadian citi- 
zens. Cases were actively ascertained through 
pathology departments across all 11 French hospi- 
tals, of the total of 14 hospitals that diagnose pros- 
tate cancer in the Montreal area. We included all 
patients diagnosed with primary, histologically con- 
ﬁrmed prostate cancer (International Classiﬁcation 
of Diseases, 10th revision, code C61) between 
September 2005 and June 2008. Control subjects 
were selected concurrently from the population- 
based provincial electoral French-speaking list, and 
frequency-matched to cases by 5-year age groups. 
The electoral list is thought to represent a nearly 
complete listing of Canadian citizens residing in the 
province of Quebec. Controls were drawn ran- 
domly from an area comprising 39 electoral 







districts (about 40 000 electors each), corresponding to those of 
the case series. Subjects were still eligible if they had a history of 
cancer other than prostate cancer. 
Data collection 
As part of face-to-face interviews, participants provided infor- 
mation about socio-demographic characteristics, a wide range of 
lifestyle-related factors, a prostate cancer screening history and 
detailed occupational histories. The degree of aggressiveness of 
prostate cancers, as deﬁned by the Gleason score (http:// 
gleasonscore.net/), was extracted from pathology reports. Ethics 
committees at all participating institutions approved the proto- 
col and subjects provided informed consent. 
Assessment of exposure to trafﬁc-related air pollution 
Findings from our sampling survey of ambient concentrations of 
NO2 conducted in Montreal in 2005 and 2006 were reported 
previously.14 NO2 is recognised as a marker of trafﬁc-related pol- 
lution due in part to its co-locational association with other pol- 
lutants.10–12 NO2 is a near-source exhaust dilution pollutant that 
is formed within seconds and metres of emission from vehicles, 
and so can be used as a marker of trafﬁc-related air pollution. It 
correlates with elemental carbon (a product of combustion) and 
with distance from roadways, and studies of areas with high 
trafﬁc density show some of the highest levels of NO2 compared 
to other locations where there is no trafﬁc.11 Although NO2 has 
a regional component, measurement close to the surface of roads 
will measure mostly trafﬁc-related sources. A number of Dutch 
studies have shown correlations with elemental carbon and with 
distance from roadways.11 NO2 is the most widely used marker 
for trafﬁc-related air pollution: in a review paper, Hoek et al12 
showed that in 18 cities where it has been measured, roadways, 
trafﬁc, and truck routes were all important predictors.12 
Brieﬂy, the locations for the samplers were selected using a 
location-allocation model that placed samplers in areas likely to 
have high spatial variability in trafﬁc-related pollution and high 
population densities.17 Samplers were deployed at 133 locations 
on roadside utility poles, approximately 3 m above the ground, 
across the Island of Montreal on three occasions (spring, summer, 
winter) to obtain 2-week integrated samples. We used Ogawa 
passive diffusion samplers that use triethanolamine-impregnated 
ﬁlters as an absorbent. Valid observations at 129 locations were 
obtained from all three sampling periods. 
We used these observations to develop a land use regression 
model to predict concentrations of mean annual NO2 for 2005– 
2006, at a resolution of 5 m2 across the Island of Montreal.14 
We modelled the natural logarithm of NO2 on land use and 
trafﬁc-related variables to generate an exposure surface (R2 = 
0.80). We found that the most important predictors were trafﬁc 
counts, major roads, and other land use associated with trafﬁc. 
In addition, the highest values were found along the major road- 
ways and highways in the city. 
Residential addresses, at the time of diagnosis for cases and at 
the time of interview for controls, were then linked to the 
exposure surface. Eighty-seven per cent of subjects included in 
the present analysis were geocoded to the x,y coordinates of 
their home address and 13% were geocoded to the centroid of 
the area represented by the six-character postal code, which in 
Montreal usually refers to a block face or to a large apartment 
complex. 
Historical estimates of exposure 
We developed three separate but related methods15 to back- 
extrapolate our exposure surface to 1996 using measurements 
of ambient NO2 from 12 ﬁxed-site monitoring stations of 
Environment Canada’s National Air Pollution Surveillance 
network. These measurements of NO2 were used to produce 
location-speciﬁc ratios that would scale the 2006 surface, using 
three related back-extrapolation methods15: for method 1, we 
used inverse distance weighting on the mean annual concentra- 
tions at the ﬁxed-site stations to interpolate the spatial surfaces, 
while for methods 2 and 3 we made use of land use regression 
models to produce the surfaces. 
Method 1 
For method 1, we divided the interpolated surface from the 
ﬁxed-site monitors in 1996 by the interpolated surface for 
2006. We then multiplied our original 
land use regression 
model by this ratio to produce a surface of estimated annual 
mean concentrations of NO2 for 1996. 
Method 2 
For method 2, we used land use regression models to create two 
surfaces to form the ratio. The numerator was computed by 
regressing the observed annual concentrations of NO2 at the 12 
ﬁxed-site monitors in 1996 against a reduced set of spatial vari- 
ables that were used in the land use regression model of 2006. 
For the denominator, we used as the dependent variable pre- 
dicted concentrations at the 12 ﬁxed-site monitors from the 
land use regression model of 2006, and then regressed these 
predicted values against the same covariates that were selected 
for the numerator. We then formed the ratio of the 1996 to the 
2006 newly developed surfaces and multiplied by the land use 
regression surface of 2006. 
Method 3 
For method 3, we applied the regression coefﬁcients of an alter- 
native land use regression model for 2006 (R2=0.65) to land 
use and trafﬁc variables measured in 1996. This alternative 
model was developed because not all spatial variables used in 
2006 were available for 1996. As in method 2, we then multi- 
plied this alternative model by the ratio of two additional 
models: for the numerator we used as dependent variables 
observed values at the 12 stations in 1996, and for the denom- 
inator we used predicted values from the alternative land use 
regression model at the same 12 locations. 
Using back-extrapolation methods similar to those for 1996, 
we also developed a set of historical exposure estimates for 
1985 based on 10 ﬁxed-site monitors. Considering the 
unknown proportion of subjects who would have lived in 1985 
at an address other than the one they had in 2006, as well as 
the probable lower reliability of estimates for 1985, the latter 
are treated here as sensitivity analyses. 
Statistical analysis 
Our main analyses focused on the recent exposure estimates 
(2006) and the back-extrapolated estimates of exposure 10 years 
earlier (1996). We used unconditional logistic regression to esti- 
mate OR and 95% CI between exposure to NO2 and the risk of 
developing prostate cancer. We included continuous covariates 
as linear terms or as natural cubic spline functions if the 
response was non-linear. Individual-level covariates considered 
included age, ﬁrst-degree family history of prostate cancer, 
ancestry, family income, body mass index and attained level of 
education, but not all of these were included in the ﬁnal 
models, as some variables did not show associations. 
We postulated that neighbourhood deprivation, a contextual 
factor, may be associated with prostate cancer and may 







confound associations with air pollution because deprived popu- 
lations often live in areas that are characterised by higher con- 
centrations of air pollution.18 19 There is no information, 
however, as to whether these variables are causally associated 
with prostate cancer or are surrogates for other causal factors. 
We made use of Canadian census tract data from 1996 to 
describe the socio-economic characteristics of Montreal’s neigh- 
bourhoods according to the address at the index date. Variables 
describing median household income and percentage of adults 
who did not complete high school were compiled for the 350 
census tracts that included addresses of subjects (heretofore 
referred to as neighbourhood ecologic covariates). 
Standard regression diagnostics were applied to identify pos- 
sible inﬂuential subjects and to ensure that the models did not 
violate the assumptions of the logistic models. Potential effect- 
modiﬁcation according to all of the covariates was evaluated. 
We included NO2 as a continuous, linear variable after verify- 
ing this assumption through the use of b-spline functions (2 
the ﬁtted 
degrees of 
exposure–response curves. ORs are presented for each increase 
in exposure to NO2 of 5 parts per billion ( ppb), referred to as 
OR5ppb. 



Sensitivity analyses 
We conducted analyses using estimates back-extrapolated to 
1985. In addition, we considered the potential confounding 
effects of smoking and alcohol consumption where we assessed 
the effect of status (never smoked/drank, ex-smoker/drinker, 
current 
indices of cumulative 
smoking and alcohol consumption. We also compared the 
results for subjects who were geo-coded to x,y coordinates and 
those who were geocoded to the centroid of the area repre- 
sented by the six-character postal code. Separate analyses were 
carried out among those subjects for whom we had information 
on duration of residence, restricting to those who had been resi- 
dents at the same address for 10 or more years prior to inter- 
view. We also investigated whether severity of prostate cancer, 
and whether restricting subjects to those who had been screened 
for prostate cancer, affected the estimates. Lastly, we determined 
whether response patterns had any substantial effect on the 
ﬁndings. 
RESULTS 
Although 1260 prostate cancer cases and 1535 controls from 
the Greater Montreal area had been interviewed at the time of 
analysis, we had spatial estimates of air pollution only for the 
Island of Montreal and Nuns’ Island. We thus excluded 457 
prostate cases and 566 controls who lived in outlying regions, 
thereby leaving 803 cases and 969 controls for the present ana- 
lyses. The mean (SD) age of cases and controls was 65 (7) years. 
Response rates were 86% for cases and 63% for controls. 
Reasons for non-participation among cases were refusal (94%), 
unable to trace (3%), death with no proxy available (2%) and 
language 
non- 
participation was attributable to refusal (86%), unable to trace 
(11%), language barrier (1%), death with no proxy available 
(1%) and too sick with no proxy available (1%). Proxy respon- 
dents provided information for 3% and 5% of cases and con- 
trols, respectively. Table 1 shows the distributions of recognised 
and selected potential risk factors for prostate cancer and asso- 
ciated age-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. A ﬁrst-degree family 
history of prostate cancer conferred a twofold increase in risk. 
Compared to men of French ancestry, men of African descent 
had higher risks, while men of Asian descent had lower risks of 




developing prostate cancer. Men who only completed primary 
school had higher risks than all others. There was little differ- 
ence between groups on body mass index, smoking, alcohol 
intake, proxy responses and annual family income. 
We estimated age-adjusted ORs for the three ecological cov- 
ariates acting as possible confounding variables; that is, median 
household income, percentage of recent immigrants and per- 
centage of adults who did not complete high school (the ﬁrst 
two were modelled as natural cubic splines on 2 degrees of 
freedom). We observed an inverse association with median 
household income and found higher risks as the proportion of 
individuals without a high school education increased. Higher 
risks were found amongst men in the third quartile of the distri- 
bution of recent immigrants. 
Associations with estimates of concentrations of 
ground-level NO2 
Concentrations of NO2 decreased from a mean of 43.2 mg/m3 
in 1985 to 25.7 mg/m3 in 2009, a 41% reduction. Table 2 
shows that the mean concentrations of NO2 estimated from our 
original land-use regression (2006) were 12.4 ppb amongst cases 
and 11.8 ppb amongst controls. Making use of our three back- 
extrapolation methods, mean concentrations 
in 1996 were 
between 17.5 ppb and 17.8 ppb amongst cases and between 
16.4 ppb and 16.9 ppb amongst controls. 
The surfaces that we used also reﬂected a narrowing of the 
distributions of NO2 over time. We found positive correlations 
between 1000 randomly sampled locations on the different 
exposure surfaces (Pearson correlation coefﬁcients: 0.96–0.99) 
and observed annual mean concentrations of NO2 at the ﬁxed- 
site stations for 1985, 1996 and 2006 suggesting that the spatial 
patterns of NO2 did not vary importantly during the 20-year 
period between 1985 and 2006. Furthermore, the observed 
concentrations at the locations of the ﬁxed-site monitoring sta- 
tions in 2006 were correlated with those in 1996 (r=0.89, 95% 
CI 0.60 to 0.97) and in 1985 (r=0.72, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94; 
see online supplementary eTable 1 and eFigure 1). Table 3 
shows OR5ppb for prostate cancer adjusted for age only, adjusted 
for age and personal covariates, and adjusted for these variables 
and the three ecological variables. Personal covariates included 
age (linear), ﬁrst-degree family history of prostate cancer (yes, 
no, don’t know), ancestry (French, African, Asian, other, 
unknown) and attained level of education (six categories). 
Family income and body mass index were not retained in the 
models as they were not associated with the risk of prostate 
cancer. There were no inﬂuential observations in these or any 
other analyses. 
We did not ﬁnd any evidence of non-linearity in the response 
functions for NO2 (see online supplementary eFigure 2) and we 
thus present ORs for each increase of 5 ppb in NO2 making use 
of the land use regression map developed in 2005–2006 (essen- 
tially the index date period) as well as the three methods of 
back-extrapolation to 1996. There were minimal differences 
between OR5ppb adjusted only for age and those also adjusted 
for selected personal factors. The OR5ppb using NO2 evaluated 
in 2006 using our original land use regression model was 1.44 
(95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). It was attenuated to 1.27 (95% CI 1.03 
factors were included. 
to 1.58) when the three ecological 
Median household income was the only ecological factor that 
attenuated the ORs and inclusion of personal income did not 
affect the risk estimates (data not shown). For the period about 
the 
10 years before the index date (1996), 
fully-adjusted OR5ppb was between 1.23 and 1.38, attenuated 
from those of 2006.

Sensitivity analyses 
For 1985, the fully-adjusted OR5ppb varied between 1.11 and 
1.17 (see online supplementary eTable 3). The OR5ppb tended 
to be somewhat higher when analyses were restricted to cases 
with a Gleason score <7, as compared to those with a Gleason 
score ≥7 (considered to indicate aggressive cancer), but CIs 
overlapped. For example, the fully-adjusted OR5ppb associated 
with our original land use model (2006) were 1.41 (95% CI 
1.07 to 1.86) and 1.23 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.58) for non- 
aggressive and aggressive cancers, respectively. 
Additional analyses excluded proxy subjects and included 
smoking ( pack-years) and alcohol (drink-years) in the models, 
entered as continuous covariates using natural cubic splines on 4 
and 2 degrees of freedom, but this did not alter the results (data 
not shown). There was no evidence of effect modiﬁcation 
according to any of the covariates (data not shown). 
We conducted analyses restricting to subjects who reported 
that they had been screened for prostate cancer within the previ- 
ous 5 years (prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) test and/or a digital 
in order to reduce the possibility of 
rectal examination), 
undiagnosed prostate cancer in the control series (see online 
supplementary eTable 4). There were few differences from the 
main analyses. 
A separate analysis restricted subjects to those who lived at 
the same address for 10 or more years at the time of diagnosis 
for cases and at the time of interview for controls. This analysis 
is limited because we did not start asking this question until well 
into the data collection, and it is based on only 71 cases and 
223 controls. About 70% of subjects for whom duration of resi- 
dency at the current address was collected had lived there for at 
least 10 years. For the original land use model, we found among 
those subjects who had lived in their homes for 10 years an 
OR5ppb of 1.36 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.45) and adding in the eco- 
logical covariates attenuated this to 1.13 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.29), 
compatible with our main ﬁndings (see online supplementary 
eTable 5). 
Analyses comparing whether the address was geocoded dir- 
ectly to x,y coordinates (1522 subjects) or to the centroid of the 
six-character postal code (250 subjects) generated fairly similar 
results (see online supplementary eTable 6).

Non-participants were generally similar to participants, with a 
slight trend towards non-participants living in areas with a greater 
proportion of recent immigrants within the previous 10 years, 
with a higher unemployment rate, with a greater proportion of 
adults without a high school diploma, and with a lower median 
household income (data not shown). These ﬁndings are consistent 
with the absence of major socio-economic disparities between sub- 
jects who participated in the study and those who did not. We also 
carried out an analysis that included all eligible cases and controls, 
including non-participants, to evaluate the potential impact of 
non-participation. While we had no information on personal cov- 
ariates for non-participants, we found similar results when adjust- 
ing only for age and slightly attenuated ORs after including the 
ecological variables (data not shown). 
DISCUSSION 
Our ﬁndings showed increased risks of incident prostate cancer 
among men exposed to higher concentrations of NO2, a marker 
of trafﬁc-related air pollution. These ﬁndings are novel and sur- 
prising. As discussed below, associations persisted when we con- 
sidered potential alternate explanations and sensitivity analyses, 
but we are cautious in interpreting the results. 
Local, national and international geographical variations in 
patterns of occurrence of prostate cancer are one of its most 
puzzling characteristics. Identiﬁcation of modiﬁable risk factors 
for this disease has remained largely unsuccessful and the use of 
spatially referenced data represents a potentially fruitful avenue 
for research.20 
Combustion engines produce thousands of compounds, 
including ﬁne particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon mon- 
oxide, PAHs and volatile organic compounds.21 The magnitude 
of the risk estimates varied somewhat when estimates of expos- 
ure from different 
time periods were used. We found the 
highest risks for recent estimates of pollution but also found 
slightly increased risks for more remote estimates. It is likely 
that the back-extrapolated estimates of exposure entailed more 
misclassiﬁcation than the original land use model, and this may 
explain the observed reductions in relative risks. 
Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution entails potential 
exposure to a wide range of chemicals or compounds and it has 
been associated with several health effects.22 23 With respect to 
cancer, there is strong evidence of an association with lung 
cancer.23 For prostate cancer, only a few studies have been con- 
ducted. In two ecological studies conducted on suspended parti- 
cles in the USA in the 1960s, one by Winkelstein and Kantor7 in 
Erie County, New York and the other by Hagstrom et al8 in 
Nashville, Tennessee, associations were observed with prostate 
cancer mortality. In one other study, increased mortality from 
prostate cancer was found to be associated with residential prox- 
imity to metal industrial facilities,24 while in another investiga- 
tion, a slightly higher incidence of prostate cancer was reported 
among men living near a major airport.25 More recently, 
Raaschou-Nielsen et al9 as part of the Diet, Cancer and Health 
cohort study in Denmark, made use of modelled concentrations 
of NOx at residences and reported associations with cervical 
and brain cancer incidence but not with prostate cancer (HR of 
0.96 per an increase of 100 μg/m3 of NOx; 673 cases). 
There is clearly insufﬁcient information to make any informed 
judgments regarding whether air pollution causes prostate cancer, 
and our ﬁndings could be due to chance. The prostate cancer car- 
cinogenesis process is poorly understood and we believe that it is 
premature to speculate at length on potential mechanisms. A 
number of occupational studies have provided some information 
on occupational circumstances that may increase the risk of devel- 
oping prostate cancer. In two reviews, the following occupational 
factors were identiﬁed as possibly associated with this cancer: 
farming, pesticides and herbicides, cadmium, mineral oils, metal 
working-related exposures, and PAHs and engine emissions.26 27 
In a few studies using substance-based exposure assessment proto- 
cols, increased risks of prostate cancer have been observed among 
men occupationally exposed to PAHs from coal28 and diesel 
fumes,29 but these ﬁndings have not been replicated in other 
studies.30 31 While several chemicals may cause endocrine disrup- 
tion or modulation32 33 and might relate to the development of 
prostate cancer,6 the hormonal hypothesis remains unconﬁrmed. 
Of course, many of the compounds in ambient air, such as PAHs, 
may act directly as carcinogens. 

the present analysis provides only 
partial information on personal exposure to air pollution. Total 
personal exposure is related to a number of factors, including 
daily activity patterns and amount of time spent indoors and 
outdoors, among others. Two limitations of using the home

address as a surrogate of exposure are thus related to population 
mobility: people do not necessarily live in the same home over 
the course of their lifetime nor do they spend all of their time at 
home. While it is true that many subjects may spend their days 
away from home, a study by Leech et al34 found that Canadian 
adults spend on average ∼67–68% of 
their time at home 
(indoors and outdoors combined). Our analysis restricted to 
subjects who lived for 10 or more years at the current address 
were compatible with our primary results. 
Given some imprecision associated with geocoded addresses 
and other geographical data, as well as the fact that we used spa- 
tially derived exposures as surrogates for personal exposures, 
the risk estimates presented here are clearly misclassiﬁed. Thus, 
our results may underestimate the true estimates of the relative 
risk of prostate cancer associated with exposure to air pollution 
in this population. 
We could not assess associations with early life exposures, nor 
do we know what age periods may be critical in the induction 
of cancer. However, sensitivity analyses suggested that risks 
were slightly elevated using exposure estimates pertaining to 
25 years before interview. Further work is needed to verify 
whether these results represent true associations or whether 
they are due to chance or to undetected bias. Our ﬁndings 
should not be interpreted as meaning that NO2 might be a 
causal factor; should the association with NO2 be conﬁrmed, it 
would more likely reﬂect an association with the complex 
mixture that is derived from the combustion of hydrocarbons.35 
This study focuses on the majority French-speaking popula- 
tion in Montreal. Cases were ascertained across all French hos- 
pitals, covering over 80% of all cases in the region. In order to 
reduce 
selected 
French-speaking controls who came from the same areas of the 
city as the cases. A comparison of the distribution of residential 
postal codes amongst cases and controls indeed conﬁrmed that 
both groups resided in the same geographical areas. Access to 
medical care is entirely free across all Montreal hospitals, and it 
is reasonable to assume that French-speaking controls would be 
referred to the French-speaking hospitals where the cases arose. 
Response rates were relatively high among cases (86%) and lower 
among controls (63%). Our analysis based on all eligible subjects 
suggests that differential response rates did not substantially alter 
the risks. Inﬂated estimates of risk may be expected if, for example, 
controls with higher educational levels responded more frequently 
than the target population and if higher concentrations of air pollu- 
tion are inversely associated with higher educational levels.18 





Cancer screening practices are an important issue in studies of 
prostate cancer. In this study population, prostate cancer screen- 
ing was widespread. In the 5 years preceding the index date, 
about 40% of cases and the same proportion of controls had 
been PSA-tested between one and four times, and 36.0% of 
cases and 47.1% of controls had had ﬁve PSA tests, what could 
be considered to be the equivalent of about one routine PSA 
test each year, on average, which corresponds to common prac- 
tice in Montreal. Nearly all 
(98.8%) cases reported being 
screened (PSA test and/or digital rectal examination), while 
75.2% of controls reported being screened in the 2 years before 
the index date. It may well be that some of the recent screening 
tests reported by cases were in fact diagnostic tests based on 
symptoms, but we have no information to verify this. 
Sub-analyses restricting controls to those men who reported 
having been screened for prostate cancer in the previous 5 years 
yielded results similar to those from the main analyses. 
We observed associations previously conﬁrmed in population- 
based studies, such as higher risks among men of African 
lower risks among those of Asian descent, and an 
descent, 
risk with a ﬁrst-degree family history of prostate 
excess 
cancer.36 37 It is possible that the observed associations reﬂect a 
role for an aetiological factor correlated with trafﬁc-related pol- 
lution and unaccounted for in our analyses. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Exposures to ambient concentrations of NO2 at the current 
address were associated with an increased risk of incident pros- 
tate cancer. Should trafﬁc-related air pollution prove to be 
causal, it could explain a large proportion of new cases. It is 
thus essential that other independent studies be conducted.
