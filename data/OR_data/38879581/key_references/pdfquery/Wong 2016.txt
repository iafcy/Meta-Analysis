Background—Few studies have assessed long-term effects of particular matter with 
aerodynamic diameter < 2.5μm (PM 2.5) on mortality for causes of cancer other than the lung; we 
assessed the effects on multiple causes. In Hong Kong most people live and work in urban or 
suburban areas with high-rise buildings. This facilitates estimation of PM2.5 exposure of 
individuals taking into account height of residence above ground level for assessment of the long- 
term health effects with sufficient statistical power. 
Methods—We recruited 66,820 persons who were ≥65 in 1998-2001 and followed up for 
mortality outcomes till 2011. Annual concentrations of PM at their residential addresses were 
estimated using PM2.5 concentrations measured at fixed-site monitors, horizontal-vertical 
locations, and satellite data. We used Cox regression model to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of 
mortality for cancer per 10 μg/m 3 increase of PM2.5. 
Results—PM2.5 was associated with increased risk of mortality for all causes of cancer (HR 1.22 
[95% CI: 1.11–1.34]), and for specific cause of cancer in upper digestive tract (1.42 [1.06–1.89]), 
digestive accessory organs (1.35 [1.06–1.71]), in all subjects; breast (1.80 [1.26–2.55]) in females; 
lung (1.36 [1.05–1.77]) in males. 
Conclusions—Long-term exposures to PM2.5 is associated with elevated risks of cancer at 
various organs. 
Impact—This study is particularly timely in China where compelling evidence is needed to 
support pollution control policy to ameliorate the health damages associated with economic 
growth.

Emissions from transportation and power generation are the major sources of carcinogenic 
hydrocarbons and heavy metals in particulate matter (PM) (1). Long-term exposure to PM 
has been associated with mortality mainly from cardiopulmonary causes and lung cancer but 
there have been few studies showing an association with mortality from other cancers (2– 
11). Two main biological mechanisms to explain PM-associated cancer mortality have been 
postulated: first an effect of oxidative stress induced by PM on epithelial cells to produce 
reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA, proteins and lipids (12); and second an effect 
of inflammation induced directly or indirectly by PM leading to production of chemokines 
and cytokines to trigger angiogenesis allowing epithelial invasion of metastatic tumor cells 
and then survival of the invading malignant cells in distant organs (13). It is plausible that 
PM-associated carcinogenic risk could appear in organs other than the nasal cavities and 
lungs but there are few epidemiological studies addressing the postulation. This was a 
prospective cohort study; the methods before taking into account of floor level in estimation 
of the exposure and results on mortality for all-natural and cardio-respiratory causes have 
been published (14). In this study we assessed associations of mortality for various causes of 
cancer with long-term exposure to PM. 


18 Elderly Health Centres were established to deliver health examinations and primary care 
services for older adults in Hong Kong by the Elderly Health Service of the Department of 
Health of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, that aimed to 
promote the health of elderly population in each district and to enhance selfcare ability so as 
to minimize illness and disability. Nurses and doctors of the Elderly Health Centre that 
located in each of the 18 districts in Hong Kong provides health assessment, using 
standardized and structured interviews, and comprehensive clinical examinations. 
Information on socio-demographic, lifestyles, and disease history was collected, as 
described in a previous study using the data collected by the Elderly Health Service (15). 
This study covered all 66,820 enrollees from July 1998 to December 2001, which was 
recruited on voluntary basis, accounting for 9% of the 65 or older population at the baseline 
year (the sampling fractions ranging from 6.6 to 17.5% of the population older than 65 years 
of age in each district) (16). The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster and the ethics 
committee of the Department of Health. 

Vital status and causes of death was ascertained by record linkage to death registration in 
Hong Kong using the unique Hong Kong identity card number. The last date of follow-up or 



censor date was December 31, 2011. Causes of death were routinely coded using 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9th Revision before 2001 and 10th Revision 
in or after 2001. Most of the Hong Kong residents died in hospital, ensuring accurate 
ascertainment of cause of death. Those whose vital status could not be determined were 
assumed to be alive. 

The cause of death was coded by both ICD-9 and ICD-10 over the study period from 1998, 
and was based on the underlying cause of death according to the underlying etiology or 
injury that initiated the chain of morbid events leading directly to death. The mortality 
causes considered in this study were subcategories of cancer, which accounted for at least 
100 deaths. They were: all malignant neoplasms or cancers ICD10:C00-C99 (or 
ICD9:140-209). Subcategories of cancers included were: all digestive organs C15-C26 
(150-159) which was subdivided into (i) upper digestive tract C15-16 (150-151) including 
esophagus and stomach, (ii) lower digestive tract C17-21 (152-154) including small 
intestine, colon, rectum, appendix, and anus, and (iii) accessory organs C22-25 (155-157) 
including liver, gall bladder and pancreas; lung including trachea C33-C34 (162); breast C50 
(174); female genital C51-C58 (179-184); male genital C60-C63 (185-187); urinary C64- 
C68 (188-189); and lympho-hematopoietic C81-C96 (200-209). To assess the specificity, we 
assessed the causes of poisoning and injuries (S00–Y98) mortality which was considered to 
be unrelated to PM exposure. 

On the basis of the data from a standardized questionnaire, we included individual covariates 
of age, gender, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, exercise frequency, education level, 
and personal monthly expenditure. On the basis of census statistics in 197 land areas, by the 
Tertiary Planning Units (16), we included ecological covariates in percentage of older 
subjects (aged 65+), percentage with tertiary education and monthly domestic household 
income. From 18 districts of Hong Kong, we included environmental covariates in 
percentage of smokers (aged 15+) for indication of exposure to environmental tobacco 
smoke in each year. On the basis of ad hoc survey, we included ground radon levels 
(kBqm-3) in 1×1 km grid of a data map (17–19). 

We calculated annual mean concentrations (μg/m 3) of particulate matter with aerodynamic 
diameter < 2.5 um (PM2.5) based on data from 5 stations run by the Environmental 
Protection Department which has monitored hourly concentrations of the pollutants by 
tapered element oscillating microbalance from 1998 until 2011. In all the locations, we 
obtained their geospatial height above the mean sea level and the satellite information in 1×1 
km grids of surface extinction coefficients (20–22). Then we fitted regression models to 
estimate PM2.5 concentrations using surface extinction coefficients and inverse geospatial 
height (i.e. 1/height) of the residential location above the mean sea level as independent 
variables. 



We geocoded all residential addresses of the subjects, and matched them with the surface 
extinction coefficients data. We calculated the vertical height of each address based on the 
floor number. Using the above mentioned exposure model, we estimated the annual mean 
concentrations of PM2.5 in each residential location. We then compared the estimates with 
the results independently obtained from a deterministic model based on street canyon 
geometry, traffic census, air pollution, and meteorological data for an area where the data 
were available (23). 

For each organ-specific cancer mortality data set, we used Cox proportional hazards model 
to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality (n=60,273) for every 10 μg/m 3 increase of 
long-term exposure to PM2.5 concentration with adjustment for individual, ecological and 
environmental covariates after excluding subjects (9.8%) with missing data in any covariates 
that were previously mentioned. We used time-on-study from the baseline as timescale and 
the estimated exposure in the subjects' recruitment year (between 1998 and 2001) to 
represent long-term exposure. To control for competing diseases and to assure detection of 
long-term associations, we excluded deaths due to other causes and deaths that occurred 
within 3 years from the baseline year respectively. We stratified the data by ever and never 
smoker and tested for the difference by an interaction term in the model, respectively for 
male and female. We performed the sensitivity analysis by excluding height of address from 
sea level in the exposure estimation, by using current annual mean PM2.5 as time-varying 
variable in the Cox model, and by competing risks model instead of excluding deaths from 
competing causes (24), or by excluding subjects with self-reported pre-existing respiratory 
and cardio-metabolic diseases at baseline. Death records were the primary follow-up 
information in this study (with average of 10.3 years and range 0-13 years of follow-up) but 
those which might have lost to follow-up due to change in address or migration were not 
traceable. Among the non-missing records until the last follow-up year, there were 16% of 
them who did not appear in any formal records of adverse health events nor in any 
questionnaire interviews in the last 3 years, which might be due to loss to follow-up. 
Therefore we also performed the sensitivity analysis by excluding these 16% potential loss 
to follow-up subjects from the analysis. Further sensitivity analyses were perform to exclude 
deaths within 5 or 7 years, subjects who had moved during the follow-up period or had been 
hospitalized during 1998-2000, to take account of diseases which may take longer than 3 
years for the incubation period, the effect of moving address and the effect of mixing with 
prevalent cases, respectively. Cox models were performed using the command PHREG in 
Statistical Analysis System (SAS) 9.2. We plotted the relationship between PM2.5 and deaths 
from all cancers using the natural splines command COXPH in R 3.0.1 with two degrees of 
freedom. As a sensitivity analysis, we also used models with random effects set at the 
intercepts to take account of possible intra-district correlations (25, 26). 

In the exposure models for PM2.5 (R2=0.47) both inverse height (p<0.001) and surface 
extinction coefficients (p<0.01) were significant predictors. Comparison of the empirically 
estimated PM concentrations with those estimated from deterministic model for street 



canyon yielded good validation measures (Supplementary Table S1). The estimated PM2.5 
mean concentration (2.5 – 97.5 percentile) in the baseline year at individual residential 
locations was 33.7 (29.5–39.8) μg/m 3 (Figure 1). 
Subjects who were exposed to cleaner air quality tended to be younger, have a higher BMI 
and be never-smokers, frequent exercisers, better educated, lower in personal expenditure, 
and be located in areas with fewer older people, higher levels of education, higher income 
and higher radon levels (all P Values<0.01). Significant covariates identified in the Cox 
regression model of cancer mortality were older, male, underweight, ever smoked, less 
educated, and lived in a community with younger, less educated and with more smoking 
subjects (Table 1). 
PM2.5 was associated with all-cancer mortality (HR = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
1.11, 1.34) as well as cause-specific cancer mortality including all digestive organs (HR = 
1.22, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.42), upper digestive tract (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.89), and 
accessory digestive organs (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.71). In female, the associations were 
shown in breast (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.26, 2.55) and genital organs (HR = 1.73, 95% CI: 
1.17, 2.54) (Table 2). PM2.5 was not significantly (P>0.05) associated with external causes. 
A linear concentration-response relationship between PM2.5 and all-cancer mortality was 
shown (Figure 2). 
In the stratified analysis, PM2.5 (per 10 μg/m 3 increase) was associated with mortality due to 
lung cancers (HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.77) among male subgroup (Table 3). The HRs in 
the sensitivity analyses (Table 4) were consistent to those in the main analyses in terms of 
magnitude and direction of deviation from the null effect estimate. 

We showed that in older people, cancer mortality risks were associated with long-term 
exposure to particulate air pollutants in a typical Asian city, Hong Kong, where the people 
dwell mainly in high-rise buildings. We demonstrated carcinogenic risks of PM2.5 in 
multiple organs and tissues using the approach for a single prospective cohort. There are few 
studies in the literature comparing PM2.5 associations on cancer mortality among different 
organs or tissues. We found stronger associations with PM2.5 in the upper digestive tract and 
accessory organs, and breast than among all-cancer or all-digestive organs. While most of 
our findings on specific cancers were not reported in the American Cancer Society study, our 
observations are consistent with the American Cancer Society study in a way that the excess 
risks of specific causes were larger than those of less specific causes (9). Our HR per 10 
μg/m 3 PM2.5 for female genital cancer and for breast cancer were about 40-50% higher than 
the reported relative risk (1.20 and 1.19, respectively) in an ecological study of all ages in 
Taiwan (27, 28). When compared with the American Cancer Society study, our HR per 10 
μg/m 3 PM2.5 for all-digestive organs and for male lung cancer was fairly similar to their 
respective HR of 1.20 and 1.43, adjusted for individual covariates and components of social 
factors (9). 



A hypothesis for an explanation at the molecular level of the carcinogenic effects of PM 
could be in terms of defects in DNA repair function and replication (29). Effects of oxidative 
stress due to air pollution have also been shown in biomarker studies (30). However, 
pathological explanations for specific cancer mortality are rare. For digestive systems the 
hypothesized mechanisms include inflammations of gut lining epithelial cells following 
ingestion, alterations in immune response and effects on gut microbiota (31). These 
hypotheses may be connected to aerosolized pollutants which are trapped by mucus and 
swallowed, eventually passing through the whole digestive tract and affecting the epithelial 
cells and the gut microbiota. A large-scale European case-control study of household wood 
burning on esophageal cancer (32), and an ecological Spanish study of industrial metallic 
aerosols on gallbladder and pancreas cancers have also indicated similar associations of air 
pollutants with cancer of the upper digestive tract and accessory organs (33). 
A human experimental study on metal species in thyroid cancer have hypothesized 
environmental contamination as a possible factor in explaining the thyroid pathology (34). 
Though the evidence is still insufficient, the literature has given some support to our findings 
on the PM-related cancer risks on multiple sites including digestive system, lung, breasts, 
genital organs, and lympho-hematopoietic tissues. 
Most studies of the long-term associations of PM estimated proxy exposure of individuals at 
region of residence, either using geospatial/dispersion modeling or satellite information (5, 
9, 35–38). However, estimation of chronic health associations of PM using intra-region 
spatial variation in the present study has resulted in similar hazard ratios to those studies 
relying on contrasts of multiple region-wide average exposures. The smaller estimates in the 
latter were likely due to the greater exposure measurement errors which led to 
underestimation of the pollution-related health burden (9). A California study showed that 
associations within cities are similar as between cities and the difference in exposure metrics 
had little impact on the risk estimates for PM2.5 (39). We found that there were no 
differences between estimates before and after controlling for intra-district correlations with 
random effect modeling. This result was supported by another US study on incidence of 
cardiovascular events, incorporating a random effect term for between-city and within-city 
effects (40). 
There were limitations in the present study. First, we did not address the associations of 
multi-pollutant exposure, indoor air pollution, chemical and physical-size components of 
PM2.5. The roles of PM2.5 cannot be disentangled from the other environmental pollutants. 
Second, we did not assess the contribution of genetic factors, metastasis, nor cancer- 
inhibitory inflammation mechanism for the association, and because of that we were not 
able to determine the effects of PM on susceptible groups and on cancer development (13). 
Third, the short period of the study, which does not allow assessment of health outcomes 
with long latency period, is another limitation. However the participants could have already 
been living in the same address before enrollment, since the 5-year moving rates in the older 
population were consistent and less than 15% in the past 10-15 years (41), only 9.3% of the 
subjects were found not residing in the same address during the around 10 years of follow- 
up and the estimates were robust to exclusion of movers from the analysis. Fourth, most of 
the subjects (93%) were retired or not working anymore. Yet, their employment history was 



not known and any previous occupational exposure was not accounted for. Fifth, the daily 
activities of the subjects were not assessed in details by questionnaires. However, in our 
sensitivity analysis using annual mean exposure at year of comparison in model should have 
taken account of this. Outdoor activities (for example, travelling to other parts of the city) or 
indoor activities (such as the use of air purifiers) which would affect the exposure level of 
PM2.5 were not adjusted for. Further studies to take these into account are needed. Sixth, 
stage of cancer at diagnosis was not available in our data, which may affect the choice of 
treatment method and hence survival from premature death (42). However, since trends of 
PM in different geographic areas were stable over the study period, the effect estimates may 
not be affected substantially. 
Last but not least, selection bias may be an issue due to voluntary nature in the subject 
recruitment. Volunteers who were more aware of the “new” provision of elderly health 
service by the government could tend to be more conscious in seeking health care service, 
which would potentially lead to underestimation of the risk of PM in this study. 
For older people who dwell in a city with a dense population and high-rise buildings in Asia, 
long-term exposures to particulate air pollutants are associated with mortality from all 
cancers combined with a linear concentration response relationship. Associations were also 
found between PM2.5 and various specific cancers, including cancer in lung, all digestive 
organs, breasts and genital organs. The magnitudes of risks are comparable with those of 
other similar studies, providing further evidence to strengthen causality and support health 
economic assessments of cancer-related deaths attributable to air pollution.

Figure 2. The pattern of association between all-cancer mortality risk and long-term exposure to 
PM2.5 (μg/m 3). 
Solid line (95%CI: dashed line) based on fully adjusted model in Table 1 with natural spline 
on 2 degrees of freedom. The marks above the x-axis shows the measurements with the 
crowdedness indicating the distribution of PM2.5 concentration.
