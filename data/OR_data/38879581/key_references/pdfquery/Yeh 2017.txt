Abstract: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is receiving intense regulatory 
attention in Taiwan. In previous studies, the effect of air pollution on bladder cancer has been 
explored. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of atmospheric PM2.5 and other local 
risk factors on bladder cancer mortality based on available 13-year mortality data. Geographically 
weighted regression (GWR) was applied to estimate and interpret the spatial variability of the 
relationships between bladder cancer mortality and ambient PM2.5 concentrations, and other variables 
were covariates used to adjust for the effect of PM2.5. After applying a GWR model, the concentration 
of ambient PM2.5 showed a positive correlation with bladder cancer mortality in males in northern 
Taiwan and females in most of the townships in Taiwan. This is the ﬁrst time PM2.5 has been identiﬁed 
as a risk factor for bladder cancer based on the statistical evidence provided by GWR analysis. 


Particulate matter (PM) is microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the atmosphere. 
Subtypes of atmospheric particulate matter include suspended particulate matter (SPM), thoracic and 
respirable particles [1], inhalable coarse particles, which are particles with a diameter between 2.5 and 
10 micrometers (µm), ﬁne particles with a diameter of 2.5 µm or less [2] (PM2.5), ultraﬁne particles 
(PM10), and soot. PM2.5 is found in secondary production through photochemical reactions from 
hydrocarbons and oxides of nitrogen in the air [2] or in the emission of motor vehicles [3]. PM2.5 also 
has been conﬁrmed to be associated with health risks including elevated morbidity [4–8] in human 
populations around the world. Numerous epidemiological studies have shown associations between 
PM2.5 exposure and respiratory-related mortality, and cardiovascular-related diseases [9,10]. Few 
studies have explored the effect of air pollution on bladder cancer speciﬁcally. A study in Spain pointed 
out that long-term exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and diesel engine emissions 
from industries near residential areas was associated with higher risk of bladder cancer [11]. In Taiwan, 
one matched case-control study found a dose-dependent effect of exposure to NO2, SO2, and PM10 
on bladder cancer mortality [12]. In Brazil, a correlation was observed between PM10 exposure and 
bladder cancer incidence [13]. In the United States, air pollution ozone days were positively associated 
with increased bladder cancer mortality [14]. Increased health risks of bladder cancer from exposure

to PM10 in air were found in most of these studies. However, no report has yet found an association 
between exposure to the smaller PM2.5 and bladder cancer mortality, although in the ﬁeld of occupation 
medicine, an association was found between bladder cancer incidence and PAH exposure [15,16], and 
the concentration of PAHs in air was found to be correlated to PM2.5. Thus, PM2.5 might play a role in 
the etiology of bladder cancer. 
Previous studies indicated that risk factors associated with bladder cancer include cigarette 
smoking, occupational exposure in the textile industry [17], arsenic in drinking water, environmental 
pollution, sex, and socioeconomic status [18,19]. The age-adjusted bladder cancer mortality in Taiwan 
ranged from 2.18 to 2.73 per 100,000 population during 2000–2012, and the age-adjusted bladder cancer 
incidence ranged from 5.93 to 8.06 per 100,000 population [20]. Both the mortality and incidence of 
bladder cancer were declining during this 13-year period. However, the geographically speciﬁc risks 
of bladder cancer mortality persisted in some areas such as where Blackfoot disease (BFD) is endemic, 
and exposure to arsenic in well waters as a speciﬁc risk factor is well documented [18,19]. Thus, this 
study was conducted to elucidate the effect of local risk factors on bladder cancer mortality based on 
the available 13-year mortality data. To show the spatial heterogeneity risk factors, geographically 
weighted regression (GWR) was employed in data analysis. 




The age-adjusted bladder cancer mortality rates at the township level were downloaded from 
the website of the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare of Taiwan [20]. 
The World Health Organization’s world standard population in 2000 was used as the reference 
population. There are 352 townships in 19 cities or counties, on the main island of Taiwan. In order 
to focus on the effect of PM2.5 and other risk factors rather than arsenic exposure, we excluded 
four BFD-endemic townships located in southwestern Taiwan. The remaining 348 townships were 
included for further analysis, on the assumption that the arsenic concentrations in drinking water 
are similar in these townships. The International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) 
codes 188 were used for the deﬁnitions of bladder cancer. The ring map toolbox of ArcGIS was applied 
to display the spatio-temporal distribution of bladder cancer mortality rate of 19 cities or counties 
(including 352 townships) from 2000 to 2012 simultaneously [21]. 

The smoking rates were accessed from “Adult Smoking Behavior Surveillance System” of 
Taiwan [22]. The average smoking rate (% smokers among total population) was computed for 
each city or county; the limitations of these data have been discussed elsewhere [23]. 

The daily levels of PM2.5 at 73 monitoring stations from 2006 to 2011 were acquired from the 
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) [23]. The annual average concentration of ambient 
PM2.5 (µg/m3) was computed for each station. Then the empirical Bayesian Kriging [24] in ArcGIS 
(ArcMap, version10.3; ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) was used to interpolate the annual concentrations 
throughout Taiwan, and the zonal statistics function was used to calculate the average concentration 
for each township. Finally, we averaged the annual PM2.5 concentrations for each township. 



The density of health care facilities of each township was used as the proxy indicator 
the 
for the spatial disparity of health care resources diversity. 
National-Health-Insurance-contracted hospitals or clinics during 2008–2012 in each township was 
retrieved as the numerator of the density of health care facilities, and the denominator was the 
area (km2) of each township. The National Health Insurance of Taiwan is a compulsory universal 
single-payer social health insurance system, which covers over 99% of the population in Taiwan [25]. 


The area deprivation index (ADI) of this present study was composed of the standardized 
proportion of elementary occupations (including simple farming, forestry, ﬁshing, and animal 
husbandry) and the standardized drop-out rate of students aged 15 to 17 from school. The ADI 
formula has been used in Taiwan as a proxy indicator for socioeconomic status [26]. Data were 
acquired from the population and housing census data of the year 2010 [27]. 

The percentage of aboriginal population at the township level from 2008 to 2011 was directly 
downloaded from the social-economic database of the Ministry of the Interior, Republic of China 
(Taiwan) [28]. The percentage of the elderly population (aged 65 or older) at the township level was 
computed from the household registration data of townships from 2000 to 2012. 




To understand the relationship between bladder cancer mortality and possible risk factors 
including smoking, PM2.5, density of health care facilities, area deprivation index, and percentages 
of aborigines, elderly, and textile workers among the population, GWR was carried out to estimate 
and interpret the spatial variability of their relationships [23,29,30]. GWR is a powerful method for 
exploring spatial heterogeneity, through extending traditional regression by allowing local variations 
in rates of change so that the coefﬁcients in the model are estimated at speciﬁc locations [31]. Unlike 
conventional ordinary least-squares regression analysis (OLS), GWR model is a type of local statistic 
in which the parameter estimations vary over space, and hence each area has different coefﬁcients. 
The assumption of spatial non-stationarity is made in GWR, which means the correlations between 
the independent variable and dependent variables are not the same for every area [30]. First of 
all, R software 3.2.1 (R Development Core Team, Vienna, Austria) [32] was used to run the OLS to 
determine the correlations between bladder cancer mortality and the risk factors considered. Then, free 
software GWR 4.0 (Ritsumeikan University, Kyoto, Japan) [33] was used to run the GWR analysis [34]. 
The coefﬁcients of each explanatory variable and the R-square in both OLS and GWR are summarized 
in the results. The residual maps and the spatial distribution of the signiﬁcant explanatory variables 
after a GWR analysis will be displayed in the results with ArcGIS (ArcMap, version 10.3; ESRI Inc., 
Redlands, CA, USA). A Local Moran’s I (Local Indicators of Spatial Association, LISA) cluster map of 
the residuals was created for identifying the clusters which cannot be explained by the current risk 
factors [23]. The LISA method shows four types of statistically signiﬁcant high/low clusters, in which 
a high value is surrounded primarily by high values called a high-high cluster, and so on. Finally, we 
ﬁnd the signiﬁcant predictors of bladder cancer mortality by using the results of difference of criterion 
after GWR. A negative value of difference of criterion suggests spatial variability in terms of model 
selection criteria. 


The age-adjusted bladder cancer mortality rate in males signiﬁcantly declined gradually from 
3.66 per 100,000 in 2000 to 3.01 per 100,000 in 2012 (p < 0.05) and the result for females also signiﬁcantly 
declined from 1.65 per 100,000 in 2000 to 1.49 per 100,000 in 2012 (Figure 1, p < 0.05). On average, the 
mortality in males was two times higher than the mortality in females. In Figure 2, the ring maps 


present the age-adjusted mortality rates of bladder cancer in 19 cities or counties across 13 years. 
The spatial distribution shows that in southwestern Taiwan, especially Chiayi county and Tainan city, 
there were persistently higher mortality rates than other cities or counties. The reason is that there 
were four BFD endemic townships in those two regions, as we mentioned in the method section. Thus, 
we excluded those four townships to avoid the confounding effect in the following analysis.

In Table 1, the OLS model was applied to demonstrate the relationship between bladder cancer 
age-adjusted mortality and the risk factors. For males, ambient PM2.5 concentration and elderly 
population showed signiﬁcant positive correlations with bladder cancer mortality (p < 0.05), and 
the ADI and percentage of the aborigines had signiﬁcant inverse correlation with bladder cancer 
mortality (p < 0.05). The overall adjusted R-square was 9.2%. For females, smoking rate, ambient PM2.5 
concentration, and health care facilities density displayed signiﬁcant positive correlations with bladder 
cancer mortality (p < 0.05), but the percentage of aboriginal population demonstrated signiﬁcant 
inverse correlation with bladder cancer mortality (p < 0.05). The overall adjusted R-square was 
13.2%. The variance inﬂation factor (VIF) values were all below 7.5, which indicates that there was no 
collinearity problem.

We used the quartile method to represent the distribution of coefﬁcients across the 348 townships 
in Table 2. The summary statistics of the coefﬁcients after applying GWR for every township are listed. 
For the males, the medians of three factors’ coefﬁcients including smoking rate, health care facilities 
density, and the population of elderly are all positively correlated with bladder cancer mortality. 
The overall adjusted R-square was 16.2%. For the females, the medians of smoking rate, PM2.5, health 
care facilities density, percentage of working in textile industry, and the percentage of the elderly 
population were all positively correlated with bladder cancer mortality. The overall adjusted R-square 
was 20%. 
The residual maps after GWR (adjusted for all the above variables) are shown in Figure 3. They 
indicate that the standard residual in many townships remained larger than 2. Thus, we used local 
Moran’s I to identify the local high-high clusters of residuals. For both males and females (Figure 4), 
the high-high clusters were all in southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung City and Tainan City.

The residual maps after GWR (adjusted for all the above variables) are shown in Figure 3. They 
indicate that the standard residual in many townships remained larger than 2. Thus, we used local 
Moran’s I to identify the local high-high clusters of residuals. For both males and females (Figure 4), 
the high-high clusters were all in southern Taiwan, including Kaohsiung City and Tainan City.

In order to show the effects of the signiﬁcant risk factors for the mortality rates of bladder cancer, 
we displayed the spatial distribution of four signiﬁcant predictors of bladder cancer mortality in males 
(Figure 5). In males, the smoking rate and PM2.5 both had higher positive correlations with bladder 
cancer mortality in northern Taiwan; although the area deprivation index showed negative correlation 
with bladder cancer mortality, especially in southern Taiwan. However, the population of elderly 
males showed positive correlation with bladder cancer mortality, especially in central and southern 
Taiwan. In females (Figure 6), smoking rate, PM2.5, health care facilities density, and the population of 
elderly all showed positive correlations with bladder cancer mortality; area deprivation index showed 
a positive effect only in northern Taiwan, while the percentage of female aborigines showed a negative 
effect throughout all of Taiwan.

mortality. However, the spatial effects of smoking rate were different. In males, the effect in northern 
Taiwan was higher, but in females, the effect in southern Taiwan was higher. In the results of one 
meta-analysis [36], cigarette smoking had a higher probability of inducing a more malignant type of 
urothelial carcinoma and an increased risk of dying due to bladder cancer.

This paper presents a 13-year spatial-temporal distribution of age-adjusted bladder cancer 
mortality, and identiﬁes possible cluster areas for future epidemiologic investigation. In this study, we 
ﬁrst excluded the arsenic exposure in four BFD townships to disentangle the effects between PM2.5 
and arsenic exposure on bladder cancer mortality. Spatial variation of the risk factors indeed existed 
in this study. Thus, the overall R-square performance was elevated 7% from OLS to GWR. Although 
the temporal trend of bladder cancer mortality was declining, we still found some local clustering 
townships in southern Taiwan which could not be explained by the current explanatory variables. 

In accordance with previous studies, this study has found that elderly male subjects were more 
prone to develop bladder cancer than females. Aside from age and sex, there are several other risk 
factors for bladder cancer, including smoking, industrial exposure, certain medicines or herbal dietary 
supplements, arsenic in drinking water, lack of ﬂuids intake, etc. [35]. Among the risk factors analyzed 
in this study, the smoking rates of both sexes were positively correlated with bladder cancer mortality. 

















 
 



 


However, the spatial effects of smoking rate were different. In males, the effect in northern Taiwan was 
higher, but in females, the effect in southern Taiwan was higher. In the results of one meta-analysis [36], 
cigarette smoking had a higher probability of inducing a more malignant type of urothelial carcinoma 
and an increased risk of dying due to bladder cancer. 
PM2.5 had signiﬁcant positive correlation with bladder cancer mortality in the OLS analysis. From 
the GWR analysis, PM2.5 had higher positive correlation with bladder cancer mortality in males in 
northern Taiwan and females in central Taiwan. In females, bladder cancer mortality in most of the 
townships showed a positive correlation with PM2.5. In one of the previous studies, bladder cancer 
mortality in America was found to be higher in areas with high population density, suggesting that a 
possible cause might be air pollution [37]. Results of one case-control study in Taiwan also showed 
that NO2, SO2, and PM10 all had signiﬁcant effects on bladder cancer mortality [12]. 
The GWR result indicates that health care facility density is positively correlated with bladder 
cancer mortality in both sexes. This may be attributed to highly urbanized areas with high density of 
healthcare institutions [38] and air pollution [37]. 
The ADI of the present study can represent the urbanization level of townships in Taiwan, 
because it included the standardized proportion of elementary occupations and the standardized 
school drop-out rate of students aged 15 to 17. The higher ADI is, the less the urbanization of the 
township, and the fewer pollutants there are from industries and trafﬁc. This might explain why ADI is 
negatively correlated with bladder cancer mortality in males. Females from less urbanized townships 
having higher bladder cancer mortality could be attributable to indoor PM2.5 exposure. Other than 
gas and electricity, wood and charcoal were also commonly used decades ago as cooking fuels in 
rural townships in Taiwan, and charcoal is still popular for barbecues in restaurants and at home on 
certain holidays. These fuels can produce vast amounts of indoor PM2.5 [39]. However, the relationship 
between ADI and bladder cancer mortality is worth clarifying using a different study design. 

This study demonstrated correlations between some variables and bladder cancer mortality. Like 
most other studies, we assumed the values at monitoring stations were highly correlated with values 
at breathing zones [40,41], and all subjects are assumed to have had the same exposures in the same 
area, estimated by mean concentrations. There are some limitations in this study. First, because 
of the long latency of bladder cancer and the fact that the bladder cancer mortality data precede 
the period for which monitored PM2.5 data became available, we have to assume that the relative 
magnitude of exposure concentrations among these townships remained constant over past decades. 
This assumption seems reasonable because most of the increase in PM2.5 is due to the rapid increase in 
motor vehicles, and the relative rate of increase of motor vehicle ownership among these townships 
should remain roughly similar over the years. The second limitation is a lack of personal medication 
information. Traditional Chinese medicines and dietary supplements containing aristolochic acid have 
been linked with an increased risk of urothelial cancers, including bladder cancer [42,43], and these 
medicines were not banned in Taiwan until 2013. 
Type 2 diabetes is one of the leading causes of death in Taiwan. Oral antidiabetic agents are often 
prescribed to patients suffering type 2 diabetes to control blood glucose concentration. Results of 
population-based cohort studies show that pioglitazone, an antidiabetic medication, is associated with 
an increased risk of bladder cancer [44,45]. In addition, the spatial unit of smoking rates was the city 
or county level rather than township. Therefore, the heterogeneities within a city or county would be 
underestimated due to this limitation of the data. However, we tried to evaluate the result by using 
lung cancer mortality which is based on township to replace smoking rates. Both results were similar 
(Tables A1 and A2). For a future study, we plan to use lung cancer data to adjust the smoking rate to 
the township level. Other lifestyle factors such as intake of fruits and vegetables, taking vitamins and 
antioxidant supplements, and physical activity, which are factors protecting against bladder cancer, 
have been reviewed recently [46]. Furthermore, there is a lack of relevant health data, such as disease 


history and obesity. After controlling for age, sex, and smoking status, subjects with kidney disease 
had higher bladder cancer mortality [47]. Results of a meta-analysis by Sun et al. [48] showed that 
individuals with BMI ≥ 30 had higher risk of bladder cancer death. 

This study displays the temporal and spatial distribution of bladder cancer mortality in Taiwan. 
We compared the result of traditional linear model OLS and GWR. The coefﬁcient of determination 
(adjusted R-square) was higher in the GWR model. Apparently, GWR can explain the correlation 
between disease mortality and environment risk factors by considering the spatial heterogeneity. 
After applying a GWR model, the concentration of ambient PM2.5 showed positive correlation with 
bladder cancer mortality in males in northern Taiwan, and females in most of the townships in Taiwan. 
Having examined the results, there are still some abnormal clusters in southern Taiwan. This will need 
further research to clarify the relationship between local risk factors and bladder cancer mortality.
