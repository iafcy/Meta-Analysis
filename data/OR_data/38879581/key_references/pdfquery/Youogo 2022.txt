Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer 
and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide.1 
In 2021, there were an estimated 24,000 new cases of prostate 
cancer and 4,500 deaths in Canada.2 
Currently, age, ethnicity, and family history of prostate can- 
cer are the only established risk factors for prostate cancer, but 
these are not modifiable.3 The role of several modifiable risk fac- 
tors has been evaluated but the findings have been inconsistent.

These factors include lifestyle (diet, physical activity, anthro- 
pometry) and occupational exposures (e.g., cadmium, pesti- 
cides).4,5 Studies of prostate cancer in migrants and as well as 
observed geographical variations in prostate cancer incidence 
rates suggest that environmental exposures are etiologically 
relevant.6 
Ambient air pollution is characterized by the contamination 
of the environment by chemical, physical, or biological agents. 
The most common sources are emissions from motor vehicles, 
combustion processes of solid fuels, and industry.7 Fine particles 
with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are among the most commonly studied 
air pollutants. NO2 is a marker for vehicle emissions and contain 
carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 
and benzo(a)pyrene.8 Air pollution is a recognized risk factor 
for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and in 2013, the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified 
particulate matter air pollution as a human carcinogen.9–11 While 
there is sufficient evidence of an association between air pollu- 
tion and lung cancer, the evidence for other cancer sites is limited. 
The possibility that air pollution increases the risk of developing 
nonrespiratory cancers is strengthened with findings of positive 

Prostate cancer remains an important public health problem 
because it is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in 
men. In this study, we examined the potential role of outdoor 
air pollution in its etiology. This study found that exposure to 
NO2 and PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of prostate 
cancer. The findings presented in this article fill an important 
research gap as few studies have previously evaluated associ- 
ations between air pollution and prostate cancer. This study 
adds to the growing epidemiological literature that exposure to 
ambient air pollution may increase the risk of nonrespiratory 
cancers. 





Background: Ambient air pollution is a human carcinogen and a possible risk factor for prostate cancer. 
Methods: We investigated associations between ambient concentrations particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
and incident prostate cancer in a Canadian case-control study. Between 1994 and 1997, cases were identified from provincial 
cancer registries, and a population-based series of controls was recruited. Among men 50 years of age or older, risk factor and res- 
idential history data (1975 to 1994) were collected from 1,420 prostate cancer cases and 1,424 controls. Three methods were used 
to estimate the residential mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 during this period: (1) satellite-derived observations; (2) satellite-derived 
observations scaled with historical fixed-site measurements; and (3) a national land-use regression (LUR) model. Odds ratios (ORs) 
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in relation to interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM2.5 and NO2 were estimated using logis- 
tic regression, adjusting for personal and contextual factors. 
Results: We found positive associations between exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 over the previous 20 years and prostate cancer. An 
IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.56 µg/m3 for satellite and 4.48 µg/m3 for scaled satellite observations) yielded ORs of 1.28 (95% CI = 1.07, 
1.52) and 1.20 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.40), respectively. For NO2, IQR increases (1.45 ppb for satellite, 15.18 ppb for scaled satellite-de- 
rived information, and 15.39 ppb for the national LUR) were associated with ORs of 1.09 (95% CI = 0.95, 1.24), 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02, 
1.43), and 1.19 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.38), respectively. 
Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that ambient air pollution increases the risk of prostate cancer. 



associations for brain, colorectal, and breast cancer.12–14 For 
prostate cancer, few studies have assessed the impact of air pol- 
lution on incidence and the findings have been mixed.15–19 There 
are several plausible mechanisms whereby exposure to air pol- 
lution increases the risk of prostate cancer. Air pollution-related 
chemicals can potentially act directly on the prostate through cell 
membrane disruption, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
and tumor necrosis factor α, and apoptosis by the mitochon- 
dria; in addition, PAHs, benzene, and cadmium can act indirectly 
through endocrine-disrupting properties.20,21 
Given the relatively few studies on air pollution and prostate 
cancer and the inconsistency in their findings, we sought to eval- 
uate associations between past long-term exposure to ambient 
NO2 and PM2.5 using a previously conducted Canadian popula- 
tion-based case-control study. 


Our study population was drawn from the Canadian National 
Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System (NECSS). The NECSS 
is a large multisite cancer population-based case-control study 
conducted between 1994 and 1997. Data were collected from 
participants who resided in eight of the 10 Canadian provinces 
(all provinces but Quebec and New Brunswick). The overall aim 
of the NECSS was to identify environmental causes of cancer. 
Detailed methods for the NECSS are published elsewhere.22 
Briefly, in this population-based case-control study, incident 
cancer cases were identified by provincial cancer registries. The 
NECSS included cancer cases for 19 different types of cancer 
sites. All cancers were histologically confirmed diagnoses of 
cancer and classified using the International Classification of 
Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) rubrics.23 Controls were selected 
during the same time period as the cases from a random sam- 
ple of individuals from each of the participating provinces, the 
age and sex distribution of controls in the NECSS was frequen- 
cy-matched to the age-sex distribution across all 19 types of 
cancers. For age, frequency matching was done by 5-year age 
groupings. The control selection strategy varied by province 
depending on data availability and accessibility: Provincial 
health insurance plans (95% of individuals are covered by 
this type of service; however, military personnel and their fam- 
ilies and Aboriginals were excluded because they are covered 
by other plans) were used in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia; In Ontario, 
controls were selected using data from the Ministry of Finance 
Property Assessment, whereas in Alberta and Newfoundland, 
random digit dialing was used. 
The NECSS sought the participation of 2,781 histologically 
confirmed incident prostate cancer cases (ICD-9: 185) that were 
initially identified. Of these, 414 men were excluded from the 
study for any of the following reasons: patient had died, incor- 
rect mailing address, or physician consent was not granted. 
Self-administered surveys were mailed to the remaining 2,367 
men, and of these, 1,799 were completed and returned, repre- 
senting a 76% participation rate. Questionnaires were mailed to 
4,235 men identified as potential controls. For 287 of these men 
(6.8%), questionnaires were returned indicating an incorrect 
address. Among controls, 2,547 men completed and returned 
the questionnaire representing a 64.5% participation rate. 
We restricted the analysis to cases and controls 50 years of age 
and older as diagnoses of prostate cancer at younger ages are rare 
and tend to reflect genetic susceptibility rather than an environmen- 
tal cause.24 This was a relatively small number of cases (n = 12). 

Participants were asked to provide demographic information 
including age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), education, 
and residential history. The questionnaire also asked partici- 
pants to provide anthropometric measures (height and weight), 
as well as information on their smoking history, exposure to 
environmental tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption, physical 
activity, and dietary patterns. Self-reported measures of expo- 
sure to pesticides and cadmium were also collected. A complete 
residential history (since the age of 18) was sought, and par- 
ticipants were asked to provide their address, including their 
six-character postal code. 

Based on residential histories, an average air pollution expo- 
sure concentration was assigned to each participant for each 
year between 1975 and 1994. We restricted analyses to subjects 
with 20 years of exposure in the main analyses. Exposures were 
derived by a member of the team (P.H.) and details about the 
methodology that was used have previously been published.25 In 
brief, this exposure characterization involved first geocoding the 
six-character postal codes from the residential histories using the 
1996 DMTI Spatial, Inc (Markham, Ontario, Canada). postal 
code database. In Canadian urban areas, a six-character postal 
code represents a specific block (one side of a street between two 
intersecting streets), a single building or sometimes a large vol- 
ume mail receiver, while in rural areas, a 6-character postal code 
represents larger areas, sometimes an entire town or county.26,27 
After geocoding the postal address’s location to assign the NO2 
and PM2.5 concentrations of the subjects for all addresses they 
lived at during the study period, we assigned pollution concen- 
trations using three methods. We opted to model three different 
exposure metrics as these measures have distinct strengths and 
limitations. For example, our satellite measurements were able 
to cover large geographical areas including those not covered by 
ground-based fixed-site monitors. The satellite measures could 
also be back-extrapolate to provide historical measures of air 
pollution concentrations. However, the satellite-derived expo- 
sure metric was limited in that the spatial resolution was modest 
(10 × 10 km). the land-use regression (LUR) model, on the other 
hand, provided a highly spatially resolved surface that could 
better capture smaller within-city variations in exposure but 
lacked the temporal component. Our decision to model these 
three metrics allowed us to better understand how the tempo- 
ral and spatial components of these exposures impacted disease 
risks. The metrics are described in more detail below. 
Satellite measures of PM2.5 and NO2 
NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from satel- 
lite measurements (using 2005–2007 retrievals for NO2 and 
2001–2006 retrievals for PM2.5) at 10 × 10 km resolution, 
scaled with a chemical transport model to estimate ground-level 
concentrations.28,29 
Scaled measures of PM2.5 and NO2 
To account for long-term spatiotemporal trends in air pollution 
between 1975 and 1994, we estimated the annual air pollutant 
concentrations during this period using satellite data that were 
calibrated using information from the National Air Pollution 
Surveillance (NAPS) network.30 The calibration was carried out 
as follows: 
NAPS monitoring data were first organized into monthly 
averages for both NO2 and PM2.5. Continuous monitoring data 
were included if at least 50% of the daily hourly observations 
were available and at least 50% of days were available in a 
month. Annual averages were calculated when complete data 
were available for at least 6 months with at least one month per 
season. Given the lack of spatial and temporal measurements 
of PM2.5 before 1984, collocated measurements of PM2.5 and 



total suspended particles (TSPs) between 1984 and 2000 were 
used to create predictive models of historical PM2.5 concentra- 
tions: random effects linear regression models (GLIMMIX pro- 
cedure in SAS 9.3, Cary, North Carolina) were developed to 
account for the clustering of annual measurements over time at 
each NAPS monitoring station. The R2 and root mean square 
error (RMSE) were 0.67 and 2.31, respectively; the resulting 
model was applied to all valid TSP monitoring stations. Next, 
at each ground-based fixed monitoring site, a ratio of annual 
measured concentration of NO2 and PM2.5 to the satellite esti- 
mated concentration was computed, and then we conducted 
smoothed inverse distance weighting interpolation of the ratios. 
The resulting interpolated areas were multiplied by the original 
satellite area, generating histories of the adjusted annual NO2 
and PM2.5 estimates for each year from 1975 to 1994. 
Land-use regression surface for NO2 
For the third method (LUR surface for NO2), data were pro- 
vided by the Canadian Consortium on Urban Environmental 
Health (CANUE: www.canue.ca). Details of the method used 
to generate these data are provided elsewhere.31 Briefly, the 
national NO2 LUR model was developed using 2006 NAPS 
fixed-site monitoring data. To capture background and regional 
NO2 variation, NO2 satellite estimates from 2005 to 2011, area 
of industrial land use within 2 km, road length within 10 km 
and summer rainfall were used as predictors. To capture local- 
scale variations, distance-decay gradients were developed from 
a literature review and applied to the regression model estimates 
for postal codes near highways (NO2 increases around 65% 
near highways and decreases to background levels at 300 m) 
and major roads (NO2 increases around 20% near major roads 
and decreases to background level at 100 m). The final LUR 
model explained 73% of the variation in NAPS measurements 
with a RMSE of 2.9 ppb and matches well with city-specific 
NO2 land-use regression models, which typically have R2 values 
between 0.54 and 0.81.32 The model was developed for all study 
postal codes to estimate concentrations of NO2, and we then 
calculated an average concentration for the 1975–1994 expo- 
sure period; NO2 concentrations for year 1984 were assigned to 
years prior to 1984. 

We assessed proximity to roadways as an alternative surrogate 
measure of vehicle emissions. Due to the lack of historical data 
on the national road network, we used the 1996 road network 
data (DMTI Spatial, Inc.); from this, we estimated estimate the 
number of years lived within 50,100 and 300 m of roads (high- 
way and/or major road). This variable was transformed into a 
two-category variable: subjects who never lived near these roads 
and the others who lived near either or both. 

Individual characteristics collected from the survey were used to 
derive a series of adjustment factors for inclusion in our mod- 
els, including: ethnicity (Caucasian, Black, Asian, and other), 
alcohol consumption (servings/week), smoking (pack-years), 
physical activity (number of hours per month of moderate and 
strenuous activity), total caloric intake (derived from a food-fre- 
quency questionnaire about recent intakes), body mass index 
(BMI) (<20, 20 to <25, 25 to <30, and ≥30 kg/m2), self-reported 
exposure to pesticides and cadmium at home or at work (never/ 
ever), and level of education and residential surrounding green- 
ness.33–35 The latter was based on the Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a commonly used measure 
of vegetation. Our measure of NDVI covered a 500 m buffer 
around the residence for 20 years (between 1975 and 1994). 
The neighborhood socioeconomic status index (in quintiles) 
was also considered as a potential confounder as it has been 
shown that less affluent neighborhoods have, on average, higher 
concentrations of air pollution36,37; moreover, men who live in 
a socially advantaged neighborhoods have been found to be 
greater risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer.38 

We used (unconditional) logistic regression to estimate odds 
ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of asso- 
ciations between exposure to air pollution and prostate cancer. 
We modeled these association in relation to an interquartile 
range (IQR) increase in NO2 (1.45 ppb, 15.18 ppb, and 15.39 
ppb for satellite, scaled, and LUR, respectively) and PM2.5 (3.56 
µg/m3 and 4.48 µg/m3 for satellite and scaled satellite, respec- 
tively). This allowed us to compare the strength of the associa- 
tion across the different pollutants and metrics. For all analyses, 
three different models were fit: 


• Model 2: same variables as model 1 and additional per- 
sonal potential confounders: ethnicity, BMI, alcohol con- 
sumption, total caloric intake, education, moderate and 
strenuous physical activity, smoking, exposures to pesticide 
and cadmium. 
• Model 3: same variables as model 2 with the addition 
of two contextual variables: a long-term neighborhood 
socioeconomic status index and residential surrounding 
greenness. 
Age, smoking, education, total calorie intake, alcohol con- 
sumption, moderate and strenuous physical activity, and green- 
ness were modeled as continuous variables after confirming 
linearity of the logits. We assessed the shape of the exposure-re- 
sponse function between exposure to pollutants and pros- 
tate cancer by using a cubic smoothing splines function with 
4 degrees of freedom (df).39 
Due to the presence of missing data for some covariates 
(ranging from 0.13% to 21.1%) and assuming that the mech- 
anism behind them was either Missing Completely at Random 
(MCAR) or Missing at Random (MAR), we conducted multiple 
imputations using chained equations (MICE).40 The main results 
presented herein are based on analyses that used imputation. 

In addition to the main analyses, we performed sensitivity anal- 
yses by restricting to participants with complete data to evaluate 
the robustness of the results when compared to findings based 
on imputed data. Because of postal codes in rural areas are not 
highly spatially resolved, we also performed separate analyses 
restricted to subjects living in urban areas (which corresponds 
to an area with a population of at least 1,000).41 

The original NECSS data set included 4,346 cases and controls; 
1,502 subjects were excluded for one of the following reasons: 
missing address, age <50 years, and < 20 years of residential his- 
tory between 1975 and 1994. As a result, a total of 2,844 sub- 
jects (1,420 cases and 1,424 controls) were included in our study 
(flow chart presented in Supplementary Material: Figure S1; 
http://links.lww.com/EE/A194). 
Table 1 shows the risk factor distributions for several char- 
acteristics among cases and controls. The average age at diag- 
nosis in our case series was 66.7 years (±5.6 years), while the 
mean age in the control series was 65.5 years (±6.4 years). Study 
subjects were largely Caucasian, there was a slight difference

ferences in the means were tested using the Student t test). The 
average 20-year concentration of pollutants was slightly higher 
for cases compared to controls: 1.4 ppb (±1.2) versus 1.4 ppb 
(±1.3); 16.3 ppb (±9.0) versus 15.5 ppb (±8.9); and 19.8 ppb 
(±11.6) versus 18.8 ppb (±11.8) for NO2 from satellite, scaled 
NO2, and NO2 from national LUR, respectively. For PM2.5 from 
satellite and scaled PM2.5, it was 7.7 µg/m3 (±2.4) versus 7.8 µg/m3 
(±2.5) and 12.0 µg/m3 (±3.0) versus 11.9 µg/m3 (±3.0) in cases 
and controls, respectively. 

The results from the three regression models for each expo- 
sure are shown in Table 2. For NO2, the model adjusted only 
for age and province (model 1) showed a modest association 
with prostate cancer risk regardless of the measure consid- 
ered. In contrast, after adjustment for several personal factors 
(model 2), the scaled estimates and the national LUR estimates 
were indicative of elevated risks, with ORs of 1.20 (95% 
CI = 1.03, 1.41) for a 15.18 ppb increase in NO2 and 1.16 
(95% CI = 1.01, 1.33) for a 15.39 ppb, respectively. Satellite 
surface-based risk estimates were weaker. Finally, for the fully 
adjusted model (model 3), there was a positive association for 
scaled estimates (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.43) and for 
national LUR estimates (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.38). 
Again, the strength of association with satellite surface esti- 
mates was weaker. 
We observed positive associations between long-term PM2.5 
exposure and prostate cancer incidence in all analyses except for 
scaled estimates in model 1. Using estimates of exposure from 
satellite, we found increased odds ratios of prostate cancer per 
3.56 μg/m3, i.e., 1.23 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.45), 1.30 (95% CI = 
1.10, 1.54), and 1.28 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.53) for models 1, 2, and 
3, respectively. Using scaled PM2.5, for every 4.48 μg/m3 increase

of PM2.5 concentration, the ORs were 1.12 (95% CI = 0.98, 
1.29), 1.22 (95% CI = 1.06, 1.40), and 1.20 (95% CI = 1.03, 
1.40) for models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
The final model for NO2 and PM2.5 led to changes in the ORs, 
mainly related to the influence from the contextual variables of 
neighborhood socioeconomic status index and residential sur- 
rounding greenness.

functions for other exposures were consistent with linearity and 
ORs increased proportionally to the concentration of the pollut- 
ant, with wider confidence intervals at the extremes due to the 
small number of subjects. 
Regarding the proximity to roads, while no clear increase in 
odds was apparent with prostate cancer risk, the odds of pros- 
tate cancer tended to be somewhat higher among those who 
had ever lived near roads relative to those who had not (results 
for the analyses on imputed and complete data are presented 
in Supplementary Material: Table S1a; http://links.lww.com/EE/ 
A194 and Table S1b; http://links.lww.com/EE/A194). 

Compared to the results on imputed data, after analysis on com- 
plete data, there were no material differences in the ORs between 
models 1 and 2. The adjusted odds ratios were, however, slightly 
lower for model 3 (see results in Supplementary Material: Table 
S2; http://links.lww.com/EE/A194). For an increase of an IQR, 
a positive association was observed for satellite observations of 
PM2.5 in all three models as well as for scaled PM2.5 estimates in 
model 2 (weaker in model 3). For NO2, a positive association 
was also observed for scaled estimates in model 2 and national 
LUR estimates in model 3 (weaker in model 2). For the anal- 
ysis restricted to those who lived in urban area, the results on 
the imputed data showed that for an IQR increase, ORs tended 
to be higher than when rural subjects were included (results 
in Supplementary Material: Table S3; http://links.lww.com/ 
EE/A194). For example, the fully adjusted ORs for NO2 were 
1.10 (95% CI = 0.96, 1.26), 1.27 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.54), and 
1.24 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.45) for satellite surface-based estimates, 
scaled estimates, and national LUR estimates, respectively. For 
PM2.5, the fully adjusted ORs were 1.31 (CI = 1.07, 1.60) and 
1.21 (CI = 1.02, 1.44) for satellite surface-based estimates and 
scaled estimates, respectively. 
Discussion 
Overall, we found that ambient NO2 and PM 2.5 over a 20-year 
period were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. 
There have been few previous studies of this topic, and for two 
of these studies, prostate cancer was not the cancer of a pri- 
ori interest.18,19 Previous studies typically considered only one 
pollutant and used different approaches to estimate long-term 
exposures. In our study, three approaches were used: satellite 
observations, which have the advantage of covering large geo- 
graphical areas but whose nonoptimal spatial resolution limits 
the use, scaled satellite measurements (corresponding to the cal- 
ibration of satellite observations with fixed sites of monitoring 
stations spread over the Canadian territory), which allowed for 
the temporal adjustment of satellite observations, and finally 
the national LUR model, which has a better spatial resolution 
and considers the local-scale variation of pollution, representing 
here the best approach to the estimation of the spatial variation 
of NO2. 
Our positive findings are consistent with two other case-con- 
trol studies of incident prostate cancer conducted in Montreal. 
The study by Parent et al16 focused on exposure to NO2 (in 2006 
and 1996, i.e., 10 years before) measured using the LUR model. 
The other study by Weichenthal et al15 studied concentrations 
of ambient ultrafine particles (at the time of recruitment and 10 
years before recruitment) measured using a LUR model. While we 
also found positive associations, the comparison of our findings 
to their is not straightforward due to differences in exposure peri- 
ods, and methods to characterize exposure. Namely, we examined 
exposure over a period extending from 1975 to 1994, whereas 
these two studies examined exposure at recruitment and 10 years 
earlier. An ecological study carried out in the United States in 
Erie County (Pennsylvania) found an association between expo- 
sure to airborne particles (measured from monitors at different 
monitoring stations over a period of 2 years) and prostate can- 
cer.17 Nevertheless, not all previous studies have reported posi- 
tive associations. For example, a Danish cohort study of 57,053 
subjects (men and women) recruited between 1993 and 1997 
and followed up until 2006 that investigated the relationship 
between NO2 and 20 different types of cancers found an associ- 
ation between NO2 exposure and cervical and brain cancer but 
not with prostate cancer.18 To our knowledge, our study is the 
only one to report associations between proximity to roads and 
prostate cancer incidence. The lack of evidence for an association 



using this metric, contrasting with the others, may reflect the fact 
that distances to road metrics are less capable of capturing vari- 
ations in exposure, such as due to traffic volume, than the other 
methods we used. Some studies have shown that agreement is 
not always good between air pollution measures from land-use 
regression surfaces and distance to roadway measures,41 and that 
LUR models are better predictors of traffic-related pollution.42 
Our study has some limitations. Selection bias cannot be ruled 
out due to modest participation rates (76% for cases and 64.5% 
for controls) and exclusion of some subjects because they did 
not meet the inclusion criteria. However, it was observed that 
after adjusting for factors typically related to nonresponse (e.g., 
income, education), there were no appreciable changes in the 
risk estimates. This suggests the potential for participation bias 
is small.43 In addition, in our view, participation bias is likely 
minimal given that the risk estimates obtained from the NECSS 
data across a series of etiological risk factors for different can- 
cer sites are similar to other published risk estimates. These 
risk factors have included diesel, obesity, and smoking, radon, 
and numerous others.44–46 Second, our analysis was limited due 
to missing covariates data. To mitigate this potential bias, we 
used multiple imputation, which represents a robust and valid 
approach for managing missing data and for obtaining unbiased 
estimators.40 Our sensitivity analyses suggest that there were no 
major differences in our measures of association between the 
imputed and nonimputed approaches. Third, the participants 
were not uniformly distributed geographically. However, the 
design of the NECSS study was such that each provincial can- 
cer registry was responsible for sampling and recruiting study 
participants and a province variable was included in the models 
to capture any differences in sampling strategies. Fourth, resid- 
ual confounding is possible in light of imperfectly measured or 
unknown confounders. Fifth, autopsy studies have shown that 
in men over 50 years of age, the prevalence of latent histological 
prostate cancer can be as high as 30%.47,48 Consequently, our 
controls likely included small proportion of undiagnosed pros- 
tate cancers, and this may have attenuated our risk estimates. 
In our study, we lack information about the aggressiveness of 
the disease or information about screening. Aggressive prostate 
cancer corresponds to a high-risk cancer, meaning it is likely 
to spread quickly outside the prostate. Although prostate can- 
cer is quite common, almost 15% of all cancers at the time of 
diagnosis are aggressive.49 Given that a percentage of prostate 
cancer cases are latent, the positive associations observed in our 
study may reflect increased detection rates due to a higher prev- 
alence of prostate cancer screening that occurs in some subpop- 
ulations. Several variables potentially correlated with screening 
(age, level of education, neighborhood SES index and ethnicity) 
were included in the models as adjustment variables, mitigating 
this potential bias to some extent. In our model, adjusting on the 
neighborhood socioeconomic status index (a composite variable 
including other variables such as household income, education, 
employment, living in rental housing or having moved in the last 
5 years), overadjustment remains a possibility. We nevertheless 
considered it in the adjustments since its link with prostate can- 
cer may exist through other known or unknown unmeasured 
factors. The latency period was chosen in accordance with the 
natural history of prostate cancer, but this choice may not be 
ideal. Different approaches were used to estimate air pollutants 
concentrations and they have some limitations, including the 
use of six-character postal codes to geolocate the residential 
addresses. These postal codes are accurate in urban areas but 
less so in rural areas as they can cover much larger areas (the 
sensitivity analysis characterized by the exclusion of subjects 
from rural areas effectively showed higher ORs); with the satel- 
lite method, it is assumed that the spatial patterns remained the 
same from 1975 to 2005 for NO2 and from 1975 to 2001 for 
PM2.5 and the resolution was limited to 10 km2; by integrating 
historical data, the calibration of these satellite data has partially 
addressed this concern; furthermore, concerning scaled PM2.5, 
the poor spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring prior to 
1984 led to the use of historical data based on TSP monitoring 
data and Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) indicator variables. 
These limitations potentially led to nondifferential misclassifi- 
cation in that the assessments were made independently of the 
case-control status of the subjects. Finally, although we were 
able to estimate exposure from residential histories, no informa- 
tion was available for other important microenvironments such 
as workplaces or transportation. 
The study benefits from several strengths. First, we exam- 
ined a large sample of prostate cancer cases (1,420 cases and 
1,424 controls). In addition, the study was based on the pop- 
ulation-based enrollment of incident cases and the use of stan- 
dardized questionnaires to collect information for a wide array 
of risk factors. We also had detailed information on residential 
history, which allowed us to construct detailed exposure metrics 
for an etiologically relevant time period and to assign NDVI 
levels, which have been inversely associated with ambient PM2.5 
and also to prostate cancer.50,51 We were also able to evaluate 
associations for two pollutants using exposure derived from 
both land-use regression and satellite imaging. The former pro- 
vides a more spatially resolved measure of air pollution,52 but 
findings based on the different approaches allow the impacts of 
temporality and spatial resolution to be evaluated. For exam- 
ple, a comparison of findings across the three metrics of NO2 
suggests that, for risk characterization, it is important to cap- 
ture intra-urban variations in concentrations. Several sensitivity 
analyses confirmed the robustness of our main findings. 

We found a positive association between air pollution and pros- 
tate cancer risk, providing further evidence in support of IARC’s 
classification of outdoor air pollution as a human carcinogen.10 
We recognize that few studies to date evaluated the role of air 
pollution in the development of prostate cancer, and that more 
work is needed in this area. In light of the study limitations, 
and of the significant clinical and economic burden of prostate 
cancer on the population, future research should account for the 
role of screening in the early detection of prostate cancer, and 
by extension, characterize variations in risk by prostate cancer 
aggressiveness.
