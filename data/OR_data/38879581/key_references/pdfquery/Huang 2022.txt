Introduction: Green space and air pollution have been recognized as vital health determinants. There is a paucity 
of studies examining the interplay between green space, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and the incidence of 
specific cancers. 
Objective: We aimed to explore the contributions of green space and ambient PM2.5 to the risk of specific cancers 
in terms of the most common cancers based on incidence or mortality rate in Taiwan and to ascertain the 
interaction between green space and PM2.5 and their role in cancer risk. 
Materials and methods: This retrospective longitudinal cohort study included 407,415 participants. Data were 
obtained from the 2000–2015 Mei Jau Health Examination Database linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry and 
Causes of Death datasets. All participants were aged ≥20 years and had no history of cancer. The environmental 
exposure were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2-year average PM2.5 at baseline. 
Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We adjusted 
for covariates including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, health behaviors, biochemical data, and 
environmental factors. 
Results: During a median follow-up of 10.37 years, 11,576 cancer cases were reported. PM2.5 exposure increased 
the risk of all cancers (HR: 1.11, [95% CI: 1.06–1.15]), stomach cancer (HR: 1.27, [1.02–1.58]), endocrine gland 
cancer (HR: 2.13, [1.39–3.26]), breast cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.03–1.22]), and lung cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.01–1.24]). 
An increase in NDVI reduced the risk of prostate cancer (HR: 0.93, [0.88–0.99]) and lung cancer (HR: 0.95, 
[0.91–0.99]). NDVI influenced the incidence of prostate and all cancers by reducing PM2.5 concentrations. 
Conclusion: Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with an increased risk of some types of cancers. In contrast, 
an increase in environmental green space exposure is associated with lowering of the risk of prostate and lung 
cancer. 

The urban environment is gradually being recognized as a crucial 
health determinant. Air quality and green space are vital constituents of 
the living environment. Considering the involuntary and ubiquitous 
nature of exposure, air pollution contributes to the risk of developing 
multiple illnesses. The association of long-term exposure to air pollution 
with increased risks of all-cause mortality (Beelen et al., 2014), car- 
diovascular disease (Cicoira, 2018), and specific types of cancers such as 
lung (Tseng et al., 2019), gastrointestinal, liver (Guo et al., 2020),

kidney, bladder, and colorectal cancer (Turner et al., 2017) has been 
consistently demonstrated in several studies. Furthermore, outdoor air 
pollution and particulate matter from outdoor air pollution have been 
classified as Group 1 carcinogens (carcinogenic to humans) by the In- 
ternational Agency for Research on Cancer based on sufficient evidence 
of carcinogenicity in humans and experimental animals and strong 
mechanistic evidence (Loomis et al., 2013). In contrast, green space has 
beneficial effects on physical and mental health by reducing exposure to 
air pollutants, noise, and excessive heat and providing psychological 
relaxation and stress alleviation (Van den Berg et al., 2015). Systematic 
reviews have provided strong evidence of the inverse association of 
surrounding greenness with all-cause mortality and mortality associated 
with cardiovascular diseases (Gascon et al., 2016; Rojas-Rueda et al., 
2019). In addition, higher neighborhood greenness exposure is linked to 
decreased risk of prostate cancer (Demoury et al., 2017; Iyer et al., 2020) 
and increased survival rate in lung cancer patients (Yang et al., 2021). 
A large body of literature has focused on epidemiological evidence of 
individual health effects of green space and air pollution. Nevertheless, 
there is a paucity of research regarding the interplay between green 
space and air pollution considering the inseparable nature of these two 
environmental health determinants in the real world. Specifically, 
although green space coverages are reported to have an inverse corre- 
lation with PM2.5 concentrations (Chen et al., 2019; Liu and Shen, 
2014), the interaction between these two metrics and its health impact 
are yet to be comprehensively explored. Moreover, the extent to which 
they are associated with specific cancer types remains unclear. A 
semi-individual cohort study in Germany showed that higher ambient 
air pollution levels increased the risk of mouth, throat, and 
non-melanoma skin cancers and that residential green space level had a 
possible protective effect against non-melanoma skin cancers (Datz- 
mann et al., 2018). However, comprehensive evidence regarding other 

We investigated the association among green space, air pollution, 
and incidence of different types of cancers in a cohort of 407,415 adults 
in Taiwan who were followed up prospectively for up to 16 years. The 
cohort was linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) and Causes of 
Death (COD) datasets. We aimed to explore the contributions of green 
space and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to the risk of specific cancers in 
terms of the most common cancers based on incidence or mortality rate 
in Taiwan and to ascertain the interaction between green space and 
PM2.5 and their role in cancer risk. 


We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study using data 
from the 2000–2015 Mei Jau (MJ) Health Examination Database, which 
is a large cohort in Taiwan that has been described in other publications 
(Wu et al., 2017). To obtain individual cancer and death records, this 
cohort was linked to the 2000–2015 TCR and COD datasets through 
encrypted personal identification by trained staff members from the 
Health and Welfare Data Science Center, Ministry of Health and Welfare. 
Among the 466,543 participants with three complete datasets, 
59,128 were excluded due to following reasons: cancer history before 
the health check-up from TCR and MJ (n = 2,692), date of primary 
cancer diagnosis or health check-up was after the date of death (n = 17), 
males patients with female genital cancer (n = 1), unavailability of 
cancer diagnosis data (n = 65), age <20 years (n = 14,392), and inad- 
equate data regarding estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 
(SGOT), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (CHOL), low-density

lipoprotein-cholesterol, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) (n = 41,961). 
Altogether, 407,415 participants were eligible for inclusion in the ana- 
lyses. A flowchart of the study participants is depicted in Fig. 1. The 
follow-up period was defined as the duration from the baseline to the 
diagnosis of cancer, death, or the end of the follow-up period (December 
31, 2015). Cancers were coded according to the International Classifi- 
cation of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition in the TCR (http://tcr.cph 
.ntu.edu.tw/main.php?Page=N1). In the COD dataset, COD was coded 
using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 before 2008 and 
ICD-10 from 2008. 

The predictors assessed in this study were the normalized difference 
vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2-year average PM2.5 at baseline. NDVI 
was used as an indicator of green space. The annual average NDVI data 
were computed and used for the year of the health checkup to link the 
data. Only the first health check-up data were linked to our exposure 
data. We extracted the mean values of NVDI within a radius of 500 m 
buffer of the participant’s residential address (geocoded into latitude 
and longitude) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradi- 
ometer vegetation index products at a high spatial resolution of 250 m × 
250 m (Lin et al., 2019). For each buffer, we used the zonal statistic 
function from ArcGIS ArcMap 10.3.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA, 
http://www.esri.com/) to compute the average NDVI in the intersected 
area between the corresponding buffer and the raster data of NDVI. 
Higher values indicate greater greenness (range from (cid:0) 1 to +1), while 
negative values indicate blue space or water. The 2-year average PM2.5 
was used as an indicator of long-term exposure, which was the average 
of the exposure calculated from the calendar year of the health exami- 
nation and the previous year. The details of the estimated PM2.5 expo- 
sure have been published in other articles (Lin et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 
2017). Briefly, PM2.5 at each participant’s reported address was esti- 
mated using a satellite-based spatiotemporal model based on the Na- 
tional Aeronautics and Space Administration aerosol optical depth data 
at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km. 

We selected the top ten cancer types based on the incidence or 
mortality rates in Taiwan from 2000 to 2015, with a total of 12 cancer 
types. Eight cancers (colon, female genital, liver, prostate, stomach, 
mouth, breast, and lung cancers) were in both the top ten cancer inci- 
dence and top ten cancer mortality rates. Four cancers were in either top 
ten cancer incidence (nasopharyngeal and endocrine gland cancers) or 
top ten cancer mortality (esophageal, and gallbladder and pancreatic 
cancers). 

The covariates were defined using baseline health examination data, 
which included variables such as (1) self-reported demographics: age, 
sex, education (senior high school and below or college and above), and 
region (stratified based on participants’ residence coordinates (town- 
ship): urban and rural); (2) anthropometrics: body mass index (<18.5, 
18.5–24, or ≥24 kg/m2) and percent body fat (TANITA body composi- 
tion analyzer; Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan); (3) self-reported comorbid- 
ities: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and 
stroke; (4) level of kidney function: defined in terms of eGFR (≥90, 
60–90, 45–60, or <45 mL/min/1.73 m2) (HITACHI 7150; Tokyo, Japan 
(before 2005)/TOSHIBA C8000; Toshiba Corporation, Tokyo, Japan 
(since 2005)); (5) urine test: urine protein and occult blood (ROCHE 
Miditron or Cobas U411; F. Hoff-mann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, 
Switzerland); (6) self-reported history of diseases: asthma, nephritis, and 
gout; (7) self-reported long-term use of medications: uric acid (UA) 
medications, antihyperlipidemics, asthma medications, and steroids; (8) 
self-reported health behaviors: cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, 
and physical activity; (9) biochemical values: ALP, SGOT, UA, TG, CHOL 
(HITACHI 7150; Tokyo, Japan (before 2005)/TOSHIBA C8000; Toshiba 
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan (since 2005)), and AFP (Abbott AxSYM or 
I2000; Abbott Park, Illinois, USA). 
All variables had 5% or less missing data. For all models, the analysis 
results were restricted to individuals with complete information on all 
covariates. 

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the participants’ 
baseline characteristics. The hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for cancer incidence within the 16-year follow-up period 
according to NDVI and PM2.5 were calculated using Cox proportional 
hazards models with a time-on-study scale. Since the dates of visits were 
available in the month-year format in the MJ database, we assumed the 
date as 15th of the month to obtain more precise estimates (Chuang 
et al., 2021; Woods et al., 2012). A confounder is a variable that in- 
fluences both independent and dependent variables, and should be 
excluded from the causal pathway related to the two variables. The se- 
lection of covariates was based on common sociodemographic variables 
regardless of their significance levels and all possible confounders based 
on the following selection process. First, Spearman’s rank correlation 
and analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests were used to analyze the rela- 
tionship between confounders and independent variables. Second, 
mediation analysis was used to determine whether a confounder lies in 
the causal pathway between independent and dependent variables. 
Third, Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the rela- 
tionship between confounders and dependent variables. Furthermore, 
we used the Change-in-Estimate (CIE) criterion with a 10% cut-off to 
check whether the model was affected by other unselected variables. 
The effect of interaction was also considered, and tested as multiplica- 
tive terms (independent variable × covariate) in the model. Further- 
more, logistic regression was used for mediation analysis to explore the 
role of PM2.5 on the association between NDVI and all or site-specific 
cancers. We used the following criteria to define a mediator: (a) a 
change in NDVI that significantly affected the changes in PM2.5, and (b) 
PM2.5 which was significantly associated with all or site-specific cancers 
(Valeri and VanderWeele, 2013). Total effect of exposure was decom- 
posed into a natural direct effect (NDE) and a natural indirect effect 
(NIE). The NDE represents the effect of NDVI on all or site-specific 
cancers. NIE represents an association between NDVI and all or 
site-specific cancers, which could be explained by the association of 
NDVI with PM2.5. To obtain valid estimates of NIE, we adjusted for 
potential NDVI–all or site-specific cancer confounders, NDVI–PM2.5 
confounders, and PM2.5–all or site-specific cancer confounders, which 
included demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, health behav- 
iors, biochemical data, and environmental factors. Screening for con- 
founders followed the same rules. All analyses were performed using 
SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Statistically 
significant consider as p < 0.05. 


Baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1. The mean age was 39.5 
± 12.8 years. The proportion of female participants was slightly greater 
(53.5%) and the majority of the individuals had higher levels of edu- 
cation (63.0%). The mean NDVI and PM2.5 were 0.35 ± 0.12 and 20.89 
± 5.74 μg/m3, respectively. 
During a median follow-up of 10.37 years (males: 10.45 years, fe- 
males: 10.37 years), 11,576 participants were diagnosed with cancer at 
a mean age of 50.50 ± 14.10. The age-standardized incidence rate for all 
cancers was 244.91 per 100,000 population (males: 236.32 per 100,000

population and females: 251.79 per 100,000 population). The incidence 
rates of all cancers and each type of cancer are shown in Table 2. 

Covariate-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (Fig. 2) showed 
that the 2-year average PM2.5 concentration with every 10 μg/m3 in- 
crease at baseline was significantly associated with the incidence of 
stomach cancer (HR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.58), endocrine gland cancer 
(HR: 2.13, 95% CI: 1.39–3.26), breast cancer (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 
1.03–1.22), lung cancer (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01–1.24), and all cancers 
(HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.15). NDVI at every 0.1-unit increase at 
baseline was significantly associated with the incidence of prostate 
cancer (HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88–0.99) and lung cancer (HR: 0.95, 95% 
CI: 0.91–0.99). The results for other cancers (nonsignificant) are pre- 
sented in Figs. A.1-A.2. The details of the multivariate model of all 
cancers and site-specific cancers are shown in Tables A.1-A.30. 
We elucidated the relationship between NDVI, PM2.5, and the risk of 
cancer via interaction tests and mediation analyses. There was no sig- 
nificant interaction effect for NDVI × PM2.5 (p > 0.05). The results of 
mediation analysis showed that NDVI influenced the incidence of 
prostate and all cancers by reducing PM2.5, with a natural indirect effect 
of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01–1.02, full mediation), and 1.03 (95% CI: 
1.00–1.05, partial mediation), respectively. Table A.31 demonstrates 
the demographics-adjusted mediation effects of mediators on the asso- 
ciation between NDVI and lung and prostate cancer risks, and on the 
association between PM2.5, and stomach and breast cancer risks. 
We examined the interaction between environmental exposure and 
covariates (Table 3). We found that the effect of NDVI on prostate cancer 
varied with physical activity (p for interaction = 0.033). The effects of 
PM2.5 were shown as follows: on all cancer, they varied with cigarette 
smoking (p for interaction <0.001) and alcohol consumption (p for 
interaction = 0.006); on stomach cancer, they varied with education (p 
for interaction = 0.079, borderline significant) and alcohol consumption 
(p for interaction = 0.008); on endocrine gland and lung cancer, they 
varied with cigarette smoking (p for interactions were 0.039 and 0.077, 
respectively); on breast cancer, they varied with region (urban/rural) (p 
for interaction = 0.080, borderline significant). We further conducted 
stratified analysis using moderators to assess the association between 
environmental exposures and site-specific cancers, and the results are 
shown in Figure A.3. 
Furthermore, given that education (as a proxy for socioeconomic 
status) and urban-rural differences could have potential implications in 
the association between environmental exposure and cancer incidence, 
we further performed a stratified analysis, although they were not sta- 
tistically significant moderators (Table A.32-33). 

In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the associations 
between long-term environmental exposure to PM2.5, green space 
exposure, and cancer incidence in Taiwan. We observed that PM2.5 
exposure was an independent risk factor for the incidence of all cancers, 
lung cancer, endocrine gland cancer, stomach cancer, and breast cancer. 
Green space exposure was a protective factor against the incidence of 
prostate cancer and lung cancers. And NDVI is an indirect protective 
factor for all cancer with the link being fully mediated by the PM2.5 
concentrations. This may imply that environmental greening is a prac- 
ticable strategy to reduce the incidence of all cancer. 
Airborne particulate matter, a complex mixture containing various 
carcinogens and endocrine disrupting chemicals, adversely affects 
cellular health via several mechanisms such as oxidative stress and 
inflammation, thus increasing the risk of cancer (Loomis et al., 2013; 
Valavanidis et al., 2008). The hormone properties of the pollutants may 
induce aberrant endocrine stimulation (Darbre, 2018), corresponding to 
the increased risk of endocrine gland cancer with high PM2.5 exposure in 
our study. Several epidemiological studies have shown that higher PM2.5 
exposure is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (Yu et al., 
2021). A consistent result was obtained in our study. Given the strong 
relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk, evidence 
that PM2.5 is associated with lung cancer incidence in never-smokers

may be more convincing. Our study observed and obtained consistent 
results in never-smokers. In addition, we found that long-term exposure 
to PM2.5 increased stomach cancer risk, which were in accordance with 
prior research. Specifically, a previous study showed an increase of 5.0 
μg/m3 PM2.5 increased gastric cancer risk by 38% (Nagel et al., 2018). In 
addition, the Cancer Prevention Study II demonstrated a significant 
positive associations of near-source PM2.5 and stomach cancer mortality 
(Turner et al., 2017). The bioaccumulation of air pollutants in the 
gastrointestinal tract through inhalation and pulmonary absorption, or 
intaking through mucociliary clearance may give rise to genomic 
instability and elevated stomach cancer risk. In recent years, the asso- 
ciation between air pollution and breast cancer incidence has attracted 
attention. Previous research has shown that exposure to PM2.5-bound 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is associated with breast cancer due to 
its estrogenic characteristics and DNA damage response to oxidative 
stress (Chen et al., 2013; White et al., 2019). However, the results from 
some studies are not consistent. A nationwide prospective cohort study 
conducted in the US found that PM2.5 exposure was associated with the 
incidence of breast cancer, but it varied according to geographic loca- 
tion (White et al., 2019). Nevertheless, another cohort study (Nurses’ 
Health Study II) from the US found no significant evidence to support 
this hypothesis (Hart et al., 2016). A study involving 15 cohorts from 
nine European countries found only suggestive evidence of an associa- 
tion between PM2.5 and the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer 
(HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.77–1.51) (Andersen et al., 2017). Our study sup- 
ports the hypothesis that higher PM2.5 exposure increases the risk of 




Green space has potential beneficial effects on human mental and 
physical health through three possible pathways (Markevych et al., 
2017). (1) The high density of trees and vegetation decreases noise, heat, 
and air pollutant concentrations. (2) Living in areas with more green 
spaces might increase the motivation for physical activity. (3) Exposure 
to green spaces improves and restores psychophysiological health. In 
recent years, several studies have suggested that living in areas with 
high greenness is associated with a decrease in adverse health effects 
such as all-cause mortality, incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory 
diseases and associated mortality, and mortality associated with breast, 
prostate, skin, lung, and all cancers (Coleman et al., 2021; Fong et al., 
2018; Gascon et al., 2016). However, a limited number of studies have 
evaluated the association between green space exposure and cancer 
incidence. A 27-year follow-up cohort study (the GAZEL study involving 
employees of the French National Utility for Energy Production and 
Distribution recruited in 1989) found that the risks of all cancers 
increased with an increase in green space (NDVI at 100 m), but green 
space was a protective factor against breast cancer (Zare Sakhvidi et al., 
2021). A population-based, multi-centric, case-control study in Spain 
(the MCC-Spain study) suggested that living in urban green spaces 
within a 300 m buffer was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer 
whereas living in agricultural areas within a 300 m buffer was associated 
with an increased risk of breast cancer (O’Callaghan-Gordo et al., 2018). 
A cohort study in Germany reported the protective effects of green space 
against mouth and throat cancer and non-melanoma skin cancers 
(Datzmann et al., 2018). Nevertheless, we have no evidence to support 
the association between green space and the incidence of breast or 
mouth cancer. The results are inconsistent, perhaps due to differences in 
the study designs, exposure assessment methods, and geographical 
contexts of the studies. However, our study is one of the few large 
population-based cohort studies that focused on the association between 
greenness and cancer incidence and provided evidence that greenness 
has a protective effect against the incidence of cancer, especially lung 
and prostate cancer. The mitigating effect of green space on lung cancer 
risk is mainly a reduction in air pollution. With less inhaled toxicants 
reaching the lung tissue, the burden of genetic and epigenetic responses 
leading to tumorigenesis is curtailed (Shahadin et al., 2018). Our find- 
ings corroborate those of a population-based case-control study con- 
ducted by Demoury et al. suggesting that men living in greener areas had 
a lower risk of prostate cancer (Demoury et al., 2017). There is unclear 
evidence of how green space influences prostate cancer; however, our 
mediation analysis indicated that percent body fat and uric acid may 
play important mediating roles in this association. Previous studies have 
shown an association between visceral obesity evaluated using 
computed tomography (CT) and prostate cancer risk (Von Hafe et al., 
2004). The mechanisms of adipocytokine secretion by visceral fat cells, 
steroid hormone disturbances, and elevated insulin levels may account 
for this association (Gann et al., 1996; Stattin et al., 2001). Interestingly, 
serum uric acid levels were positively correlated with visceral fat 
(Rospleszcz et al., 2020), highlighting the importance of further explo- 
ration of uric acid metabolism, body fat distribution, and carcinogenesis. 
Our study has several limitations. First, the PM2.5 exposure and NDVI 
were calculated based on the residential locations of patients; as a result, 
information regarding exposure during daily activities or occupations 
was not available. Second, our study consisted of participants with a 
higher socioeconomic status due to the self-paid nature of the health 
checkup. However, this cohort is representative of the general popula- 
tion of Taiwan in terms of the prevalence of risk factors, incidence, and 
mortality rates of cancer (Wu et al., 2017). Third, the extrapolation of 
short-term or recent air pollution data to long-term PM exposure has 
proven to be valid in previous studies due to the strong correlation in 
annual exposure among different geographical locations (Brook et al., 
2010). This claim was supported by our sensitivity analysis 
(Figure A.4–5). We calculated cumulative environmental exposure for 
all participants during follow-up as a predictor of site-specific cancer 
incidence. However, it is of concern that 55% of participants only have 
one visit (baseline); therefore, we needed to assume that they did not 
move so as to calculate the cumulative environmental exposure. Fourth, 
due to the limitations of secondary data, it is difficult for us to control for 
every possible confounder, such as reproductive factors and social 
cohesion, in the Cox proportional hazards models and mediation 
analysis. 
Finally, NDVI, a large-scale green space indicator, could not accu- 
rately estimate greenness if the participants had small gardens or their 
houses were adjacent to certain large green spaces. Therefore, to clarify 
the health benefits of greening, it is necessary to further investigate the 
effect of greening on cancer using small-scale indicators or greening 
types such as street trees, private planting, parks, and farmland. 

Long-term PM2.5 exposure is a possible risk factor for the incidence of 
all cancers and four site-specific cancers: endocrine gland cancer, 
stomach cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer. Green space may play a 
protective role against the incidence of lung cancer and prostate cancer. 
Furthermore, higher green space exposure is associated with a lowering 
risk of all cancers by diluting the direct health impacts of PM2.5. 
Increasing access to green spaces in residential neighborhoods may 
provide positive health outcomes and improve public health.
