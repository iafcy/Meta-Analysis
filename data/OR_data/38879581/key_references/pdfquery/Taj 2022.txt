ABSTRACT 
◥ 
Background: The incidence rate risk of testicular cancer has 
increased over the last four decades, and the most signiﬁcant 
increase has been among Caucasian men in Nordic countries. 
Second-generation immigrant studies indicate a signiﬁcant role of 
environmental exposure in testicular cancer. 
Methods: We conducted a nationwide register-based case– 
control study including 6,390 testicular cancer cases registered in 
the Danish Cancer Registry between 1989 and 2014. Up to four age- 
matched controls for each case (n ¼ 18,997) were randomly selected 
from the Civil Registration System. Ambient air pollution levels were 
estimated at addresses of cases and controls with a state-of-the-art air 
pollution modeling system. 
Results: We mostly found ORs close to 1.00 and with 95% 
conﬁdence intervals (CI) spanning 1.00. Exposure during the 
year preceding birth was associated with ORs for nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2) of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97) per 10 mg/m3 and 
for organic carbon of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.72–0.98) per 1 mg/m3. 
Exposure during the ﬁrst 10 years of life was associated with ORs 
for organic carbon of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67–0.93) per 1 mg/m3, 
for ozone (O3) of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.07–1.34) per 10 mg/m3, and for 
secondary inorganic aerosols of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00–1.15) per 
1 mg/m3. 
Conclusions: Early-life exposure to NO2 and organic carbon 
(OC) was associated with lower risk for testicular cancer whereas 
early-life exposure to O3 and secondary inorganic aerosols (SIA) 
was associated with higher risk. 
Impact: We report both positive and negative associations 
between ambient air pollutants and risk of testicular cancer, depen- 
dent on pollutant, exposure time window, and age at diagnosis. This 
is the ﬁrst study to investigate such associations. 

Testicular cancer is rare and accounts for 1% of all cancers in men, 
but it has public health signiﬁcance because it is the most common 
cancer among men aged 15 to 40 (1). The risk of testicular cancer has 
increased over the last four decades and the most signiﬁcant increase 
has been among Caucasian men in Nordic countries (2). The incidence 
rates in Nordic countries (primarily Caucasians) is 11.5 per 100,000 
men, whereas those among Black and Asian men are 1 to 2 per 
100,000 (3, 4). There are two main types of testicular cancer, germ 
cell and non–germ cell tumors (5). Germ cell tumors are derived from 
multi-potential germ cells, mainly teratomas, and seminoma, and 
account for 97% of all testicular cancers, whereas non–germ cell 
tumors are derived from testis’ support cells and represent 3% of all 
testicular cancers. The testicular cancer patient often presents with 
either painless enlargement of testis or symptoms related to metastases

such as hemoptysis from lung deposits or endocrine effects such as 
gynecomastia. Due to recent advances in diagnosis and treatment 
options, the prognosis of testicular cancer is very good, even after 
metastases (6). 
The main known risk factor for developing testicular cancers is 
cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis; testicular cancer 
risk increases ﬁve to 10 times among men born with cryptorchidism as 
compared to others (7, 8). Other risk factors include Klinefelter 
syndrome, which is the most common sex chromosome abnormality 
in which the affected male carries an additional X chromosome (9). 
This additional X chromosome results in hypogonadism and an 
increased risk of testicular cancer (10). Family history of testicular 
cancer among ﬁrst-degree relatives (father and brothers; refs. 11–13), 
Caucasian men (14), human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infec- 
tion (15), body height (16), and a history of inguinal hernia (17) are 
other established risk factors of testicular cancer. 
Increasing incidence rates of testicular cancer over the last four 
decades suggests that environmental exposure and lifestyle have an 
essential role in the testis cancer etiology. The increasing incidence of 
testicular cancer among young adults also suggests that early-life 
exposure may be important for disease development. Swedish and 
Danish second-generation immigrant studies reported testicular can- 
cer risk to be similar to the country of residence and not that of their 
parents (18, 19), which also points at environmental and or lifestyle as 
important for testis cancer etiology. Nevertheless, no prior study has 
investigated a possible link between ambient air pollution exposure 
and the risk of testicular cancer. 
Several animal and human studies have investigated the effect of air 
pollution exposure as a hormone disruptor (20) and on male infer- 
tility (21), and both hormone disruptors and male infertility can 
increase the risk of testicular cancer (22). Human studies analyzing 
presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in blood samples of young 

Long-term Residential Exposure to Air Pollution and Risk 
of Testicular Cancer in Denmark: A Population-Based 
Case–Control Study

males reported a signiﬁcant association with testicular cancer (23–25). 
Fetal exposure to pollutants, especially those that can act as hormone 
disruptors and mimic the estrogen effect, can increase the risk of germ 
cell tumors (26). Diesel exhaust particles encompass various sub- 
stances with estrogenic and antiandrogen properties, and exposure, 
especially during fetal life, can increase the risk of testicular cancer in 
mice (27). Occupational and residential exposure to pollutants with 
hormone disrupter characteristics have shown mixed results. Occu- 
pational exposure to 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-ethylene (28) and residential 
exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (23) was associated with 
increase the risk of testicular germ cell cancer, but other studies did 
not show similar results (29, 30). 
Exposure to ambient air pollution has been negatively associated 
with sperm morphology in animal and human studies (31). A respi- 
rable fraction of particulate matter can act as a transporter for proven 
endocrine disruptor polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (32), which 
can negatively affect spermatogenesis directly or via the hypothalamic- 
pituitary axis (33) but a further link with an increased risk of testicular 
cancer has not been established. Long-term exposure to air pollution, 
speciﬁcally nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter 
(PM), can trigger oxidative stress and chronic inﬂammatory reac- 
tions (34). Long-term high level of oxidative stress can results in low 
sperm quality and quantity via lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and 
oxidation of proteins in spermatozoa (35). Testicular cancer risk is 
high among men with abnormal semen characteristics (36). 
Based on the previous observations of air pollutants with hormone 
disrupting characteristics and causing oxidative stress and chronic 
inﬂammation, we hypothesized that air pollution is associated with the 
incidence of testicular cancer. The aim of the present study was to 
investigate if outdoor air pollution at the residence is associated with 
the risk of testicular cancer. 
Materials and Methods 
Study population 
We conducted a register-based matched case–control study based 
on the entire Danish population. We identiﬁed all patients diagnosed 
with testicular cancer between 1989 and 2014, aged 20 years or older at 
the time of diagnosis, and without a previous cancer diagnosis, 
including a previous testicular cancer, in the Danish Cancer Regis- 
try (37); we accepted a previous diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin 
cancer. We used the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases 10 
(ICD-10) codes C62.0–C62.9 to identify testicular cancer patients. 
Four age-matched (year/month of birth) controls, free of previous 
cancer diagnosis (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), and alive at the 
date of diagnosis of their cases (index date), were randomly selected 
and matched to each case. Controls were selected from all eligible male 
individuals in the Danish Civil Registration System (38). 

Using the unique 10-digit identiﬁcation numbers, we extracted all 
the study participants’ residential addresses from January 1, 1979, to 
December 31, 2014, from the Danish Civil Registration System (38). 
Geographical coordinates at the residential address’s front door were 
attained using municipality code, street, and house number. All 
addresses were geocoded within 5 m from the front door using the 
Danish address database. We estimated the annual mean concentra- 
tion of PM2.5, PM2.5 constituents, NO2, O3, and sulphur dioxide (SO2) 
using the high-resolution multiscale air pollution model system 
DEHM/UBM/AirGIS. The DEHM/UBM/AirGIS model was 
described in detail previously (39). 
In summary, DEHM/UBM/AirGIS combines three models to 
estimate air pollution levels at a location: (i) The Danish Eulerian 
Hemispheric Model (DEHM), which calculates regional background 
concentrations due to long-range transport (40, 41). DEHM estimates 
both natural and anthropogenic emissions of gases and particles and 
their precursors. DEHM uses a 3D large-scale chemistry transport 
model with a spatial resolution of 5.6 km (cid:2) 5.6 km to estimate regional 
long-range transport. DEHM also estimates chemical reactions, atmo- 
spheric transport, and dispersion of pollutants and the deduction 
processes in the atmosphere, such as transport dispersion and depo- 
sition. DEHM models the primary particles [mineral dust, black 
carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and sea-salt], the secondary 
inorganic aerosols (SIA) including ammonium (NH4), sulphate (SO4), 
and nitrate (NO3) in their different chemical forms, and the secondary 
organic aerosols (SOA) generated from gaseous organic precursors 
such as volatile organic compounds (VOC), isoprene, etc.; (ii) The 
Urban Background Model (UBM) uses the SPREAD emission mod- 
el (42) to estimates contribution from an urban area (39, 43–45) using 
an average building cover and height for a 1 km (cid:2) 1 km resolution over 
Denmark. The UBM estimates the local urban emissions of NOx and 
primarily emitted particles originating from all sources (e.g., trafﬁc and 
residential heating) and also takes into account the regional back- 
ground concentrations modeled with DEHM (46, 47); and (iii) The 
Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM), which models local air 
pollution levels using trafﬁc intensity, speed, and distribution of 
vehicle types to calculates contributions from the local trafﬁc in the 
address street (48). The OSPM also accounts for the detailed infor- 
mation on the street and geometry of buildings surrounding the 
street (49). OSPM estimates air pollution at a 2-m height at addresses 
in streets with 500 or more vehicles per day. Comparisons between 
model predictions and measured concentrations show correlation 
coefﬁcients between 0.62 and 0.92 for the different pollutants (Sup- 
plementary Materials and Methods, text 1). We refer to the Supple- 
mentary Materials and Methods for more details about the air pol- 
lution model system concerning sources of uncertainty, spatial reso- 
lution, and main sources of the pollutants. 
We used the average concentrations of air pollutants weighted by 
the time living at each address during the relevant period. We 
calculated such time-weighted averages (TWA) of air pollution con- 
centrations over four time periods: the 1 year before birth, the ﬁrst 
10 years of life, 10 to 20 years before the index date (10 years lag), and 
the last 10 years before the index date. Participants with missing 
exposure information for 20% or more of the relevant exposure time 
window were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis. For periods with 
missing exposure for less than 20% of the time, the TWA was 
calculated for the period with known exposure. 


Using the 10-digit unique personal identiﬁcation number (PIN; 
ref. 39), information on potential confounders, both at individual and 
parish levels, was extracted from the registries of Statistics Denmark. 
The individual-level data included marital 
(cohabiting, 
divorced, and never married), disposable income (calendar year 
speciﬁc quantiles), and attachment to the labor market (blue-collar, 
lower white-collar, higher white-collar, unemployed, retired). Socio- 
demographic data were also retrieved at the parish level from Statistics 
Denmark. We obtained yearly data for the proportion of households 
living in rented dwellings, the proportion of inhabitants with a manual 
profession, and the proportion of inhabitants with disposable income 
in the lower quintile. In 2017, in Denmark, 2160 parishes existed with 
an average area of 16.2 km2 (range 0.1–126.2) and a median number of 




1,032 inhabitants (range approximately 33–36,000). We used individ- 
ual and parish level values corresponding to 1 year before the index 
date to minimize the risk of prediagnostic symptoms inﬂuencing 
sociodemographic variables. We selected the sociodemographic fac- 
tors based on availability and also because these factors might captures 
variation in (unknown) environmental/societal factors, which could be 
responsible for changes in testicular cancer incidence rates. We also 
extracted health data to identify individuals with HIV infection, born 
with cryptorchidism, or any congenital malformation of male genital. 


logistic regression analyses to assess the 
associations between exposure to different pollutants and testicular 
cancer and estimated ORs with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). We 
adjust for potential confounders in three (cid:1)a priori determined models: 
Model 1 adjusted for age and calendar time by the matched design; 
model 2 further adjusted for individual-level characteristics, including 
cohabiting status, disposable income, and attachment to the labor 
market. model 3 (our main model) further adjusted for manual labor, 
income, and homeownership at the neighborhood level. Results for all 
three models are given in the supplementary materials and methods; 
due to minor differences in results for the three models we present only 
results from model 3 in the manuscript text. We performed analysis for 
TWA exposures of all pollutants over four time periods: the 1 year 
before birth, the ﬁrst 10 years of life, 10 to 20 years before the index date 
(10 years lag), and the last 10 years before index date. We also analyzed 
if the risk differs for older (≥36 years) and younger (≤35 years) age 
group testicular cancer patients because the incidence rates for tes- 
ticular cancer is higher for the age group 20 to 35 years than for those 
35þ years indicating that different etiologies might be in play; we 
tested a possible interaction by introducing an interaction term with a 
dichotomous variable indicating the age group. We tested deviation 
from linearity by comparing a decile model with a linear model 
using the likelihood ratio test; the P values ranged between 0.13 and 
0.68 indicating no deviation from linearity based on the “last 10- 
year” exposure time window; thus, we ﬁtted linear models. The 
uncertainty of the exposure model might have been higher in the 
early period (supplementary materials and methods). Therefore, we 
estimated risk for testicular cancer for those diagnosed 1989–1999 
and 2000–2014 separately. All statistical analyses were performed in 
R version 3.2.1. 

This study was conducted using data from Statistics Denmark. Data 
are available with the permission of Statistics Denmark (https://www. 
dst.dk/da). 

We identiﬁed 6,941 eligible cases and 22,594 eligible age-matched 
controls for the analysis of exposure during the last 10 years before 
diagnosis. We excluded cases (n ¼ 105) and controls (n ¼ 103) with 
history of cryptorchidism, cases (n ¼ 10) and controls (n ¼ 7) born 
with congenital malformation of male genital, cases (n ¼ 34) 
and controls (n ¼ 52) with a history of HIV. We further excluded 
cases (n ¼ 305) and controls (n ¼ 1,618) with missing exposure 
information for more than 20% of the 10 years preceding index date, 
and cases (n ¼ 74) and controls (n ¼ 261) with a missing value for 
any covariate. Finally, after the above exclusions, we excluded cases 
(n ¼ 23) and controls (n ¼ 1,556) for whom no matched case or control 
was available resulting in 6,390 cases and 18,997 matched controls 
for analysis of exposure during the last 10 years before diagnosis 
(Supplementary Table S1). 
Table 1 shows sociodemographic characteristics of cases and 
controls. Over 60% of the study population was aged 40 or below; 
income, marital status, and attachment to the labor market were 
similar between cases and controls. Study participants’ area-level 
sociodemographic characteristics were also similar for cases and 
controls. The 10-year TWA concentrations of pollutants were 
similar among cases and controls with a mean exposure among 
controls of 21.75 mg/m3 for NO2, 13.63 mg/m3 for SO2, 58.99 mg/m3 
O3, 18.20 mg/m3 for PM2.5, 0.85 mg/m3 for BC, 1.51 mg/m3 for OC, 
0.31 mg/m3 for SOA, 8.34 mg/m3 for SIA, 1.52 mg/m3 for NH4, 
3.71 mg/m3 for NO3, 3.11 mg/m3 for SO4, and 4.10 mg/m3 for sea-salt 
(Table 2; Supplementary Fig. S1). 
Spearman correlation coefﬁcients between air pollutants among 
controls are reported in Supplementary Table S2 and shows that 
PM2.5 was strongly correlated with secondary inorganic aerosols 
(Rs ¼ 0.94) and its constituents NH4 (Rs ¼ 0.87), NO3 (Rs ¼ 
0.90), SO4 (Rs ¼ 0.94), and SO2 (Rs ¼ 0.95). O3 was negatively 
associated with NO2 (Rs ¼ (cid:3)0.98), BC (Rs ¼ (cid:3)0.91), OC (Rs ¼ (cid:3)0.84), 
PM2.5 (Rs ¼ (cid:3)0.54), SOA (Rs ¼ (cid:3)0.61), SIA (Rs ¼ (cid:3)0.28), and its 
constituents. 
Table 3 shows associations between risk for testicular cancer and 
exposure to air pollution during four different time windows. ORs in 
association with exposure during the last 10 years before diagnosis 
were close to 1.00 and with CIs spanning 1.00 (Table 3); adjustment 
had minor inﬂuence on these ORs (Supplementary Table SS3). The 
results were similar for those diagnosed between 1989 and 1999 and 
2000 and 2014 (Supplementary Table SS4), and for exposure during 10 
to 20 years before diagnosis (10-y lag; Table 3). Table 3 also shows that 
exposure during the year preceding birth was associated with ORs 
for NO2 of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97) per 10 mg/m3 and for OC of 0.84 
(95% CI, 0.72–0.98) per 1 mg/m3. Exposure during the ﬁrst 10 years 
of life was associated with ORs for OC of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67–0.93) per 
1 mg/m3, for O3 of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.07–1.34) per 10 mg/m3, and for SIA 
of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00–1.15) per 1 mg/m3. 
The primarily emitted carbonaceous particles showed higher ORs 
in association with testicular cancer in the older (> ¼ 36 years) than 
in the younger age group (< ¼ 35 years); ORs for OC were 
1.20 among the older and 0.90 among the younger (P for interaction 
between OC exposure and age group: 0.05). For the other air 
pollutants, the conﬁdence intervals around the ORs for the younger 
and older age groups widely overlapped (Table 4). Supplementary 
Fig. S2 shows spline plots of associations between air pollution and 
risk for testicular cancer. 

In this large population-based case–control study, we found no 
overall association between outdoor air pollution at the residence the 
last decades before the diagnosis and the risk of testicular cancer. 
Exposure to NO2 and OC the year before birth and the ﬁrst 10 years of 
life was associated with lower risk of testicular cancer whereas exposure 
to O3 and SIA during the ﬁrst 10 years of lift was associated with a 
higher risk of testicular cancer. Exposure to OC during the last 10 years 
before the diagnosis was associated with higher risk for testicular 
cancer diagnosed after 35 years of age. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to investigate a 
possible association between residential outdoor air pollution and the 
incidence of testicular cancer. Second-generation immigrant studies 
from Denmark (19) and Finland (50) reported similar testicular cancer

risk to the country of residence. In contrast, the ﬁrst-generation 
immigrants maintained the risk of testicular cancer observed in their 
country of origin. Thus, environmental factors might play a role in the 
etiology of testicular cancer. Our study indicates that if air pollution 
plays a role, early exposure (ﬁrst 10 years of life) to primary air 
pollution from local sources (indicated by NO2, BC, and OC) might 
be associated with a lower risk for testicular cancer whereas early 
exposure to secondary pollutants (indicated by O3 and SIA) might be 
associated with a higher risk. Late exposure (last 10 years before 
diagnosis) to OC might be associated with higher risk for testicular 
cancer among those diagnosed after age 35 but not among those 
diagnosed at younger ages. These results were based on multiple 
analyses of combinations of pollutant, exposure time window, and 
age group and we cannot exclude that they are a result of chance. It 
seems counterintuitive that exposure to some air pollutants reduces the 
risk of testicular cancer, which speaks against a causal interpretation of 
our ﬁndings for early exposure to primary air pollution from local 
sources. Since this is the ﬁrst study on air pollution and risk of testicular 
cancer, a comparison with the results of future studies would qualify 
the interpretation of our ﬁndings. 
We modeled air pollution, which is inevitable associated with some 
degree of exposure misclassiﬁcation. However, the DEHM/UBM/ 
AirGIS air pollution modeling system used in our study has been 
successfully validated and predicts both temporal and geographical 
variation in air pollution well (Supplementary Materials and Methods; 
refs. 41, 50). We would expect that the model predicts air pollution 
more precisely in the later than in the early period (Supplementary 
Materials and Methods), but the results for cases diagnosed between 
1989 and 1999 were similar to those for cases diagnosed between 2000 
and 2014. We were unable to assess air pollution exposure at locations 
other than the residential address, such as occupational exposure, 
during commuting or indoors. We would expect the inevitable mis- 
classiﬁcation to be nondifferential and, therefore, it might have moved 
the risk estimates towards null. 
Our study’s major strengths include use of the virtually complete 
and reliable nation-wide Danish registries providing a nearly perfect 
frame for case identiﬁcation, control selection, and identiﬁcation of 
present and historical addresses. It was a strength of the study to 
identify and exclude cases and controls with a history of cryptorchi- 
dism, born with congenital malformation of male genitals, and Kli- 
nefelter syndrome. These conditions are well-established risk factors 
for testicular cancer. We cannot exclude that air pollution would affect 
the risk for testicular cancer differently among those with and without 
these condition and we excluded individuals with the conditions to 
avoid their potential inﬂuence on our risk estimates. We were also able 
to restrict our cases and controls to individuals with no prior history of 
cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer); this further minimized risk 
of bias related to cancer therapy or change in lifestyle after a cancer

diagnosis. We restricted our study population to individuals born in 
Denmark, which ensured information about full residential history. 
We had no information about individual level factors such as 
smoking, diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, body weight, 
and occupational exposure. None of these, however, are established 
risk factor for testicular cancer, but should they be risk factors and 
should they be associated with air pollution as well, then confounding 
from such factors cannot be excluded. We could not account for family 
history of testicular cancer, in utero exposure to estrogen, and history 
of inguinal hernia. In utero exposure to estrogen is a rare condition and 
occurs during unplanned pregnancy when the expecting mother uses 
oral contraceptive. Oral contraceptive, in a real-life condition of use, it 
is about 92% effective (51); still, only a small proportion of the few 
women getting pregnant while using oral contraceptives are likely to

bNumbers differ from the 6,390 cases and 18,997 controls included in the analyses of exposure during the last 10 years before diagnosis. That is because our exposure 
assessment started in 1979, which left “early” cases without information about exposure. For example, for exposure during the year before birth, participants born 
prior to 1980 were excluded (5,710 cases; 17,187 controls). In addition, participants with missing exposure more than 20% of the year preceding birth were excluded 
(20 cases; 74 controls).

give birth. Thus, any bias due to this is probably very small. Inguinal 
hernia can increase testicular cancer risk (52) but in Denmark, all 
residents have universal, free access to health care, making it unlikely 
that such operation is associated with air pollution. 
Air pollution concentrations in Denmark are relatively low when 
compared with many other European countries, and not least when 
compared with many cities in developing countries. We cannot 
exclude that associations which were undetected in our study, 
would exist and be detectable in populations exposed to higher air 
pollution levels. 

We found that early life exposure to NO2 and OC was associated 
with lower risk for testicular cancer whereas early life exposure to O3 
and SIA was associated with higher risk. Exposure to OC during the 
last 10 years before diagnosis was associated with higher risk for 
testicular cancer diagnosed after age 35. These ﬁndings might be due to 
chance and need replication in future studies.
