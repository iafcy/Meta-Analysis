Background and aims: A landﬁll, an incinerator, and a reﬁnery plant have been operating since the early 
1960s in a contaminated site located in the suburb of Rome (Italy). To evaluate their potential health 
effects, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using dispersion modeling for 
exposure assessment. 
Methods: A ﬁxed cohort was enrolled in the Rome Longitudinal Study in 2001, mortality and hospitali- 
zations were followed-up until 2010. Exposure assessments to the landﬁll (H2S), the incinerator (PM10), 
and the reﬁnery plant (SOX) were performed for each subject using a Lagrangian dispersion model. In- 
dividual and small-area variables were available (including exposures levels to NO2 from trafﬁc and 
diesel trucks). Cox regression analysis was performed (hazard ratios, HRs, 95% CI) using linear terms for 
the exposures (5th–95th percentiles difference). Single and bi-pollutant models were run. 
Results: The cohort included 85,559 individuals. The estimated annual average exposures levels were 
correlated. H2S from the landﬁll was associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both genders 
(HR 1.04 95% CI 1.00–1.09 in women); PM10 from the incinerator was associated with pancreatic cancer 
mortality in both genders (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.03–1.90 in men, HR 1.47 95% CI 1.12–1.93 in women) and with 
breast morbidity in women (HR 1.13 95% CI 1.00–1.27). SOx from the reﬁnery was associated with lar- 
yngeal cancer mortality in women (HR 4.99 95% CI 1.64–15.9) and respiratory hospital admissions (HR 
1.13 95% CI 1.01–1.27). 
Conclusions: We found an association of the pollution sources with some cancer forms and cardio-re- 
spiratory diseases. Although there was a high correlation between the estimated exposures, an indication 
of speciﬁc effects from the different sources emerged. 



In the Malagrotta area, located in the suburb of Rome (Italy), a 
large landﬁll for municipal solid waste (MSW), an incinerator of 
medical wastes, and a petrochemical reﬁnery are situated within 
just a few kilometers of each other. Limited evidence of increased 
risk of cancer has been suggested among people living close to 
incinerators (Porta et al., 2009; Forastiere et al., 2011; WHO, 2007) 
and several uncertainties limit the interpretation of the available 
epidemiological studies on landﬁlls (Porta et al., 2009). There is no 
clear indication that living close to a reﬁnery is associated with 
cancer incidence or cause-speciﬁc mortality (Simonsen et al., 
2010). An old study suggested an increase in lung cancer mortality

among women living close to major industries (Bhopal et al., 
1998), while a more recent study (Cirera et al., 2013) has docu- 
mented an association with haematological cancers. 
Most of the studies conducted in contaminated sites have 
methodological problems, including the use of health data at the 
aggregate level, the limited possibility of adjusting for socio- 
economic status, (Floret et al., 2003; Viel et al., 2008) or the dis- 
tance from the source used as a proxy for population exposure. In 
2011, the European Environmental Agency (EEA) suggested ap- 
plying dispersion models to provide a better exposure assessment 
(European Environmental Agency, 2014). Recently, an assessment 
of air pollution exposure from incinerator emissions was per- 
formed in the UK and a review on exposure assessment methods 
in epidemiological studies of incinerators was published (Ash- 
worth et al., 2013; Cordioli et al., 2013). 





Previous studies conducted in the Malagrotta area detected an 
excess of stomach cancer among workers at the medical waste 
incinerator and an increase of lung, bladder, brain cancers and 
multiple myeloma among petroleum reﬁnery workers (Rapiti 
et al., 1997; Lo Presti et al., 2001). A study on the resident popu- 
lation did not indicate an excess mortality in people living close to 
the landﬁll, except for laryngeal cancer among men (Michelozzi 
et al., 1998). 
This study aimed at evaluating the morbidity and mortality 
effects of exposures to the three sources of air pollution (landﬁll, 
incinerator, and reﬁnery plant) in the cohort of people living in the 
Malagrotta area. Dispersion models were used for exposure as- 
sessment considering urban trafﬁc and individual factors (e.g. 
educational level, occupation, area-based socioeconomic status) as 
potentially confounding variables. 


The landﬁll, one of the largest in Europe (15 ha of surface, 
1.46 million t MSW/year), began ofﬁcially in 1984 receiving un- 
processed municipal waste; however, the unofﬁcial use of the 
landﬁll dates back at least 10–15 years. The closure of the landﬁll 
was announced in 2004 but actually occurred at the end of 2013, 
after Italy received a notice from the EU Commission for in- 
fringement of the Landﬁll Directive (1999/31/EC). The incinerator 
for medical waste (stack height 80 m, stack diameter 1.13 m, exit 
velocity 15.5 m/s, capacity 60 t/day) began its activity in 1996, 
replacing the old MSW incinerator that had burnt waste from 1964 
to 1985 and then closed because of failure to comply with pollu- 
tion standards as no emissions control measures were operating. 
The petrochemical reﬁnery (97 ha of surface, 15 stacks ranging 
from 25 to 72 m in height, stacks diameter ranging from 0.8 to 
2.9 m, exit velocity ranging from 1 to 5.9 m/s) has been reﬁning 
4.3 million t/year of crude oil since 1964 and is the most important 
reﬁnery plant in central Italy. 
The study area was deﬁned as a 7 km radius from the boundary 
of the landﬁll deﬁned using GIS software to allow a proper com- 
parison among subjects with a wide range of contrasting exposure 
values The petrochemical reﬁnery and the waste incinerator were 
located by their chimneys coordinates. The World Geodetic System 
of 1984, with the Universal Transverse Mercator zone 33Nord 
projection (WGS84_UTM33N) was the reference for the geo- 
graphical coordinates. 

We used a Lagrangian particle model (SPRAY ver.5) to simulate 
the concentration of air pollutants (ARIANET, 2014). The SPRAY 
model simulates the transport, dispersion and deposition of pol- 
lutants emitted (2005 emission inventories) using the orography, 
the meteorological data (managed by RAMS 2005 (RAMS, 2014)), 
the turbulence and the hourly spatial distribution (horizontal and 
vertical) of the emissions, based on the characteristics of the single 
source and on the mass ﬂuxes (g/h). The model follows the path of 
ﬁctitious particles in the atmospheric turbulent ﬂow, and it is able 
to take into account complex situations, such as the presence of 
obstacles, breeze cycles, strong meteorological non homogeneities 
and non-stationary, wind calm conditions. 
The domain for estimating pollutants concentrations was a 
square of 30 (cid:2) 30 km2 and the resolution chosen was 500 m 
(consistent with the meteorological ﬁelds). A single concentration 
value was estimated as the annual average for a square cell of 
500 m (cid:2) 500 m. For each source, a pollutant was selected as the 
exposure marker: hydrogen sulphide (H2S) for the landﬁll, sulphur 
oxides (SOX) for the petrochemical reﬁnery, and airborne parti- 
culate matter of diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) 
for the 
incinerator. 
The landﬁll emissions (H2S) were generated using Landﬁll Gas 
Emissions Model (Landﬁll Gas Emissions Model, 2014). Using the 
dates of starting and ending of the operation for each sector of the 
landﬁll, the waste capacity and the waste acceptance rate, the 
emission rates for H2S were calculated using a ﬁrst-order de- 
composition rate equation. The Emission Manager software EMMA 
was used to approximate the landﬁll shape as a regular grid with a 
resolution of 125 m (cid:2) 125 m and to estimate the hourly emissions 
of the H2S emission in each landﬁll allotment (Calori and Radice, 
2004). 
We obtained the hourly emission values of SOX (reﬁnery) and 
PM10 (incinerator) assuming uniform time modulation and using 
information about the chimney geographic coordinates, its inter- 
nal diameter, the percentage of release of gases, the temperature 
and speed of the ﬂue gas. Estimated annual average concentration 
maps of current H2S, SOX, and PM10 levels were produced. Al- 
though it can be assumed that signiﬁcant changes occurred in 
relation to the activity in the area and the speciﬁc emissions, i.e. 
increasing and decreasing of the landﬁll activity, change in the 
activity of the incinerator, emission control from the reﬁnery, no 
emission data from the past were available so to consider time- 
changes in the exposure variables in the analysis. Therefore, no 
attempt was made to back extrapolate concentration levels. 

The Rome Longitudinal Study (RoLS) (a population-based co- 
hort enrolled from the 2001 Italian census) was the source for the 
study cohort (Cesaroni et al., 2010). The RoLS is part of the National 
Statistical Program for the years 2011–2014 and was approved by 
the Italian Data Protection Authority. All residents, living in the 
study area at the same baseline address for at least 5 years before 
October 2001, and who did not move during the course of the 
follow-up, were enrolled. Vital status was assessed using the Rome 
municipal register during the period October 2001 to December 
2010. We considered subjects as lost to follow-up if they died or 
moved out of the city. Each subject in the cohort was assigned a 
value of H2S, SOX, and PM10 corresponding to the estimated map 
values at their residence. 

We analyzed natural and cause-speciﬁc mortality and hospital 
admissions. We considered cancer types for which there were 
some possible hypotheses of an association with environmental 
factors: stomach, colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, 
bladder, kidney, brain, and lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer 
(see appendix for ICD IX codes) (Porta et al., 2009; Bhopal et al., 
1998; Michelozzi et al., 1998; Ranzi et al., 2011; Rushton 2003; 
Elliott et al., 1996; Bhopal et al., 2009). The underlying cause of 
death for deceased subjects was retrieved from the regional Reg- 
istry of Causes of Death, while hospital admissions were obtained 
from the regional Hospital Information System. For each subject 
only the principal diagnoses cause of hospitalization were used 
and the event was deﬁned at the time of the ﬁrst hospitalization 
for a speciﬁc cause that occurred in the study period. 

We considered for each subject age, gender, region of birth 
(north, center, south, out of Italy) educational level (high: uni- 
versity, medium: high school and low: elementary school), 


occupation (non manual labor, manual labor, retired, unemployed, 
housewife), civil status (married, single, separated/divorced, wi- 
dowed), and an area-basedsocio-economic position (SEP) index 
(high, medium, low) (Cesaroni et al., 2006). 
Outdoor concentrations of NO2 (μg/m3) at the residential ad- 
dresses of the cohort participants were available from a Land Use 
Regression (LUR) model built for the city of Rome (Cesaroni et al., 
2012). We categorized the NO2 estimated concentration of μg/m3 
in three levels: low (NO2o ¼30), medium (30 oNO2o ¼40) and 
high (NO2440). We also considered NO2 (in μg/m3) related to the 
municipal solid waste transport system (diesel trucks) from the 
city of Rome to the landﬁll in 2008 (low: NO2o ¼ 0.101, medium: 
0.101 oNO2o ¼0.856, and high: NO240.856) (further details 
in http://www.integrated-assessment.eu/content/health_effects_ 
waste_management). 
As an alternative surrogate of long term exposure to air pol- 
lution at the baseline address, we used the Functional Road Class 
(FRC) attribute (included in the TeleAtlas MultiNet road network) 
to classify the type of street: motorway (FRC ¼0) and major trafﬁc 
roads (FRC ¼1–5). 

We investigated the correlation between exposure to H2S, SOX, 
and PM10 using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient. We used gender- 
speciﬁc Cox proportional hazard regression models [hazard ratios 
(HRs)] to study the association between air pollution exposures 
and the study outcomes, with age as the underlying time variable. 
To take into account possible time-related changes in mortality 
and hospitalization rates during the study period, the analyzes 
were performed stratifying by calendar period (2001–2004; 2005– 
2007; 2008–2010). 
Exposure to the different pollution sources was modeled (sin- 
gle-pollutant models) as a ﬁxed continuous variable using the 
value of the annual mean exposure at the residence. Because of the 
varying magnitude of the exposure indicator, the linear associa- 
tions were estimated for an increment equal to the difference 
between the 95th and the 5th percentiles of the distribution of 
each pollutant. HRs were estimated considering as confounders all 
the individual covariates, the GIS variables, and the other en- 
vironmental factors. More parsimonious models were built using a 
backward elimination strategy for variables with a p-value4 0.20 
(this was done for major outcomes like non-accidental mortality). 
The ﬁnal models included the following variables: education, oc- 
cupation, civil status, area-based SEP index, and the outdoor NO2 
concentration (from the LUR model). In order to disentangle the 
role of each pollutant/source of emission, single and multi- 
pollutant (bi-pollutant) models were performed. We considered as 
candidate for the multipollutant analyzes all the possible positive 
associations between the pollutants and the outcomes that had 
more stable effect estimates. 
The potential spatial autocorrelation of health outcomes was 
taken into account because people that are geographically close 
are more similar to each other than to people who live far away 
and therefore tend to experience more similar outcome rates. In 
order to adjust for this phenomenon, each address was classiﬁed 
according to a 500 m (cid:2) 500 m grid, and the Cox regression model 
was extended by including a random intercept of the grid cells. 
Although we always considered spatial autocorrelation in our 
analysis, the only condition where this correlation was statistically 
signiﬁcant was for non accidental mortality among men (p-value 
of the random intercepto 0.015). 
All tests were based on the likelihood ratio test statistic. Two- 
sided 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of 
the Wald test of the Cox regression parameter on the log ratio 
scale. STATA and R softwares were used for the statistical analyzes. 

Fig. 1 illustrates the study area (a) and results of the dispersion 
model for H2S originating from the landﬁll (b), SOX, from reﬁnery 
(c), and PM10 from the incinerator (d). The dispersion model for 
H2S shows the highest concentration of the pollutant on the 
landﬁll itself with a regular dispersion in the surrounding area. 
The dispersion of SOX originated from multiple point sources at 
the reﬁnery plant (with heights ranging from 25 m-responsible for 
a more local dispersion-to 72 m with wider dispersion) had overall 
a larger impact in the area. The dispersion of PM10 from the in- 
cinerator was mainly inﬂuenced by chimney height (80 m) and 
prevailing winds (SW-NE direction). The results were a relatively 
wide dispersion of particles in the area in two directions, one on 
the southwest and one on the northeast of the chimney. 
A total of 85,559 individuals were enrolled in the cohort in 
2001 (48.2% males), and the concentrations of the pollutants 
were estimated for each of them at their residential address at 
baseline. Online supplementary Fig. S1 shows the population 
distribution of exposure levels for H2S, SOX, and PM10. The annual 
average exposure levels of the population [mean (SD, 50th per- 
centile, 95th–5th percentiles )] were generally low: 0.02 μg/m3 
(0.03, 0.01, 0.04) for H2S (landﬁll), 1.67 μg/m3 (0.92, 1.52, 2.88) for 
SOX (petrochemical reﬁnery), and 0.02 ng/m3 (0.02, 0.02, 0.04) for 
PM10 (incinerator). The three exposure indicators were highly 
correlated: the correlation coefﬁcient between H2S and SOX was 
0.78, between H2S and PM10 was 0.75, and between SOX and PM10 
was 0.81. The cut-offs for the upper 90th percentile were 
0.03 ng/m3 for H2S, 2.52 μg/m3 for SOX, and 0.03 mg/m3 for PM10. 
(Table S1) 
In addition to the pollution produced by the industrial plants, 
air quality in the area was greatly affected by trafﬁc as it is located 
close to important roads: the Ring Road of Rome, two highways 
(one leading to the airport), and a local road network mainly de- 
voted to MSW transport to the landﬁll. Online supplementary Fig. 
S2 shows the location of the highways, the high trafﬁc roads, and 
estimated NO2 concentration levels from road trafﬁc, and from 
waste transport. 
The main characteristics of the 85,559 subjects according to 
three exposure sources (divided by 50th and 90th percentile cut- 
offs) are described in Table 1. 
The distribution of gender, age classes, birth place, and civil 
status was rather similar over the exposure categories for all pol- 
lutants. However, people living in areas with high concentrations 
of H2S, SOX, or PM10 were more likely to be less educated, to be 
manual workers, and of low SEP compared with their reference 
groups (po0.05). In addition, people in the high exposure cate- 
gories tended to live closer (500 m) to highways, but more distant 
from the high trafﬁc roads; therefore, trafﬁc-related NO2 con- 
centrations were lower in these groups compared with those in 
the low exposure category (po0.05). No differences between the 
cohort and the general population living in Rome was observed for 
gender, age, level of education, civil status, and occupation. The 
main difference between Roman citizens and residents in this area 
is that in this cohort 62% of people lived in low and medium-low 
SEP areas compared to 41.1% observed in Rome, in addition the 
mean NO2 level in Rome was 43.6 μg/m3 (SD 8.4) whereas the 
mean level in this area was lower, i.e. 37.8 μg/m3 (SD 5.02). 
During the study period (October 2001–December 2010) we 
observed 6187 deaths and, after excluding trauma, we considered 
5878 (3233 men and 2645 women) deaths from non accidental 
causes (38.8% from cancer, 38.1% from cardiovascular diseases, and 
6.5% from respiratory diseases); 45514 subjects were admitted to 
the hospital (13.2% for cancer, 25.2% for cardiovascular diseases, 
and 12.6% for respiratory diseases). 



We found an association between the linear term of H2S ex- 
posure and laryngeal cancer (HR ¼1.36; 95% CI 1.02–1.83, based on 
6 cases) as well as bladder cancer (HR ¼1.35; 95% CI 1.00–1.82) in 
women. Mortality for pancreatic and laryngeal cancer was asso- 
ciated with SOX from the reﬁnery, again only among women 
(HR¼ 1.75, 95% CI 1.02–3.01 and HR ¼ 4.99, 95% CI 1.64–15.2, re- 
spectively). A clear association between PM10 and pancreatic 
cancer was observed in both genders (HR ¼1.40; 95% CI 1.03–1.90 
men; HR ¼ 1.47; 95% CI 1.12–1.93 women). PM10 was also asso- 
ciated with laryngeal cancer among women (HR¼ 1.92; 95% CI 
1.16−3.19) (Table 2). 
Table 3 shows the results for hospital admissions. There was an 
association of H2S exposure and hospitalizations for laryngeal 
cancer (HR ¼1.36; 95% CI 1.08–1.72, based on 9 cases with a clear 
overlap with mortality) only among women, and for cardiovas- 
cular diseases in both genders (HR¼1.02; 95% CI 0.98–1.05 in men 
and HR ¼1.04; 95% CI 1.00–1.09 women). H2S exposure was also 
associated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases 
among men (HR¼ 1.02 95% CI 0.97–1.07). SOX from the reﬁnery 
was associated with hospital admissions for laryngeal cancer 
among women (HR¼4.19; 95% CI 1.36–12.9) and for respiratory 
diseases among men (HR ¼1.13; 95% CI 1.01–1.27). There was an 
association between the linear term of PM10 exposure and for 
pancreatic cancer hospitalizations (HR ¼1.35; 95% CI 1.01–1.81) 
among men. PM10 was also associated with hospitalizations for 
liver (HR ¼ 1.55; 95%1.02–2.35), laryngeal (HR ¼ 1.83; 95%1.09– 
3.06), and breast cancers (HR ¼ 1.13; 95%1.00–1.27) among wo- 
men. PM10 exposure was also associated with hospital admission 
for respiratory diseases among men (HR ¼1.05 95% CI 0.99–1.12). 
It should be noted that there were few inverse associations 
among women, namely for SOx and PM10 and hospitalizations for 
cancer of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue and for PM10 
and hospitalizations for genitourinary diseases. 
Since only some confounders were used in our main models 
(education, occupation, civil status, area-based SEP index, and 
outdoor NO2 concentrations from the LUR model), we repeated the 
analyzes considering all sets of confounding variables and the 
results were very similar. 
Supplemental Tables S2 and S3 report the results of the mul- 
tipollutant models. In interpreting these results the high correla- 
tion among the pollutants should be noted, making some of the 
effect estimates unstable. For pancreatic cancer mortality, the 
strongest and most stable associations were found for PM10 in 
both gender and the adjustment for SOX or H2S did not alter the 
main results. The limited number of laryngeal cancer cases pre- 
cluded meaningful multivariate analyzes, however the strong as- 
sociation for SOx in females remained after multiple adjustment. 
The association of H2S with bladder cancer in females was sensi- 
tive to the adjustment for the other variables. For hospitalizations, 
PM10 was associated with liver cancer but the conﬁdence intervals 
were wider after adjustment whereas only limited changes were 
seen for PM10 and pancreatic cancer in males or breast cancer in 
females. The associations of H2S with cardiovascular morbidity in 
both males and females, as well as the association of SOx with 
respiratory diseases hospitalization in males, were not changed 
In summary, PM10 (in- 
after adjustment for other pollutants. 
cinerator) was the strongest factor for pancreatic mortality and 
hospital admissions and for breast cancer morbidity; SOx (reﬁnery) 
was the strongest factor for laryngeal cancer mortality in women 
and for respiratory hospital admissions in males; H2S (landﬁll) was 
in both 
associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions 
genders. 



Overall and all cancer mortality were not associated with the 
exposure indicators. However, we found a positive association be- 
tween the emissions from the incinerator and pancreatic cancer 
mortality in both genders and, among women, an association with 
breast cancer morbidity. Emissions from the reﬁnery were asso- 
ciated with laryngeal cancer mortality in women and with re- 
spiratory hospital admissions in males; H2S from the landﬁll was 
associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both genders. 
Our results for cancers are difﬁcult to be interpreted in etiolo- 
gical terms and a review of previous knowledge is useful. Lar- 
yngeal cancer has risk factors such as cigarette smoking, occupa- 
tional exposure to certain substances (eg asbestos), and alcohol 
consumption. An association of contaminated sites with laryngeal 
cancer has already been observed in two studies conducted in the 
1990s, one conducted in the Malagrotta area (Michelozzi et al., 
1998; Elliott et al., 1992). Two recent studies found associations 
between living close to incinerators and laryngeal cancer while a 
Canadian study did not detect any association (Ranzi et al., 2011; 
Federico et al., 2010; Williams and Jalaludin 1998). It is to note that 
the excess laryngeal cancer that we found among women was 
based on few cases (six of the nine cases hospitalized for larynx 
cancer were also observed deaths). A large ecological study, car- 
ried out in the UK, analyzed the incidence of bladder cancer in 
populations living at various distances from a landﬁll site and did 
not detect any association (Jarup et al., 2002). However, bladder 
cancer has been associated with residence in a polluted city area in 
a case-control study of the general population in Spain (Castaño- 
Vinyals et al., 2008). Pancreatic cancer was the site in excess in

both men and women in our study. The etiologic factors of pan- 
creatic cancer include smoking and alcohol abuse and the litera- 
ture does not support a potential effect of environmental chemi- 
cals (Schottenfeld and Fraumeni, 2006). A Finnish study found a 
strong excess of pancreatic cancer among men living in a former 
dump area, but the authors concluded that the observed excess 
was more likely explained by clustering of males with diabetes and 
pancreatitis-related behavior (Pukkala and Pönkä, 2001). However, 
a report of cancer incidence among persons living near a waste 
landﬁll site in Montreal, Canada, found increased incidence of 
cancers of the liver, kidney, pancreas, and non-Hodgkin's lym- 
phomas (Goldberg et al., 1999). 
Among women residents in this area we also observed an in- 
crease in the risk of hospital admissions for breast cancer, parti- 
cularly for those exposed to high concentrations of PM10 (in- 
cinerator). These results conﬁrm those recently found among

women living near the incinerator in Coriano (North of Italy) and 
are in line with other results previously published (WHO 2007; 
Ranzi et al., 2011). 
The increased risk for cardio-respiratory diseases, observed 
particularly among residents exposed to emissions from the in- 
cinerator and the reﬁnery, can be considered a plausible effect of 
air pollution typical of industrial areas. There is a body of scientiﬁc 
evidence to substantiate the ﬁndings with regard to cardio-re- 
spiratory effects of air pollution (Forastiere et al., 2011; WHO 
2005; Brook et al., 2010). 
From the results of this study it is not easy to determine which 
speciﬁc agent emitted from the plants could have an etiological 
role in the excess risks found. PM10 and SOX have been already 
used as surrogate markers for exposure to a complex mixture of 
the pollutants produced by combustion processes: particles, gases, 
metals, and organic compounds (Ranzi et al., 2011; Smargiassi 
et al., 2009). Gases emitted from landﬁlls consist of methane and 
carbon dioxide, and other gases, such as hydrogen sulphide and a 
mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted at low 
concentrations that comprises approximately 0.5% of the total 
emissions. We chose H2S as the landﬁll tracer because MSW 
landﬁlls are potential sources of offensive odors that disturb 
nearby communities and this emission can be well characterized 
(Palmiotto et al., 2014; Sarkar et al., 2003). Overall, the estimated 
concentrations of PM10, SOX and H2S were low and highly corre- 
lated (correlation 0.75–0.81) which make it more difﬁcult to 
identify emissions (and consequently the plants) most responsible 
for the observed effects. 
The strength of this work is the cohort size (85,559 residents) 
and the longitudinal study design adopted: individuals were fol- 
lowed for over ten years, exposure was assessed with advanced 
modeling techniques, and individual SEP, urban and waste truck 
trafﬁc were also considered as potential confounders. We deﬁned 
the study population as people living up to 7 km away from the 
plants, based on previous studies and on the estimated proﬁle of 
the distribution of pollutants emitted (Elliott et al., 1992). This 
choice provided a good contrast of exposure conditions and in- 
creased the comparability of the population groups. 
Pollutant levels estimated at residence may not adequately 
represent exposure because people do not spend all their time at 
home, and we did not provide any information regarding daily or 
occupational activities. However, the excesses we detected in the 
areas with higher exposure levels were observed mainly among 
women, a more stable population then men, suggesting that 
misclassiﬁcation of exposure is less likely to have occurred. The 
inaccuracy of individual exposure would lead to non-differential 
misclassiﬁcation and would tend to mask the detected association, 
leading to results biased towards the null, but we cannot exclude a 
chance ﬁnding given the multiple testing we performed. 
We could not take into account individual risk factors such as 
cigarette smoking, alcohol use and physical activity, however 
those individual characteristics are strongly associated with SEP. It 
is therefore reasonable to assume that the adjustment we made in 
the statistical analysis for education, occupation, and area-based 
SEP also adjusted for those unmeasured individual variables. 
However, we found no excess risk of lung, stomach or colon and 
rectum cancers. We noticed few inverse associations (cancer of the 
lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue and genitourinary diseases) 
for which we do not have an explanation other than chance. 
We took into account the effect of exposure to vehicular trafﬁc 
using predicted NO2 levels; the dispersion model for NO2 showed 
no overlap between the areas of high NO2 and the areas of high 
PM10, SOX, or H2S concentrations. The associations observed in the 
present study, if causal, represent the effects of long-term ex- 
posures to a pollutant mixture even after statistical control for the 
background pollutant levels. Indeed, the SOX exposure estimates 
used in this study are likely correlated with other stack and/or 
fugitive reﬁnery emissions such as PM2.5 and volatile organic 
compounds. 
We studied a closed population and therefore, immigrants, and 
all children born after October 2001 were not included. For this 
reason, it was not possible to assess the health of children re- 
sidents. However, the analysis carried out on 2815 children pre- 
sent to October 2001 revealed no special increases in the risk of 
mortality or hospital admission related to the estimated con- 
centration of the pollutant tracers of the plants (data not shown). 
Monitoring campaigns conducted during the study period 
shows that SOX, PM10, and NO2 concentrations in the Malagrotta 
area were below the limits established by law, and the H2S mea- 
sured concentrations were also below the reference value of 
150 μg/m3 set by the WHO guidelines for air quality (WHO, 2005; 
ISPRA, 2011). In this study we used authorized emission values to 
simulate dispersion from the industrial plants, which over- 
estimated concentration values; nevertheless the shape of the 
fallout and the gradients of exposure were not sensitive to this 
choice. It should be noted that we considered only exposure to air 
pollution whereas soil contamination or food and water con- 
sumption could have importance but detailed data on these as- 
pects were lacking. 
In conclusion, the study suggests an association between air 
contamination and some cancers and cardio-respiratory diseases. 
Although there was a high correlation between pollutants esti- 
mates, some speciﬁc effects from the single sources emerged. 

This study was part of the large project on the health effects of 
waste treatment plants in the Lazio region (ERAS Lazio: Epide- 
miology, Waste, Environment and Health in the Lazio region – 
www.eraslazio.it), supported by the Lazio Waste General Directo- 
rate (DGR n929/08). There was no scientiﬁc role of the funder. 
We thank M. Becker for her help in editing the manuscript, 
M. Stafoggia for the STATA scripts for spatial correlation analyzes. 
We wish to thank Carlo A Perucci, former director of our depart- 
ment, for initiating the ERAS Lazio project and for his long- 
standing support to environmental epidemiology.
