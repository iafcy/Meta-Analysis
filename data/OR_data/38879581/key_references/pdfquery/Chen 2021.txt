BACKGROUND: The evidence linking ambient air pollution to bladder cancer is limited and mixed. 
METHODS: We assessed the associations of bladder cancer incidence with residential exposure to ﬁne particles (PM2.5), nitrogen 
dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), warm season ozone (O3) and eight PM2.5 elemental components (copper, iron, potassium, nickel, 
sulfur, silicon, vanadium, and zinc) in a pooled cohort (N = 302,493). Exposures were primarily assessed based on 2010 
measurements and back-extrapolated to the baseline years. We applied Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for individual- 
and area-level potential confounders. 
RESULTS: During an average of 18.2 years follow-up, 967 bladder cancer cases occurred. We observed a positive though statistically 
non-signiﬁcant association between PM2.5 and bladder cancer incidence. Hazard Ratios (HR) were 1.09 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 
0.93–1.27) per 5 µg/m3 for 2010 exposure and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.99–1.14) for baseline exposure. Effect estimates for NO2, BC and O3 
were close to unity. A positive association was observed with PM2.5 zinc (HR 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00–1.16 per 10 ng/m3). 
CONCLUSIONS: We found suggestive evidence of an association between long-term PM2.5 mass exposure and bladder cancer, 
strengthening the evidence from the few previous studies. The association with zinc in PM2.5 suggests the importance of industrial 
emissions.

INTRODUCTION 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classiﬁed 
outdoor air pollution and particulate matter (PM) from outdoor air 
pollution as carcinogenic to humans [1]. The classiﬁcation was 
largely based on associations of outdoor air pollution and lung 
cancer, whereas some evidence for urinary bladder cancer was 
also noted. Bladder cancer is one of the most common cancers 
and among the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. 
According to the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019, 
bladder cancer accounted for 2.2%, 2.3% and 1.8% of the global 
neoplasm incident cases, deaths and disability-adjusted life-years 
(DALYs), respectively [2]. 
Studies have associated air pollution and increased bladder 
cancer risks in occupational settings, where workers were exposed 
to high concentrations of, 
for example, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and diesel exhaust [3–6]. So far, few studies 
have investigated residential exposure to ambient air pollution in 
the general population in relation to bladder cancer, and the 
results are mixed. In the American Cancer Society (ACS) Cancer 
Prevention Study II (CPS-II) analyses, bladder cancer mortality was 
signiﬁcantly positively associated with residential exposure to 
particulate mater with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5), 
statistically non-signiﬁcant associations were 
whereas weak, 
fou`nd with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) or ozone (O3) exposure [7]. 
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) also reported a 
signiﬁcantly positive association between residential PM2.5 expo- 
sure and bladder cancer mortality [8]. However, no association 
was found for incident bladder cancer risks with residential 
exposure to PM2.5 or NO2 in the Spanish Bladder cancer study [9] 
and the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects 
(ESCAPE) study [10]. 
As outdoor air pollution is a mixture of pollutants originating 
from multiple sources, studies also attempted to identify the most 
responsible air pollution sources for the potential bladder cancer 
risks. A limited number of studies have evaluated markers of trafﬁc 
and industrial sources, with inconsistent ﬁndings. A statistically 
non-signiﬁcant positive association between bladder cancer 
incidence and nitrogen oxide (NOx), as a proxy for trafﬁc-related 
air pollution, was found in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health 
(DCH) cohort [11], as well as in a cohort of 9816 coronary 
intervention patients in Israel [12]. No clear evidence was found 
for an association between residence along main roads and 
bladder cancer incidence in Amsterdam, using trafﬁc intensity as a 
surrogate exposure [13]. In an earlier analysis within the Spanish 
Bladder cancer study, several surrogate indices of air pollution 
from industrial emissions were found to be positively associated 
with bladder cancer 
from a 
contaminated landﬁll site in Rome was associated with increased 
risk of bladder cancer mortality in females [15]. However, the 
association was sensitive to the adjustment for other pollutants. In 
ESCAPE, exposure to NOx, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) 
and several elemental components were assessed to represent 
different air pollution sources [10], but none was associated with 
bladder cancer incidence. 

To add to the limited evidence on the associations between 
ambient air pollution and bladder cancer incidence in general 
population, we conducted analyses in a large pooled cohort 
within the Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: A Study in Europe 
(ELAPSE) project [16]. ELAPSE builds on the ESCAPE collaboration 
by pooling data from selected cohorts and extending the follow- 
up period. 
In addition, we strengthened exposure assessment 
which allowed better coverage of included cohorts in ELAPSE. In 
the present study, we assessed the associations between bladder 
cancer incidence and long-term exposure to PM2.5, NO2, BC and 
O3. We further explored potential bladder cancer 
risks with 
speciﬁc elemental components in PM2.5, in an attempt to identify 
the most responsible air pollution sources. 
METHODS 
Study population 
Within the ELAPSE collaboration, we pooled data from eight cohorts across 
six European countries. Cohorts were selected if they contributed to 
analysis of low-level air pollution, were recruited relatively recently and 
were able to share data for pooling. Detailed information of each individual 
cohort was described previously [17, 18]. Of these eight cohorts, six 
contained information on bladder cancer 
incidence and the most 
important potential confounders. These six cohorts are: the Cardiovascular 
Effects of Air Pollution and Noise in Stockholm (CEANS) cohort in Sweden 
[19–22], the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort (DCH) in Denmark [23], the 
Danish Nurse Cohort (DNC) in Denmark [24], the European Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Netherlands (EPIC-NL) cohort in the 
Netherlands [25], the Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la 
Mutuelle Générale de l’Education Nationale (E3N) in France [26], and the 
Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Prevention Programme (VHM&PP) 
in 
Austria [27] (Table 1). Except for the DNC, all other subcohorts were part of 
ESCAPE. All included cohort studies were approved by the medical ethics 
committees in their respective countries. Each individual cohort prepared 
data according to a joint ELAPSE codebook and then transferred the data 
to Utrecht University. Data were pooled after careful checking and stored 
on a secure server. 
Exposure assessment 
We investigated exposure to PM2.5, NO2, BC, warm season O3 (hereafter 
referred to as O3) and eight a priori selected PM2.5 elemental components 
in the present study. The eight components were selected in the ESCAPE 
study to represent major pollution sources in Europe: copper (Cu), iron (Fe) 
representing non-tailpipe trafﬁc emissions; zinc (Zn) representing industrial 
representing long-range transport of 
emissions primarily; sulfur 
secondary inorganic aerosols; nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V) representing 
mixed oil burning/industry; silicon (Si) representing crustal material; and 
potassium (K) representing biomass burning [28, 29]. 

We assessed 2010 annual average air pollution exposures with Europe- 
wide hybrid LUR models [30, 31], which incorporated ground-based 
measurements, satellite-derived estimates, chemical 
transport model 
estimates, land-use, road and population density data. The modelling of 
PM2.5, NO2 and O3 exposures was based on the European Environmental 
Agency AirBase routine monitoring data [30], whereas the modelling of BC 
[30] and elemental composition exposures [31] was based on the 
standardised ESCAPE monitoring data. The hybrid LUR models were 
developed using supervised linear regression (SLR) and validated with ﬁve- 
fold hold-out validation. The models explained a moderate to large fraction 
of the measured concentration variation at the European scale (i.e. 66% for 
PM2.5, 58% for NO2, 51% for BC, 60% for O3 and 41% to 79% across 
elemental components). Exposure models for PM2.5 elemental composition 
were also developed with the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The RF 
models consistently outperformed the SLR models at the European scale, 
whereas the SLR and RF models explained within-area variability similarly 
[31]. In the present study, we primarily exploited within-cohort exposure 
contrasts and thus interpreted the SLR and RF models equally. The 
exposure models were applied to create 100 × 100 m grids of the predicted 
air pollution concentrations covering the entire study area. Exposure to air 
pollution was assigned to participants’ baseline residential addresses. We 
truncated negative elemental composition exposure predictions to zero, 
and a few unrealistically high exposure predictions to a maximum 
modelled concentration for each element [31]. Truncation was performed 
for SLR-modelled exposures (mostly to negative predictions): 12.9% for Cu, 
0.6% for Fe, 14.1% for Ni, 16.8% for V and 3.4% for Zn. No truncation was 
needed for RF-modelled exposures. 
We selected 2010 as the primary year of exposure modelling because 
2009–2010 was the period of ESCAPE monitoring, which we used to 
develop BC and PM2.5 composition models [30, 31]. For PM2.5, this was the 
earliest year of a sufﬁciently wide coverage of PM2.5 monitoring across 
Europe [30]. For consistency, we used year 2010 for NO2 and O3 as well. 
This analysis assumes that the spatial contrast of the relevant pollution 
concentrations remained reasonably stable from the baseline period (years 
1985–2005, Table 1) to 2010 [30]. 
For PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3, we also estimated exposures at each 
individual’s baseline year using back-extrapolation. Back-extrapolation was 
performed by using estimated concentrations from the Danish Eulerian 
Hemispheric Model (DEHM) [32]. DEHM modelled predictions of monthly 
average concentrations across Europe at 26 × 26 km spatial resolution back 



to at least 1990 were obtained. We compared temporal patterns of DEHM- 
modelled concentrations and ground-based measurements for countries 
with monitoring data [30]. To allow different spatial trends within Europe, 
we calculated population weighted average concentrations at 
the 
Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics (NUTS-1) spatial scale for 
application to the national cohorts. NUTS-1 reﬂects major socio-economic 
regions (e.g. four regions in the Netherlands and 14 regions in France). For 
smaller study areas, we calculated population weighted average concen- 
trations within the study area. We back-extrapolated concentrations using 
both a difference and a ratio method with 2010 as the baseline. With the 
difference method, the concentration difference between a year and 2010 
from the DEHM model is added to all cohort exposures for that year. With 
the ratio method, the concentration ratio between a year and 2010 from 
the DEHM model is used to multiply all cohort exposure for that year. We 
were not able to estimate exposures to PM2.5 elemental components at 
baseline years, because we had insufﬁcient information on the elemental 
composition concentration in Europe over time. 
Outcome 
For all cohorts, except E3N, cancer diagnosis data were obtained from 
national cancer registries. In E3N, cancer was identiﬁed by self-reports from 
biannual questionnaires, which were conﬁrmed through pathological 
reports and reviewed by an oncologist, or from death certiﬁcates. Bladder 
cancer incidence was deﬁned as the ﬁrst primary diagnosis during the 
follow-up, according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision (ICD-9) code 188 and the International Statistical Classiﬁcation of 
Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code C67. 
Participants with any cancer diagnoses (except non-melanoma skin cancer) 
before baseline were excluded. 

Statistical analyses 
Main analyses. We applied Cox proportional hazards models to estimate 
associations between long-term air pollution exposures and bladder 
cancer incidence, following the common ELAPSE analytical framework 
In the Cox models, we stratiﬁed by subcohorts because the 
[33, 34]. 
assumption of proportional hazards did not hold for subcohorts. Using 
strata to account for between-cohort heterogeneity implies that we mostly 
evaluate within-cohort exposure contrasts. Each air pollutant was included 
as a linear term in the Cox models. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were 
calculated with a ﬁxed increment 
following the 
selected in previous ESCAPE and ELAPSE publications 
increments 
[17, 18, 35]: PM2.5—5 µg/m3, NO2—10 µg/m3, BC—0.5 × 10−5/m, O3—10 
µg/m3, PM2.5 Cu—5 ng/m3, PM2.5 Fe—100 ng/m3, PM2.5 K—50 ng/m3, 
PM2.5 Ni—1 ng/m3, PM2.5 S—200 ng/m3, PM2.5 Si—100 ng/m3, PM2.5 V—2 
ng/m3, PM2.5 Zn—10 ng/m3. Censoring occurred at the time of any cancer 
other than bladder cancer diagnosis (except non-melanoma skin cancer), 
death, emigration, loss to follow-up or end of follow-up, whichever came 
ﬁrst. We speciﬁed three confounder models with increasing adjustment for 
individual- and area-level covariates: Model 1 included age (as the time 
axis), subcohort (as strata), sex (as strata), and year of enrollment (as a 
continuous variable); Model 2 further adjusted for 
individual-level 
including marital status (married/cohabiting, divorced/sepa- 
covariates, 
rated, single, widowed), smoking status (never, former, current), smoking 
duration (years of smoking) and smoking intensity (cigarettes/day) for 
current smokers, squared smoking intensity, body mass index (BMI) in 
categories (<18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, and ≥30 kg/m2), and employment 
status (employed vs. unemployed); Model 3 (main model) further adjusted 
for area-level mean income in 2001 (as a continuous variable). The spatial 
scale of area varied from smaller neighbourhoods and city districts (CEANS, 
EPIC-NL, E3N) to municipalities (DCH, DNC, VHM&PP). Participants with 
missing exposure or incomplete information on Model 3 covariates were 
excluded from all analyses to ensure comparability among the model 
results. 
Two-pollutant models were speciﬁed for all combinations of PM2.5, NO2, 
BC and O3 to assess the robustness of effect estimates for one pollutant to 
inclusion of another. Two-pollutant models for elemental composition 
were analysed with PM2.5 or NO2 as the second pollutant. We adjusted for 
PM2.5 to investigate whether the association with individual elemental 
components remained after adjustment for generic PM2.5 mass [36]; we 
adjusted for NO2 in an attempt to disentangle the individual component 
effect from trafﬁc exhaust emission for which NO2 is used as a marker. 
Additional analyses. Given the fact that cancer development is usually a 
long process, the choice of the exposure period may be critical and is often

discussed in air pollution and cancer research [37]. We therefore applied 
exposures back-extrapolated to baseline years as described above to 
assess the sensitivity of our ﬁndings to using the 2010 exposures. To assess 
the sensitivity of our ﬁndings to potential residual confounding, we further 
adjusted for smoking in former smokers, education level, occupational 
status and alcohol assumption in cohorts that had such information. To 
assess the impact of 
individual cohorts on the effect estimates, we 
assessed the effect estimates by excluding one cohort at a time. We also 
assessed the associations between the four main pollutants and bladder 
cancer 
the low 
incidence in individual cohorts, acknowledging that 
number of cases in most cohorts may result in imprecise effect estimates. 
To evaluate the potential bias introduced by excluding participants with 
missing information on Model 3 covariates, we ﬁtted Model 1 and Model 2 
with participants with complete information on model 1 and model 2 
covariates respectively. 
We assessed the shape of the concentration-response functions (CRFs) 
for air pollution exposure and bladder cancer incidence with natural cubic 
splines with three degrees of freedom. We performed subset analyses for 
PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3 exposures by restricting the main Model 3 analyses 
to participants with exposure level below certain cut-off values. 
We evaluated effect modiﬁcation by age at baseline (<65 vs. ≥65 years), 
sex and smoking status. For age categories and smoking status, we 
introduced an interaction term with air pollution into the model; for sex, 
we replaced the strata term by an interaction term with air pollution. We 
performed the Wald test to examine the differences in HRs between 
groups. 
For elemental composition, we performed analyses with exposures 
estimated with SLR and RF models and interpreted results of the two 
exposure methods equally. We presented most elemental composition 
analyses with the SLR-modelled exposures in the main text because PM2.5, 
NO2, BC and O3 exposures assigned to the cohorts were only estimated 
with SLR models [30]. In a subsequent analysis, we documented that, for 
PM2.5 and NO2 separately, SLR and RF models performed similarly, and had 
highly correlated predictions at randomly selected external validation sites 
(PM2.5: Pearson r = 0.89; NO2: r = 0.93) [38]. The SLR models are further 
more comparable to the LUR models used in the ESCAPE study [10]. 
All analyses were performed in R version 3.4.0 using packages: survival, 
coxme, Matrix, foreach, glmnet, multcomp, survey, splines, Hmisc, mfp, VIM, 
ggplot2, frailtySurv, survsim, eha, stamod, metafor. Statistical signiﬁcance 
was based on a 95% conﬁdence interval of effect estimate not 
including unity. 
RESULTS 
After excluding 17.7% of the total population, the pooled study 
consisted of 302,493 individuals, of whom 967 developed bladder 
cancers during 5,505,372 person-years of follow-up (Table 1). The 
exclusions were due to fail in logical checks (e.g. date of death 
before date of cancer diagnosis; 0.9%), cancer diagnosis before 
baseline (2.9%), missing exposure (0.5%), missing individual-level 
covariates (12.5%) or area-level mean income (0.9%). Most of the 
cohorts started in the 1990s and had follow-up untill 2011–2015. 
The largest subcohort was VHM&PP, which contributed more than 
half of the total person-years. Mean age of the participants at 
baseline ranged from 41.7 years to 72.5 years. Four subcohorts 
included female participants only and the pooled cohort 
comprised 66% women. Current smoker prevalence at baseline 
ranged from 13% to 37% with mean smoking duration ranging 
from 13.4 years to 43.2 years across subcohorts. 
Figure 1 and Table S1 show the SLR-modelled air pollution 
exposure distribution in each subcohort. The exposure concentra- 
tions were generally lower in the North European cohorts than in 
more Southern cohorts. The within-cohort exposure contrast was 
substantial for NO2, BC, Cu, Fe, Si and more limited for PM2.5, O3, K, 
Ni, S, V and Zn. Exposure distribution for elemental composition 
estimated with RF models is presented in Figure S1. We observed 
similar north-south concentration gradient 
for RF-modelled 
exposures. For most elements, 
the within-cohort exposure 
contrasts were smaller for RF- than SLR-modelled exposures. For 
PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3, exposures back-extrapolated to baseline 
years are shown in Fig. S2. The baseline PM2.5 exposures were 
higher and more variable than the 2010-exposure, whereas the 
baseline exposures to NO2, BC and O3 were similar or mildly 
higher than the 2010-exposure.

between BC and NO2 (Table S2). 



subcohorts, exposure to PM2.5 was moderately 
correlated with exposure to BC and NO2 
(Table S2). The 
correlations between NO2 and BC were high in most subcohorts. 
O3 exposures were negatively correlated with PM2.5, NO2 or BC. 
Correlations of elemental composition with PM2.5 were mostly low 
to moderate (Table S3). Correlations with NO2 were mostly high 
for Cu and Fe in subcohorts (Table S4). Correlations between air 
pollutants differed substantially in magnitude across cohorts, 
reﬂecting differences in study area size and presence of major 
sources. We focused on within-cohort correlations as 
the 
epidemiological analysis exploited mostly within-cohort exposure 
contrasts. 
Associations between air pollution and bladder cancer 
In the linear models, air pollution effect estimates were generally 
higher in the minimally adjusted models (Model 1, Table S5). HRs 
were mildly attenuated after adjusting for 
individual-level 
covariates (Model 2), and remained stable with further adjustment 
income (Model 3). The effect estimates were 
for area-level 
generally similar 
in Model 1 and Model 2, comparing the 
population with complete information on the corresponding 
model covariates and the population with complete data on 
Model 3 covariates, respectively, suggesting little selection bias 
was introduced by excluding participants with missing covariates 
(Table S5). In the fully adjusted models, we observed a positive but 
statistically nonsigniﬁcant association between PM2.5 exposure 
and bladder cancer 
incidence (Table 2). The HRs for PM2.5 
remained stable in two-pollutant models with adjustment for 
NO2, BC or O3, with wider CIs. No association was evident for NO2, 
BC or O3. For elemental composition estimated with SLR models, 
we observed positive associations for K, S, Si and Zn, which was 
only statistically signiﬁcant for Zn (Table 3). The HRs for K and Zn 
remained stable in two-pollutant models after adjusting for PM2.5 
or NO2, with slightly wider CIs. The HRs for S and Si attenuated to 
unity after adjustment 
for PM2.5. For RF-modelled elemental 
composition, we observed similar patterns for HRs for K, S, Si and 
Zn, except that HR for Si remained stable after adjusting for PM2.5 
(Table S6). Effect estimates were larger for elemental exposures 
estimated with RF models compared to SLR models, probably 
because of 
the generally smaller exposure contrasts for RF 
In two-pollutant models with adjustment for ele- 
predictions. 
mental composition, HRs for PM2.5 remained stable after adjusting 
for S or Si, whereas the HRs attenuated after adjusting for K and Zn 
(Table S7). HRs for PM2.5 in two-pollutant models with Zn were 
close to unity. 
The sensitivity analyses did not alter the main ﬁndings. HRs for 
PM2.5 back-extrapolated to baseline years attenuated mildly with 
narrower CIs compared to 2010 exposures (Table 4). The increased 
precision in HR was especially evident for back-extrapolated 
exposure using ratio method, as the exposure contrasts increased.

Exposures were estimated with supervised linear 
regression; effect 
estimates for elemental composition exposures estimated with random 
forest are shown in Table S6; effect estimates for PM2.5 and NO2 in two- 
pollutant models are shown in Table S7. 









For NO2, BC and O3, effect estimates with baseline exposure were 
essentially unity. The effect estimates were stable with additional 
adjustment for smoking intensity and duration in former smokers, 
education, occupational status and alcohol assumption in cohorts 
that had such information (Table S8). The effect estimates were 
generally stable in analyses where we excluded one cohort at a 
time (Fig. S3). The 95% CIs widen after excluding the large 
VHM&PP cohort, which contributed more than half of the person- 
years. For some pollutants, the HR point estimates increased or 
decreased when dropping the VHM&PP with the 95% CIs 
including unity. The uncertainty of HRs in most individual cohorts 
is large because of the small number of cases (Fig. S4). 
We generally observed a linear increase in the exposure- 
response function in the lower end of the exposure distribution 
(Fig. S5). For some pollutants, the CRFs showed a decreasing trend 
with wide CIs at the end of the curve, where observations were 
few and shapes, therefore, were difﬁcult to interpret. A positive 
association was found at low levels of NO2, decreasing at levels 
where the density of data was still sizable, which was difﬁcult to 
interpret. Subset analyses showed increased risks for bladder 
cancer incidence when restricting to PM2.5 concentrations below

15 μg/m3 exposures with wider CIs as the cancer cases became 
fewer (Table S9). For NO2, positive associations were found when 
excluding the highest NO2 exposures, consistent with the CRF. 
There was no clear evidence for effect modiﬁcation by age group 
or smoking status. Effect estimates tended to be higher 
in 
participants with baseline age < 65 y and current smokers, but the 
differences were not statistically signiﬁcant (Table S10). HRs for 
PM2.5 were signiﬁcantly higher for male than female, which could 
be due to residual confounding by smoking. 
DISCUSSIONS 
We observed a positive though statistically non-signiﬁcant 
association between long-term PM2.5 exposure and bladder 
cancer incidence in a pooled cohort of more than 300,000 
participants across Europe. 
In particular, zinc in PM2.5 was 
statistically positively associated with bladder cancer incidence. 
The associations were robust to adjustment for other pollutants 
and several sensitivity analyses. 
Two previous cohort studies reported signiﬁcantly positive 
associations between PM2.5 exposure and bladder cancer mortal- 
ity in the United States. Translating to a 5 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5 
(the exposure contrast used in our analyses), HRs of 1.15 (95% CI: 
1.04–1.27) and 1.22 (95% CI: 1.00–1.48) were reported in the ACS 
CPS-II and the NHIS studies [7, 8]. We observed a lower HR (1.09, 
95% CI: 0.93–1.27) for incident bladder cancer in the present study 
compared to the US studies. The HRs for bladder cancer mortality 
and incidence may not be directly comparable because cancer 
mortality reﬂects both disease incidence and survival following 
diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate for people diagnosed with 
bladder cancer is relatively high (i.e. average of 77% for bladder 
cancer cases diagnosed during 2010 through 2016 in the U.S.) [39]. 
In a Hong Kong study where mortality from both kidney and 
bladder cancers were evaluated together, a null association (HR: 
0.98, 95% CI: 0.58–1.64 per 10 µg/m3 of PM2.5) was reported [40]. 
The Spanish Bladder Cancer Study reported an OR of 1.06 (95% CI: 
0.71–1.60) for the association between bladder cancer incidence 
and a 5.9 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5, using a case-control study 
design [9]. In the ESCAPE study, a negative association with PM2.5 
was reported with a wide CI (HR per 5 µg/m3 = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.63, 
1.18) [10]. We did not attach too much importance to the negative 
point estimate given the wide CI. Built on the ESCAPE cohorts, the 
present study observed a narrower CI for PM2.5 effect estimate, 
which may relate to the longer follow-up and the conduct of a 
pooled analysis. The differences in effect estimates reported in 
ESCAPE and ELAPSE could also be explained by the somewhat 
different cohorts included. However, 
low heterogeneity across 
cohorts was observed in ESCAPE [10] and our results remained 
stable in sensitivity analysis when dropping one cohort at a time. 
All of the above mentioned studies adjusted for tobacco smoking 
in the statistical analyses, as smoking is the primary risk factor for 
bladder cancer 
[41]. There was no clear evidence of effect 
modiﬁcation by smoking status in the Spanish Bladder Cancer 
Study [9] and the ACS CPS-II [7], whereas the NHIS reported 
signiﬁcantly higher bladder cancer risks associated with PM2.5 
among current smokers [8]. We observed a stronger though 
statistically non-signiﬁcant association with PM2.5 among current 
smokers compared to never smokers, suggesting there might be 
some residual confounding by smoking even after adjustment for 
smoking status, duration and intensity in the present study. The 
small difference in HRs between models adjusted for smoking and 
other lifestyle factors with age-sex adjusted models, suggests 
confounding by smoking was likely limited. 
Ambient air pollution may promote bladder cancer through 
generic mechanisms such as inﬂammation and oxidative stress [1]. 
Besides that, air pollution also contains PAHs, dioxins and sulfur- 
containing compounds, which are known mutagens and/or 
carcinogens and could cause bladder cancers [42, 43]. Studies 
have linked occupational exposure to PAHs with higher risks of 
bladder cancers [5]. Higher bladder cancer risks have also been 
related to occupational exposure to high concentrations of diesel- 
engine exhaust [4, 44]. The IARC concluded ‘sufﬁcient evidence’ 
for the carcinogenicity of diesel-engine exhaust in humans [45]. 
Diesel engines are used for on-road and non-road transport and 
(heavy) equipment in various industrial sectors. Over the past 
decades, diesel-engine exhaust 
from on-road vehicles has 
decreased substantially in North America and Europe because of 
the adoption of tight emission standards. However, emissions 
from non-road applications (e.g. 
largely 
uncontrolled. In Western Europe, increased risks of bladder cancer 
were found for metal workers and machinists [5]. Associations in 
general populations are less clear. 

In the present study, we found no evidence of associations 
between trafﬁc-related air pollution and bladder cancer incidence, 
reﬂected by effect estimates close to unity for proxies of tailpipe 
emission (BC and NO2) and non-tailpipe emission such as brake, 
tyre and road abrasions (Cu and Fe in PM2.5). We also did not ﬁnd 
evidence that trafﬁc-related air pollution was associated with lung 
cancer in the same study [18, 34]. Analyses in the Spanish Bladder 
cancer study, the ACS CPS-II and the ESCAPE also showed no 
associations between NO2 exposure and bladder cancer risks 
[7, 9, 10]. The ESCAPE further documented null associations with 
bladder cancer incidence for NOx, BC, trafﬁc density, and Cu and 
Fe in PM [10]. In an earlier study conducted in Amsterdam, no 
evidence for an association between residential trafﬁc density and 
bladder cancer incidence was found [13]. In the DCH cohort, which 
is a subcohort included in the current pooled analysis, a 100 ug/ 
m3 increase in NOx was associated with an HR of 1.32 (95% CI: 
0.80, 2.19) for bladder cancer incidence [11]. Analyses in an Israeli 
cohort of 9816 coronary intervention patients reported a similar 
magnitude of effect estimate with a much wider CI for bladder 
cancer incidence: an HR of 1.07 (0.83, 1.37) per 10-ppb increase in 
NOx, translating to an HR of 1.40 (0.39, 4.83) per 100 μg/m3 
increase in NOx [12]. We found positive associations between NO2 
and bladder cancer 
low concentrations, 
incidence only at 
decreasing at high NO2 concentrations. The non-linear CRF was 
difﬁcult to interpret and could be related to competing risks for 
other diseases that were not accounted for in the present study. 









We found robust associations between bladder cancer inci- 
dence and Zn exposure in the present study. Zn was primarily 
related to industrial emissions in our exposure models, reﬂected 
by the large proportion of variation in measurements explained by 
predictors representing industrial Zn emission [31]. The observed 
associations could be due to Zn exposures per se, or other 
correlated components from industrial emissions. We did not 
observe consistently positive associations between bladder cancer 
incidence and exposure to Ni or V in the present study, which 
were selected to represent emission from mixed oil burning/ 
industry [28, 29]. Both Ni and V are suggested to derived mainly 
from shipping emission in Europe [46], whereas Zn was 
considered as a source identiﬁer for metals industry [47]. This is 
supported by ports from land-use being important predictors for 
our Ni and V models [31]. The correlations between Zn and Ni as 
well as Zn and V exposures were low to moderate in the present 
study (average of cohort-speciﬁc Spearman correlation coefﬁ- 
cients ranged from 0.19 to 0.75)[17]. The earlier Spanish Bladder 
Cancer Study reported positive associations with bladder cancer 
for several indices of air pollution from industrial emissions [14]. 
The limitation of using exposure indices, such as proximity to 
industries, 
is that the air pollution concentrations cannot be 
quantitatively estimated. In an analysis within population residing 
in proximity of a coal-oil-ﬁred thermal power plant in Italy, an 
increased risk of bladder cancer was related to higher exposure to 
benzene and NO2 in women aged ≥75 y [48]. 
The main strength of this study is that we were able to pool 
data from six European cohorts with detailed individual- and area- 
level covariate information, 
including smoking. The pooling of 
data allowed for high statistical power to examine the association 
between air pollution exposure and the incidence of a rare cancer. 
Another strength is the application of centrally developed Europe- 
wide air pollution exposure models. Applying consistent exposure 
estimates for such a large international study facilitates the correct 
interpretation of results. Compared to ESCAPE, the Europe-wide 
exposure models were improved by additionally incorporating 
outputs from chemical 
transport models and satellite data 
representing the regional background concentrations for emis- 
sions from speciﬁc sources [30, 31, 49]. Thus the model speciﬁcity 
was increased, which helped to identify the health effects 
associated with speciﬁc air pollutants. 






the exposure assessments were 
based on 2010 measurements whereas most included subcohorts 
started in the mid-1990s. We assumed that the spatial contrast 
of air pollution remained stable over the past decades, which was 
conﬁrmed by several 
[50–52], 
suggesting little bias was introduced. Importantly, we observed 
robust associations when applying back-extrapolated exposures 
for PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3. Unfortunately, we were not able to 
assess associations with back-extrapolated exposures for PM2.5 
elemental components because of the insufﬁcient information of 
trends over 
the possibility that 
spatial contrast for these air pollutants may have been less 
stable. Moreover, the generally moderate performance of the 
elemental models may limit our ability to detect a potential 
association. As 
introduced are 
likely nondifferential, the effect estimates are more likely to be 
biased toward null. Another limitation is that we were unable to 
account for residential mobility during follow-up and only have 
information on lifestyle factors at baseline, whereas the study 
population may move or change their smoking and other habits 
over time. We further cannot rule out the possibility of residual 
interest, 
confounding by other missing covariates of potential 
such as occupational exposures. We, however, observed robust 
adjustment 
results 
for occupational status or educational 
in subsets of the 
pooled cohort. 








CONCLUSIONS 
This study showed suggestive evidence of an association between 
long-term exposure to PM2.5 and bladder cancer 
incidence, 
strengthening the evidence from the few previous studies on 
PM2.5. We also found associations with zinc in PM2.5, which is 
primarily associated with industrial emissions. We found no 
association between trafﬁc-related air pollution and bladder 
cancer.
