ABSTRACT 
 
Although outdoor air pollution and particulate matter in outdoor air have been 
consistently linked with increased lung cancer risk, the evidence for associations at 
other cancer sites is limited.  Bladder cancer shares several risk factors with lung cancer 
and some positive associations of ambient air pollution and bladder cancer risk have 
been observed.  This study examined associations of ambient air pollution and bladder 
cancer risk in the large-scale Spanish Bladder Cancer Study.  Estimates of ambient fine 
particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations were assigned to 
the geocoded participant residence of 938 incident bladder cancer cases and 973 
hospital controls based on European multi-city land-use regression models.  Adjusted 
odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of ambient air 
pollution and bladder cancer risk were estimated using unconditional logistic regression 
models.  Overall, there was no clear association between either ambient PM2.5 (OR per 
5.9 µg/m3 = 1.06, 95% CI 0.71-1.60) or NO2 (OR per 14.2 µg/m3 = 0.97, 95% CI 0.84-
1.13) concentrations and incident bladder cancer risk.  There was no clear evidence for 
effect modification according to age group, sex, region, education, cigarette smoking 
status, or pack-years.  Results were also similar among more residentially stable 
participants and in two-pollutant models.  Overall, there was no clear evidence for 
associations of ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations and incident bladder cancer risk.  
Further research in other large-scale population studies is needed with detailed 
information on measured or modeled estimates of ambient air pollution concentrations 
and individual level risk factors.

INTRODUCTION 
 
In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified outdoor air 
pollution and particulate matter in outdoor air pollution as a Group 1 human 
carcinogen.1  Although there was sufficient evidence in human studies for lung cancer, 
evidence for other cancer sites is limited.  Bladder cancer shares several risk factors 
with lung cancer.  Some positive associations in studies using different metrics of 
exposure to outdoor air pollution, traffic, or traffic fumes and urinary bladder cancer 
risk were observed.   
 
Among workers’ studies, positive associations of occupation as a taxi driver, truck 
driver, or holding another job with assumed higher levels of exposure to outdoor air 
pollution (i.e. urban police officers, street vendors) and bladder cancer risk were 
reported.1  There were also positive associations with occupational exposure to diesel or 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons specifically.2-6 
 
Among general population studies, the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study reported a 
significant positive association of living > 40 years in a city of > 100,000 inhabitants 
and bladder cancer risk (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-
1.63), but no association with having windows facing a street with traffic, number of 
traffic lanes, traffic intensity, or living in proximity to industry.7  Other studies with 
either measured or modeled estimates of ambient air pollution concentrations have also

reported positive associations with bladder cancer, though there are limitations in some 
studies including a lack of data on cigarette smoking history, small numbers of observed 
cases, or the use of fatal rather than incident disease.8-10  In contrast, a recent analysis of 
the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects project (ESCAPE) reported no 
evidence for an association.11 
 
This study seeks to further examine the association between ambient air pollution and 
bladder cancer risk updating previous work based on city size and proximity to traffic in 
the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study by assigning estimates of ambient air pollution 
concentrations from a European land-use regression model developed as part of the 
ESCAPE project to the residential address of study participants.  The Spanish Bladder 
Cancer Study is a large case-control study including data on 1,219 incident bladder 
cancer cases and 1,271 hospital controls. 
 
MATERIALS & METHODS 
 
Study Population 
 
The Spanish Bladder Cancer Study was conducted from 1998-2001 and recruited 
participants from 18 hospitals in five regions (Alicante, Asturias, Barcelona, Tenerife, 
Valles/Bages).7  Incident cases were histologically-confirmed, aged between 21-80 
years.  Completeness of case ascertainment was verified through regular verification of

hospital registries, clinical records and pathology lists.  Controls were patients admitted 
to the hospital for conditions unrelated to the exposures under study including hernia 
(37%), fracture (23%), hydrocele (12%), and other abdominal surgery (11%) and were 
individually-matched to cases by hospital, 5-year age at diagnosis/interview, sex, 
ethnicity, and region of residence.  Other orthopedic, circulatory (varicose veins, 
hemorrhoids), dermatological, and ophthalmologic conditions represented the remainder 
of control diagnoses.  The response rates were 84% for cases and 88% for controls.   
 
Study participants completed an in-person computer-assisted interview in the hospital 
that captured data on a range of sociodemographic, lifestyle, occupational, personal and 
family characteristics, as well as lifetime residential history and several self-reported 
surrogate measures of ambient air pollution exposure for each residence held for more 
than one year including proximity to industry (i.e. presence of an industry within 1 km 
of the residence) and windows facing a street with traffic (including number of traffic 
lanes and traffic intensity).  A total of 20% of participants completed an abbreviated 
version of the study interview that did not capture the self-reported surrogate measures 
of ambient air pollution (above).  City size (for the year 2000) was obtained from the 
National Institute of Statistics, Spain.  Ethics approval was obtained from all 
participating institutions.  Written informed consent was obtained from all participants 
prior to interview. 
 
Ambient Air Pollution Concentrations 
This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

 
Estimated annual average ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide 
(NO2) concentrations from European multi-city land-use regression models developed 
as part of the ESCAPE study were used here.  Briefly, the ESCAPE study sought to 
examine the long-term health effects of air pollution exposure in cohort studies in 36 
areas of Europe using a common approach.12  Ambient air pollution concentrations were 
estimated using standardized methods for measurements, GIS variable collection, and 
land-use regression model development in individual study areas.13,14  Land-use 
regression models are based on a combining of data across 17 ESCAPE study areas for 
PM2.5 and 23 for NO2 (including Barcelona) across 14 countries.15  Monitoring data 
were collected at the street, urban background, and regional background locations from 
October 2008-May 2011 in three 2-week sampling periods in different seasons (warm, 
cold, intermediate) at 356 sites for PM2.5 and 960 sites for NO2. Annual average 
concentrations were estimated taking into account temporal trends from continuous 
reference monitors.  Following a supervised stepwise regression procedure, the final 
PM2.5 land-use regression model included regional background concentration, traffic 
load between 50 m and 1,000 m, traffic load in 50 m, and road length in 100 m (overall 
model R2 = 0.86).  For NO2, the final model included regional background 
concentration, traffic load in 50 m, road length in 1,000 m, natural and green in 5,000 
m, and traffic intensity on the nearest road (overall model R2 = 0.56).  Models had good 
prediction ability for transferability to independent study areas excluded from model 
building (median R2 = 0.42 for PM2.5 and 0.59 for NO2) supporting their application to

other European areas with common predictors and geographies.  Annual average air 
pollutant concentrations were linked to the geocoded participant residence address at 
enrollment. 
 
Statistical Analysis 
 
Associations of either ambient PM2.5 or NO2 concentrations and incident bladder cancer 
risk were estimated using unconditional logistic regression models adjusting for 5-year 
age group, sex, region, pack-years of cigarette smoking, and previously holding any 
high risk occupation (metal workers, hairdressers and barbers, painters, and chemical, 
leather, transport, and rubber industry workers) in both single and two-pollutant 
models.7  Sensitivity analysis adjusting for: exposure to disinfection by-products in 
drinking water (mean trihalomethane levels), fruit and vegetable consumption, 
education, passive smoking, income, marital status, and body mass index resulted in 
virtually no change in findings (<10% change in regression coefficients) (not presented 
here).  Potential effect modification by age group, sex, region, education, cigarette 
smoking status and pack-years of smoking was examined on the multiplicative scale 
with two-sided p values assessed according to the likelihood ratio statistic.  Finally, 
additional sensitivity analyses according to tumour histology, interview quality, 
previous cancer history, and number of years lived in the current residence was also 
performed.  Statistical analysis was conducted using R version 3.3.16

A total of 938 incident bladder cancer cases and 973 controls were retained for analysis 
following exclusions due to unreliable geocoding (n = 278 cases and 297 controls) or 
for the small number of non-white participants recruited (n= 3 cases and 1 control).  
Table 1 presents the distribution of selected participant characteristics.  Cases had a 
mean (SD) age of 65.8 (9.7) years and controls 64.7 (9.8) years.  The majority were 
male (88% cases, 87% controls).  The largest study regions were Asturias and 
Barcelona.  Cases reported smoking for a greater number of pack-years and more often 
ever holding a high risk occupation.   
 
PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 7.0 to 25.6 µg/m3 with a mean (SD) of 15.8 µg/m3 
(3.89) (Supplemental Table 1).  NO2 concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 58.6 µg/m3 with 
a mean (SD) of 28.6 µg/m3 (10.2).  The correlation between the two pollutants was r = 
0.64.  Participants from Barcelona had the highest concentrations of both PM2.5 and NO2 
followed by Elche and Valles (Table 2).  Men with the largest number of smoking pack-
years tended to have somewhat higher ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations compared 
with never smokers whereas the opposite was observed for women. 
 
Overall, there was no clear association of either ambient PM2.5 or NO2 concentrations 
and bladder cancer risk and there was no evidence for a trend (Table 3).  The OR (95% 
CI) in the highest (vs lowest) tertile of PM2.5 concentrations (>18.6 µg/m3) was 1.00 
(95% CI 0.64-1.56) and per each 5.9 µg/m3 (IQR) was 1.06 (95% CI 0.71-1.60).  For

NO2 the OR (95% CI) in the highest (vs lowest) tertile (>34.3 µg/m3) was 1.04 (95% CI 
0.80-1.34) and per each 14.2 µg/m3 was 0.97 (95% CI 0.84-1.13).  Results were also 
similar in a two-pollutant model.  There were some elevated ORs for both PM2.5 and 
NO2 among both female participants and never smokers, though results are based on 
small numbers (interaction p-values > 0.05) (Supplemental Table 2).  There was also no 
clear evidence for effect modification according to age group, region, education, or 
pack-years of smoking (not shown) (interaction p-values > 0.05).   
 
There was no association of either ambient PM2.5 or NO2 concentrations and bladder 
cancer risk upon analysis of participants with either a reliable or high quality interview 
as determined by the interviewer (92% of cases and 90% of controls), upon exclusion of 
participants with a previous or unknown history of cancer (6% of cases and 7% of 
controls), or those living for atleast 5 years in the current residence (86% of both cases 
and controls) (not shown).  There was also no clear association of ambient PM2.5 or NO2 
and urothelial carcinoma only.   
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Our analysis indicated no clear association between ambient PM2.5 and NO2 
concentrations and bladder cancer risk.  In contrast, a previous analysis in the same 
study population based on surrogate indicators of ambient air pollution reported a 
significant positive association of living > 40 years in a city of > 100,000 inhabitants,

but no association with windows facing a street with traffic, number of lanes, traffic 
intensity, or living in proximity to industry.7  The correlation between estimated 
ambient air pollution concentrations and city size here was moderate (rʼs = 0.39 and 
0.41 for PM2.5 and NO2, respectively). 
 
In contrast, positive associations have been reported in several other studies, including 
in a death certificate–based case-control study in Taiwan, with significant positive 
associations of particles of 10 μm or less in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), NO2, and 
sulfur dioxide (SO2) observed, but not with carbon monoxide (CO) or ozone (O3) (n = 
680 cases and 680 controls).8  An analysis of the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort 
reported a positive though non-significant association of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 
bladder cancer risk (n = 221).9  There was a significant positive association of ambient 
PM2.5 concentrations, but not NO2 or O3, and bladder cancer mortality in an analysis of 
the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-II) (hazard ratio (HR) 
per 4.4 µg/m3 = 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.23), n = 1,324 bladder cancer deaths).10  In 
contrast, in ESCAPE, no association of various modeled estimates of ambient air 
pollution concentrations, including ambient PM2.5 and NO2, and incident bladder cancer 
risk (n = 943) was observed.11  There was also no association of residential PM2.5 
concentrations and mortality due to malignant neoplasms of the urinary tract (n = 155) 
in a cohort of elderly Hong Kong residents.17

Strengths of the study include the assignment of ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations 
based on European multi-city land-use regression models specifically developed and 
validated for transferability to other geographical areas,15 addressing a major limitation 
of previous work based on surrogate self-reported indicators of ambient air pollution 
with high likelihood of misclassification.7  Though land-use regression models 
predicted variability in areas excluded from model building reasonably well (median 
R2ʼs ranging from 0.42-0.59), there are also other more locally developed models in 
Barcelona, Catalunya, and Asturias, with model R2ʼs ranging from 62-83% for PM2.5 
(Barcelona and Catalunya) and 71-75% for NO2.13,14  However, results based on local 
models here were similar and based on smaller numbers of study participants 
(Supplemental Table 1 and 3).  The correlation between concentrations assigned using 
the European or local models was strong for NO2 (r = 0.79) but weaker for PM2.5 (r = 
0.28).  We were unable to examine PM2.5 absorbance here (an indicator of diesel 
exhaust) based on the European models, as it required a regional value in the study area 
which could not be obtained, though results for PM2.5 absorbance based on local models 
also showed no evidence for an association.   
 
This work was also based on a large number (n=938) of included incident bladder 
cancer cases overall as well as detailed data on potentially confounding or modifying 
factors.  Although some previous studies noted stronger air pollution-lung cancer 
associations in either never or former smokers,18-20 there was no clear evidence for 
effect modification by cigarette smoking status here, though there was a tendency for

ORs to be somewhat larger among never smokers as well as among men with fewer 
pack-years of cigarette smoking.  There was also no clear evidence for effect 
modification by cigarette smoking status in either the ESCAPE study or in CPS-II, 
though in CPS-II the HR for never smokers was also somewhat larger (HR per 4.4 
µg/m3 = 1.21 (95% CI 1.01-1.44)) than that for current or former smokers.10  
Participation rates were high for both cases and controls (>80%).   
 
Limitations of the current work include the assignment of recent (2008-2011 average) 
estimates of ambient PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations from European land-use regression 
models to the participant residence at enrollment in 1998-2001.  However, study 
participants were residentially stable with a mean (SD) length of time in the enrollment 
residence of 27.8 (17.2) years.   Results were also similar in sensitivity analyses with 
atleast 5, 10, or 20 years in the current residence, both overall and in never smokers (not 
shown).  It is also unclear the most relevant exposure time window of interest here 
which may extend for several decades prior to enrollment.  We also required 
assumptions regarding the temporal stability of the spatial distribution of ambient air 
pollution concentrations over time.  PM2.5 concentrations, and to a lesser extent NO2, 
generally exhibited a gradual similar decline during the recent decade from 2001-2012 
in Spain in both urban and regional background sites, with a sharper decline observed 
during 2007-2008.21 Studies in other areas in Europe have also documented the spatial 
stability of the exposure contrast over time.22-24  Finally, there was limited variability in 
PM2.5 concentrations within each study region as compared to between study regions, in

both the European and local models (not shown), thereby limiting our ability to detect 
associations with bladder cancer incidence here and leading to imprecision in relative 
risk estimates. 
 
The hospital-based nature of the study design may also result in some form of bias if 
control diagnoses were somehow related with ambient air pollution exposure, which is 
unlikely here with hernias and fractures comprising the majority of the control 
population.  Participating hospitals captured study participants from broad geographical 
areas and none was a cancer referral centre.  Though there may be some degree of 
overmatching on air pollution exposure based on enrollment address, matching by 
region of residence was based on wide geographic zones, balanced for case and control 
participants.  
 
In summary, this large case-control study examining ambient PM2.5 and NO2 
concentrations and bladder cancer risk observed no clear evidence for associations.  
Further research in other large-scale population studies of cancer incidence is needed 
with detailed information on measured or modeled estimates of ambient air pollution 
concentrations, particularly with detailed data on more historical estimates of exposure, 
and individual level risk factor data.

Novelty and Impact: 
Novelty and Impact: Outdoor air pollution and particulate matter in outdoor air have been linked 
to increased lung cancer risk. However, evidence for other cancer sites is limited. In this study, 
the authors examined associations between ambient PM2.5, NO2 concentrations based on 
European multi-city land-use regression models, and bladder cancer risk in the large-scale 
Spanish Bladder Cancer Study. They found no clear associations with incident bladder cancer 
risk. Further research in other large-scale population studies is needed to confirm these results.
