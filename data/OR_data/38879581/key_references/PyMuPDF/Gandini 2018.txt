Background: The LIFE MED HISS project aims at setting up a surveillance system on the long term effects of air
pollution on health, using data from National Health Interview Surveys and other currently available sources of
information in most European countries. Few studies assessed the long term effect of air pollution on hospital
admissions in European cohorts.
Objective: The objective of this paper is to estimate the long term effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on first-ever (incident) cause-specific hospitalizations in Italy.
Methods: We used data from the Italian Longitudinal Study (ILS), a cohort study based on the 1999–2000
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), followed up for hospitalization (2001–2008) at individual level. The
survey contains information on crucial potential confounders: occupational/educational/marital status, body
mass index (BMI), smoking habit and physical activity.
Annual mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 was assigned starting from simulated gridded data at spatial re-
solution of 4 × 4 km2 firstly integrated with data from monitoring stations and then up-scaled at municipality
level.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Cox proportional hazard models with robust variance estimator.
Results: For each cause of hospitalization we estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for confounders with
95% Confidence Interval (CI) related to a 10 μg/m3 increase in pollutants. For PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, we
found positive associations for circulatory system diseases [1.05(1.03–1.06); 1.05(1.03–1.07)], myocardial in-
farction [1.15(1.12–1.18); 1.15(1.12–1.18)], lung cancer [1.18(1.10–1.26); 1.20(1.12–1.28)], kidney cancer
[1.24(1.11–1.29); 1.20(1.07–1.33)], all cancers (but lung) [1.06(1.04–1.08); 1.06(1.04–1.08)] and Low
Respiratory Tract Infections (LRTI) [1.07 (1.04–1.11); 1.05 (1.02–1.08)].
Discussion: Our results add new evidence on the effects of air pollution on first-ever (incident) hospitalizations,
both in urban and rural areas. We demonstrated the feasibility of a low-cost monitoring system based on
available data.

1. Introduction
The association between the exposure to major airborne pollutants
and several long term adverse effects on mortality has been well
documented (Hoek et al., 2013) but relatively few studies focused on
the long term effects of particulate (PM10 and PM2.5) or NO2 on hos-
pital admissions. Available studies have investigated the association
between airborne pollution and some specific causes of hospitaliza-
tions: acute coronary events (Cesaroni et al., 2014), stroke (Andersen
et al., 2012a; Kloog et al., 2012; Alimohammadi et al., 2016), asthma
(Andersen et al., 2012a), respiratory illness or specifically Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) (Hruba et al., 2001; Andersen
et al., 2011; Kloog et al., 2012; Atkinson et al., 2015), cerebrovascular
diseases (Stafoggia et al., 2014; Kloog et al., 2012; Oudin et al., 2010),
neurodegenerative diseases (Kioumourtzoglou et al., 2016) and dia-
betes (Kloog et al., 2012; Andersen et al., 2012b). These studies were
mostly carried out in USA, where both the characteristics and sus-
ceptibility of the population exposed and the composition of air pol-
lution mixture can be different from European context. Several cohorts
are available in Europe, as the national English cohort (812,063 pa-
tients aged 40–89 years as reported by Atkinson et al., 2015), the
Danish Diet, Cancer, and Health (DCH) cohort (57,053 people from
Copenhagen or Aarhus aged 50–65 years, as reported by Andersen
et al., 2012a) or the London cohort, which studied also combined ef-
fects of noise and air pollution (Halonen et al., 2015).
Earlier studies on long term effect had limitations on the exposure
assessment, due to the lack of air quality monitoring networks able to
represent large areas or countries, which led to study only restricted
areas. In recent years, the quality of the exposure assessment has been
improved, using prediction models for exposure which combine land
use regression with physical measurements or using atmospheric
Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) and satellite data. With these new
techniques it is possible to investigate both long and short term effects
on adverse health effect on wide areas; an example is the study of Kloog
et al. (2012) and (2015) which investigated the effects of pollutants on
hospital admissions across New-England or Cesaroni et al. (2013) for
mortality. However, even though a large amount of population is in-
volved in these studies, they are usually based on available health data
from registers or on ecological data, with a consequent approximation
in the control for individual potential confounders, such as diet, socio-
economic variables, physical activity, etc. For some of the investigated
diseases, the debate on the real role played by the air pollutants on
hospital admissions incidence is still ongoing: for COPD, an acute event,
as the primary outcome, it cannot be unambiguously distinguished the
role of air pollution in exacerbating COPD (developed due to other
causes) from its etiological contribution to the development of COPD
(Schikowski et al., 2014). Papers mentioned that asthma hospitalization
could be a bad marker of asthma onset and thus could underrate the
real asthma burden, with only a fraction of asthma patients hospitalized
(Andersen et al., 2012a). For diabetes, an accurate and large study
concluded that the risk for diabetes was only weakly associated with
increasing mean levels of traffic-related air pollution, with indication of
interaction, while the risks were higher in nonsmokers and physically
active people (Andersen et al., 2012c).
The LIFE MED HISS project (LIFE MED HISS, 2013) is a pilot study
aimed at estimating long-term effects of air pollution in four European
Mediterranean countries (Italy, France, Slovenia and Spain), using al-
ready available or potentially available cohorts. These are based on the
follow-up from the NHISs, a solution that offers wide information on
almost all potential confounders needed. The aim of the project is to
demonstrate the feasibility of this new approach and its possible ap-
plication in other EU countries, since all perform regularly health in-
terview and examination surveys (Hupkens et al., 1999). The approach
is based on the linkage of individual survey's data, with mortality and
hospitalization outcomes, where privacy regulations permit it, and with
exposure data at the place of residence derived from national air
pollution models. In countries where linkage was not possible because
of privacy policy restrictions, the MED HISS project tested an ecological
approach (Basagaña, 2015; de Keijzer et al., 2016). In both approaches,
exposure to air pollution has been assigned using data coming from
CTMs, where accuracy has been improved with monitoring station data
by means of data fusion techniques (Gandini et al., 2016; Ghigo et al.,
2017).
In this paper we present the results of MED HISS approach in Italy,
where no privacy policy restrictions have arisen and linkage between
survey's data and hospitalization outcomes has been possible. We used
the data of the ILS, a cohort based on the NHIS followed up for mor-
tality and hospitalization, and we evaluated the long term effects on
hospital admissions related to air pollution exposure in the sample
living in all the Italian national territory, covering both urban and rural
areas. We studied the association between air pollution concentrations
at municipal level and the risk of first-ever (incident) hospital admis-
sion for several causes, controlling for main individual confounders,
including lifestyle and socioeconomic information. The use of first-ever
hospitalization allows to approximate a measure of incidence of pa-
thology. All results are stratified by gender and level of urbanization.
Thanks to the nature of the ILS, we were able to analyze a wide list of
causes, adding knowledge where few studies were available (like e.g.
atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Health data
The ILS is a follow-up study based on the sample included in the
1999–2000 NHIS, carried out by the National Institute of Statistics,
linked to mortality and hospital records (Marinacci et al., 2013). The
original NHIS sample consists of 140,011 individuals belonging to
52,232 sampled families resident in 1449 municipalities in the whole
national territory (Fig. 1). The NHIS contains, beside others, individual
information on age, gender, occupational and educational status,
marital status, residence, BMI, smoking habit and physical activity.
Information on alcohol was not available in the survey, while in-
formation on diet was limited to particular conditions (e.g. macrobiotic
diet) and therefore could not be used to assess lifestyles. Concerning
residence, we had no information about home address due to privacy
restrictions and we could only know the municipality of residence for
each individual.
Due to the nature of the LIFE MED HISS project, variables included
in the model are harmonized, according to the standard developed
within the European EUROTHINE project (EUROTHINE 2005), en-
suring a high degree of comparability with other European surveys, also
considering levels chosen for categorical variables.
An individual record-linkage procedure was applied to the 128,818
individuals with complete personal data and giving consensus to be
followed-up (92% of the total sample). Follow up for hospital admis-
sions in this paper covers the period 2001–2008. Analyses on associa-
tion between air pollution and adverse health effects are conducted on
74,989 individuals (belonging to 45,418 sampled families resident in
1442 municipalities) aged > 35 years and alive at 2001: in this sub-
cohort, 41,047 individuals experienced at least one hospital admission.
We excluded non-accidental causes and repeated hospitalizations for
the same subject (with the exceptions of myocardial infarction, angina
pectoris and LRTI).
For each cause, we considered only the main cause of hospitaliza-
tion out of six available, and, for each subject, only the first hospital
admission, excluding all subsequent hospitalization for the same cause.
This criterion permits to have a good approximation to an incidence
measure. An exception to this rule was done for diabetes and COPD,
which were searched among all six codes. A second type of exception
was done for myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and LRTI: for the
first two causes, a second event that occurred after 28 days or more

from the first episode was considered as a new event (Thygensen et al.,
2012), whereas for LRTI the time elapsed from the first episode to
consider it as a new event had to be 90 days or more.
We selected the following main group of causes: disease of the cir-
culatory system (ICD-9 code 390–459), heart diseases (ICD-9 code
390–429), cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-9 code 430–438), diseases of
the respiratory system (ICD-9 code 460–519), all neoplasm but lung
cancer (ICD-9 code 140–239, with the exception of 162), mental, be-
havioural and neurodevelopmental disorders (ICD-9 code 290–319),
diseases of the nervous system (ICD-9 code 320–359).
Moreover, we investigated the following specific causes: lung cancer
(ICD-9 code 162), bladder cancer (ICD-9 code 188), kidney cancer (ICD-
9 code 189), diabetes (ICD-9 code 250), Parkinson's disease (ICD-9 code
332), Alzheimer's disease (ICD-9 code 331), myocardial infarction (ICD-
9 code 410), angina pectoris (ICD-9 code 413) atherosclerosis (ICD-9
code 440), LRTI (ICD-9 code 466, 480–487), chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD) (ICD-9 code 490–492, 494, 496), asthma (ICD-
9 code 493), and miscarriage (ICD-9 code 634).
2.2. Exposure to air pollution
The Italian exposure model takes into account data coming from the
modeling system MINNI (National Integrated Modelling system for
International Negotiation on atmospheric pollution), developed and
validated by ENEA and the Italian Ministry of the Environment Land
and Sea (Mircea et al., 2014; Mircea et al., 2016). MINNI includes an
atmospheric chemical transport model (CTM) fed by emission data
(national emission inventory of anthropogenic sources, biogenic VOCs,
sea-salt, natural dust) and meteorological prognostic fields. MINNI
outputs for PM2.5 and NO2 were provided for years 1999, 2003, 2005
and 2007 at a spatial resolution representative of urban background
pollution levels (4 × 4 km2) at hourly resolution (Mircea et al., 2014).
The CTM model included in the MINNI modeling system is called FARM
(Gariazzo et al., 2007; Silibello et al., 2008) and the version used in the
study is the 3.1.12.
In order to reduce model uncertainty, a data fusion technique is
used
to
combine
MINNI
concentration
fields
and
pollutant
observations. Thus, it is possible to provide a more realistic re-
presentation of pollutant spatial distribution. Therefore, a Kriging with
External Drift (KED, Van de Kassteele et al., 2009; Ignaccolo et al.,
2013) procedure has been used to account for the observed data into
MINNI fields. Specifically, the kriging is applied on the observed data
and the external drift is constituted by the MINNI model output. Ob-
servations were interpreted as realizations of a Gaussian spatial process
Y(s) at spatial location s, in the domain S. Y(s) has the following
structure:
=
+
+
Y s
µ s
w s
s
( )
( )
( )
( ),
where in the trend component μ(s) the MINNI model output is in-
troduced, w(s) is a stationary Gaussian random process and ε(s) is the
error term. Regarding observed data introduced in the dispersion model
outputs, we retrieved data from other Italian regional environmental
agencies out of BRACE database (national system: http://www.brace.
sinanet.apat.it/). Only background stations, whose spatial representa-
tiveness is consistent with the MINNI resolution, and only monitoring
sites with > 80% of data have been considered and averaged to obtain
annual observed values (Ghigo et al., 2017).
PM2.5 and NO2 are the most impacting pollutants on the Italian
territory, in terms of long-term effect on human health. Also SO2 and
CO have historically been of high impact, but their airborne levels have
been drastically reduced before year 2000, therefore their impact is
very low in the time span analyzed in this study. Black carbon was
included in official EU emission inventories in 2017, so no national
emission data were available at the time of this study.
Since the health data from the NHIS are aggregated at the municipal
level, the exposure assessment has to rely on the same spatial scale.
Therefore, following this data fusion approach, the Italian exposure
assessment was carried out by up-scaling the gridded data at the mu-
nicipality level (Ignaccolo et al., 2013). These annual exposure maps
were obtained overlying gridded concentration data to municipality
boundaries and then using a weighted average, where built-up area
percentages were the weights. Built-up area information has been col-
lected from Corine Land Cover data (CORINE, 2006) using land use
classes belonging to Artificial Surfaces categories. In this way, for both

pollutants a mean annual value has been calculated for all Italian mu-
nicipalities (Fig. 1).
2.3. Statistical analyses
For each of the analyzed outcomes, the individual effect of long-
term exposure to air pollution on hospitalization is modelled using the
Cox proportional hazard model, with air pollution levels and age class
as time-varying variables, while adjusting for other variables. Robust
variance estimates are produced to take into account the two-stage
sampling strategy used by ISTAT (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica) in the
survey (sampling municipalities at the first stage and households within
each municipality at the second stage, and enrolling all the individuals
of the sampled families).
We estimate hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for gender, educational
level (classified according to the international classification ISCED and
grouped into the four classes: up to primary, corresponding to ISCED
0–1, lower secondary, ISCED 2 and 3C, upper secondary, ISCED 3A and 3B
and post secondary, ISCED 4–6), marital status (living with partner/not
living with partner), occupational status (employed/not employed),
smoking habit (current smoker, former smoker, never smoker), physical
activity (4 different levels combining information on type and fre-
quency of activity) and BMI. The individual characteristics are known
only at the time of the interview. For each subject we define the re-
sidence based on type of municipality according to the population size:
metropolitan areas (municipalities with > 250,000 inhabitants), urban
areas (between 20,000 and 250,000 inhabitants) and rural areas (mu-
nicipalities with < 20,000 inhabitants).
The idea of LIFE MED HISS project is to obtain the maximum in-
formation from sources already available. Since we had four years of air
pollution exposure (from 1999 to 2007), which were subsequent to the
enrollment of the cohort, we did not find appropriate to use air pollu-
tion as time-dependent variable using only the most recent year of
exposure, as done in other studies (Nafstad et al., 2004). Therefore, we
divided the follow-up period in 4 risk sets and computed the annual
exposure value of each risk set as the mean exposure of all the pre-
ceding years for which the data was available, as follows:
• 1999–2002 (exposure in 1999)
• 2003–2004 (mean exposure of 1999 and 2003)
• 2005–2006 (mean exposure of 1999, 2003 and 2005)
• 2007–2008 (mean exposure of 1999, 2003, 2005 and 2007)
Sensitivity analyses have been done using only one year of exposure
(2005).
Due to the nature of data and consequently of the exposure as-
sessment, which assigns one single value over the whole city, the results
are presented also by municipality size population, according to the
residence, for rural, urban and metropolitan areas.
The proportional hazard assumption was tested for all the fixed
predictors and stratified Cox models were applied for predictors that
did not meet the assumption.
For each outcome, we evaluated potential effect modification by
adding into the model the proper interaction term of exposure by
modifier. We used the likelihood ratio test to compare the models with
and without interaction terms.
Due to the heterogeneous spatial coverage of monitoring stations in
Northern and Central Italy (dense spatial coverage) and Southern Italy
(sparse spatial coverage), sensitivity analyses are also presented re-
stricted to the first domain.
All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute
Inc., 2013) and R, version 3.3.3 (R Core Team, 2017).
3. Results
Analyses on association between air pollution and hospital admis-
sions are performed on 74,989 individuals aged > 35 years and alive
at 2001.
Table 1 shows the distribution of sample characteristics, overall and
stratified by size of the municipality of residence. Due to space con-
straints, pollutants are described only in 2005, but distributions do not
change substantially in the other years.
Most individuals live in rural areas (60.6%), while only 8.4% of the
population is resident in the twelve metropolitan cities with > 250,000
inhabitants (Rome, Milan, Naples, Turin, Palermo, Genoa, Bologna,
Florence, Bari, Catania, Venice and Verona). In our cohort, 70.2% is be-
tween 35 and 65 years, with 2.8% of people aged over 85; 46.8% is normal
weight and 11.9% is obese, with 0.2% with severe obesity. Most families are
composed by person living with a partner (83.3%). Concerning physical
activity, 46.7% is totally inactive. Educational level is categorized according
to ISCED, with the highest percentage (46.6%) belonging to ISCED 0–1 (low
education level), mainly concentrated in rural areas. Variables included in
the analyses are compiled for all individuals. Mean and standard deviation
of PM2.5 and NO2 in 2005 are also shown in Table 1: the distribution of the
pollutants looks invariant to each category of all the variables included in
the analysis. If we consider only year 2005 for exposure, 76.3% and 79.1%
of the individuals are exposed to concentration ranging between 10 and
30 μg/m3, for NO2 and PM2.5 respectively (Table 2).
Table 3 shows HRs with 95% CI of cause-specific hospitalization
for 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and NO2. For PM2.5 and NO2,
respectively, we found positive associations for circulatory system
diseases [1.05(1.03–1.06); 1.05(1.03–1.07)], myocardial infarction
[1.15(1.12–1.18); 1.15(1.12–1.18)], lung cancer [1.18(1.10–1.26);
1.20(1.12–1.28)], kidney cancer [1.24(1.11–1.29); 1.20(1.07–1.33)],
neoplasms (lung cancer excluded) [1.06(1.04–1.08); 1.06(1.04–1.08)]
and LRTI [1.10 (1.04–1.15); 1.05 (1.01–1.10)]. Significant associations
is also found with NO2, and hospital admissions for atherosclerosis
[1.10(1.03–1.17)]. We found negative associations for hospital admis-
sions related to COPD [0.90(0.86–0.94); 0.94(0.90–0.97) for PM2.5 and
NO2 respectively].
Table 4 shows results stratified, for rural areas, urban areas and
metropolitan areas. When main results are reported by municipalities'
population size, metropolitan areas do not show significant results for
most of causes.
Results stratified by gender are reported in Table 5. The risk of both
lung, kidney and urinary cancer is higher in women than in men for
both the air pollutants, on the contrary the effects of PM2.5 and NO2 are
the same for neoplasm (lung cancer excluded) hospitalization.

Focusing on lung cancer (Table 6), HRs are higher and robust even
among non-smokers and former smokers [1.17 (1.04–1.31) and 1.16
(1.04–1.29) for PM2.5 and NO2 for non-smokers; 1.16 (0.99–1.35) and
1.19 (1.03–1.38) for PM2.5 and NO2 for former smokers]. Risks are also
higher among sedentary people or who practice light physical activity,
with about 20% excess of risk in both categories and for both pollu-
tants. Considering BMI as a categorical variable, also obese and over-
weight people show higher HRs.
Since in the Southern part of Italy the spatial coverage of monitoring
stations is lower, with potentially less accurate exposure assessment, a
sensitivity analysis has been performed restricted to the northern and
central regions of Italy. Considering overall results (reported in Table
S1 of supplemental material), risks for hospital admissions for circula-
tory diseases are lower (respectively 1.03 (1.01–1.05) and 1.03
(1.01–1.05) for PM2.5 and NO2), whereas risk estimates for asthma
causes are higher [respectively 1.26 (1.06–1.50) and 1.27 (1.02–1.58)
for PM2.5 and NO2].
Sensitivity analyses have been performed also assigning to each
subject only the year 2005 for exposure (Table S2 in supplemental
material) in which spatial coverage of monitoring stations is robust also
for PM2.5. HRs are similar to those estimated with time-dependent
exposure assessment (1999–2007), only slightly attenuated for NO2 and
amplified for PM2.5.
4. Discussion
In this study we investigated the long term effect of air pollution on
a wide series of causes of hospitalization using the follow-up of the
1999–2000 Italian Health Interview Survey.
PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with an increased risk of hospita-
lization for cardiovascular diseases (in particular myocardial infarc-
tion), cancer (with a stronger effect for lung and kidney cancer), LRTI
and nervous system diseases.
The proposed low-cost approach, suitable for surveillance, is based
on linking resources like air pollution prediction models, mortality and
hospital admissions registries and National Health Interview Surveys,
the latter being already available and mandatory in all European
countries. This record linkage has permitted the investigation of the
impact of air pollution on a European cohort in the Mediterranean area.
A peculiarity of this cohort is the availability of individual information,
which naturally arises from the questionnaire. This allows controlling
for individual potential confounders; besides, the NHIS contains a
sample representative of the population spread in the whole national
territory, covering both urban and rural areas. Thanks to the CTMs, the
problem of having a limited number of PM2.5 monitors is overcome.
MINNI system covers the whole national territory providing a measure
of exposure for each municipality, including also rural and suburban
populations which are far from monitoring stations.
As expected, a clear effect was seen for lung cancer hospital ad-
missions. The focus on lung cancer confirms literature findings, en-
suring the robustness of the use of the NHISs for epidemiological pur-
poses in environmental field (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2011). The use of
information on individual behaviours allowed showing risks for some
categories: non-smokers experience the known risks, subject that do not
perform physical activity and/or overweight or obese experience the
highest risks.
However, the employment of land use regression models, as well as
more detailed personal exposure assessment, which can include vari-
ables like distance from major roads (see for example Hystad et al.,
2013), could be recommended to ensure more robust results in me-
tropolitan areas, when more detailed information about home address
is not limited by privacy regulation.
Significant risks are also seen considering all neoplasms, even ex-
cluding the contribution of lung cancer. Results also suggest a re-
lationship between air pollution exposure and kidney cancer, indicating
the potential effect of air pollutants on tissues more exposed to che-
micals, also for their de-toxifying function.
Results obtained for circulatory diseases (both for PM2.5 and NO2)
confirm the putative biological mechanisms linking long term exposure
to air pollution and cardiovascular diseases, which involves direct ef-
fects of pollutants on the cardiovascular system, blood, and lung re-
ceptors, and/or indirect effects mediated through pulmonary oxidative
stress and inflammatory responses (Kloog et al., 2012). Risks are sta-
tistically significant also stratified by gender and by level of munici-
pality population size. Results are substantially confirmed (with the
exception of asthma) when restricted to the Northern and Central part
of Italy, where the spatial coverage of monitoring stations is higher and
improves CTMs data.

Results obtained for atherosclerosis (particularly for NO2) confirm
recent findings of coronary artery calcification within six metropolitan
areas in the USA (Kaufman et al., 2016) and the results of ESCAPE on a
preclinical marker of atherosclerosis (intima-media thickness of the
common carotid artery) (Perez et al., 2015). Increased concentrations
of PM2.5 and traffic-related air pollution within metropolitan areas are
associated with progression in coronary calcification, consistent with
acceleration of atherosclerosis. Considering myocardial infarction, few
studies are available in the literature until now, whereas many studies
focus on short-term effect (Bhaskaran et al., 2009). Our study supports
the evidence of an effect of long-term exposure to air pollution on
myocardial infarction.
It is known that the biological mechanisms linking long term ex-
posure to air pollution and respiratory diseases include reduced lung
function, pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress.
Nevertheless, in our study no results are obtained for the whole
group of respiratory diseases. If we investigate more specific causes of
hospitalization, we see a clear effect of air pollution on LRTI and a
suggestion on relationship with asthma, with all the known limitations
to this type of hospital admissions. Risks for COPD are still an open
issue with controversial results (Atkinson et al., 2015), while a causal
role of air pollution in the induction of COPD would be biologically
plausible (Schikowski et al., 2014). Following Schikowski, in spite of
plausible models of biological mechanisms, direct epidemiological evidence
of the long-term effects of air pollution on COPD prevalence and incidence
remains suggestive but not conclusive. In LIFE MED HISS, a protective
effect has been seen but this can also be due to competitive risks: since
COPD, lung cancer and ischaemic diseases share a common risk factor
(smoking) and in addition the hospitalization for COPD should not
happen (it is considered inappropriate because this disease should be
managed at home) it is likely that people who smoke and whose con-
ditions are exacerbated by air pollution have been hospitalized for lung
cancer or myocardial infarction rather than for COPD.
In contrast to what previously published (Kloog et al., 2012), we
have not seen significant risk for diabetes and this could be an effect of
the protective effect of Mediterranean diet which is spread among all
the Italian population and could have mitigated the metabolic effect of
chemicals. Concerning risks for urban and rural areas, there is no clear

evidence of higher risks in one of the two subgroups, but this seems to
depend on the cause selected (Table 4). Information on alcohol and diet
would have helped to clarify this topic, because of different behaviour
among the two groups.
Controversial results obtained for metropolitan areas can be a
combination of exposure misclassification and of the small amount of
individuals sampled in these study areas. Considering not significant
HRs obtained for lung cancer in cities with > 250,000 inhabitants, the
use of a single concentration value for metropolitan areas could be a
source of potential exposure misclassification, given the large within-
city range. However, this source of bias is due to the lack of more de-
tailed information about home address or residential postcode, avoid-
able if privacy policies would have permitted access to information at
least on zip codes. The lack of permission has forced the use of con-
centration values at municipality level.
The lack of updated information for individual confounders and
residential history is the major weakness of the use of Italian
Longitudinal Study. Internal Italian mobility is about 1 million and a
half every year, over a population of about 59 million of inhabitants
(about 2.5%). In year 2009, 1,312,763 individuals changed their re-
sidence within Italian territory, whereas mobility outside Italian terri-
tory is 39,000 (ISTAT, 2016). Taking into account relatively low mo-
bility rates of Italian people and providing that factors which influence
mobility are not only related to environmental factors, an eventual non-
differential misclassification is more likely to reduce the effect towards
the null, as epidemiological literature generally suggests.
We used the exposure information as a proxy of past exposures.
Having verified that in the Italian territory there were no differential
temporal trends of the pollutants under investigation between me-
tropolitan, urban and rural areas (Figs. 2 and 3), we trusted the use of
the whole information available. The time-dependent approach aims at
maximizing the information on exposure using available data. In this
study the first year of the exposure available is contemporary to the
time of the interview. Sensitivity analyses performed using only year
2005 (first year with an adequate spatial coverage of monitoring sta-
tions both for PM2.5 and for NO2) seemed to show higher risks asso-
ciated to particulate matter. This may suggest that the use of a time-
dependent approach, including years in the past, could lead to con-
servative results due to less accuracy in particulate exposure measure.
The adopted methodology correctly reproduces concentration mean

levels typical of urban background stations, consistent with the MINNI
spatial resolution. The system (MINNI-KED) underestimates observed
levels at traffic stations in urban areas that are phenomena occurring at
scales that cannot be solved at the adopted spatial resolution. This is a
common problem of state-of-art national CTMs (Aguilera et al., 2013;
Kiesewetter et al., 2014), likely to be solved in the future with routine
application of more detailed modeling of urban areas. Moreover, up-
scaling from gridded data to municipality level, needed to match the
health data, preserves concentrations levels and main spatial patterns,
but it amplifies the inability to capture spatial variations of small scale.
5. Conclusion
The MED-HISS project is a pilot study that tested the applicability of
surveillance systems for European countries, thanks to relative cheap-
ness in comparison to traditional cohort studies. Results obtained are
consistent with the literature, as is the case for lung cancer, and
demonstrated the feasibility of this approach, with the possibility to
study a broad range of causes (IARC, 2013). The applied methodology
provided consistent estimates useful to describe the exposure of large
population for surveillance purposes.
To carry on this kind of studies it is necessary that privacy policies
permit to link each individual of the survey with his health history.
European surveys are representative of population at some different
level of urbanization. This permits to have a large amount of the cohort
living in rural areas, which are less polluted, but usually also less stu-
died.
Regarding exposure to air pollution we have implemented a meth-
odology taking into account data coming from CTMs and air quality
monitoring network. Firstly, trough KED, observations were fused in
pollutant concentration fields and secondly a weighted average proce-
dure was used to up-scale assimilated concentration fields at munici-
pality scale. The adopted methodology produced satisfactory results
and consistent exposure estimates at municipality level.

Due to the nature of the study, a wide list of causes has been ana-
lyzed, controlling for confounders at individual level. The availability
of confounders depends on the survey. In this study we have identified a
core set of variables which have a high degree of comparability with
other European surveys. In the Italian Longitudinal Study, we have the
strong limitation of having no information on alcohol consumption and
on diet. However, subsequent surveys partially overcome this problem,
but nowadays there is no follow-up with hospital admissions. Due to
privacy restrictions we do not have more detailed information on re-
sidence than the municipality level, which could be a source of bias
when studying metropolitan areas. Since only 8% of the cohort lives in
metropolitan areas, this has a low impact on results from the Italian
Longitudinal Study. A major source of misclassification is the lack of
residential history before and after the interview, but the low rate of
Italian mobility limits this problem.
Results obtained confirm the relationship measured in other studies
on air pollution and hospital admissions, and add new evidence for
causes with few studies available (e.g. myocardial infarction). Evidence
arises for circulatory system, also when considering more specific
causes like cerebrovascular disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial in-
farction and angina. Results for lung cancer confirm what already
published. New issues are added considering all neoplasms (having
excluded lung cancer) and kidney cancer. A study using a wider follow-
up and using a cohort derived from a more recent survey is ongoing.
