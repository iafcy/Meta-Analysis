Introduction
Outdoor air pollution is a leading contributor to the global bur-
den of disease.1 Outdoor air pollution is a complex mixture of 
particles and irritant gases such as organic aerosols, heavy met-
als, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).2 Once inhaled, those pollutants 
can penetrate deeper into the lungs and are carried by the blood-
stream throughout the body. A recent global review showed that 
chronic exposure to air pollution can affect almost every organ 
in the body, causing a variety of diseases and conditions.3
In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
identified air pollution as a group 1 carcinogen for lung cancer.4 
For other cancers, genotoxicity and molecular biomarker data 
from experimental studies demonstrated that air pollution is 
associated with altered gene expressions, inflammation, and oxi-
dative stress in tissues other than the lung, indicating potential 
links between air pollution and the risk of developing various 
types of cancers.5–8 Epidemiologic evidence on air pollution and 
other cancers remained largely lacking but was growing sub-
stantially in recent years.9–12 Nevertheless, most existing studies 
had relatively short follow-up periods and evaluated exposures 
from one up to a few years before cancer diagnosis.13–16 Due to 
cancer’s long latency period, those studies might not be able to 
adequately identify critical windows of susceptibility or capture 
the full effect. Besides, previous studies were limited to small 
unrepresentative samples, which was further complicated by 
the heterogeneity in cancer.17–19 Additionally, previous studies 
had reported risks on a multiplicative scale, which obscured 
the actual size of the risk and are more difficult to interpret 
What this study adds
Although air pollution has been identified as a carcinogen for 
lung cancer, the relation between air pollution and other pri-
mary cancers remained largely unquantified. We estimated the 
simultaneous associations of 10-year exposures to fine particu-
late matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the risks of 
breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers among the 
national Medicare cohort between 2000 and 2016. Our results 
showed that PM2.5 and NO2 exposures increased the risks of 
colorectal and prostate cancers. At low exposure levels, we 
observed substantially larger associations between most expo-
sures and the risks of all cancers.

Background: Epidemiologic evidence on the relationships between air pollution and the risks of primary cancers other than 
lung ­cancer remained largely lacking. We aimed to examine associations of 10-year exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and 
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers.
Methods: For each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort among the national Medicare beneficiaries during 2000 to 2016. We 
simultaneously examined the additive associations of six exposures, namely, moving average exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 over the 
year of diagnosis and previous 2 years, previous 3 to 5 years, and previous 6 to 10 years, with the risk of first cancer diagnosis after 
10 years of follow-up, during which there was no cancer diagnosis.
Results: The cohorts included 2.2 to 6.5 million subjects for different cancers. Exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with 
increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2 was associated with a 
decreased risk of breast cancer, while the association for PM2.5 remained inconclusive. At exposure levels below the newly updated 
World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline, we observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the 
risks of all cancers, which were translated to hundreds to thousands new cancer cases per year within the cohort per unit increase 
in each exposure.
Conclusions: These findings suggested substantial cancer burden was associated with exposures to PM2.5 and NO2, emphasizing 
the urgent need for strategies to mitigate air pollution levels.

compared with the additive effect estimates.20 Further, the com-
peting risk of death was pervasive but commonly overlooked, 
leading to potential overestimation of the effect size.21
We aimed to examine the simultaneous associations of 10-year 
exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and NO2, the two 
major primary pollutants emitted directly from fossil fuel and 
biomass combustion sources, on the risks of breast, prostate, 
colorectal, and endometrial cancers, for national Medicare ben-
eficiaries ≥65 years of age with continuous enrollment in the 
Fee-for-Service (FFS) program and in the Medicare Parts A and 
B. To provide a better sense of the risk posed by the pollutants, 
we estimated additive associations and translated them to the 
numbers of new cancer cases per unit increase in each exposure, 
accounting for the competing risk of death.
Methods
Study population and design
We obtained the Medicare denominator file and the Medicare 
Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) from the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services.22 The Medicare denominator 
file contained enrollment records and demographic information, 
including sex, race/ethnicity, age, Medicaid enrollment status (a 
marker of low socioeconomic status), ZIP code of residence, 
and date of death (if any), for each Medicare beneficiary. Age, 
Medicaid enrollment status, and ZIP code of residence were 
updated annually. The CCW contained the date of the first 
occurrence of cancer diagnosis for each cancer type across all 
available claims in the FFS and the Medicare Parts A (inpa-
tient) and B (outpatient, physician service, home health, etc.). 
To reduce the chance of missing cancer diagnoses, we restricted 
the cohort to beneficiaries with continuous enrollment in FFS 
and in both Part A and Part B throughout the follow-up period. 
This was because if a beneficiary spent any time in the Medicare 
Advantage Plans (Part C), or only one of Parts A or B during 
the study period, there was the possibility that the cancer claims 
were not available for CCW.23
For each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort in which 
each beneficiary was followed since 2000 or entering the study. To 
allow for the assessment of the exposure effects over the 10 years 
before cancer diagnosis, we implemented an inclusion criterion 
that required a minimum follow-up period of 10 years after enroll-
ment, during which no cancer diagnosis occurred. That is, we only 
included beneficiaries who were cancer-free for the initial 10 years 
of follow-up. By applying the 10-year cancer-free inclusion crite-
rion, we also ensured that the first identified cancer diagnosis was 
an incidence case. If a beneficiary had been diagnosed with cancer 
before enrolling in Medicare, we believed they would have had 
a claim record for physician visit, treatment, hospitalization, etc. 
with cancer diagnosis within the first 10 years after study entry. 
After that, beneficiaries were censored at the first occurrence of 
cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of the study in 2016, whichever 
occurred earliest. We restricted the cohort to females for breast 
and endometrial cancers and males for prostate cancer.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards 
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Emory 
University.
Exposures
We predicted daily average outdoor PM2.5 and NO2 levels at 
1-km2 grid cells across the contiguous US using geographically 
weighted regressions that ensembled predictions from random 
forests, gradient boosting, and neural network.24–27 The predic-
tions integrated multiple data sources including satellite data, 
land-use variables, monitoring data, chemical transport model 
simulations, etc. The ensembled models demonstrated better 
predictive performance than that of the individual machine 
learners with 10-fold cross-validated R-squared values of 0.89 
for annual PM2.5 predictions and 0.84 for annual NO2 predic-
tions. This performance was in held-out monitors not used for 
model fitting. Based on these predictions at 1-km2 grid cells and 
ZIP code shapefiles provided by the Environmental Systems 
Research Institute (ESRI), we estimated concentrations at ZIP 
codes by averaging the predictions at grids whose centroids 
were inside the polygonal area for general ZIP codes, or assign-
ing the prediction at the nearest grid for other ZIP Codes that 
did not have polygon representations, such as apartment build-
ings, military bases, or post offices.28
The ZIP code-level concentrations were considered as proxy 
exposure measurements and were linked to each beneficiary in 
each year based on their residential ZIP codes. For each bene-
ficiary in each year, we examined three exposure windows: the 
moving average exposure over that year and the previous two 
years (lag 0–2 years), the moving average over the previous 3 to 
5 years (lag 3–5 years), and the moving average over the previ-
ous 6 to 10 years (lag 6–10 years).
Community-level covariates
We included a variety of annual, ZIP code-level covariates in 
the analysis as potential confounders and effect modifiers. The 
percent of ever smokers, average body mass index (BMI), and 
number of active medical doctors per 1000 people were derived 
from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the 
Area Health Resources Files.29,30 The percent White, percent 
Black, percent below poverty, percent rental housing, percent 
education below high school, and median household income 
were derived from the Decennial Census and the American 
Community Survey.31–33 The distance from the centroid of each 
ZIP code to the nearest hospital was calculated based on the 
ESRI’s hospital distribution files, which was considered as a 
proxy for average distance to the nearest hospital.34 The per-
cent of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who had a lip-
id-panel test in a year and the percent beneficiaries with at least 
one ambulatory doctor’s visit in a year were derived from the 
Dartmouth Health Atlas.35 Rurality, as measured by population 
density, was derived from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and 
Applications Center.36 The Normalized Difference Vegetation 
Index (NDVI), a measure of greenness that was associated with 
cancer incidence,37 was obtained from the NASA’s Moderate 
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land data products.38 
The national Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite mea-
sure of neighborhood disadvantage level, was obtained from the 
Neighborhood Atlas website.39
Statistical analysis
We had six exposures of interest, specifically lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 
5, and lag 6 to 10 exposures to PM2.5 and NO2. For each cancer 
and each exposure, to obtain the independent effect estimate, we 
employed an inverse probability weighting (IPW)-based addi-
tive model in which the other five exposures were adjusted as 
confounders.20,40 The analysis consisted of two stages: a design 
stage where the inverse probability weight (IPW) of each per-
son-year’s exposure was estimated to provide a scalar summary 
that can be used to eliminate confounding and competing risk 
through weighting, and an analysis stage where the additive 
association of the exposure with the cancer risk was estimated.
In the first stage, the IPW (swi) for person-year i was esti-
mated by
swi =
K (xi −¯x)
K (xi −ˆg (xi|ci)) ×
ˆg (Di = 0|xi)
ˆg (Di = 0|xi,
ci),

where K (·) represented a kernel density estimator; xi the expo-
sure level; ¯x the average exposure across all person-years; ci a 
set of confounders including the other five exposures, individual 
risk factors (sex [male or female], race/ethnicity [White, Black, 
or other], age group after initial 10-year cancer-free follow-up 
[75–84 or ≥85 years], and Medicaid enrollment status [yes or 
no]), and community-level covariates as delineated above; Di 
the indicator of death (0 or 1); and ˆg (·) a gradient boosting 
machine (GBM) prediction model with a gaussian loss func-
tion.41 Overall, the above function incorporated the stabilized 
IPWs for both confounding and competing risk of death. The 
use of nonparametric algorithms of kernel density and GBM 
had superior performance over parametric models in terms 
of bias and flexibility: the kernel density function relaxed 
the strong assumption of distributional form of the exposure 
residuals, and the GBM captured all possible nonlinearity and 
interactions of covariates and was unaffected by the potential 
autocorrelation.42,43 If the assumptions underlying the propen-
sity score were met, this would provide a causal model.40
In the analysis stage, we fitted the following linear probability 
model weighted by the IPWs obtained in the previous stage to 
estimate the additive association of the exposure with the abso-
lute cancer risk,
E (Yi = 1|xi) = β0 + β1xi,
where Yi was the outcome of cancer diagnosis (0 or 1). Given 
the estimated association ˆβ1, we further estimated the annual 
number of new cancer cases attributed to a unit increase in the 
exposure by
Annual number of new cancer cases = ˆβ1 ×
N
Duration of study,
where N was the total number of person-years of follow-up 
(including those of beneficiaries with cancer diagnoses in the 
first 10 years of follow-up) and the duration of study was 17 
years.
To examine whether the associations remained at low expo-
sure levels, for PM2.5, we repeated the whole analysis for per-
son-years with exposure levels at lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 
to 10 years all below 10 µg/m3; for NO2, we repeated the whole 
analysis for person-years with exposure levels at lag 0 to 2, lag 
3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years all below 20 parts per billion (ppb). 
We further examined the associations at stricter exposure levels, 
specifically the newly updated World Health Organization air 
quality guidelines ([AQG]; 5 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and 10 ppb for 
NO2).44
To examine whether certain subpopulations and communi-
ties experienced higher cancer risk in the impact of air pollution, 
we conducted separate analysis for each subgroup by age, sex 
(for colorectal cancer only), race/ethnicity, ever enrollment in 
Medicaid, and upper or lower quartile of community-level per-
cent of ever smokers, average BMI, population density, and ADI.
Results
The cohorts had 3.8 million participants for breast cancer, 6.5 
million for colorectal cancer, 4.0 million for endometrial cancer, 
and 2.2 million for prostate cancer. The cohorts predominantly 
consisted of Whites (>90%) and beneficiaries aged between 
75 and 84 years (>80%) after initial 10-year cancer-free fol-
low-up (Table 1). Beneficiaries excluded from the cohort due to 
a cancer diagnosis, death, or end of the study within the first 10 
years after the Medicare enrollment had larger population sizes, 
higher numbers of cancer diagnoses, and lower proportions of 
White (Table S1; http://links.lww.com/EE/A234). Over the study 
period between 2000 and 2016, the annual concentrations of 
PM2.5 averaged 9.8 µg/m3 and annual NO2 averaged 17.3 ppb 
(Table 2). For general ZIP Codes that had polygon represen-
tations, the average distance from a ZIP Code centroid to its 
boundary was ≈7.3 km; the fifth percentile corresponded to a 
distance of 1.2 km, while the 95th percentile represented a dis-
tance of 17.5 km.
Results of the main analysis and low-level analysis are shown 
in Table 3. For breast cancer, exposures to PM2.5 at lag 0 to 2 
and lag 3 to 5 years were statistically and significantly associ-
ated with decreased cancer risk, while at lag 6 to 10 year, the 
association was insignificant. Exposures to NO2 at lag 0 to 
2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years were all associated with 
increased breast cancer risk. In the low-level analysis in which 
the analysis was restricted to exposure levels below 10 µg/m3 for 
PM2.5 and below 20 ppb for NO2, both pollutants across the lag 
periods were associated with increased cancer risk. Notably, in 
the below-AQG analysis in which the analysis was restricted to 
exposure levels below 5 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and below 10 ppb for 
NO2, substantially larger positive associations were observed 
for both pollutants across the lag periods. These additive asso-
ciations were translated to hundreds to thousands of newly

PM2.5 were larger than those for NO2. In the low-level anal-
ysis, associations for PM2.5 were slightly larger than those for 
the main analysis, and for NO2 the associations attenuated with 
increasing lag periods. In the below-AQG analysis, substantially 
larger associations were observed for both pollutants, which 
were translated to hundreds to thousands of newly diagnosed 
colorectal cancer cases per year among the cohort.
For endometrial cancer, most associations were not statis-
tically significant across the entire exposure ranges. However, 
the lag 6 to 10 PM2.5 exposure was marginally and significantly 
associated with decreased cancer risk. In the low-level and 
below-AQG analyses, the associations for both pollutants atten-
uated with increasing lag periods.
For prostate cancer, all the exposures were associated with 
increased cancer risk across the entire exposure ranges. In the 
low-level analysis, all the effect sizes were larger compared with 
those in the full exposure ranges. In the below-AQG analysis, 
the associations became considerably larger, which were trans-
lated to hundreds to thousands of newly diagnosed prostate 
cancer cases per year among the cohort.
Susceptibility among subpopulations was mostly inconsistent 
across exposures and cancer types (Figure 1). For breast cancer, 
those who ever enrolled in Medicaid experienced higher risk 
associated with PM2.5 exposures over lag 3 to 5 and lag 6 to 
10 years, and those who lived in ZIP codes with higher BMI 
(>75th percentile) had higher risk for NO2 exposures at lag 0 to 
2 and lag 3 to 5 years. For colorectal cancer, those who lived in 
ZIP codes with higher rate of ever smokers (>75th percentile) or 
average BMI (>75th percentile) had higher risk associated with 
NO2 exposures at lag 0 to 2 and lag 3 to 5 years. For endome-
trial cancer, those who lived in ZIP codes with higher average 
BMI (>75th percentile) were at a higher cancer risk associated 
with lag 0 to 2 PM2.5 and lag 0 to 2 NO2 exposures. For prostate 
cancer, Blacks were at a higher cancer risk associated with PM2.5 
exposures across lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years, and 
those who lived in ZIP codes with higher average BMI (>75th 
percentile) had higher risk associated with NO2 exposures 
across lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years.
Discussion
In this cohort study of millions of Medicare beneficiaries 
across the contiguous US, we found clear evidence that chronic 
exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 increased the risks of colorectal 
and prostate cancers in a window of 10 years before diag-
nosis, consistent with the most recent epidemiological stud-
ies.11,13,14,16,17,45–47 Compared with previous studies, our study 
controlled for the competing risk of death, used propensity 
score and an additive model that provided marginal estimates 
of effect sizes, and found stronger associations at lower concen-
trations, including below the newly updated WHO guidelines. 
In the main analysis, when considering the mutually adjusted 
and independent additive effect estimates, the combined effects 
over three exposure windows were substantial: for colorectal 
cancer, an unit reduction in long-term PM2.5 and NO2 would 
prevent at least 705 and 95 annual incident cases within the 
cohort, respectively; for prostate cancer, an unit reduction in 
long-term PM2.5 and NO2 would prevent at least 460 and 223 
annual cases within the cohort, respectively. Given that the 
effect sizes were considerably larger at exposure levels below 
the newly updated WHO guidelines, further reducing the pollu-
tion levels would achieve greater health and economic benefits 
by preventing more cancers. In contrast, there was little evidence 
observed in our main analysis supporting the relevance of PM2.5 
and NO2 exposures to endometrial cancer risk, consistent with 
the Japan’s National Cancer Registry study.12 However, in the 
low-level and below-AQG analyses, the larger associations sug-
gested that there may be stronger relations between lower levels 
of PM2.5 and NO2 exposures and the risk of endometrial cancer, 
and the concentration-response relations may follow a nonlin-
ear pattern in an additive scale.
For breast cancer, the results can be interpreted as associa-
tions for postmenopausal breast cancer risk, considering that 
the Medicare cohort consisted of individuals aged 75 years or 
older at the time of diagnosis. In accord with Crouse et al.48 and 
Poulsen et al.13 who investigated the postmenopausal women, 
we found that NO2 was negatively associated with breast can-
cer incidence. Evidence for PM2.5 was less clear. Consistent with 
several large cohort studies,15,16,18,49–51 we detected both positive 
and negative association for PM2.5 across the entire exposure 
range. The mixed associations in our study and the previous 
studies may be due to the heterogeneous changes in chemical 
compositions and sources of PM2.5.19 The difference in PM2.5 
compositions may also explain the more varying results for 
PM2.5 than those for NO2. However, when restricting the anal-
ysis to lower exposure levels, where the compositions of local 
PM2.5 remained fairly stable,52 we found strongly and consis-
tently adverse impacts of PM2.5. Clearly, future studies with data 
on PM2.5 compositions are needed to explore the relations of 
specific chemical components with breast cancer risk. Similar to 
endometrial cancer, the substantially larger associations in the 
low-level and below-AQG analyses indicated that the effect of 
air pollution on breast cancer risk may be more pronounced at 
lower exposure levels.
Few studies had explored the potential impact of individual- 
and community-level factors on the susceptibility of cancer to 
air pollution.53 In this study, we found inconsistent subgroup 
differences across exposures and cancer types, possibly due to 
the complex etiology of different cancers.9 However, we found 
suggestive evidence indicating a disproportionately higher risk of 
all the cancers associated with NO2 exposures among individu-
als residing in communities with higher average BMI, suggesting 
that a lack of access to healthy food and limited opportunities 
for physical activities may contribute to an increased cancer sus-
ceptibility to the adverse effect of NO2.54 The finding of greater 
susceptibility of the Medicaid enrollees and Blacks to the PM2.5-
induced cancer risks was also important in terms of improving 
health equity. Blacks had been exposed to higher levels of air 
pollution,55 so the larger effect sizes resulted in an even greater 
injustice.
Our study had several strengths. First, the inclusion of millions 
of participants with long-term follow-up allowed for investigat-
ing the exposures later in life, from up to 10 years before cancer 
diagnosis, with ample statistical power. Second, the independent 
and additive associations made it possible to combine them to 
obtain the overall estimates for a window of 10 years before 
cancer diagnosis. As a result, adding up the individual effect 
estimates for each pollutant was a straightforward and valid 
approach that provided a better sense of its long-term impact. 
Third, the use of GBM and kernel density estimator achieved a 
high level of flexibility and accuracy for estimating IPW, mak-
ing the results robust against any observed confounding bias. 
Fourth, accounting for competing risk avoided the associations 
being overestimated.
This study also had limitations. First, restricted by available 
data sources, we could not capture individual-level risk factors 
such as smoking status and BMI, but used community-level 
smoking rate and average BMI as surrogates, which may lead 
to confounding bias. For breast cancer, it is important to note 
that reproductive factors and the use of hormone therapy 
were not available for the analysis.56 For colorectal cancer, 
the analysis did not account for alcohol consumption, a rec-
ognized risk factor.57 While these factors may not be directly 
associated with air pollution exposures and therefore may not 
confound the association between air pollution and cancer 
incidence, incorporating them in future research can still con-
tribute to obtaining more robust effect estimates. Second, the 
use of ZIP code-level exposures was subject to measurement

6
error, especially for NO2, which has greater spatial variabil-
ity.58 However, the larger ZIP codes were generally in less pop-
ulated and rural areas, where the spatial variability in NO2 
exposure may be smaller than in urban areas, where the ZIP 
codes are smaller. This may limit, but not eliminate, the expo-
sure error. A recent simulation study suggested that correcting 
for exposure measurement error would lead to larger effect 
estimates.59 Third, participants in our study were restricted to 
Medicare beneficiaries with continuous enrollment in both FFS 
program and Part A and B, which may limit generalizability 
to the total elderly population. Fourth, restricting the analysis 
to only beneficiaries who were cancer-free for the initial 10 
years of follow-up may introduce selection bias, considering 
the demographic differences between the analysis group and 
excluded group. There was a possibility that the beneficiaries 
who developed cancer during the initial 10 years might be 
more susceptible to the effects of air pollution. In this case, 
overlooking those beneficiaries could lead to the associations 
being underestimated.
Conclusions
Our study of the national Medicare cohort investigated addi-
tive associations of 10-year exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 with 
the risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial can-
cers. We found that exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were associ-
ated with increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers, 
but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2 
was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, while the 
association for PM2.5 remained inconclusive. At lower exposure 
levels, in particular below the newly updated WHO AQG, we 
observed substantially larger associations between most expo-
sures and the risks of all cancers. The observed additive asso-
ciations resulted in a substantial number of newly diagnosed 
cancer cases per year within the cohorts, ranging from hundreds 
to thousands for each unit increase in exposure. These findings 
suggested substantial cancer burden associated with exposures 
to PM2.5 and NO2, emphasizing the urgent need for strategies to 
mitigate air pollution levels.
