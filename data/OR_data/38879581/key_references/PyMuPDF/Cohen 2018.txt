Abstract
Background: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) is considered to have a carcinogenic effect. The authors
previously reported a nonsignificant association between TRAP and cancer risk in a relatively small cohort of myocardial
infarction survivors. This study assessed whether TRAP exposure is associated with subsequent cancer in a large cohort
of coronary patients.
Methods & results: Consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions in a major medical centre
in central Israel from 2004 to 2014 were followed for cancer through 2015. Residential levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) –
a proxy for TRAP – were estimated based on a high-resolution national land use regression model. Cox proportional
hazards models were constructed to study relationships with cancer. Among 12,784 candidate patients, 9816 had
available exposure data and no history of cancer (mean age, 68 years; 77% men). During a median (25th–75th percentiles)
follow-up of 7.0 (3.9–9.3) years, 773 incident cases of cancer (8%) were diagnosed. In a multivariable-adjusted model, a
10-ppb increase in mean NOx exposure was associated with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]
1.00–1.15) for all-site cancer and 1.16 (95% CI 1.05–1.28) for cancers previously linked to TRAP (lung, breast, prostate,
kidney and bladder). A stronger association was observed for breast cancer (HR ¼ 1.43; 95% CI 1.12–1.83). Associations
were slightly strengthened after limiting the cohort to patients with more precise exposure assessment.
Conclusion: Coronary patients exposed to TRAP are at increased risk of several types of cancer, particularly lung,
prostate and breast. As these cancers are amenable to prevention strategies, identifying highly exposed patients may
provide an opportunity to improve clinical care.

Introduction
Evidence suggests higher incidence rates of cancer
among individuals with cardiovascular disease com-
pared to those without.1–4 Both short- and long-term
increased cancer risk following a cardiovascular disease
manifestation were reported,3 implying that factors
other than surveillance bias and case ﬁnding may play
a role in the observed association, including environ-
mental pollutants.5
One major environmental pollutant that is recognised
by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) as a Group 1 carcinogen is traﬃc-related air
pollution (TRAP).6 Epidemiological evidence suggests
that chronic exposure to TRAP is associated with
increased risk of several types of cancer, principally
cancer of the lung,7 breast8,9 and prostate,10,11 with a
few reports on urinary bladder12 and kidney cancers.13
Nevertheless, uncertainty still remains regarding the
strength of these associations, particularly among indi-
viduals with high susceptibility to environmental expos-
ures. According to 2016 European guidelines on
cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice,
subjects with a high cardiovascular risk are considered
more prone to the detrimental eﬀects of air pollution.14
Along with this, studies among cardiovascular patients
focused on TRAP-associated mortality,15,16 recurrent
cardiovascular events15,17 as well as the frailty syn-
drome.18,19 However, cancer-related outcomes were
not previously investigated in this population. This
gap in knowledge led us to investigate the relationship
between TRAP and incident cancer among patients with
coronary artery disease. In a previous investigation, we
observed a positive nonsigniﬁcant association between
chronic exposure to TRAP and risk of cancer in a rela-
tively small cohort of ﬁrst myocardial infarction sur-
vivors followed-up for more than two decades.20
However, power limitations prevented us from analys-
ing speciﬁc cancers separately. Furthermore, the small
number of women in that cohort precluded us from
assessing breast cancer. In the present study, we assessed
the association between TRAP and cancer in a much
larger cohort of consecutive patients undergoing percu-
taneous coronary interventions (PCIs) in a large medical
centre in central Israel, utilising its size and comprehen-
sive clinical information to further investigate the asso-
ciation with various cancer types.
Methods
Study population
This study is designed as a historical prospective study
comprising
all
consecutive
patients
(n ¼ 12,784)
undergoing PCI at the cardiology department of
Rabin
Medical
Center
(Beilinson
and
Hasharon
Hospitals)
in
central
Israel
from
April
2004
to
October 2014. Patients with a prior cancer diagnosis
at baseline were excluded from the study. As previously
described,21 data were retrieved from multiple data
sources: clinical and laboratory data were extracted
from the patients’ electronic medical records; demo-
graphic data, including information on residential
addresses, and mortality data were obtained from the
Israeli Ministry of the Interior and the Clalit Health
Organization data warehouse. The accuracy of mortal-
ity data was veriﬁed with the Israel Central Bureau of
Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Neighbourhood
socioeconomic status (nSES) was estimated through a
20-point scale index developed by the Israel Central
Bureau of Statistics, based on the 2008 National
Census, with a score of 20 representing the highest
nSES.22 All aspects of the study were approved by the
appropriate institutional ethics committees.
Cancer incidence
Members of the cohort were linked to the Israeli
National Cancer Registry (INCR) via their national
identiﬁcation numbers. The INCR has been in oper-
ation since 1961; reporting of cancer cases by medical
facilities and pathology laboratories to the INCR has
been mandatory since 1982, and therefore covers the
entire Israeli population (approximately 8.5 million in
2016),23 with 94% estimated completeness of ascertain-
ment for solid tumors.24 Data supplied by the INCR
included date of diagnosis and diagnostic code assigned
according
to
the
International
Classiﬁcation
of
Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O), 3rd edition, regarding
primary cancers only (i.e. not metastases). Using the
INCR linkage, we classiﬁed incident cases of cancers
of all sites (ICD-O codes: C00.0–C80.9). We also iden-
tiﬁed other cancer sites, particularly those suggested
to be related to chronic exposure to TRAP, including
cancers of the bronchus and the lung (C34.0–C34.9),
breast (C50), prostate gland (C61.9), kidney (C64.9)
and bladder (C67.9). Patients not diagnosed with
cancer were right-censored at the date of death or last
date of cancer update (July 2015).
Exposure assessment
Serving as an indicator of individual chronic exposure
to TRAP, residential NOx levels were estimated by a
high-resolution national land use regression (LUR)
model, using a 20-year-long record of air quality moni-
toring data in Israel.25 In brief, ambient air pollution
measurements in Israel are routinely performed by
the

Air
Quality
Monitoring

several municipal associations for environmental pro-
tection and the Israel Electric Corporation, together
including over 100 monitoring stations. Only sites
with more than 75% data availability for a speciﬁc
year were included in the analysis, comprising 765
annual averages from 104 sites. Geo-location, including
latitude, longitude, elevation above sea level and air
sample inlet elevation above street level, was collected
for each monitoring site. Spatial variables were gener-
ated through development and reconstruction of geo-
graphic information system (GIS) data on a national
scale, based on historical 1:50,000 topographic maps
for each decade and satellite imagery.In addition, a
database of annual changes in the traﬃc volume of
Israel’s highways was constructed based on samples
of vehicle counts and the ﬂeet composition of Israel’s
towns and cities from records of the Israel Central
Bureau of Statistics. Altogether, 22 predictors were cal-
culated (in 10 groups), 11 of them were extracted at 28
diﬀerent radii each (buﬀers of 50 to 3000 m around
monitoring station), including road networks (distance
to highways, main and local roads as well as total
length in the buﬀer zone), population density, land
use classiﬁcation, vegetation cover, traﬃc volume (all
calculated within the buﬀer area), vehicle counts and
type of air quality monitoring site (i.e. ‘near-road’ or
‘general’), with the year of measurement as one of the
predictors. These predictors were selected based on a
priori knowledge about their eﬀects on TRAP levels. A
supervised forward stepwise procedure was used to
select the model that would best predict NOx levels
over the entire study domain.26 Due to the national
coverage of the domain and in order to resolve intra-
urban variability, a nested grid approach was adopted,
calculating all predictors at a coarse spatial resolution
of 200 m over the entire domain and a ﬁner resolution
of 50 m over the residential areas only. After calculating
the model’s prediction for each grid, the two grids were
joined into a ﬁnal grid of 50 m. A leave-one-out cross-
validation procedure generated an adjusted R2 of 0.74.
For each study participant, annual estimates of NOx
concentrations were produced for each year between
2004 and 2012, representing TRAP exposure during
the follow-up period, by assigning the exposure sur-
faces derived from the LUR model to the residential
location. Since spatial distributions of NOx did not
change appreciably over the years, with very high cor-
relations (Pearson’s r  0.98) between the annual esti-
mates, we considered the mean NOx exposure between
2004 and 2012.
Statistical analyses
Diﬀerences in baseline characteristics across NOx
exposure tertiles were examined using the 2 test for
trend (categorical variables) or general linear models
(continuous
variables).
Cox
proportional
hazards
models27 were constructed to estimate the associations
between TRAP and cancer, with age serving as the time
scale.28 We examined associations of NOx exposure
with all-site cancer incidence as well as with site-speciﬁc
cancers previously linked to vehicular traﬃc exposure,
speciﬁcally cancers of the lung,7 breast,9 prostate,11
kidney13 and bladder.12 These cancers were analysed
together as a pooled outcome,20 as well as individually.
We also attempted to assess the speciﬁcity of the
association between TRAP and the above cancers by
examining other cancer categories that were not previ-
ously described in the air pollution context, including
cancer of the digestive organs, haematopoietic and
reticuloendothelial systems and melanoma. The hetero-
geneity in the association with diﬀerent cancer groups
was formally tested.29 For all cancer outcomes, a crude
analysis was initially conducted (with age serving as the
time scale and therefore not being adjusted for).
Subsequently,
multivariable
adjustment
was
per-
formed, accounting for sociodemographic and clinical
characteristics
at
the
index PCI.
Predictors were
selected based on a priori knowledge if they were: (a)
well-established cancer risk factors (including sex,
smoking status and Arab/Jewish ethnicity30); (b) vari-
ables previously shown to be associated both with
TRAP exposure as well as cancer incidence (including
nSES,31,32 diabetes mellitus,33,34 chronic heart fail-
ure1,35 and haemoglobin levels36,37); and (c) other clin-
ical variables previously shown to have a prognostic
importance in our cohort (including hypertension and
renal failure).21 The proportional hazards assumption
was tested through the Schoenfeld residuals, and was
met in all models. Missing values did not exceed 1% in
any of the variables considered in the analysis except
for nSES (14%). Two approaches were used to deal
with nSES missing values. First, a complete case ana-
lysis was performed (n ¼ 8405). Second, a separate ana-
lysis was conducted, with nSES deﬁned as a categorical
variable (according to tertiles), with missing values
coded
as
an
additional
category.
Because
both
approaches yielded similar results, only the complete
case analysis is presented.
In order to assess the robustness of the TRAP–
cancer association, a series of sensitivity analyses was
performed. First, we repeated the main analysis includ-
ing only subjects whose residential location was identi-
ﬁed on the most accurate level (i.e. geocoded based on
their household number, n ¼ 8849). Second, based on
the association between NOx and cancer observed in
the main analysis, a nonlinear relationship was tested.
Applying spline methodology, a penalised spline term
was used to assess the relationship between NOx and
cancer risk in a Cox regression model. Due to the
Cohen et al.
3

asymmetric distribution of NOx estimates in our cohort
(right skewed), we performed an additional analysis
using the natural logarithm of NOx as the exposure
variable, thus comparing cancer risk associated with a
1-SD increment of NOx in the logarithmic scale and in
the original scale. Analyses were performed using R
statistical software, version 3.4.1 (R Development
Core Team) and IBM SPSS Statistics, version 23
(IBM SPSS, Inc.).
Results
Between 2004 and 2014, 12,784 patients underwent PCI
at the Rabin Medical Center. Of those, 1395 (11%)
who had a diagnosis of cancer before study entry and
55 who were non-Israeli residents were excluded from
the study. Assessment of NOx exposure was available
for 9816 (87%) study participants. Among the 1518
patients without exposure data, 649 had incomplete
information on residential location and 869 did not
reside
within
the
model
computational
domain
(Figure 1).25
Table 1 shows the pertinent clinical characteristics of
the cohort. Mean (SD) age was 68 (12) years, 77% were
men and 35% reported smoking. Most participants
(81%) had comorbid conditions, including hyperten-
sion, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, stroke, dementia
or chronic heart failure. Mean (range) NOx exposure
during the follow-up period as predicted by the LUR
model was 19.5 (2.4–79.7) ppb (Figure 2). NOx expos-
ure was only minimally associated with baseline clinical
characteristics (Table 1).
The median follow-up period (among censored
subjects)
was
7.0
years
(25th–75th
percentiles,
3.9–9.3 years). During this period, 773 new cases of
cancer (8%) were diagnosed, of which more than half
were attributed to cancers previously linked to TRAP
exposure, speciﬁcally cancer of the lung (13%), breast
(6%), prostate (16%), kidney (4%) and bladder (10%)
(Figure 3).
Cox proportional hazards models yielded a hazard
ratio (HR) of 1.07 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 1.00–
1.15) for all-site cancer for a 10-ppb increase in NOx
exposure, after adjustment for sociodemographic and
clinical factors; no eﬀect modiﬁcations were observed
for
age,
nSES
and
pre-existing
comorbidity
(all
p  0.10). Examining the association between NOx
exposure and speciﬁc cancers previously linked to
TRAP as a combined end-point yielded a HR of
1.16 (95% CI 1.05–1.28) for cancer of the lung,
breast, prostate, kidney or bladder. Analysed individu-
ally, a stronger association was shown for breast cancer
(adjusted HR ¼ 1.43; 95% CI 1.12–1.83). A sensitivity
analysis excluding patients with residential locations
identiﬁed on a coarse resolution resulted in slightly
stronger
associations
for
most
cancer
outcomes.

For example, the association between TRAP and pros-
tate cancer in the full cohort (adjusted HR ¼ 1.16; 95%
CI 0.99–1.37) was strengthened among subjects with
more
precise
exposure
assessment
(adjusted
HR ¼ 1.20; 95% CI 1.02–1.42) (Table 2).
Applying spline methodology, a nonlinear relation-
ship between NOx (on a continuous scale) and com-
bined cancer of the lung, breast, prostate, kidney or
bladder was seen; as NOx levels increased, the risk of
these cancers increased exponentially. No evidence for
a nonlinear relationship was shown for all-site cancer
risk (Figure 4).
Assessing the association between TRAP and other
cancer sites (not previously linked to air pollution
exposure) showed weaker or no association, thus sup-
porting a speciﬁc association with lung, prostate and
breast cancers (p for heterogeneity ¼ 0.085) (Figure 5).
Additionally, modelling NOx on a logarithmic scale
yielded similar associations with all-site and site-speciﬁc
cancer risk.
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study of 10,000 patients
undergoing PCI at a large medical centre in Israel
and subsequently followed up for cancer over a
median duration of 7 years, chronic exposure to vehicu-
lar traﬃc, as indicated by residential NOx levels, was
positively associated with all-site cancer incidence.
Furthermore, a stronger association was observed for
speciﬁc cancers previously linked to TRAP, particularly
cancer of the lung, prostate and breast, with weaker or
no association for other cancer sites. The associations
were not sensitive to adjustment for various individual
measures and several sensitivity analyses that were per-
formed. In addition, when restricting the cohort to
patients with more precise exposure assessment, these
associations were slightly strengthened. Notably, mod-
elling NOx on a continuous scale yielded a nonlinear
relationship between NOx and cancer of the lung,
breast, prostate, kidney or bladder combined.
In our previous investigation, a positive yet non-
signiﬁcant association was observed between chronic
exposure to TRAP and risk of cancer in a relatively
small cohort of ﬁrst myocardial infarction survivors.20
A positive association was seen for all-site cancer
(adjusted HR ¼ 1.06; 95% CI 0.96–1.18) that was
stronger for cancer of the lung, prostate, kidney or
bladder (adjusted HR ¼ 1.16; 95% CI 1.00–1.33).
Power limitations prevented us from analysing these

speciﬁc cancers separately, and the small number of
women in the cohort precluded us from assessing
breast cancer. Addressing these issues in the current
study, we were able to show statistically signiﬁcant
associations for all-site and TRAP-related cancers and
to reveal a substantial association with breast cancer.
Studies investigating the health eﬀects of chronic
exposure to TRAP among patients with established
coronary
disease
generally
focused
on
TRAP-
associated
mortality,38,39
recurrent
cardiovascular
events15,17 and also the frailty syndrome.18,19 TRAP-
associated cancer risk had not yet been explored in
this patient group, although growing evidence shows
an excess risk of cancer among patients with established
cardiovascular disease, including heart failure,1,2 myo-
cardial infarction3 and other disease manifestations.4
Yet the mechanism behind the association remains lar-
gely unknown. A possible detection bias is one of the
suggested explanations,40 due to intensive follow-up
accompanying the management of the disease, which
may lead to earlier detection of occult cancer. Since
most of the increased health demands of cardiovascular
patients occur during the ﬁrst year of diagnosis,41
increased cancer diagnosis is expected in that time inter-
val. However, the observed lag time of 1.5 years2 and
3 years3 between cardiovascular disease and cancer
diagnoses reported previously and the ﬁndings of our
study argue against detection bias as a major explan-
ation in this setting. Shared risk factors are also sug-
gested to play a role in the observed increased cancer
risk
among cardiovascular
patients.4
Nevertheless,
adjustment for well-established risk factors, such as
smoking, obesity and physical activity, did not inﬂu-
ence the relationship between myocardial infarction
and cancer,3 suggesting that other factors may be
responsible for the observed association, including
environmental exposures.5
Environmental pollutants were previously shown to
have a carcinogenic eﬀect in the population in general
and in highly susceptible subgroups in particular.42,43

by the IRAC,44 yet evidence regarding the magnitude of
the association between TRAP and cancer is not con-
sistent across the epidemiological literature. To our
knowledge, only one study evaluated the association
between ambient air pollution and all-site cancer
mortality.45 In this study, exposure to particulate
matter was positively associated with increased risk
of
all-site
cancer
mortality
(HR ¼ 1.22;
95%
CI
1.11–1.34), which is stronger than the association
observed
in
our
cohort
(HR ¼ 1.07;
95%
CI
1.00–1.15). However, cancer mortality – rather than
incidence – served as the primary outcome, so cancer
risk was not assessed directly.
Epidemiological evidence regarding the relationship
between TRAP and speciﬁc cancers is also conﬂicting.
Lung cancer is the primary cancer outcome studied in
this context, since the airways are the primary target
organs of inhaled pollutants.13 In two recently pub-
lished meta-analyses, pooled estimates of the same
magnitude were detected for the NOx–lung cancer rela-
tionship, with a meta-HR of 1.03 (95% CI 1.01–1.05)7
and
a

1.04
(95%

were conducted in the general population. This may
partially explain the slightly lower point estimates com-
pared to those detected in our current investigation of
coronary patients (HR ¼ 1.13 in the full cohort and
HR ¼ 1.18 after limiting the cohort to subjects with
more precise exposure assessment).
The relationship between exposure to diesel exhaust
and the incidence of cancers other than lung was ﬁrst
examined in occupational settings,47 and more recently
in population-based epidemiological studies. Cancers
of the prostate and breast are the most studied cancers
in this context, with growing evidence for a positive
association with TRAP exposure. In a recent case–con-
trol study conducted in Canada, concentrations of
ultraﬁne particles were associated with an increased
risk of prostate cancer (adjusted OR ¼ 1.10; 95%
CI 1.01–1.19).11 In another Canadian case–control
study, a positive association between chronic exposure
to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and prostate cancer was
also
demonstrated
(adjusted
OR ¼ 1.27;
95%
CI
1.03–1.58).10 These ﬁndings are consistent with our cur-
rent ﬁndings, with a HR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.99–1.37) in
the full cohort and a HR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.02–1.42)
after limiting the cohort to subjects with more precise
exposure assessment.
In our study, we observed a relatively strong associ-
ation between TRAP and breast cancer (HR ¼ 1.43;
95% CI 1.12–1.83). An association of the same mag-
nitude was recently observed in a case–control study
conducted in the USA using estimates of polycyclic
aromatic
hydrocarbons,
which
are
environmental
pollutants known to be mainly attributed to vehicular
traﬃc.9 The authors reported a positive association
between breast cancer and long-term vehicular traﬃc
estimates in the top 5% exposure compared with
below the median (OR ¼ 1.44; 95% CI 0.78–2.68).
A
positive
association
was
also
observed
in
another case–control study conducted in Canada,
with an OR of 1.32 (95% CI 1.05–1.67) for premeno-
pausal breast cancer associated with NO2 exposure.8
However, other epidemiological studies have shown
weaker48 or no associations49,50 between TRAP and
breast cancer risk.

Methodological considerations
The large-scale and well-deﬁned cohort of coronary
patients utilised in the current investigation is an
important strength of our study. The size of the
cohort enabled us to conduct site-speciﬁc analyses.
Data on cancer diagnosis and mortality were ascer-
tained through multiple national databases with high
completeness of case ascertainment.24 NOx levels were
estimated by a comprehensive LUR model with a
national coverage and high spatial resolution, thus
being suitable for assessing chronic TRAP exposure.
However, in this context, the main concern of our
study – similar to other studies on air pollution health
eﬀects – is exposure misclassiﬁcation. Lack of informa-
tion on other locations frequently visited besides home
address, as well as data on participants’ activity pat-
terns, leaves uncertainty whether the modelled exposure
correctly estimates the true inter-participant expos-
ure variability.51 In spite of this limitation, our expos-
ure
assessment
has
several
strengths.
First,
NOx
estimates produced by the LUR model are obtained
on a very high-resolution (50-m) grid (see map in
Figure 2), enabling us to detect small-scale variability
in pollutant levels that is mainly attributed to local
sources in urban settings.52 Second, seeking to reduce
the uncertainty of exposure estimates, we performed a
sensitivity analysis in which we restricted our cohort
only to subjects with the most reﬁned resolution expos-
ure assessment. In this analysis, higher point estimates
were observed for all cancer outcomes, implying a
stronger association attributed to more precise expos-
ure estimates. Third, NOx levels served as an indicator
for TRAP exposure in our study. Due to the high cor-
relation between NOx and other combustion by-pro-
ducts – many of which are known carcinogens – NOx
is considered the best indicator for TRAP exposure.7,53
As annual NOx levels were averaged only over the
follow-up period, one may claim that the latency
period was not taken into consideration, thus question-
ing the temporality of the association. However, the
very high correlation between annual estimates allowed
us to assume consistent distinction between subjects
with high versus low levels of NOx exposure through-
out the years, including those preceding the index PCI.
Nevertheless, not taking into account residential his-
tory, as well as occupational exposures, may constitute
a bias in this context. In addition, as with many studies
of this nature, although accounting for abundant indi-
vidual clinical and sociodemographic characteristics,
including nSES – an important confounder in the
TRAP–health relationship54 – there is still a concern
regarding residual confounding.
Potential implications
Our ﬁndings are consistent with our previous report of
an elevated cancer risk associated with chronic residen-
tial
exposure
to
traﬃc-sourced
air
pollution.
Associations
of
almost
identical
magnitude
were
observed in the two distinct cohorts of coronary
patients for both all-site cancer and pooled speciﬁc can-
cers previously shown to be related to TRAP. In the
current study, these associations were shown to be
statistically signiﬁcant and of greater precision, as evi-
dent by the much narrower CIs. The strength of the
associations for speciﬁc cancers was further examined,
revealing stronger associations for cancer of the lung,

prostate and breast. Adjusting for potential confoun-
ders and performing several sensitivity analyses had
almost no eﬀect on the estimated HRs. Compared to
the associations reported in studies conducted in the
general population, the associations observed herein
are slightly stronger, thereby supporting the hypothesis
of higher susceptibility of coronary patients to TRAP
exposure. As multi-morbidity among individuals with
cardiovascular disease
is a subject of substantial
importance, preventive measures are being intensively
taken by clinicians.1 Along with previous recommenda-
tions for recognising air pollution as a major modiﬁable
risk factor in the primary and secondary prevention of
cardiovascular disease,14,55 our results highlight the
need to increase the awareness of both clinicians and
patients regarding other harmful exposures besides the
established cancer risk factors that may also have a
hazardous eﬀect in this population. Furthermore, as
the two cancer types mostly associated with TRAP
exposure – breast and prostate cancers – are those for
whom eﬀective screening and early detection measures
are
available,
the
ﬁndings
of
this
study
have
considerable clinical relevance. Identifying patients at
increased TRAP-related risk for breast/prostate cancer
can result in intensifying the screening strategy (earlier
initiation of mammography/prostate-speciﬁc antigen
test) in an attempt to increase the probability of earlier
detection and subsequently improved prognosis.
Conclusion
This cohort study supports the notion that chronic
exposure to TRAP constitutes a risk factor for cancer
incidence among coronary patients, particularly cancer
of the lung, prostate and breast. As these cancers are
amenable to prevention strategies, identifying highly
exposed patients may provide an opportunity for
improve clinical care.
