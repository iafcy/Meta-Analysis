This study investigates the urban-rural and sex differences in the increased risks of the ten most com-
mon cancers in China related to high PM2.5 concentration in the southeastern side of Hu line. Pearson
correlation coefﬁcient is estimated to reveal how the cancers closely associated with PM2.5 long-term
exposure. Then linear regression is conducted to evaluate sex- and area-speciﬁc increased risks of
those cancers from high level PM2.5 long-term exposure. The major ﬁnding is with the increase of every
10 mg/m3 of annual mean PM2.5 concentration, the increase of relative risks for lung cancer incidence and
mortality are 15% and 23% for males, and 22% and 24% for females in rural area. For urban area, the
increase of relative risk for ovarian cancer incidence is 9% for females, while that for prostatic cancer
increases 17% for males. For leukemia, the increase of relative risks for incidence and mortality are 22%
and 19% for females in rural area, while in urban area the increase of relative risk for mortality is 9% for
males and for incidence is 6% for females. It is also found that with increased PM2.5 exposure, the risks for
ovarian and prostatic cancer rise signiﬁcantly in urban area, while risks for lung cancer and leukemia rise
signiﬁcantly in rural area. The results demonstrate the higher risks for lung cancer and leukemia with
increased PM2.5 exposure are more signiﬁcant for female. This study also suggests that the carcinogenic
effects of PM2.5 have obvious sex and urban-rural differences.

1. Introduction
The threat to the public health caused by the exposure to ﬁne
particulate matter and air pollution has attracted more and more
attentions from the public, governments and health organizations
worldwide (Pope et al., 1995; Katsouyanni et al., 2001; Yim and
Barrett, 2012). Recent studies show that air pollution has become
a major global health risk factor (Gu et al., 2018; Forouzanfar et al.,
2016; Cohen et al., 2004; Oliveri Conti et al., 2017), particulate
matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mm (PM2.5)
shortens life expectancy due to its health impact on morbidity and
mortality (Mazzi et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2014; Samet et al., 2000),
especially for lung cancer (Dehghani et al., 2017; MacNaughton
et al., 2017) and cardiovascular diseases (Gurgueira et al., 2002;
Zhang et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2014). Cohen et al. (2017) indicated
that 4.2 million deaths in 2015 were caused by the exposure to
PM2.5, and more than 1.1 million deaths were in China. WHO issued
a PM2.5 guideline value of annual mean 10 mg/m3, and interim tar-
gets (IT) level 1, 2 and 3 of 35, 25 and 15 mg/m3. At IT-1 level, a 15%
higher long-term mortality risk is reported relative to the guideline
level (World Health Organization, 2006). However, IT-1 level is not
achieved at most of the areas of China, and population-weighted
mean of PM2.5 concentration in Chinese cities were 61 mg/m3 at
the year of 2013 (Huang et al., 2014; Zhang and Cao, 2015).
Therefore, the health impact caused by PM2.5 exposure has become
an urgent issue in China (Hu and Jiang, 2014; Li and Gao, 2014; Pui
et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016, 2017).
The studies in the developed areas revealed that air pollution
caused by PM2.5 was a serious threat to human health in various
aspects,
i.e.
its
enhancement
of
cardiopulmonary
diseases
(Yoshinaga et al., 2018; Ali et al., 2017; Wong et al., 2008; Pope et al.,
2009; Oh et al., 2011; Madrigano et al., 2013; Cesaroni et al., 2014),
premature birth and low birth weight (Han et al., 2018; Brauer et al.,
2008; Aguilera et al., 2009; Kloog et al., 2012), and systemic dis-
eases (O'Neill et al., 2005; Dubowsky et al., 2006; Zeka et al., 2006;
Pope et al., 2016). In China, many studies showed that short-term
exposure of PM2.5 was also associated with the rise of hospital
emergency-room visits, cardio-respiratory diseases and mortality
in city areas (Chen et al., 2018; Guo et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Chen
et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2012;
Lu. et al., 2015; Qiao et al., 2014); while cohort studies show that
ambient particulate matter can increase the risks of total, cardio-
vascular and respiratory mortality (Dong et al., 2012; Zhou et al.,
2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Guo et al., 2016).
There are two main causes of these health hazards: one is that the
ﬁne particles in PM2.5 are small enough to arrive a large part of
human organs (including the respiratory system, the circulatory
system, and the reproductive system), and another is that there are
numerous kinds of hazardous substances in the PM2.5, i.e. carci-
nogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals
(such as lead, mercury, chromium and cadmium), and pathogenic
microorganisms (such as bacteria, viruses and fungi) (Lee et al.,
2007; Cao et al., 2014; Zhai et al., 2014). PAHs in PM2.5 are sus-
pected to be a predisposing factor of breast cancer because of its
disruption of BRCA-1 gene expression in estrogen receptor (Jeffy
et al., 2002). Parikh et al. (Parikh and Wei, 2016) also conclude
that PAHs in PM2.5 have a signiﬁcant impact on the increased
incidence of female breast cancer in urban areas. Further, BRCA-1
has been conﬁrmed to be associated with ovarian cancer (Chen
and Parmigiani, 2007). Therefore, it could be deduced that cancer
is a manifestation of the health effects of PM2.5 in the regions with
large population density, since PAHs can almost always be detected
in PM2.5 in these regions (Yang et al., 2011).
The PM2.5 concentration in China has been at the elevated level
for a long time and the main hazardous substances in PM2.5 such as
PAHs and heavy metals have also been identiﬁed to have impacts
on increased risks for some common disease (Martin et al., 2017;
Leontief and Ford, 1971; Contoyannis and Jones, 2004; Huang
et al., 2011). Thus, a screen on all most common disease is con-
ducted in this study to understand the health effects of PM2.5
exposure in China. Moreover, we need to consider the geographical
and sex factors, because there are spatial differences in the PM2.5
concentration and compositions (mainly between urban and rural
area) as well as sex differences in the sensitivity to toxic substances.
To assess the health effects caused by PM2.5 in China, ﬁrstly, we
need to ﬁnd out which cancers closely associated with high PM2.5
concentration; and then, we need to evaluate sex- and area-speciﬁc
increased risks of those cancers from high level PM2.5 long-term
exposure.
In this study, we ﬁrst investigated the association between the
ten most common cancers in China (identiﬁed by the National
Central Cancer Registry of China) incidence and mortality with
PM2.5 concentration to ﬁnd out which cancers are closely relative to
PM2.5 by using the time series data of yearly incidence and mor-
tality of the ten most common cancers and the annual mean PM2.5
concentration in China from 2000 to 2011. Secondly, we estimated
the sex- and area-speciﬁc increased cancer incidence/mortality
risks from long-term exposure to high PM2.5 concentration by using
spatiotemporal series data of the southeastern side of Hu line from
2006 to 2009. Finally, we studied the urban-rural and sex differ-
ences in the increased risks of incidence and mortality for the ten
most common cancers from long-term exposure to high PM2.5
concentration. The southeastern side of Hu line (Hu, 1990) was
selected as our research region, because this part of China has larger
population density and more developed social economic level,
which mean the air pollution caused by PM2.5 is very serious and
the data collected are also more consistent with the actual
situation.
2. Materials and methods
The data collection method and statistical method were pre-
sented in section 2.1 and section 2.2, respectively.
2.1. Data
Cancer incidence and mortality data as well as gridded PM2.5
concentrations and population data could be collected according to
the following methods.
2.1.1. Cancer incidence and mortality data
The data used in this paper are:
1) Cancer statistics reported in the work of Chen et al. (Dong et al.,
2012). This is a time series dataset spanning from 2000 to 2011.
It consists of cancer incident and mortality of 22 registries
covering 44.4 million population. This dataset was employed to
conduct Pearson correlation coefﬁcient analysis to investigate
the relationship between cancer incidence and mortality and
PM2.5 exposure.
2) Chinese cancer registry annual report (2009e2012) issued by
the National Central Cancer Registry of China (NCCR). Data
collected from the report spanning from 2006 to 2009. This is a
spatiotemporal series dataset containing cancer incident and
mortality data reported from 34 local population-based cancer
registries located in the area southeast of Hu line known as an
area with greater population density and more developed
economy (as presented in Fig. 1). The total 34 cancer registries
including 16 and 18 sites for urban and rural areas respectively.
This dataset was used to perform linear regression to estimate
H. Wang et al. / Chemosphere 216 (2019) 766e773
767

the area-speciﬁc and sex-speciﬁc increased risks of cancer
incidence and mortality from long-term exposure to high PM2.5
concentration.
Both of the two datasets used in this study were validated by
NCCR based on the Guidelines for Chinese Cancer Registration and
International Agency for Research on Cancer/International Associ-
ation of Cancer Registries (IARC/IACR) data-quality criteria.
2.1.2. Gridded PM2.5 concentrations, population and per capita GDP
data
The ambient PM2.5 measurements in China were not available
until 2012, thus PM2.5 concentration was estimated from AOD as an
alternative. The 0.1  0.1 gridded annual mean PM2.5 concentra-
tions for the period of 2000e2011 were obtained from Atmospheric
Composition
Analysis
Group
(http://ﬁzz.phys.dal.ca/~atmos/
martin/?page_id¼140). The area covered by each grid is approxi-
mately equal to the area covered by a cancer registration site.
Therefore a corresponding gridded PM2.5 concentration can be
associated with each cancer registry.
The permanent resident population data for each cancer registry
were obtained from the 5th and 6th national population census
conducted in 2000 and 2010, respectively. The population were
then linearly interpolated and extrapolated to the whole period of
2000e2011.
The annual per capita GDP data are obtained from National
Bureau of Statistics of China (http://data.stats.gov.cn/easyquery.
htm?cn¼C01).
2.2. Statistical methods
2.2.1. The exposure level of PM2.5
For each cancer registry, the population-weighted annual mean
PM2.5 exposure concentration could be calculated by Eq. (1):
PWEL ¼
X
ðPi  CiÞ
. X
Pi
(1)
where
PWEL
(population-weighted
exposure
level)
is
the
population-weighted mean PM2.5 exposure concentration (mg/m3),
and Pi and Ci are the population (10 thousands) and PM2.5 con-
centration (mg/m3) at each grid of the cancer registration site,
respectively.
2.2.2. The association analysis of the time series dataset
In order to ﬁnd out which cancers are closely associated with
PM2.5 long-term exposure, the correlation between cancers inci-
dence (and mortality) and the population-weighted PM2.5 exposure
concentration were evaluated. As a comparison, the correlation
between cancers incidence (and mortality) and per capita GDP
were also calculated. Therefore, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients
(R) between the time series of population-weighted annual mean
PM2.5 concentration (or per capita GDP) and incidence (or mortal-
ity) for the ten most common cancers were calculated and used to
determine whether or not the two are related by comparing with
the critical value of R when p < 0.05. R can be determined by Eq. (2):
R ¼

(or per capita GDP) of the ith year, respectively. X ¼ Pn

2.2.3. The regression analysis of the spatiotemporal series dataset
The spatiotemporal series data were derived from 34 cancer
registries (including 16 urban sites and 18 rural sites) over a 4-year
period, and a sample of 136 (including 64 for urban sites and 72 for
rural sites) PM2.5-cancer incidence (and PM2.5-cancer mortality)
data were obtained. All the annual data at each of sites were ﬁrstly
categorized at a bin of 5 mg/m3 population-weighted annual mean
PM2.5 concentration, and then bin-averaged incidence, mortality
and population-weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentration were
calculated. With the bin-averaged data, linear regression was per-
formed to reveal the relation between incidence/mortality of the
ten most common cancers and population-weighted annual mean
PM2.5 concentration, then to obtain the increased risks of cancers
incidence
and
mortality
with
every
10 mg/m3
increment
of
population-weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentration. Accord-
ingly, the errors can be reduced and the regression precision can be
improved by using the average values of PM2.5 exposure level,
cancer incidence and mortality in each bin instead of original ones.
3. Results and discussion
The results of this study were ﬁrstly presented in this section,
then, the results were discussed in details.

(and mortality) of the ten most common cancers during 2000e2011

of

dence (and mortality) of the ten most common cancers for both
males and females were presented in Fig. 2. The parameter-per
capita GDP was added as a contrast, because economy is an
important interference factor which can not only contribute to

line, which marks a drastic difference in the distribution of China's population. The

environmental deterioration but also the public health condition. In
fact, studies have reported that some high cancers incidence were
stimulated by the economic development (Lee et al., 2007), and two
main reasons were speculated: ﬁrstly, environmental degradation
usually follows with economic development (Cao et al., 2014), the
results in this study also validated this (RPM2.5-per capita GDP is 0.594,
means the population-weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentration
is positively related with per capita GDP between 2000 and 2011);
secondly, more mature cancer screening methods were applied
with economic development, and advanced methods can diagnose
cancers earlier to reduce the missed diagnosis cases, and ﬁnally
result in increased incidence (Zhai et al., 2014). For example, the
incidence of female thyroid cancer increased year by year may be a
false alarm due to the improvement of medical technology (Jeffy
et al., 2002).
According to Fig. 2, it could be concluded that the incidence of
six cancers in the ten most common cancers are signiﬁcantly pos-
itive associated with population-weighted annual mean PM2.5
concentration and per capita GDP both for male (including prostatic
cancer, leukemia, brain/central nervous system (CNS) cancer,
pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer) and fe-
male (including lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, uter-
ine cancer, ovarian cancer and cervical cancer). On the Contrary,
there are only two cancers whose mortality are signiﬁcantly posi-
tive associated with population-weighted annual mean PM2.5
concentration and per capita GDP, both for male (including leuke-
mia and prostatic cancer) and female (ovarian cancer and cervical
cancer).
Consequently, the negative correlation of cancer-PM2.5/GDP
presented in Fig. 2 can be attributed to the health effects of eco-
nomic development, while the positive correlation was associated
with the environmental deterioration (PM2.5 is one of the most
dangerous pathogenic contaminants) or/and more mature cancer
screening methods.
More concretely, signiﬁcant positive association between cancer
incidence and per capital GDP reveals that there is an increased risk
from environmental deterioration (mainly from PM2.5) and/or more
mature cancer screening methods, while signiﬁcant positive asso-
ciation between cancer mortality and per capital GDP was irrele-
vant to the screening methods. Meanwhile, negative association
shows that there is a decreased risk because of some healthy factors
along with a higher per capital GDP such as a lower smoking rate.
Therefore, the negative association between cancer and PM2.5
should be attributed to the health effects of GDP and the positive
correlation between PM2.5 and GDP. And the positive association
between cancer incidence and PM2.5 were caused by two reasons:
one is that PM2.5 pollution increases the risk of cancer incidence,
and another is that more mature cancer screening methods in-
crease the cancer incidence. Meanwhile, there is only one reason
for the positive association between cancer mortality and PM2.5,
and it is that PM2.5 pollution can increase the risk of cancer
mortality.
A lower smoking rate was one of the most important protector
of health (Chen et al., 2015). According to the work of Research on
National Health Services in Global Adult Tobacco Survey between
1993 and 2010, smoking rates in China are declining (see Table 1),
which is the possible cause of the decreasing incidence of lung
cancer, esophagus cancer, liver cancer and stomach cancer. Mean-
while, Fig. 2 also shows that the incidence and mortality of male
lung cancer were not correlated with PM2.5 concentration, and the
results was inconsistent with literature (Zhang et al., 2014; Li and
Gao, 2014) due to the smoke rate data. The positive correlation
between female lung cancer incidence and population-weighted
annual mean PM2.5 concentration demonstrates the effect of
PM2.5 exposure on lung, while the hazards by PM2.5 exposure to
lung for male have been papered over. A possible explanation is
that the effect of PM2.5 on lung is not noticeable on people with
high smoking rate (male) but signiﬁcant on those with low smoking
rates (female), because smoking is much more harmful compared
with PM2.5 (Yoshinaga et al., 2018).
To summarize, for the ten most common cancers, the incidence
of six cancers and the mortality of two cancers are closely related
with PM2.5 exposure. The involved organs include cardiovascular
system, respiratory system, reproductive system, digestive system
and hematopoietic system.
3.2. The association between the spatiotemporal series of PM2.5 and
incidence/mortality of the ten most common cancers during
2006e2009
In order to investigate the urban-rural and sex differences of the
health effects of PM2.5 exposure, the association between the
spatiotemporal series of PM2.5 and incidence (and mortality) of the
ten most common cancers during 2006e2009 were analyzed. Ac-
cording to results in section 3.1, cancer incidence was increased
both by PM2.5 pollution and mature screening methods, while
cancer mortality was only increased by PM2.5 pollution, therefore,
Fig. 2. The correlation coefﬁcient (R) between population-weighted annual mean
PM2.5 concentrations (and per capita GDP) and cancer incidence, between population-
weighted annual mean PM2.5 concentrations (and per capita GDP) and cancer mor-
tality for males and females. The R ¼ ± 0.576 lines are also shown in the ﬁgure as
orange dashed lines (when |R| > 0.576, P < 0.05, and the correlation is signiﬁcant). The
cancer with a larger incidence is at a more left position on X-axis. RPM2.5-per capita GDP is
0.594.

in order to exclude the impact of mature screening methods, we
select the cancers whose mortality are signiﬁcantly positive related
with PM2.5 as our study subjects in this section. As a special case,
lung cancer was also analyzed in this section because it is fully
demonstrated to be affected by PM2.5 exposure (Dehghani et al.,
2017).
Table 2 shows the numbers of urban or rural sites that fall into
each of the 5 mg/m3 bins. The annual mean of PM2.5 concentration
at most of the sites falls into the range of 36e60 mg/m3, and only 9%
are below 35 mg/m3 (IT-1 level), 92% of which are from rural area.
Furthermore, there are about 20% of urban areas and 35% of rural
areas with PM2.5 concentration more than 60 mg/m3 respectively,
which means more rural population were exposed to high levels
PM2.5 concentration. It is worth pointing out that the annual mean
PM2.5 concentration was not weighted by population because the
area of 0.1  0.1 grid is almost equal to the area covering by a
cancer registry.
For each kind of cancer, the regression of cancer with urban
male, rural male, urban female and rural female were carried out.
The regression formula was presented in Eq. (3):
y ¼ Bx þ b0
(3)
Where y is cancer incidence or mortality, x is annual mean PM2.5
concentration. All the data need to be preprocessed with the
method stated in section 2.2.3.
According to Table 3, there is not always a linear relationship
between the incidence and mortality of the selected ﬁve cancers
and PM2.5 concentration. For the same cancer, there are signiﬁcant
sex and urban-rural differences in the health effects of PM2.5. And
for different cancers, PM2.5 has different hazards in urban and rural
areas. The regression relationships were employed to identify the
trends and patterns, as presented Fig. 3.
Accordingly, it could be estimated that the increased relative
risks (RRs) of the ﬁve cancers incidence and mortality for every
10 mg/m3
increment
of
annual
mean
PM2.5
concentration,
compared with which is at 35 mg/m3 can be determined according
to Eqs. (4) and (5).
RRI ¼ 10B/I0
(4)
RRM ¼ 10B/M0
(5)
Where RRI and RRM are the increased relative risk for incidence and
mortality respectively, and I0 and M0 are incidence and mortality
when annual mean PM2.5 concentration is at 35 mg/m3 (IT-1 pro-
posed by WHO) respectively,. B is the coefﬁcient of the corre-
sponding formula.
Table 4 shows that, there are obvious urban-rural and male-
female distinctions for the health impact of PM2.5 exposure. More
speciﬁcally, the risks of PM2.5 exposure are higher in urban area for
ovarian cancer and prostatic cancer; while for lung cancer and
leukemia, the risks are higher in rural area. Moreover, the risks of
male lung cancer and cervical cancer in urban decrease along with
every 10 mg/m3 increment of annual mean PM2.5 concentration, and

this should be an erroneous conclusion, since that recent years in
developed areas when annual mean PM2.5 concentration kept
growing, and the declined smoking rate was a dominant factor for
diminished lung cancer; and more advanced medical techniques
inhibited cervical cancer.
More concretely, compared to the situation of 35 mg/m3 annual
mean PM2.5 concentration (IT-1), RRs of lung cancer mortality for
males and females in rural area increases 23% and 24% respectively
with every 10 mg/m3 increase of annual mean PM2.5 concentration,
which is consistent with Turner et al. (2011), and there is almost no
sex difference in lung cancer mortality in rural area. Different from
rural area, the risks of incidence and mortality for male (female)
lung cancer decline (change insigniﬁcantly) with PM2.5 respectively
in urban area, which again suggests that smoking rate decline could
be the dominant factor for lung cancer. The urban and rural dif-
ferences of RRs of incidence and mortality for other cancers are as
following: with every 10 mg/m3 increment of annual mean PM2.5
concentration, the RR of ovarian cancer incidence increases 9% in
urban area, which changes insigniﬁcantly in rural area; the RR of
prostatic cancer incidence increases 17%, which also changes
insigniﬁcantly in rural area; for male leukemia, only the RR of
mortality in rural increase 9%, but for female leukemia, the RRs of
incidence and mortality increase 22% and 19% in rural area
respectively, and in urban area, only the RR of incidence increases
6%, which suggests that the RR of leukemia from PM2.5 exposure is
more signiﬁcant in rural area than urban area, and it is more sig-
niﬁcant for females than males.
4. Conclusions
Particulate matter pollution has become an urgent issue in most
areas in China because that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration
has remained at a high level greater than 35 mg/m3 for a long
period. In this paper we used the data of cancer incidence/mortality
and PM2.5 concentration to carry out a preliminary exploration of
the sex and urban-rural differences in the health effects of PM2.5
pollution in densely populated areas located in the southeastern
side of Hu line of China. Pearson correlation coefﬁcient and linear
regression were performed to analyze the association between
PM2.5 and the incidence (and mortality) of the ten most common
cancers. For the ten most common cancers, the incidence of six
cancers and the mortality of two cancers are closely related with
PM2.5 exposure. The mainly involved organs include cardiovascular
system, respiratory system, reproductive system, digestive system
and hematopoietic system. For the same cancer, there is a big gap in
RRs of PM2.5 long term exposure between urban and rural area, and
between male and female. For different cancers, the hazards of
PM2.5 vary in urban and rural areas. Our results are demonstrated
reliable because of the consistency with Turner et al. (2011).
All in all, PM2.5 long term and high concentration exposure
sharply raises the risks of some cancers in China, meanwhile, the
responses of cancers to PM2.5 are inconsistent in urban and rural
areas, and in different sex. Speciﬁcally, the responses of lung cancer
and leukemia to PM2.5 are more signiﬁcant in rural area, while the
responses of ovarian cancer and prostatic cancer are more signiﬁ-
cant in urban area. In addition, the hazards of PM2.5 on female are
more signiﬁcant. Therefore, urban and rural differences and sex
differences should be taken into account in the management of the
air pollution and the associated health problem.
Our research is the ﬁrst step of differential study of the health
risks of PM2.5 long term and high concentration exposure in urban-
rural areas and different sex, so the interference of some other
factors is not completely excluded and leads to some abnormal
results. A case in point is that the RRs of male lung cancer and
cervical cancer in urban area decrease along with PM2.5 concen-
tration increment, which suggests that there may be other inﬂu-
encing factors leading to the result, such as the declined smoking
rate and more advanced medical techniques. In order to get more
accurate exposure-response relationship between cancers and
long-term PM2.5 exposure, it is necessary to choose typical areas to
carry on large-scale prospective cohort study.
