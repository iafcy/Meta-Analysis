Abstract
Background: Previous studies suggested a carcinogenic effect of exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Recently,
higher rates of cancer incidence were observed among myocardial infarction survivors compared with the general
population. We examined the association between chronic exposure to nitrogen oxides, a proxy measure for traffic-
related air pollution, and cancer incidence and mortality in a cohort of myocardial infarction patients.
Methods: Patients aged 65 years admitted to hospital in central Israel with a first myocardial infarction in 1992–1993
were followed to 2013 for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality. Data on sociodemographic and cancer risk
factors were obtained, including time-varying information on smoking. Using land use regression models, annual averages
of nitrogen oxides during follow-up were estimated individually according to home addresses. Cox proportional hazards
models were constructed to study the relationships with cancer outcomes.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 16 (SD 7) years, 262 incident cancers and 105 cancer deaths were identified among
1393 cancer-free patients at baseline (mean age 54 years; 81% men). In adjusted models, a 10 ppb increase in mean
nitrogen oxide exposure was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96–1.18) for
cancer incidence and HR of 1.08 (95% CI 0.93–1.26) for cancer mortality. The association with lung, bladder, kidney or
prostate cancer (previously linked to air pollution) was stronger (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00–1.33).
Conclusions: Chronic exposure to traffic-related air pollution may constitute an environmental risk factor for cancer
post-myocardial infarction. Variation in the strength of association between specific cancers needs to be explored further.

Background
Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests a car-
cinogenic eﬀect of long-term exposure to traﬃc-related
air pollution (TRAP).1–12 Multiple studies have linked
air pollution exposure to lung cancer incidence2–4,6 and
mortality;5,11 however, associations with other cancers
have also been reported,12 including bladder,7,8 pros-
tate,9 kidney12 and breast.10,13 This evidence supported
the recent classiﬁcation of ambient air pollution and
particulate matter as a group 1 carcinogen by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer.14
Nevertheless, methodological limitations and incon-
sistencies across the literature leave uncertainties about

several key issues. First, while assessment of cancer
incidence and mortality requires long-term observa-
tional studies, few studies have managed to follow
participants
for
an
adequate
duration
(recently
reviewed by Hamra et al.)1 Second, estimating historic
pollution levels is essential for accurate exposure assess-
ment; however, studies often use available data of
limited time periods during follow-up, thus not fully
capturing
past
exposures.2
In
addition,
although
changes in smoking status over time are known to be
associated with health risk, including mortality,15,16
very few studies have accounted for time-varying
information on smoking.4
Recent evidence for higher incidence rates of cancer
among patients with pre-existing cardiovascular dis-
eases compared to the general population has been
reported.17–21 For example, Hasin et al. demonstrated
that patients with heart failure had a 68% higher risk of
developing cancer (hazard ratio (HR) 1.68; 95% conﬁ-
dence interval (CI) 1.13–2.50) adjusted for clinical
characteristics.18 In addition, in recent decades, a shift
in the cause of death after myocardial infarction (MI)
from cardiovascular to non-cardiovascular has been
observed,22
with
cancer
being
a
main
cause
of
death.20,22,23 Previously observed air pollution-induced
health eﬀects among MI survivors, including mortal-
ity,24,25 recurrent cardiovascular events24,26 and frailty
syndrome,27 along with current evidence of increased
risk for cancer in this population, generated our present
hypothesis regarding a possible association between
chronic exposure to TRAP and cancer incidence and
mortality among MI survivors. For this purpose, we
used data from a population-based cohort study of
cancer-free MI patients, with a follow-up exceeding
20 years, and an abundance of time-varying informa-
tion on potential confounders.
Methods
The study cohort
Participants of this study were drawn from the Israel
Study of First Acute Myocardial Infarction, a longitu-
dinal prospective multicentre study,28 comprising all
individuals aged 65 years who were hospitalised for
incident MI between 1992 and 1993 in one of the eight
hospitals in central Israel. Participants are all residents
of central Israel, a well-deﬁned geographical area of
approximately
1500 km2,
which
is
predominantly
urban. Of an initial 1626 patients admitted to hospital,
81 (5%) died during initial hospitalisation, and 24 with-
drew consent after discharge from hospital. Of the
remaining 1521, 35 (2%) had a history of cancer prior
to study entry, and were therefore excluded from the
study.
Geographical
coordinates
of
residential
addresses were identiﬁed for 1393 (94%) patients,
who were included in the study. Demographic, socio-
economic and clinical data were collected at baseline
and follow-up interviews, 5 and 10–13 years after the
MI. Residential addresses were recorded at baseline
and conﬁrmed after 5 years (Figure 1). All aspects of
the study were approved by the appropriate institu-
tional ethics committees.

identiﬁcation numbers. The INCR has been in oper-
ation since 1961; reporting of cancer cases by medical
facilities and pathology laboratories to the INCR has
been mandatory since 1982, and therefore it covers the
entire Israeli population (approximately 8 million).29
Registry staﬀreview cases reported by laboratories
and medical facilities, determine primary site and
morphology, and assign diagnostic codes according to
the
International
Classiﬁcation
of
Diseases
for
Oncology (ICDO), third edition. Data supplied by the
INCR included the diagnostic code and date of diag-
nosis. Using the INCR linkage, we classiﬁed incidence
cases of cancers of all sites (C00.0–C80.9) diagnosed
during the study period. We also identiﬁed speciﬁc can-
cers suggested to be related to chronic exposure to
TRAP,1,7,9,12 including cancers located in the bronchus
and the lung (ICDO codes: C34.0–C34.9), prostate
gland (C61.9), kidney (C64.9) and bladder (C67.9).
We only included primary cancers (i.e. not metastases).
Patients not diagnosed with cancer were right-censored
at the date of death (n ¼ 524) or last date of cancer
update (31 December 2013).
Cancer mortality assessment
Mortality data were retrieved from the nationwide
database of causes of death, managed by the Ministry
of Health. Until the year 1998, causes of death were
coded according to the International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases, 9th Edition (ICD-09), whereas since 1999
they
are
coded
according
to
the
International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10).
Linkage of the cohort participants to the database
enabled us to assess all-cause and cause-speciﬁc mortal-
ity from the date of entry to the study until 14 May
2015 and 31 December 2012, respectively (Figure 1).
Cases of cancer mortality were identiﬁed through
codes 140.0 to 239.9 (ICD-09) until 1998, or C00.0 to
D48.0 (ICD-10) since 1999. We assured all cases of
cancer mortality were also reported as incidence cases
in the INCR data.
Exposure assessment
Exposure to TRAP was estimated using residential
nitrogen oxides (NOx) levels modelled annually for
each participant during the follow-up period by a
land use regression (LUR) model, using a 20-year
long record (19922011) of air quality monitoring
data in Israel.30 Ambient air pollution measurements
in Israel are performed routinely by the National Air
Quality Monitoring Center at the Israel Ministry of
Environmental Protection, several municipal associ-
ations for environmental protection and the Israel
Electric Corporation, together including over 100
monitoring stations. Only sites with more than 75%
data availability for a speciﬁc year were included in
the analysis, comprising 765 annual averages from
104 sites. Geo-location, including latitude, longitude,
elevation above sea level and air sample inlet elevation
above street level were collected for each monitoring
site. Spatial variables were generated through develop-
ment and reconstruction of GIS data on a national
scale, based on historical 1:50,000 topographic maps
for each decade and satellite imagery. In addition, a
database of annual changes in the traﬃc volume of
Israel’s highways was constructed based on samples
of vehicle counts and the ﬂeet composition of Israel’s
towns and cities from records of Israel’s Central Bureau
of Statistics. Altogether, 22 predictors were calculated
(in 10 groups), including: road network, population
density, power plants, land use, vegetation cover, traﬃc
volumes, vehicle count and type of air quality site (i.e.
‘near-road’ or ‘general’), with the year of measurement
as one of the predictors. Our modelling approach was
to ﬁnd the model that will produce the best predicted
NOx levels over the entire study domain while assuring
that the predictors match a priori knowledge about
their eﬀect on TRAP. Therefore, a supervised forward
stepwise procedure was used to select the best model.31
The model’s leave-one-out cross-validation adjusted R2
was 0.74. For each subject, annual estimates of NOx
exposure were created for each year between 1992
and 2011 by linking the exposure surfaces derived
from the LUR model to residential addresses at base-
line and 5 years post MI, thereby accounting for resi-
dential mobility. Since spatial distributions of NOx did
not change appreciably over the follow-up period, with
very high correlations (Pearson’s r  0.97) between the
annual estimates, we assigned for each subject the mean
NOx exposure during the follow-up period.
Additional individual measures
Individual measures were obtained through structured
interviews and review of patients’ medical records at the
study entry and during follow-up; all clinical data were
veriﬁed by a senior cardiologist. The number of cigar-
ettes smoked per day was evaluated at baseline, 5 years
and
10–13
years
after
the
initial
hospitalisation
(categorised as none/up to 20 cigarettes per day/more
than 20 cigarettes per day), as well as the smoking
history for non-smokers at baseline (categorised as
never smoker/former smoker). Additional variables,
considered as potential confounders for the current
analysis, included: individual socioeconomic status
(SES) data (family income relative to the national aver-
age, education and employment status), ethnicity, phys-
ical
activity,
body
mass
index,
self-rated
health,
hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia.

Neighbourhood SES as a potential confounder
A body of evidence indicates that a person’s health may
be inﬂuenced by the socioeconomic characteristics of
the neighbourhood in which he or she lives, over and
above his or her own SES.32 Along with this, neigh-
bourhood SES (nSES) has been recently reported to
be associated with both total and site-speciﬁc cancer
incidence, as well as with total cancer mortality.33
However, it is still unknown which of the neighbour-
hood’s characteristics might explain these observed
associations. A recent analysis from the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis demonstrated negative associ-
ations between NOx and nSES.34 Considering these
relationships of nSES both with cancer and air pollu-
tion, we found it necessary to account for its potential
confounding eﬀect in the current analysis. We esti-
mated nSES through a 20-point scale index developed
by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, based on the
1995 National Census, with a score of 20 representing
the highest SES.35
Statistical analysis
Diﬀerences in baseline characteristics across NOx
exposure groups were examined using the 2 test for
trend
(categorical
variables)
or
generalised
linear
models
(continuous
variables).
Cox
proportional
hazards models36 were constructed to estimate the asso-
ciations between NOx exposure and cancer outcomes,
including all-site cancer incidence and cancer mortality.
In addition, we attempted to examine associations
between
incidence
of
speciﬁc
cancers
previously
suggested to be aﬀected by TRAP, especially diesel
exhaust (lung, prostate, kidney and bladder) and NOx
exposure.1,7,9,12 Due to the limited number of events in
these cancer categories, they were grouped together. We
could not perform a similar analysis for speciﬁc cancer
deaths due to low statistical power. For participants
who changed their residential address, NOx exposure
was modelled as a time-dependent variable, allowing
the assigned exposure to change accordingly. Initial
adjustment
was
made
for
age
(base
model).
Subsequently, the percentage change in the regression
coeﬃcient for a 10-ppb increment in NOx was estimated
after inclusion of individual candidate confounding
variables into the base model, applying a 5% thresh-
old.37,38 Neighbourhood SES, obesity at baseline, eth-
nicity,
history
of
smoking,
and
current
smoking
(modelled as a time-dependent covariate) met the
latter criterion and were included in the ﬁnal model
(multivariable-adjusted model).
Since association between exposure to air pollutants
and health outcomes is suggested to exist mainly among
those who are not chronically exposed to a high
tobacco dose,4,7,11 we sought to examine the expos-
ure–cancer relationships among patients who might
be more vulnerable to air pollution eﬀects. Therefore,
in a subsequent analysis, we identiﬁed patients who
reported smoking more than 20 cigarettes per day in
each assessment (deﬁned as ‘persistent heavy smokers’),
and excluded them from the analysis. Repeating this
analysis for never smokers alone was not possible,
due to the high percentage of current and former smo-
kers in the cohort (73%). The proportional hazards
assumption was tested with the Schoenfeld residuals,
with no violations detected. Missing values for family
income (17%) and nSES (6%) were imputed using mul-
tiple imputation methodology.39 The Markov Chain
Monte Carlo method was used for this purpose. Five
datasets were created, with missing values replaced by
imputed values based on models incorporating demo-
graphic, socioeconomic, psychosocial and clinical vari-
ables. The results from analysing these datasets were
then combined using Rubin’s rules.39 A complete-case
analysis was subsequently performed, in order to ensure
the robustness of the multiple imputation results.
Because both approaches yielded similar results, only
the multiple imputation results are presented. Analyses
were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23
(IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 1393 patients free of cancer were included in
the study. Table 1 shows selected baseline characteris-
tics according to exposure groups. At time of recruit-
ment, mean age was 54 (SD 8) years and 81% were
men. The prevalence of smoking at baseline was high
(52%), with 56% of the smokers smoking more than
20 cigarettes per day. In reassessments conducted 5 and
10 years after the beginning of the follow-up, the
prevalence of smoking decreased by more than a half
(23% and 21%, respectively), with only 5% of the
survivors at each time point smoking more than 20 cig-
arettes per day.
Figure 2 presents a map of the study area, demon-
strating the mean annual NOx levels during follow-up
as estimated by the LUR model. Mean NOx exposure
during follow-up was 24 (range 9–84) ppb. A total of
182
(13%)
participants
changed
their
residential
addresses during the ﬁrst 5 years of the follow-up.
For these patients, the correlation between average
NOx exposure during follow-up according to ﬁrst and
second addresses was very weak (Pearson’s r ¼ 0.08).
During a mean follow-up of 16 (SD 7) years (21,684
person-years), 262 new cases of cancer were diagnosed,
for an incidence rate of 12 per 1000 person years. Of
these, 28, 36 and 47 were identiﬁed as malignant neo-
plasms of the bronchus and lung (11%), kidney and

bladder (14%) and prostate gland (18%), respectively
(Figure 3). Among 635 deaths during follow-up, 105
(17%) were classiﬁed as cancer deaths.
Table 2 shows the results of the Cox regression
models for the relationship between modelled residen-
tial NOx exposure and cancer incidence and mortality.
The ﬁnal models included only variables that met the
criterion of 5% change in the regression coeﬃcient for
NOx exposure. Education and relative income did not
meet the latter criterion, and therefore were not
included in the ﬁnal models. In adjusted models, a
10 ppb increase in mean NOx exposure was associated
with HR 1.06 (95% CI 0.96–1.18) for cancer incidence.
An association of similar magnitude was detected for
cancer mortality with HR 1.08 (95% CI 0.93–1.26).
Excluding persistent heavy smokers from the analysis
(n ¼ 71) made no material diﬀerence both for cancer
incidence (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.97–1.20) and cancer
mortality (HR 1.11; 95% CI 0.95–1.29). We examined
the association between NOx exposure and lung, pros-
tate, kidney and bladder cancers. As shown in Table 2,
the HR estimate was doubled (HR 1.16; 95% CI 1.00–
1.33), compared with the risk for all cancers. After
excluding persistent heavy smokers, the HR was 1.17
(95% CI 1.01–1.36). We examined eﬀect modiﬁcation
by age, sex and nSES for the diﬀerent cancer outcomes;
however, no evidence for such an eﬀect was shown (all
P values were > 0.20). Stratiﬁcation according to these
factors resulted in a stronger association for lung, pros-
tate, kidney and bladder cancers among patients
aged  54 years (HR 1.25; 95% CI 0.96–1.62) compared
to older patients (HR 1.13; 95% CI 0.95–1.35), as well
as among patients residing in neighbourhoods of upper
SES (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.02–1.57) compared to low and
medium (HR 1.16; 95% CI 0.90–1.50 and HR 1.00;
95% CI 0.75–1.34, respectively).
Discussion
In this cohort study of MI survivors living in a predom-
inantly urban area in central Israel, we observed
positive associations, although not statistically signiﬁ-
cant, between long-term residential NOx levels, as an
indicator of TRAP exposure, and total cancer incidence
and mortality. The associations were not substantially
aﬀected by adjustment for potential confounders,
including time-varying information on smoking, and
for residential mobility during follow-up. The associ-
ation was stronger for speciﬁc cancers previously
linked to TRAP, including lung, kidney, bladder and
prostate.
Several other studies have examined the association
between exposure to TRAP and cancer, with mixed
results. A recent meta-analysis by Hamra et al.1
found that a 10 mg/m3 increase in NOx exposure was
associated with a meta-estimate of HR 1.03 (95% CI
1.01–1.05) for lung cancer. However, of the 20 studies
identiﬁed in this meta-analysis, only eight showed HR
higher than 1.05. Although lung cancer was not
examined solely in our study due to power consider-
ations, a stronger association (HR 1.16) was detected
when grouped together with other cancers previously
linked to TRAP.
Lung cancer is the main carcinogenic outcome inves-
tigated in epidemiological studies on air pollution,1–5
because the airways are the primary target organs of
inhaled carcinogenic substances. However, accumulat-
ing evidence from experiments in animals shows that
ultraﬁne particles can translocate to other organs
besides the lung, and their number in the secondary
target – although several orders of magnitude lower
than the lung dose – may not be negligible for carcino-
genic processes.12 Recent studies suggest other types of
cancer to be associated with air pollution exposure,12 in
particular prostate,9 kidney,12 bladder7,8,34 and also
breast cancers,10 particularly in relation to oestrogen
and progesterone receptors status.13 In a case–control

1.37 (95% CI 1.03–1.82) and 1.98 (95% CI 1.36–2.88)
associated with medium and high air pollution levels,
respectively. Risk for kidney cancer was also shown to
increase with NOx concentrations at the place of resi-
dence in a large population-based cohort study con-
ducted in Denmark (incidence rate ratio 1.73, 95% CI
0.89–3.73).12 In a case–control study conducted in
Canada,9 prostate cancer was found to be associated
with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, with OR of 1.27
(95% CI 1.03–1.58) after adjusting for personal and
contextual factors.
Several studies observed a stronger carcinogenic
eﬀect of TRAP among non-smokers, compared to smo-
kers.4,6,40 Puett et al.4 found a stronger association
between PM2.5 and lung cancer after restricting the
Nurses’ Health Study cohort to never smokers and
former smokers who had quit at least 10 years before.
Castano-Vinyals et al.7 also found stronger OR for blad-
der cancer associated with several indicators of exposure
to air pollution among non-smokers, compared to smo-
kers. Turner et al.11 investigated the relationship
between long-term ambient PM2.5 concentrations at
the place of residence and lung cancer mortality in a
26-year prospective study of a large cohort of lifelong
never smokers, and found that each 10 mg/m3 increase in
PM2.5 concentrations was associated with a 15–27%
increase in lung cancer mortality. These ﬁndings, along
with newly published evidence pointing to an increasing
proportion of never smokers with non-small cell lung
cancer,41 suggest that cigarette smoking partly masks
the eﬀect of TRAP, and therefore a stronger carcino-
genic eﬀect is observed among people who are not fre-
quently exposed to tobacco smoke. In our study,
analysing non-smokers only was not feasible due to a
high proportion of former and current smokers in the
cohort, and therefore we conducted a sub-analysis
excluding only persistent heavy smokers. Although
slightly higher risk estimates for all cancer outcomes
were observed, they did not diﬀer materially from
those in the entire cohort. The small number of patients
excluded in this analysis (n ¼ 71) probably prevented us
from detecting a material diﬀerence.
A stronger carcinogenic eﬀect of air pollution was
previously observed in other populations besides non-
smokers. Molecular epidemiological research provides
compelling evidence that the risk for cancer attributed
to environmental carcinogens is strongly inﬂuenced by
both genetic and acquired susceptibility.40 Acquired
susceptibility to air pollution-induced health eﬀects
might be partly explained by conditions associated
with increased oxidative stress and inﬂammation,42

including old age and chronic lung diseases, as well as
pre-existing chronic heart diseases.43,44 Along with this
assumption and taking into consideration common
environmental and behavioural factors exerting both
atherogenic and carcinogenic eﬀects,42,45 excess risk
for cancer among cardiovascular patients has been
lately investigated. Findings from recent studies suggest
a higher risk for cancer among individuals with cardio-
vascular diseases, including patients with heart failure18
and MI survivors.19,20 Few studies that investigated the
risk for the diﬀerent types of cancers, observed a par-
ticularly higher risk for prostate,46 lung and bladder
cancers,17
yet
no
increased
risk
for
colorectal
cancer.47 In addition, in recent decades a shift in the
long-term cause of death after MI has been reported
from
cardiovascular
to
non-cardiovascular,22
with
cancer as one of the main causes of death.23
While adverse health eﬀects of air pollution, includ-
ing all-cause mortality, among MI survivors have pre-
viously been investigated,44,48 its carcinogenic eﬀect
among this population in terms of both incidence and
mortality has received very little attention. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to speciﬁcally
examine the relationship between exposure to air pol-
lution and cancer outcomes among this high-risk popu-
lation of MI survivors.
Methodological considerations
Our study has several strengths. First, the study sample
is a well-deﬁned post-MI cohort, a population estab-
lished as vulnerable to the eﬀects of air pollution, as
well as being geographically deﬁned, thereby improving
relevance and generalisability. Second, residential NOx
levels, serving as a proxy for TRAP, were estimated by
LUR, which was developed using a 20-year long record
(19922011) of national air quality monitoring net-
work data in Israel, incorporating extensive spatial
information on a national scale. The role of NOx as a
marker for TRAP is most plausible in urban settings,
where traﬃc is often the primary source of NOx in the
atmosphere and the main source of variability in NOx
levels.1 Therefore, we ﬁnd our exposure metrics suitable
to estimate the eﬀect of traﬃc pollution carcinogenicity.
Third, address conﬁrmation conducted 5 years after the
baseline enabled us to account for residential mobility.
Although we were not able to identify individuals who
changed their addresses in the remaining time of the
follow-up, we assume that a small proportion of par-
ticipants changed their residential addresses in the late
years of the follow-up, as the participants’ mean age at
the second interview was 59 years. Fourth, extensive
high quality clinical and sociodemographic data were
available from multiple sources, including medical
records and structured interviews, allowing us more

accurately to control for confounding factors, including
detailed time-varying information on smoking, which is
suggested to be a substantial modiﬁer of the exposure–
cancer relationship.4,6 In addition, data on cancer
incidence and mortality were obtained by linking the
cohort with two nationwide quality-assured registries.
Several limitations of our study should be acknowl-
edged. Data on TRAP exposure was based on residential
addresses alone, without information on time-activity
patterns, time spent outdoors, or time spent at the resi-
dence. Because of a paucity of monitoring stations for
NOx in Israel before 1998, our models for the earlier
years are less precise than our models in the later years.
However, due to low temporal variability in NOx levels,
we assigned mean annual NOx levels during follow-up to
each participant, reducing model imprecision for the
early years. Our sample size did not aﬀord analysis of
certain subgroups of particular interest, including cases
of lung cancer alone, other traﬃc-related cancers, diﬀer-
ent histological types of these cancers, as well as cause-
speciﬁc cancer mortality. As our cohort is composed
of MI survivors, there is a substantially high propor-
tion of current and former smokers, which prevented
us from excluding them from the analysis. As with all
studies, residual confounding is of concern. Although
we obtained detailed information on active smoking,
we did not have information on other cancer risk
factors, including exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke, occupational exposures and residential radon,
as well as fruit consumption.2 In addition, we did not
have information on low-dose ionising radiation from
medical imaging and several cardiovascular medica-
tions suggested to contribute to the occurrence of
malignancy among cardiovascular patients.18
Clinical implications
Our study provides some support that TRAP may be
associated with the risk of cancer among patients with
pre-existing heart diseases. These ﬁndings suggest a
potential mechanism underlying the recently observed
increased
risk
of
cancer
among
this
group
of
patients.18–20 As air pollution is thought to be ‘the
most widespread environmental carcinogen’,14 chronic
exposure to its cancer-causing substances might play a
role in malignancy occurrence among this vulnerable
subpopulation. Since multi-morbidity among patients
living with chronic diseases is a subject of high priority
in clinical care,18 understanding its determinants is
important, both to reduce adverse outcomes and
implement
appropriate
preventive
interventions.
For example, in light of the evidence-based recommen-
dations for physical activity given to patients in cardiac
rehabilitation, the outdoor environment where the
activity takes place should be taken into consideration,
as health eﬀects may vary between environments with
diﬀerent pollution levels.49,50
Conclusion
In conclusion, this cohort study of MI survivors fol-
lowed-up for more than two decades shows a positive
association,
although
not
statistically
signiﬁcant,
between TRAP at the place of residence and total
cancer incidence, and a stronger association with
pooled cancer sites previously suggested to be asso-
ciated with TRAP. With the few studies available,
future research is clearly needed, particularly further
investigation of the variation in the strength of associ-
ation between speciﬁc cancers.
