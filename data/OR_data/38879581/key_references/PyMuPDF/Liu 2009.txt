To investigate the relationship between air pollution and risk of death from bladder cancer, the
authors conducted a matched case-control study using deaths that occurred in Taiwan from
1995 through 2005. Data on all eligible bladder cancer deaths were obtained from the Bureau
of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted
of people who died from causes other than cancer or diseases associated with genitourinary
problems. The controls were pair matched to the cases by sex, year of birth, and year of death.
Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case.
Classiﬁcation of exposure to municipality air pollution was based on the measured levels of
nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. The results of the present study show that there is a signif-
icant positive association between the levels of air pollution and bladder cancer mortality. The
adjusted odds ratios (95% conﬁdence interval) were 1.37 (1.03–1.82) for the group with medium
air pollution level and 1.98 (1.36–2.88) for the group with high air pollution level when com-
pared to the group with the low air pollution level. Trend analyses showed statistically signiﬁcant
trend in risk of death from bladder cancer with increasing air pollution level. The ﬁndings of
this study warrant further investigation of the role of air pollutants in the etiology of bladder
cancer.
Ambient outdoor air pollution has been implicated as a cause
of various health problems including cancer (Tomatis, 1990;
Boffetta, 2006; Curtis et al., 2006). Air pollution is a complex

mixture of different gaseous and particulate components, and it
is difﬁcult to deﬁne an exposure measure of relevance when the
biologicalmechanismsarelargelyunknown(Boffetta&Nyberg,
2003). Many of the chemical compounds are formed by incom-
plete combustion of fossil fuels and are present in the exhaust
gases from petroleum and diesel vehicles, including polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) (Soll-
Johanning et al., 1998). The mutagenic and carcinogenic effects
of PAHs and BaP are well documented in experimental studies
(IARC, 1989).

AIR POLLUTION AND BLADDER CANCER
49
The evidence regarding air pollution and lung cancer has been
the subject of several reviews (Hemminki & Pershagen, 1994;
Katsouyanni & Pershagen, 1997; Cohen, 2000; Boffetta & Ny-
berg, 2003; Vineis et al., 2004). However, limited results are
available for bladder cancer. Excess risk of bladder cancer has
been reported to be associated speciﬁcally with trafﬁc-related
air pollution among professional drivers, especially truck drivers
(Silverman et al., 1986; Boffetta & Silverman, 2001). Although
the speciﬁc exposure responsible for the elevation of risk among
drivers has not been identiﬁed, one likely candidate is motor ex-
haust. An effect of vehicle exhaust on the bladder is plausible
because metabolites of PAHs and nitro-PAHs present in exhaust
emissions are concentrated in the urine and may interact with the
urothelium of the bladder (Silverman et al., 1986). An increased
risk of bladder cancer was also observed among workers in in-
dustries with high exposure to PAHs (Kogevinas et al., 2003;
Boffetta et al., 1997). Furthermore, studies have shown an ele-
vated risk for bladder cancer in urban populations compared to
nonurban ones (Blot & Fraumeni, 1978; Greenberg, 1983; Muir
et al., 1987). It is suspected that ambient air pollution is partly
responsible for these differences, but its quantitative importance
is largely unknown.
Although most of the recent epidemiological research has
focused on the effects of short-term exposures, several stud-
ies suggest that long-term exposure may be more important in
terms of overall public health (Holgate et al., 1999; Pope et al.,
2002; Vineis et al., 2004). To date, only one study has examined
the risk of bladder cancer and exposure to ambient air pollution
(Castano-Vinyals et al., 2008). Castano-Vinyals et al. (2008) ex-
amined the association of bladder cancer risk with air pollution
(particularly industrial emissions and surrogate indices of ve-
hicle emissions), using variables including the size of the city
residence, windows facing trafﬁc street at home, numbers of
lanes and intensity of trafﬁc that the residence faced, and having
an industry with within 1 km of residence, in a large hospital-
based case-control study. Living in a city with a population of
more than 100,000 was associated with an increased risk for
bladder cancer. A higher but not statistically signiﬁcant associ-
ation was found with PAH emissions or diesel from industries
near the residence, as evaluated by experts, while lower or no
excess risk was observed for other indices of air pollution. The
study reported here was designed to explore further the possible
association of bladder cancer mortality and long-term exposure
to criteria air pollutants in Taiwan.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Study Areas
Taiwan is divided into 361 administrative districts, which are
referred to in this report as municipalities. They are the units
that are subjected here to statistical analysis. In 1994, a net-
work of 66 air quality monitoring stations was established in 66
municipalities by the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) in Taiwan. Among these, two stations were excluded be-
cause they were situated in the National Park areas and served
as background monitoring sites. The elimination left 64 moni-
toring stations situated in 64 municipalities for study. These 64
municipalities provide an opportunity to investigate the impact
of air pollution on bladder cancer.
Subject Selection
Data on all deaths of residents living in the study areas from
1995 through 2005 were obtained from the Bureau of Vital
Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health, which
is in charge of the death registration system in Taiwan. For each
death, detailed demographic information, including sex, occu-
pation, marital status, year of birth, year of death, cause of death,
place of death (municipality), and residential district (municipal-
ity), were recorded on computer tapes. The case group consisted
of all eligible bladder cancer deaths occurring in people between
50 and 69 yr of age (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases 9th
rev. [ICD-9], code 188). We excluded patients younger than
age 50 because the characteristics of early-onset bladder cancer
are thought to be different from the more prevalent later-onset
bladder cancer (Schottenfeld & Fraumeni, 1996). We excluded
bladder cancer cases older than age 70 because of the difﬁculty
in obtaining matched control subjects for them. Controls were
drawn from all other deaths excluding deaths due to neoplasms
and diseases which were associated with genitourinary diseases
(ICD9 codes 170–189 and 580–598). Control subjects were pair
matched to the cases by sex, year of birth, and year of death.
Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of
possible controls for each case.
Air Pollution Exposure Estimates
We obtained air quality data on measured concentrations of
ﬁve “criteria” pollutants (PM10, O3, CO, NO2, and SO2) for
study municipalities from the EPA’s air quality monitoring sta-
tions for 1995–2005. The monitoring stations were fully auto-
mated and provided daily readings of levels of sulfur dioxide
(SO2) (by ultraviolet ﬂuorescence), particulate matter (PM10)
(by beta-ray absorption), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (by ultravio-
let ﬂuorescence), carbon monoxide (CO) (by nondispersive in-
frared photometry), and ozone (O3) (by ultraviolet photometry).
We used the following measures for each of the pollutants: (a)
PM10, SO2, and NO2—annual mean of the average daily 24-h
values; (b) ozone—annual mean of the maximum 1h value per
day; (c) CO—annual mean of the maximum 8h value for each
day.
The municipality of residence for all cases and controls was
identiﬁed from their death certiﬁcates. For study subjects, their
municipality of residence formed the only basis for estimating
their air pollution exposure.
Socioeconomic Factor
It has been found that mortality from cancer is associated with
urbanization gradients (Greenberg, 1983; Swoboda & Friedl,

50
C.-C. LIU ET AL.
1991; Miller et al., 1987). In this study, an urbanization index
(Tzeng & Wu, 1986) was used to adjust for possible confound-
ing resulting from the different urbanizational levels among the
municipalities. Each municipality in Taiwan was given a degree
of urbanization category, 1–8. A municipality with the highest
urbanization score, such as the Taipei metropolitan area, was
classiﬁed in category 1, while mountainous areas with the low-
est score were assigned to category 8. This index has been used
in our previous studies (Yang et al., 1999; Yang & Hsieh, 1998;
Yang, 2004; Chiu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2008). For the analyses,
we further divided the urban-rural classiﬁcation into two levels:
I, urban areas (categories 1–4); and II, rural areas (categories
5–8).
Statistical Analysis
In the analysis, the subjects were divided into tertiles accord-
ingtothelevelsoftheﬁvecriteriaairpollutants.Multiplelogistic
regression was used to estimate the relative risk in relation to air
pollutants levels (Breslow & Day, 1980). We calculated odds ra-
tios (ORs) and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (95% CI) using the
group with the lowest exposure as the reference group. All ORs
were adjusted for marital status (single, married, ever married)
and urbanization level of residence (rural, urban). Tests for trend
were conducted using the method described by Mantel (1963).
Values of p < .05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
The distribution of cases and controls by selected demo-
graphic and residential characteristics is shown in Table 1. Sub-
jects who lived in urban municipalities had a signiﬁcant excess
risk of death from bladder cancer compared with those lived in
rural municipalities. Cases and controls did not differ signiﬁ-
cantly in marital status.
Table 2 shows the distribution of the ﬁve criteria air pollutants
and their associated crude ORs for the study subjects. There was
no signiﬁcant association between the risk of death from blad-
der cancer and O3 and CO levels. SO2 was positively associated
with the risk of death from bladder cancer. Compared with the
lowest tertile category, the OR of the risk of death from bladder
cancer was 1.42 (1.10–1.85) for the middle tertile category, and
1.73 (1.32–2.27) for the highest tertile category, and the trend of
increasing risk with increasing SO2 levels was highly signiﬁcant
(p for trend < .001). There was also a trend for increased risk
of death from bladder cancer associated with NO2 levels (p for
trend = .002), with an OR of 1.41 (1.08–1.84) in the middle ter-
tile category and 1.73 (1.32–2.34) in the highest tertile category.
A signiﬁcant increase in risk of death from bladder cancer was
seen in the highest tertile category of PM10 (OR = 1.39, 95% CI
= 1.06–1.83) but not in the middle tertile category (OR = 1.08,
95% CI = 0.83–1.41). The test of trend for these associations
were statistically signiﬁcant (p = .02).
Since the results for SO2 and NO2 were more suggestive of a
positive association with the risk of death from bladder cancer,
a combined index of exposure to community air pollution based
on SO2 and NO2 concentrations was developed subsequently
using three levels: low = NO2 ≤20.99 ppb (the lowest tertile)
and SO2 ≤4.32 ppb (the lowest tertile); high = NO2 ≥27.33
ppb (the highest tertile) and SO2 ≥6.49 ppb (the highest tertile);
medium = others.
Table 3 shows the distribution of the resulting variable. The
ORs for the risk of death from bladder cancer were signiﬁcantly
higher for the two groups with high levels of air pollution. The

urbanization level of residence was correlated with air pollu-
tion categories (data not shown) but was controlled for in the
multivariate analyses. Adjustments for the urbanization level of
residence and marital status only slightly altered the ORs. There-
fore, the adjusted ORs presented in Table 3 can be interpreted
as free from confounding by the earlier mentioned variables.
The adjusted OR (95% CI) was 1.37 (1.03–1.82) for the group
with medium air pollution level and 1.98 (1.36–2.88) for the
group with high air pollution level when compared to the group
with the low air pollution level. Trend analyses showed statisti-
cally signiﬁcant trend in risk of death from bladder cancer with
increasing air pollution level (p for trend <.001).
DISCUSSION
This study used a death-certiﬁcate-based case-control study
to examine the relationship between the risk of death from blad-
der cancer and outdoor air pollution in Taiwan. The results of
the present study show that people who lived in the group of
municipalities with high levels of air pollution (based on mea-
sured levels of NO2 and SO2) were at a statistically signiﬁcant
increased risk of death from bladder cancer compared to the
group living in municipalities with the low air pollution level
after controlling for possible confounders.
There have been a number of epidemiological studies that
have assessed the increased risk of bladder cancer from living
in an urban rather than a rural area. In general, bladder can-
cer mortality had been considerably higher in urban populations
than nonurban ones (Blot & Fraumeni, 1978; Greenberg, 1983;
Muir et al., 1987). The only “urban factor” consistently men-
tioned in the literature is air pollution, suggesting that living in
an urban area is a surrogate for increased air pollution exposure
(Greenberg, 1983).
The ﬁve pollutants identiﬁed as being of greatest concern
from a health perspective, known as “criteria” pollutants, are
O3, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO. Our study found that NO2 and
SO2 were more likely to be responsible for the increased risk of
death from bladder cancer. To the authors’ knowledge, no studies
have investigated the association between ambient criteria air
pollutants and the risk of death from bladder cancer.
Our previous study found that death from lung cancer for
females is signiﬁcantly associated with residential petrochem-
ical air pollution (Yang et al., 1999). The average levels of air
pollutants in the municipalities with higher petrochemical air
pollution exposure index were higher than in those municipali-
ties with lower petrochemical air pollution exposure index (Yang
et al., 1999). Levels of trafﬁc intensity were not available to val-
idate the trafﬁc-related exposure to air pollutants. It is possible
that our ﬁnding of a positive association between air pollution
and the risk of death from bladder cancer may be at least par-
tially related to air pollution from petrochemical industries. The
petrochemical industry is considered to be the main source of
industrial air pollution in Taiwan (EPA/Taiwan, 2002). The pol-
lutants emitted by the petrochemical industries include not only
PAHs but also large quantities of criteria pollutants, particularly
SO2 and NO2 (EPA/Taiwan, 2002; Suess et al., 1985). To our
knowledge there is only one epidemiologic study examining the
relationship between risk of bladder cancer and living near spe-
ciﬁc sources of industrial air pollution (Castano-Vinyals et al.,
2008). A higher but not statistically signiﬁcant risk was observed
among subjects with residence within 1 km of an industry with
either PAH or diesel emissions.
Despite their inherent limitations (Morgenstern, 1982),
studies of ecological correlation between mortality and environ-
mental exposures are widely used to generate or discredit epi-
demiological hypotheses. Before any conclusion based on such
a mortality analysis is made, however, the completeness and ac-
curacy of the death registration system needs to be evaluated.
In Taiwan, any birth, death, marriage/divorce, and migration is
mandatory to register in the household registration ofﬁces. De-
mographic and vital statistics data derived from the household
registration system are quite complete and accurate in Taiwan.
Although causes of death may be misdiagnosed and/or misclas-
siﬁed, the problem has been minimized through the improve-
ment in the veriﬁcation and classiﬁcation of causes of death in
Taiwan since 1972. Furthermore, malignant neoplasms, includ-
ing bladder cancer, were found to be among the most unam-
biguously classiﬁed causes of death in Taiwan (Chen & Wang,
1990). Because of the potentially fatal outcome for this disease,
it is believed that all bladder cancer cases exposed to either high
or low levels of air pollution have had access to medical care
regardless of geographical location.
Since the measure of effect in this study is mortality rather
than incidence, migration during the interval between cancer di-
agnosis and death must also be considered. During this period,
cancer diagnosis may inﬂuence a decision to migrate and possi-
bly introduce bias. Data are not available for the differences in
survival rates of bladder cancer patients between high and low
air pollution exposure areas. If there is a trend toward migration
to more urban or high air polluted areas because of proximity
to medical care for example, a spurious association between air
pollution exposure and cancer death would result.
Of greater concern is whether the 11-yr (1995–2005) avarage
levels of air pollution correspond to the relative levels in periods
20–30 yr previously. This is important since it is likely that
exposure to causal factors would precede cancer mortality by at
least 20 yr (the latency period for carcinogen exposure). The air
pollution levels are not available for the study areas before 1995.
However, we believe that the correlation between the current
levels (1995–2005) and levels 20–30 yr ago would be high since
a municipality’s urbanization and industralization are gradual.
We therefore assumed that average levels of air pollution in the
study periods were a reasonable indicator of historical levels
occurring over the past 20 to 30 yr.
Our study employed an ecologic design using group level
exposure data. It was assumed that individuals living in the
municipalities of higher air pollution exposure index, on aver-
age, experienced a higher exposure to hazardous air pollutants
than subjects residing in municipalities with less air pollution.

AIR POLLUTION AND BLADDER CANCER
53
Previously, Yang et al. (1999) veriﬁed this phenomenon. How-
ever, signiﬁcant concentration variations might exist within a
municipality and therefore group exposure levels do not nec-
essarily correspond to individual exposure levels (Reynolds et
al., 2003). Likewise, a study of this nature can not account for
variations in susceptibility among individuals with comparable
exposures (Reynolds et al., 2003). Additionally, potential ex-
posure misclassiﬁcation may also have resulted from differing
individual time-activity and behavior patterns of each subject
(Elliott et al., 2000). While these sources of misclassiﬁcation
are important, such misclassiﬁcation of exposure is most likely
to be nondifferential (i.e., unlikely to be associated with blad-
der cancer), which would reduce the magnitude of association
rather than introduce a positive bias into the association. There-
fore, it is unlikely that the observed positive association between
air pollution exposure index and the risk of death from bladder
cancer was a result of exposure misclassiﬁcation. To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst study to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association be-
tween residential exposure to air pollution exposure index and
risk of death from bladder cancer. However, because there is
no evidence to date for an association between residential ex-
posure to air pollution and risk of death from bladder cancer,
the possibility that this is a chance ﬁnding needs to also be
considered.
Long-term arsenic exposure from drinking water has been
found to be associated with bladder cancer mortality in Taiwan
(Chen et al., 1988). However, this was found only in a limited
area in four municipalities, which were in the so-called blackfoot
disease (BFD) endemic areas. Residents in BFD endemic areas
consumed artesian well water with high arsenic content (ranged
from 0.35 to 1.14 ppm) since 1910. These 4 municipalities were
not included in our 64 study municipalities. All residents in the
study area obtained their drinking water from public drinking
water supply systems served by the Taiwan (or Taipei) Water
Supply Corp. The tap water came from several water reservoirs.
The arsenic concentration of water in these reservoirs was non-
detectable (<0.9 ppb) (TWSC, 1997). Therefore, the potential
inﬂuence from arsenic in drinking water is probably not impor-
tant.
Cigarette smoking is well established as a cause of bladder
cancer (Alberg et al., 2007; Zeegers et al., 2000; Schottenfeld
& Fraumeni, 1996). As with active cigarette smoking, environ-
mental tobacco smoke (ETS) contains arylamines, which are
established bladder carcinogens (Vineis et al., 2004). The dose
of carcinogens from ETS is relatively small compared to that
from active smoking, but it has been hypothesized to make a
disproportionately large contribution to bladder carcinogenesis
(Vineis et al., 2004). There is, unfortunately, no information
available on these variables for our individual study subjects.
We also did not collect data on other suspected risk factors for
bladder cancer, such as occupation exposure to bladder carcino-
gens and socioeconomic status (such as income levels) for the
study subjects (Schottenfeld & Fraumeni, 1996). Areas with
high industrial activity have higher air pollution levels and the
people who work in those industries tend to live around them.
It is, therefore, likely that people with high occupational ex-
posures tend to live in areas with higher air pollution levels.
However, it is difﬁcult to predict how the distributions of these
variables might have differed according to air pollution exposure
and hence, acted to confound the associations observed in the
present study. For these reasons, the results of this study should
be considered hypothesis-generating. Even though more com-
plete information would have been desirable, one measure of
the study’s internal validity is that the observed associations for
air pollution exposure pointed in the direction expected based
on previous research.
In summary, this study shows that under the conditions
found in Taiwan, air pollution may increase the risk of death
from bladder cancer. The ﬁndings of this study warrant fur-
ther investigation of the role of air pollutants in the etiology
of bladder cancer. Future study should increase the precision
of the estimation of the individual’s air pollution exposure and
take into account indoor as well as mobile pollution sources,
and control for confounding factors such as smoking and
occupation.
