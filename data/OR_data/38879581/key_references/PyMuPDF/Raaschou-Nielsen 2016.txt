Several studies have indicated weakly increased risk for kidney cancer among occupational groups exposed to gasoline
vapors, engine exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other air pollutants, although not consistently. It was the aim
to investigate possible associations between outdoor air pollution at the residence and the incidence of kidney parenchyma
cancer in the general population. We used data from 14 European cohorts from the ESCAPE study. We geocoded and assessed
air pollution concentrations at baseline addresses by land-use regression models for particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PMcoarse,
PM2.5 absorbance (soot)) and nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOx), and collected data on traffic. We used Cox regression models with
adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and random effects models for meta-analyses to calculate
summary hazard ratios (HRs). The 289,002 cohort members contributed 4,111,908 person-years at risk. During follow-up
(mean 14.2 years) 697 incident cancers of the kidney parenchyma were diagnosed. The meta-analyses showed higher HRs in
association with higher PM concentration, e.g. HR 5 1.57 (95%CI: 0.81–3.01) per 5 lg/m3 PM2.5 and HR 5 1.36 (95%CI:
0.84–2.19) per 1025m21 PM2.5 absorbance, albeit never statistically significant. The HRs in association with nitrogen oxides
and traffic density on the nearest street were slightly above one. Sensitivity analyses among participants who did not change
residence during follow-up showed stronger associations, but none were statistically significant. Our study provides
suggestive evidence that exposure to outdoor PM at the residence may be associated with higher risk for kidney parenchyma
cancer; the results should be interpreted cautiously as associations may be due to chance.
Introduction
A working group established under the International Agency
for Research on Cancer recently classiﬁed outdoor air pollu-
tion in general, and particulate matter (PM) in particular, as
carcinogenic to humans.1 This classiﬁcation was based on,
among others, an extensive review of the epidemiological lit-
erature, which provided convincing evidence for an associa-
tion with lung cancer. Positive associations were also noted
for cancer of the urinary bladder and childhood leukemia,
whereas associations between air pollution and other cancers
had only been sparsely studied.1
Over 90% of kidney cancers develop in the kidney paren-
chyma and the vast majority of these are adenocarcinomas
(often denoted as renal cell carcinomas); the <10% of kidney
cancers, which develops in the renal pelvis, are primarily of
the transitional cell type.2 Worldwide, the incidence rates of
kidney cancer increased until the mid-1990s when they
plateaued or declined in many countries.2 Incidence rates of
kidney parenchyma cancer are relatively high in Europe with
rates between 3 and 15 per 100,000 in different countries.2
Active tobacco smoking, obesity and hypertension are estab-
lished risk factors for cancer of the kidney parenchyma2,3
and there is also suggestive evidence for, among others, expo-
sure to environmental tobacco smoke.4,5 Several studies of
occupational groups, such as transport workers, drivers,
policemen, metal foundry workers and gasoline service sta-
tion workers exposed to gasoline vapors, engine exhaust,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other air pollutants,
have indicated weakly increased risk for kidney cancer,6–8
although the literature is neither consistent9 nor conclusive.10
Garcia-Perez et al. found higher kidney cancer mortality in
Spanish general populations exposed to ambient air pollution
from incinerators and hazardous waste treatment plants11
and a cohort study of a general Danish population found
positive but statistically insigniﬁcant associations between
nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the residence and kidney cancer
incidence but no association with amount of street trafﬁc
near the residence.12 Further, ultraﬁne particles can translo-
cate from the airways to the kidney and other organs of
experimental animals13 and experiments have shown that
What’s new?
Ambient air pollution is an established cause of lung cancer. It is of considerable public health interest whether air pollution
also causes other cancers. A few studies indicated that air pollution might cause kidney cancer. These authors investigated a
possible link between kidney parenchyma cancer and air pollution at the residence of 289,002 participants of 14 European
cohorts. They found an increased risk in association with particulate matter air pollution, although not statistically significant.

diesel particles can induce cancer-relevant processes in the
kidneys.14,15
We recently reported from the European Study of Cohorts
for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) that PM in outdoor air
with a diameter <10 mm (PM10) and 2.5 mm (PM2.5) at the
residence is associated with risk for the development of lung
cancer16 and natural-cause mortality.17
The aim of our study was to investigate a possible association
between outdoor air pollution and the risk for cancer of the
kidney parenchyma in general European populations, applying
the methods developed in ESCAPE.
Materials and Methods
Design and participants
The ESCAPE study on lung cancer included 12 European areas
where air pollution measurements were performed, land use
regression (LUR) models were developed, and adult cohort
studies with cancer incidence data were located. Our study
included the 14 cohorts, located in 10 areas, with information
on incident cancer, the most important potential confounders,
with at least 20 incident kidney parenchyma cancer cases during
follow-up and where the resources needed for participation
were available. The 14 cohorts were in Sweden (European Pro-
spective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition[EPIC]-Umeå,

Study and TwinGene [SALT], Stockholm 60 years old and

(EPIC-San Sebastian; Fig. 1). Our previous study on lung cancer
included 312,944 participants of 17 cohorts in 12 study areas.
Our study on kidney parenchyma cancer included 289,002 par-
ticipants, i.e. a large fraction of our previous study. Most of the
study areas were large cities and the surrounding suburban or
Figure 1. Areas where cohort members lived, measurements were taken and land-use regression models for prediction of air pollution were
developed.

rural communities, as speciﬁed in the online appendix (pp. 4–
13). A pooled analysis of all cohort data was not possible due to
data-transfer and privacy issues but data from the four Stock-
holm cohorts (SNAC-K, SALT, 60-y/IMPROVE and SDPP)
were pooled, and analyzed and denoted as one cohort (Cardio-
vascular Effects of Air pollution and Noise in Stockholm
[CEANS]) in the following. Similarly, data from the two cohorts
from the Netherlands (EPIC-MORGEN and EPIC-PROSPECT)
were pooled, analyzed and denoted as one [EPIC-NL]. Thus, ten
cohort data sets were analyzed. Information on lifestyle etc.
among cohort participants was obtained by questionnaires or
interviews at enrolment (see online appendix, Supplementary
Table S1). The local ethical and data protection authorities
approved the use of cohort data. All participants signed
informed consent forms at enrolment.
Deﬁnition of incident cancer of the kidney parenchyma
We included cancers located in the kidney parenchyma
(ICD10/ICDO3: C64). We only included primary cancers
(i.e., not metastases). The cohort members were followed up
for cancer incidence in national or local cancer registries.
Exposure assessment
Annual outdoor air pollution concentrations at the baseline
residential addresses of study participants were estimated by
LUR models in a three-step, standardized procedure that has
been described elsewhere.18,19 First, PM with an aerodynamic
diameter <10 mm (PM10), PM with aerodynamic diameter
<2.5 mm (PM2.5), PM2.5 absorbance (a marker for black carbon
and soot), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) were measured three times during different seasons at
locations for each cohort population between October 2008
and April 2011. Coarse PM was calculated as the difference
between PM10 and PM2.5. In the Umeå, Varese and San Sebas-
tian areas only NO2 and NOx was measured. Results from
the three measurements were averaged, adjusting for tempo-
ral trends using data from a background monitoring site with
continuous data.18,20 PM ﬁlters were weighed before and after
each measurement centrally at IRAS, Utrecht University. Sec-
ond, we collected information about potential predictor varia-
bles relating to nearby trafﬁc intensity, population/household
density and land use from Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), and evaluated these to explain spatial variation of
annual
average
concentrations
using
regression
model-
ling.18,19 In general, predictors for PM10, PM2.5, NOx and NO2
related to trafﬁc/roads and population/building density. Vari-
ables related to industry, port and altitude were also predic-
tors in some models. These LUR models were evaluated
using Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation, which successively
leaves one site out of the data and reﬁts the model with the
remaining N-1 sites. The models generally explained a large
fraction of measured spatial variation, the r2 from leave-one-
out cross-validation usually falling between 0.60 and 0.80.16
Finally, we used the models to assess exposure at the baseline
address of each cohort member. If values of predictor
variables for the cohort addresses were outside the range of
values for the monitoring sites, we truncated the values to
the minimum or maximum values at the monitoring sites.
We truncated to prevent unrealistic predictions (e.g., related
to too small distance to roads in GIS) and because we did
not want to extrapolate the derived model beyond the range,
for which it was developed. Truncation has been shown to
improve predictions at independent sites.21 We also collected
information on trafﬁc intensity (vehicles/day) on the nearest
street. As part of the TRANSPHORM project, we used simi-
lar methods to predict concentrations of eight elements in
PM at participants’ baseline addresses22,23; we describe these
procedures in the online appendix (pp. 2).
Statistical
analyses.
The
association
between
long-term
exposure to air pollution and incidence of kidney parenchyma
cancer was analyzed in each cohort separately at the local cen-
tre by common standardized protocols for exposure assess-
ment, outcome deﬁnition, confounder models and statistical
analyses. Cohort-speciﬁc effect estimates were combined by
meta-analysis at the Danish Cancer Society Research Center,
Copenhagen, Denmark.
We ﬁtted Cox proportional hazards regression models for
each cohort, with age as the underlying time scale and followed
up participants from enrolment until the time of a kidney
parenchyma cancer diagnosis or censoring. We excluded par-
ticipants with a cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer)
before enrolment and censored at the time of death, a diagnosis
of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), emi-
gration or end of follow-up, whichever came ﬁrst. We censored
participants with another cancer because cancer treatment and
change of life style might change the subsequent risk for devel-
opment of another cancer. Air pollution exposure was analyzed
as a linear variable in three a-priori speciﬁed confounder
models. Model 1 included sex, calendar time (year of enrol-
ment; linear) and age (time axis). Model 2 additionally adjusted
for smoking status (never/former/current), smoking intensity
(g
tobacco/day),
smoking
duration
(years),
occupation/
employment status (different deﬁnitions, see online appendix
pp. 3–13), educational level (low, medium, high), body mass
index (BMI) (linear, kg/m2) and hypertension (yes/no) (all
referring to baseline). Model 3 (the main model) further adjust-
ed for area-level socio-economic status. Information on at least
age, sex, calendar time, smoking status, smoking intensity,
smoking duration and BMI was available in all cohorts. We
provide further information on the available variables and their
deﬁnition and distribution in each cohort in the online
appendix (pp. 4–13 and Supplementary Table S1). Potential
confounders were based on previous literature on risk factors
for kidney cancer and availability.
We undertook a number of sensitivity analyses for each
cohort, all with confounder model 3. First, we repeated the
analyses after restriction to participants who had lived at the
baseline address throughout the follow-up period, thus reduc-
ing misclassiﬁcation of long-term exposure to air pollution in

this sub-population. Second, we added an indicator of degree
of urbanization. Thirdly, we tested the linear assumption in
the relation between each air pollutant and kidney parenchy-
ma cancer by replacing the linear term with a natural cubic
spline with three equally spaced inner knots, and compared
the model ﬁt of the linear and the spline models by the
likelihood-ratio test. Fourthly, we repeated the analyses using
back-extrapolated NO2 and NOx exposure data, which is
described further in the online appendix (pp. 2–3).
In the meta-analysis, we used random-effects models to
summarize the results for cohorts.24 I2 statistics25 and p-values
for the v2 test from Cochran’s Q were calculated to determine
heterogeneity among cohort-speciﬁc effect estimates. We used
a common STATA (www.stata.com) script for all analyses.
Results
Fourteen cohorts in seven European countries contributed to
our study. Altogether 289,002 cohort members contributed
4,111,908 person-years at risk and 697 incident kidney paren-
chyma cases were registered during follow-up (mean, 14.2
years). The number of participants and cases varied consider-
ably, the Austrian cohorts contributing almost half the cases
(Table 1). The cohort areas represented a wide range of
exposures, with 3–11 times higher mean air pollution con-
centrations in some Southern than Northern areas (Table 1).
The variation in exposure within study areas was substantial,
as shown previously.16 The mean age at enrolment varied
from 43 to 57 years (Table 1).
The meta-analyses showed higher summary hazard ratios
(HRs) in association with higher PM concentration, e.g.
HR 5 1.57 (95% CI: 0.81–3.01) per 5 lg/m3
PM2.5 and
HR 5 1.36 (95% CI: 0.84–2.19) per 1025m21 PM2.5 absorbance
(soot), albeit never statistically signiﬁcant (Table 2). The HRs
in association with nitrogen oxides and trafﬁc were slightly
above one. Adjustment did not affect the summary HRs much
(Table 2). The summary HRs for PM10, PM coarse and PM2.5
were based on low to moderate heterogeneity between cohort-
speciﬁc results; all p-values for heterogeneity were 0.10 (Table
2). For the large VHM&PP cohort, HRs in association with
PM2.5 and
PM2.5 absorbance were lower than one (PM2.5
HR 5 0.73; 95% CI: 0.47–1.14); all other cohorts showed
increased risk in association with PM2.5 exposure (Fig. 2 and
online Supplementary Fig. S1). Analyses based on participants
who did not change residence during follow-up showed stron-
ger associations, but none was statistically signiﬁcant (Table 3).
These results were based on stronger heterogeneity, which were
statistically signiﬁcant for PM2.5 and PM10 (p 0.01) (Table 3).
The assumption of linearity was not violated (online Sup-
plementary Table S2). Adjustment for degree of urbanization
did not affect the results much (online Supplementary Table
S3) and use of back-extrapolated NO2 and NOx data only
affected the results marginally (online appendix, pp. 2–3 and
Supplementary Table S4).
Explorative analyses of 8 PM elements in two particle frac-
tions (PM10 and
PM2.5) showed mostly elevated HRs. HRs
were elevated in both particle fractions for Cu, Fe, Zn, V and
Si. With the exception of an HR of 2.17 (95% CI: 1.19–3.97)
per 100 ng/m3 vanadium in PM10, none of the HRs were sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (online Supplementary Table S5). Restric-
tion to cohort participants who lived at the same residence
during follow-up provided mostly higher HRs for the PM
elements (online Supplementary Table S5).

participants who did not change residence during follow-up
showed stronger associations, but none was statistically signiﬁcant.
Our study beneﬁted from a large number of cohort partic-
ipants from general populations with widely different levels
of air pollution and complete follow-up. The strengths of our
study also include the use of standardized methods for expo-
sure assessment and data analyses across all cohorts. We
adjusted the analyses for a number of potential confounders.
In particular, all cohort-speciﬁc analyses were adjusted for
the important smoking variables smoking status, smoking
intensity and smoking duration, but the possibility of residual
confounding cannot be excluded. We assessed a comprehen-
sive set of pollutants at address-level and the individual expo-
sure assessment was based on actual measurements made in
the development of LUR models for the detection of within-
area contrasts. Since pooling of data across all cohorts was
not possible we could not take full advantage of the exposure
contrasts across Europe.
In our study, the HRs for kidney parenchyma cancer were
actually larger than those reported in the ESCAPE study for
lung cancer, which were 1.22 (1.03, 1.45), 1.18 (0.96, 1.46) and
1.12 (0.88, 1.42) for PM10, PM2.5 and PM2.5 absorbance.16 The
conﬁdence intervals of the HRs for kidney parenchyma cancer
were wider, however, which is likely due to the smaller number
of cases (697 kidney parenchyma vs. 2095 lung cancer cases);
the person time under risk was virtually the same. A previous
study found an increased HR for kidney cancer in association
with NOx at the residence,12 which was not found in our study.
Our ﬁnding of non-signiﬁcantly elevated HRs could be affected
by a combination of the number of cancer cases, misclassiﬁca-
tion of exposure, confounding and chance. Several factors may
have contributed to misclassiﬁcation of the exposure. Although
our LUR models performed well, with leave-one-out-cross-
validation r2 values typically between 0.6 and 0.8,16 any model
incorporates some degree of misclassiﬁcation. Also, we used
data on air pollution for 2008–2011 in developing our LUR
models but applied them to baseline addresses mainly 10–15
years earlier. Recent research in Rome, the Netherlands and
Vancouver has shown that the spatial distribution of air pollu-
tion is relatively stable over 10–year periods,26–28 a study
showed high correlations between trafﬁc intensities on Dutch
streets over a 10-year period29 and spatial models for black
smoke in the United Kingdom provided reasonable predictions
even going back to the 1960s,30 indicating that more recent esti-
mations reﬂect also historical exposure contrasts. In our study,
exposure was assessed at the enrolment address; moving from
that address during follow-up might lead to misclassiﬁcation of
the exposure relevant to later development of cancer. Our
results show stronger associations between air pollution and
the risk for kidney parenchyma cancer among people who lived
at the same address throughout follow-up, which would be
expected if air pollution truly causes kidney parenchyma can-
cer. Altogether, we would expect the exposure misclassiﬁcation
in our study to be non-differential and consequently not to cre-
ate artiﬁcial associations but rather to inﬂuence the HRs
towards unity. The previously reported associations between
air pollution and all-cause mortality17 and lung cancer16 using
the same exposure assessment method as in our study indicates
that the method indeed detects effects of exposure contrasts.
The airways are the primary target organs for inhaled par-
ticles but evidence from experimental studies with animals
shows that ultraﬁne particles can translocate to other organs,

such as the liver, kidneys, heart and brain.13,31–33 Although the
amount of particles accumulating in secondary target organs,
such as the kidney, is many times lower than the lung tissue
dose, it may be relevant for carcinogenic processes.34,35 Experi-
mental evidence supports that diesel particles induce cancer-
relevant processes in the kidneys: diesel exhaust particles induced
oxidative stress in cultured human kidney cells14 and exacerbat-
ed renal oxidative stress, inﬂammation and DNA damage in
mice.15 We are aware of no previous studies on outdoor PM air
pollution and kidney cancer in general populations.
The explorative analyses of 8 PM elements showed mostly
non-signiﬁcantly elevated HRs for copper, iron, zinc, vanadi-
um and silicon for both particle fractions. The vanadium
content of PM2.5 was signiﬁcantly associated with risk for kid-
ney parenchyma cancer, with substantially elevated HRs in
both PM10 and PM2.5. This may point to a speciﬁc source of
particles. However, we do not want to over-interpret the
vanadium ﬁndings as one signiﬁcant association is close to
what would be expected by chance among the 16 tests under-
taken for the PM element analyses, given our 5% signiﬁcance
level. Each PM element can be considered as representing
different air pollution sources with copper, iron and zinc
being indicators mainly of non-tailpipe trafﬁc emissions such
as brake and tire wear, sulfur mainly indicating long-range
transport, nickel and vanadium indicating mixed oil-burning
and industry, silicon crustal material and potassium biomass
burning.22,36–38
The Austrian VHM&PP cohort was the only cohort where
PM2.5 and
PM2.5 absorbance (soot) was not associated with
higher risk for kidney parenchyma cancer (Fig. 2 and online
Supplementary Fig. S1). This large cohort inﬂuenced the sum-
mary HRs substantially: without the VHM&PP cohort, the
summary HR was 1.95 (1.21, 3.14) for PM2.5. We cannot explain
the opposite results with any bias or design issue related to spe-
ciﬁcally this cohort; chance might be the explanation. The latter
interpretation is supported by the fact that in the lung cancer
and all-cause mortality ESCAPE analyses, elevated HRs were
found for this cohort, that did not affect the summary HRs.16,17
A post-hoc explanation could be that the concentrations of
vanadium were lowest in this cohort, while vanadium was asso-
ciated with the highest HRs among the analyzed PM elements.
In conclusion, our study provides suggestive evidence that
exposure to outdoor PM at the residence may be associated
with higher risk for kidney parenchyma cancer. The result
should be interpreted with caution and future studies are
needed to conﬁrm or reject this hypothesis.
