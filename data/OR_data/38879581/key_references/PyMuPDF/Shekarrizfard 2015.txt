In two earlier case–control studies conducted in Montreal, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker for trafﬁc-
related air pollution was found to be associated with the incidence of postmenopausal breast cancer and
prostate cancer. These studies relied on a land use regression model (LUR) for NO2 that is commonly used
in epidemiologic studies for deriving estimates of trafﬁc-related air pollution. Here, we investigate the
use of a transportation model developed during the summer season to generate a measure of trafﬁc
emissions as an alternative to the LUR model. Our trafﬁc model provides estimates of emissions of ni-
trogen oxides (NOx) at the level of individual roads, as does the LUR model. Our main objective was to
compare the distribution of the spatial estimates of NOx computed from our transportation model to the
distribution obtained from the LUR model. A secondary objective was to compare estimates of risk using
these two exposure estimates. We observed that the correlation (spearman) between our two measures
of exposure (NO2 and NOx) ranged from less than 0.3 to more than 0.9 across Montreal neighborhoods.
The most important factor affecting the “agreement” between the two measures in a speciﬁc area was
found to be the length of roads. Areas affected by a high level of trafﬁc-related air pollution had a far
better agreement between the two exposure measures. A comparison of odds ratios (ORs) obtained from
NO2 and NOx used in two case–control studies of breast and prostate cancer, showed that the differences
between the ORs associated with NO2 exposure vs NOx exposure differed by 5.2–8.8%.

1. Introduction
Trafﬁc-related air pollution has a large impact on public health;
in numerous studies associations have been found between
chronic and acute exposures to trafﬁc emissions and respiratory
and cardiovascular effects (Cesaroni et al., 2012; Clark et al., 2012;
Gan et al., 2011; Janssen et al., 2011; Carlsten et al., 2011; Brook
et al., 2010; Jerrett et al., 2009; Marshall et al., 2008; Pope and
Dockery 2006). In particular, two recent studies conducted in
Montreal, Canada, have shown positive associations between an-
nual estimates of concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), an
accepted marker of trafﬁc-related air pollution, and the incidence
of postmenopausal breast cancer (Crouse et al., 2010) and of
prostate cancer (Parent et al., 2013).
In urban areas, air pollution exhibits substantial seasonal and
spatial variability. Different methods have been used to quantify
spatial variability, including using data from ﬁxed-site monitoring
stations (Brauer and Brook, 1997), land-use regression (LUR)
(Johnson et al., 2010; Hoek et al., 2008; Ryan and LeMasters, 2007;

Gilbert et al., 2005), and dispersion models (Tartakovsky et al.,
2013; Hatzopoulou and Miller, 2010; Beckx et al., 2009; Cook et al.,
2008; Dhondt et al., 2012; Lefebvre et al., 2013). LUR models have
been developed for many metropolitan areas and are often used to
investigate associations between air pollution exposure and spe-
ciﬁc health effects (Crouse et al., 2009; Arain et al., 2007). How-
ever, their reliability in predicting accurate exposures depends on
the density of the established monitoring network, which in turn,
largely affects the costs of developing a LUR model.
In this paper, we used a transportation model (Sider et al.,
2013) with a detailed capability to model emissions from trafﬁc.
This transportation model simulates trafﬁc ﬂows and emissions
over an entire metropolitan region, and estimates trafﬁc emissions
of nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the level of individual roads. We also
make use of a LUR model for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) developed
previously by us for Montreal (Crouse et al., 2009). Finally, we use
data from a case–control study of postmenopausal breast cancer
and another case–control study of prostate cancer that were pre-
viously used to estimate associations with annual trafﬁc-related
concentrations of NO2 estimated at the residences of all partici-
pants (Crouse et al., 2010; Parent et al., 2013). Our main objective
was to compare the distribution of the spatial estimates of NOx
computed from our transportation model to the distribution of
NO2 obtained from a LUR model. A secondary objective was to
compare estimates of risk using these two exposure estimates; in
doing so, we exploited two case–control studies of cancer con-
ducted previously. In fact, an advantage of using emission models
to derive exposure relates to their “policy sensitivity”, one could
potentially evaluate the effects of changes in land-use, transpor-
tation infrastructure, and travel demand on trafﬁc emissions and
re-investigate the same associations with health outcomes.
A number of studies have addressed the question of un-
certainty in estimating the contribution of trafﬁc to air pollution
while others have evaluated the effects of different indices of ex-
posure to trafﬁc-related air pollution (e.g. NO2, NOx, proximity to
trafﬁc, total trafﬁc volume) on health outcomes (Wu et al., 2011;
Molitor et al., 2007; Ryan et al., 2007). As an example, Wu et al.
(2011) compared different exposure methods: a LUR model, a
dispersion model (using the simple Gaussian CALINE4 software),
and a trafﬁc-density measure. The authors observed that the risk
of adverse pregnancy outcomes (such as preterm birth) associated
with exposure to trafﬁc-related air pollution was smaller when
exposures were assigned based on trafﬁc density as compared to
LUR or dispersion modeling. Molitor et al. (2007) emphasized the
importance of improving exposure assessment through the con-
sideration of advanced techniques in lieu of spatial models such as
LUR although no direct comparison between measures was con-
ducted. Their study was mainly focused on the role of spatial au-
tocorrelation in the estimation of health effects.
In this study, our focus is on comparing exposure estimates and
evaluating how they may change depending on the model. Our
measure of exposure to trafﬁc-generated NOx goes beyond trafﬁc-
density (emissions are affected by trafﬁc ﬂows but also by ﬂeet
characteristics, speed, and road conﬁguration) and we hypothesize
that this measure would be more representative of trafﬁc-related
air pollution. Because ambient NO2 is largely emitted by vehicular
trafﬁc in urban areas, we hypothesize that concentrations of NO2
would be associated with emissions of trafﬁc-related NOx. How-
ever, because ambient NO2 is also affected by other sources (such
as industries), we would expect that a model of trafﬁc NOx emis-
sions will underestimate the impact of trafﬁc on NO2 away from
the roadways. While trafﬁc is not always captured as a predictor in
land-use regression models of NO2, the results of LUR may differ
from those obtained from transport emission models (Health Ef-
fects institute, 2010; Solomon et al., 2012). For example, Crouse
et al. (2009) found that the predictive power of their proposed LUR
(as measured by the R-squared) was improved by 2–4% after
adding trafﬁc data as a predictor.
Our speciﬁc objectives were: 1) to generate road-level emis-
sions of NOx in Montreal for summer conditions; 2) to determine
the correlation between emissions of NOx with concentrations of
NO2 derived from a LUR model estimated from sampling in a
summer period; and 3) to explore the resulting estimates of risk
using these two exposure measures. We only consider the case of
comparing “current” estimates of exposure and not of estimating
historical ones, although we note that Crouse et al. (2010) have
found that the spatial distributions do not vary dramatically over a
10–20 year period. We emphasize that these comparisons in risk
are only meant for the purposes of showing a range of plausible
estimates between these two methods of estimating exposure to

markers of trafﬁc-related air pollution; the risk estimates shown in
Crouse et al. (2010) and Parent et al. (2013) derived from an annual
LUR model (Crouse et al., 2009) should be considered as the de-
ﬁnitive ones.
2. Materials and methods
Fig. 1 presents the study methodology illustrating that we ex-
amined the spatial variability of NO2 concentrations generated
from a LUR model for the summer season with NOx emissions si-
mulated also for summer conditions across the Island of Montreal.
We used both models to generate trafﬁc-related air pollution ex-
posure measures and compared these two measures. Fig. 2 pre-
sents the Island of Montreal where the comparative analysis was
undertaken.
2.1. Description of data sources
2.1.1. NOx emissions
We developed a trafﬁc assignment model for the Montreal
region that is linked with an emission model capable of simulating
trafﬁc emissions occurring on the road network at the level of each
individual driver (Sider et al., 2013). The trafﬁc assignment model
(developed in the PTV VISUM platform; PTV Vision, 2009) allo-
cates vehicle ﬂows on the road network using data reﬂecting the
origins and destinations of individual/household trips in an urban
area. The model includes road types ranging from expressways to
local roads, with details regarding capacity, speed limits, inter-
section types, and turning restrictions. A dataset of daily travel
diaries from the 2008 Origin-Destination (OD) survey was used as
input to this model. This survey is conducted every ﬁve years in
Montreal by the Agence Metropolitaine de transport (AMT, 2008)
and contains information on travel behavior for 5% of the Montreal
region's households (which can be scaled up to the entire popu-
lation using sampling weights derived for each geographic sub-
area). Our trafﬁc assignment model was validated against trafﬁc
counts for the same year at 35 major intersections within the
region as well as ﬁve bridges linking the Island of Montreal with
the rest of the region. The comparison between actual counts vs.
predicted counts provides an R2 value for the 6–7 a.m. period of
0.78 and a R2 value for the 7–8 a.m. period of 0.65.
In addition, we developed a vehicle allocation algorithm (Sider
et al., 2013) to assign a speciﬁc vehicle to each driving trip in the
2008 OD survey (162,364 trips). Working at the household level,
the main elements involved with vehicle allocation are the num-
ber of vehicles owned by a household, each vehicle's time of
availability and geographic coordinates, as well as the vehicle type
distribution in the household's neighborhood (which we obtained
from the Quebec motor vehicle registry). The database that we
obtained from the provincial registry contains information on
vehicle age and type. Therefore, every driving trip in the OD survey
was allocated a vehicle type and model year that remained con-
stant over a day's worth of trips.
Our output includes trafﬁc ﬂow, average speed, and vehicle mix
on every road segment (intersection to intersection) in the region.
Using this output, we estimated emissions of nitrogen oxides
(NOx) at the level of every individual vehicle based on its type, age,
speed, and type of road it is circulating on (e.g. highway vs. arterial
road with intersections). Emissions were based on a multi-di-
mensional look-up table of emission factors in grams/vehicle.
kilometer that we generated using the Mobile Vehicle Emissions
Simulator (MOVES) platform developed by the United States En-
vironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) updated with Montreal-
speciﬁc data. Individual emission factors that accounted for ve-
hicle type, model year, speed, road type, and season (winter and
summer) were generated. In fact, our emission factors were based
on hourly temperatures and relative humidity. We also calculated
start emissions and these were a function of ambient conditions at
the time of starting the vehicle. A total of 4080 EFs were generated.
Total emissions on every roadway segment result from sum-
ming the individual emissions of all vehicles on that segment.
Because of randomness in the vehicle path choices (trafﬁc as-
signment) and vehicle type allocation, we ran the model ﬁve dif-
ferent times and used averaged emissions for every link. The
standard errors associated with the mean emissions are low

(approximately 1%) indicating that even though allocations may
vary drastically at the individual level, segment emissions over the
entire day (mean of 24 hourly outputs) remain relatively stable. In
this paper, we make use of the NOx emissions derived for summer
conditions that represent typical August temperatures and relative
humidity.
2.1.2. NO2 concentrations
We made use of estimates of concentrations of NO2, a marker of
trafﬁc-related air pollution, from a LUR model that we developed
and described previously (Crouse et al., 2009). The model was
based on data collected during a series of dense sampling cam-
paigns in 2005 and 2006 to estimate integrated two-week NO2
concentrations at individual points in space throughout the entire
island. Although we measured concentrations of NO2 over a
number of periods, in this paper, we are only making use of the
August 2006 campaign. During this campaign, two-sided Ogawa
passive samplers (Ogawa and Co., USA) were installed at a height
of 2.5 m near the sidewalk at 133 locations across Montreal. We
then generated a set of variables describing speciﬁc land use and
road density characteristics measured at different radial distances
away from the samplers (100, 300, 500 and 700 m). With these
variables, we developed a LUR model to predict concentrations of
NO2 where measurements were not taken. The resulting model,
using concentrations averaged over a two-week sampling period
in August, predicted 72% of the variability in NO2. The variables
selected for this model included area of commercial land-use, re-
sidential land-use, industrial land-use, parks and open water as
well as population and building density, length of primary high-
ways and major roads as well as their trafﬁc conditions and dis-
tances to shoreline, to National Pollutant Release Inventory Facility
(NPRI) and to primary highways. For each 5  5 m2 cell, we then
used the linear predictor coupled with the land use characteristics
of the cell to assign concentrations. The highest concentrations
were observed to occur along highways and major urban streets.
2.2. NO2–NOx comparison
Emissions of NOx (summer conditions) derived from the
transport model and concentrations of NO2 obtained from the LUR
model were compared over the entire Island of Montreal (Fig. 2).
The concentrations of NO2 represent integrated 2-week sampling
and the NOx emissions represent a sum of 24-h emissions. Al-
though emissions of NOx on the road network were available for
the entire metropolitan region, the LUR model was estimated only
for the Island, therefore restricting our analysis to this geographic
area.
While concentrations of NO2 were available from a raster-based
map at a resolution of 5 m  5 m, emissions of NOx were only
derived on the road network. In order to compare the two mea-
sures, the Island of Montreal was subdivided into a mesh of grid
cells each with dimensions 80 m  80 m amounting to a total of
approximately 75,000 grid cells. We allocated to each gridcell a
concentration of NO2 (in parts per billion, ppb) and a quantity of
NOx (in grams). For this purpose, buffers with a radius of 100 m
were drawn using the center of every gridcell; the total NOx
emissions generated on the roadway and falling within each buffer
were summed and allocated to adjacent gridcells. As such, grid-
cells located in areas with high street density, would receive a
larger amount of NOx emissions while gridcells located in regions
with low street density would receive little or no emissions.
In contrast, NO2 values per gridcell were estimated as the
average of the raster values. Different gridcell and buffer sizes
were tested and evaluated in terms of how they balanced the
following three objectives: 1) minimizing the standard deviation
in the NO2 values contributing to the average NO2 in each gridcell
(we observed that 80  80 m2 was the largest gridcell size which
achieved this objective), 2) maximizing the number of gridcells
with non-zero NOx (which led us to create the 100 m buffer that
slightly increases the amount of NOx in each gridcell while al-
lowing many gridcells to have a small NOx value rather than a 0),
and 3) avoiding a large gap in the NO2 and NOx spatial resolutions
(if we had generated larger buffer sizes, the NO2 and NOx would
represent very different areas of inﬂuence). Fig. 3 presents the
gridcells, buffers, and intersection with road network layer in a
small section of Montreal.
We compared the NOx emission load with the concentration of
NO2 in each gridcell. In addition, we conducted a comparison of
the NOx emission load with the measured NO2 concentration at
each of the 133 passive monitoring stations where ambient NO2
was measured in the development of the LUR model as an addi-
tional dimension to the validation of our NOx estimates.
We generated scatter plots of NOx vs. NO2 and we tested LOESS
smoothers with different spans varying from 1% to 75%. To com-
plement the scatter plots and further illustrate the relation be-
tween NO2 and NOx, we plotted the mean and median NOx within
each NO2 decile. In addition, we segmented the population of
gridcells (and monitoring stations) according to proximity to
roadways (using the total length of roads) and examined the cor-
relation between NOx and NO2 within each category.

every gridcell. All road segments intersecting a buffer contribute to the NOx emissions allocated to the gridcell. (For interpretation of the references to color in this ﬁgure

Finally, in order to map NO2 and NOx values in a way that al-
lowed us to visualize areas with stronger agreement between the
two measures, we categorized the 75,000 raw values of NOx and
NO2 into deciles and assigned to each gridcell the decile number
for NO2 and for NOx. In this respect, scaled NOx and NO2 values
ranged from 1 to 10, with 1 indicating the lowest decile. This
scaling allowed us to calculate scaled pollutant differences as NO2
minus NOx (ranging from 9 to þ9). These scaled differences are
referred to as the ‘indicator of agreement’. When the difference is
‘small’ (between 1 and þ1), NO2 and NOx values agree while
large negative differences indicate a much higher NOx value and
large positive differences indicate a much higher NO2 value. Using
the scaled difference values for each of the 75,000 polygons, we
generated an ‘agreement map’ highlighting the areas where the
two measures agree and areas with high disparities. This type of
scaling was only used to visually represent the data; it was not
used in subsequent statistical analyses. Finally, we computed the
mean and median NOx in each NO2 decile and observed their re-
lationship. In a recent study, Han et al. (2011) observed that the
correlation between NOx and NO2 near-roadway is different in the
daytime and night-time periods with better correlation during the
day indicating that integrated measures would mask these nuan-
ces. It is important to note that our transport model provides es-
timates of hourly NOx emissions throughout the day therefore
accounting for trafﬁc patterns and diurnal temperature changes.
2.3. Deriving exposures and associations with breast cancer and
prostate cancer
The estimated spatial emissions of NOx and concentrations of
NO2 were linked to the residences of 792 and 1722 participants in
the breast cancer and prostate cancer case–control studies, re-
spectively (Crouse et al., 2010; Parent et al., 2013). We ﬁrst com-
pared exposures for the study participants and regenerated the
comparative tests that were described in the previous sections to
evaluate whether the same relationships hold for the two samples
in the case–control studies.
We then estimated ORs for both cancers using estimates of NO2
and NOx by adopting the same methodology and covariates as the
original studies. For this purpose, an unconditional logistic re-
gression model was used to estimate ORs and associated 95% CI.
Each exposure measure was included as a continuous linear vari-
able (after verifying this assumption through the use of natural
cubic functions of the exposure–response curves). Different sets of
covariates were included in the two different cancer studies, and
these variables included the cancer-speciﬁc set of accepted and
suspected risk factors. All risk factors including descriptions of
cancer cases and controls are presented as supplementary mate-
rial. Covariates were included in the analysis in both forms of
linear and natural cubic spline functions. We presented ORs for an
increase across the interquartile range (IQR) of NO2 and NOx:
2.71 ppb and 481.37 g, respectively. The IQR is deﬁned based on
the exposures of subjects (cases and controls).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. NO2–NOx comparison
Table 1 describes the distribution of concentrations of NO2 and
NOx across the 75,000 gridcells; values of NO2 and NOx ranged
from 0 to 46.88 ppb and 0 to 21589.51 g respectively. Fig. 4a pre-
sents segment-level NOx emissions clearly showing that the most
emitting facilities are the major highways running across the city
as well as main arterial roads. The red and green lines in Fig. 4a
represent the segments with the highest and lowest emission le-
vels, respectively. NOx emissions were classiﬁed using ArcMap
based on natural data groups which are located between two
consecutive low points (valleys) in a histogram. As a result of this
technique, the differences between classes are maximized. Fig. 4b
presents the NO2 raster map generated using the August LUR
model for the same geographic area (Crouse et al., 2009). The
shades of gray refer to the NO2 concentrations with the highest
concentrations represented in the lightest shade and occurring
around the highways and in the downtown area. The scale of the
NO2 LUR map is inverted (highest concentrations in the lightest
shades) in order to better visualize the overlay between the NO2
map and NOx emissions on roads presented in Fig. 4c. Qualita-
tively, we can observe that road segments highlighted in bright
red and orange (which represent the highest emitting roads)
overlap with the light shaded areas on the NO2 map.
Using the NO2 and NOx levels for the 75,000 gridcells, we cal-
culated the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient to be 0.28 (95% CI:
0.27–0.29). Fig. 5 presents the scatterplot of NO2 vs. NOx and
LOESS smoother with a 1% span illustrating a non-linear re-
lationship between the two measures. The correlation between
simulated NOx and observed NO2 at the 133 monitoring stations
was also estimated; the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient was 0.45
(95% CI: 0.31–0.58). Fig. 6 presents the scatterplot and LOESS
smoother of 15% also illustrating a non-linear relationship.
These same relationships between NO2 and NOx across the
75,000 gridcells and at the 133 stations can also be visualized in
Figs. 7 and 8 where the mean and median NOx values are plotted
within each NO2 decile. We observed that the fastest increase in
mean NOx, occurs when NO2 concentrations are in the highest
deciles characterizing concentrations near roadways. Indeed, clo-
ser to the roadways, NOx emissions are highest since NOx emis-
sions are estimated only on the roads.
In order to investigate the effect of proximity to a roadway on
the relationship between NO2 and NOx, polygons were classiﬁed
according to the total lengths of roads (in meters) within their
buffer. Spearman correlation coefﬁcients were calculated in each
category. Fig. 9 shows that the correlation between NO2 and NOx
increases signiﬁcantly with the increase in the density of roads
within a polygon. For polygons affected by close to 1400 m of
roadways within their buffers, the correlation with NO2 is 0.85
while at road densities of about 400 m per polygon, the correlation
drops to less than 0.3. Fig. 10 illustrates that the same trend is
observed when comparing NOx with the NO2 concentrations at the
133 monitoring stations.

In order to spatially map NO2 and NOx values and using the
scaled difference values for each of the 75,000 polygons, we
generated an ‘agreement map’ highlighting the areas where the
two measures agree and areas with high disparities (Fig. 11). When
the difference is close to 0 (between 1 and þ1), it indicates a
good agreement between both measures. A large positive differ-
ence indicates that the NO2 scaled value is much higher (this is
expected to occur in areas with little roadways) while a large
negative difference indicates that the NOx value is larger (this is
expected to occur in the vicinity of roadways). Trafﬁc emissions of
NOx are the precursor to NO2 in urban areas. Therefore NO2 is high
where NOx emissions are high as well. Therefore closer to road-
ways, we expect that NO2 and NOx values are correlated because
the variation in NOx (due to a variation in trafﬁc volumes, speeds,
and composition) will be followed by a similar variation in NO2.
Far from the roadways, other sources of NO2 (albeit small) will
become more important. In this situation, we expect that the

transport/emission model will underestimate exposure. Fig. 11a
illustrates the frequency distribution of scaled pollutant differ-
ences across the 75,000 polygons. We observed that for 38.9% of
polygons, the agreement was between 1 and þ1. Similarly
Fig. 11b provides a map of the scaled difference for each polygon
across the Island of Montreal. It illustrates that the regions with
highest agreement are close to the roadways and within the
central areas of the city (highly populated) while regions with
positive scaled differences are far from roadways and regions with
negative scaled differences are very close to some roadways
whereby the NOx level per polygon would be extremely high. This
indicates a potential limitation of the NOx model which does not
include atmospheric dispersion therefore tending towards over-
estimating the contribution of trafﬁc to air pollution in the vicinity
of roads and underestimating air pollution away from roadways
(where
the
contribution
of
other
sources
becomes
more
important).
3.2. Differences in risk estimates obtained using the NOx model and
the summer LUR: examples from two case–control studies
Fig. 12 illustrates a ‘heat map’ representing the home locations
of the 792 breast cancer participants (cases and controls) over-
laying our ‘agreement map’. We observed that 34% of the partici-
pants lived in areas with scaled differences between both mea-
sures of 1, 0, and þ1 (indicating ‘reasonable agreement’) and
0.86% lived in areas where the scaled differences are 8 and 9
indicating close proximity to roadways. Fig. 13 shows that for 50%
of the participants, the Spearman correlation between NOx and
NO2 is 0.5 or higher (up to 0.9). Comparing this ﬁgure with Fig. 9
that presented the correlations for the entire domain based on
road length; we found that the road length in the buffers where
breast cancer subjects reside was higher. Similar results were
found for subjects from the prostate cancer study (data not
shown).
We estimated separate ORs using concentrations of NO2 and
emissions of NOx as measures of exposure, both for the breast
cancer and prostate cancer case–control studies. In total, 792 in-
dividuals were included in the breast cancer study and 1772
subjects were included in the prostate cancer analysis (including
both cases and controls). Table 2 shows that the odds ratios esti-
mated using the two exposure metrics differed between 5.2% and
8.8%, suggesting that wither method for estimated trafﬁc-related
pollution would produce similar estimates of risk.
We reiterate that the purpose of this analysis is not to show
whether there is an association for these limited exposure data, as
we have already published on these using the land use regression
models (Crouse et al., 2010; Parent et al., 2013), but rather whether
the estimates of risk are similar between the two types of ex-
posure measures.
4. Conclusions
Land use regression (LUR) techniques are generally used for
deriving exposure levels in epidemiologic studies of air pollution

and health effects. However, they often necessitate the deploy-
ment of large air quality sampling campaigns with extensive
spatial and temporal coverage. In this paper, we compared a
measure of exposure to trafﬁc-related air pollution generated by a
transportation model with NO2 concentrations derived from LUR.
We compared the measures of NO2 and NOx across the Montreal
Island as well as included a comparison of health risks associated
with these exposures.
Our results indicate reasonable agreement between the two
models in terms of the spatial distribution of emissions and air
quality. In addition, we observe that the two measures lead to
similar ORs for breast and prostate cancers. While this study
compares modeled concentrations of NO2 (ppb) to modeled
emissions of NOx (grams) a number of studies have used modeled
concentrations of NO2 and NOx at participants' home locations to
compare risk estimates. Using LUR-modeled NO2/NOx concentra-
tions and NOx derived from a simple Gaussian dispersion model,
Wu et al. (2011) found that the differences in the ORs for preterm
birth based on LUR output and dispersion model output vary be-
tween 50% and 77% (with the dispersion model output leading to
more attenuated ORs); an order of magnitude higher than the
difference we observed in this study. Andersen et al. (2011) used a
Cox proportional hazard model for obstructive pulmonary disease
in Denmark. In the fully adjusted model for age, smoking status,
duration, intensity, and environmental tobacco smoke, the authors
observed an OR of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.02–1.14) with a 35-year average
exposure to measured NO2 levels and 1.05 (95% CI: 1.01–1.10) with
a 35-year average exposure to measured NOx levels. In a study by

Chen et al. (2007) on the relation between lung cancer and mea-
sured NOx vs. NO2 concentrations, the authors found that among
trends of different air pollutants (including NOx, PM10, VOC, SO2,
Lead), the one with a pattern most similar to the trend in lung
cancer incidence was NOx.
The analysis we presented in this study sheds light on the use
of two different measures of exposure to trafﬁc-related air pollu-
tion. Our two measures are not perfectly correlated; while NOx
emissions from trafﬁc are highly correlated with near-road NO2
levels, in the absence of a dispersion model, we could be over or
underestimating the exposure to NOx emissions away from the
roadways. Similarly, LUR techniques are associated with a number
of uncertainties and highly depend on the diversity and density of
sampling locations. The differences in the ORs for breast and
prostate cancers using both measures are small.
