Traﬃc-related nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been traditionally estimated using surfaces generated
through land-use regression (LUR). Recently, air pollution dispersion has been used to derive NO2
exposures in urban areas. There is evidence that data collection protocols and modelling as-
sumptions can have a large eﬀect on the resulting NO2 spatial distribution. This study in-
vestigates the eﬀects of various NO2 surfaces on the risk estimates of postmenopausal breast
cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC), both of which have already been associated with traﬃc-
related air pollution. We derived exposures for individuals in two case control studies in
Montreal, Canada using four diﬀerent surfaces for NO2. Two of the surfaces were developed using
LUR but employed diﬀerent data collection protocols (LUR-1 and LUR-2), and the other two
surfaces were generated using dispersion modelling; one with a regional model (dispersion-1)
and another with a street canyon model (dispersion-2). Also, we estimated separate odds ratios
(ORs) using concentrations of NO2 as measures of exposure for both cancers. While the range of
NO2 concentrations from dispersion (4–26 ppb) was lower than the range from LUR (4–36 ppb),
the four surfaces were found to be moderately correlated, with Spearman correlation coeﬃcients
ranging from 0.76 to 0.88. The ORs for BC were estimated to be 1.26, 1.10, 1.07, and 1.05 based
on LUR-1, LUR-2, dispersion-1, and dispersion-2. In contrast, the ORs for PC were estimated to be
1.39, 1.30, 1.13, and 1.04 based on LUR-1, LUR-2, dispersion-1, and dispersion-2. The four ex-
posure measures indicated positive associations but we observed higher mean ORs based on the
LUR surfaces albeit with overlapping CIs. Since LUR models capture all sources of NO2 and
dispersion models only capture traﬃc emissions, it is possible that this diﬀerence is due to the
fact that non-road sources also contribute to the spatial distribution in NO2 concentrations.

traﬃc-related air pollution with increased incidence of asthma (Carlsten et al. 2010; Gehring et al. 2010; Snowden et al. 2014),
ischemic heart disease (Gan et al. 2011; Nyhan et al. 2014; Weichenthal et al. 2011), neurodegenerative diseases (Levesque et al.
2011; Wang et al. 2009), and various forms of cancer such as breast cancer (Crouse et al. 2010), prostate cancer (Parent et al. 2013),
and lung cancer (Hamra et al. 2015). In particular, exposure to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), an accepted marker of traﬃc-related air
pollution, has been associated with various health outcomes. For example, Chen et al. (2013) showed that a 5 ppb increase in NO2
exposure was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease. In a lung cancer study, Hamra et al.
(2015) estimated that a 10 μg/m3 increase in exposure to NO2 was associated with a 4% increase in the risk of lung cancer. In another
study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) conducted among 52,799 participants, the authors estimated that an increase
in the 35-year mean NO2 level by 5.8 μg/m3 was associated with an increased risk of COPD by 8% (Andersen et al., 2011).
Traditionally, NO2 exposure surfaces have been developed using land-use regression (LUR) models, whereby integrated NO2
measurements were conducted with passive samplers. Then, exposures were modelled at the home location of study participants
(Abernethy et al. 2013; Beelen et al. 2013; Dons et al. 2014; Hoek et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2014; Shekarrizfard et al. 2015). With
advances in air pollution instrumentation and improved knowledge of travel and activity patterns of individuals in urban areas, new
methods of deriving exposure have become possible. For example, the development of NO2 sensors has enabled the implementation
of short-term monitoring campaigns (Austin et al. 2006; Deville Cavellin et al. 2016; Setton et al. 2011) and personal measurements
(Mcadam et al., 2011; Pattinson et al. 2014) while improvements in travel demand forecasting and traﬃc modelling motivated the
development of traﬃc emission and dispersion models, capable of capturing the spatio-temporal variability in air pollution within
urban areas (Beckx et al. 2009; Hatzopoulou and Miller 2010; Shekarrizfard et al. 2017). LUR modelling necessitates the deployment
of large air quality sampling campaigns with extensive spatial and temporal coverage (Beelen et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2014; Levy et al.
2010).
As an alternative to statistical techniques, dispersion modelling involves constructing a dynamic model of the dispersion processes
occurring at the intra-urban scale. In this context, dispersion models capable of simulating air quality at the level of individual roads
are grouped into 3 main categories: 1) Gaussian dispersion models, which are typically used for areas without obstacles or with
obstacles of simple geometry; these models can be accurate at the top of the urban canopy and are mainly Gaussian plume and
Gaussian puﬀmodels (Cimorelli et al. 2005; Scire et al. 2000); 2) Street-canyon models, which are appropriate for cities with tall
buildings; they simulate pollutant transfer along the street and at intersections (Hertel and Berkowicz 1989; Soulhac et al. 2011); and
3) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models; they provide detailed representations of the atmospheric ﬂow and some also treat
the physics and chemistry of air pollutant transformations; they are however limited to local applications such as the impact of a
single pollution source in complex street geometry and ﬂow characteristics (Eichhorn and Kniﬀka 2010; Milliez and Carissimo 2007).
Dispersion modelling of road traﬃc sources has been conducted for a variety of road and network conﬁgurations (Batterman et al.
2010; Hatzopoulou and Miller 2010; Lee et al. 2009; Ning et al. 2005; Sangkapichai et al. 2010). Output from dispersion models has
been used in previous epidemiologic studies (Bellander et al. 2001; Gauderman et al., (2005); Henderson. et al., 2011; Nafstad et al.
2003; Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2010). For example, in a 27-year follow-up study, Nafstad et al. (2003) estimated NO2 concentrations
using sets of dispersion ﬁeld coeﬃcients given from model calculations for each year. The authors estimated 8% increase in the risk of
lung cancer (95% CI: 1.02–1.15) for a 10 μg/m3 increase in NO2 at the home address. Gauderman et al., (2005) used the CALINE4
dispersion model to estimate traﬃc-related NOx and estimated that with an increase in NO2 concentrations by 5.7 ppb, the odds ratio
(OR) for childhood asthma was 1.83 (95% CI: 1.04–3.21). Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (2010) used the OSPM dispersion model to
estimate traﬃc related NOx concentrations and estimated that the incidence rate ratios for lung cancer were 1.30 (95% CI: 1.07–1.57)
and 1.45 (95% CI, 1.12–1.88) for NOx concentrations of 30–72 μg/m3 and greater than 72 μg/m3, respectively. Furthermore, in a
case-control study of stillbirths, Ihrig et al. (1998) estimated arsenic exposure levels from airborne emissions using a dust dispersion
model in Texas and the OR observed for Hispanics in the high exposure group (> 100 µg/m3 arsenic) was 8.4. Henderson. et al.,
(2011) estimated smoke-related PM10 from the CALPUFF dispersion model and estimated the ORs for a 30 μg/m3 increase in tapered
element oscillating microbalance (TEOM)-based PM10 to be equal to 1.05 (95% CI: 1.03–1.06) for all respiratory physician visits, 1.16
(95% CI: 1.09–1.23) for asthma-speciﬁc visits, and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.00–1.29) for respiratory hospital admissions. Finally, Bellander
et al. (2001) estimated NO2 concentrations using the AIRVIRO dispersion model for all years spanning between 1955 and 1990 for the
entire Stockholm area and assigned the NO2 exposures to 10,800 geocoded addresses. They concluded that while this technique has
practical applications for epidemiological studies, it might be limited to study sites that possessed historical traﬃc and other emission
data.
The main strength of LUR is the use of monitoring data and the relative ease of model development. Dispersion models have the
advantage of incorporating both spatial and temporal variation of air pollution within a study area and can be applied at diﬀerent
spatial scales. Some of the limitations of these models include the assumptions about dispersion patterns (e.g., Gaussian dispersion),
the need for validation against monitoring stations, and relatively costly meteorological and emission data inputs (Jerrett et al. 2005).
A number of studies have compared the performance of LUR and dispersion modelling (Bell 2006; Briggs et al. 2000; Briggs et al.
1997; Cyrys et al. 2005; Dijkema et al. 2011; Hennig et al. 2016; Jerrett et al. 2005; Marshall et al. 2008; Wu et al. 2011). These
studies suggest that LUR models can explain the small-scale variations in air pollution concentrations as well or even better than most
dispersion models. Results, however, depend on the characteristics of the study area, the density of the monitoring, and the resolution
of the predictor variables. Beelen et al. (2010) compared the performance of high-resolution LUR and dispersion models in estimating
small-scale variations in NO2 concentrations and observed a moderate agreement between the estimated concentrations based on the
two methods. The dispersion model performed better than the LUR model with a correlation of 0.77 versus 0.47 against data from
ﬁxed stations. Marshall et al. (2008) used three approaches for estimating within-urban spatio-temporal variability in ambient
concentrations: (a) spatial interpolation of monitoring data (nearest and inverse distance weighted (IDW)), (b) LUR, and (c) a

Eulerian grid model (CMAQ). The authors found that LUR exhibited higher spatial variability compared to the other methods.
Correlations with data from ﬁxed monitoring stations were 76% and 71% for LUR and CMAQ, respectively. Wu et al. (2011)
compared diﬀerent exposure assessment methods in an adverse pregnancy outcome study in Los Angeles and Orange County. Ex-
posures were estimated at residential addresses using (a) the nearest ambient monitoring station, (b) LUR models, (c) a line source
dispersion model (CALINE4), and (d) a simple traﬃc-density measure. The eﬀect estimates were smaller for exposures based on
simpler traﬃc density measures and larger for LUR. More recently, Hennig et al. (2016) compared a dispersion model and a LUR
model in Germany noting that the agreement between the two models improved considerably after restricting the dispersion model to
local traﬃc only. Few other studies also compared the use of LUR and dispersion models for exposure assessment. Hoogh et al. (2014)
estimated NO2 exposures at residential locations and found that the dispersion model predicted a moderate to large proportion of the
measured variation in NO2 compared to the LUR model. Gulliver et al. (2011) however found that the LUR model performed
signiﬁcantly better than the dispersion model suggesting that LUR techniques provide robust methods for long-term exposure as-
sessment in epidemiology.
This paper compares four diﬀerent NO2 exposure surfaces developed for the City of Montreal. Two of the surfaces are based on
LUR models, one was developed using data from passive samplers (Crouse et al. 2009) and another was developed using data from
micro-sensors and short-term monitoring (Deville Cavellin et al. 2016). The other two surfaces were both developed based on
dispersion modelling; one surface was developed using a regional Gaussian puﬀdispersion model which can handle terrain eﬀects
and incorporates spatially reﬁned meteorology (Shekarrizfard et al. 2017), while the other is a street canyon dispersion model which
resolves near-road concentrations and ﬂow at road intersections (Fallah-Shorshani et al. 2017). Exposures for participants in breast
cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC) case-control studies were then derived in order to compare ORs from the four exposure
measures.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Development of exposure surfaces
2.1.1. Exposure surfaces based on dispersion models
Two diﬀerent models were adopted in order to disperse traﬃc emissions in Montreal (Fig. 1). Both models used emissions of
nitrogen oxides (NOx) estimated at the level of individual road segments and varying by time of day (Sider et al., 2013). In order to
generate estimates of on-road emissions, we used data from an origin-destination (OD) trip diary survey conducted during the fall of
2008 (a single day in October) for the Montreal metropolitan area. The 2008 OD data includes information for 5% of the Montreal
population with 66,000 households, 157,000 individuals, and 355,000 daily trips (Agence Metropolitaine De Transport (AMT)
(2008)). To estimate traﬃc volumes, driving trips (expanded up to the total population) were assigned on the road network using the
PTV VISUM platform (Vision 2009; DMTI, 2010). In addition, vehicle mix and average speed on every local and major road (127,217
road segments) were expressed. The model employs the stochastic user equilibrium approach (SUE) to assign trips onto the network.
Using output of the transportation model, we estimated emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with the Mobile Vehicle Emissions
Simulator (MOVES) platform developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) updated with Montreal-

speciﬁc data. Using information on vehicle type, model year, speed, road type, and season (winter and summer), individual emission
factors were generated. Fuel composition and ambient conditions within MOVES were replaced with Montreal-speciﬁc data. We
generated ﬂeet-wide emission factors (EFs) for NOx in g/veh km, varying by vehicle type (passenger car and passenger truck), age (30
model years), fuel (gasoline and diesel), road type (highway, arterial), and average speed (15 speed bins ranging from 2.5 mph
to > 65 mph). Finally, emissions of NOx were estimated at the level of every individual vehicle based on its type, age, speed, and type
of road. Total emissions on every road segment were computed by summing the individual emissions of all vehicles on that segment.
Hourly emissions for each road were used as input within two diﬀerent dispersion algorithms in order to simulate hourly NO2
concentrations. The ﬁrst dispersion model is a Gaussian model, based on the Lagrangian puﬀequation, which estimates the growth
diﬀusion and transport of released puﬀs in the modelling domain. The CALMET-CALPUFF modelling system was used to simulate
three-dimensional meteorology and NOx dispersion. We used the meteorological model CALMET to interpolate winds and tem-
peratures using higher-resolution terrain elevation, land-use, the ﬁfth-generation NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5), as well
as data from 10 surface stations. After generating the three-dimensional meteorology at a resolution of 1 × 1Km, we used the
dispersion model CALPUFF which shares the same modelling domain as CALMET. The domain extends 200 km × 140 km (1km ×
1km grids) centered on the Montreal Island (Shekarrizfard et al. 2017). The RIVAD chemical transformation scheme was applied to
transfer NOx to NO2. We used O3 concentrations as input to the model chemistry in order to transfer NOx to nitrate (NO3) and nitric
acid (HNO3). Furthermore, since part of NOx that transfers to smog in the presence of hydrocarbons varies with the NO2/NOx ratio, a
nonlinear regression equation between NO2/NOx ratio and NOx was used as input to the chemistry module. The 127,217 roads in
Greater Montreal were broken into smaller segments (less than 0.5 km) to increase the accuracy of road source modelling. A value of
3.5 m was considered for the initial vertical dispersion coeﬃcient (sigma z), therefore representing traﬃc-induced mixing near the
roadway. Hourly background NO2 concentrations were included, using data observed at the city of Montreal's monitoring station
number 99, located at the west tip of the Montreal Island. A detailed description of dispersion modelling is provided in Shekarrizfard
et al. (2017).
A street-canyon model (SIRANE), which is better suited at characterizing air pollution within the urban canopy, was also used.
The SIRANE model (Soulhac et al. 2011) is capable of simulating each street with a box model and calculates the corresponding
advective ﬂuxes balance at intersections. The street-canyon model SIRANE was used to calculate ambient NO2 concentrations using
the emissions of NO and NO2 derived from the traﬃc and emission models. SIRANE is an operational urban dispersion model that
adopts parametric relations for the pollutant transfer phenomena within and out of the urban canopy. This model provides the spatial
and temporal evolution of concentrations for diﬀerent pollutants, appropriate to the scale of a neighbourhood or a city (from few
hundred meters to about ten km). SIRANE accounts for three important transport mechanisms within the urban canopy to better
estimate the eﬀect of the complex street conﬁguration in an urban area including; a) advective mass transfer along the street due to
the average wind along its axis, b) turbulent mass transfer across the interface between the street and the overlying atmospheric
boundary layer, and c) advective transport at street intersections. Finally, it uses a Gaussian plume model to transport and disperse air
pollution above roof level and complete the simulation at street level. SIRANE assumes hourly meteorological data to be uniform
across the modelling domain in contrast to the sophisticated meteorological component of CALPUFF. The meteorological data cal-
culated for CALPUFF, were exported and used in the SIRANE model. Resolution of the SIRANE model is the same as CALPUFF
(1 × 1 km).
Throughout the remainder of the paper, we refer to the NO2 surface based on CALPUFF as Dispersion-1 while the surface based on
SIRANE is referred to as Dispersion-2.
2.1.2. Exposure surfaces based on LUR
We used two NO2 exposure surfaces for Montreal generated using LUR, developed by Crouse et al. (2009) (referred to as LUR-1)
and Deville Cavellin et al. (2016) (referred to as LUR-2).
Brieﬂy, Crouse et al. (2009) conducted a series of two-week sampling campaigns in 2005–2006 to estimate NO2 concentrations at
individual points throughout Montreal. Concentrations of NO2 were measured at a height of 2.5 m near the sidewalk at 133 locations
using two-sided Ogawa passive samplers (Ogawa and Co., USA) during three periods: i) November/December 2005, ii) April/May
2006 and iii) August 2006. A set of variables describing speciﬁc land-use and road density characteristics measured at diﬀerent radial
distances away from the samplers were generated (100, 300, 500 and 700 m). With these variables, a LUR model was developed to
predict the concentrations of NO2 where measurements were not taken (the model explained approximately 80% of the variability in
measured NO2 concentrations). The variables computed in LUR-1 model include land-use classiﬁcation (commercial, governmental/
institutional, open areas, parks/recreational, residential, resource/industrial and water body) and building footprint. In addition,
population density, number of NPRI (National Pollutant Release Inventory) locations emitting NOx, traﬃc counts, distance to the
shoreline, to the nearest highway, and to known point sources of NO2 (namely the 33 NPRI facilities) were considered. The output of
this model is a 5×5m raster-based NO2 map.
More recently, another LUR surface for NO2 was developed by Deville Cavellin et al. (2016). In this study, two data collection
campaigns were conducted: one spanning 10 weeks (between May and July of 2014) with 76 sites (visited three to eight times) and
another spanning 4 weeks in October of 2014 with 35 sites (visited four times each). The sites were visited randomly to have an equal
number of rush-hour and oﬀ-peak visits for each site. The sites were selected based on a population-weighted location-allocation
algorithm meant to represent high spatial variability in traﬃc intensity and in population density. Aeroqual S500 sensors were used
for this campaign. A LUR model was developed which explained approximately 86% of the variability in measured NO2 con-
centrations. The land-use variables included: number of bus stops and length of bus routes, number of intersections, number of NPRI
locations emitting NOx and volatile organic compounds, length of highways, length of major roads, total length of roads, distance to

roads, traﬃc on the roads, total population, area occupied by diﬀerent land-use types (commercial, governmental/institutional, open
areas, parks/recreational, residential, resource/industrial and water body), and building footprint. Additionally, distances between
the sites and potential sources of air pollution, major roads, highways, Montreal International Airport, port of Montreal, shore,
nearest rail line, and nearest NPRI locations were considered. The output of this model is a 100×100m raster-based NO2 map.
2.2. Comparison of exposure surfaces
Before comparing the surfaces, we validated each surface with data obtained from 9 reference monitoring stations in the city of
Montreal. In addition, we compared the observed NO2 concentrations at ﬁxed monitoring stations between the years 2006, 2008 and
2014 to capture the temporal variations among these years and to explain whether the diﬀerences among the surfaces could be due to
changes in NO2 concentrations over time.
While both LUR models were generated to represent a mean annual NO2 surface, dispersion models have the capability of
generating a surface for diﬀerent times of day (e.g., hourly). For comparative purposes, daily average concentrations based on
dispersion models were aggregated.
In order to compare the exposure surfaces generated using dispersion modelling against the Crouse et al. (2009) (LUR-1) and
Deville Cavellin et al. (2016) (LUR-2) surfaces, the island of Montreal was subdivided into a mesh and the four NO2 values (Dis-
persion-1, Dispersion-2, LUR-1, LUR-2) were allocated to gridcells of 1 × 1Km each. Pearson and Spearman correlations as well as
scatter plots were developed between pairs of surfaces. In addition, Bland-Altman plots were developed to assess the magnitude of
disagreement (including systematic diﬀerences) as well as identify outliers. Bland-Altman plots illustrate diﬀerences between pre-
dictions of two methods against their average (Bland and Altman, 1986). We also examined similarities between pairs of NO2 surfaces
using the intra-class correlation coeﬃcient (ICC), generated for each forward sorting area (FSA), which indicates the ﬁrst 3 digits of
the postal code. The ICC is a common metric for assessing agreement or consistency between two methods of measurement which
share the same observational units of sampling and/or measurement process. We made use of a two-way mixed-eﬀect variance model
to derive pairwise ICC with 95% conﬁdence interval.
2.3. Analysis of breast and prostate cancer case-control studies
Residences of 792 and 1,772 participants in the breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PC) case-control studies were linked to the
four NO2 surfaces at the same resolution of 1 km, using ArcGIS 10.4.1. We used BC and PC data from two case–control studies
conducted in Montreal, Quebec. A total of 377 BC incident cases were identiﬁed between 2008 and 2011 from all but one hospital
that treated breast cancer in the Montreal area. (Goldberg et al. 2017). Women were eligible if they fulﬁlled criteria for being
menopausal (i.e., the WHO criteria for menopausal status, accounting for hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, and bilateral
oophorectomy), were between 50 and 70 years of age, lived on the Island of Montreal, had never had a previous occurrence of any
type of cancer, and were registered with the universal Provincial Electoral List. Population controls (415 individuals) were identiﬁed
randomly from provincial electoral lists of Montreal residents and frequency-matched to cases using 5-year age groups. In the second
study, a population-based case-control study of incident prostate cancer during the years 2005–2009 was conducted (Parent et al.
2013; Blanc-Lapierre et al. 2015; Weichenthal et al. 2017). Men less than 76 years of age at the time of prostate cancer diagnosis were
selected from the main francophone hospitals that diagnose prostate cancer (802 cases). 968 control subjects were randomly selected
from the same districts as the case subjects and frequency-matched to cases in 5-year age groups. Control subjects were still eligible if
they had a history of cancer other than prostate cancer. In both studies, exposure to NO2 was associated with increased risks of BC and
PC after adjusting for other risk factors.
In the present study, we adopted the same methodology and covariates as the original studies to estimate the ORs for both cancers
using estimates of NO2 exposure. For this purpose, an unconditional logistic regression model was used to estimate ORs and asso-
ciated 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Each exposure measure was included as a continuous linear variable, after verifying this
assumption through the use of natural cubic functions of the exposure-response curves. Diﬀerent sets of covariates were included in
the two diﬀerent cancer studies, and these variables included the cancer-speciﬁc set of accepted and suspected risk factors, including
age at diagnosis, ﬁrst degree family history, education, family income, ethnicity, drinking and smoking status, body mass index, and
immigration status. Additional risk factors for BC included age at oophorectomy, age at menarche, oral contraception use, duration of
hormone replacement therapy use, total duration of breastfeeding, and age at ﬁrst full-term pregnancy. All risk factors including the
number of cancer cases and controls are presented as supplementary material. We included the covariates in the analysis in both
forms of linear and natural cubic spline functions. We present ORs for an increase across diﬀerent interquartile ranges (IQR) of NO2
for the four surfaces. The IQR is deﬁned based on the exposures of subjects (combination of cases and controls).
3. Results
3.1. Comparison of exposure surfaces
The predictions of the four surfaces were compared against NO2 data collected at a total of 9 ﬁxed-site air quality monitoring
stations managed and operated by the City of Montreal through the Reseau de Surveillance de la Qualite de l’Air (RSQA). Using the
predicted-observed pairs at each of the 9 stations, we computed the Pearson and Spearman correlation coeﬃcients for each surface.
The Pearson correlations between the observed and predicted values were 0.61 for Dispersion-1; 0.55 for Dispersion-2, 0.87 for LUR-

1 and 0.88 for LUR-2. The Spearman correlations were 0.78 for Dispersion-1; 0.67 for Dispersion-2, 0.92 for LUR-1 and 0.86 for LUR-
2. In addition, we plotted the average yearly NO2 concentrations at diﬀerent monitoring stations across the City of Montreal (Fig. 2).
At station 99 which is the background station, the NO2 concentration trend remained unchanged; the NO2 concentrations for 2006
and 2008 are similar and higher than 2014 levels at diﬀerent ﬁxed stations.
Figs. 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d present Dispersion-1, Dispersion-2, LUR-1 and LUR-2 surfaces, in this order, after converting all surfaces to
a 1 × 1Km resolution. Generally, the four surfaces pick-up on the higher concentrations occurring along main highways and closer to
the city center as well as the lower concentrations on the western tip of the island, located upwind of the prevailing winds. The
Dispersion-1 method (regional Gaussian puﬀdispersion model) tended to generate lower NO2 concentrations as compared to the
other methods; this is due to 1) the fact that the dispersion model only takes into account the contribution of traﬃc, and 2) the limited
capability of a Gaussian dispersion model to take into account the “trapping” eﬀects of buildings along urban streets. The NO2
concentrations generated using Dispersion-2 (a street canyon model which resolves the recirculation eﬀect in urban canyons) are
closer to LUR-1 and lower than LUR-2 values. LUR-2 (generated using micro-sensors) yielded the highest values. In fact, Deville
Cavellin et al. (2016) pointed out sensor oversensitivity when developing LUR-2.
The scatter plots in Fig. 4 illustrate a high agreement between the two dispersion surfaces and especially between the LUR surface

highest Spearman correlation with data from 1×1Km gridcells is 0.88 between the two dispersion surfaces followed by 0.85 between
LUR-1 and LUR-2 as well as between LUR-1 and Dispersion-2 (developed using the street canyon model). The lowest correlation is
0.76 between Dispersion-1 and LUR-2.

Finally, Fig. 6 presents the pairwise, ICC developed at the level of FSAs (ﬁrst 3-digit of postal code). A higher ICC is noted between
the Dispersion-2 and LUR-1 methods followed by Dispersion-1 and Dispersion-2, where 13.5% and 6% of FSA zones have ICC >
0.60. The lowest disagreement was found between Dispersion-1 (Gaussian model) and LUR-2 (based on micro-sensors) where 88 of
the 96 FSAs have an ICC of 0.20 and lower (A high ICC close to 1 indicates high similarity between values from the same group. A low
ICC close to zero means that values from the same group are dissimilar).
3.2. Analysis of exposure for subjects in BC and PC case-control studies
Fig. 7 shows the distribution of NO2 exposures for BC and PC subjects, respectively. There is a higher variability and range of
exposures based on the LUR models, compared with the dispersion models. As expected, exposures are highest based on LUR-2
(micro-sensors) and relatively similar for LUR-1 (passive samplers) and Dispersion-2 (street canyon model). Pairwise correlations
(Spearman) between exposures derived from the diﬀerent surfaces were generally similar to the correlations between the surfaces at
the level of gridcells (Table 1).
3.3. Estimates of risk for breast and prostate cancer
The fully-adjusted ORs for BC and PC for an increase in the IQR based on exposures derived from the four surfaces are presented in
Table 2. For BC, the lowest estimate of risk is 1.05 and the highest is 1.26. For PC, the lowest OR is equal to 1.04, and the highest 1.39.
These estimates indicate that despite the range in possible exposures, the association between exposure and the risk of BC or PC is
likely to be positive. For both BC and PC, the ORs based on the dispersion surfaces are lower than the ORs based on LUR surfaces. We
observed higher mean ORs based on the LUR surfaces but with overlapping CIs. Since LUR models capture all sources of NO2 and
dispersion models only capture traﬃc emissions, it is possible that this diﬀerence is due to the fact that non-road sources also
contribute to the spatial distribution in NO2 concentrations. Performance of the logistic regression for fully adjusted models are
presented in detail in the supplementary materials.

4. Discussion
The analysis we presented in this study sheds light on the use of four diﬀerent measures of exposure to traﬃc-related air pollution.
Our main objective was to compare the distribution of the spatial estimates of NO2 computed from two dispersion models to the
distribution of NO2 obtained from two LUR models. A secondary objective was to compare estimates of risk using these four exposure
estimates; in doing so, we exploited two case-control studies of cancer conducted previously. The main advantage of using air quality
models to derive exposure relates to their policy sensitivity, one could potentially evaluate the eﬀects of changes in land-use,
transportation infrastructure, and travel demand on traﬃc emissions and re-investigate the same associations with health outcomes.
We estimated separate ORs using concentrations of NO2 using the four surfaces as measures of exposure, both for the BC and PC
case-control studies. In total, 792 individuals were included in the BC study and 1722 subjects were included in the PC study
(including both cases and controls). Results show that the risk estimates using the two LUR exposure surfaces were between 10–26%
for BC and 30–39% for PC which were higher than the risk estimates generated by the dispersion surfaces (5–7% for BC and 4–13%
for PC).
To the extent to which dispersion models incorporate robust algorithms able to capture the temporal and spatial variability in NO2
concentrations, our surfaces do not include estimates of truck emissions and industrial sources, leading to lower concentrations
compared to the LUR surfaces. As a result, part of the diﬀerences in ORs between the dispersion and LUR models are due to the lack of
these emission sources in dispersion modelling. The diﬀerences between the two dispersion surfaces are mostly attributable to the
nature of the two models and chemical transformation processes. We also note systematic diﬀerences in measurements between
passive samplers and low-cost sensors. Areas with lower ICCs and higher disagreement between each pair of surfaces were mostly
located near the downtown and denser areas. The areas of higher agreement were most likely aﬀected by lower emissions from
traﬃc, and are located west of the island which includes typical suburban developments with lower building and population density
than the inner city core. It is also important to note that we compared two dispersion surfaces obtained from 2008 traﬃc data against
two LUR surfaces based on 2006 and 2013 monitoring campaigns.
The present study ﬁlls a gap in the existing literature by comparing the methods that are often used to derive air pollution
exposure in epidemiological studies (Bell 2006; Hennig et al. 2016). Various studies compared spatial interpolation methods (e.g.,
kriging, IDW and nearest monitor) with LUR techniques (Brauer et al. 2008) and only few of them compared spatial interpolation
methods with atmospheric dispersion models (Bell 2006; Hennig et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2011). In addition, this study illustrates the
eﬀects of using each of the four diﬀerent measures of exposure on the increased risk of two cancers, previously associated with
exposure to traﬃc related air pollution.
Application of these diﬀerent approaches leads to diﬀerences in exposure estimation and interpretation due to the speciﬁc
characteristics of each method. Bell (2006) found that air quality modelling systems may be able to provide better estimates of
exposure than monitoring alone. Wu et al. (2011) compared eﬀect estimates for traﬃc-related air pollution exposure surfaces and
preterm birth using monitoring stations, LUR and dispersion surfaces in Los Angeles and Orange County. They observed that the size
of eﬀect estimates was smaller for exposures based on measurements compared to more reﬁned exposure assessment methods.
Similar to our study, Henning et al. (2016) found that the agreement between a chemical transport model and a LUR model was weak
to moderate and that LUR models estimate more stable long-term exposures to local, mostly traﬃc-related air pollution with respect
to very small-scale spatial variations.
In this study, the four modelling approaches were found to reﬂect slightly diﬀerent spatial variations in NO2 concentrations,
however the surfaces based on the two dispersion models and LUR models were highly correlated. Additionally, for all four surfaces,
we found a positive association with the increase in NO2 concentrations and risk of breast and prostate cancers, but we observed
higher ORs using the LUR exposure surfaces.
The higher ORs associated with the LUR surfaces indicate that the surfaces based on the dispersion models have led to potential
misclassiﬁcation in the exposure estimates, thus leading to lower estimates of risk. Indeed, by examining the distributions of ex-
posures associated with the home locations of participants based on the four surfaces, we observe that the range and variability in
exposures is higher with LUR models than dispersion models. This is an indication that the LUR models are able to better capture the
intra-urban variability in NO2 concentrations and to better express the range of exposures in an urban area.
