### ABSTRACT


Testicular cancer is rare and accounts for 1% of all cancers in men,
but it has public health significance because it is the most common
cancer among men aged 15 to 40 (1). The risk of testicular cancer has
increased over the last four decades and the most significant increase
has been among Caucasian men in Nordic countries (2). The incidence
rates in Nordic countries (primarily Caucasians) is 11.5 per 100,000
men, whereas those among Black and Asian men are 1 to 2 per
100,000 (3, 4). There are two main types of testicular cancer, germ
cell and non–germ cell tumors (5). Germ cell tumors are derived from
multi-potential germ cells, mainly teratomas, and seminoma, and
account for 97% of all testicular cancers, whereas non–germ cell
tumors are derived from testis’ support cells and represent 3% of all
testicular cancers. The testicular cancer patient often presents with
either painless enlargement of testis or symptoms related to metastases

such as hemoptysis from lung deposits or endocrine effects such as
gynecomastia. Due to recent advances in diagnosis and treatment
options, the prognosis of testicular cancer is very good, even after
metastases (6).
The main known risk factor for developing testicular cancers is
cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis; testicular cancer
risk increases five to 10 times among men born with cryptorchidism as
compared to others (7, 8). Other risk factors include Klinefelter
syndrome, which is the most common sex chromosome abnormality
in which the affected male carries an additional X chromosome (9).
This additional X chromosome results in hypogonadism and an
increased risk of testicular cancer (10). Family history of testicular
cancer among first-degree relatives (father and brothers; refs. 11–13),
Caucasian men (14), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (15), body height (16), and a history of inguinal hernia (17) are
other established risk factors of testicular cancer.
Increasing incidence rates of testicular cancer over the last four
decades suggests that environmental exposure and lifestyle have an
essential role in the testis cancer etiology. The increasing incidence of
testicular cancer among young adults also suggests that early-life
exposure may be important for disease development. Swedish and
Danish second-generation immigrant studies reported testicular cancer risk to be similar to the country of residence and not that of their
parents (18, 19), which also points at environmental and or lifestyle as
important for testis cancer etiology. Nevertheless, no prior study has
investigated a possible link between ambient air pollution exposure
and the risk of testicular cancer.
Several animal and human studies have investigated the effect of air
pollution exposure as a hormone disruptor (20) and on male infertility (21), and both hormone disruptors and male infertility can
increase the risk of testicular cancer (22). Human studies analyzing
presence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in blood samples of young

males reported a significant association with testicular cancer (23–25).
Fetal exposure to pollutants, especially those that can act as hormone
disruptors and mimic the estrogen effect, can increase the risk of germ
cell tumors (26). Diesel exhaust particles encompass various substances with estrogenic and antiandrogen properties, and exposure,
especially during fetal life, can increase the risk of testicular cancer in
mice (27). Occupational and residential exposure to pollutants with
hormone disrupter characteristics have shown mixed results. Occupational exposure to 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-ethylene (28) and residential
exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (23) was associated with
increase the risk of testicular germ cell cancer, but other studies did
not show similar results (29, 30).
Exposure to ambient air pollution has been negatively associated
with sperm morphology in animal and human studies (31). A respirable fraction of particulate matter can act as a transporter for proven
endocrine disruptor polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (32), which
can negatively affect spermatogenesis directly or via the hypothalamicpituitary axis (33) but a further link with an increased risk of testicular
cancer has not been established. Long-term exposure to air pollution,
specifically nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter
(PM), can trigger oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory reactions (34). Long-term high level of oxidative stress can results in low
sperm quality and quantity via lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, and
oxidation of proteins in spermatozoa (35). Testicular cancer risk is
high among men with abnormal semen characteristics (36).
Based on the previous observations of air pollutants with hormone
disrupting characteristics and causing oxidative stress and chronic
inflammation, we hypothesized that air pollution is associated with the
incidence of testicular cancer. The aim of the present study was to
investigate if outdoor air pollution at the residence is associated with
the risk of testicular cancer.

## Materials and Methods


Study population
We conducted a register-based matched case–control study based
on the entire Danish population. We identified all patients diagnosed
with testicular cancer between 1989 and 2014, aged 20 years or older at
the time of diagnosis, and without a previous cancer diagnosis,
including a previous testicular cancer, in the Danish Cancer Registry (37); we accepted a previous diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin
cancer. We used the International Classification of Diseases 10
(ICD-10) codes C62.0–C62.9 to identify testicular cancer patients.
Four age-matched (year/month of birth) controls, free of previous
cancer diagnosis (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), and alive at the
date of diagnosis of their cases (index date), were randomly selected
and matched to each case. Controls were selected from all eligible male
individuals in the Danish Civil Registration System (38).

Exposure assessment
Using the unique 10-digit identification numbers, we extracted all
the study participants’ residential addresses from January 1, 1979, to
December 31, 2014, from the Danish Civil Registration System (38).
Geographical coordinates at the residential address’s front door were
attained using municipality code, street, and house number. All
addresses were geocoded within 5 m from the front door using the
Danish address database. We estimated the annual mean concentration of PM2.5, PM2.5 constituents, NO2, O3, and sulphur dioxide (SO2)
using the high-resolution multiscale air pollution model system
DEHM/UBM/AirGIS. The DEHM/UBM/AirGIS model was
described in detail previously (39).


Air Pollution Exposure and Risk of Testicular Cancer

In summary, DEHM/UBM/AirGIS combines three models to
estimate air pollution levels at a location: (i) The Danish Eulerian
Hemispheric Model (DEHM), which calculates regional background
concentrations due to long-range transport (40, 41). DEHM estimates
both natural and anthropogenic emissions of gases and particles and
their precursors. DEHM uses a 3D large-scale chemistry transport
model with a spatial resolution of 5.6 km � 5.6 km to estimate regional
long-range transport. DEHM also estimates chemical reactions, atmospheric transport, and dispersion of pollutants and the deduction
processes in the atmosphere, such as transport dispersion and deposition. DEHM models the primary particles [mineral dust, black
carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and sea-salt], the secondary
inorganic aerosols (SIA) including ammonium (NH4), sulphate (SO4),
and nitrate (NO3) in their different chemical forms, and the secondary
organic aerosols (SOA) generated from gaseous organic precursors
such as volatile organic compounds (VOC), isoprene, etc.; (ii) The
Urban Background Model (UBM) uses the SPREAD emission model (42) to estimates contribution from an urban area (39, 43–45) using
an average building cover and height for a 1 km � 1 km resolution over
Denmark. The UBM estimates the local urban emissions of NOx and
primarily emitted particles originating from all sources (e.g., traffic and
residential heating) and also takes into account the regional background concentrations modeled with DEHM (46, 47); and (iii) The
Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM), which models local air
pollution levels using traffic intensity, speed, and distribution of
vehicle types to calculates contributions from the local traffic in the
address street (48). The OSPM also accounts for the detailed information on the street and geometry of buildings surrounding the
street (49). OSPM estimates air pollution at a 2-m height at addresses
in streets with 500 or more vehicles per day. Comparisons between
model predictions and measured concentrations show correlation
coefficients between 0.62 and 0.92 for the different pollutants (Supplementary Materials and Methods, text 1). We refer to the Supplementary Materials and Methods for more details about the air pollution model system concerning sources of uncertainty, spatial resolution, and main sources of the pollutants.
We used the average concentrations of air pollutants weighted by
the time living at each address during the relevant period. We
calculated such time-weighted averages (TWA) of air pollution concentrations over four time periods: the 1 year before birth, the first
10 years of life, 10 to 20 years before the index date (10 years lag), and
the last 10 years before the index date. Participants with missing
exposure information for 20% or more of the relevant exposure time
window were excluded from the final analysis. For periods with
missing exposure for less than 20% of the time, the TWA was
calculated for the period with known exposure.

Potential confounders
Using the 10-digit unique personal identification number (PIN;
ref. 39), information on potential confounders, both at individual and
parish levels, was extracted from the registries of Statistics Denmark.
The individual-level data included marital status (cohabiting,
divorced, and never married), disposable income (calendar year
specific quantiles), and attachment to the labor market (blue-collar,
lower white-collar, higher white-collar, unemployed, retired). Sociodemographic data were also retrieved at the parish level from Statistics
Denmark. We obtained yearly data for the proportion of households
living in rented dwellings, the proportion of inhabitants with a manual
profession, and the proportion of inhabitants with disposable income
in the lower quintile. In 2017, in Denmark, 2160 parishes existed with
an average area of 16.2 km[2] (range 0.1–126.2) and a median number of

1,032 inhabitants (range approximately 33–36,000). We used individual and parish level values corresponding to 1 year before the index
date to minimize the risk of prediagnostic symptoms influencing
sociodemographic variables. We selected the sociodemographic factors based on availability and also because these factors might captures
variation in (unknown) environmental/societal factors, whichcould be
responsible for changes in testicular cancer incidence rates. We also
extracted health data to identify individuals with HIV infection, born
with cryptorchidism, or any congenital malformation of male genital.

Statistical analysis
We used conditional logistic regression analyses to assess the
associations between exposure to different pollutants and testicular
cancer and estimated ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We
adjust for potential confounders in three �a priori determined models:
Model 1 adjusted for age and calendar time by the matched design;
model 2 further adjusted for individual-level characteristics, including
cohabiting status, disposable income, and attachment to the labor
market. model 3 (our main model) further adjusted for manual labor,
income, and homeownership at the neighborhood level. Results for all
three models are given in the supplementary materials and methods;
due to minor differences in results for the three models we present only
results from model 3 in the manuscript text. We performed analysis for
TWA exposures of all pollutants over four time periods: the 1 year
before birth, the first 10 years of life, 10 to 20 years before the index date
(10 years lag), and the last 10 years before index date. We also analyzed
if the risk differs for older (≥36 years) and younger (≤35 years) age
group testicular cancer patients because the incidence rates for testicular cancer is higher for the age group 20 to 35 years than for those
35þ years indicating that different etiologies might be in play; we
tested a possible interaction by introducing an interaction term with a
dichotomous variable indicating the age group. We tested deviation
from linearity by comparing a decile model with a linear model
using the likelihood ratio test; the P values ranged between 0.13 and
0.68 indicating no deviation from linearity based on the “last 10year” exposure time window; thus, we fitted linear models. The
uncertainty of the exposure model might have been higher in the
early period (supplementary materials and methods). Therefore, we
estimated risk for testicular cancer for those diagnosed 1989–1999
and 2000–2014 separately. All statistical analyses were performed in
R version 3.2.1.

## Results

We identified 6,941 eligible cases and 22,594 eligible age-matched
controls for the analysis of exposure during the last 10 years before
diagnosis. We excluded cases (n ¼ 105) and controls (n ¼ 103) with
history of cryptorchidism, cases (n ¼ 10) and controls (n ¼ 7) born
with congenital malformation of male genital, cases (n ¼ 34)
and controls (n ¼ 52) with a history of HIV. We further excluded
cases (n ¼ 305) and controls (n ¼ 1,618) with missing exposure
information for more than 20% of the 10 years preceding index date,
and cases (n ¼ 74) and controls (n ¼ 261) with a missing value for
any covariate. Finally, after the above exclusions, we excluded cases
(n ¼ 23) and controls (n ¼ 1,556) for whom no matched case or control
was available resulting in 6,390 cases and 18,997 matched controls


for analysis of exposure during the last 10 years before diagnosis
(Supplementary Table S1).
Table 1 shows sociodemographic characteristics of cases and
controls. Over 60% of the study population was aged 40 or below;
income, marital status, and attachment to the labor market were
similar between cases and controls. Study participants’ area-level
sociodemographic characteristics were also similar for cases and
controls. The 10-year TWA concentrations of pollutants were
similar among cases and controls with a mean exposure among
controls of 21.75 mg/m[3] for NO2, 13.63 mg/m[3] for SO2, 58.99 mg/m[3]

O3, 18.20 mg/m[3] for PM2.5, 0.85 mg/m[3] for BC, 1.51 mg/m[3] for OC,
0.31 mg/m[3] for SOA, 8.34 mg/m[3] for SIA, 1.52 mg/m[3] for NH4,
3.71 mg/m[3] for NO3, 3.11 mg/m[3] for SO4, and 4.10 mg/m[3] for sea-salt
(Table 2; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Spearman correlation coefficients between air pollutants among
controls are reported in Supplementary Table S2 and shows that
PM2.5 was strongly correlated with secondary inorganic aerosols
(Rs ¼ 0.94) and its constituents NH4 (Rs ¼ 0.87), NO3 (Rs ¼
0.90), SO4 (Rs ¼ 0.94), and SO2 (Rs ¼ 0.95). O3 was negatively
associated with NO2 (Rs ¼ �0.98), BC(Rs ¼ �0.91), OC(Rs ¼ �0.84),
PM2.5 (Rs ¼ �0.54), SOA (Rs ¼ �0.61), SIA (Rs ¼ �0.28), and its
constituents.
Table 3 shows associations between risk for testicular cancer and
exposure to air pollution during four different time windows. ORs in
association with exposure during the last 10 years before diagnosis
were close to 1.00 and with CIs spanning 1.00 (Table 3); adjustment
had minor influence on these ORs (Supplementary Table SS3). The
results were similar for those diagnosed between 1989 and 1999 and
2000 and 2014 (Supplementary Table SS4), and for exposure during 10
to 20 years before diagnosis (10-y lag; Table 3). Table 3 also shows that
exposure during the year preceding birth was associated with ORs
for NO2 of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77–0.97) per 10 mg/m[3] and for OC of 0.84
(95% CI, 0.72–0.98) per 1 mg/m[3]. Exposure during the first 10 years
of life was associated with ORs for OC of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.67–0.93) per
1 mg/m[3], for O3 of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.07–1.34) per 10 mg/m[3], and for SIA
of 1.07 (95% CI, 1.00–1.15) per 1 mg/m[3].
The primarily emitted carbonaceous particles showed higher ORs
in association with testicular cancer in the older (> ¼ 36 years) than
in the younger age group (< ¼ 35 years); ORs for OC were
1.20 among the older and 0.90 among the younger (P for interaction
between OC exposure and age group: 0.05). For the other air
pollutants, the confidence intervals around the ORs for the younger
and older age groups widely overlapped (Table 4). Supplementary
Fig. S2 shows spline plots of associations between air pollution and
risk for testicular cancer.

## Discussion


In this large population-based case–control study, we found no
overall association between outdoor air pollution at the residence the
last decades before the diagnosis and the risk of testicular cancer.
Exposure to NO2 and OC the year before birth and the first 10 years of
life wasassociated with lower riskof testicular cancerwhereas exposure
to O3 and SIA during the first 10 years of lift was associated with a
higher risk of testicular cancer. Exposure to OC during the last 10 years
before the diagnosis was associated with higher risk for testicular
cancer diagnosed after 35 years of age.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate a
possible association between residential outdoor air pollution and the
incidence of testicular cancer. Second-generation immigrant studies
from Denmark (19) and Finland (50) reported similar testicular cancer

risk to the country of residence. In contrast, the first-generation
immigrants maintained the risk of testicular cancer observed in their
country of origin. Thus, environmental factors might play a role in the
etiology of testicular cancer. Our study indicates that if air pollution
plays a role, early exposure (first 10 years of life) to primary air
pollution from local sources (indicated by NO2, BC, and OC) might
be associated with a lower risk for testicular cancer whereas early
exposure to secondary pollutants (indicated by O3 and SIA) might be
associated with a higher risk. Late exposure (last 10 years before
diagnosis) to OC might be associated with higher risk for testicular
cancer among those diagnosed after age 35 but not among those
diagnosed at younger ages. These results were based on multiple
analyses of combinations of pollutant, exposure time window, and
age group and we cannot exclude that they are a result of chance. It
seems counterintuitive that exposure tosome air pollutants reduces the
risk of testicular cancer, which speaks against a causal interpretation of
our findings for early exposure to primary air pollution from local
sources. Since this is the first study on air pollution and risk of testicular
cancer, a comparison with the results of future studies would qualify
the interpretation of our findings.
We modeled air pollution, which is inevitable associated with some
degree of exposure misclassification. However, the DEHM/UBM/
AirGIS air pollution modeling system used in our study has been
successfully validated and predicts both temporal and geographical


variation in air pollution well (Supplementary Materials and Methods;
refs. 41, 50). We would expect that the model predicts air pollution
more precisely in the later than in the early period (Supplementary
Materials and Methods), but the results for cases diagnosed between
1989 and 1999 were similar to those for cases diagnosed between 2000
and 2014. We were unable to assess air pollution exposure at locations
other than the residential address, such as occupational exposure,
during commuting or indoors. We would expect the inevitable misclassification to be nondifferential and, therefore, it might have moved
the risk estimates towards null.
Our study’s major strengths include use of the virtually complete
and reliable nation-wide Danish registries providing a nearly perfect
frame for case identification, control selection, and identification of
present and historical addresses. It was a strength of the study to
identify and exclude cases and controls with a history of cryptorchidism, born with congenital malformation of male genitals, and Klinefelter syndrome. These conditions are well-established risk factors
for testicular cancer. We cannot exclude that air pollution would affect
the risk for testicular cancer differently among those with and without
these condition and we excluded individuals with the conditions to
avoid their potential influence on our risk estimates. We were also able
to restrict our cases and controls to individuals with no prior history of
cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer); this further minimized risk
of bias related to cancer therapy or change in lifestyle after a cancer

Denmark, which ensured information about full residential history.
We had no information about individual level factors such as
smoking, diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, body weight,
and occupational exposure. None of these, however, are established
risk factor for testicular cancer, but should they be risk factors and
should they be associated with air pollution as well, then confounding


from such factors cannot be excluded. We could not account for family
history of testicular cancer, in utero exposure to estrogen, and history
of inguinal hernia. In utero exposure to estrogen is a rare condition and
occurs during unplanned pregnancy when the expecting mother uses
oral contraceptive. Oral contraceptive, in a real-life condition of use, it
is about 92% effective (51); still, only a small proportion of the few
women getting pregnant while using oral contraceptives are likely to

bNumbers differ from the 6,390 cases and 18,997 controls included in the analyses of exposure during the last 10 years before diagnosis. That is because our exposure
assessment started in 1979, which left “early” cases without information about exposure. For example, for exposure during the year before birth, participants born
prior to 1980 were excluded (5,710 cases; 17,187 controls). In addition, participants with missing exposure more than 20% of the year preceding birth were excluded
(20 cases; 74 controls).

give birth. Thus, any bias due to this is probably very small. Inguinal
hernia can increase testicular cancer risk (52) but in Denmark, all
residents have universal, free access to health care, making it unlikely
that such operation is associated with air pollution.
Air pollution concentrations in Denmark are relatively low when
compared with many other European countries, and not least when
compared with many cities in developing countries. We cannot
exclude that associations which were undetected in our study,
would exist and be detectable in populations exposed to higher air
pollution levels.

Conclusion
We found that early life exposure to NO2 and OC was associated
with lower risk for testicular cancer whereas early life exposure to O3
and SIA was associated with higher risk. Exposure to OC during the
last 10 years before diagnosis was associated with higher risk for
testicular cancer diagnosed after age 35. These findings might be due to
chance and need replication in future studies.
