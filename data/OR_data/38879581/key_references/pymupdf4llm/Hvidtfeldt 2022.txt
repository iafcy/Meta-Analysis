**1. Introduction**


METHODS: We pooled six European cohorts (N = 302,493) to assess the association of residential exposure to
fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), warm season ozone (O3) and eight elemental
components of PM2.5 (copper, iron, potassium, nickel, sulfur, silicon, vanadium, and zinc) with cancer of the
kidney parenchyma. The main exposure model was developed for year 2010. We defined kidney parenchyma
cancer according to the International Classification of Diseases 9th and 10th Revision codes 189.0 and C64. We
applied Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for potential confounders at the individual and area-level.
RESULTS: The participants were followed from baseline (1985–2005) to 2011–2015. A total of 847 cases
occurred during 5,497,514 person-years of follow-up (average 18.2 years). Median (5–95%) exposure levels of
NO2, PM2.5, BC and O3 were 24.1 μg/m[3 ](12.8–39.2), 15.3 μg/m[3 ](8.6–19.2), 1.6 10[−] [5 ]m[−] [1 ](0.7–2.1), and 87.0
μg/m[3 ](70.3–97.4), respectively. The results of the fully adjusted linear analyses showed a hazard ratio (HR) of
1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.92, 1.15) per 10 μg/m[3 ]NO2, 1.04 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.21) per 5 μg/m[3 ]PM2.5,
0.99 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.11) per 0.5 10[−] [5 ]m[−] [1 ]BCE, and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.02) per 10 μg/m[3 ]O3. We did not find
associations between any of the elemental components of PM2.5 and cancer of the kidney parenchyma.
CONCLUSION: We did not observe an association between long-term ambient air pollution exposure and incidence
of kidney parenchyma cancer.


Cancers of the kidney are a large societal burden considering both
the incidence and relatively high risk of metastatic advance (Gupta
et al., 2008; Safiri et al., 2020). The incidence has increased over the past
decades and globally more than 400,000 new cases of kidney cancers are
now registered each year and close to 180,000 annual deaths (Sung
et al., 2021). The majority of kidney cancer cases (>90%) develop in the
kidney parenchyma and are mainly adenocarcinomas (renal cell
carcinomas).
The etiology of kidney cancer is largely unknown (Scelo and Larose,
2018). The incidence is higher in males (Sung et al., 2021) and espe­
cially obesity is considered an important risk factor for the development
of kidney cancer (Wang and Xu, 2014). Other established risk factors
include tobacco smoking (Hunt et al., 2005), high blood pressure
(Weikert et al., 2008), chronic kidney disease, and diabetes (Gelfond
et al., 2018; Larsson and Wolk, 2011). Alcohol consumption has been
found to be related to a decrease in risk of kidney cancer, likely through
a pathway of increased insulin sensitivity (Scelo and Larose, 2018).
Certain environmental and occupational exposures have also been
linked with the development of kidney cancers. The most convincing
evidence is found for exposure to trichloroethylene, which is used in
industry as a metal cleaner (Karami et al., 2012), but arsenic in drinking
water and pesticides are also possible environmental risk factors (Kar­
ami et al., 2008; Saint-Jacques et al., 2018).
Particulate matter (PM) air pollution is classified as a group 1 human
carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
mainly based on the pool of evidence in relation to lung cancer (IARC,
2016). The mechanisms by which air pollution may induce cancer
include inflammation and oxidative stress, which are both considered
key elements in the development and progression of cancer (Straif et al.,
2013). When inhaled, PM exerts DNA damage, promotion of cell turn­
over, and lung tissue proliferation and beyond the respiratory tract by
entering the blood circulation through absorption, metabolism, and
distribution of inhaled carcinogens (Chen et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2021).
Also, epigenetic modifications and telomere shortenings are suggested
mechanisms linking air pollution to cancer (Saini et al., 2019). Evidence
from experimental studies of human tissue and animal models propose
that particles in diesel exhaust induce oxidative stress, inflammation,
and DNA damage in kidney cells (Nemmar et al., 2016; Waly et al.,
2013).
The influence of outdoor air pollution on kidney cancer has been
investigated in previous studies. In the large European Study of Cohorts
for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) meta-analysis, based on 14 European
cohorts and 697 incident kidney parenchyma cases, a hazard ratio (HR)
of 1.57 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81, 3.01) per increment of 5 μg/
m[3 ]PM with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 μm (PM2.5) and a HR of
1.36 (95% CI: 0.84, 2.19) per 10[−] [5 ]m[−] [1 ]PM2.5 absorbance (a measure of
soot) was reported (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2017). An ecological study


based on the U.S. cancer registry, including more than 250,000 incident
kidney cancer cases in the period 1992–2016, showed a higher incidence
rate ratio with higher exposure to PM2.5 (Coleman et al., 2020). The
results, however, were sensitive to the choice of exposure model, with
weaker associations observed when applying a time-dependent exposure
model. The most recently published systematic review, including twenty
articles (four case-control, nine cohort, and seven ecologic studies)
concluded that the evidence for a causal link between ambient air
pollution exposure and kidney cancer so far is limited due to large
heterogeneity between studies in terms of study design, exposure met­
rics and confounder models (Zare Sakhvidi et al., 2020).
In this large-scale pooled analysis study of six European cohorts in
the framework of the Effects of Low-Level Air Pollution: a Study in
Europe (ELAPSE) - a large consortium building on the ESCAPE collab­
oration - we aim to assess the relationship between long-term air
pollution exposure and kidney parenchyma cancer incidence. In addi­
tion to PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), and ozone
(O3), we include eight specific elemental PM2.5 components. We add to
the findings of the previous ESCAPE publication through a longer
follow-up and a newly developed Europe-wide spatial land-use regres­
sion model.

**2. Methods**

_2.1. Study population_

The study included the following six cohorts from the ELAPSE
collaboration, which had information on kidney parenchyma cancer
incidence: Cardiovascular Effects of Air Pollution and Noise in Stock­
holm (CEANS) - which is the collective name of four sub-cohorts
(Stockholm Screening Across the Lifespan Twin study [SALT] (Mag­
nusson et al., 2013); Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in
Kungsholmen [SNAC-K] (Lagergren et al., 2004); The Stockholm Dia­
betes Prevention Programme [SDPP] (Eriksson et al., 2008); and The
Stockholm Cohort of 60-year-olds [Sixty]) (W¨andell et al., 2007); The
Danish Nurse Cohort (DNC) (Hundrup et al., 2012); The Danish Diet,
Cancer and Health cohort (DCH) (Tjønneland et al., 2007); the Dutch
European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-NL) comprising the two sub-cohorts EPIC-Monitoring Project on Risk Factors
and Chronic Diseases in the Netherlands (EPIC-MORGEN) and (EPI­
C-Prospect) (Beulens et al., 2010); the Etude Epid´emiologique aupr`es de
femmes de la Mutuelle G´en´erale de l’Education Nationale (E3N/EPIC-­
France) (Clavel-Chapelon, 2015); and the Austrian Vorarlberg Health
Monitoring and Prevention Programme (VHM&PP) (Ulmer et al., 2007).
All cohorts except the DNC were part of the ESCAPE collaboration. The
baseline varied between 1985 and 2005 across the cohorts with follow
up until 2011–2015. Data from all cohorts were pooled and stored on a
secure server in Utrecht University. All six cohorts had baseline infor­
mation on age, sex, marital status, employment status, smoking status,


-----

amount and duration of smoking in current smokers (E3N and VHM&PP
only in classes), body mass index (BMI), and area-level socio-economic
status (SES). These variables were harmonized across the individual
cohorts. We have reported details on each included cohort previously
(Hvidtfeldt et al., 2021).
We included all participants without any previous cancer at baseline
(with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancer).

_2.2. Exposure assessment_

The exposure model and validation of NO2, PM2.5, BC, O3, and PM2.5
components has been described in detail elsewhere (Chen et al., 2020;
de Hoogh et al., 2018). In brief, we applied Europe-wide hybrid land use
regression (LUR) models which incorporated the following air pollution
predictors: monitoring data, satellite observations, model estimates,
land use, road variables, and industrial point sources (Eeftens et al.,
2012). The development of BC and PM2.5 composition applied ESCAPE
monitoring data from 2009 to 2010, and therefore we selected year 2010
as the primary exposure modelling year. In exposure model validation
by five-fold Hold Out Validation (HOV) in random subsets (20%) of the
monitoring datasets, stratified by site type (background, traffic) and
region of Europe, a large fraction of measured spatial variation in the
annual average concentration in HOV was explained (e.g. 59% for NO2,
72% for PM2.5, 54% for BC, and 69% for O3 average concentration in the
warm season) (de Hoogh et al., 2018). We used supervised linear
regression (SLR) and random forest (RF) algorithms for the PM
composition models and included eight components, which represented
major air pollution sources: copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zink (Zn)
(non-tailpipe traffic emissions, e.g. brake and tyre wear), silicon (Si)
(crustal material), sulfur (S) (secondary inorganic aerosols from
long-range transported sulfur containing fuel combustion), nickel (Ni)
and vanadium (V) (mixed oil burning/industry emissions), and potas­
sium (K) (biomass burning) (Chen et al., 2020). For all exposures, we
applied models for 2010 to create surfaces (100 m × 100 m grid reso­
lution) and linked these to the cohort members’ baseline residential
address. The SLR and RF models explained within-area variability
similarly (Chen et al., 2020), and we therefore interpret associations
with exposures from the two models equally. We truncated negative
(SLR) PM component predictions to zero and a small number of unre­
alistically high predictions at close distance to industrial sources to a
maximum modelled concentration for each element (Waly et al., 2013).
No truncation was needed for the RF-modelled exposures.

_2.3. Outcome_

We followed the cohort participants in national cancer registries,
death certificates, or medical records - except for the E3N cohort where
self-reports from biannual questionnaires or death certificates were
applied. This information was confirmed in pathological reports and
reviewed by an oncologist. We defined kidney parenchyma cancer ac­
cording to the International Classification of Diseases and Related
Health Problems, 9th and 10th Revision (ICD-9/ICD-10) codes 189.0
and C64, respectively.

_2.4. Statistical analysis_

We used Cox proportional hazards models with age as the underlying
time scale and censored each participant at time of first occurrence of
any cancer other than kidney parenchyma cancer, date of death,
emigration, loss to follow-up, or at the end of follow-up. We modelled
NO2, PM2.5, BC, and O3 in the warm season (O3) as a linear function with
increments of 10 μg/m[3], 5 μg/m[3], 0.5 10[−] [5 ] m[−] [1 ] and 10 μg/m[3],
respectively, and the PM components with increments of 5 ng/m[3 ] Cu,
100 ng/m[3 ]Fe, 50 ng/m[3 ]K, 1 ng/m[3 ]Ni, 200 ng/m[3 ]S, 100 ng/m[3 ]Si, 2
ng/m[3 ] V, and 10 ng/m[3 ] Zn. We included strata per individual (sub)
cohort in order to account for baseline hazard heterogeneity between


the (sub) cohorts and to relax the assumption of proportional hazards.
We modelled the association between the air pollutants and kidney
parenchyma cancer incidence in three models: 1) accounting for age
(underlying time-scale), sex and (sub) cohort ID (strata), and adjustment
for baseline year; 2) further adjusted for individual-level covariates
employment status (yes vs. no), marital status (married/cohabiting,
divorced, widowed, single), BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24, 25–29, and 30+ kg/
m[2]), smoking status (never, former, current), smoking duration (years of
smoking), and smoking intensity (cigarettes/day); 3) further adjusted
for area-level socio-economic status (SES) defined as mean income in
2001. The spatial scale of the area varied from smaller neighborhoods
and city districts (CEANS, EPIC-NL, E3N) to municipalities (DNS, DCH,
and VHM&PP). We excluded participants with incomplete information
on model 3 variables from all analyses. We assessed the shape of the
concentration-response function by natural cubic splines (3 degrees of
freedom) and performed subset analyses for PM2.5, NO2, BC and O3
exposures by restricting the main Model 3 analyses to participants with
exposure levels below specific cut-off values.
We performed the following sensitivity analyses: 1) Addressing po­
tential effect measure modification between the main exposures and sex
(replacing the strata term with an interaction term with air pollutants),
smoking status, and BMI (three categories of <25, 25–29, and 30+ kg/
m[2]), by including an interaction term in the model tested by the Wald
test. 2) Investigating the impact of alcohol consumption (linear term,
excluding CEANS Sixty and SNAC-K and the VHM&PP), educational
level (three categories, excluding the VHM&PP cohort), and occupa­
tional status (white collar/blue collar, excluding the DCH, E3N, and
EPIC-NL cohorts) by comparing estimates in identical data subsets with
and without adjustment. 3) Exploring other exposure definitions of NO2,
PM2.5, BC, and O3 by (a) back-extrapolating to the baseline address, (b)
time-varying exposure extrapolated across the address history from
baseline to end of follow-up in cohorts with this information (excluding
DNC and E3N), and (c) applying the local LUR exposure models devel­
oped for ESCAPE (excluding DNC, E3N and parts of DCH which were not
included in ESCAPE). We specified a 1-year calendar time-period strata
to handle time-trends in air pollution and kidney parenchyma cancers.
The extrapolation used air pollution concentrations estimated from the
Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) regional air pollution
model, including hourly values of chemical species, which are averaged
into monthly concentrations across Europe at a 26 km × 26 km spatial
resolution (Brandt et al., 2012). We applied these trends to calculate
annual average concentrations for all years from baseline to end of
follow-up, allowing different spatial trends within Europe. We per­
formed back-extrapolation by using the absolute difference and the ratio
between the baseline period and 2010.4) Two-pollutant models were
conducted by adjustment for the second pollutant to test the sensitivity
of the estimates of one pollutant to inclusion of another. 5) We excluded
one cohort at a time to assess the impact of individual cohorts on the
effect estimates.
We investigated any violation of the proportional hazards assump­
tion of the Cox Models for all covariates by test of a non-zero slope in a
generalized linear regression of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals on time.
All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.0.

**3. Results**

After initial exclusions - primarily due to cancer before baseline,
missing exposure, and missing covariates (17.7%), the pooled study
population included 302,493 individuals and 847 cases of kidney pa­
renchyma cancer during 5,497,514 person-years of follow-up (Table 1).
The participants’ baseline ranged from 1985 to 2005 with a mean age
from 41.7 to 72.5 years across the individual cohorts and a pooled mean
of 48.2 (standard deviation, SD: 13.4) years. Four of the cohorts
included women only and the pooled cohort included 66% women. The
percentage of overweight or obese participants varied from 21% in the
French E3N cohort to 65% in the Swedish SIXTY cohort. The baseline

percentage of married or cohabiting participants was 72 in the pooled
cohort, ranging from 46% to 84%, and unemployment ranged from 76%
to 5% with a pooled percentage of 29. The percentage of baseline cur­
rent smokers varied from 13% to 37% with a pooled percentage of 24.
We generally observed lower mean levels of PM2.5, NO2 and BC in
northern compared to more southern cohorts (Figure A.1), and mean O3
levels were highest in the French and Austrian cohorts. The exposure
distribution of each PM2.5 component according to individual cohort is
provided in Figure A.2. In general, the concentrations were lower in
Northern compared to Southern cohorts - with the exception of PM2.5 Ni,
Si, and V. For NO2, BC, Cu, Fe, and Si the within-cohort exposure
contrast was large and less so for PM2.5, O3, K, Ni, S, V, and Zn. The
exposures derived by SLR and RF were mostly similar, however, with
large differences in individual cohorts and a smaller within-cohort
exposure contrast for RF-modelled exposures compared to SLR.
In most of the cohorts, exposure to PM2.5 was moderately to highly
correlated with exposure to NO2 and BC (Table A.1). The correlation
between PM2.5 and O3 was generally moderately negative but varied
substantially between the cohorts. Also, the correlations of PM2.5 com­
ponents with PM2.5 mass and NO2 varied greatly from low to moderate
across the cohorts (Tables S2 and S3). The correlations between specific
PM2.5 components varied markedly across individual cohorts


(Table A.4).
The results of the fully adjusted linear analyses (Model 3) showed a
HR of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.15) per 10 μg/m[3 ]NO2, a HR of 1.04 (95% CI:
0.88, 1.21) per 5 μg/m[3 ]PM2.5, a HR of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.11) per 0.5
10[−] [5 ]m[−] [1 ]BCE, and a HR of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.02) per 10 μg/m[3 ]O3
(Table 2). The estimates of the three models of increasing adjustment
were similar. The natural cubic splines with 3 degrees of freedom indi­
cated a linear increase in the exposure-response function at the low end
of the exposure range for NO2, PM2.5, and BC (Fig. 1). However, we
observed an indication of a decreasing trend at the end of the exposure
range with very wide CI’s. The results for PM2.5 components are pro­
vided in Fig. 2 and supplement Figure A.3, and these showed elevated
risks in association with PM2.5 Ni, S and especially Si estimated with SLR
models. For PM components estimated by the RF-model, slightly
elevated HRs were observed for Cu, Ni, and V. Especially the HRs based
on exposures derived by the RF algorithm had very wide confidence
bounds due to a smaller variability of the elemental components.
Analyses of subsets of the data showed a higher risk for kidney cancer
when restricting to NO2 concentrations below 20 μg/m[3 ](HR 1.20; 95%
CI: 0.75, 1.91), PM2.5 concentrations below 15 μg/m[3 ](HR 1.31; 95% CI:
0.89, 1.94), and BC concentrations below 1.5 10[−] [5 ]m[−] [1 ](HR 1.45; 95%
CI: 1.12, 1.89) (Table A.5). We found no clear indications of effect

measure modification (Table A.6). The effect for NO2 and BC was higher
for smokers compared to ex- and never-smokers, whereas the opposite
was true for PM2.5. The results were also stable in the additional analysis
adjusting for alcohol consumption, educational level, and occupational
class in a pooled cohort including the cohorts with the available infor­
mation (Table A.7). Back-extrapolation of the exposures to the baseline
address of cohort members did not affect the estimates notably
(Table A.8). The results of the time-varying analysis, taking into account
the residential history of participants, resulted in effect estimates for
NO2, PM2.5, and BC below 1, and a HR just above unity for O3 compared
to the main model 2010 exposure. We observed a moderate to high
correlation between the ELAPSE air pollution exposure concentrations
and the local study area specific LUR models from ESCAPE in all cohorts
except CEANS (Figure A.4). The contrast in NO2 exposure did not vary
markedly for ELAPSE compared to ESCAPE, whereas for BC exposure the
contrast was generally larger for the ELAPSE compared to the ESCAPE
exposure. For PM2.5, the contrast varied across the cohorts. For DCH,


EPIC_NL, and VHM&PP the contrast was larger for the ELAPSE exposure
compared to ESCAPE, while ESCAPE exposure had a larger exposure
contrast in the CEANS cohort. The HR for BC in relation to kidney cancer
was similar in analyses based on the ESCAPE LUR model compared to
the ELAPSE exposure model in the cohorts and individuals for which
both exposure models were available (Table A.9). For PM2.5 and NO2 the
effect estimates were higher when based on the ELAPSE compared to the
ESCAPE exposure model (1.04 [95% CI: 0.87; 1.24] vs. 0.96 [95% CI:
0.83; 1.10] for NO2 and 1.01 [95% CI: 0.80; 1.29] vs. 0.91 [95% CI:
0.62; 1.33] for PM2.5). However with both exposure methods, no indi­
cation of an association was found.
The results of the two-pollutant models are provided in Figures A.5
and A.6. Generally, the estimates remained stable after adjustment for
co-pollutants, but estimates for NO2 and BC were sensitive to mutual
adjustment. The results were generally unaffected by exclusion of indi­
vidual cohorts (Figure A.7). We detected deviation from the propor­
tional hazards assumption for employment status. A sensitivity analysis

**4. Discussion**

In this pooled study of more than 300,000 individuals across Europe,
we did not observe an increased risk of kidney parenchyma cancer in
association with long-term air pollution exposures of NO2, PM2.5, BC,
O3, or elemental components of PM2.5.
Our effect estimates differ from those reported in the ESCAPE anal­
ysis in which higher risks were reported with higher exposure to PM2.5
and PM2.5 absorbance, with HRs of 1.57 (95% CI: 0.81, 3.01) per
increment of 5 μg/m[3 ]PM2.5 and 1.36 (95% CI: 0.84, 2.19) per 10[−] [5 ]m[−] [1 ]

PM2.5 absorbance (BC proxy) (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The CI’s
in both studies do, however, widely overlap. The current study builds on
the ESCAPE collaboration, with some differences, which may explain
the differential results. First, we performed a pooled analysis as opposed
to a meta-analysis of individual study effect estimates. However, since
we used a stratum term in the current analysis, we also primarily
exploited exposure contrasts within cohorts. Second, in the current
study we used a longer follow-up resulting in a larger number of cases of
kidney parenchyma cancer. Consistently, confidence intervals were
much narrower in the current analysis. In addition, we applied an
improved exposure model incorporating outputs from chemical trans­
port models and satellite data. Also, the observed difference may in part
be due to differential inclusion of cohorts, although our analysis
excluding single cohorts, did not suggest the results to be particularly
sensitive to such heterogeneity. The cohorts from ESCAPE were selected
based on the air pollution levels and willingness to pool data and a
relatively recent recruitment date. The ELAPSE project specifically aims
to investigate health effects of low-level air pollution. Of the ESCAPE
cohorts included in the original Kidney cancer study, the Turin cohort
was dropped for not contributing to analysis of low level air pollution,
EPIC Varese was excluded because of missing information on individual
SES data, and EPIC Umeå and San Sebastian because they did not
include assessment of particles. The Oslo-based HUBRO study and the
English EPIC-Oxford study were initially included, but both studies were
unable to transfer data because internal procedures took much longer
owing to unforeseen changes in privacy regulations. However, the two
cohorts providing the largest number of cases (VHM and DCH) were
included in both analyses. Of the 697 cases in the ESCAPE study, 538 are
included in the present study. The spline and subset analyses suggest an
association with kidney cancer for NO2, PM2.5, and BC for the lowest
exposure levels – these mainly include the Scandinavian study areas.
The steeper slope at lower exposure levels was also found for other
endpoints in ELAPSE, including mortality (Strak et al., 2021). We cannot
disentangle whether the steeper slope was related to the exposure level
per se or other characteristics of the cohorts experiencing those exposure
levels.
The few other published studies on air pollution and kidney cancers
generally report elevated risk estimates with higher exposure to PM2.5
(Zare Sakhvidi et al., 2020). An Italian study based on 196 incident cases
of kidney cancer reported a HR of 1.24 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.29) and 1.20
(95% CI: 1.07, 1.33) per increments of 10 μg/m[3 ] PM2.5 and NO2,
respectively (Gandini et al., 2018). The results were stronger for rural
areas (2005 mean PM2.5 of 20.9 μg/m[3]) compared to urban (24.5 μg/m[3])
and metropolitan (32.5 μg/m[3]). The study was based on a crude expo­
sure assignment (municipality-level) of each participant. In the Amer­
ican Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II cohort, PM2.5 exposure
was found to be associated with kidney cancer mortality with a HR of
1.14 per 4.4 μg/m[3 ](95% CI: 1.03, 1.27) (Turner et al., 2017). The study
was based on hybrid LUR exposure assigned to the residential address of
623,048 participants and a total of 927 kidney cancer deaths (mean
PM2.5 12.6 μg/m[3]). Given the relatively high 5-year survival rate of


kidney cancers, the mortality end point does not reflect disease inci­
dence very well. We have not been able to identify previous studies
concerning exposure to PM constituents and kidney cancer risk.
Strengths of the present study include the large sample size gained
through pooling data from six European cohorts and the detailed in­
formation on important covariates, which were harmonized specifically
for the ELAPSE project. The cohorts covered a large part of Europe and
the large sample size enabled two-pollutant models to disentangle po­
tential inter-dependencies between pollutants as well as analyses of
interaction. The findings, however, were sensitive to mutual adjustment
of NO2 and BC - probably as a consequence of high correlations between
these two pollutants in some cohorts (Table A.1). Comparable exposure
estimates for the entire study population were ensured by applying
hybrid air pollution models developed centrally for the ELAPSE
collaboration. The exposure model was, however, developed based on
year 2010 measurements, which represent exposure towards the end of
the follow-up period. The back-extrapolated analysis performed to
investigate the potential exposure misclassification as a consequence of
this approach yielded stable results. Previous European studies have
reported the spatial distribution of NO2, black smoke, and traffic in­
tensities to be historically stable (Beelen et al., 2007; Cesaroni et al.,
2012; Gulliver et al., 2011), and the applied 2010-model has shown high
correlations with models developed for 2000 and 2005 (2013 for PM2.5)
(de Hoogh et al., 2018). We did not have available data on time-trends of
PM2.5 components to perform back-extrapolated analyses, and therefore
we are not able to exclude the possibility that the spatial contrast has
been less stable over time for the elemental components. In addition,
applying a model for exposure assignment unavoidably imposes
misclassification because of uncertainties in input data and due to the
fact that exposure modelled at the residential address does not cover the
true personal exposure. Our results were generally stable across the
three models of increasing confounder adjustment and the adjustment
for occupational class and educational level in sensitivity analyses.
However, residual confounding from e.g. occupational exposures or
cumulative smoking dose cannot be excluded. Also, we cannot rule out
the possibility of residual spatial confounding, however, adjustment for
area-level income did not affect the effect estimates. The individual
cohorts might differ according to underlying risk of kidney parenchyma
cancer as a consequence of such unmeasured factors, but the analyses
were stratified by cohort in order to account for differences in baseline
hazards. Lastly, censoring at the time of any other cancer event than
renal cancer might bias the results toward the null by ignoring potential
renal cancer outcome data that comes to clinical attention after a
separate cancer. However, the risk for the cancer under investigation
very likely changes (in an unpredictable way) when diagnosed with
another cancer. Hence, the potential bias cannot be evaluated.
The findings of this study were based on a pool of cohorts collected
from across Europe, which were selected to represent areas in the lower
exposure range. Thus, the results might not be generalized to pop­
ulations exposed to higher levels of air pollution.
In conclusion, our study does not provide further evidence of a role of
air pollution in the development of kidney parenchyma cancers.
