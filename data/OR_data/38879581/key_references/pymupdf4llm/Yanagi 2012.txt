## Introduction

Various studies [1,2,3] have shown an association
between air pollution and its effects on human
health, even with low levels of pollutants. The
effects are seen in overall mortality and specific
areas such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and cancer [4,5,6].
The broad term “particulate matter” (PM)
includes a class of pollutants consisting of solid
and liquid material that can remain suspended
in the atmosphere due to their small size. Inhalable particles have an aerodynamic diameter less
than 10µm. Finer particles (less than 2.5µm) can
reach the pulmonary alveoli, while larger particles (from 2.5 to 10µm) are retained in the upper
airways.
PM is considered the most efficient transporter of air pollutants into the body [7].
The presence of carcinogenic agents in the
air pollution mix could partially explain why air
pollutants increase the risk of lung cancer and
possibly that of other cancers [8]. Cancer risk in a
given population depends directly on the latter’s
biological and behavioral characteristics as well
as the surrounding social, environmental, political, and economic conditions. This understanding is essential for determining investments in
risk assessment research and effective prevention measures [9].
Cancer is a greatly feared disease worldwide.
Much of the fear stems from the lack of effec

-----

tive treatment for inoperable metastatic tumors.
However, recent decades have witnessed progress in therapies and surgical techniques, thus
increasing patient survival [10].
Studies on exposure to risk factors are useful for a more comprehensive view of cancer
etiology [11]. The two most important methods
to identify the effects of pollution on health are
epidemiological investigations and experimental
studies [12].
The city of São Paulo, Brazil, internationally
known from the economic, political, and social
points of view, suffers increasingly from problems with gargantuan traffic jams and thus increasing air pollution. The city is divided into 96
administrative districts.
Cancer incidence and mortality in the city of
São Paulo has shown a similar pattern to that of
developed countries. According to Mirra et al. [13],
this pattern may relate to several factors such
as the growth of more elderly age groups, improved socioeconomic conditions in the region,
and possibly also a drop in the fertility and infant
mortality rates.
Environmental changes caused by humans
and lifestyle changes may lead to different types
of cancer.
According to the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (Instituto Nacional de Câncer –
INCA) [14], approximately 80% of all cancer cases
in Brazil are associated with environmental factors involving the general environment (water,
land, and air), occupational environment (factories and similar industrial facilities), consumption (food and medicines), and social and cultural environment (lifestyle and habits).
The principal carcinogenic agents from environmental pollution include byproducts of incomplete burning of fossil fuels, especially diesel.
Air pollution is formed by a variable and complex
mixture of these compounds [8].
The realization that cancer is a nationwide
public health problem in Brazil led to the formulation and implementation of actions, plans, and
programs targeting control of the disease, including improvement and expansion of the specialized network of medical and hospital care and
early detection measures. Preventive measures
include health promotion and intervention in
cancer risk factors. An important component in
the response to this national challenge is knowledge on the incidence and mortality related to
the principal forms of cancer, as well as prevalence of exposure to risk factors [15].
Thus, due to the theme’s public health relevance, the current study aimed to assess the
impact of air pollution on cancer incidence and
mortality in the city of São Paulo.


## Methods

This was an ecological time series study. In ecological studies, the unit of analysis is a population
or group of persons that generally belongs to a
defined geographic area, such as a country, state,
or city [16].
Incidence and mortality for each type of cancer in the districts with air quality monitoring
were correlated with PM10 values using Pearson’s
correlation coefficient, considering a time lag of 0
to 17 years, also verifying the p-value as the measure of statistical significance. The correlation coefficient (r) was considered high if 0.60 < r < 0.80 [17]
and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
Relative risks (RR) were also calculated for
the period in each administrative district, for the
incidence and mortality of the types of cancer
with the highest statistical correlation coefficient
with PM10. Relative risks were calculated using
SaTScan, version 8.0 (http:\\www.satscan.org,
USA) as the ratio between the number of observed
cases for each sex and age bracket according to
World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in
each district and the number of expected cases
for each, according to the population’s composition by sex and age brackets. The reference rate
was calculated based on the total number of cases in the city, by sex and age bracket, for the study
period and was used for calculating the expected
number of cases.
The cartographic rendering of these results
allows analyzing spatial risk distribution. Cartographic representation used the choropleth technique since it indicated for depicting rates, proportions, or indices. According to this technique,
the increasing order of relative values grouped
in significant classes is transcribed by a correspondingly increasing visual order [18].
The division of class intervals on the maps
was done by standardized discretization. This
technique uses the mean and standard deviation
of the series of values, allowing comparison between different maps. The point of departure was
the elaboration of the histogram and calculation
of the mean, median, mode, and asymmetry coefficient. Since most of the series of relative risk
values displayed marked asymmetry, the values
were log-transformed before discretization to approach normal distribution. The class intervals
in the original values were obtained from the reciprocal function of the initial function, in this
case the common logarithm, namely 10[x]. The
mean was used as the center or class limit and
the standard deviation to calculate the range of
classes above and below the mean. Cartographic
representation was elaborated with the software
Philcarto v5.5 (http://philcarto.free.fr).

Data on particulate matter (PM10)

Considering the long-term effect of pollution on
health, the mean annual PM10 levels were obtained for the years 1988 to 1997. These data were
furnished by the São Paulo State Environmental
Company (Companhia Ambiental do Estado de
São Paulo – CETESB), which monitors the air quality in some districts of the city of São Paulo: Brás,
Santana, Moóca, Cambuci, Moema, Freguesia do
Ó, Campo Belo, Lapa, Consolação, Santo Amaro,
and São Miguel.
An important factor in air pollutant monitoring systems is data quality control based on the
adoption of criteria for representativeness. When
the data from a given air quality monitoring station and in a given period present measurement
flaws, the results may be jeopardized. According
to the CETESB [19], in order for the annual mean
PM10 to be considered representative, the station should present half of the valid means for
the four-month periods of January-April, MayAugust, and September-December. In the year
1995, the monitoring stations located in the districts of Santana, Cambuci, Moema, Campo Belo,
and Santo Amaro failed to meet this criterion.
In 1996, among the selected districts, no station
that measured PM10 met the criterion for data
representativeness.

Epidemiological and demographic data

We analyzed the most frequent types of cancer
and those that caused the most deaths in the

Table 1


city of São Paulo: skin, breast, prostate, bladder,
stomach, rectum, uterine cervix, esophagus, colon, larynx, thyroid, and lung, selected according
to the International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology (ICD-O) [20]. Cancer data were collected
from the São Paulo Cancer Registry for the years
1997 to 2005 for incidence and 1997 to 2004 for
mortality [13]. Data for 2005 were not considered
for mortality, since they were not consolidated
according to this parameter for the study’s data
collection period. The dataset included 36,534
cases and 12,934 deaths.
Incidence and mortality rates were calculated
based on the population per administrative district of the city for 1997 to 2005, estimated by the
Foundation of the São Paulo State Data Analysis
System (Fundação Sistema Estadual de Análise
de Dados – SEADE Foundation).
The São Paulo Cancer Registry adopts quality control indices suggested by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and INCA.
IARC is part of the WHO, and its work involves
coordinating research on the causes of human
cancer, mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and the
development of scientific strategies for cancer
prevention and control. Table 1 shows the quality
indices obtained by the São Paulo Cancer Registry for the period from 1997 to 2005, compared to
the indices suggested by IARC and INCA.
According to the suggested quality control
indices, only diagnoses based on histocytological examinations were considered. Notifications
based only on the death certificate should not
exceed 20% of the reported cases, since such
notifications indicate that the diagnosis was not
made until after death. Delay in diagnosis of the
disease can also be observed when there is an unspecified primary site, which should be less than
10% in order to guarantee the dataset’s quality.
The mortality/incidence ratio may indicate lack

of notification of the disease. The rate of missing data for age may indicate possible flaws in
completing the notification form. The quality
control percentages obtained by the São Paulo
Cancer Registry from 1997 to 2005 indicated that
they were within the values suggested by IARC
and INCA, although the percentage of missing
information on age and the mortality/incidence
ratio showed only borderline acceptability.

Data analysis

Incidence and mortality rates by type of cancer
were calculated with the following formulas.

- Incidence rate:
(number of cancer cases / mid-year population)
x 100,000

- Mortality rate:
(number of cancer deaths / mid-year population) x 100,000

## Results

Table 2 shows the distribution of cases by district,
sex, and period in the city of São Paulo.
Cases were considered that provided the patient’s place of residence for all types of cancer.
From 1997 to 2005, there were more cancer
cases in women (53.3%) than in men (46.7%) in
the city of São Paulo.

Table 2


Table 3 shows cancer deaths from 1997 to
2004 in the selected districts in the city of São
Paulo, distributed by sex, considering all types
of cancer.
In the city of São Paulo, the proportion of cancer deaths from 1997 to 2004 was higher in men
(52.6%) than in women (47.4%).
Correlation analysis indicated that for some
types of cancer (skin, lung, thyroid, larynx, and
bladder), statistical correlation was high and significant in some periods, especially for incidence.
Table 4 presents the correlation coefficients between skin cancer incidence and PM10 and Table
5 presents the correlation coefficients between
lung cancer incidence and PM10.
The time lag between skin cancer incidence
rates and PM10 exposure varied from 7 to 14 years,
while for lung cancer, the significant correlations
occurred from 11 to 16 years after exposure.
Figure 1 shows the types of cancer, according
to the number of events with high correlations
and significant p-values, based on monitoring
PM10 for incidence.
Skin cancer showed one value with high correlation in the year 1989, three in 1991, seven in
1992, five in 1993, totaling 16 high correlations for
incidence during the period.
Lung cancer showed 15 high correlations between 1988 and 1997 for incidence.
PM10 values measured from 1988 to 1997 may
possibly impact cancer incidence from 1997 to
2005.

Figures 2 and 3 present the relative risk maps
for incidence and mortality rates for skin and
lung cancer showing high correlations with PM10.
The opposing colors indicate that values below
1 refer to the districts with fewer cases or deaths
than expected, while values greater than 1 indicate more cases or deaths than expected for the
respective districts.
The relative risk map for skin cancer incidence on this scale of analysis shows a radialconcentric distribution, highlighting two districts
with RR two standard deviations above the mean:
Morumbi and Moóca. However, for skin cancer
mortality, Morumbi no longer ranked highest.
The highest risks were in the following districts:
Butantã, Bela Vista, República, Brás, Moóca, and
Tatuapé. The relative risk maps for lung cancer
incidence and mortality showed similar spatial
patterns during the study period. The risks for incidence were high in Santo Amaro, Butantã, Consolação, Bela Vista, Bom Retiro, and Brás. Santo
Amaro, Consolação, Bom Retiro, and Brás also
showed high mortality risk.

## Discussion

Pearson correlation showed high incidence
rates for some types of cancer: skin, lung, larynx, thyroid, and bladder. For skin cancer, the
correlation coefficients were high and significant, considering the PM10 prior to 1993 and the
incidence rates after 1999. The results for lung


cancer were similar to skin cancer, showing high
and significant correlations with PM10 prior to
1993 and incidence rates starting in 2000. For the
incidence of cancer of the larynx, thyroid, and
bladder, there were fewer high correlations, but
they mostly occurred prior to 1993. As for mortality, the high correlations occurred with lung
cancer. The long time lag between PM10 and incidence and mortality rates confirmed the long
latency period for lung cancer, corroborating the
literature [21].
Cangerana-Pereira et al. [22], in a study on the
impact of overall air pollution on the incidence
of lung and laryngeal cancer in the city of São
Paulo in 1997, found a significant association between laryngeal cancer and ozone, highlighting
the need for future studies for verification and
better understanding of the long-term impact of
pollution on human health.
A considerable proportion of known risk factors for cancer relates to long-term exposures [9].
According to a review by Pope 3rd [23], the adverse
health effects depend on the concentration and
duration of exposure. Long-term exposure to PM
has larger, more persistent, and more cumulative
effects than short-term exposure. Studies have
shown that long exposure to PM is associated with
deficits in pulmonary function and an increase in
the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, like chronic cough and bronchitis. PM10
is known to be an indicator of inhalable particles
that can penetrate the thoracic region of the lungs.

are byproducts of incomplete combustion processes and vehicle exhaust that are found in high
concentrations in PM, and which require metabolic activation to become electrophilic and exert
their carcinogenic potential [24]. Valavanidis et al.

25 emphasize that polycyclic aromatic hydrocar

bons are highly mutagenic, with tumor-promoting activity, and responsible for the increased risk
of malignant neoplasms, especially lung cancer.
However, there is still uncertainty about the effect
of PM pollution on lung cancer risk. Literature reviews suggest that the combustion related to PM
air pollution can result in a small increase in the

risk of this type of cancer, but there are still gaps in
the knowledge on these questions [2].
Gallus et al. [26] reviewed epidemiological studies on air pollution and cancer. The focus of the
studies was the association between particulate
matter and lung cancer. The association was not


clear, since there were persistent uncertainties
on exposure measurement and latency.
Franco et al. [27] reviewed PAHs and human
health, discussing methodologies for the determination of some biomarkers. PAHs are widely
distributed in the environment due to the emis

sions from gasoline and diesel engines, and some
are carcinogenic, potentially acting on the skin
and airway cells. Biomarkers are considered
promising in the study of populations exposed to
chemical contaminants.
Randem et al. [28] showed that workers directly
exposed to asphalt and tar in Denmark, Finland,
Norway, and Sweden present evidence of increased risk of developing bladder cancer. They
studied cancer incidence among 22,362 male
workers for more than one work season involving
exposure to tar (asphalt). The chemical agents
that stand out in asphalt emissions are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. During paving work
with asphalt, PAHs are adsorbed on the particulate matter that is emitted, reaching the lungs all
the way to the alveoli.
The impacts of PM pollution on human health
remain to be fully elucidated, including an understanding of the greatest risk or susceptibility to the
event, the impacts of exposure to particulate matter on infant mortality and birth outcomes, including fetal growth, prematurity, intrauterine mortality, and birth defects, the effects of exposure on
lung cancer risk, and the role of the various characteristics and components of particulate matter
and the relative importance of the related sources
of pollutants [29].
According to Danaei et al. [30], more than a
third of cancer deaths in the world can be attributed to nine potentially modifiable risk factors
(smoking, alcohol consumption, low consumption of fruit, vegetables, and greens, smoke from
burning solid fuels in closed environments, urban air pollution, physical inactivity, overweight
and obesity, unprotected sex, and contaminated


injections in health units). In low and middle income countries, smoking accounts for an estimated 18% of cancer deaths, low consumption of
fruit, vegetables, and greens for 6%, and alcohol
consumption for 5%.
Analysis of the spatial distribution of the various types of cancer during the period showed
than in some districts of São Paulo, the relative
risk of mortality was higher than that of incidence, possibly indicating some deficiency in
access to diagnosis and treatment. In addition,
the radial-concentric pattern of relative risks in
this scale of analysis may be related to the greater
predominance of the younger population on the
urban periphery.
Some study limitations should be considered.
The principal difficulty in understanding chronic
diseases derives from the long latency period.
Since 1997, a considerable number of studies
have dealt with the health effects of exposure to
PM [29]. Various cohort studies have highlighted
the evidence of long-term or chronic health effects [29]. In studies with an ecological design, the
data represent mean exposure levels rather than
real individual levels. Controlling for confounders like smoking, alcoholism, and others was not
possible due to the absence of this information in
the databank. In addition, the population’s daily
mobility, outdoor exposure time, and other important variables cannot be considered in this
type of study. The limited number of air quality
monitoring stations in the city also prevents all
the districts from being analyzed. Other important pollutants should also be investigated in future studies.

The study showed that urban PM10 air pollution
in the city of São Paulo was associated with incidence and mortality for some types of cancer. For
incidence, the types of cancer that showed high
correlations were: skin, lung, thyroid, larynx, and
bladder. For mortality, lung cancer showed the
largest number of high correlations during the
period.

The results indicate the need to adopt measures aimed at reducing the concentration of this
air pollutant and the importance of its continuous monitoring.

Resumo

_O trabalho teve como objetivo verificar a influência_
_do poluente atmosférico material particulado inalável_
_(MP10) na incidência e na mortalidade por câncer, no_
_Município de São Paulo, Brasil. Foram utilizadas téc-_
_nicas estatísticas para verificar a relação do MP10 sobre_
_a incidência e a mortalidade de alguns tipos de cân-_
_cer nos distritos onde são monitorados este poluente._
_Pele, pulmão, tireoide, laringe e bexiga apresentaram_
_coeficientes de correlação estatística entre 0,60 e 0,80,_
_em alguns períodos, para a incidência. Para a morta-_
_lidade, o câncer de pulmão apresentou mais correla-_
_ções nesse intervalo. A análise espacial mostrou que_
_distritos distantes do centro da cidade apresentaram_
_risco relativo acima do esperado. O estudo mostrou_
_que o MP10 urbano pode contribuir para o aumento_
_da incidência de alguns tipos de câncer e pode contri-_
_buir também para o crescimento da mortalidade por_
_esta causa. Os resultados indicam a necessidade de se_
_adotar medidas que visem à redução da concentração_
_desse poluente na atmosfera e, também, a importância_
_do seu contínuo monitoramento._
