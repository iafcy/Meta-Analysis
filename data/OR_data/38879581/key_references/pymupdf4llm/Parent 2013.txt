###### ABSTRACT Objectives There is a paucity of information on environmental risk factors for prostate cancer. We conducted a case–control study in Montreal to estimate associations with exposure to ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a marker for traffic-related air pollution. Methods Cases were 803 men with incident prostate cancer, ≤75 years of age, and diagnosed across all French hospitals in Montreal. Concurrently, 969 controls were drawn from electoral lists of French-speaking individuals residing in the same electoral districts as the cases and frequency-matched by age. Concentrations of NO2 were measured across Montreal in 2005–2006. We developed a land use regression model to predict concentrations of NO2 across Montreal for 2006. These estimates were back-extrapolated to 1996. Estimates were linked to residential addresses at the time of diagnosis or interview. Unconditional logistic regression was used, adjusting for potential confounding variables. Results For each increase of 5 parts per billion of NO2, as estimated from the original land use regression model in 2006, the OR5ppb adjusted for personal factors was 1.44 (95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). Adding in contextual factors attenuated the OR5ppb to 1.27 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.58). One method for back-extrapolating concentrations of NO2 to 1996 (about 10 years before the index date) gave the following OR5ppb: 1.41 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.62) when personal factors were included, and 1.30 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.52) when contextual factors were added. Conclusions Exposure to ambient concentrations of NO2 at the current address was associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. This novel finding requires replication.

 INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer has the highest incidence of all
tumours among Canadian men, with an estimated
26 500 new cases in 2012.[1] Age-adjusted incidence
rates have remained stable over the last decade,
while mortality rates have declined somewhat.
Similar patterns have been observed in several
other countries.[2]

The incidence of prostate cancer increases exponentially with age, is higher among men with a
first-degree relative affected by the disease, and
varies by geography and ancestry.[3 4] There are no
accepted modifiable risk factors for this cancer.
Evidence from migrant studies suggests that environmental influences may be implicated in its aetiology [5] In addition diet physical activity


circumstances and smoking have been investigated,
but no clear signal has emerged.[2]

Local vehicular traffic in urban areas is a primary
contributor to air pollution. Vehicular emissions
include gases, particles, volatile organic compounds
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
Some constituents are recognised carcinogens (eg,
benzene) and may have hormone-modulating properties.[6] Little is known about the role of air pollution in prostate cancer. Two ecological studies of
air pollution conducted in the USA in the 1960s,
one in Erie County, New York[7] and the other in
Nashville, Tennessee,[8] found positive associations
with prostate cancer mortality, while a recent
cohort study from Denmark found no association
with the incidence of prostate cancer.[9]

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has been shown to be a
good marker for traffic-related pollution.[10][–][12]

Similar to the approach used by us in another
study,[13][–][15] our objective was to determine whether
traffic-related air pollution was associated with incident prostate cancer.

###### METHODS
We restricted the population to French-speaking
men living on the Island of Montreal and Nuns’
Island, which have a population of approximately
1.8 million people.[16] Over 86% of the population
on the Island of Montreal speak French.

###### Study population
The Prostate Cancer and Environment Study
(PROtEuS) is a case–control study of environmental
risk factors for prostate cancer. Study subjects were
men, under 76 years of age at the time of diagnosis
or selection, residents of the greater Montreal area,
listed on the Province of Quebec’s permanent electoral list (continually updated) and Canadian citizens. Cases were actively ascertained through
pathology departments across all 11 French hospitals, of the total of 14 hospitals that diagnose prostate cancer in the Montreal area. We included all
patients diagnosed with primary, histologically confirmed prostate cancer (International Classification
of Diseases, 10th revision, code C61) between
September 2005 and June 2008. Control subjects
were selected concurrently from the populationbased provincial electoral French-speaking list, and
frequency-matched to cases by 5-year age groups.
The electoral list is thought to represent a nearly
complete listing of Canadian citizens residing in the
province of Quebec Controls were drawn ran

-----

districts (about 40 000 electors each), corresponding to those of
the case series. Subjects were still eligible if they had a history of
cancer other than prostate cancer.

###### Data collection
As part of face-to-face interviews, participants provided information about socio-demographic characteristics, a wide range of
lifestyle-related factors, a prostate cancer screening history and
detailed occupational histories. The degree of aggressiveness of
[prostate cancers, as defined by the Gleason score (http://](http://gleasonscore.net/)
[gleasonscore.net/), was extracted from pathology reports. Ethics](http://gleasonscore.net/)
committees at all participating institutions approved the protocol and subjects provided informed consent.

###### Assessment of exposure to traffic-related air pollution
Findings from our sampling survey of ambient concentrations of
NO2 conducted in Montreal in 2005 and 2006 were reported
previously.[14] NO2 is recognised as a marker of traffic-related pollution due in part to its co-locational association with other pollutants.[10][–][12] NO2 is a near-source exhaust dilution pollutant that
is formed within seconds and metres of emission from vehicles,
and so can be used as a marker of traffic-related air pollution. It
correlates with elemental carbon (a product of combustion) and
with distance from roadways, and studies of areas with high
traffic density show some of the highest levels of NO2 compared
to other locations where there is no traffic.[11] Although NO2 has
a regional component, measurement close to the surface of roads
will measure mostly traffic-related sources. A number of Dutch
studies have shown correlations with elemental carbon and with
distance from roadways.[11] NO2 is the most widely used marker
for traffic-related air pollution: in a review paper, Hoek et al[12]

showed that in 18 cities where it has been measured, roadways,
traffic, and truck routes were all important predictors.[12]

Briefly, the locations for the samplers were selected using a
location-allocation model that placed samplers in areas likely to
have high spatial variability in traffic-related pollution and high
population densities.[17] Samplers were deployed at 133 locations
on roadside utility poles, approximately 3 m above the ground,
across the Island of Montreal on three occasions (spring, summer,
winter) to obtain 2-week integrated samples. We used Ogawa
passive diffusion samplers that use triethanolamine-impregnated
filters as an absorbent. Valid observations at 129 locations were
obtained from all three sampling periods.
We used these observations to develop a land use regression
model to predict concentrations of mean annual NO2 for 2005–
2006, at a resolution of 5 m[2] across the Island of Montreal.[14]

We modelled the natural logarithm of NO2 on land use and
traffic-related variables to generate an exposure surface (R[2] =
0.80). We found that the most important predictors were traffic
counts, major roads, and other land use associated with traffic.
In addition, the highest values were found along the major roadways and highways in the city.
Residential addresses, at the time of diagnosis for cases and at
the time of interview for controls, were then linked to the
exposure surface. Eighty-seven per cent of subjects included in
the present analysis were geocoded to the x,y coordinates of
their home address and 13% were geocoded to the centroid of
the area represented by the six-character postal code, which in
Montreal usually refers to a block face or to a large apartment
complex.

###### Historical estimates of exposure
We developed three separate but related methods[15] to back

of ambient NO2 from 12 fixed-site monitoring stations of
Environment Canada’s National Air Pollution Surveillance
network. These measurements of NO2 were used to produce
location-specific ratios that would scale the 2006 surface, using
three related back-extrapolation methods[15]: for method 1, we
used inverse distance weighting on the mean annual concentrations at the fixed-site stations to interpolate the spatial surfaces,
while for methods 2 and 3 we made use of land use regression
models to produce the surfaces.

###### Method 1
For method 1, we divided the interpolated surface from the
fixed-site monitors in 1996 by the interpolated surface for
2006. We then multiplied our original land use regression
model by this ratio to produce a surface of estimated annual
mean concentrations of NO2 for 1996.

###### Method 2
For method 2, we used land use regression models to create two
surfaces to form the ratio. The numerator was computed by
regressing the observed annual concentrations of NO2 at the 12
fixed-site monitors in 1996 against a reduced set of spatial variables that were used in the land use regression model of 2006.
For the denominator, we used as the dependent variable predicted concentrations at the 12 fixed-site monitors from the
land use regression model of 2006, and then regressed these
predicted values against the same covariates that were selected
for the numerator. We then formed the ratio of the 1996 to the
2006 newly developed surfaces and multiplied by the land use
regression surface of 2006.

###### Method 3
For method 3, we applied the regression coefficients of an alternative land use regression model for 2006 (R[2]=0.65) to land
use and traffic variables measured in 1996. This alternative
model was developed because not all spatial variables used in
2006 were available for 1996. As in method 2, we then multiplied this alternative model by the ratio of two additional
models: for the numerator we used as dependent variables
observed values at the 12 stations in 1996, and for the denominator we used predicted values from the alternative land use
regression model at the same 12 locations.
Using back-extrapolation methods similar to those for 1996,
we also developed a set of historical exposure estimates for
1985 based on 10 fixed-site monitors. Considering the
unknown proportion of subjects who would have lived in 1985
at an address other than the one they had in 2006, as well as
the probable lower reliability of estimates for 1985, the latter
are treated here as sensitivity analyses.

###### Statistical analysis
Our main analyses focused on the recent exposure estimates
(2006) and the back-extrapolated estimates of exposure 10 years
earlier (1996). We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate OR and 95% CI between exposure to NO2 and the risk of
developing prostate cancer. We included continuous covariates
as linear terms or as natural cubic spline functions if the
response was non-linear. Individual-level covariates considered
included age, first-degree family history of prostate cancer,
ancestry, family income, body mass index and attained level of
education, but not all of these were included in the final
models, as some variables did not show associations.
We postulated that neighbourhood deprivation a contextual


-----

confound associations with air pollution because deprived populations often live in areas that are characterised by higher concentrations of air pollution.[18] 19 There is no information,
however, as to whether these variables are causally associated
with prostate cancer or are surrogates for other causal factors.
We made use of Canadian census tract data from 1996 to
describe the socio-economic characteristics of Montreal’s neighbourhoods according to the address at the index date. Variables
describing median household income and percentage of adults
who did not complete high school were compiled for the 350
census tracts that included addresses of subjects (heretofore
referred to as neighbourhood ecologic covariates).
Standard regression diagnostics were applied to identify possible influential subjects and to ensure that the models did not
violate the assumptions of the logistic models. Potential effectmodification according to all of the covariates was evaluated.
We included NO2 as a continuous, linear variable after verifying this assumption through the use of b-spline functions (2
degrees of freedom) and visual inspection of the fitted
exposure–response curves. ORs are presented for each increase
in exposure to NO2 of 5 parts per billion (ppb), referred to as
OR5ppb.

###### Sensitivity analyses
We conducted analyses using estimates back-extrapolated to
1985. In addition, we considered the potential confounding
effects of smoking and alcohol consumption where we assessed
the effect of status (never smoked/drank, ex-smoker/drinker,
current smoker/drinker) as well as indices of cumulative
smoking and alcohol consumption. We also compared the
results for subjects who were geo-coded to x,y coordinates and
those who were geocoded to the centroid of the area represented by the six-character postal code. Separate analyses were
carried out among those subjects for whom we had information
on duration of residence, restricting to those who had been residents at the same address for 10 or more years prior to interview. We also investigated whether severity of prostate cancer,
and whether restricting subjects to those who had been screened
for prostate cancer, affected the estimates. Lastly, we determined
whether response patterns had any substantial effect on the
findings.

###### RESULTS
Although 1260 prostate cancer cases and 1535 controls from
the Greater Montreal area had been interviewed at the time of
analysis, we had spatial estimates of air pollution only for the
Island of Montreal and Nuns’ Island. We thus excluded 457
prostate cases and 566 controls who lived in outlying regions,
thereby leaving 803 cases and 969 controls for the present analyses. The mean (SD) age of cases and controls was 65 (7) years.
Response rates were 86% for cases and 63% for controls.
Reasons for non-participation among cases were refusal (94%),
unable to trace (3%), death with no proxy available (2%) and
language barrier (1%). Among eligible controls, nonparticipation was attributable to refusal (86%), unable to trace
(11%), language barrier (1%), death with no proxy available
(1%) and too sick with no proxy available (1%). Proxy respondents provided information for 3% and 5% of cases and controls, respectively. Table 1 shows the distributions of recognised
and selected potential risk factors for prostate cancer and associated age-adjusted ORs and 95% CIs. A first-degree family
history of prostate cancer conferred a twofold increase in risk.
Compared to men of French ancestry men of African descent


developing prostate cancer. Men who only completed primary
school had higher risks than all others. There was little difference between groups on body mass index, smoking, alcohol
intake, proxy responses and annual family income.
We estimated age-adjusted ORs for the three ecological covariates acting as possible confounding variables; that is, median
household income, percentage of recent immigrants and percentage of adults who did not complete high school (the first
two were modelled as natural cubic splines on 2 degrees of
freedom). We observed an inverse association with median
household income and found higher risks as the proportion of
individuals without a high school education increased. Higher
risks were found amongst men in the third quartile of the distribution of recent immigrants.

###### Associations with estimates of concentrations of ground-level NO2
Concentrations of NO2 decreased from a mean of 43.2 mg/m[3]

in 1985 to 25.7 mg/m[3] in 2009, a 41% reduction. Table 2
shows that the mean concentrations of NO2 estimated from our
original land-use regression (2006) were 12.4 ppb amongst cases
and 11.8 ppb amongst controls. Making use of our three backextrapolation methods, mean concentrations in 1996 were
between 17.5 ppb and 17.8 ppb amongst cases and between
16.4 ppb and 16.9 ppb amongst controls.
The surfaces that we used also reflected a narrowing of the
distributions of NO2 over time. We found positive correlations
between 1000 randomly sampled locations on the different
exposure surfaces (Pearson correlation coefficients: 0.96–0.99)
and observed annual mean concentrations of NO2 at the fixedsite stations for 1985, 1996 and 2006 suggesting that the spatial
patterns of NO2 did not vary importantly during the 20-year
period between 1985 and 2006. Furthermore, the observed
concentrations at the locations of the fixed-site monitoring stations in 2006 were correlated with those in 1996 (r=0.89, 95%
CI 0.60 to 0.97) and in 1985 (r=0.72, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94;
see online supplementary eTable 1 and eFigure 1). Table 3
shows OR5ppb for prostate cancer adjusted for age only, adjusted
for age and personal covariates, and adjusted for these variables
and the three ecological variables. Personal covariates included
age (linear), first-degree family history of prostate cancer (yes,
no, don’t know), ancestry (French, African, Asian, other,
unknown) and attained level of education (six categories).
Family income and body mass index were not retained in the
models as they were not associated with the risk of prostate
cancer. There were no influential observations in these or any
other analyses.
We did not find any evidence of non-linearity in the response
functions for NO2 (see online supplementary eFigure 2) and we
thus present ORs for each increase of 5 ppb in NO2 making use
of the land use regression map developed in 2005–2006 (essentially the index date period) as well as the three methods of
back-extrapolation to 1996. There were minimal differences
between OR5ppb adjusted only for age and those also adjusted
for selected personal factors. The OR5ppb using NO2 evaluated
in 2006 using our original land use regression model was 1.44
(95% CI 1.21 to 1.73). It was attenuated to 1.27 (95% CI 1.03
to 1.58) when the three ecological factors were included.
Median household income was the only ecological factor that
attenuated the ORs and inclusion of personal income did not
affect the risk estimates (data not shown). For the period about
10 years before the index date (1996), the range of the
fully-adjusted OR5 b [was between 1 23 and 1 38 attenuated]

###### Sensitivity analyses
For 1985, the fully-adjusted OR5ppb varied between 1.11 and
1.17 (see online supplementary eTable 3). The OR5ppb tended
to be somewhat higher when analyses were restricted to cases
with a Gleason score <7, as compared to those with a Gleason
score ≥7 (considered to indicate aggressive cancer), but CIs
overlapped. For example, the fully-adjusted OR5ppb associated
with our original land use model (2006) were 1.41 (95% CI
1.07 to 1.86) and 1.23 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.58) for nonaggressive and aggressive cancers, respectively.
Additional analyses excluded proxy subjects and included
smoking (pack-years) and alcohol (drink-years) in the models,
entered as continuous covariates using natural cubic splines on 4
and 2 degrees of freedom, but this did not alter the results (data
not shown). There was no evidence of effect modification
according to any of the covariates (data not shown).
We conducted analyses restricting to subjects who reported
that they had been screened for prostate cancer within the previous 5 years (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and/or a digital
rectal examination), in order to reduce the possibility of


undiagnosed prostate cancer in the control series (see online
supplementary eTable 4). There were few differences from the
main analyses.
A separate analysis restricted subjects to those who lived at
the same address for 10 or more years at the time of diagnosis
for cases and at the time of interview for controls. This analysis
is limited because we did not start asking this question until well
into the data collection, and it is based on only 71 cases and
223 controls. About 70% of subjects for whom duration of residency at the current address was collected had lived there for at
least 10 years. For the original land use model, we found among
those subjects who had lived in their homes for 10 years an
OR5ppb of 1.36 (95% CI 0.76 to 2.45) and adding in the ecological covariates attenuated this to 1.13 (95% CI 0.56 to 2.29),
compatible with our main findings (see online supplementary
eTable 5).
Analyses comparing whether the address was geocoded directly to x,y coordinates (1522 subjects) or to the centroid of the
six-character postal code (250 subjects) generated fairly similar
results (see online supplementary eTable 6).

Non-participants were generally similar to participants, with a
slight trend towards non-participants living in areas with a greater
proportion of recent immigrants within the previous 10 years,
with a higher unemployment rate, with a greater proportion of
adults without a high school diploma, and with a lower median
household income (data not shown). These findings are consistent
with the absence of major socio-economic disparities between subjects who participated in the study and those who did not. We also
carried out an analysis that included all eligible cases and controls,
including non-participants, to evaluate the potential impact of
non-participation. While we had no information on personal covariates for non-participants, we found similar results when adjusting only for age and slightly attenuated ORs after including the
ecological variables (data not shown).

###### DISCUSSION
Our findings showed increased risks of incident prostate cancer
among men exposed to higher concentrations of NO2, a marker
of traffic-related air pollution. These findings are novel and surprising. As discussed below, associations persisted when we considered potential alternate explanations and sensitivity analyses,
but we are cautious in interpreting the results.
Local, national and international geographical variations in
patterns of occurrence of prostate cancer are one of its most
puzzling characteristics. Identification of modifiable risk factors
for this disease has remained largely unsuccessful and the use of
spatially referenced data represents a potentially fruitful avenue
for research.[20]

Combustion engines produce thousands of compounds,
including fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, PAHs and volatile organic compounds.[21] The magnitude
of the risk estimates varied somewhat when estimates of exposure from different time periods were used. We found the
highest risks for recent estimates of pollution but also found
slightly increased risks for more remote estimates. It is likely
that the back-extrapolated estimates of exposure entailed more
misclassification than the original land use model, and this may
explain the observed reductions in relative risks.
Long-term exposure to ambient air pollution entails potential
exposure to a wide range of chemicals or compounds and it has


cancer, there is strong evidence of an association with lung
cancer.[23] For prostate cancer, only a few studies have been conducted. In two ecological studies conducted on suspended particles in the USA in the 1960s, one by Winkelstein and Kantor[7] in
Erie County, New York and the other by Hagstrom et al[8] in
Nashville, Tennessee, associations were observed with prostate
cancer mortality. In one other study, increased mortality from
prostate cancer was found to be associated with residential proximity to metal industrial facilities,[24] while in another investigation, a slightly higher incidence of prostate cancer was reported
among men living near a major airport.[25] More recently,
Raaschou-Nielsen et al[9] as part of the Diet, Cancer and Health
cohort study in Denmark, made use of modelled concentrations
of NOx at residences and reported associations with cervical
and brain cancer incidence but not with prostate cancer (HR of
0.96 per an increase of 100 μg/m[3] of NOx; 673 cases).
There is clearly insufficient information to make any informed
judgments regarding whether air pollution causes prostate cancer,
and our findings could be due to chance. The prostate cancer carcinogenesis process is poorly understood and we believe that it is
premature to speculate at length on potential mechanisms. A
number of occupational studies have provided some information
on occupational circumstances that may increase the risk of developing prostate cancer. In two reviews, the following occupational
factors were identified as possibly associated with this cancer:
farming, pesticides and herbicides, cadmium, mineral oils, metal
working-related exposures, and PAHs and engine emissions.[26 27]

In a few studies using substance-based exposure assessment protocols, increased risks of prostate cancer have been observed among
men occupationally exposed to PAHs from coal[28] and diesel
fumes,[29] but these findings have not been replicated in other
studies.[30 31] While several chemicals may cause endocrine disruption or modulation[32 33] and might relate to the development of
prostate cancer,[6] the hormonal hypothesis remains unconfirmed.
Of course, many of the compounds in ambient air, such as PAHs,
may act directly as carcinogens.
We acknowledge that the present analysis provides only
partial information on personal exposure to air pollution. Total
personal exposure is related to a number of factors, including
daily activity patterns and amount of time spent indoors and

address as a surrogate of exposure are thus related to population
mobility: people do not necessarily live in the same home over
the course of their lifetime nor do they spend all of their time at
home. While it is true that many subjects may spend their days
away from home, a study by Leech et al[34] found that Canadian
adults spend on average ∼67–68% of their time at home
(indoors and outdoors combined). Our analysis restricted to
subjects who lived for 10 or more years at the current address
were compatible with our primary results.
Given some imprecision associated with geocoded addresses
and other geographical data, as well as the fact that we used spatially derived exposures as surrogates for personal exposures,
the risk estimates presented here are clearly misclassified. Thus,
our results may underestimate the true estimates of the relative
risk of prostate cancer associated with exposure to air pollution
in this population.
We could not assess associations with early life exposures, nor
do we know what age periods may be critical in the induction
of cancer. However, sensitivity analyses suggested that risks
were slightly elevated using exposure estimates pertaining to
25 years before interview. Further work is needed to verify
whether these results represent true associations or whether
they are due to chance or to undetected bias. Our findings
should not be interpreted as meaning that NO2 might be a
causal factor; should the association with NO2 be confirmed, it
would more likely reflect an association with the complex
mixture that is derived from the combustion of hydrocarbons.[35]

This study focuses on the majority French-speaking population in Montreal. Cases were ascertained across all French hospitals, covering over 80% of all cases in the region. In order to
reduce the potential for referral bias, we selected
French-speaking controls who came from the same areas of the
city as the cases. A comparison of the distribution of residential
postal codes amongst cases and controls indeed confirmed that
both groups resided in the same geographical areas. Access to
medical care is entirely free across all Montreal hospitals, and it
is reasonable to assume that French-speaking controls would be
referred to the French-speaking hospitals where the cases arose.
Response rates were relatively high among cases (86%) and lower
among controls (63%). Our analysis based on all eligible subjects
suggests that differential response rates did not substantially alter
the risks. Inflated estimates of risk may be expected if, for example,
controls with higher educational levels responded more frequently
than the target population and if higher concentrations of air pollution are inversely associated with higher educational levels.[18]

Cancer screening practices are an important issue in studies of
prostate cancer. In this study population, prostate cancer screening was widespread. In the 5 years preceding the index date,
about 40% of cases and the same proportion of controls had
been PSA-tested between one and four times, and 36.0% of
cases and 47.1% of controls had had five PSA tests, what could
be considered to be the equivalent of about one routine PSA
test each year, on average, which corresponds to common practice in Montreal. Nearly all (98.8%) cases reported being
screened (PSA test and/or digital rectal examination), while
75.2% of controls reported being screened in the 2 years before
the index date. It may well be that some of the recent screening
tests reported by cases were in fact diagnostic tests based on
symptoms, but we have no information to verify this.
Sub-analyses restricting controls to those men who reported
having been screened for prostate cancer in the previous 5 years
yielded results similar to those from the main analyses.
We observed associations previously confirmed in population

descent, lower risks among those of Asian descent, and an
excess risk with a first-degree family history of prostate
cancer.[36 37] It is possible that the observed associations reflect a
role for an aetiological factor correlated with traffic-related pollution and unaccounted for in our analyses.

###### CONCLUSIONS
Exposures to ambient concentrations of NO2 at the current
address were associated with an increased risk of incident prostate cancer. Should traffic-related air pollution prove to be
causal, it could explain a large proportion of new cases. It is
thus essential that other independent studies be conducted.

###### What this paper adds

 ▸ Geographical variations in the occurrence of prostate cancer are one of its most puzzling characteristics.
 ▸ Using a survey conducted in Montreal, Canada, of concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in ambient air, which is a marker for traffic-related air pollution, we developed a spatial map of these concentrations and linked them to the addresses of men with prostate cancer.
 ▸ While a handful of studies have examined this relationship, ours is the first to observe an association between exposure to traffic-related air pollution and prostate cancer incidence.
