Background
It has been known for decades that urban air is polluted
by mutagenic and carcinogenic substances [1], although
at concentrations much lower than those in e.g. cigarette smoke and certain work environments. Nielsen
et al. [2] found that the concentrations of mutagenic
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Copenhagen were similar to those in other cities in industrialized
countries and concluded that traffic was the major
source of PAHs in Copenhagen in the early 1990s. Ubiquitous air pollution with low levels of carcinogens is a
public health concern, because large populations are
exposed; therefore, even a marginally increased risk for
cancer at the individual level would result in many cases
at the population level.

Ultrafine particles, < 100 nm in diameter, have
received much attention since the 1990s because of
their high numbers and large surface area [3]. They

constitute about 50% of the total surface area of deposited particles in the lung [4]. The airways are the primary target organs, but accumulating evidence from
experiments in animals shows that ultrafine particles
can translocate to other organs, such as the liver, kidneys, heart and brain [5-7]. Although the number of
particles that accumulate in secondary target organs is
several orders of magnitude lower than the lung dose, it
may not be negligible for carcinogenic processes [4,8].

Previous epidemiological studies have shown associations between ambient air pollution and risk for lung
cancer [9-13], but other cancers might also be associated
with exposure to polluted air. Cancers of the mouth,
pharynx, and larynx are strongly related to smoking and
might therefore also be related to other sources of air
pollution, as indicated by associations with exposure to
combusted indoor fuel [14] and occupational exposure to
engine exhaust [15-18].

Bladder cancer has been associated with residence in a
polluted city area in a few studies of the general population [19,20] and with occupational exposure to air pollution (traffic, engine exhaust, PAHs) in several (but not

all) studies [21-24]. Other cancers have been studied
only sparsely in relation to air pollution. Occupational
exposure to diesel engine exhaust was associated with
risks for cervical [17], ovarian [23], and gastric cancer

[25], and several studies indicated associations between
occupations associated with exposure to air pollution
and risk for kidney cancer [15,16,26]. An ecological
association was found between ambient air emissions of
volatile organic compounds and brain cancer incidence
in Indiana, USA [27], and a recent study indicated that
air pollution at the residence increased the risk for
breast cancer [28]. Benzene at relatively high occupational concentrations is a known leukemogen, and a few
studies have suggested that ambient concentrations near
point sources [29] and traffic [30] might be associated
with risk for hematological cancers.
We have recently reported on traffic-related air pollution and lung cancer in a large Danish cohort [13]. The
individual-level assessment of exposure for all cohort
members facilitates a hypothesis-generating screening of
possible associations with other cancers than lung cancer.
The aim of the study reported here was to investigate
whether air pollution from traffic at the residence was
associated with risks for 20 selected, relatively frequent
cancers in a large Danish cohort.

Methods
Design and study participants
During 1993-1997, 57,053 men (48%) and women (52%)
aged 50-64 years and living in Copenhagen and Aarhus
areas were recruited into the Diet, Cancer and Health
cohort study [31]. The baseline examination included a
self-administered questionnaire on dietary habits, which
covered 192 food and beverage items. The participants
also filled in a questionnaire on smoking habits (status,
intensity, and duration), occupation, length of school
attendance, reproductive factors, history of diseases and
medication, and a number of other health-related items

[31]. Smoking intensity was calculated by equating a cigarette to 1 g, a cheroot or a pipe to 3 g, and a cigar to 4.5 g
of tobacco. Staff in the study clinics obtained anthropometric measurements, including height and weight. Relevant Danish ethical committees and data protection
agencies approved the study, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Each cohort member was followed up for cancer
occurrence until 27 June 2006 in the Danish Cancer
Registry [32] and the Danish Pathology Data Bank by
use of the unique personal identification number. We
traced the date of death, emigration, or disappearance
and retrieved the addresses of each cohort member
between 1 January 1971 and 27 June 2006 in the Central
Population Registry by use of the personal identification
number. The dates of moving into and leaving each


address were noted, and the addresses were linked to
the Danish address database to obtain geographical
coordinates (denoted in the following as ‘geocodes’),
which were obtained for 94% of the addresses.

Exposure assessment
The outdoor concentration of NOx was calculated for
each year at the residential addresses of each cohort
member with the Danish AirGIS modeling system (see
[http://www.dmu.dk/en/air/models/airgis/ and [33]). Air-](http://www.dmu.dk/en/air/models/airgis/)
GIS is based on a geographical information system and
provides estimates of traffic-related air pollution with
high temporal and address level spatial resolution. Air
pollution at a location is calculated as the sum of three
contributors: (1) local air pollution from street traffic,
calculated from input data on traffic (intensity and
type), emission factors for the car fleet, street and building geometry, and meteorology; (2) urban background,
calculated from data on urban vehicle emission density,
city dimensions, and building heights; and (3) regional
background, estimated from trends at rural monitoring
stations and from national vehicle emissions.
Input data for the AirGIS system were established from
various sources and were integrated into the model. A
geographical information system (GIS) road network,
including construction year and traffic data for the period
1960-2005, was developed and a database on emission factors for the Danish car fleet, with data on light- and
heavy-duty vehicles back to 1960, was built and entered
into the emission module of the street pollution model.
The national topographic GIS database of buildings was
supplemented by the construction year and building
height from the national Building and Dwelling Register,
which provided the correct street and building geometry
for a given year at a given address. The geocodes of an
address refer to the location of the front door with a precision within 5 m for most addresses. With the geocode of
an address and a specified year as the starting point, the
AirGIS system automatically generates street configuration
data for the street pollution model, including street orientation, street width, building heights in wind sectors, traffic
amount, speed and type as well as other data required as
inputs for the modeling system. Air pollution is calculated
in 2 m height at the façade of the address building. The
AirGIS system has been successfully validated in several
studies [34-36] and the correlation between modeled and
measured 1/2-year mean NO2 concentrations at 204 positions in the greater Copenhagen area showed a correlation
coefficient (r) of 0.90 with measured concentrations being
on average 11% lower than the modeled [35]. We also
compared modeled and measured one-month mean
concentrations of NOx and NO2 over a 12-year period
(1995-2006) in a busy street in Copenhagen (Jagtvej,
25,000 vehicles per day, street canyon), which showed


-----

http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/67

correlation coefficients (r) of 0.88 for NOx and 0.67 for
NO2. The modeled mean concentration over the whole
12-year period was 6% lower than the measured concentrations for NOx and 12% lower for NO2 [36]. Thus, the
model predicted both geographical and temporal variation
well.
We used the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx)
as an indicator of air pollution from traffic because NOx
level correlates strongly with other traffic-related pollutants in Danish streets, such as particles: r = 0.93 for
total particle number concentration (size, 10-700 nm)
and r = 0.70 for particles with a diameter < 10 μm [37].
We calculated the time-weighted average NOx concentration at all addresses from 1 January 1971 until cancer
diagnosis, censoring, or end of follow-up and entered it
as a time-dependent variable into the statistical cancer
risk model. If NOx could not be calculated because of
failed geocoding of an address, we imputed the concentration from that calculated at the preceding address, or
that at the subsequent address if the NOx concentration
was missing for the first address. We included only participants for whom the residential addresses were
known and geocoded for 80% or more of the time
between 1 January 1971 and censoring, i.e. persons for
whom NOx concentrations were imputed for less than
20% of the time.
We used the geocode of the address at the time of enrolment into the cohort and the GIS road network with traffic data to derive two variables indicating the amount of
traffic near the residence: presence of a street with a traffic
density > 10,000 vehicles per day within 50 m of the residence, and the total number of kilometers driven by vehicles within 200 m of the residence each day.
We considered the calculated NOx concentration as
our primary exposure variable because it takes into
account a number of factors that affect traffic-related air
pollution and because it reflects exposure over several
decades. The two supplementary measures of traffic at
the residence are simple indicators that reflect only the
time of enrolment into the cohort. The three exposure
indicators correlated moderately, with correlation coefficients of 0.53 between calculated NOx and presence of a
major road within 50 m, 0.43 between calculated NOx
and traffic load within 200 m, and 0.43 between presence of a major road within 50 m and traffic load
within 200 m. We gave most weight to the NOx measure in interpreting the results, so that the results for
the two traffic indicators could strengthen or weaken
interpretation of an effect of NOx as a traffic-related air
polluter.
The Danish AirGIS modeling system cannot provide
reliable estimates for historical particulate matter concentrations because the required input data on historical


urban background concentrations and historical emission factors for the Danish car fleet are not available.

Statistical methods
The end-points for the risk analyses were first primary
cancers others than lung cancer. We included only cancer types of which there were more than 30 cases during
follow-up. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were estimated
with Cox proportional hazards models, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of the
Wald test. Age was the time scale, which ensured that
the risk estimates were based on comparisons of individuals at exactly the same age, and analyses were corrected for delayed entry at the time of enrolment.
People with a cancer diagnosis before entry were
excluded from the analyses. Participants were censored
at the time of death, the time of loss to follow-up due
to emigration or disappearance, the time of a cancer
diagnosis other than that under study, or 27 June 2006
(end of follow-up), whichever came first.
The analyses were adjusted for potential confounding
factors defined a priori for each cancer site on the basis of
two criteria: 1) being an established or likely risk factor
for the cancer and 2) data being available. These were:
smoking status (never, former, current), smoking intensity
(lifetime average, linear), smoking duration (linear), environmental tobacco smoke (dichotomous, no or low, i.e. “no
smoker in the home and environmental tobacco smoke at
work for less than 4 h/day”, versus high), length of school
attendance (< 8, 8-10 and > 10 years), physical activity
during leisure time (sports: yes/no and h/week for active
people (linear)), body mass index (kg/m[2]; linear), dietary
intake of fruit (linear), vegetables (linear), red meat (linear), fiber (linear), selenium (sum of diet and supplements;
linear), calcium (sum of diet and supplements; linear),
alcohol intake (yes/no and g/day (linear)), use of hormone
replacement therapy (never/ever and duration for ever
users (linear)), use of oral contraceptives (never/ever and
duration for ever users (linear)), number of childbirths
(none/any and number (linear)), age at first childbirth
(none/any and age (linear)), lactation (none/any and time
(linear)), previous benign breast tumor (yes/no), previous
diagnosis of hypertension (yes/no), skin reaction to sun
(severe or moderate burning, light to no burn), tanning
during summer (very or moderately dark, faint or not
tanned), nevi (no or few, moderate or many) and freckles
(none or few, some or many). Moreover, we defined
dichotomous indicators of exposure to occupational carcinogens specific to each cancer site from questionnaire
responses about jobs held for a minimum of 1 year and
from evaluations in the International Agency for Research
[on Cancer series http://monographs.iarc.fr/ (see Addi-](http://monographs.iarc.fr/)
tional file 1).

We tested the linearity of the adjusted associations
between NOx concentration and risk for each of the 20
cancers by the likelihood ratio test, i.e. testing whether
adding non-linear terms improved the fit over the linear
model; p < 0.05 was used as criterion for non-linearity.
The exposure-response function for 19 sites did not deviate significantly from linearity, while a deviation of borderline significance was found for pancreas cancer. Thus, for
all 20 cancers we estimated the IRRs as linear functions
per 100-μg/m[3] increment in NOx and per 10[4] vehicle km/
day traffic load within 200 m of the residence. Non-linear
exposure-response curves with 95% confidence limits are
presented graphically for selected cancers. These functions
were estimated with the cph function, survival library, R
statistical software 2.9.0 using restricted cubic spline in the
coxph function. The plots were produced with the plot
function in the design library and reflect exposureresponse functions after adjustment for cancer-specific
sets of potential confounders.

Results
Of the 57,053 cohort members, 571 were excluded
because of a cancer diagnosis before enrolment, 2 because
of uncertain date of cancer diagnosis, 960 for which an
address history was not available in the Central Population
Registry or their baseline address could not be geocoded,
and 1,216 because exposure was assessed for less than
80% of the time between 1 January 1971 and diagnosis or
censoring. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of
the 54,304 cohort members who were included, who were
followed up for an average of 9.6 years. The participants
were on average 56.7 years old at enrolment, and there
were slightly more women than men. About one third had
never smoked; the median duration of smoking among
ever smokers was 33 years. The median time-weighted
average NOx concentration at the residences between
1971 and the censoring date was 21.9 μg/m[3] (minimum,
13.8 μg/m[3]; maximum, 347 μg/m[3]). At enrolment, 8.3% of
the cohort members lived at a residence within 50 m of a
street with a traffic density > 10,000 vehicles per day.
Table 2 shows the IRRs of 20 cancers in association with
concentrations of NOx at the residence. Table 3 shows
IRRs in association with amount of traffic at the residence.
In the adjusted analyses, three sites showed significant
associations: primary liver cancer in association with traffic
within 200 m of the residence, cervical cancer in association with NOx at the residence, a major street within 50 m
of the residence and traffic within 200 m of the residence,
and brain cancer in association with NOx at the residence
and a major street within 50 m of the residence.
Adjustment for potential confounders decreased the
IRRs for many cancers, including some smoking-related
cancers, such as esophagus and bladder cancer, and


breast cancer, whereas the IRR for e.g. cervical cancer
was less strongly affected by adjustment.
Figure 1 shows adjusted exposure-response functions
between NOx concentration at the residence and risks for
each of the three cancers for which significant IRRs are
shown in Tables 2, 3. The risk for cervical cancer
increased steadily with increasing exposure, the risk for
brain cancer increased mostly at concentrations in the
lower end of the exposure range, and the risk for liver cancer increased mostly in the upper end of the exposure
range.

Discussion
We found significant associations and exposureresponse patterns between traffic-related air pollution at
the residence and risks for cervical and brain cancer.
The strengths of this study include a 10-year prospective
follow-up of a relatively large cohort and adjustment for
potential confounders. Individual assessment of the exposure of all cohort members allowed us to link air pollution
to all major types of cancer. Virtually complete follow-up
for incident cancers was possible through nationwide
population-based registries, and complete follow-up for
vital status was available from the Central Population
Registry. Another strength of the study is the availability
of residential address histories dating back to 1971, so that
exposure could be assessed over several decades. A limitation of this study is the relatively few cases of some types
of cancer, although more than 100 cases were identified
for 11 of the 20 cancers included. The inclusion of cancers
at 20 different sites means that the results should be interpreted with caution. The positive findings for cancers at
sites for which there is no or little previous epidemiological evidence of an association with air pollution should be
considered as the basis for hypothesis-generating.
Exposure assessment is a major challenge in studies of
the health effects of long-term exposure to air pollution.
We used three markers of air pollution from traffic at residences, which were moderately correlated (r, 0.43-0.53).
The outdoor NOx level at all addresses was calculated
over decades from a validated model that requires comprehensive input data; the two other markers are simple,
intuitively understandable measures of traffic at the residence at the time of enrolment. The dispersion models we
used to assess NOx levels at the addresses of study participants have been successfully validated [34-36] and applied

[12,13,38]. Although markers of air pollution concentrations are inevitably somewhat uncertain, the resulting
non-differential misclassification would create artificial
associations only in rare situations [39]. If the geocoding,
and therefore also the exposure assessment, failed at an
address, we imputed the air pollution concentration from
the previous or next address. Since the imputation strategy

This study shows an exposure-response association

to diesel engine exhaust was previously associated with


risk for cervical cancer in a study with no adjustment for
tobacco smoking [17], but to our knowledge no study has
been conducted of the exposure of the general population to ambient air pollution. We adjusted our analyses
for smoking, education, and oral contraceptive use but

had no information on human papillomavirus (HPV)
infection, which is a major cause of cervical cancer [40].
It is possible that HPV infection is more prevalent among
women living in areas with heavy traffic and air pollution.
Early findings of associations between smoking and cervical cancer were similarly suspected of confounding by
HPV infection, although today smoking is an established
risk factor for this cancer. Further, we cannot exclude the
possibility that compliance with the nation-wide cervical
cancer screening program differs in areas with high and
low levels of air pollution due to differences in educational level. However, the educational level differed only
little between cohort members living at addresses with
high and low air pollution levels [13] and the results in
the present study was adjusted for educational level minimizing the potential for confounding. The hypothesis of
an association between air pollution and risk for cervical
cancer should be further investigated in a study with control for HPV infection (in addition to other risk factors),
preferably with more power than the current study.
We found an exposure-response association between
NOx at the residence and risk for brain cancer, which was


almost doubled for people living close to a street with high
traffic density. In general, the causes of brain cancer
remain unknown, although high-dose ionizing radiation
and certain genetic syndromes are established risk factors

[41]. These, however, seem unlikely to be associated with
air pollution at the residential address. A previous study in
Denmark indicated a higher risk for brain cancer in association with agricultural class and higher income [42].
These factors are probably inversely associated with air
pollution from traffic in Denmark, and, if they were risk
factors for brain tumors, we would expect any confounding to have decreased the IRR for brain cancer in association with air pollution. There is growing experimental
evidence that ultrafine particles can reach the brain both
via the systemic circulation through the blood-brain barrier and via the olfactory neuronal pathway [3,5], causing
an inflammatory response [43,44]. Further, a recent study
showed that exposure to diesel engine exhaust causes
functional changes in the human brain indicating cortical
stress response [45]. Boeglin et al. [27] showed an ecological association between emissions of volatile organic compounds and brain cancer incidence rates at county level in

the USA; but a large cohort study with individual adjustment for potential confounders showed that people who
lived in metropolitan areas with higher air pollution levels
measured at routine monitoring network stations did not
have a higher risk for death from brain cancer [46].
Although our study is smaller, it has several advantages,
including individual exposure assessment, thus accounting
for within-city variations in air pollution concentrations,
which might explain the difference in results. Furthermore, we studied brain cancer incidence, whereas the US
study measured mortality. If survival after brain cancer differs in different metropolitan areas and survival correlates
with air pollution levels, the results of a mortality study
would differ from those of a study of incidence. We
recommend that studies be conducted to replicate our
finding of an increased incidence of brain cancer in association with individual-level exposure to air pollution.
We found a borderline significantly increased risk for
liver cancer associated with traffic within 200 m of the
residence, after adjustment for relevant confounders,
although there was no significant association with NOx
levels. There is consistent evidence that liver cancer is
associated with tobacco smoking [47]. One of the few
previous epidemiological studies on ambient air pollution and liver cancer was a retrospective cohort study,


which showed an increased risk in urban bus drivers
and tramway employees [16]. Mucociliary clearance of
particles deposited in the airways usually leads to gastrointestinal exposure due to swallowing, and, in experimental studies, intragastric exposure of animals to diesel
exhaust particles induced oxidative stress and DNA
damage in the liver [48]. In addition, particles translocated to the circulation accumulated in Kupfer cells in
the liver, with very slow elimination and further potential oxidative stress [49].
Our study also showed that the risk for kidney cancer
increased with NOx concentration at the residence. Several studies of occupational groups, such as transport
workers, drivers, policemen, metal foundry workers, and
gasoline service station workers exposed to gasoline
vapors, engine exhaust, PAHs, and other air pollutants,
have indicated weakly increased risks for kidney cancer

[15,16,26], although the literature is neither consistent

[23] nor conclusive [50]. The indication in the present
study of an association between ambient air pollution at
the residence and risk for kidney cancer in a general
population should be confirmed before conclusions can
be drawn.
Our study showed a weak, insignificant association
between traffic-related air pollution and risk for breast

cancer. A recent study in Montreal, Canada, showed
that the risk for breast cancer was associated with NO2
concentrations at the residence [28], and a study in New
York, USA, indicated an association between early-life
exposure to air pollution at the residence and risk for
this cancer [51]. PAH-induced breast tumor mutations
might explain any link between air pollution and risk
for breast cancer [52].
Previous studies have shown associations between
risks for upper aerodigestive tract cancers and indoor
fuel combustion [14] and occupational exposure to
engine exhaust [15-18], and our study also indicated a
possible association between ambient traffic-related air
pollution and cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx,
although the result was insignificant.
Our results showed a weak, insignificant association
between traffic-related air pollution and bladder cancer.
The evidence of an association between ambient air pollution and bladder cancer in the general population is
not conclusive [19,20,30].
Benzene at relatively high occupational concentrations is
a known leukemogen, and a few studies have suggested
that ambient concentrations near point sources [29] and
near traffic [30] might be associated with risks for hematological cancers, whereas other studies found no such association [53,54]. The exposure of the general population to
benzene is much lower than the lowest effect level seen in
studies of occupational exposure, so that any related risk
for leukemia in the general population would probably not
be detectable with current methods [55]. Our results are
in accordance with this notion.
Although we found associations between NOx concentration and the risks for some cancers, NOx is an indicator
of vehicle engine exhaust, which is a complex mixture of
many carcinogenic and mutagenic chemicals [1]. The NOx
concentration correlates closely with that of particulate
matter, especially the ultrafine fraction emitted from diesel
engines in Danish streets [37]. Although it is difficult to
disentangle the effects of single air pollutants in epidemiological designs, particulate matter from traffic emissions
appears to be the most important determinant of cancer
risk. Ultrafine particles have a large surface area and contain absorbed PAHs, transition metals and other substances, which cause oxidative stress, inflammation and
direct and indirect genotoxicity [56,57]. Further, there is
evidence that ultrafine particles can translocate from the
airways to other organs [7], which might explain our finding of higher risks for cervical and brain cancer in cohort
members living at residences with high levels of trafficrelated air pollution.

Conclusions
In conclusion, this cohort study shows significant associations between traffic-related air pollution at


residential addresses over several decades and risks for
cervical and brain cancer. Although experimental evidence shows that ultrafine particles can translocate from
the airways to other organs, our results are based on
hypothesis-generating screening of 20 cancers and
future epidemiological studies are needed to provide
further information on possible risks for cancer associated with traffic-related air pollution. In particular the
hypotheses of associations with brain and cervical cancer require further testing.
