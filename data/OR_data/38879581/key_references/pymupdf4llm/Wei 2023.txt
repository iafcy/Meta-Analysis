**Background: Epidemiologic evidence on the relationships between air pollution and the risks of primary cancers other than**
lung ­cancer remained largely lacking. We aimed to examine associations of 10-year exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers.
**Methods: For each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort among the national Medicare beneficiaries during 2000 to 2016. We**
simultaneously examined the additive associations of six exposures, namely, moving average exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 over the
year of diagnosis and previous 2 years, previous 3 to 5 years, and previous 6 to 10 years, with the risk of first cancer diagnosis after
10 years of follow-up, during which there was no cancer diagnosis.
**Results: The cohorts included 2.2 to 6.5 million subjects for different cancers. Exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with**
increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2 was associated with a
decreased risk of breast cancer, while the association for PM2.5 remained inconclusive. At exposure levels below the newly updated
World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline, we observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the
risks of all cancers, which were translated to hundreds to thousands new cancer cases per year within the cohort per unit increase
in each exposure.
**Conclusions: These findings suggested substantial cancer burden was associated with exposures to PM2.5 and NO2, emphasizing**
the urgent need for strategies to mitigate air pollution levels.

##### Introduction

Outdoor air pollution is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease.[1] Outdoor air pollution is a complex mixture of
particles and irritant gases such as organic aerosols, heavy metals, and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).[2] Once inhaled, those pollutants
can penetrate deeper into the lungs and are carried by the bloodstream throughout the body. A recent global review showed that
chronic exposure to air pollution can affect almost every organ
in the body, causing a variety of diseases and conditions.[3]

In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer
identified air pollution as a group 1 carcinogen for lung cancer.[4]
For other cancers, genotoxicity and molecular biomarker data
from experimental studies demonstrated that air pollution is
associated with altered gene expressions, inflammation, and oxidative stress in tissues other than the lung, indicating potential
links between air pollution and the risk of developing various
types of cancers.[5–8] Epidemiologic evidence on air pollution and
other cancers remained largely lacking but was growing substantially in recent years.[9–12] Nevertheless, most existing studies
had relatively short follow-up periods and evaluated exposures
from one up to a few years before cancer diagnosis.[13–16] Due to
cancer’s long latency period, those studies might not be able to
adequately identify critical windows of susceptibility or capture
the full effect. Besides, previous studies were limited to small
unrepresentative samples, which was further complicated by
the heterogeneity in cancer.[17–19] Additionally, previous studies
had reported risks on a multiplicative scale, which obscured
the actual size of the risk and are more difficult to interpret

**What this study adds**
Although air pollution has been identified as a carcinogen for
lung cancer, the relation between air pollution and other primary cancers remained largely unquantified. We estimated the
simultaneous associations of 10-year exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the risks of
breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers among the
national Medicare cohort between 2000 and 2016. Our results
showed that PM2.5 and NO2 exposures increased the risks of
colorectal and prostate cancers. At low exposure levels, we
observed substantially larger associations between most expo

-----

compared with the additive effect estimates.[20] Further, the competing risk of death was pervasive but commonly overlooked,
leading to potential overestimation of the effect size.[21]
We aimed to examine the simultaneous associations of 10-year
exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and NO2, the two
major primary pollutants emitted directly from fossil fuel and
biomass combustion sources, on the risks of breast, prostate,
colorectal, and endometrial cancers, for national Medicare beneficiaries ≥65 years of age with continuous enrollment in the
Fee-for-Service (FFS) program and in the Medicare Parts A and
B. To provide a better sense of the risk posed by the pollutants,
we estimated additive associations and translated them to the
numbers of new cancer cases per unit increase in each exposure,
accounting for the competing risk of death.

##### Methods

_Study population and design_

We obtained the Medicare denominator file and the Medicare
Chronic Conditions Warehouse (CCW) from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services.[22] The Medicare denominator
file contained enrollment records and demographic information,
including sex, race/ethnicity, age, Medicaid enrollment status (a
marker of low socioeconomic status), ZIP code of residence,
and date of death (if any), for each Medicare beneficiary. Age,
Medicaid enrollment status, and ZIP code of residence were
updated annually. The CCW contained the date of the first
occurrence of cancer diagnosis for each cancer type across all
available claims in the FFS and the Medicare Parts A (inpatient) and B (outpatient, physician service, home health, etc.).
To reduce the chance of missing cancer diagnoses, we restricted
the cohort to beneficiaries with continuous enrollment in FFS
and in both Part A and Part B throughout the follow-up period.
This was because if a beneficiary spent any time in the Medicare
Advantage Plans (Part C), or only one of Parts A or B during
the study period, there was the possibility that the cancer claims
were not available for CCW.[23]
For each cancer, we constructed a separate cohort in which
each beneficiary was followed since 2000 or entering the study. To
allow for the assessment of the exposure effects over the 10 years
before cancer diagnosis, we implemented an inclusion criterion
that required a minimum follow-up period of 10 years after enrollment, during which no cancer diagnosis occurred. That is, we only
included beneficiaries who were cancer-free for the initial 10 years
of follow-up. By applying the 10-year cancer-free inclusion criterion, we also ensured that the first identified cancer diagnosis was
an incidence case. If a beneficiary had been diagnosed with cancer
before enrolling in Medicare, we believed they would have had
a claim record for physician visit, treatment, hospitalization, etc.
with cancer diagnosis within the first 10 years after study entry.
After that, beneficiaries were censored at the first occurrence of
cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of the study in 2016, whichever
occurred earliest. We restricted the cohort to females for breast
and endometrial cancers and males for prostate cancer.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Emory
University.

_Exposures_

We predicted daily average outdoor PM2.5 and NO2 levels at
1-km[2] grid cells across the contiguous US using geographically
weighted regressions that ensembled predictions from random
forests, gradient boosting, and neural network.[24–27] The predictions integrated multiple data sources including satellite data,
land-use variables, monitoring data, chemical transport model
simulations, etc. The ensembled models demonstrated better
predictive performance than that of the individual machine


learners with 10-fold cross-validated R-squared values of 0.89
for annual PM2.5 predictions and 0.84 for annual NO2 predictions. This performance was in held-out monitors not used for
model fitting. Based on these predictions at 1-km[2] grid cells and
ZIP code shapefiles provided by the Environmental Systems
Research Institute (ESRI), we estimated concentrations at ZIP
codes by averaging the predictions at grids whose centroids
were inside the polygonal area for general ZIP codes, or assigning the prediction at the nearest grid for other ZIP Codes that
did not have polygon representations, such as apartment buildings, military bases, or post offices.[28]
The ZIP code-level concentrations were considered as proxy
exposure measurements and were linked to each beneficiary in
each year based on their residential ZIP codes. For each beneficiary in each year, we examined three exposure windows: the
moving average exposure over that year and the previous two
years (lag 0–2 years), the moving average over the previous 3 to
5 years (lag 3–5 years), and the moving average over the previous 6 to 10 years (lag 6–10 years).

_Community-level covariates_

We included a variety of annual, ZIP code-level covariates in
the analysis as potential confounders and effect modifiers. The
percent of ever smokers, average body mass index (BMI), and
number of active medical doctors per 1000 people were derived
from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the
Area Health Resources Files.[29,30] The percent White, percent
Black, percent below poverty, percent rental housing, percent
education below high school, and median household income
were derived from the Decennial Census and the American
Community Survey.[31–33] The distance from the centroid of each
ZIP code to the nearest hospital was calculated based on the
ESRI’s hospital distribution files, which was considered as a
proxy for average distance to the nearest hospital.[34] The percent of Medicare beneficiaries with diabetes who had a lipid-panel test in a year and the percent beneficiaries with at least
one ambulatory doctor’s visit in a year were derived from the
Dartmouth Health Atlas.[35] Rurality, as measured by population
density, was derived from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and
Applications Center.[36] The Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI), a measure of greenness that was associated with
cancer incidence,[37] was obtained from the NASA’s Moderate
Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Land data products.[38]
The national Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a composite measure of neighborhood disadvantage level, was obtained from the
Neighborhood Atlas website.[39]

_Statistical analysis_

We had six exposures of interest, specifically lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to
5, and lag 6 to 10 exposures to PM2.5 and NO2. For each cancer
and each exposure, to obtain the independent effect estimate, we
employed an inverse probability weighting (IPW)-based additive model in which the other five exposures were adjusted as
confounders.[20,40] The analysis consisted of two stages: a design
stage where the inverse probability weight (IPW) of each person-year’s exposure was estimated to provide a scalar summary
that can be used to eliminate confounding and competing risk
through weighting, and an analysis stage where the additive
association of the exposure with the cancer risk was estimated.
In the first stage, the IPW (swi) for person-year _i was esti-_
mated by

_swi =_ _K (xi −_ _x¯)_ _gˆ (Di = 0|xi)_
_K (xi −_ _gˆ (xi|ci))_ _[×]_ _gˆ (Di = 0|xi,_ _ci)_ [,]


-----

where K (·) represented a kernel density estimator; _xi the expo-_
sure level; _x¯ the average exposure across all person-years; ci a_
set of confounders including the other five exposures, individual
risk factors (sex [male or female], race/ethnicity [White, Black,
or other], age group after initial 10-year cancer-free follow-up

[75–84 or ≥85 years], and Medicaid enrollment status [yes or
no]), and community-level covariates as delineated above; _Di_
the indicator of death (0 or 1); and _gˆ (·) a gradient boosting_
machine (GBM) prediction model with a gaussian loss function.[41] Overall, the above function incorporated the stabilized
IPWs for both confounding and competing risk of death. The
use of nonparametric algorithms of kernel density and GBM
had superior performance over parametric models in terms
of bias and flexibility: the kernel density function relaxed
the strong assumption of distributional form of the exposure
residuals, and the GBM captured all possible nonlinearity and
interactions of covariates and was unaffected by the potential
autocorrelation.[42,43] If the assumptions underlying the propensity score were met, this would provide a causal model.[40]
In the analysis stage, we fitted the following linear probability
model weighted by the IPWs obtained in the previous stage to
estimate the additive association of the exposure with the absolute cancer risk,

_E (Yi = 1|xi) = β0 + β1xi,_

where Yi was the outcome of cancer diagnosis (0 or 1). Given
the estimated association _β[ˆ]1, we further estimated the annual_
number of new cancer cases attributed to a unit increase in the
exposure by

_N_
Annual number of new cancer cases = β[ˆ]1 × Duration of study [,]

where _N was the total number of person-years of follow-up_
(including those of beneficiaries with cancer diagnoses in the
first 10 years of follow-up) and the duration of study was 17
years.
To examine whether the associations remained at low exposure levels, for PM2.5, we repeated the whole analysis for person-years with exposure levels at lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6
to 10 years all below 10 µg/m[3]; for NO2, we repeated the whole
analysis for person-years with exposure levels at lag 0 to 2, lag
3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years all below 20 parts per billion (ppb).
We further examined the associations at stricter exposure levels,
specifically the newly updated World Health Organization air
quality guidelines ([AQG]; 5 µg/m[3] for PM2.5 and 10 ppb for
NO2).[44]
To examine whether certain subpopulations and communities experienced higher cancer risk in the impact of air pollution,
we conducted separate analysis for each subgroup by age, sex
(for colorectal cancer only), race/ethnicity, ever enrollment in
Medicaid, and upper or lower quartile of community-level percent of ever smokers, average BMI, population density, and ADI.

##### Results

The cohorts had 3.8 million participants for breast cancer, 6.5
million for colorectal cancer, 4.0 million for endometrial cancer,
and 2.2 million for prostate cancer. The cohorts predominantly
consisted of Whites (>90%) and beneficiaries aged between
75 and 84 years (>80%) after initial 10-year cancer-free follow-up (Table 1). Beneficiaries excluded from the cohort due to
a cancer diagnosis, death, or end of the study within the first 10
years after the Medicare enrollment had larger population sizes,
higher numbers of cancer diagnoses, and lower proportions of

PM2.5 averaged 9.8 µg/m[3] and annual NO2 averaged 17.3 ppb
(Table 2). For general ZIP Codes that had polygon representations, the average distance from a ZIP Code centroid to its
boundary was ≈7.3 km; the fifth percentile corresponded to a
distance of 1.2 km, while the 95th percentile represented a distance of 17.5 km.
Results of the main analysis and low-level analysis are shown
in Table 3. For breast cancer, exposures to PM2.5 at lag 0 to 2
and lag 3 to 5 years were statistically and significantly associated with decreased cancer risk, while at lag 6 to 10 year, the
association was insignificant. Exposures to NO2 at lag 0 to
2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years were all associated with
increased breast cancer risk. In the low-level analysis in which
the analysis was restricted to exposure levels below 10 µg/m[3] for
PM2.5 and below 20 ppb for NO2, both pollutants across the lag
periods were associated with increased cancer risk. Notably, in
the below-AQG analysis in which the analysis was restricted to
exposure levels below 5 µg/m[3] for PM2.5 and below 10 ppb for
NO2, substantially larger positive associations were observed
for both pollutants across the lag periods. These additive assol d h d d h d f l

PM2.5 were larger than those for NO2. In the low-level analysis, associations for PM2.5 were slightly larger than those for
the main analysis, and for NO2 the associations attenuated with
increasing lag periods. In the below-AQG analysis, substantially
larger associations were observed for both pollutants, which
were translated to hundreds to thousands of newly diagnosed
colorectal cancer cases per year among the cohort.
For endometrial cancer, most associations were not statistically significant across the entire exposure ranges. However,
the lag 6 to 10 PM2.5 exposure was marginally and significantly
associated with decreased cancer risk. In the low-level and
below-AQG analyses, the associations for both pollutants attenuated with increasing lag periods.
For prostate cancer, all the exposures were associated with
increased cancer risk across the entire exposure ranges. In the
low-level analysis, all the effect sizes were larger compared with
those in the full exposure ranges. In the below-AQG analysis,
the associations became considerably larger, which were translated to hundreds to thousands of newly diagnosed prostate
cancer cases per year among the cohort.
Susceptibility among subpopulations was mostly inconsistent
across exposures and cancer types (Figure 1). For breast cancer,
those who ever enrolled in Medicaid experienced higher risk
associated with PM2.5 exposures over lag 3 to 5 and lag 6 to
10 years, and those who lived in ZIP codes with higher BMI
(>75th percentile) had higher risk for NO2 exposures at lag 0 to
2 and lag 3 to 5 years. For colorectal cancer, those who lived in
ZIP codes with higher rate of ever smokers (>75th percentile) or
average BMI (>75th percentile) had higher risk associated with
NO2 exposures at lag 0 to 2 and lag 3 to 5 years. For endometrial cancer, those who lived in ZIP codes with higher average
BMI (>75th percentile) were at a higher cancer risk associated
with lag 0 to 2 PM2.5 and lag 0 to 2 NO2 exposures. For prostate
cancer, Blacks were at a higher cancer risk associated with PM2.5
exposures across lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years, and
those who lived in ZIP codes with higher average BMI (>75th
percentile) had higher risk associated with NO2 exposures
across lag 0 to 2, lag 3 to 5, and lag 6 to 10 years.

##### Discussion

In this cohort study of millions of Medicare beneficiaries
across the contiguous US, we found clear evidence that chronic
exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 increased the risks of colorectal
and prostate cancers in a window of 10 years before diagnosis, consistent with the most recent epidemiological studies.[11,13,14,16,17,45–47] Compared with previous studies, our study
controlled for the competing risk of death, used propensity
score and an additive model that provided marginal estimates
of effect sizes, and found stronger associations at lower concentrations, including below the newly updated WHO guidelines.
In the main analysis, when considering the mutually adjusted
and independent additive effect estimates, the combined effects
over three exposure windows were substantial: for colorectal
cancer, an unit reduction in long-term PM2.5 and NO2 would
prevent at least 705 and 95 annual incident cases within the
cohort, respectively; for prostate cancer, an unit reduction in
long-term PM2.5 and NO2 would prevent at least 460 and 223
annual cases within the cohort, respectively. Given that the
effect sizes were considerably larger at exposure levels below
the newly updated WHO guidelines, further reducing the pollution levels would achieve greater health and economic benefits
by preventing more cancers. In contrast, there was little evidence
observed in our main analysis supporting the relevance of PM2.5
and NO2 exposures to endometrial cancer risk, consistent with
the Japan’s National Cancer Registry study.[12] However, in the
low-level and below-AQG analyses, the larger associations suggested that there may be stronger relations between lower levels
of PM2 5 and NO2 exposures and the risk of endometrial cancer,


and the concentration-response relations may follow a nonlinear pattern in an additive scale.
For breast cancer, the results can be interpreted as associations for postmenopausal breast cancer risk, considering that
the Medicare cohort consisted of individuals aged 75 years or
older at the time of diagnosis. In accord with Crouse et al.[48] and
Poulsen et al.[13] who investigated the postmenopausal women,
we found that NO2 was negatively associated with breast cancer incidence. Evidence for PM2.5 was less clear. Consistent with
several large cohort studies,[15,16,18,49–51] we detected both positive
and negative association for PM2.5 across the entire exposure
range. The mixed associations in our study and the previous
studies may be due to the heterogeneous changes in chemical
compositions and sources of PM2.5.[19] The difference in PM2.5
compositions may also explain the more varying results for
PM2.5 than those for NO2. However, when restricting the analysis to lower exposure levels, where the compositions of local
PM2.5 remained fairly stable,[52] we found strongly and consistently adverse impacts of PM2.5. Clearly, future studies with data
on PM2.5 compositions are needed to explore the relations of
specific chemical components with breast cancer risk. Similar to
endometrial cancer, the substantially larger associations in the
low-level and below-AQG analyses indicated that the effect of
air pollution on breast cancer risk may be more pronounced at
lower exposure levels.
Few studies had explored the potential impact of individualand community-level factors on the susceptibility of cancer to
air pollution.[53] In this study, we found inconsistent subgroup
differences across exposures and cancer types, possibly due to
the complex etiology of different cancers.[9] However, we found
suggestive evidence indicating a disproportionately higher risk of
all the cancers associated with NO2 exposures among individuals residing in communities with higher average BMI, suggesting
that a lack of access to healthy food and limited opportunities
for physical activities may contribute to an increased cancer susceptibility to the adverse effect of NO2.[54] The finding of greater
susceptibility of the Medicaid enrollees and Blacks to the PM2.5induced cancer risks was also important in terms of improving
health equity. Blacks had been exposed to higher levels of air
pollution,[55] so the larger effect sizes resulted in an even greater
injustice.
Our study had several strengths. First, the inclusion of millions
of participants with long-term follow-up allowed for investigating the exposures later in life, from up to 10 years before cancer
diagnosis, with ample statistical power. Second, the independent
and additive associations made it possible to combine them to
obtain the overall estimates for a window of 10 years before
cancer diagnosis. As a result, adding up the individual effect
estimates for each pollutant was a straightforward and valid
approach that provided a better sense of its long-term impact.
Third, the use of GBM and kernel density estimator achieved a
high level of flexibility and accuracy for estimating IPW, making the results robust against any observed confounding bias.
Fourth, accounting for competing risk avoided the associations
being overestimated.
This study also had limitations. First, restricted by available
data sources, we could not capture individual-level risk factors
such as smoking status and BMI, but used community-level
smoking rate and average BMI as surrogates, which may lead
to confounding bias. For breast cancer, it is important to note
that reproductive factors and the use of hormone therapy
were not available for the analysis.[56] For colorectal cancer,
the analysis did not account for alcohol consumption, a recognized risk factor.[57] While these factors may not be directly
associated with air pollution exposures and therefore may not
confound the association between air pollution and cancer
incidence, incorporating them in future research can still contribute to obtaining more robust effect estimates. Second, the
use of ZIP code-level exposures was subject to measurement

error, especially for NO2, which has greater spatial variability.[58] However, the larger ZIP codes were generally in less populated and rural areas, where the spatial variability in NO2
exposure may be smaller than in urban areas, where the ZIP
codes are smaller. This may limit, but not eliminate, the exposure error. A recent simulation study suggested that correcting
for exposure measurement error would lead to larger effect
estimates.[59] Third, participants in our study were restricted to
Medicare beneficiaries with continuous enrollment in both FFS
program and Part A and B, which may limit generalizability
to the total elderly population. Fourth, restricting the analysis
to only beneficiaries who were cancer-free for the initial 10
years of follow-up may introduce selection bias, considering
the demographic differences between the analysis group and
excluded group. There was a possibility that the beneficiaries
who developed cancer during the initial 10 years might be
more susceptible to the effects of air pollution. In this case,
overlooking those beneficiaries could lead to the associations
being underestimated.

##### Conclusions

Our study of the national Medicare cohort investigated additive associations of 10-year exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 with
the risks of breast, prostate, colorectal, and endometrial cancers. We found that exposures to PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with increased risks of colorectal and prostate cancers,
but were not associated with endometrial cancer risk. NO2
was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, while the
f d l l


levels, in particular below the newly updated WHO AQG, we
observed substantially larger associations between most exposures and the risks of all cancers. The observed additive associations resulted in a substantial number of newly diagnosed
cancer cases per year within the cohorts, ranging from hundreds
to thousands for each unit increase in exposure. These findings
suggested substantial cancer burden associated with exposures
to PM2.5 and NO2, emphasizing the urgent need for strategies to
mitigate air pollution levels.
