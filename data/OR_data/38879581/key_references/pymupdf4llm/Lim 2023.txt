BACKGROUND
Lung and bladder cancers are significant causes of mortality and
morbidity in Australia and worldwide [1–3]. Ambient air pollution
is a known lung carcinogen and possible bladder carcinogen, but
the risk in regions with low pollution is unclear.

Ambient air pollution and lung cancer
Lung cancer is the fifth highest cancer diagnosis and a leading
cause of cancer-attributable mortality in Australia [2]. Whilst
tobacco smoking remains the strongest known risk factor for lung
cancer, international studies have observed that the proportion of
non-smoking-related lung cancers is increasing [4–7]. Ambient air
pollution may be contributing to this increase [8, 9]. In 2013,
ambient air pollution and particulate matter, independently, were
classified as Group 1 carcinogens for lung cancer by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [10]. The
relationship has been confirmed in further meta-analyses [11–13].
Some studies have observed increased lung cancer risks in regions
where pollution concentrations were below the region-specific air

||BACKGROUND: Air pollution is a cause of lung cancer and is associated with bladder cancer. However, the relationship between air pollution and these cancers in regions of low pollution is unclear. We investigated associations between fine particulate matter (PM ), nitrogen dioxide, and black carbon (BC), and both these cancers in a low-pollution city. 2.5 METHODS: A cohort of 11,679 men ≥65 years old in Perth (Western Australia) were followed from 1996–1999 until 2018. Pollutant concentrations, as a time-varying variable, were estimated at participants’ residential addresses using land use regression models. Incident lung and bladder cancer were identified through the Western Australian Cancer Registry.

RESULTS: Lung cancer was associated with PM and BC in the adjusted single-pollutant models. A weak positive association was 2.5 observed between ambient air pollution and squamous cell lung carcinoma but not lung adenocarcinoma. Positive associations were observed with bladder cancer, although these were not statistically significant. Associations were attenuated in two-pollutant models.

quality guidelines, and suggested that even low concentrations of
air pollution increase the risk of lung cancer [14–19]. However,
other studies in low-pollution regions have not shown an
increased risk [20–22].
The association between other pollutants and lung cancer is
less clear. Significant associations between nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
and lung cancer have been identified in regions in Europe [23–25],
and North America [16, 19, 26], but the data are not consistent

[14, 27, 28]. No associations were observed for studies conducted
in China [29], Korea [30, 31], and Iran [32]. Studies between black
carbon (BC) and lung cancer have also produced inconsistent
results [14, 23, 25, 33].
Some studies have investigated associations between pollutants and histological lung cancer subtypes, such as adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but these are
conflicting [14, 18, 23]. Significant associations were observed
between (fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and adenocarcinoma, but
not other subtypes [14, 18]; however, further studies are required

[12, 34]. No association was observed between NO2 and SCC or

adenocarcinoma [14, 30], while studies investigating other air
pollutants and different histological subtypes of lung cancer have
also found that there were no significant associations [14, 23].

Ambient air pollution and bladder cancer
Bladder cancer accounts for approximately 2.0% of all new cancer
diagnoses in Australia [3]. In 2013, the IARC concluded that there
was a possible association between air pollution and bladder
cancer, but epidemiological evidence was limited [10]. Associations between PM2.5 and bladder cancer have been observed

[20, 27, 35–37], but most of these were not statistically significant.
No association between PM2.5 and bladder cancer was reported in
a pooled cohort study in Europe [38]. Studies investigating
associations between NO2 or BC and bladder cancer are scarce. No
associations between NO2 and bladder cancer were observed in
studies conducted in Europe [36, 37] and the United State of
America (USA) [27]. Similarly, no association between BC and
bladder cancer was observed in recent studies in Europe [36, 38].
The evidence that a broad range of adverse health effects
occurring in regions of low concentrations of pollution is
increasing, which resulted in the World Health Organization
(WHO) lowering their targets for several air pollutants in the 2021
publication of The WHO Air Quality Guidelines [9]. However, the
cancer risks of low-pollution exposure remain unclear. Ambient air
pollution in Australian metropolitan cities is generally low [39]
and, therefore, conducting studies in Australia provides an
opportunity to study cancer incidence in a low-pollution region.
Our primary aims were to investigate whether exposures to low
concentrations of air pollutants, specifically PM2.5, NO2, and BC,
were associated with an increased risk of lung and bladder cancer
incidence in older men (≥65 years). Our secondary aim was to
investigate if exposures to these pollutants were associated with
histological subtypes of lung cancer, specifically adenocarcinoma
and SCC.

METHODS
Study design and participants
Participants were members of an ongoing cohort study, the Health In Men
Study (HIMS) [40]. The HIMS recruited 12,203 men aged between 65 and 84
years old, living in metropolitan Perth, the capital city of Western Australia
(WA), from April 1996 to January 1999 [40]. The men were recruited from
the Australian electoral roll; voting is compulsory in Australia and all
Australian citizens ≥18 years are required to register on the electoral roll.
The HIMS have been followed since 1996, both actively (questionnaires
and health assessments) and passively (via the WA Data Linkage Systems
(WADLS)) [40]. Using the WADLS, the cohort is linked to several health data
collections including the WA Cancer Registry and Mortality Register.
Written consent was obtained by all participants, and ethics approval was
granted by the Department of Health WA Human Research Ethics
Committee, and the University of WA Human Research Ethics Committee.

Assessment of exposure
We estimated concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and BC at each participants’
household address at recruitment using validated Land Use Regression
(LUR) models, which are described in detail elsewhere [41, 42].
The development of LUR models followed the protocols of the ESCAPE
study [43]. Extensive seasonal air monitoring of PM2.5, NO2 and BC
across the Perth Metropolitan area was conducted in 2012, through a
purpose-designed air monitoring campaign. The LUR models were
developed to predict the measured concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and BC
from environmental predictor variables, including road traffic type and
volume, open green spaces, land use, buildings, population density, as
well as water bodies [42]. The LUR models were in turn used to predict
the air pollution concentrations at each participants’ household
recruitment address.
Concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 from 1995 to 2011 were estimated
through back-extrapolation, based on the 2012 LUR model and the fixed
air monitoring sites in Perth Metropolitan region, maintained by the WA
Department of Water and Environmental Regulation. Exposure estimates


from 2013 to 2019 were calculated using a similar method but with
forward-extrapolation from the LUR model. Extrapolation of LUR models to
predict pollutant concentrations up to 17 years earlier and 5–10 years later
has been used and validated in other studies [44–46]. Concentrations were
obtained for each pollutant at each participants’ address for each year of
the study.
Although PM2.5 and NO2 measures were available from fixed monitoring
sites, BC was not directly measured and available. To obtain BC estimates for
extrapolation, temporal NO2 concentration ratios were used as a proxy for
temporal changes to BC, as the concentration of BC and NO2 were correlated
(r = 0.7). The method to obtain these is described elsewhere [42].
For the analyses, exposures to PM2.5, NO2 and BC were considered in a
continuous, time-varying manner, where the average annual pollutant
concentration was allowed to vary for each year of follow-up, i.e., a oneyearly moving average, from the year of recruitment to either the outcome
of interest, death, or the end of follow-up, whichever occurred first.

Assessment of outcome
Incident lung and bladder cancer cases diagnosed between 1996 and
December 2018 were ascertained by data linkage to the WA Cancer
Registry, which records all cases of cancer in WA (see Supplementary
Methods) [47]. The respective International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3) topography codes were C34.0–34.9 for
malignant lung cancer, and C67.0–67.9 for malignant bladder cancer. For
those with multiple lung or bladder cancers, only the first malignant cancer
was included in their respective cohorts. Participants with a diagnosis of
lung and bladder cancer prior to recruitment were excluded from these
analyses. We also excluded metastatic lung and bladder cancer.
Participants with other cancer types were included in the study.
Two histological subtypes of lung cancer were investigated, categorised
by ICD-O-3 histology codes. These were: SCC (8051–8084) and adenocarcinoma (8140–8149, 8160–8162, 8190–8221, 8260–8337, 8350–8351,
8570–8576, 8940–8941). These subtypes accounted for 50% of all lung
cancers observed. Other histological groups of lung cancer (including basal
cell carcinoma, other specific carcinomas, unspecified carcinomas and
sarcomas and soft tissue tumours) were not studied separately, as there
were too few events.

Other variables
Data were collected at recruitment using questionnaires and health
assessments, and the following baseline data were considered for analyses:
age, height and weight, socioeconomic status (SES) and the self-reported
variables: country of birth, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical
activity [40]. The SES was based on residential postcodes and determined
through the Socio-Economic Indices For Areas, an index which was
developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics [48]. To determine which
potentially confounding variables to adjust for, we developed Direct
Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) on variables based upon the literature [14, 40], and
[used the online platform http://www.dagitty.net/ (DAGitty version 3.0,](http://www.dagitty.net/)
Nijmegen, NL). These are described in Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2. For
lung cancer, the minimal adjustment set was participant age and SES, and
for bladder cancer, the minimal adjustment set was age, SES and smoking
status. Smoking status was also included in the analysis for lung cancer, as
it is the strongest known risk factor for lung cancer [2]. Details of these
covariates are presented in the Supplementary Methods.

Statistical methods and data analyses
Of the 12,203 participants in the original HIMS, because our air pollution
estimates were restricted to the Perth Metropolitan Area, 476 men were
excluded for this reason (Supplementary Fig. S3). A further 48 participants
were excluded due to missing data on smoking status (n = 43) and SES
(n = 5), leaving 11,679 study participants. For the lung cancer analyses, we
excluded participants with lung cancer diagnosed prior to HIMS
recruitment (n = 62), leaving 11,617 participants for this analysis. Similarly,
for bladder cancer, participants with previous diagnoses (n = 52) were
excluded, leaving 11,627 participants for the bladder cancer analysis.
Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, with age as the timescale,
were used to model the association of pollutant concentrations, on both
lung and bladder cancer incidence. Separate models were performed for
lung and bladder cancers, and the event of interest was the time of the
first primary cancer of interest. For each respective cancer analysis,
participants without the event were censored at either their date of death
or at the end of the follow-up period of 31 December 2018, whichever

occurred first. Mortality data were available from the WA mortality register.
Both lung and bladder cancer models were adjusted for baseline area-level
SES and smoking status. As there is evidence that smoking may be an
effect modifier in the relationship between air pollution and lung cancer

[14, 15, 22, 35], we also ran models stratifying by smoking status. In these
stratified models, we provide estimates of the relationships between each
pollutant and cancer outcome for each smoking status strata.
Two-pollutant models were developed for PM2.5, NO2 and BC. That is, for
each pollutant (PM2.5, NO2 or BC), we also adjusted for each of the other
two pollutants, in separate models. All two-pollutant models were also
adjusted for baseline SES and smoking status.
The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using plots of
Schoenfeld residuals, and no violations were detected. To allow for nonlinearity in the relationship between each pollutant and each cancer
outcome, we considered models where each pollutant was entered as a


restricted cubic spline with three knots. Knot locations were determined by
the recommendations in Harrell [49]. When modelling non-linear relationships, it is not appropriate to present a single hazard ratio (HR), as the HR is
not constrained to be constant across the exposure range as seen when
modelling a linear relationship. As we have modelled the relationship
between air pollutants and incident cancers non-linearly, we report HRs
and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for multiple pollutant concentrations occurring within the concentration range observed in our study,
when compared with a reference, also within our study range. This helps to
describe how the relationship may change over the range of pollutant
concentrations. Specifically, PM2.5 concentrations of 3, 5, and 7 µg/m[3] are
compared with a reference value of 1 µg/m[3], NO2 concentrations of 10, 15,
and 25 µg/m[3] are compared with a reference value of 5 µg/m[3], and BC
concentrations of 0.8 × 10[−][5], 1.2 × 10[−][5], and 1.6 × 10[−][5] m[−][1] are compared
with a reference value of 0.5 × 10[−][5] m[−][1].
Five sets of sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first was assigning a
baseline pollutant exposure to all participants. This was the average
concentration of each pollutant during the participant’s recruitment year.
Current studies have used baseline concentrations to estimate participant
exposures to ambient air pollutants [14, 38, 43]. This analysis would enable
us to compare our findings with other studies that have used similar
exposure measures, as well as with comparing with the use of time-varying
measures in our study.
When using age as the timescale, comparisons are made between
participants at specific ages, as opposed to specific calendar years of
exposure. As such, we conducted a sensitivity analysis which included an
interaction between birth cohort (birth years 1914–1924 and 1925–1932)
and each air pollutant to see whether the impact of air pollution on lung
and bladder cancer differed for those born at different times.
The third set of sensitivity analyses excluded participants who had a
lung or bladder cancer diagnosis in the first two years of follow-up, in
addition to those who were excluded due to diagnoses prior to
recruitment. This factored in lung or bladder cancer cases at baseline that
may have had delayed diagnosis or registration to the WA Cancer Registry.
Exposure estimates were based on residential addresses at the time of
recruitment, thus assuming that all participants had lived at the same
residential address the whole time, and as such, a fourth set of analyses
was done to exclude participants who had moved addresses (‘movers’)
during the follow-up period. Participants who had moved addresses from
the baseline during the study were recorded in the HIMS dataset.
Finally, we also included all available covariates from the DAGs in the
primary analyses to assess the robustness of our models.
All analyses were performed using Stata software package 17.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX).

RESULTS
Study population characteristics
Baseline demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the study
participants are presented in Table 1. The mean age at baseline
was 72.1 (SD ± 4.4) years old. Most participants had high arealevel SES (64%) and were former smokers (59.6%). Most of the
former smokers had quit more than 10 years prior to
recruitment.

Air pollutant concentrations of study population
Average concentrations in the starting year of the study (1996)
were: 5.65 µg/m[3] for PM2.5, 15.83 µg/m[3] for NO2, and
1.06 × 10[−][5] m[−][1] for BC. Average concentrations at the end of
the study (2018) were: 4.35 µg/m[3] for PM2.5, 11.20 µg/m[3] for NO2,
and 0.81 × 10[−][5] m[−][1] for BC. Further distributional information is
described in Supplementary Table S1. Pairwise correlations
between the three pollutants at recruitment all had Spearman’s
rho (r) <0.7 (Supplementary Table S2). Participants with cancer
events had slightly higher mean concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and
BC, compared to those who did not have the respective cancer
event at recruitment (Table 2).

Associations between ambient air pollutants and lung cancer
There were 692 (6.0%) lung cancer events identified during
the study period, with a total follow-up time of 158,479
person-years.

Positive associations between the pollutants and lung cancer
were observed in both crude and adjusted models (Table 3). In the
adjusted single-pollutant model, HRs for PM2.5 and BC, but not
NO2, were mostly statistically significant. In the two-pollutant


models, the results for PM2.5 were attenuated, and lost statistical
significance, when controlling, separately, for NO2 and BC. The
results for BC were attenuated when controlling for PM2.5 but not
for NO2, but stayed statistically significant.

Ambient air pollution and lung cancer histological subtypes
In the lung cancer cohort, there were 138 (1.2%) SCCs and 201 (1.7%)
adenocarcinomas of the lung reported during follow-up (Table 4).
Concentrations of PM2.5 and BC of participants were positively
associated with both SCC and adenocarcinoma, across the unadjusted
and adjusted single-pollutant models, although these were not
significant. The HRs in the respective two-pollutant models were
further attenuated, except for BC when controlled for NO2.
Concentrations of NO2 were positively associated with SCC, but not
ADC in the single-pollutant models. No associations between incident
lung cancer and NO2 were observed across all two-pollutant models.

Associations between ambient air pollutants and bladder
cancer
There were 224 incident bladder cancer events (1.9%), during 158,440
person-years of follow-up. Concentrations of PM2.5 and BC were
positively associated with bladder cancer in their respective single
and two-pollutant models, although these were not statistically
significant (Table 3). A weak positive association was observed
between NO2 and bladder cancer in single-pollutant models;
however, this was attenuated when adjusted for other co-pollutants.
We observed evidence of a non-linear relationship between
pollutants and both lung and bladder cancer (Fig. 1).


Stratification by smoking status
When stratified by smoking status, positive associations were
observed between all pollutants and lung cancer for the former
smokers’ group who had quit smoking ≥10 years ago in the singlepollutant models, but not consistently in other smoking groups
(Supplementary Table S3). Bladder cancer estimates were
relatively consistent across the different smoking cohorts.

Sensitivity analyses
Baseline pollutant exposure. For lung cancer, the HRs associated
with baseline concentrations of PM2.5 and BC remained mostly
significant in the crude and adjusted single-pollutant models
(Supplementary Table S4). A positive, but non-significant, association was observed between incident lung cancer and NO2 in the
single-pollutant models. Positive associations between baseline
exposures of PM2.5 and BC and incident bladder cancer were also
observed, but not with NO2. In the lung cancer histological
subtype analysis, the incidence of SCC was positively associated
with baseline concentrations of all pollutants in the crude and
adjusted single-pollutant models; however, the confidence intervals were very wide (Supplementary Table S5). Positive associations were also observed between incident lung adenocarcinoma
with PM2.5 and BC, but not with NO2. Evidence of a non-linear

relationship was observed between ambient air pollutants, and
both lung and bladder cancer (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Birth cohort. For both lung and bladder cancer analyses, no
significant interactions were observed between ambient air
pollutants and the birth cohorts (all p values > 0.09).

Two-year cancer exclusion. The overall findings were similar when
participants with incident lung or bladder cancer in the first 2
years of follow-up were excluded (Supplementary Table S6).

Excluding movers. The associations between PM2.5, NO2 and BC
and both lung and bladder cancer remained similar after


excluding participants who had moved residential addresses
during the follow-up period (Supplementary Table S7).

Inclusion of all covariates in the primary analyses. We also did not
observe significant changes in associations when other available
covariates were added to the models (Supplementary Table S8).

DISCUSSION
We observed positive associations between follow-up exposures
to PM2.5, NO2 and BC, and both incident lung and bladder cancer.
The concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 in this study were low and,
on average, below Australian air quality standards (current annual


-----

average thresholds are 8 µg/m[3] and 15 ppb (≈28 µg/m[3]), respectively [39]), and lower than has been reported in other ‘lowpollution’ studies [14–19, 35, 36].
The range of exposure concentrations for each pollutant
reported in our study was narrow. The annual average concentrations (and range) during follow-up for: PM2.5 was 4.63 µg/m[3]

(0.01–9.20 µg/m[3]), NO2 was 13.59 µg/m[3] (0.82–29.02 µg/m[3]), and
BC was 0.98 × 0.5 × 10[−][5] m[−][1] (0.08–2.03 × 10[−][5] m[−][1]). Our findings
support the notion that there may not be a threshold concentration for the carcinogenic effects of ambient air pollution.

Lung cancer and PM2.5
The associations between PM2.5 and lung cancer were consistent
with recent studies conducted in the USA [15, 35], Canada [17–19],
and Europe [14, 50], where an increase in lung cancer risk was
observed with relatively low concentrations of PM2.5 exposures. For
example, the ELAPSE study [14], a pooled cohort of seven countries
in Europe, reported a median annual concentration of 15.4 µg/m[3],
and a pooled-HR of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.05–1.23) per 5 µg/m[3] increase in
PM2.5. Studies in Canada with lower exposure concentrations
reported HRs of 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01–1.05) per 5.3 µg/m[3] [19], 1.16
(95% CI: 1.07–1.25) per 10 µg/m[3] [17], and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.10–1.65)
per 10 µg/m[3] [18], where average respective PM2.5 concentrations
were 7.68 µg/m[3] (mean), 7.4 µg/m[3] (mean), and 9.1 µg/m[3] (median).
On the other hand, the Biobank study [50] in the United Kingdom
(UK) reported a high HR of 1.63 (95% CI: 1.33–2.01) per 5 µg/m[3]

increase in PM2.5 with mean PM2.5 concentration of 10 µg/m[3].
Recent studies (with a wider exposure range) have suggested that
the relative risk of lung cancer (with each incremental increase in
pollutant) may be greater at lower concentrations of PM2.5,
compared to higher concentrations [14, 17, 19]. Because of
the narrow exposure range in our study, we could not investigate
this further.

Lung cancer and NO2 and BC
The association between ambient NO2 and lung cancer has
regularly been observed [16, 19, 23–26, 29–32, 50, 51], although
not in all studies [27, 28]. In regions with low NO2, significant
associations with lung cancer have been found in studies
conducted in the Netherlands [23–25], the UK [50], the USA [26],
and Canada [16, 19]. The average concentrations of NO2 reported
in these studies were below European Air Quality Standards of
<40 µg/m[3] [52]. In our study, the NO2 concentrations were below
the Australian standard of 28 µg/m[3]. We observed non-significant
associations between NO2 and lung cancer, which was a similar
finding to a pooled analysis of European cohorts in relatively lowpollution areas (HR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.97–1.07) [14].
We observed significant associations between BC and lung
cancer in all models. There is currently a paucity of studies on BC
and lung cancer. We identified three studies and one pooled
analysis that investigated associations between BC and lung
cancer [14, 23, 25, 33]. Two studies found significant associations
with lung cancer; [23, 25] the multi-centre European ELAPSE Study
did not find an association between lung cancer and BC [14], and
the French Gazel Cohort Study [33] reported non-statistically
significant associations between lung cancer and BC. Given the
limited studies, further research is needed to better understand
potential associations.
In 2012, the IARC declared diesel engine exhaust as a Group 1
human carcinogen [53]. Ambient BC is a common proxy for diesel

[54] and, therefore, our findings may reflect the association
between diesel engine exhaust and lung cancer. In Australia, the
proportion of cars that are diesel powered is growing steadily and
accounts for over 26% of all motor vehicles in this country [55].
Despite efforts to reduce total emissions in ambient air, there is a
growing trend towards driving diesel-powered sports utility and
utility vehicles, leading to greater production of tail-pipe
pollutants [56].


Whilst positive associations were observed between both NO2
and BC and lung cancer, when analysed together, a positive, but
non-significant association, with lung cancer remained with BC
but not with NO2. This suggests that the association of NO2 with
lung cancer is in part reflecting the effects of BC. The HRs were
stronger when NO2 was included in the model with BC,
suggesting there may be additive effects. As both NO2 and BC
are produced from traffic-related pollution, they are often present
together [33].

Air pollutants and lung cancer histological subtypes
The relationship between histological subtypes of lung cancer and
ambient air pollution remains unclear. Positive associations were
observed between BC and both SCC and adenocarcinoma, across
both single and two-pollutant models. Positive, but non-significant, associations were also observed for PM2.5 and both
histological lung cancer subtypes in the single-pollutant models.
The effects were attenuated in the two-pollutant models,
particularly for lung adenocarcinoma. Concentrations of NO2 were
positively associated with increasing risk of SCC; however, effects
were also attenuated after controlling for other pollutants. No
associations were observed for NO2 with adenocarcinoma.
Our findings contrast the results from previous studies, where
stronger associations between PM2.5 and adenocarcinoma have
been observed, compared with other lung cancer subtypes

[18, 43]. The ELAPSE study also observed associations between
PM2.5 and adenocarcinoma, but not with SCC [14]. However, no
associations were observed between NO2 or BC, with either
adenocarcinoma and SCC [14]. Hart et al. [23]. also reported no
associations for between different histological subtypes of lung
cancer, and either NO2 or black smoke. These studies used singlepollutant models and did not adjust for co-pollutants. The risk of
incident SCC (and not adenocarcinoma) was not found to be
associated with PM2.5, NO2 and BC in previous studies.

Bladder cancer and PM2.5, NO2 and BC
There was a positive association between PM2.5 and bladder
cancer, although this was not statistically significant. This is
consistent with the multi-centre European study, the ELAPSE
Study [36], where a positive but non-significant association was
identified. Positive associations between ambient air pollution and
bladder cancer were also described in the report by IARC in 2013

[10] and in a more recent study in the USA [27]. However, no
associations were observed for other studies conducted in Spain

[37], the USA [35], and another pooled multi-cohort study in
Europe [38].
Exposures to NO2 were not associated with bladder cancer,
which is consistent with existing literature. No associations with
bladder cancer were reported in studies in Spain [37], the USA

[27], and a multi-centre European study [38]. However, a positive,
albeit non-significant, association was observed with BC across all
pollutant models. This differed from the ELAPSE Study [36], where
no association between BC and bladder cancer was reported. We
observed that NO2 and BC were not independent of each other,
and the presence of both in the co-pollutant analysis resulted in
attenuation of their respective effects on bladder cancer.

Baseline pollutant exposures
Associations using baseline exposures for ambient air pollutants
were similar to the time-varying exposures, for both lung and
bladder cancer analyses. The pattern of associations between
baseline concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and BC and both respective
cancers remained consistent in the sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). The use of pollutant exposures
estimated at residential home addresses at the time of recruitment as a measure of long-term pollutant exposure is a common
method used in the literature to examine risk of chronic health
effects [14, 38, 43]. However, assigning time-varying exposures


-----

provides a more precise assignment and enables a greater
detection in the effect measure, which may be more important
in low-level air pollution studies. A Canadian study investigating
low-level ambient air pollution and mortality also observed
differences in these effect measures, and suggested that timevarying estimates for these studies are important, particularly for
pollutants with high spatial resolution [16]. However, the ELAPSE
Study observed minimal difference in effect measures with
different exposure metrics including baseline, annual average,
and time-varying concentrations in their sensitivity analyses [14].

Stratified by smoking status
We observed modest effect modification by smoking status in the
lung cancer analysis, and this has also been observed in the
literature [14, 15, 22, 35]. Positive associations between lung
cancer and ambient air pollutants were observed in the group that
had quit smoking ≥10 years ago, but not the never-smoker group.
Positive associations have been observed in studies between lung
cancer and PM2.5 in never-smokers [14, 15]. Another study
observed positive associations when analysis was restricted to
participants who had never smoked, or had quit ≥10 years ago

[22]. A recent meta-analysis also found a higher risk of lung cancer
with PM2.5 in never and former smokers, compared to current
smokers; however, the results were imprecise [12]. Another study
found PM2.5-associated lung cancer mortality was higher in the
never-smokers cohort (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.20–2.49) compared
to the full cohort (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.00–1.26) [35].
Smoking status did not modify the effect of ambient air
pollutants and bladder cancer in our study. Our findings were
similar to other studies, where a non-significant interaction
between smoking status [36] and pack-years smoked [37] was
observed with ambient air pollutants.

Strengths and limitations
Our study had several strengths. The follow-up time of 22 years
was suitable for lung and bladder cancer, which both have long
latency periods. Analysing data from an older-aged cohort is a
consideration of a population particularly vulnerable to the health
effects of hazardous air pollution. The HIMS is linked to the WADLS
and follow-up data for all participants were available through data
linkage, including to state hospital records and mortality registry.
Reporting cancer diagnoses to the WA Cancer Registry is also a
mandatory requirement for WA health practitioners [47]. The
WADLS has stringent checking procedures, with low rates of errors
in their datasets [57]. Tracking all participants reduced the
potential for attrition bias that may occur from loss to follow-up.
The validated LUR models had good performance, and could
explain variability in PM2.5, NO2 and BC concentrations in Perth by
approximately 67%, 69% and 85%, respectively [41, 42]. However,
whilst LUR models have been used and validated for back- and
forward-extrapolation in previous studies, we did not have
validation data to justify the extrapolation of our models for
Perth (WA).
The HIMS cohort only included older, mainly Caucasian men,
limiting generalisability. Many studies in the literature have used
large-scale cohorts (such as populations across multiple countries
and sites [14, 50]), and have drawn from national or state-wide
administrative and health surveillance databases [17–19, 35].
These studies include both middle and older-aged adults, and
both males and females, resulting in a greater heterogeneity of
participants. Female-only studies have also been conducted, such
as participants recruited from the Canadian National Breast
Screening Study [18]. In contrast, the HIMS cohort was originally
recruited for a randomised screening trial for Abdominal Aortic
Aneurysms [40], and included older-aged men from a single
city only.
Although we reported a large number of lung cancer events,
the case counts for bladder cancer and histological subtypes of


lung cancer were relatively fewer. This could limit the statistical
power of these analyses. Whilst our sample size was relatively
small compared to other studies, our cohort was a subset of the
population most vulnerable to lung (and bladder) cancers.
Evaluating lesser-known cancer risk factors such as air pollution
was, therefore, suitable and relevant for our cohort.
Pollution estimates were from residential addresses and did not
consider where they spent their time. Personal exposure to air
pollution is dependent on the day-to-day microenvironments of
the individual, which include both indoor and outdoor exposures
at their home [58].
Other residual confounding for lung cancer risk may not have
been considered. For example, the UK Biobank Study observed
that genetic factors could increase the effect of ambient air
pollution on lung cancer by 50% [50]. Genetic factor analyses were
outside the study scope. Finally, confounding was determined at
recruitment; hence, lifestyle changes (such as smoking status)
during follow-up were not considered.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we found an increased risk of lung and possible
increase of bladder cancer in a cohort of older men in Perth, WA,
residing in areas where ambient air pollution concentrations are
typically considered very low. This adds to the increasing evidence
that negative health effects are being identified at low concentrations of air pollution. Further studies are needed to understand
the carcinogenic potential of ambient air pollution at low
concentrations.
