Abstract: Increased particulate matter (PM) exposure is positively associated with increased incidence and mortality
of many human malignancies. However, evidence of urologic cancer is limited. We aimed to evaluate the association
between PM10 exposure and the relative risk of urologic cancer. This nationwide longitudinal cohort study included
231,997 participants who underwent a baseline health examination in 2008 from the National Health Information
Database of Korea. The primary endpoint was newly diagnosed urologic cancer according to PM10 exposure. Of the
total 231,99 participants, 50,677 developed urologic cancer during a median follow-up of 6.7 years. After control­
ling for confounding factors, participants in the high PM10 exposure group had a higher risk of kidney cancer (hazard
ratio [HR] 1.111, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.068-1.157) and prostate cancer (HR 1.083, 95% CI 1.058-1.109)
than those in the low PM10 exposure group. However, in urothelial cell carcinoma, there was no significant increase
in the HRs in the high PM10 exposure group. For kidney cancer, participants with the following characteristics were
more susceptible: age < 65 years, female sex, decreased regular physical activity, current smoking, no diabetes, no
hypertension, normal body mass index, and desirable total cholesterol level. For prostate cancer, participants with
the following characteristics were more susceptible: decreased regular physical activity, current smoking, and no
hypertension. High PM10 exposure is associated with an increased risk of overall urologic cancers, especially kidney
and prostate cancer.

Introduction

Air pollution has been associated with detri­
mental effects on human health including
increased risk of premature mortality, cardio­
vascular and respiratory diseases, adverse
birth outcomes, and several cancers [1, 2]. The
World Health Organization has reported that
ambient air pollution and household air pollu­
tion are associated with 7 million premature
deaths annually, and has declared air pollution
as the “silent killer” [3]. Air pollution is a
complex mixture of pollutants including sulfur
oxides, nitrogen oxides, ambient ozone, and
particulate matter (PM). PM, a mixture of toxic
and carcinogenic substances, is classified by
the aerodynamic diameter of particles: PM10 is
< 10 μm in diameter; PM2.5 is < 2.5 μm; PM0.1
particles are < 0.1 μm. PM can easily penetrate


the respiratory system and enter the blood,
causing extensive inflammatory reactions, endothelial cell damage, increased oxidative
stress, and ultimately carcinogenesis [4-6].

Ambient PM has been designated as a Group 1
human carcinogen by the International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2013 [7]. In a
meta-analysis originated by the IARC, the rela­
tive risk for lung cancer associated with PM2.5
and PM10 was 1.09 (95% confidential interval

[CI]: 1.04, 1.14), and 1.08 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.17),
respectively [8]. In addition, a growing body of
evidence has demonstrated that increased
PM exposure is positively associated with the
increased incidence and mortality of many
human malignancies including breast cancer

[9, 10], colorectal cancer [11], thyroid cancer

[12], liver cancer [13], and childhood cancer

[14]. Although there is sufficient evidence regarding the association between PM exposure
and human malignancies, evidence for urologic
cancer is limited [15]. Thus, in this nationwide
longitudinal cohort study, we aimed to evaluate
the association between PM10 exposure and
the relative risks of urologic cancers such as
kidney cancer, prostate cancer, and urothelial
cell carcinoma.

Methods

_Data source_

We used a customized database (DB) from the
National Health Information (NHI) DB of the
National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), whi

ch covers nearly the entire
South Korean population. The
NHIS maintains a health examination database for all
insured persons in South
Korea consisting of anthropo­
metric measurements, laboratory tests, and self-report
questionnaires. The NHI DB
includes qualification informa­
tion, insurance rates, health
check-up results, treatment
details, long-term care insur­
ance data for the elderly, treat­
ment status, cancer, and rare
disease registration informa­
tion. The NHIS has provided
data including a sample cohort DB, customized DB, health disease index for academic
research in the health and
medical sector.

_Study population_

This study received exemption
status from the Institutional
Review Board at Seoul St.
Mary’s Hospital and Dankook
University. Participants who
underwent a baseline health
examination in 2008 were
included in the NHI DB (N=
10,581,265). We excluded
participants with any cancer
within the first year from the
index data (N=20,961), those
with no data regarding air pol­

lution between 2005 and 2007 (N=2,010,736),
those who did not receive more than four con­
secutive health examinations from 2010 to
2018 (N=6,226,437), and those with missing
data on health examination (N=2,058,371). A
total of 231,997 participants were included in
the final analysis (Figure 1). The primary end­
point was newly diagnosed urologic cancer
(N=50,677). Figure 2 is a diagram to help
understand the participant timeline.

_Definition of urologic cancer_

We focused on newly diagnosed urologic can­
cers, such as kidney cancer, prostate cancer,
and urothelial cell carcinoma. Kidney cancer
was defined as C64x according to ICD-10

codes. Prostate cancer was defined as C61 and
urothelial cell carcinoma was defined as C65x,
C66x, and C67 according to ICD-10 codes.
Among the newly diagnosed urologic cancer
cases (N=50,677), 9,736 were kidney cancer (19.2%), 28,440 were prostate cancers
(56.1%), and 12,501 were urothelial cell carci­
noma (24.6%).

_Estimation of individual particulate matter ex­_
_posure_

We used air pollution data from AirKorea pro­
vided by the Korean Environment Corporation which collects local pollution information
through the National Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Information System and provides it
through the AirKorea website [16]. In South
Korea, PM10 standard was newly established
and has been applied since 1995. In 2008,
426 measuring stations were installed nation­
wide (as of the end of December 2008) [17].

_Covariate assessment_

Regular physical activity was divided into three
groups: no exercise, 1-4 times per week, and ≥
5 days per week. Alcohol consumption was
divided into three groups: non-drinkers, drink­
ers (2-8 times per month), and heavy drinkers
(≥ 4 times per week). There were three groups
of smokers: non-smokers, ex-smokers, and
smokers. Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperten­
sion were classified according to the presence
or absence of disease using the ICD-10 codes.
There were three groups of body mass index
(BMI): below 25 (underweight and normal),
25-29.9 (overweight), and over 30 kg/m[2] (obe­
sity) [18]. There were three groups of fasting
blood glucose levels: normal, pre-diabetic, and
diabetic [19]. There were four groups of total
cholesterol: desirable level (< 200 mg/dL), bor­
derline high level (200-239 mg/dL), and high
level (≥ 240 mg/dL) [20].


_Statistical analysis_

Statistical analyses were performed using R
version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10) and SPSS Statistics version 25.0 (SPSS Inc.). R was used for
data preprocessing and visualization of the
PM10 data distribution. The baseline demographic data of the participants were compared
using the independent t-test for continuous
variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. The incidence rates of uro­
logic cancer were calculated per 1,000 personyears. The association between the incidence
of urologic cancer and PM10 exposure was
assessed using multivariate Cox proportional
hazards regression analysis. All statistical tests
were two-tailed, and the significance level was
set at P-values < 0.05.

Results

_Baseline statistics of air pollutant_

We used 3-year average PM10 concentration
data measured at 398 stations from 2005 to
2007 (based on 2008). To categorize the par­
ticipants according to PM10 concentration, we
explored the PM10 concentration data. The
mean and median PM10 concentration were
56.24 and 56 μg/m[3], respectively. The skew­
ness and kurtosis were 0.133 and 0.139,
respectively (Figure 3). There are four criteria
for PM10 concentrations in South Korea: good
(0-30 μg/m[3]), moderate (31-80 μg/m[3]), unhealthy (81-150 μg/m[3]), and very unhealthy (>
150 μg/m[3]) [21]. Due to the nature of the data,
it was not possible to classify the participants
according to the Korean criteria for PM10 con­
centration. Considering the characteristics of
the data regarding PM10 concentration, the par­
ticipants were divided into two groups accord­
ing to the median concentration of PM10 (56
μg/m[3]). The location-specific distribution of
urologic cancer incidence and PM10 concentra­

tion in South Korea showed similar patterns as
shown in Figure 4.

_Baseline characteristics of the participants_

Of the total 231,99 participants, 21.8% devel­
oped urologic cancer during the median followup of 6.7 years (Table 1). Of the total 50,677
urologic cancer patients, 56.1% had prostate
cancer, 24.7% had urothelial cell carcinoma,
and 19.2% had kidney cancer. The age ratio of
those aged ≥ 65 years was 49.5%, similar to
that of those aged < 60 years. The proportion
of female was 77.3%. Fifty percent of partici­
pants did not exercise regularly, 56.8% of the
total did not drink alcohol. 60.7% of the total
were non-smokers. Only 28.5% had hyperten­
sion and 12.4% had DM.


We divided the extracted data into two groups
based on PM10 concentration (Table 2). According to the PM10 concentration, there were sig­
nificant differences in almost all baseline char­
acteristics. Regardless of the occurrence of
urological cancer, the proportion of participants
older than 65 years and males was significantly
higher in the high PM10 group. The prevalence
of comorbidities such as DM and hypertension
was also higher in the high PM10 group.

1.068, 1.050-1.087; Model 2: 1.604, 1.0461.083; Model 3: 1.604, 1.046-1.083).


We found similar results for kidney and pros­
tate cancers (P for trend < 0.001). For kidney
cancer, participants in the high PM10 exposure
group had a higher risk than those in the low
PM10 exposure group: over 56 μg/m[3] (Model 1:
1.122, 1,064-1.115; Model 2: 1.113, 1.070

tate cancer, participants in the high PM10 expo­
sure group had a higher risk than those in the
low PM10 exposure group: over 56 μg/m[3] (Model

in urothelial cell carcinoma, there was no sig­
nificant increase in the HRs in the high PM10
exposure group.

_Risk of urologic cancer in clinically relevant_
_subgroup_

We conducted subgroup analysis based on sev­
eral clinically relevant variables (Table 4). We
observed the same trend of increasing risk of
kidney and prostate cancer in participants in
the high PM10 group compared with those in the
low PM10 group. For kidney cancer, participants
with the following characteristics were more
susceptible to these associations: age < 65
years, female sex, decreased regular physical
activity, current smoking, no DM, no hyperten­
sion, normal BMI, and desirable total choles­
terol level. For prostate cancer, participants
with the following characteristics were more
susceptible to these associations: decreased
regular physical activity, current smoking, and
no hypertension.

Discussion

Considering the rapidly urbanizing world, it is
becoming increasingly important to evaluate air
pollution as a determinant of cancer, especially
with respect to the reduction of some tradition­
al risk factors, such as smoking, workplace car­
cinogens, and solid fuel, which may be improved
over time with various smoking control activi­
ties, workplace safety measures, and socioeco­
nomic development. In this respect, there were
several important observations in our study
regarding the association of urologic cancer
and PM10 exposure. We found that high PM10
exposure was associated with an increased
risk of overall urologic cancer, especially kidney
and prostate cancers. We also found that the
increased risk of kidney and prostate cancer
related to high PM10 exposure was significantly
augmented among participants with current
smoking, female sex (only in kidney cancer),
and no features of metabolic disorders, and
decreased among participants with regular
physical activity five or more times per week.


Currently available studies on the association
between the risk of urologic cancer and air
pollution have reported conflicting results.
Fourteen cohorts from the European Study of
Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects study demon­
strated higher HRs for kidney parenchyma can­
cer in association with higher PM2.5 concentrations (HRs 1.57, 95% CI 0.81-3.01, per 5 μg/
m[3] PM2.5), although not statistically significant

[22]. In a population-based study in Shanghai,
China, waste gas emissions were positively
associated with multiple cancers, incidence
including kidney, bladder, and prostate cancer

[23]. In a recent Canadian case-control study,
positive associations were found between
exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 over the previous 20
years and prostate cancer [24]. However, a
Danish cohort study that investigated the asso­
ciation between NO2 and 20 selected cancers
reported an association between NO2 exposure
and increased risk of cervical and brain cancer
but not with bladder, kidney, and prostate can­
cer [25]. Thus, a recent systematic review of 20
studies concluded that most previous studies
reported a positive association between air pol­
lution and bladder or kidney cancer risk, but
only a few reached statistical significance; also
most studies inadequately addressed con­
founding factors, and cohort studies had insuf­
ficient numbers of participants and follow-up
duration [15]. Our study is meaningful in that it
presents positive results using a large number
of participants, after controlling for sufficient
confounding factors.

One of the interesting details of our study is
that the impact of PM10 exposure on subse­
quent kidney and prostate cancer risks was
more prominent in participants with specific
characteristics. First, the association between
PM10 exposure and risk of kidney cancer was
more prominent in females than males. It is not
clear whether females are more susceptible to
cancers associated with air pollution. Similar to
our findings, Li et al. reported that females were
more susceptible to the association between
the risk of esophageal cancer and air pollution
than males [26]. Although it is not a cancer
research, Liu et al. also reported that suscepti­
bility to cardiovascular mortality from air pollu­
tion was higher among females than males

[27]. Further researches on the difference in
urologic cancer susceptibility from air pollution
in males and females is needed.

Second, the association between PM10 expo­
sure and the risk of kidney and prostate can­
cers was more prominent in participants with­
out features of metabolic disorders. The ratio­
nale for these results is unclear. However, it is


necessary to consider that metabolic disorders
such as DM, hypertension, and dyslipidemia
are important risk factors for urologic cancer. A
recent meta-analysis of 151 cohort studies
comprising 32 million participants showed that


-----

DM was associated with an increased risk of
kidney (pooled relative risk [RR] 1.32, 95% CI
1.21-1.44) and bladder (pooled RR 1.19, 95%
CI 1.09-1.29) cancer [28]. Another meta-analy­
sis of 24 studies including a total of 132,589
participants reported an association between
metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer inci­
dence (odds ratio [OR] 1.17, 95% CI 1.00-1.36)
and between metabolic syndrome and highgrade prostate cancer (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.502.38) [29]. Considering the well-known mecha­
nisms linking DM, hypertension, and dyslipid­
emia to cancer [30-32], it can be assumed that
the risk of urologic cancer did not increase as
similar mechanisms of these chronic diseases
and PM10 are complementary.

Finally, the association between PM10 concen­
tration and the risks of both kidney and pros­
tate cancers differed according to the category
of regular physical activity. In participants with
no regular physical activity or regular physical
activity 1-4 times per week, high PM10 exposure
was significantly associated with increased
risks of kidney and prostate cancer. In contrast,
in participants who engaged in regular physical
activity five or more times per week, high PM10
exposure was not associated with an increased
risk of kidney and prostate cancer. Although
regular physical activity is known to reduce the
incidence and mortality from cardiovascular
diseases, type 2 DM, and several cancers [33,
34], there might be some concerns regarding
exposure to air pollution during physical activi­
ty. However, numerous epidemiological and
modeling studies have suggested that the longterm benefits of physical activity in urban areas
outweigh the risks of exposure to air pollution

[35]. The results of our study might provide
additional evidence that regular physical activi­
ty offsets the risks of kidney and prostate can­
cer associated with PM10 exposure.

This study had some limitations. First, we excluded participants who did not undergo more
than four consecutive health examinations
from 2010 to 2018 to avoid the bias of cancer
not being diagnosed, even though it has actu­
ally occurred. However, the risk of another
selection bias may have occurred because a
significant number of participants who did not
receive more than four consecutive health
examinations were excluded. Second, we esti­
mated the level of individual exposure to PM10
by using fixed outdoor measurement stations


near their residential regions. This approach
may ignore the possible differences between
individuals within the same residential region
with regard to occupational exposure, daily
activity area, indoor or outdoor exposure time,
and the use of air purifiers. However, previous
studies have shown that personal PM concen­
trations correlate reasonably well with PM con­
centrations measured at fixed outdoor measur­
ing stations [36]. Finally, in 2008, the level of
air pollution in South Korea was less severe
than it is now, and the distribution or number of
measurements of air pollutants was not as
large as it is now. Therefore, this should be con­
sidered when interpreting our results. However,
the major strength of our study was its large
sample size, which allowed us to comprehen­
sively control for important confounding factors.

Conclusions

High PM10 exposure is associated with an
increased risk of overall urologic cancer, espe­
cially kidney and prostate cancers. Additionally,
the increased risk of kidney and prostate can­
cer related to high PM10 exposure is significant­
ly increased by current smoking, female sex
(only in kidney cancer), and no features of met­
abolic disorders, and is decreased with regular physical activity five or more times a week.
Although further studies are needed, physi­
cians should consider more attentive lifestyle
interventions, including air quality improvement
and encouraging regular physical activity, to
decrease the risk of urological cancers.
