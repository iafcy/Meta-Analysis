1. Introduction


#### a b s t r a c t

Background and aims: A landfill, an incinerator, and a refinery plant have been operating since the early
1960s in a contaminated site located in the suburb of Rome (Italy). To evaluate their potential health
effects, a population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using dispersion modeling for
exposure assessment.
Methods: A fixed cohort was enrolled in the Rome Longitudinal Study in 2001, mortality and hospitalizations were followed-up until 2010. Exposure assessments to the landfill (H2S), the incinerator (PM10),
and the refinery plant (SOX) were performed for each subject using a Lagrangian dispersion model. Individual and small-area variables were available (including exposures levels to NO2 from traffic and
diesel trucks). Cox regression analysis was performed (hazard ratios, HRs, 95% CI) using linear terms for
the exposures (5th–95th percentiles difference). Single and bi-pollutant models were run.
Results: The cohort included 85,559 individuals. The estimated annual average exposures levels were
correlated. H2S from the landfill was associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both genders
(HR 1.04 95% CI 1.00–1.09 in women); PM10 from the incinerator was associated with pancreatic cancer
mortality in both genders (HR 1.40 95% CI 1.03–1.90 in men, HR 1.47 95% CI 1.12–1.93 in women) and with
breast morbidity in women (HR 1.13 95% CI 1.00–1.27). SOx from the refinery was associated with laryngeal cancer mortality in women (HR 4.99 95% CI 1.64–15.9) and respiratory hospital admissions (HR
1.13 95% CI 1.01–1.27).
Conclusions: We found an association of the pollution sources with some cancer forms and cardio-respiratory diseases. Although there was a high correlation between the estimated exposures, an indication
of specific effects from the different sources emerged.

In the Malagrotta area, located in the suburb of Rome (Italy), a
large landfill for municipal solid waste (MSW), an incinerator of
medical wastes, and a petrochemical refinery are situated within
just a few kilometers of each other. Limited evidence of increased
risk of cancer has been suggested among people living close to
incinerators (Porta et al., 2009; Forastiere et al., 2011; WHO, 2007)
and several uncertainties limit the interpretation of the available
epidemiological studies on landfills (Porta et al., 2009). There is no
clear indication that living close to a refinery is associated with
cancer incidence or cause-specific mortality (Simonsen et al.,
2010). An old study suggested an increase in lung cancer mortality

among women living close to major industries (Bhopal et al.,
1998), while a more recent study (Cirera et al., 2013) has documented an association with haematological cancers.
Most of the studies conducted in contaminated sites have
methodological problems, including the use of health data at the
aggregate level, the limited possibility of adjusting for socioeconomic status, (Floret et al., 2003; Viel et al., 2008) or the distance from the source used as a proxy for population exposure. In
2011, the European Environmental Agency (EEA) suggested applying dispersion models to provide a better exposure assessment
(European Environmental Agency, 2014). Recently, an assessment
of air pollution exposure from incinerator emissions was performed in the UK and a review on exposure assessment methods
in epidemiological studies of incinerators was published (Ashworth et al., 2013; Cordioli et al., 2013).


-----

Previous studies conducted in the Malagrotta area detected an
excess of stomach cancer among workers at the medical waste
incinerator and an increase of lung, bladder, brain cancers and
multiple myeloma among petroleum refinery workers (Rapiti
et al., 1997; Lo Presti et al., 2001). A study on the resident population did not indicate an excess mortality in people living close to
the landfill, except for laryngeal cancer among men (Michelozzi
et al., 1998).

This study aimed at evaluating the morbidity and mortality
effects of exposures to the three sources of air pollution (landfill,
incinerator, and refinery plant) in the cohort of people living in the
Malagrotta area. Dispersion models were used for exposure assessment considering urban traffic and individual factors (e.g.
educational level, occupation, area-based socioeconomic status) as
potentially confounding variables.

2. Methods

2.1. The study plants and the area of investigation

The landfill, one of the largest in Europe (15 ha of surface,
1.46 million t MSW/year), began officially in 1984 receiving unprocessed municipal waste; however, the unofficial use of the
landfill dates back at least 10–15 years. The closure of the landfill
was announced in 2004 but actually occurred at the end of 2013,
after Italy received a notice from the EU Commission for infringement of the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC). The incinerator
for medical waste (stack height 80 m, stack diameter 1.13 m, exit
velocity 15.5 m/s, capacity 60 t/day) began its activity in 1996,
replacing the old MSW incinerator that had burnt waste from 1964
to 1985 and then closed because of failure to comply with pollution standards as no emissions control measures were operating.
The petrochemical refinery (97 ha of surface, 15 stacks ranging
from 25 to 72 m in height, stacks diameter ranging from 0.8 to
2.9 m, exit velocity ranging from 1 to 5.9 m/s) has been refining
4.3 million t/year of crude oil since 1964 and is the most important
refinery plant in central Italy.
The study area was defined as a 7 km radius from the boundary
of the landfill defined using GIS software to allow a proper comparison among subjects with a wide range of contrasting exposure
values The petrochemical refinery and the waste incinerator were
located by their chimneys coordinates. The World Geodetic System
of 1984, with the Universal Transverse Mercator zone 33Nord
projection (WGS84_UTM33N) was the reference for the geographical coordinates.

2.2. Exposure assessment

We used a Lagrangian particle model (SPRAY ver.5) to simulate
the concentration of air pollutants (ARIANET, 2014). The SPRAY
model simulates the transport, dispersion and deposition of pollutants emitted (2005 emission inventories) using the orography,
the meteorological data (managed by RAMS 2005 (RAMS, 2014)),
the turbulence and the hourly spatial distribution (horizontal and
vertical) of the emissions, based on the characteristics of the single
source and on the mass fluxes (g/h). The model follows the path of
fictitious particles in the atmospheric turbulent flow, and it is able
to take into account complex situations, such as the presence of
obstacles, breeze cycles, strong meteorological non homogeneities
and non-stationary, wind calm conditions.
The domain for estimating pollutants concentrations was a
square of 30 � 30 km[2] and the resolution chosen was 500 m
(consistent with the meteorological fields). A single concentration
value was estimated as the annual average for a square cell of
500 m � 500 m For each source a pollutant was selected as the


exposure marker: hydrogen sulphide (H2S) for the landfill, sulphur
oxides (SOX) for the petrochemical refinery, and airborne particulate matter of diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) for the
incinerator.
The landfill emissions (H2S) were generated using Landfill Gas
Emissions Model (Landfill Gas Emissions Model, 2014). Using the
dates of starting and ending of the operation for each sector of the
landfill, the waste capacity and the waste acceptance rate, the
emission rates for H2S were calculated using a first-order decomposition rate equation. The Emission Manager software EMMA
was used to approximate the landfill shape as a regular grid with a
resolution of 125 m � 125 m and to estimate the hourly emissions
of the H2S emission in each landfill allotment (Calori and Radice,
2004).

We obtained the hourly emission values of SOX (refinery) and
PM10 (incinerator) assuming uniform time modulation and using
information about the chimney geographic coordinates, its internal diameter, the percentage of release of gases, the temperature
and speed of the flue gas. Estimated annual average concentration
maps of current H2S, SOX, and PM10 levels were produced. Although it can be assumed that significant changes occurred in
relation to the activity in the area and the specific emissions, i.e.
increasing and decreasing of the landfill activity, change in the
activity of the incinerator, emission control from the refinery, no
emission data from the past were available so to consider timechanges in the exposure variables in the analysis. Therefore, no
attempt was made to back extrapolate concentration levels.

2.3. Enrollment of the cohort and follow-up procedures

The Rome Longitudinal Study (RoLS) (a population-based cohort enrolled from the 2001 Italian census) was the source for the
study cohort (Cesaroni et al., 2010). The RoLS is part of the National
Statistical Program for the years 2011–2014 and was approved by
the Italian Data Protection Authority. All residents, living in the
study area at the same baseline address for at least 5 years before
October 2001, and who did not move during the course of the
follow-up, were enrolled. Vital status was assessed using the Rome
municipal register during the period October 2001 to December
2010. We considered subjects as lost to follow-up if they died or
moved out of the city. Each subject in the cohort was assigned a
value of H2S, SOX, and PM10 corresponding to the estimated map
values at their residence.

2.4. Health outcomes

We analyzed natural and cause-specific mortality and hospital
admissions. We considered cancer types for which there were
some possible hypotheses of an association with environmental
factors: stomach, colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung,
bladder, kidney, brain, and lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer
(see appendix for ICD IX codes) (Porta et al., 2009; Bhopal et al.,
1998; Michelozzi et al., 1998; Ranzi et al., 2011; Rushton 2003;
Elliott et al., 1996; Bhopal et al., 2009). The underlying cause of
death for deceased subjects was retrieved from the regional Registry of Causes of Death, while hospital admissions were obtained
from the regional Hospital Information System. For each subject
only the principal diagnoses cause of hospitalization were used
and the event was defined at the time of the first hospitalization
for a specific cause that occurred in the study period.

2.5. Covariates

We considered for each subject age, gender, region of birth
(north, center, south, out of Italy) educational level (high: university medium: high school and low: elementary school)


-----

occupation (non manual labor, manual labor, retired, unemployed,
housewife), civil status (married, single, separated/divorced, widowed), and an area-basedsocio-economic position (SEP) index
(high, medium, low) (Cesaroni et al., 2006).
Outdoor concentrations of NO2 (μg/m[3]) at the residential addresses of the cohort participants were available from a Land Use
Regression (LUR) model built for the city of Rome (Cesaroni et al.,
2012). We categorized the NO2 estimated concentration of μg/m[3]

in three levels: low (NO2o ¼30), medium (30 oNO2o ¼40) and
high (NO2440). We also considered NO2 (in μg/m[3]) related to the
municipal solid waste transport system (diesel trucks) from the
city of Rome to the landfill in 2008 (low: NO2o ¼ 0.101, medium:
0.101 oNO2o ¼0.856, and high: NO240.856) (further details
in [http://www.integrated-assessment.eu/content/health_effects_](http://www.integrated-assessment.eu/content/health_effects_waste_management)
[waste_management).](http://www.integrated-assessment.eu/content/health_effects_waste_management)
As an alternative surrogate of long term exposure to air pollution at the baseline address, we used the Functional Road Class
(FRC) attribute (included in the TeleAtlas MultiNet road network)
to classify the type of street: motorway (FRC ¼0) and major traffic
roads (FRC¼1–5).

2.6. Statistical analyzes

We investigated the correlation between exposure to H2S, SOX,
and PM10 using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. We used genderspecific Cox proportional hazard regression models [hazard ratios
(HRs)] to study the association between air pollution exposures
and the study outcomes, with age as the underlying time variable.
To take into account possible time-related changes in mortality
and hospitalization rates during the study period, the analyzes
were performed stratifying by calendar period (2001–2004; 2005–
2007; 2008–2010).
Exposure to the different pollution sources was modeled (single-pollutant models) as a fixed continuous variable using the
value of the annual mean exposure at the residence. Because of the
varying magnitude of the exposure indicator, the linear associations were estimated for an increment equal to the difference
between the 95th and the 5th percentiles of the distribution of
each pollutant. HRs were estimated considering as confounders all
the individual covariates, the GIS variables, and the other environmental factors. More parsimonious models were built using a
backward elimination strategy for variables with a p-value4 0.20
(this was done for major outcomes like non-accidental mortality).
The final models included the following variables: education, occupation, civil status, area-based SEP index, and the outdoor NO2
concentration (from the LUR model). In order to disentangle the
role of each pollutant/source of emission, single and multipollutant (bi-pollutant) models were performed. We considered as
candidate for the multipollutant analyzes all the possible positive
associations between the pollutants and the outcomes that had
more stable effect estimates.
The potential spatial autocorrelation of health outcomes was
taken into account because people that are geographically close
are more similar to each other than to people who live far away
and therefore tend to experience more similar outcome rates. In
order to adjust for this phenomenon, each address was classified
according to a 500 m � 500 m grid, and the Cox regression model
was extended by including a random intercept of the grid cells.
Although we always considered spatial autocorrelation in our
analysis, the only condition where this correlation was statistically
significant was for non accidental mortality among men (p-value
of the random intercepto 0.015).
All tests were based on the likelihood ratio test statistic. Twosided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated on the basis of
the Wald test of the Cox regression parameter on the log ratio
scale STATA and R softwares were used for the statistical analyzes


3. Results

Fig. 1 illustrates the study area (a) and results of the dispersion
model for H2S originating from the landfill (b), SOX, from refinery
(c), and PM10 from the incinerator (d). The dispersion model for
H2S shows the highest concentration of the pollutant on the
landfill itself with a regular dispersion in the surrounding area.
The dispersion of SOX originated from multiple point sources at
the refinery plant (with heights ranging from 25 m-responsible for
a more local dispersion-to 72 m with wider dispersion) had overall
a larger impact in the area. The dispersion of PM10 from the incinerator was mainly influenced by chimney height (80 m) and
prevailing winds (SW-NE direction). The results were a relatively
wide dispersion of particles in the area in two directions, one on
the southwest and one on the northeast of the chimney.
A total of 85,559 individuals were enrolled in the cohort in
2001 (48.2% males), and the concentrations of the pollutants
were estimated for each of them at their residential address at
baseline. Online supplementary Fig. S1 shows the population
distribution of exposure levels for H2S, SOX, and PM10. The annual
average exposure levels of the population [mean (SD, 50th percentile, 95th–5th percentiles )] were generally low: 0.02 μg/m[3]

(0.03, 0.01, 0.04) for H2S (landfill), 1.67 μg/m[3] (0.92, 1.52, 2.88) for
SOX (petrochemical refinery), and 0.02 ng/m[3] (0.02, 0.02, 0.04) for
PM10 (incinerator). The three exposure indicators were highly
correlated: the correlation coefficient between H2S and SOX was
0.78, between H2S and PM10 was 0.75, and between SOX and PM10
was 0.81. The cut-offs for the upper 90th percentile were
0.03 ng/m[3] for H2S, 2.52 μg/m[3] for SOX, and 0.03 mg/m[3] for PM10.
(Table S1)
In addition to the pollution produced by the industrial plants,
air quality in the area was greatly affected by traffic as it is located
close to important roads: the Ring Road of Rome, two highways
(one leading to the airport), and a local road network mainly devoted to MSW transport to the landfill. Online supplementary Fig.
S2 shows the location of the highways, the high traffic roads, and
estimated NO2 concentration levels from road traffic, and from
waste transport.
The main characteristics of the 85,559 subjects according to
three exposure sources (divided by 50th and 90th percentile cutoffs) are described in Table 1.
The distribution of gender, age classes, birth place, and civil
status was rather similar over the exposure categories for all pollutants. However, people living in areas with high concentrations
of H2S, SOX, or PM10 were more likely to be less educated, to be
manual workers, and of low SEP compared with their reference
groups (po0.05). In addition, people in the high exposure categories tended to live closer (500 m) to highways, but more distant
from the high traffic roads; therefore, traffic-related NO2 concentrations were lower in these groups compared with those in
the low exposure category (po0.05). No differences between the
cohort and the general population living in Rome was observed for
gender, age, level of education, civil status, and occupation. The
main difference between Roman citizens and residents in this area
is that in this cohort 62% of people lived in low and medium-low
SEP areas compared to 41.1% observed in Rome, in addition the
mean NO2 level in Rome was 43.6 μg/m[3] (SD 8.4) whereas the
mean level in this area was lower, i.e. 37.8 μg/m[3] (SD 5.02).
During the study period (October 2001–December 2010) we
observed 6187 deaths and, after excluding trauma, we considered
5878 (3233 men and 2645 women) deaths from non accidental
causes (38.8% from cancer, 38.1% from cardiovascular diseases, and
6.5% from respiratory diseases); 45514 subjects were admitted to
the hospital (13.2% for cancer, 25.2% for cardiovascular diseases,
and 12 6% for respiratory diseases)

Fig. 1. Study area (panel a) and results of the dispersion models for H2S (panel b), SOX (panel c) and PM10 (panel d).


We found an association between the linear term of H2S exposure and laryngeal cancer (HR ¼1.36; 95% CI 1.02–1.83, based on
6 cases) as well as bladder cancer (HR ¼1.35; 95% CI 1.00–1.82) in
women. Mortality for pancreatic and laryngeal cancer was associated with SOX from the refinery, again only among women
(HR¼ 1.75, 95% CI 1.02–3.01 and HR¼ 4.99, 95% CI 1.64–15.2, respectively). A clear association between PM10 and pancreatic
cancer was observed in both genders (HR ¼1.40; 95% CI 1.03–1.90
men; HR¼ 1.47; 95% CI 1.12–1.93 women). PM10 was also associated with laryngeal cancer among women (HR¼ 1.92; 95% CI
1.16−3.19) (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the results for hospital admissions. There was an
association of H2S exposure and hospitalizations for laryngeal
cancer (HR ¼1.36; 95% CI 1.08–1.72, based on 9 cases with a clear
overlap with mortality) only among women, and for cardiovascular diseases in both genders (HR¼1.02; 95% CI 0.98–1.05 in men
and HR¼1.04; 95% CI 1.00–1.09 women). H2S exposure was also
associated with hospital admissions for respiratory diseases
among men (HR¼ 1.02 95% CI 0.97–1.07). SOX from the refinery
was associated with hospital admissions for laryngeal cancer
among women (HR¼4.19; 95% CI 1.36–12.9) and for respiratory
diseases among men (HR ¼1.13; 95% CI 1.01–1.27). There was an
association between the linear term of PM10 exposure and for
pancreatic cancer hospitalizations (HR ¼1.35; 95% CI 1.01–1.81)
among men. PM10 was also associated with hospitalizations for
liver (HR ¼ 1.55; 95%1.02–2.35), laryngeal (HR ¼ 1.83; 95%1.09–
3.06), and breast cancers (HR ¼ 1.13; 95%1.00–1.27) among women. PM10 exposure was also associated with hospital admission
for respiratory diseases among men (HR ¼1.05 95% CI 0.99–1.12).
It should be noted that there were few inverse associations
among women namely for SOx and PM10 and hospitalizations for


cancer of the lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue and for PM10
and hospitalizations for genitourinary diseases.
Since only some confounders were used in our main models
(education, occupation, civil status, area-based SEP index, and
outdoor NO2 concentrations from the LUR model), we repeated the
analyzes considering all sets of confounding variables and the
results were very similar.
Supplemental Tables S2 and S3 report the results of the multipollutant models. In interpreting these results the high correlation among the pollutants should be noted, making some of the
effect estimates unstable. For pancreatic cancer mortality, the
strongest and most stable associations were found for PM10 in
both gender and the adjustment for SOX or H2S did not alter the
main results. The limited number of laryngeal cancer cases precluded meaningful multivariate analyzes, however the strong association for SOx in females remained after multiple adjustment.
The association of H2S with bladder cancer in females was sensitive to the adjustment for the other variables. For hospitalizations,
PM10 was associated with liver cancer but the confidence intervals
were wider after adjustment whereas only limited changes were
seen for PM10 and pancreatic cancer in males or breast cancer in
females. The associations of H2S with cardiovascular morbidity in
both males and females, as well as the association of SOx with
respiratory diseases hospitalization in males, were not changed
after adjustment for other pollutants. In summary, PM10 (incinerator) was the strongest factor for pancreatic mortality and
hospital admissions and for breast cancer morbidity; SOx (refinery)
was the strongest factor for laryngeal cancer mortality in women
and for respiratory hospital admissions in males; H2S (landfill) was
associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both
genders

4. Discussion

Overall and all cancer mortality were not associated with the
exposure indicators. However, we found a positive association between the emissions from the incinerator and pancreatic cancer
mortality in both genders and, among women, an association with
breast cancer morbidity. Emissions from the refinery were associated with laryngeal cancer mortality in women and with respiratory hospital admissions in males; H2S from the landfill was
associated with cardiovascular hospital admissions in both genders.
Our results for cancers are difficult to be interpreted in etiological terms and a review of previous knowledge is useful. Laryngeal cancer has risk factors such as cigarette smoking, occupational exposure to certain substances (eg asbestos), and alcohol
consumption. An association of contaminated sites with laryngeal

cancer has already been observed in two studies conducted in the
1990s, one conducted in the Malagrotta area (Michelozzi et al.,
1998; Elliott et al., 1992). Two recent studies found associations
between living close to incinerators and laryngeal cancer while a
Canadian study did not detect any association (Ranzi et al., 2011;
Federico et al., 2010; Williams and Jalaludin 1998). It is to note that
the excess laryngeal cancer that we found among women was
based on few cases (six of the nine cases hospitalized for larynx
cancer were also observed deaths). A large ecological study, carried out in the UK, analyzed the incidence of bladder cancer in
populations living at various distances from a landfill site and did
not detect any association (Jarup et al., 2002). However, bladder
cancer has been associated with residence in a polluted city area in
a case-control study of the general population in Spain (CastañoVinyals et al., 2008). Pancreatic cancer was the site in excess in

both men and women in our study. The etiologic factors of pancreatic cancer include smoking and alcohol abuse and the literature does not support a potential effect of environmental chemicals (Schottenfeld and Fraumeni, 2006). A Finnish study found a
strong excess of pancreatic cancer among men living in a former
dump area, but the authors concluded that the observed excess
was more likely explained by clustering of males with diabetes and
pancreatitis-related behavior (Pukkala and Pönkä, 2001). However,


a report of cancer incidence among persons living near a waste
landfill site in Montreal, Canada, found increased incidence of
cancers of the liver, kidney, pancreas, and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (Goldberg et al., 1999).
Among women residents in this area we also observed an increase in the risk of hospital admissions for breast cancer, particularly for those exposed to high concentrations of PM10 (incinerator). These results confirm those recently found among

women living near the incinerator in Coriano (North of Italy) and
are in line with other results previously published (WHO 2007;
Ranzi et al., 2011).
The increased risk for cardio-respiratory diseases, observed
particularly among residents exposed to emissions from the incinerator and the refinery, can be considered a plausible effect of
air pollution typical of industrial areas. There is a body of scientific
evidence to substantiate the findings with regard to cardio-respiratory effects of air pollution (Forastiere et al., 2011; WHO
2005; Brook et al., 2010).
From the results of this study it is not easy to determine which
specific agent emitted from the plants could have an etiological
role in the excess risks found. PM10 and SOX have been already
used as surrogate markers for exposure to a complex mixture of
the pollutants produced by combustion processes: particles, gases,
metals, and organic compounds (Ranzi et al., 2011; Smargiassi
et al., 2009). Gases emitted from landfills consist of methane and
carbon dioxide, and other gases, such as hydrogen sulphide and a
mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted at low
concentrations that comprises approximately 0.5% of the total
emissions. We chose H2S as the landfill tracer because MSW
landfills are potential sources of offensive odors that disturb
nearby communities and this emission can be well characterized
(Palmiotto et al., 2014; Sarkar et al., 2003). Overall, the estimated
concentrations of PM10, SOX and H2S were low and highly correlated (correlation 0.75–0.81) which make it more difficult to
identify emissions (and consequently the plants) most responsible
for the observed effects.
The strength of this work is the cohort size (85,559 residents)
and the longitudinal study design adopted: individuals were followed for over ten years, exposure was assessed with advanced
modeling techniques, and individual SEP, urban and waste truck
traffic were also considered as potential confounders. We defined
the study population as people living up to 7 km away from the
plants, based on previous studies and on the estimated profile of
the distribution of pollutants emitted (Elliott et al., 1992). This
choice provided a good contrast of exposure conditions and increased the comparability of the population groups.
Pollutant levels estimated at residence may not adequately
represent exposure because people do not spend all their time at
home, and we did not provide any information regarding daily or
occupational activities. However, the excesses we detected in the
areas with higher exposure levels were observed mainly among
women, a more stable population then men, suggesting that
misclassification of exposure is less likely to have occurred. The
inaccuracy of individual exposure would lead to non-differential
misclassification and would tend to mask the detected association,
leading to results biased towards the null, but we cannot exclude a
chance finding given the multiple testing we performed.
We could not take into account individual risk factors such as
cigarette smoking, alcohol use and physical activity, however
those individual characteristics are strongly associated with SEP. It
is therefore reasonable to assume that the adjustment we made in
the statistical analysis for education, occupation, and area-based

Appendix

SEP also adjusted for those unmeasured individual variables.
However, we found no excess risk of lung, stomach or colon and
rectum cancers. We noticed few inverse associations (cancer of the
lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue and genitourinary diseases)
for which we do not have an explanation other than chance.
We took into account the effect of exposure to vehicular traffic
using predicted NO2 levels; the dispersion model for NO2 showed
no overlap between the areas of high NO2 and the areas of high
PM10, SOX, or H2S concentrations. The associations observed in the
present study, if causal, represent the effects of long-term exposures to a pollutant mixture even after statistical control for the
background pollutant levels. Indeed, the SOX exposure estimates
used in this study are likely correlated with other stack and/or
fugitive refinery emissions such as PM2.5 and volatile organic
compounds.
We studied a closed population and therefore, immigrants, and
all children born after October 2001 were not included. For this
reason, it was not possible to assess the health of children residents. However, the analysis carried out on 2815 children present to October 2001 revealed no special increases in the risk of
mortality or hospital admission related to the estimated concentration of the pollutant tracers of the plants (data not shown).
Monitoring campaigns conducted during the study period
shows that SOX, PM10, and NO2 concentrations in the Malagrotta
area were below the limits established by law, and the H2S measured concentrations were also below the reference value of
150 μg/m[3] set by the WHO guidelines for air quality (WHO, 2005;
ISPRA, 2011). In this study we used authorized emission values to
simulate dispersion from the industrial plants, which overestimated concentration values; nevertheless the shape of the
fallout and the gradients of exposure were not sensitive to this
choice. It should be noted that we considered only exposure to air
pollution whereas soil contamination or food and water consumption could have importance but detailed data on these aspects were lacking.
In conclusion, the study suggests an association between air
contamination and some cancers and cardio-respiratory diseases.
Although there was a high correlation between pollutants estimates, some specific effects from the single sources emerged.
