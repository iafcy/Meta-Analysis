BACKGROUND: Previous research has identified an association between fine particulate matter (PM2:5) air pollution and lung cancer. Most of the evidence for this association, however, is based on research using lung cancer mortality, not incidence. Research that examines potential associations
between PM2:5 and incidence of non-lung cancers is limited.
OBJECTIVES: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between the incidence of cancer and exposure to PM2:5 using
>8:5 million cases of cancer incidences from U.S. registries. Secondary objectives include evaluating the sensitivity of the associations to model
selection, spatial control, and latency period as well as estimating the exposure–response relationship for several cancer types.
METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data were used to calculate incidence rates for various cancer types in 607
U.S. counties. County-level PM2:5 concentrations were estimated using integrated empirical geographic regression models. Flexible seminonparametric regression models were used to estimate associations between PM2:5 and cancer incidence for selected cancers while controlling for
important county-level covariates. Primary time-independent models using average incidence rates from 1992–2016 and average PM2:5 from 1988–
2015 were estimated. In addition, time-varying models using annual incidence rates from 2002–2011 and lagged moving averages of annual estimates
for PM2:5 were also estimated.
RESULTS: The incidences of all cancer and lung cancer were consistently associated with PM2:5. The incident rate ratios (IRRs), per 10-lg=m[3]
increase in PM2:5, for all and lung cancer were 1.09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.14) and 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.30), respectively. Less robust associations were
observed with oral, rectal, liver, skin, breast, and kidney cancers.
DISCUSSION: Exposure to PM2:5 air pollution contributes to lung cancer incidence and is potentially associated with non-lung cancer incidence.

### Introduction
Toxicology research indicates that the carcinogenic compounds
contained in fine particulate matter (PM2:5; particles <2:5 lm in
aerodynamic diameter) contribute to chronic systemic inflammation (Loomis et al. 2013), oxidative stress (Risom et al. 2005),
and DNA damage (Newby et al. 2015) in the lungs. Furthermore,
extensive epidemiological evidence indicates that PM2:5 is associated with lung cancer mortality (Crouse et al. 2015; Yin et al.
2017; Lepeule et al. 2012; Turner et al. 2011; Pope et al. 2019).
For example, a recent meta-analysis estimated the hazard ratio
(HR) for the association between PM2:5 and lung cancer to be
1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.21] (Pope et al.
2020). Much of the epidemiological evidence to support this
association, however, is based on prospective cohort studies that
examined lung cancer mortality, not lung cancer incidence.
Although several recent studies have used incidence data to estimate the association between PM2:5 and lung cancer (IARC
2013; Bai et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020), further research is

needed to confirm the association and examine the sensitivity of
the results to modeling choices and exposure windows.
In addition to lung cancer, several cohort studies have found limited evidence of an association between mortality and incidence of
various non-lung cancers and air pollution (Coleman et al. 2020;
Turner et al. 2017; Wong et al. 2016; Ancona et al. 2015; RaaschouNielsen et al. 2011). However, these studies were inconsistent in their
findings and often limited by small sample size. Furthermore, the use
of mortality follow-up is insufficient to address the effect of air pollution on burden of disease for cancer because of the difficulty in
addressing the problem of latency, accurately analyzing cancers that
are highly survivable, and the possible confounding from mortality of
other causes. Further evidence using cancer incidence data instead of
mortality contributes to evaluating whether non-lung cancer sites are
associated with exposure to PM2:5.
The primary purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
association between the incidence of cancer and exposure to
PM2:5, using available cancer incidence data from U.S. cancer
registries. Secondary objectives included evaluating the sensitivity
of the associations to various lag structures and exposure windows,
exploring the sensitivity of results to modeling assumptions, and
evaluating potential nonlinearities in the exposure–response relationship for various types of cancers.

### Methods

Cancer Incidence Data

The U.S. National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program contains all cancer
cases across cancer registries that cover approximately 34.6% of the
United States (NCI 2019b). The SEER program contains individuallevel cancer incidence from 1975–2016 collected from cancer registries located in California, Connecticut, Detroit, Georgia, Iowa,
Kentucky, Louisiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Seattle (Puget
Sound), and Utah (NCI 2019b). A detailed description of the location

but require a signed SEER research data use agreement (NCI 2019a).
County-level incidence rates were calculated from the SEER
program’s cancer case data to estimate the association between
PM2:5 and cancer incidence. First, cancer cases were totaled for
every county-year and grouped by the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth
Revision (ICD-10; WHO 2016) codes as follows: oral and oropharyngeal (defined by ICD-10 Codes C00–C14), esophageal
(C15), stomach (C16), small intestine (C17), colon (C18), rectal
(C19–C21), liver and biliary tract (C22–C24), pancreatic (C25),
nose (C30–C31), laryngeal and trachea (C32–C33), lung and
bronchus (C34), bone (C40–C41), skin (C43–C44), connective
and soft tissue (C45–C49), breast (C50), cervical (C53), uterine
(C54–C55), ovarian (C56), prostate (C61), other male (C60,
C62–C63), kidney (C64–C65), bladder (C67), brain (C71), endocrine (C73–C75), and ill-defined cancers (C76–C80). Next,
yearly cancer incidence rates per 100,000 for each county were
calculated by dividing by yearly population data (provided by the
SEER program via the U.S. Census) and multiplying by 100,000
for every cancer type (NCI 2019d).
For the primary analysis, the yearly cancer incidence rates were
averaged for each county from 1992–2016 to allow for harmonizing several key variables and for use in a time-independent model.
Average incidence rates from 2008–2016 were also calculated for
use in a latency sensitivity analysis. After removing counties that
were missing PM2:5 estimates or other covariates, 607 counties
remained. In addition to the time-independent analysis, cancer
incidence data was also used to generate annual-average incidence
rates at the county-year level in the 607 counties contained in the
SEER program data for a time-varying model. Due to covariate
limitations, only incidence data from 2002–2011 were available.

Air Pollution Exposure

Regulatory monitoring data for PM2:5 was collected nationwide
starting in 1999. These regulatory data, within an integrated empirical geographic regression modeling framework, were used to generate county-level annual-average PM2:5 concentrations for 1999–
2015. Hold-out cross-validation (CV) indicated good model performance (10-fold CV-R[2]: 0.78, 0.90). More details describing this
approach is found elsewhere (Pope et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2020).
All annual estimates for PM2:5 are available at the Center for Air,
[Climate, and Energy Solutions’ website (https://www.caces.us/).](https://www.caces.us/)
In order to better account for the lagged effect of PM2:5 on cancer
incidence, backcasted PM2:5 estimates for 1988–1998 were also calculated. The estimated PM10 concentration in each county from
1988–1998 was multiplied by the county’s mean PM2:5 to PM10 ratio
from 1999–2003 to generate estimates of the PM2:5 concentration in
each county from 1988–1998 (Pope et al. 2019). The mean PM2:5
concentrations for 1999–2015 and 1988–2015 were highly correlated
(R ≥ 0:97). PM2:5 average exposure from 1999–2015 and from
1988–2015 were linked to average cancer incidence rates from 1992–
2016 by county for use in the primary time-independent model. For
the latency sensitivity analysis average PM2:5 exposures from 1988–
2007 were linked to cancer incidence rates from 2008–2016 to allow
for a lag period. Finally, for the time-varying model, 1-, 5-, 10-, and
15-y lagged moving averages of PM2:5 were estimated and linked to
annual incidence rates in each of the counties.

Additional Covariates

The SEER program provides additional county covariate information collected from the U.S. Census and American Community
Survey, including the following: percentage male; percentage
white, black, Hispanic, and other race/ethnicity; percentage of the


population in each 5-y age group from 0 through 85; educational
attainment (percentage to not graduate high school, percentage to
graduate high school, and percentage to have some college education); median income (adjusted to 2017 U.S. dollars); median
home value and rent; percentage below 150% poverty; percentage
unemployed; percentage working class; and percentage of the population of the county living in rural regions of the county [NCI
2019c, 2019d]. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were
used to obtain additional county-level information including percentage smoking (available from 1996–2012) (Dwyer-Lindgren
et al. 2014), percentage alcohol consumption (available from
2002–2012) (Dwyer-Lindgren et al. 2015), and percentage physically active and obese (available from 2001–2011) (DwyerLindgren et al. 2013). For the primary time-independent analysis,
covariate data were averaged over the available time and linked by
county to create a cross-sectional data set. For the latency analysis
that used 2008–2016 incidence rate data, only covariate data for
years before 2008 were averaged and linked. For the time-varying
model, covariate information from 2002–2011 were linked by
county-year. In addition, spatial indicator variables for urban vs.
rural (classified as urban if more than 50% of a county’s population
lived in an urbanized area of ≥50,000 people or an urban cluster of
between 2,500 and 50,000 people), state, and region (Pacific,
West, Midwest, Northeast, or South) were constructed.

cancers while controlling for important county-level covariates

[generalized additive model procedure in SAS (version 9.4; SAS
Institute, Inc.)]. In the primary analysis, incident rate ratios (IRRs)
and 95% CIs (per 10-lg=m[3] increase of PM2:5) were estimated by
regressing the natural logarithm of the average incidence rate for
selected cancer types in 607 counties from 1992–2016 on countylevel mean PM2:5 concentrations from 1988–2015. Specifically,
locally weighted smoothing (LOESS) models with three degrees
of freedom (df) were used to flexibly control for possible confounders including percentage of the county in various age buckets; percentage male; percentage white, black, Hispanic, and other;
percentage who did not graduate high school, graduated high
school, or obtained more education than high school; median
income, rent, and home value; percentage below 150% poverty;
percentage working class; percentage unemployed; percentage living in a rural area; percentage smokers; percentage alcohol consumption; percentage who are physically active; and percentage of
individuals in a county who are obese. Indicator variables for urban
vs. rural and state were also included in the model.
After estimating the IRRs and nominal p, two approaches
were used to adjust p to account for multiple testing. The first
approach was the Holm’s method—which is a common modification of the Bonferroni approach because it adjusts for multiple
comparisons by controlling the family-wise error rate and providing a somewhat more powerful approach to multiple significance
testing (Hochberg and Benjamini 1990). The nominal p for all
hypotheses tested are ordered from smallest to largest and given
a rank, based on their order (the smallest p is given a rank of 1).
The Holm-adjusted p are the nominal p multiplied by the total
number of tests minus the p rank plus one. The second approach,


the false discovery rate (FDR) method, controls for the false discovery rate and is an alternative modification of the Bonferroni
approach with more power than the Holm’s method (Benjamini
and Hochberg 1995). FDR p are obtained by multiplying the
nominal p by the total number of texts divided by rank order.
In addition to the primary analysis, time-varying linear regression models that accounted for changes in air pollution and cancer
incidence over time were estimated using county-year–level cancer incidence data from 2002–2011. IRRs (per 10-lg=m[3] increase
of PM2:5) were estimated by regressing the natural logarithm of the
yearly incidence rate on mean PM2:5 concentrations for 1-, 5-, 10-,
and 15-y lagged moving averages (to explore alternative cancer latency periods). To account for potential correlations within the
same counties over time, 95% CIs were based on robust covariance
estimators [Taylor series linearization, using SURVEYREG in
SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc.)]. To flexibly control for general changes in cancer incidence over time, annual indicator variables for each year (2002–2011) were included. Annual values of all
other covariables (percentage of the county in various age buckets;
percentage male; percentage white, black, Hispanic, and other; percentage who did not graduate high school, graduated high school,
or obtained more education than high school; median income, rent,
and home value; percentage below 150% poverty; percentage
working class; percentage unemployed; percentage living in a rural
area; percentage smokers; percentage alcohol consumption; percentage who are physically active; and percentage of individuals in
a county who are obese) were also included. In addition, indicator
variables for urban/rural and state were included.
To determine whether the results were sensitive to modeling
choices, the following additional models using the primary model

rates from 2008–2016 instead of 1992–2016 and PM2:5 exposure
from 1988–2007 as well as county averages for all covariates
from 1992–2007. Finally, to determine whether the results of the
primary model were sensitive to the inclusion of specific covariates, sensitivity analysis was performed by progressively adding
control variables into the primary model for selected cancer
types.
The shapes of the exposure–response curve for PM2:5 and
several cancer types were estimated using a LOESS model with
3 df. In addition, the exposure–response curves estimating the
association for percentage of a county who identify as smokers
and several cancer types were also created using a LOESS model
with 3 df. The effect of an increase in the prevalence of smoking
in a county on cancer incidence was then compared with the
effect of an increase of PM2:5 in a county on cancer incidence.

### Results
Figure 1 illustrates the average PM2:5 concentration from 1988–
2015 and average cancer incidence from 1992–2016 for counties
contained in the SEER database. Additional information regarding counties in the SEER registries (Table S1). The average
PM2:5 concentration across the counties contained in the SEER
program was 11:5 lg=m[3] and the average incidence rate for all
cancer was 588.8/100,000. Table 1 contains the total number of
cases for each cancer site in the SEER program database for the
primary analysis (SEER program counties from 1992–2016) and
for a sensitivity analysis (SEER program counties from 2008–
2016). In addition, the average yearly incidence rate is provided
for both the primary analysis and the sensitivity analysis for all
cancer sites. Table 2 contains the mean and standard deviation
for county characteristics that were included in the timeindependent (SEER program counties from 1992–2016), latency
sensitivity analysis (SEER program counties 1992–2007), and for
the time-varying model (SEER program counties 2002–2011).

Table 3 contains IRRs and 95% CI estimates for the association between a 10-lg=m[3] increase of PM2:5 from 1988–2015 and
selected cancer sites. Statistically significant positive associations
were found for oral, rectal, liver, lung, skin, and kidney cancers
as well as all cancer in aggregate. A borderline statistically significant effect was also found for breast cancer. However, after multiple comparisons adjustments using the Holm’s method, only
lung [IRR = 1:19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.30)], liver [IRR = 1:32 (95%
CI: 1.11, 1.57)], and all cancer [IRR = 1:09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.14)]
remained significant at a 0.05 level. Using the less conservative
FDR method, significant adverse associations were also observed
with skin and kidney cancers.

Figure 2 compares the IRR estimates for the base model with
estimates from time-varying models using various lagged moving
average estimates (1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-y) of exposure for all cancers
that were nominally significant at a 0.05 level in the primary analysis (all, lung, oral, rectal, liver, skin, breast, and kidney cancers).
Numeric results for all cancer types are provided in Table S2. The
associations for all, lung, oral, rectal, skin, and breast cancers and
PM2:5 were similar for the primary time-independent model and
the time-varying model—especially the time-varying models that

time-varying models and compared with the base (time-independent) model. Numerical estimates are included in Table S2. Open circles represent that estimates were not statistically significant at a 0.05 level. Diamonds represent the base (time-independent) model. Models adjusted for percentage of the county in
various age buckets; percentage male; percentage white, black, Hispanic, and other; percentage who did not graduate high school, graduated high school, or
obtained more education than high school; median income, rent, and home value; percentage below 150% poverty; percentage working class; percentage unemployed; percentage living in a rural area; percentage smokers; percentage alcohol consumption; percentage who are physically active; and percentage of individuals in a county who are obese as well as indicator variables for urban/rural, state, and year. The primary (time-independent) model used a LOESS model
with 3 df for all covariates. The linear models used linear yearly estimates for all covariates and 1-, 5-, 10-, and 15-y moving average estimates for PM2:5 exposure. The LOESS model was a locally weighted smoothing model with 3 df for all covariates with a 15-y moving average lagged estimate for PM2:5 exposure.
Note: CI, confidence interval; df, degrees of freedom; PM2:5, particles <2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter; LOESS, locally weighted smoothing model.


used the relatively longer-lagged moving average exposure periods
(10 or 15 y). However, for liver and kidney cancers, associations
were substantially sensitive to these modeling choices.

Figure 3 contains a forest plot that illustrates the sensitivity
analysis performed on those cancer sites that were statistically
significant based on the nominal p in the primary model.
Numerical results for all cancer sites are provided in Table S3.
The results were most statistically robust across modeling choices
for lung cancer. All, oral, and skin cancers were largely statistically significant across modeling choices, whereas rectal, liver,
breast, and kidney cancers varied substantially across modeling
choices. Figure S1 illustrates the sensitivity analysis where covariates were progressively added to the model for the selected cancer types. The estimated IRRs were sensitive to the inclusion of


the various levels of covariates. The adverse PM2:5–lung cancer
association was observed in all models and was most strongly
affected by controlling for smoking.

Figure 4 illustrates the lung cancer exposure–response
curves for county smoking prevalence and county-level PM2:5
concentrations. The relationships between lung cancer and
smoking prevalence and the concentration of PM2:5 in a county
are near linear. County-level smoking prevalence was more
strongly associated with lung cancer incidence than PM2:5.
Figure S2 presents a panel of exposure–response curves for all,
oral, rectal, liver, skin, breast, and kidney cancers. Unlike lung
cancer, the relationship between various cancer types and PM2:5
are not clearly linear, and occasionally PM2:5 has a larger effect
on cancer incidence than smoking.

Numerical estimates are included in Table S3. Open circles represent that estimates were not
statistically significant at a 0.05 level. Diamonds represent the primary time-independent and time-varying models. Models are adjusted for percentage of the
county in various age buckets; percentage male; percentage white, black, Hispanic, and other; percentage who did not graduate high school, graduated high

All models use the average incidence rate from 1992–
2016 (primary time-independent model) unless indicated otherwise. The models include the following: the primary (time-independent) model, a LOESS model
with 3 df was used for all covariates; a time-varying mode LOESS model with 3 df for all covariates with an additional indicator variable for year that included
a 15-y moving average lagged estimate for PM2:5 to estimate exposure for individuals living in SEER counties from 2002–2011; a cross-validated LOESS
model for all covariates; a cross-validated spline model for all covariates; a LOESS model with 3 df for all covariates, with the state removed from the model;
a LOESS model with 3 df for all covariates, with the state removed from the model and replaced with a region control; a LOESS model with 3 df for all covariates, with the state removed from the model and replaced with a SEER registry control; a linear regression model with only linear terms for the covariates,
assuming a Poisson distribution; a linear regression model with only linear terms for the covariates and with the sandwich method used to estimate standard
errors; a LOESS model with 3 df for all covariates, with mean PM2:5 exposure from 1999–2015; and a LOESS model with 3 df for all covariates, with mean
PM2:5 exposure from 1988–2007 on SEER counties from 2008–2016. Note: CI, confidence interval; df, degrees of freedom; LOESS, locally weighted smoothing model; PM2:5, particles <2:5 lm in aerodynamic diameter; SEER, Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.


### Discussion
A growing body of evidence indicates that lung cancer incidence is
associated with exposure to PM2:5 (IARC 2013; Bai et al. 2020;
Zhang et al. 2020). The present study supports this evidence, with a
statistically significant IRR of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.30), even after
conservatively adjusting for multiple comparisons (p = 0:01).
Furthermore, the lung cancer IRR is remarkably robust across modeling choices, spatial controls, and various exposure windows.
Although the present study estimates an IRR that is somewhat
higher than the estimate in a recent meta-analysis that examined the


association between PM2:5 exposure and lung cancer incidence

[risk ratio = 1:07 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.12)] (Huang et al. 2017), the IRR
from the present study is comparable to the meta-analysis mentioned previously for the association between exposure to PM2:5 and
lung cancer incidence or mortality [HR = 1:14 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.21)]
(Pope et al. 2020). Finally, the exposure–response curve provides
evidence that although smoking is a much larger risk factor for lung
cancer incidence, PM2:5 also contributes to the risk of lung cancer.
The results for non-lung cancers are less conclusive. Although
statistically significant associations were found for oral, rectal,

liver, skin, and kidney cancers in the base model, none of these cancer associations were highly robust across sensitivity analysis.
Furthermore, no association was found for PM2:5 and liver and kidney cancers when time-varying models were used. Previous studies
have found statistically significant associations for PM2:5 and mortality or incidence from oral and oropharyngeal (Chu et al. 2019),
colorectal (Coleman et al. 2020; Turner et al. 2017; Ancona et al.
2015), liver (Coleman et al. 2020; Ancona et al. 2015; Deng et
al. 2017; Pan et al. 2016; VoPham et al. 2018), skin (Datzmann et al.
2018) (used PM10 instead of PM2:5), breast (Coleman et al. 2020;
Ancona et al. 2015; Wong et al. 2016; Hu et al. 2013; White et al.
2019; DuPré et al. 2019), and kidney cancers (Turner et al. 2017;
Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2017). Furthermore, the association
between all cancer incidence and PM2:5 was statistically significant
IRR = 1:09 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.14), even after adjusting for multiple
comparisons (p = 0:04), indicating that the effect of exposure to
PM2:5 on cancer sites may not be limited to the lungs.
The present study has several strengths. First, the analysis is
based on well-documented cancer registry data that contains
>8:5 million cases of cancer. Second, this study was able to flexibly control for many relevant county-level risk factors, including
smoking, obesity, alcohol consumption, physical activity, income,
and education. Third, this study used incidence data instead of mortality data, which avoids the risk of confounding from other causes
of death. Finally, the cancer incidence, covariate, and air pollution
exposure data are all publicly available.
This study has several limitations. First, this ecological study
was unable to control for individual-level risk factors or pollution
exposure; therefore, the association between cancer incidence and
PM2:5 exposure found in this study may not reflect the individuallevel association between PM2:5 and cancer incidence. However,
other studies that have used individual-level data and controlled
for a greater variety of risk factors have found comparable associations for cancer mortality and PM2:5. Further, this study was unable
to control for all potential risk factors of cancer incidence. Several
potential confounders include occupational exposures, dietary patterns, diabetes status, or chronic hepatitis B and C virus infection
status. Furthermore, the present study found that progressively
adding covariates to the model had an impact on the association
between PM2:5 and cancer incidence, which suggests a possible
risk of residual confounding. Finally, the present study does not


estimate cancer incidence rates for various age, sex, and race/ethnicity categories. Future studies should examine these associations
to determine whether differences in exposure across various substrata, especially race/ethnicity, lead to a substantial difference in
PM2:5–cancer incidence associations (Zou et al. 2014).
The present study is also limited in its ability to directly measure
PM2:5 exposures. County-level PM2:5 concentrations are generated
using population-weighted averages of U.S. Census block-level–
modeled estimates that cannot account for the full range of spatial
variability. Sensitivity analyses suggest that most cancer associations are not highly sensitive to regional, state, or SEER cancer
registry spatial control. It is unclear, however, how the estimates
would be affected if the analysis could be conducted at the U.S.
Census tract or block level. In addition, the present study had a limited ability to identify the most relevant PM2:5 exposure window for
cancer incidence. The present study found that the associations
between PM2:5 and cancer incidence are not sensitive to changes in
the exposure windows from 1988–2015, 1999–2015, 1988–2007.
Especially for lung cancer, stronger associations were observed for
10- or 15-y lagged moving averages vs. 1- or 5-y lagged moving
averages—indicative of a relatively long latency period. This study
was unable to generate reliable exposure estimates before 1988.
Finally, the primary index of air pollution used in this analysis is
PM2:5, which does not account for spatial differences in the constituents or characteristics of PM2:5 or of various co-pollutants.
The present study supports the growing body of evidence that
increased PM2:5 exposure is associated with lung cancer incidence. Furthermore, it provides moderate evidence that PM2:5 exposure may be associated with the incidence of cancer at other
sites, such as oral and oropharyngeal, rectal, liver, skin, breast,
and kidney. Although PM2:5 is likely not a primary risk factor for
cancer incidence, the pervasive nature of air pollution exposure
makes further study essential to public health.
