**Background: Ambient air pollution is a human carcinogen and a possible risk factor for prostate cancer.**
**Methods: We investigated associations between ambient concentrations particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)**
and incident prostate cancer in a Canadian case-control study. Between 1994 and 1997, cases were identified from provincial
cancer registries, and a population-based series of controls was recruited. Among men 50 years of age or older, risk factor and residential history data (1975 to 1994) were collected from 1,420 prostate cancer cases and 1,424 controls. Three methods were used
to estimate the residential mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 during this period: (1) satellite-derived observations; (2) satellite-derived
observations scaled with historical fixed-site measurements; and (3) a national land-use regression (LUR) model. Odds ratios (ORs)
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in relation to interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM2.5 and NO2 were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for personal and contextual factors.
**Results: We found positive associations between exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 over the previous 20 years and prostate cancer. An**
IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.56 µg/m[3] for satellite and 4.48 µg/m[3] for scaled satellite observations) yielded ORs of 1.28 (95% CI = 1.07,
1.52) and 1.20 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.40), respectively. For NO2, IQR increases (1.45 ppb for satellite, 15.18 ppb for scaled satellite-derived information, and 15.39 ppb for the national LUR) were associated with ORs of 1.09 (95% CI = 0.95, 1.24), 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02,
1.43), and 1.19 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.38), respectively.
**Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that ambient air pollution increases the risk of prostate cancer.**

#### Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer
and the fifth leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide.[1]
In 2021, there were an estimated 24,000 new cases of prostate
cancer and 4,500 deaths in Canada.[2]
Currently, age, ethnicity, and family history of prostate cancer are the only established risk factors for prostate cancer, but
these are not modifiable.[3] The role of several modifiable risk factors has been evaluated but the findings have been inconsistent.

These factors include lifestyle (diet, physical activity, anthropometry) and occupational exposures (e.g., cadmium, pesticides).[4,5] Studies of prostate cancer in migrants and as well as
observed geographical variations in prostate cancer incidence
rates suggest that environmental exposures are etiologically
relevant.[6]
Ambient air pollution is characterized by the contamination
of the environment by chemical, physical, or biological agents.
The most common sources are emissions from motor vehicles,
combustion processes of solid fuels, and industry.[7] Fine particles
with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are among the most commonly studied
air pollutants. NO2 is a marker for vehicle emissions and contain
carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
and benzo(a)pyrene.[8] Air pollution is a recognized risk factor
for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and in 2013, the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified
particulate matter air pollution as a human carcinogen.[9–11] While
there is sufficient evidence of an association between air pollution and lung cancer, the evidence for other cancer sites is limited.
The possibility that air pollution increases the risk of developing
nonrespiratory cancers is strengthened with findings of positive

**What this study adds**

Prostate cancer remains an important public health problem
because it is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer in
men. In this study, we examined the potential role of outdoor
air pollution in its etiology. This study found that exposure to
NO2 and PM2.5 was associated with an increased risk of prostate
cancer. The findings presented in this article fill an important
research gap as few studies have previously evaluated associations between air pollution and prostate cancer. This study
adds to the growing epidemiological literature that exposure to
ambient air pollution may increase the risk of nonrespiratory


-----

associations for brain, colorectal, and breast cancer.[12–14] For
prostate cancer, few studies have assessed the impact of air pollution on incidence and the findings have been mixed.[15–19] There
are several plausible mechanisms whereby exposure to air pollution increases the risk of prostate cancer. Air pollution-related
chemicals can potentially act directly on the prostate through cell
membrane disruption, induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines
and tumor necrosis factor α, and apoptosis by the mitochondria; in addition, PAHs, benzene, and cadmium can act indirectly
through endocrine-disrupting properties.[20,21]
Given the relatively few studies on air pollution and prostate
cancer and the inconsistency in their findings, we sought to evaluate associations between past long-term exposure to ambient
NO2 and PM2.5 using a previously conducted Canadian population-based case-control study.

#### Methods

_Study design_

Our study population was drawn from the Canadian National
Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System (NECSS). The NECSS
is a large multisite cancer population-based case-control study
conducted between 1994 and 1997. Data were collected from
participants who resided in eight of the 10 Canadian provinces
(all provinces but Quebec and New Brunswick). The overall aim
of the NECSS was to identify environmental causes of cancer.
Detailed methods for the NECSS are published elsewhere.[22]
Briefly, in this population-based case-control study, incident
cancer cases were identified by provincial cancer registries. The
NECSS included cancer cases for 19 different types of cancer
sites. All cancers were histologically confirmed diagnoses of
cancer and classified using the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) rubrics.[23] Controls were selected
during the same time period as the cases from a random sample of individuals from each of the participating provinces, the
age and sex distribution of controls in the NECSS was frequency-matched to the age-sex distribution across all 19 types of
cancers. For age, frequency matching was done by 5-year age
groupings. The control selection strategy varied by province
depending on data availability and accessibility: Provincial
health insurance plans (95% of individuals are covered by
this type of service; however, military personnel and their families and Aboriginals were excluded because they are covered
by other plans) were used in British Columbia, Saskatchewan,
Manitoba, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia; In Ontario,
controls were selected using data from the Ministry of Finance
Property Assessment, whereas in Alberta and Newfoundland,
random digit dialing was used.
The NECSS sought the participation of 2,781 histologically
confirmed incident prostate cancer cases (ICD-9: 185) that were
initially identified. Of these, 414 men were excluded from the
study for any of the following reasons: patient had died, incorrect mailing address, or physician consent was not granted.
Self-administered surveys were mailed to the remaining 2,367
men, and of these, 1,799 were completed and returned, representing a 76% participation rate. Questionnaires were mailed to
4,235 men identified as potential controls. For 287 of these men
(6.8%), questionnaires were returned indicating an incorrect
address. Among controls, 2,547 men completed and returned
the questionnaire representing a 64.5% participation rate.
We restricted the analysis to cases and controls 50 years of age
and older as diagnoses of prostate cancer at younger ages are rare
and tend to reflect genetic susceptibility rather than an environmental cause.[24] This was a relatively small number of cases (n = 12).

_Data collection_

Participants were asked to provide demographic information
including age ethnicity socioeconomic status (SES) education


and residential history. The questionnaire also asked participants to provide anthropometric measures (height and weight),
as well as information on their smoking history, exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke, alcohol consumption, physical
activity, and dietary patterns. Self-reported measures of exposure to pesticides and cadmium were also collected. A complete
residential history (since the age of 18) was sought, and participants were asked to provide their address, including their
six-character postal code.

_Exposure assessment to air pollution_

Based on residential histories, an average air pollution exposure concentration was assigned to each participant for each
year between 1975 and 1994. We restricted analyses to subjects
with 20 years of exposure in the main analyses. Exposures were
derived by a member of the team (P.H.) and details about the
methodology that was used have previously been published.[25] In
brief, this exposure characterization involved first geocoding the
six-character postal codes from the residential histories using the
1996 DMTI Spatial, Inc (Markham, Ontario, Canada). postal
code database. In Canadian urban areas, a six-character postal
code represents a specific block (one side of a street between two
intersecting streets), a single building or sometimes a large volume mail receiver, while in rural areas, a 6-character postal code
represents larger areas, sometimes an entire town or county.[26,27]
After geocoding the postal address’s location to assign the NO2
and PM2.5 concentrations of the subjects for all addresses they
lived at during the study period, we assigned pollution concentrations using three methods. We opted to model three different
exposure metrics as these measures have distinct strengths and
limitations. For example, our satellite measurements were able
to cover large geographical areas including those not covered by
ground-based fixed-site monitors. The satellite measures could
also be back-extrapolate to provide historical measures of air
pollution concentrations. However, the satellite-derived exposure metric was limited in that the spatial resolution was modest
(10 × 10 km). the land-use regression (LUR) model, on the other
hand, provided a highly spatially resolved surface that could
better capture smaller within-city variations in exposure but
lacked the temporal component. Our decision to model these
three metrics allowed us to better understand how the temporal and spatial components of these exposures impacted disease
risks. The metrics are described in more detail below.

_Satellite measures of PM2.5 and NO2_
NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from satellite measurements (using 2005–2007 retrievals for NO2 and
2001–2006 retrievals for PM2.5) at 10 × 10 km resolution,
scaled with a chemical transport model to estimate ground-level
concentrations.[28,29]

_Scaled measures of PM2.5 and NO2_
To account for long-term spatiotemporal trends in air pollution
between 1975 and 1994, we estimated the annual air pollutant
concentrations during this period using satellite data that were
calibrated using information from the National Air Pollution
Surveillance (NAPS) network.[30] The calibration was carried out
as follows:
NAPS monitoring data were first organized into monthly
averages for both NO2 and PM2.5. Continuous monitoring data
were included if at least 50% of the daily hourly observations
were available and at least 50% of days were available in a
month. Annual averages were calculated when complete data
were available for at least 6 months with at least one month per
season. Given the lack of spatial and temporal measurements

total suspended particles (TSPs) between 1984 and 2000 were
used to create predictive models of historical PM2.5 concentrations: random effects linear regression models (GLIMMIX procedure in SAS 9.3, Cary, North Carolina) were developed to
account for the clustering of annual measurements over time at
each NAPS monitoring station. The _R[2] and root mean square_
error (RMSE) were 0.67 and 2.31, respectively; the resulting
model was applied to all valid TSP monitoring stations. Next,
at each ground-based fixed monitoring site, a ratio of annual
measured concentration of NO2 and PM2.5 to the satellite estimated concentration was computed, and then we conducted
smoothed inverse distance weighting interpolation of the ratios.
The resulting interpolated areas were multiplied by the original
satellite area, generating histories of the adjusted annual NO2
and PM2.5 estimates for each year from 1975 to 1994.

_Land-use regression surface for NO2_
For the third method (LUR surface for NO2), data were provided by the Canadian Consortium on Urban Environmental
Health (CANUE: www.canue.ca). Details of the method used
to generate these data are provided elsewhere.[31] Briefly, the
national NO2 LUR model was developed using 2006 NAPS
fixed-site monitoring data. To capture background and regional
NO2 variation, NO2 satellite estimates from 2005 to 2011, area
of industrial land use within 2 km, road length within 10 km
and summer rainfall were used as predictors. To capture localscale variations, distance-decay gradients were developed from
a literature review and applied to the regression model estimates
for postal codes near highways (NO2 increases around 65%
near highways and decreases to background levels at 300 m)
and major roads (NO2 increases around 20% near major roads
and decreases to background level at 100 m). The final LUR
model explained 73% of the variation in NAPS measurements
with a RMSE of 2.9 ppb and matches well with city-specific
NO2 land-use regression models, which typically have R[2] values
between 0.54 and 0.81.[32] The model was developed for all study
postal codes to estimate concentrations of NO2, and we then
calculated an average concentration for the 1975–1994 exposure period; NO2 concentrations for year 1984 were assigned to
years prior to 1984.

_Roadways measures_

We assessed proximity to roadways as an alternative surrogate
measure of vehicle emissions. Due to the lack of historical data
on the national road network, we used the 1996 road network
data (DMTI Spatial, Inc.); from this, we estimated estimate the
number of years lived within 50,100 and 300 m of roads (highway and/or major road). This variable was transformed into a
two-category variable: subjects who never lived near these roads
and the others who lived near either or both.

_Covariates_

Individual characteristics collected from the survey were used to
derive a series of adjustment factors for inclusion in our models, including: ethnicity (Caucasian, Black, Asian, and other),
alcohol consumption (servings/week), smoking (pack-years),
physical activity (number of hours per month of moderate and
strenuous activity), total caloric intake (derived from a food-frequency questionnaire about recent intakes), body mass index
(BMI) (<20, 20 to <25, 25 to <30, and ≥30 kg/m[2]), self-reported
exposure to pesticides and cadmium at home or at work (never/
ever), and level of education and residential surrounding greenness.[33–35] The latter was based on the Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a commonly used measure
of vegetation. Our measure of NDVI covered a 500 m buffer
d th id f 20 (b t 1975 d 1994)


The neighborhood socioeconomic status index (in quintiles)
was also considered as a potential confounder as it has been
shown that less affluent neighborhoods have, on average, higher
concentrations of air pollution[36,37]; moreover, men who live in
a socially advantaged neighborhoods have been found to be
greater risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer.[38]

_Statistical analysis_

We used (unconditional) logistic regression to estimate odds
ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of associations between exposure to air pollution and prostate cancer.
We modeled these association in relation to an interquartile
range (IQR) increase in NO2 (1.45 ppb, 15.18 ppb, and 15.39
ppb for satellite, scaled, and LUR, respectively) and PM2.5 (3.56
µg/m[3] and 4.48 µg/m[3] for satellite and scaled satellite, respectively). This allowed us to compare the strength of the association across the different pollutants and metrics. For all analyses,
three different models were fit:

  - Model 1: included only age and province of residence at
the time of completing the survey.

  - Model 2: same variables as model 1 and additional personal potential confounders: ethnicity, BMI, alcohol consumption, total caloric intake, education, moderate and
strenuous physical activity, smoking, exposures to pesticide
and cadmium.

  - Model 3: same variables as model 2 with the addition
of two contextual variables: a long-term neighborhood
socioeconomic status index and residential surrounding
greenness.

Age, smoking, education, total calorie intake, alcohol consumption, moderate and strenuous physical activity, and greenness were modeled as continuous variables after confirming
linearity of the logits. We assessed the shape of the exposure-response function between exposure to pollutants and prostate cancer by using a cubic smoothing splines function with
4 degrees of freedom (df).[39]
Due to the presence of missing data for some covariates
(ranging from 0.13% to 21.1%) and assuming that the mechanism behind them was either Missing Completely at Random
(MCAR) or Missing at Random (MAR), we conducted multiple
imputations using chained equations (MICE).[40] The main results
presented herein are based on analyses that used imputation.

_Sensitivity analyses_

In addition to the main analyses, we performed sensitivity analyses by restricting to participants with complete data to evaluate
the robustness of the results when compared to findings based
on imputed data. Because of postal codes in rural areas are not
highly spatially resolved, we also performed separate analyses
restricted to subjects living in urban areas (which corresponds
to an area with a population of at least 1,000).[41]

#### Results

The original NECSS data set included 4,346 cases and controls;
1,502 subjects were excluded for one of the following reasons:
missing address, age <50 years, and < 20 years of residential history between 1975 and 1994. As a result, a total of 2,844 subjects (1,420 cases and 1,424 controls) were included in our study
(flow chart presented in Supplementary Material: Figure S1;
[http://links.lww.com/EE/A194).](http://links.lww.com/EE/A194)
Table 1 shows the risk factor distributions for several characteristics among cases and controls. The average age at diagnosis in our case series was 66.7 years (±5.6 years), while the
mean age in the control series was 65.5 years (±6.4 years). Study

in BMI distributions between cases and controls, pack-years
were higher among controls than cases, and most cases were
in the 4th and 5th (most favorable) quintile of the neighborhood SES index, while most controls were in the 1st and 3rd
quintile. The distribution of pollutants concentrations varied by
province with Ontario having the highest concentrations and
Newfoundland the lowest. Figure 1 shows the distributions of
NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations for cases and controls (The differences in the means were tested using the Student t test). The
average 20-year concentration of pollutants was slightly higher
for cases compared to controls: 1.4 ppb (±1.2) versus 1.4 ppb
(±1.3); 16.3 ppb (±9.0) versus 15.5 ppb (±8.9); and 19.8 ppb
(±11.6) versus 18.8 ppb (±11.8) for NO2 from satellite, scaled
NO2, and NO2 from national LUR, respectively. For PM2.5 from
satellite and scaled PM2.5, it was 7.7 µg/m[3] (±2.4) versus 7.8 µg/m[3]
(±2.5) and 12.0 µg/m[3] (±3.0) versus 11.9 µg/m[3] (±3.0) in cases
and controls, respectively.

_Association between prostate cancer and air pollution_

The results from the three regression models for each exposure are shown in Table 2. For NO2, the model adjusted only
for age and province (model 1) showed a modest association
with prostate cancer risk regardless of the measure considered. In contrast, after adjustment for several personal factors
(model 2), the scaled estimates and the national LUR estimates
were indicative of elevated risks, with ORs of 1.20 (95%
CI = 1.03, 1.41) for a 15.18 ppb increase in NO2 and 1.16
(95% CI = 1.01, 1.33) for a 15.39 ppb, respectively. Satellite
surface-based risk estimates were weaker. Finally, for the fully
adjusted model (model 3), there was a positive association for
scaled estimates (OR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.02, 1.43) and for
national LUR estimates (OR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.38).
Again, the strength of association with satellite surface estimates was weaker.
We observed positive associations between long-term PM2.5
exposure and prostate cancer incidence in all analyses except for
scaled estimates in model 1. Using estimates of exposure from
satellite, we found increased odds ratios of prostate cancer per

functions for other exposures were consistent with linearity and
ORs increased proportionally to the concentration of the pollutant, with wider confidence intervals at the extremes due to the
small number of subjects.
Regarding the proximity to roads, while no clear increase in
odds was apparent with prostate cancer risk, the odds of prostate cancer tended to be somewhat higher among those who
had ever lived near roads relative to those who had not (results

Compared to the results on imputed data, after analysis on complete data, there were no material differences in the ORs between
models 1 and 2. The adjusted odds ratios were, however, slightly
lower for model 3 (see results in Supplementary Material: Table

a positive association was observed for satellite observations of
PM2.5 in all three models as well as for scaled PM2.5 estimates in
model 2 (weaker in model 3). For NO2, a positive association
was also observed for scaled estimates in model 2 and national
LUR estimates in model 3 (weaker in model 2). For the analysis restricted to those who lived in urban area, the results on
the imputed data showed that for an IQR increase, ORs tended
to be higher than when rural subjects were included (results
[in Supplementary Material: Table S3; http://links.lww.com/](http://links.lww.com/EE/A194)
[EE/A194). For example, the fully adjusted ORs for NO2 were](http://links.lww.com/EE/A194)
1.10 (95% CI = 0.96, 1.26), 1.27 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.54), and
1.24 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.45) for satellite surface-based estimates,
scaled estimates, and national LUR estimates, respectively. For
PM2.5, the fully adjusted ORs were 1.31 (CI = 1.07, 1.60) and
1.21 (CI = 1.02, 1.44) for satellite surface-based estimates and

#### Discussion

Overall, we found that ambient NO2 and PM 2.5 over a 20-year

There have been few previous studies of this topic, and for two
of these studies, prostate cancer was not the cancer of a priori interest.[18,19] Previous studies typically considered only one
pollutant and used different approaches to estimate long-term
exposures. In our study, three approaches were used: satellite
observations, which have the advantage of covering large geographical areas but whose nonoptimal spatial resolution limits
the use, scaled satellite measurements (corresponding to the calibration of satellite observations with fixed sites of monitoring
stations spread over the Canadian territory), which allowed for
the temporal adjustment of satellite observations, and finally
the national LUR model, which has a better spatial resolution
and considers the local-scale variation of pollution, representing
here the best approach to the estimation of the spatial variation
of NO2.
Our positive findings are consistent with two other case-control studies of incident prostate cancer conducted in Montreal.
The study by Parent et al[16] focused on exposure to NO2 (in 2006
and 1996, i.e., 10 years before) measured using the LUR model.
The other study by Weichenthal et al[15] studied concentrations
of ambient ultrafine particles (at the time of recruitment and 10
years before recruitment) measured using a LUR model. While we
also found positive associations, the comparison of our findings
to their is not straightforward due to differences in exposure periods, and methods to characterize exposure. Namely, we examined
exposure over a period extending from 1975 to 1994, whereas
these two studies examined exposure at recruitment and 10 years
earlier. An ecological study carried out in the United States in
Erie County (Pennsylvania) found an association between exposure to airborne particles (measured from monitors at different
monitoring stations over a period of 2 years) and prostate cancer.[17] Nevertheless, not all previous studies have reported positive associations. For example, a Danish cohort study of 57,053
subjects (men and women) recruited between 1993 and 1997
and followed up until 2006 that investigated the relationship
between NO2 and 20 different types of cancers found an association between NO2 exposure and cervical and brain cancer but
not with prostate cancer.[18] To our knowledge, our study is the
only one to report associations between proximity to roads and

using this metric, contrasting with the others, may reflect the fact
that distances to road metrics are less capable of capturing variations in exposure, such as due to traffic volume, than the other
methods we used. Some studies have shown that agreement is
not always good between air pollution measures from land-use
regression surfaces and distance to roadway measures,[41] and that
LUR models are better predictors of traffic-related pollution.[42]
Our study has some limitations. Selection bias cannot be ruled
out due to modest participation rates (76% for cases and 64.5%
for controls) and exclusion of some subjects because they did
not meet the inclusion criteria. However, it was observed that
after adjusting for factors typically related to nonresponse (e.g.,
income, education), there were no appreciable changes in the
risk estimates. This suggests the potential for participation bias
is small.[43] In addition, in our view, participation bias is likely
minimal given that the risk estimates obtained from the NECSS
data across a series of etiological risk factors for different cancer sites are similar to other published risk estimates. These
risk factors have included diesel, obesity, and smoking, radon,
and numerous others.[44–46] Second, our analysis was limited due
to missing covariates data. To mitigate this potential bias, we
used multiple imputation, which represents a robust and valid
approach for managing missing data and for obtaining unbiased
estimators.[40] Our sensitivity analyses suggest that there were no
major differences in our measures of association between the
imputed and nonimputed approaches. Third, the participants
were not uniformly distributed geographically. However, the
design of the NECSS study was such that each provincial cancer registry was responsible for sampling and recruiting study
participants and a province variable was included in the models
to capture any differences in sampling strategies. Fourth, residual confounding is possible in light of imperfectly measured or
unknown confounders. Fifth, autopsy studies have shown that
in men over 50 years of age, the prevalence of latent histological
prostate cancer can be as high as 30%.[47,48] Consequently, our
controls likely included small proportion of undiagnosed prostate cancers, and this may have attenuated our risk estimates.
In our study, we lack information about the aggressiveness of
the disease or information about screening. Aggressive prostate
cancer corresponds to a high-risk cancer, meaning it is likely
to spread quickly outside the prostate. Although prostate cancer is quite common, almost 15% of all cancers at the time of
diagnosis are aggressive.[49] Given that a percentage of prostate
cancer cases are latent, the positive associations observed in our
study may reflect increased detection rates due to a higher prevalence of prostate cancer screening that occurs in some subpopulations. Several variables potentially correlated with screening
(age, level of education, neighborhood SES index and ethnicity)
were included in the models as adjustment variables, mitigating
this potential bias to some extent. In our model, adjusting on the
neighborhood socioeconomic status index (a composite variable
including other variables such as household income, education,
employment, living in rental housing or having moved in the last
5 years), overadjustment remains a possibility. We nevertheless
considered it in the adjustments since its link with prostate cancer may exist through other known or unknown unmeasured
factors. The latency period was chosen in accordance with the
natural history of prostate cancer, but this choice may not be
ideal. Different approaches were used to estimate air pollutants
concentrations and they have some limitations, including the
use of six-character postal codes to geolocate the residential
addresses. These postal codes are accurate in urban areas but
less so in rural areas as they can cover much larger areas (the
sensitivity analysis characterized by the exclusion of subjects
from rural areas effectively showed higher ORs); with the satellite method, it is assumed that the spatial patterns remained the
same from 1975 to 2005 for NO2 and from 1975 to 2001 for
PM2.5 and the resolution was limited to 10 km[2]; by integrating
historical data, the calibration of these satellite data has partially


addressed this concern; furthermore, concerning scaled PM2.5,
the poor spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring prior to
1984 led to the use of historical data based on TSP monitoring
data and Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) indicator variables.
These limitations potentially led to nondifferential misclassification in that the assessments were made independently of the
case-control status of the subjects. Finally, although we were
able to estimate exposure from residential histories, no information was available for other important microenvironments such
as workplaces or transportation.
The study benefits from several strengths. First, we examined a large sample of prostate cancer cases (1,420 cases and
1,424 controls). In addition, the study was based on the population-based enrollment of incident cases and the use of standardized questionnaires to collect information for a wide array
of risk factors. We also had detailed information on residential
history, which allowed us to construct detailed exposure metrics
for an etiologically relevant time period and to assign NDVI
levels, which have been inversely associated with ambient PM2.5
and also to prostate cancer.[50,51] We were also able to evaluate
associations for two pollutants using exposure derived from
both land-use regression and satellite imaging. The former provides a more spatially resolved measure of air pollution,[52] but
findings based on the different approaches allow the impacts of
temporality and spatial resolution to be evaluated. For example, a comparison of findings across the three metrics of NO2
suggests that, for risk characterization, it is important to capture intra-urban variations in concentrations. Several sensitivity
analyses confirmed the robustness of our main findings.

#### Conclusions

We found a positive association between air pollution and prostate cancer risk, providing further evidence in support of IARC’s
classification of outdoor air pollution as a human carcinogen.[10]
We recognize that few studies to date evaluated the role of air
pollution in the development of prostate cancer, and that more
work is needed in this area. In light of the study limitations,
and of the significant clinical and economic burden of prostate
cancer on the population, future research should account for the
role of screening in the early detection of prostate cancer, and
by extension, characterize variations in risk by prostate cancer
aggressiveness.
