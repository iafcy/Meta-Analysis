Several studies have indicated weakly increased risk for kidney cancer among occupational groups exposed to gasoline
vapors, engine exhaust, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other air pollutants, although not consistently. It was the aim
to investigate possible associations between outdoor air pollution at the residence and the incidence of kidney parenchyma
cancer in the general population. We used data from 14 European cohorts from the ESCAPE study. We geocoded and assessed
air pollution concentrations at baseline addresses by land-use regression models for particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PMcoarse,
PM2.5 absorbance (soot)) and nitrogen oxides (NO2, NOx), and collected data on traffic. We used Cox regression models with
adjustment for potential confounders for cohort-specific analyses and random effects models for meta-analyses to calculate
summary hazard ratios (HRs). The 289,002 cohort members contributed 4,111,908 person-years at risk. During follow-up
(mean 14.2 years) 697 incident cancers of the kidney parenchyma were diagnosed. The meta-analyses showed higher HRs in
association with higher PM concentration, e.g. HR 5 1.57 (95%CI: 0.81–3.01) per 5 lg/m[3] PM2.5 and HR 5 1.36 (95%CI:
0.84–2.19) per 10[2][5]m[2][1] PM2.5 absorbance, albeit never statistically significant. The HRs in association with nitrogen oxides
and traffic density on the nearest street were slightly above one. Sensitivity analyses among participants who did not change
residence during follow-up showed stronger associations, but none were statistically significant. Our study provides
suggestive evidence that exposure to outdoor PM at the residence may be associated with higher risk for kidney parenchyma
cancer; the results should be interpreted cautiously as associations may be due to chance.


What’s new?
Ambient air pollution is an established cause of lung cancer. It is of considerable public health interest whether air pollution
also causes other cancers. A few studies indicated that air pollution might cause kidney cancer. These authors investigated a
possible link between kidney parenchyma cancer and air pollution at the residence of 289,002 participants of 14 European
cohorts. They found an increased risk in association with particulate matter air pollution, although not statistically significant.


Introduction
A working group established under the International Agency
for Research on Cancer recently classified outdoor air pollution in general, and particulate matter (PM) in particular, as
carcinogenic to humans.[1] This classification was based on,
among others, an extensive review of the epidemiological literature, which provided convincing evidence for an association with lung cancer. Positive associations were also noted
for cancer of the urinary bladder and childhood leukemia,
whereas associations between air pollution and other cancers
had only been sparsely studied.[1]

Over 90% of kidney cancers develop in the kidney parenchyma and the vast majority of these are adenocarcinomas
(often denoted as renal cell carcinomas); the <10% of kidney
cancers, which develops in the renal pelvis, are primarily of
the transitional cell type.[2] Worldwide, the incidence rates of
kidney cancer increased until the mid-1990s when they
plateaued or declined in many countries.[2] Incidence rates of
kidney parenchyma cancer are relatively high in Europe with
rates between 3 and 15 per 100,000 in different countries.[2]


Active tobacco smoking, obesity and hypertension are established risk factors for cancer of the kidney parenchyma[2,3]

and there is also suggestive evidence for, among others, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.[4,5] Several studies of
occupational groups, such as transport workers, drivers,
policemen, metal foundry workers and gasoline service station workers exposed to gasoline vapors, engine exhaust,
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other air pollutants,
have indicated weakly increased risk for kidney cancer,[6–8]

although the literature is neither consistent[9] nor conclusive.[10]

Garcia-Perez et al. found higher kidney cancer mortality in
Spanish general populations exposed to ambient air pollution
from incinerators and hazardous waste treatment plants[11]

and a cohort study of a general Danish population found
positive but statistically insignificant associations between
nitrogen oxides (NOx) at the residence and kidney cancer
incidence but no association with amount of street traffic
near the residence.[12] Further, ultrafine particles can translocate from the airways to the kidney and other organs of
experimental animals[13] and experiments have shown that

diesel particles can induce cancer-relevant processes in the
kidneys.[14,15]

We recently reported from the European Study of Cohorts
for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) that PM in outdoor air
with a diameter <10 mm (PM10) and 2.5 mm (PM2.5) at the
residence is associated with risk for the development of lung
cancer[16] and natural-cause mortality.[17]

The aim of our study was to investigate a possible association
between outdoor air pollution and the risk for cancer of the
kidney parenchyma in general European populations, applying
the methods developed in ESCAPE.

Materials and Methods
Design and participants
The ESCAPE study on lung cancer included 12 European areas
where air pollution measurements were performed, land use
regression (LUR) models were developed, and adult cohort
studies with cancer incidence data were located. Our study
included the 14 cohorts, located in 10 areas, with information
on incident cancer, the most important potential confounders,


with at least 20 incident kidney parenchyma cancer cases during
follow-up and where the resources needed for participation
were available. The 14 cohorts were in Sweden (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition[EPIC]-Umeå,
Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen

[SNAC-K], Stockholm Screening Across the Lifespan Twin
Study and TwinGene [SALT], Stockholm 60 years old and
IMPROVE study [60-y/IMPROVE], Stockholm Diabetes Prevention Program [SDPP]), Norway (Oslo Health Study

[HUBRO]), Denmark (Diet, Cancer and Health Study [DCH]),
the Netherlands (EPIC-Monitoring Project on Risk Factors and
Chronic Diseases in the Netherlands [MORGEN], EPIC-PROSPECT), the United Kingdom (EPIC-Oxford), Austria (Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Prevention Programme

[VHM&PP]), Italy (EPIC-Varese, EPIC-Turin) and Spain
(EPIC-San Sebastian; Fig. 1). Our previous study on lung cancer
included 312,944 participants of 17 cohorts in 12 study areas.
Our study on kidney parenchyma cancer included 289,002 participants, i.e. a large fraction of our previous study. Most of the
study areas were large cities and the surrounding suburban or

rural communities, as specified in the online appendix (pp. 4–
13). A pooled analysis of all cohort data was not possible due to
data-transfer and privacy issues but data from the four Stockholm cohorts (SNAC-K, SALT, 60-y/IMPROVE and SDPP)
were pooled, and analyzed and denoted as one cohort (Cardiovascular Effects of Air pollution and Noise in Stockholm

[CEANS]) in the following. Similarly, data from the two cohorts
from the Netherlands (EPIC-MORGEN and EPIC-PROSPECT)
were pooled, analyzed and denoted as one [EPIC-NL]. Thus, ten
cohort data sets were analyzed. Information on lifestyle etc.
among cohort participants was obtained by questionnaires or
interviews at enrolment (see online appendix, Supplementary
Table S1). The local ethical and data protection authorities
approved the use of cohort data. All participants signed
informed consent forms at enrolment.

Definition of incident cancer of the kidney parenchyma
We included cancers located in the kidney parenchyma
(ICD10/ICDO3: C64). We only included primary cancers
(i.e., not metastases). The cohort members were followed up
for cancer incidence in national or local cancer registries.


Exposure assessment
Annual outdoor air pollution concentrations at the baseline
residential addresses of study participants were estimated by
LUR models in a three-step, standardized procedure that has
been described elsewhere.[18,19] First, PM with an aerodynamic
diameter <10 mm (PM10), PM with aerodynamic diameter
<2.5 mm (PM2.5), PM2.5 absorbance (a marker for black carbon
and soot), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and nitrogen oxides
(NOx) were measured three times during different seasons at
locations for each cohort population between October 2008
and April 2011. Coarse PM was calculated as the difference
between PM10 and PM2.5. In the Umeå, Varese and San Sebastian areas only NO2 and NOx was measured. Results from
the three measurements were averaged, adjusting for temporal trends using data from a background monitoring site with
continuous data.[18,20] PM filters were weighed before and after
each measurement centrally at IRAS, Utrecht University. Second, we collected information about potential predictor variables relating to nearby traffic intensity, population/household
density and land use from Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), and evaluated these to explain spatial variation of
annual average concentrations using regression modelling.[18,19] In general, predictors for PM10, PM2.5, NOx and NO2
related to traffic/roads and population/building density. Variables related to industry, port and altitude were also predictors in some models. These LUR models were evaluated
using Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation, which successively
leaves one site out of the data and refits the model with the
remaining N-1 sites. The models generally explained a large
fraction of measured spatial variation, the r[2] from leave-oneout cross-validation usually falling between 0.60 and 0.80.[16]

Finally, we used the models to assess exposure at the baseline
address of each cohort member. If values of predictor


variables for the cohort addresses were outside the range of
values for the monitoring sites, we truncated the values to
the minimum or maximum values at the monitoring sites.
We truncated to prevent unrealistic predictions (e.g., related
to too small distance to roads in GIS) and because we did
not want to extrapolate the derived model beyond the range,
for which it was developed. Truncation has been shown to
improve predictions at independent sites.[21] We also collected
information on traffic intensity (vehicles/day) on the nearest
street. As part of the TRANSPHORM project, we used similar methods to predict concentrations of eight elements in
PM at participants’ baseline addresses[22,23]; we describe these
procedures in the online appendix (pp. 2).

Statistical analyses. The association between long-term
exposure to air pollution and incidence of kidney parenchyma
cancer was analyzed in each cohort separately at the local centre by common standardized protocols for exposure assessment, outcome definition, confounder models and statistical
analyses. Cohort-specific effect estimates were combined by
meta-analysis at the Danish Cancer Society Research Center,
Copenhagen, Denmark.
We fitted Cox proportional hazards regression models for
each cohort, with age as the underlying time scale and followed
up participants from enrolment until the time of a kidney
parenchyma cancer diagnosis or censoring. We excluded participants with a cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer)
before enrolment and censored at the time of death, a diagnosis
of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer), emigration or end of follow-up, whichever came first. We censored
participants with another cancer because cancer treatment and
change of life style might change the subsequent risk for development of another cancer. Air pollution exposure was analyzed
as a linear variable in three a-priori specified confounder
models. Model 1 included sex, calendar time (year of enrolment; linear) and age (time axis). Model 2 additionally adjusted
for smoking status (never/former/current), smoking intensity
(g tobacco/day), smoking duration (years), occupation/
employment status (different definitions, see online appendix
pp. 3–13), educational level (low, medium, high), body mass
index (BMI) (linear, kg/m[2]) and hypertension (yes/no) (all
referring to baseline). Model 3 (the main model) further adjusted for area-level socio-economic status. Information on at least
age, sex, calendar time, smoking status, smoking intensity,
smoking duration and BMI was available in all cohorts. We
provide further information on the available variables and their
definition and distribution in each cohort in the online
appendix (pp. 4–13 and Supplementary Table S1). Potential
confounders were based on previous literature on risk factors
for kidney cancer and availability.
We undertook a number of sensitivity analyses for each
cohort, all with confounder model 3. First, we repeated the
analyses after restriction to participants who had lived at the
baseline address throughout the follow-up period, thus reducing misclassification of long-term exposure to air pollution in

this sub-population. Second, we added an indicator of degree
of urbanization. Thirdly, we tested the linear assumption in
the relation between each air pollutant and kidney parenchyma cancer by replacing the linear term with a natural cubic
spline with three equally spaced inner knots, and compared
the model fit of the linear and the spline models by the
likelihood-ratio test. Fourthly, we repeated the analyses using
back-extrapolated NO2 and NOx exposure data, which is
described further in the online appendix (pp. 2–3).
In the meta-analysis, we used random-effects models to
summarize the results for cohorts.[24] I[2] statistics[25] and p-values
for the v[2] test from Cochran’s Q were calculated to determine
heterogeneity among cohort-specific effect estimates. We used
[a common STATA (www.stata.com) script for all analyses.](http://www.stata.com)

Results
Fourteen cohorts in seven European countries contributed to
our study. Altogether 289,002 cohort members contributed
4,111,908 person-years at risk and 697 incident kidney parenchyma cases were registered during follow-up (mean, 14.2
years). The number of participants and cases varied considerably, the Austrian cohorts contributing almost half the cases
(Table 1). The cohort areas represented a wide range of
exposures, with 3–11 times higher mean air pollution concentrations in some Southern than Northern areas (Table 1).
The variation in exposure within study areas was substantial,
as shown previously.[16] The mean age at enrolment varied
from 43 to 57 years (Table 1).
The meta-analyses showed higher summary hazard ratios
(HRs) in association with higher PM concentration, e.g.
HR 5 1.57 (95% CI: 0.81–3.01) per 5 lg/m[3] PM2.5 and


HR 5 1.36 (95% CI: 0.84–2.19) per 10[2][5]m[2][1] PM2.5 absorbance
(soot), albeit never statistically significant (Table 2). The HRs
in association with nitrogen oxides and traffic were slightly
above one. Adjustment did not affect the summary HRs much
(Table 2). The summary HRs for PM10, PM coarse and PM2.5
were based on low to moderate heterogeneity between cohortspecific results; all p-values for heterogeneity were �0.10 (Table
2). For the large VHM&PP cohort, HRs in association with

PM2.5 and PM2.5 absorbance were lower than one (PM2.5
HR 5 0.73; 95% CI: 0.47–1.14); all other cohorts showed
increased risk in association with PM2.5 exposure (Fig. 2 and
online Supplementary Fig. S1). Analyses based on participants
who did not change residence during follow-up showed stronger associations, but none was statistically significant (Table 3).
These results were based on stronger heterogeneity, which were
statistically significant for PM2.5 and PM10 (p �0.01) (Table 3).
The assumption of linearity was not violated (online Supplementary Table S2). Adjustment for degree of urbanization
did not affect the results much (online Supplementary Table
S3) and use of back-extrapolated NO2 and NOx data only
affected the results marginally (online appendix, pp. 2–3 and
Supplementary Table S4).
Explorative analyses of 8 PM elements in two particle fractions (PM10 and PM2.5) showed mostly elevated HRs. HRs
were elevated in both particle fractions for Cu, Fe, Zn, V and
Si. With the exception of an HR of 2.17 (95% CI: 1.19–3.97)
per 100 ng/m[3] vanadium in PM10, none of the HRs were statistically significant (online Supplementary Table S5). Restriction to cohort participants who lived at the same residence
during follow-up provided mostly higher HRs for the PM
elements (online Supplementary Table S5).

participants who did not change residence during follow-up
showed stronger associations, but none was statistically significant.
Our study benefited from a large number of cohort participants from general populations with widely different levels
of air pollution and complete follow-up. The strengths of our
study also include the use of standardized methods for exposure assessment and data analyses across all cohorts. We
adjusted the analyses for a number of potential confounders.
In particular, all cohort-specific analyses were adjusted for
the important smoking variables smoking status, smoking
intensity and smoking duration, but the possibility of residual
confounding cannot be excluded. We assessed a comprehensive set of pollutants at address-level and the individual exposure assessment was based on actual measurements made in
the development of LUR models for the detection of withinarea contrasts. Since pooling of data across all cohorts was
not possible we could not take full advantage of the exposure
contrasts across Europe.
In our study, the HRs for kidney parenchyma cancer were
actually larger than those reported in the ESCAPE study for
lung cancer, which were 1.22 (1.03, 1.45), 1.18 (0.96, 1.46) and
1.12 (0.88, 1.42) for PM10, PM2.5 and PM2.5 absorbance.[16] The
confidence intervals of the HRs for kidney parenchyma cancer
were wider, however, which is likely due to the smaller number
of cases (697 kidney parenchyma vs. 2095 lung cancer cases);
the person time under risk was virtually the same. A previous
study found an increased HR for kidney cancer in association
with NOx at the residence,[12] which was not found in our study.
Our finding of non-significantly elevated HRs could be affected
by a combination of the number of cancer cases, misclassification of exposure, confounding and chance. Several factors may


have contributed to misclassification of the exposure. Although
our LUR models performed well, with leave-one-out-crossvalidation r[2] values typically between 0.6 and 0.8,[16] any model
incorporates some degree of misclassification. Also, we used
data on air pollution for 2008–2011 in developing our LUR
models but applied them to baseline addresses mainly 10–15
years earlier. Recent research in Rome, the Netherlands and
Vancouver has shown that the spatial distribution of air pollution is relatively stable over 10–year periods,[26–28] a study
showed high correlations between traffic intensities on Dutch
streets over a 10-year period[29] and spatial models for black
smoke in the United Kingdom provided reasonable predictions
even going back to the 1960s,[30] indicating that more recent estimations reflect also historical exposure contrasts. In our study,
exposure was assessed at the enrolment address; moving from
that address during follow-up might lead to misclassification of
the exposure relevant to later development of cancer. Our
results show stronger associations between air pollution and
the risk for kidney parenchyma cancer among people who lived
at the same address throughout follow-up, which would be
expected if air pollution truly causes kidney parenchyma cancer. Altogether, we would expect the exposure misclassification
in our study to be non-differential and consequently not to create artificial associations but rather to influence the HRs
towards unity. The previously reported associations between
air pollution and all-cause mortality[17] and lung cancer[16] using
the same exposure assessment method as in our study indicates
that the method indeed detects effects of exposure contrasts.
The airways are the primary target organs for inhaled particles but evidence from experimental studies with animals
shows that ultrafine particles can translocate to other organs,

such as the liver, kidneys, heart and brain.[13,31–33] Although the
amount of particles accumulating in secondary target organs,
such as the kidney, is many times lower than the lung tissue
dose, it may be relevant for carcinogenic processes.[34,35] Experimental evidence supports that diesel particles induce cancerrelevant processes in the kidneys: diesel exhaust particles induced
oxidative stress in cultured human kidney cells[14] and exacerbated renal oxidative stress, inflammation and DNA damage in
mice.[15] We are aware of no previous studies on outdoor PM air
pollution and kidney cancer in general populations.
The explorative analyses of 8 PM elements showed mostly
non-significantly elevated HRs for copper, iron, zinc, vanadium and silicon for both particle fractions. The vanadium
content of PM2.5 was significantly associated with risk for kidney parenchyma cancer, with substantially elevated HRs in
both PM10 and PM2.5. This may point to a specific source of
particles. However, we do not want to over-interpret the
vanadium findings as one significant association is close to
what would be expected by chance among the 16 tests undertaken for the PM element analyses, given our 5% significance
level. Each PM element can be considered as representing
different air pollution sources with copper, iron and zinc
being indicators mainly of non-tailpipe traffic emissions such
as brake and tire wear, sulfur mainly indicating long-range
transport, nickel and vanadium indicating mixed oil-burning
and industry, silicon crustal material and potassium biomass
burning.[22,36–38]

The Austrian VHM&PP cohort was the only cohort where

PM2.5 and PM2.5 absorbance (soot) was not associated with
higher risk for kidney parenchyma cancer (Fig. 2 and online
Supplementary Fig. S1). This large cohort influenced the summary HRs substantially: without the VHM&PP cohort, the
summary HR was 1.95 (1.21, 3.14) for PM2.5. We cannot explain
the opposite results with any bias or design issue related to specifically this cohort; chance might be the explanation. The latter
interpretation is supported by the fact that in the lung cancer
and all-cause mortality ESCAPE analyses, elevated HRs were
found for this cohort, that did not affect the summary HRs.[16,17]

A post-hoc explanation could be that the concentrations of
vanadium were lowest in this cohort, while vanadium was associated with the highest HRs among the analyzed PM elements.
In conclusion, our study provides suggestive evidence that
exposure to outdoor PM at the residence may be associated
with higher risk for kidney parenchyma cancer. The result
should be interpreted with caution and future studies are
needed to confirm or reject this hypothesis.
