**Abstract: Particulate matter (PM) air pollution has challenged the global community and the Interna-**
tional Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified airborne particulate matter as carcinogenic
to humans. However, while most studies of cancer examined a single cancer type using different
cohorts, few studies compared the associations of PM between different cancer types. We aimed
to compare the association of long-term exposure to PM (PM10 and PM2.5) and cancer mortality
across 17 different types of cancer using a population-based cohort in the Seoul Metropolitan Area
(SMA), South Korea; Our study population includes 87,608 subjects (mean age: 46.58 years) residing
in the SMA from the National Health Insurance Services–National Sample cohort (NHIS–NSC) and
followed up for 2007–2015. We used the time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model to estimate
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of each cancer mortality per 10 µg/m[3]

increase in PM concentrations, after adjusting for individual and areal characteristics. During eight
years of follow-up, 1487 people died with any of 17 cancer types. Lung cancer death was the highest,
followed by liver and stomach cancer. Although we did not find the association for all cancer types,
possibly because of limited cancer cases, HRs of PM2.5 were relatively high for lung, stomach, pancreas, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prostate, esophagus, oral and pharynx, and brain cancer mortality
(HRs = 1.44–7.14). High HRs for pancreas, non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma, esophagus, and oral and
pharynx cancer were also seen for PM10; our findings suggest PM air pollution as a potential risk
factor of cancer mortality for upper digestive tracts, mouth, pancreas, and non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma
in a highly urbanized population with high exposure to PM for a long time.

**1. Introduction**

Cancer remains one of the major burdens of disease worldwide. In 2016, the World
Health Organization reported that about 70% of all deaths are attributed to non-communicable
diseases, in which cancer makes up more than 20% [1]. Despite the overall decrease in
cancer deaths, owing to early cancer detection and management, the burden of cancer
mortality persists, with constant global increase in cancer incidence. For example, the newly
diagnosed cancer cases are expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, approximately a 50%
rise from 2020 [2]. Lung cancer, as the most common cause of cancer death, makes up 18.0%
of 9.9 million deaths for the global population, followed by colorectum (9.4%) and liver
cancer (8.3%) in 2020 [2]. In order to reduce the heavy burden of cancer, efforts have been
devoted to identifying risk factors of cancer. In addition to genetic predisposition, studies

reported modifiable behaviors such as smoking, drinking, diet, and physical activity, and
recently drew attention to environmental factors [1].
As a prominent environmental risk factor, particulate matter (PM) air pollution has
challenged the global community. Many epidemiological and toxicological studies suggested evidence of the causal relationship between long–term exposure to PM and lung
cancer incidence and mortality [3]. Owing to cumulative evidence, the International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified airborne particulate matter as carcinogenic to
humans [4]. Most recently, new findings supported the associations with mortality of
other cancer types: stomach, colorectal, liver, pancreatic, breast, and bladder cancer [5–12].
However, it is difficult to compare the associations of PM between different cancer types,
because most studies examined single cancer types based on different cohorts. Characteristics of cancer and the association with PM may vary depending on the population
related to genetic and environmental factors. Furthermore, only a few cohort studies that
compared many cancer types were performed, mostly in limited regions of North America
and Europe, primarily with low-dose conditions of PM. Findings from low–dose countries
may or may not be consistent, when investigated in high-dose conditions.
A population-based cohort in South Korea can provide an opportunity to fill this
research gap. The National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS–NSC)
is a nationwide cohort that makes up of 2.2% of the South Korean population and includes
various information from medical utilization and health examination [13]. In South Korea,
cancer is the most common cause of death, accounting for 27.5% of the total death [14].
This is greater than the global figure and expected to increase along with population aging
and westernized lifestyle [15]. This large portion of cancer deaths can also help elucidate
the role of PM air pollution as a risk factor of the various types of cancer. Our previous
study used this cohort and found suggestive evidence of the association between PM and
lung cancer incidence in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), where about half of the South
Korean population resides [16]. Using the population-based nationwide cohort, this study
aims to compare the associations of long-term exposure to PM ≤2.5 or 10 µm in diameter
(PM2.5 or PM10) with cancer mortality by 17 cancer types in the SMA.

**2. Materials and Methods**
_2.1. Study Population_

Our study population includes 87,608 subjects selected from the NHIS–NSC. Since
South Korea accomplished universal healthcare coverage for all citizens in 2000, the NHIS
database has been expanded by containing enormous amounts of information on healthcare
utilization and biological and sociodemographic characteristics for the entire population.
In 2014, the NHIS created the NHIS–NSC, which includes one million people sampled
from the NHIS database and their various individual information for 2002–2015 [13]. We
primarily focused on the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), where our previous study found
the association between PM and lung cancer incidence [16]. The SMA is a highly urbanized
and populated area with relatively high air pollution (48 and 26 µg/m[3] for annual average
concentration of PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, in 2015), consisting of three regions, namely,
Seoul, the capital of South Korea (area = 605 km[2]; population = 10,192,710), Gyeonggi, the
most populated province (10,184 km[2]; 11,106,211), and Incheon, the second largest port city
(1007 km[2]; 2,664,576) (Figure 1 and Figure S1, see the supplementary file) [17]. A relatively
homogenous people, as half of the South Korean population live in the SMA, can help
achieve the representativeness of our findings and avoid the difficulty in accounting for the
exceptionally heterogeneous subpopulation found in our previous studies [16,18].
From one million people of the NHIS–NSC, we applied our exclusion criteria and
selected 87,608 subjects as our study population (Figure S2). To assess the impact of longterm exposure to PM on cancer mortality, we determined the year 2007 as our baseline
and employed the exposure period of 5 years. Specifically, we selected study subjects who
participated in a health screening covered by the National Health Insurance in 2005–2007,
and we followed up their status of cancer death from 2007 to 2015. We restricted our study

population to health screenees in order to utilize their various individual characteristics,
including biological information, health behavior, and medical history. We additionally
excluded those who were younger than the age of 30 or severely disabled, and had no
information on cause of death, residential address, or individual characteristics. We did
not exclude those who were diagnosed with cancer before the baseline, from 2002 to 2006
(10.44% of the study population), to retain the minimum sample size to investigate each
cancer site.

_2.2. Cancer Mortality and Individual and Areal Characteristics_

We identified 17 specific types of cancer mortality based on the International Classification of Disease, 10th reversion (ICD–10): oral and pharynx (C01–C14), esophagus (C15),
stomach (C16), colorectal (C18–C21), liver (C22), gallbladder (C23–C24), pancreas (C25),
lung (C34), breast (C50), female genitals (C53–C56), prostate (C61), bladder (C67), kidney
(C64–66, C68), brain (C71), non-Hodgkin’s (C82–C85), multiple myeloma (C88, C90), and
leukemia (C91–C95). We chose these 17 sites, which were investigated in previous studies
that compared different cancer sites [6,9] and provided at least 20 cancer deaths in our
study population.
For individual-level characteristics, we included age, sex, health insurance premium
(0–40%, 40–60%, 60–80%, or 80–100%), employee status, smoking status (never, former or
current smoker), smoking period (year), smoking amount (pack per day), frequency of
alcohol consumption and physical activity, diet (plant–based, balanced, or meat–based diet),
BMI, and family history of any cancer. A health insurance premium is computed based
primarily on income and property/asset, regardless of age and health status, and was often
used as an indicator for socioeconomic status in previous studies, South Korea [16,18,19].
For area–level characteristics, we used district–specific characteristics for demographics,
socioeconomic status, health care access, and area type. Six area-level characteristics
represent socioeconomic characteristics and health care accessibility. Demography–related
characteristics such as the proportion of the elderly and population density were also often
used as indicators of area-level socioeconomic status in South Korea, based on high poverty
rate and low economic activity of the elderly population and low population density
correlated with large elderly population [20–22]. Gross regional domestic product (GRDP)
is estimated based on production, distribution, and expenditure of income of each district,
indicating local economic activity [23]. We used the proportion of health screening program
recipients to represent health care accessibility. Using the district-specific characteristics
obtained from the year 2005 Census and general national statistics in 2005, we categorized
the elderly population (≥65 years), high school graduates, population size, and gross


-----

regional domestic production to the quartiles across districts. We obtained health screening
program recipients for each district from the National Health Insurance Statistic in 2008
and computed the rate of recipients. The area types defined as urban, suburban and rural
areas were obtained from the Korea Statistics.

_2.3. Exposure Assessment_

We estimated individual–level long–term concentrations of PM using two previously
developed prediction models. For PM10, we used the national–scale exposure prediction
model developed in a universal kriging framework along with more than 300 geographical
variables and air pollution regulatory monitoring data [24]. This point–wise spatial model
allowed us to predict annual–average concentrations of PM10 at any location in South
Korea. As address information of NHIS-NSC subjects is available at the district level for
maintaining confidentiality, we predicted annual-average PM10 concentrations at all census
tract centroids and averaged to each district to compute population-representative district
averages. Each Metropolitan City or Province includes 5–48 districts with a total of 251–263
districts for 2002–2015 (average and range of area size in 2007 for South Korea: 429 and
3–1818 km[2]; SMA: 149 and 7–878 km[2]). For PM2.5, we applied the ratio-based model
because nationwide PM2.5 regulatory monitoring data are available only after 2015, as
opposed to PM10, which is available from 2001 [25]. This model provided district-level
PM2.5 annual-average concentrations based on the ratios of PM2.5 to PM10 multiplied by
district–level PM10 predictions. As PM2.5 monitoring data are available for 2001–2015
in Seoul, we computed ratios each year for 2001–2015 in Seoul and adjusted regional
differences of ratios using the proportions of ratios in Seoul to those in other regions in 2015.
Since accumulating evidence has showed stronger associations of various health endpoints
with PM2.5 than with PM10, and since our prediction approach for PM2.5 based on ratios
showed good model performance [26], we treated the PM2.5 analysis as our primary. Finally,
we computed the averages of district-level PM10 or PM2.5 concentrations for each of the
previous 5 years over the follow–up period as individual–level long–term exposure to
PM. In addition, we computed 1– and 3–year average concentrations for our sensitivity
analyses.

_2.4. Statistical Analysis_

We used the time-dependent Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of cancer mortality per 10 µg/m[3]

increase in PM concentrations, according to each of 17 cancer types. Time–dependent Cox
regression allows us to assess the overall risk estimate by combining the survival pattern
associated with exposure within each time window of one year for the entire follow-up
period as a weighted average of estimates across time windows [27]. The survival time of
each participant was calculated from the baseline, 1 January 2007, to the earliest date of the
end of the study, 31 December 2015, death, and drop-out. Participants who were lost to
follow up, alive at the end of study, or died with other causes were treated censored.
We developed three progressively–adjusted health analysis models to investigate
the association between long-term exposure to PM and cancer mortality according to the
progressive adjustment of potential confounders. Model 1 included age and sex in addition
to PM. In model 2, we added individual-level characteristics. These characteristics were
commonly included as confounders in previous cohort studies of long-term air pollution
and mortality [28,29]. In model 3, we additionally adjusted for area-level characteristics to
account for possible area-level confounding, in addition to individual-level confounding,
suggested in our previous studies of PM and mortality in South Korea [16,18,30]. Since
the SMA has relatively similar area-level characteristics, we chose model 2 as our primary
approach. For our sensitivity analysis, we used 1- and 3-year average concentrations of PM
and compared to our primary analysis using average exposure for the previous 5 years.
Second, we performed the same analyses using the 206,717 NHIS–NSC subjects for South
Korea and compared to our findings for the SMA. Third, we defined cancer deaths based


-----

on single-site cancers and compared those to our primary findings, including both single–
and multiple–site cancers. Lastly, we excluded those who were diagnosed with cancer
before the baseline and compared this to our primary analysis findings.
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National Cancer
Center (IRB code NCC2018–0017).

**3. Results**
_3.1. Study Population and Individual Characteristics_

In 87,608 NHIS–NSC subjects living in the SMA, most participants were middle-aged
adults (46.58 years old on average) and more than half of participants had never smoked
(67.43%), never or rarely consumed alcohol (54.73%), did not exercise (50.60%), and lived in
urban areas (84.46%) (Table 1). People who died with any cancer during the eight years
of follow-up for 2007–2015 were likely to be older (58.60 years old), former or current
smokers (40.75%) with longer cigarette smoking period for ≥30 years (21.75%), and alcohol
consumers drinking almost every day (6.78%) at baseline, compared to those who survived
to the end of the study, were lost, or died with other causes (46.36 years old, 32.42%, 5.71%,
and 3.05%, respectively). These patterns in the total SMA population and subpopulations
by cancer death status were similar for 206,717 people in the entire country (Table S1).

_3.2. Study Population and Cancer Mortality_

For eight years of follow-up in our study, from 2007 to 2015, 1563 people (782,090
person years; 1.78%) died with any cancer in 87,608 NHIS–NSC SMA subjects, while 1487
died with any of 17 cancer types. According to the cancer site, lung cancer gave the highest
deaths (23.50%), followed by liver cancer (13.57%) and stomach cancer (12.68%) (Table 2).
This pattern was similar in 206,717 subjects over South Korea (24.81, 14.93, and 12.50%,
respectively) (Table S2).

highest mean ages (48.95 and 64.39 years old, respectively). Males are more likely to die with
all types of cancer than females, except only for brain cancer (41.67%). In particular, more
than 90% of esophagus and oral and pharynx cancer deaths occurred in males. Additionally,
people in the lowest 25% for health insurance premiums tended to die more with lung,
stomach, colorectal, kidney, and bladder cancer (>30%), while people in the highest 25%
for health insurance premiums showed higher mortality with liver, pancreas, gallbladder,
prostate, and esophagus cancer (>30%). Lastly, a higher percent of ever smokers was found
in lung, prostate, esophagus, and oral and pharynx cancer mortality (>50%). Such trends
are mostly similar in South Korea with a few exceptions (Table S2). For example, oral
and pharynx cancer showed different patterns between low and high health insurance
premiums in the SMA (8.00% and 24.00%), but there was greater similarity in the South
Korean population (21.21 and 22.73%).

_3.3. Association between Long-Term PM Exposure and Cancer Mortality_

Figure 2 shows HRs and 95% CIs of cause-specific cancer mortality for a 10µg/m[3]

increase in PM2.5 or PM10 concentrations for the previous five years in the SMA population.
Although both PM2.5 and PM10 showed HRs close to 1 for all cancer mortality (HR = 1.16,
95% CI = 0.79–1.69), HRs somewhat varied across 17 cancer types (Table S3). For PM2.5, lung
cancer showed a positive estimate (HR = 1.55, 95% CI = 0.73–3.26). HRs were particularly
high for stomach, pancreas, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, prostate, esophagus, oral and
pharynx, and brain cancer mortality (HRs = 1.44–7.14 for non-Hodgkin’s to oral and
pharynx cancer mortality). These patterns were mostly similar for PM10, with some
exceptions of negative estimates for stomach and prostate cancer. Nonetheless, effect
estimates of all 17 cancer types were statistically non-significant, mainly due to small
numbers of cancer deaths.

Our sensitivity analysis for the entire country showed similarities and differences from
those for the SMA (Figure S3 and Tables S5 and S6). Stomach, prostate, non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, esophagus, and brain cancer that showed higher HRs of PM2.5 compared to
other cancer types in the SMA also showed positive and higher estimates (HRs = 1.12–1.87)
(Table S5). Different from the SMA, in South Korea, leukemia showed the highest estimate
(HR = 2.39, 95% CI = 0.84–7.37), whereas lung cancer gave a negative estimate (HR = 0.82,
95% CI = 0.63–1.08). None of these estimates were statistically significant.
Our sensitivity analyses, using PM2.5 for the previous 1 or 3 years, generally showed
consistent results with those of the main analysis using 5 years of exposure in the SMA.
HRs were positive for lung (1.68 and 1.62, 1 year and 3 year HRs, respectively), stomach
(1.43 and 1.92), pancreas (2.47 and 3.60), prostate (2.73 and 3.57), esophagus (3.02 and 2.87),
and oral and pharynx (8.14 and 5.31) cancer mortality (Table S3). However, gallbladder,
female genital, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, and brain cancer mortality showed
the different patterns across shorter and longer exposure periods of averaging. The analysis
using single–site definition for cancer mortality also showed consistent results with those
of the main analysis, including single– and multiple–site cancers (Table S7). Exclusion of
those who were diagnosed with cancer before the baseline also showed generally consistent
results with our primary findings (Table S8).

**4. Discussion**

Using a population-based well-established cohort, we focused on 17 different types
of cancer and compared the associations of cancer mortality with long–term exposure to
PM in a highly urbanized population exposed to a relatively high level of PM air pollution.
Although we did not find statistical significance for the association across all cancer types
possibly resulting from the limited cancer cases, our findings suggest potentially higher
mortality risk of PM2.5 in lung, stomach, pancreas, prostate, non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
esophagus, oral and pharynx, and brain cancer compared to other cancer types. The
suggestive high risks of pancreas, Non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma, esophagus, and oral and
pharynx cancer were consistent for PM10.
This study adds an important understanding of the variation in the association of
PM and cancer mortality across different cancer sites under a high-dose environment of
PM. Most previous cohort studies of PM have focused on lung cancer [3]. Although the
mutagenic, epigenetic, and inflammatory mechanisms are shared largely with all types of
cancer, it is only recently that large cohort studies have begun to expand to other cancer
types [27,31–37]. Furthermore, there have only been a few studies that compared the
associations across different types of cancer and identified the specific sites more affected
by PM air pollution than others. The findings of these studies are still too inconsistent to
provide evidence of the difference in the association [3]. To our knowledge, at least three
studies paid attention to different cancer types and investigated PM as a risk factor of
mortality in a generally healthy population: two studies in the U.S. and one in Hong Kong.
The lack of evidence could possibly result from the unavailability of representative and
sufficient cancer data for different sites. Our study aimed to fill in this research gap, using
a representative population exposed to a high-dose of PM from a population-based cohort,
constructed from the national health insurance database, taking advantage of a universal
health care system.
Previous studies that compared the associations of PM and cancer mortality across
various cancer types showed inconsistent findings, possibly derived by different environmental and/or population characteristics. Two nationwide studies in the U.S. examined 22
cancer sites in 635,539 subjects (18–84 years) of the Public National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) for 1987–2014 and 29 cancer sites in 623,048 adults (≥30 years) of the American
Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (ACS–CPS II) cohort for 1982–2004 [6,9]. Both
studies found the associations of PM2.5 with colorectal cancer, and reported largely positive
but non–significant HRs for cancers of the esophagus and female genitals (Table 3). Some
differences were also found. The ACS–CPS II study reported the association with kidney


-----

_Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3180_ 9 of 13

cancer which showed a non-significantly negative estimate in the NHIS cohort. The association was found for mouth, stomach, breast, female genital, non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
and leukemia in the NHIS study but not in the ACS–CPS II study. These differences could
be related to different population characteristics and study period. The NHIS population
of 635,539 subjects were young and old adults aged 18–84 years, living in the continental
U.S. including suburban and rural areas in addition to urban areas, and participated from
late 1980s through 2010s. In contrast, the ACS–CPS II population of 623,048 subjects were
adults over 30 years, mostly from urban areas, followed up from the 1980s through to the
early 2000s. The other comparison study, performed in Hong Kong with a much higher
level of PM2.5 (33.7 µg/m[3] compared to 10.7 and 12.6 µg/m[3] in two U.S. studies), and an
older population, aged ≥ 65, also showed differences in their findings. This cohort of 66,820
people showed the associations with cancers of breast and upper digestive tracts including
esophagus and stomach, and digestive accessary organs including liver, gall bladder, and
pancreas (Table 3). Their high effect estimates for upper digestive tracts are also seen in our
study as another Asian population, whereas their findings for breast and female genital
cancers are not replicated in our study. Our findings are even more different from the
findings of two U.S. studies. Except esophagus cancer, which consistently showed higher
effect estimates, all the other cancers of the breast, female genitals, and bladder found
associated in the U.S. studies showed no associations with HRs close to 1 in our study. In
addition to the differences in pollution sources, physical environments, and population,
another possible explanation for this inconsistency could be the much smaller sample size
compared to the two U.S. studies.

Our findings of suggestive risk of stomach, pancreas, and oral and pharynx cancer
mortality for exposure to long–term PM2.5 was also found in some previous cohort studies
that investigated mortality or incidence of single cancer types (Figure S4). A study of 400,000
adults in Taiwan reported the association of PM2.5 and stomach cancer mortality [33], while


-----

_Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 3180_ 10 of 13

a European cohort study of 305,551 adults in 10 countries showed the association with
incidence of stomach cancer [34]. A U.S. cohort study based on a multi-ethnic population
in the Los Angeles area reported the association with incidence of pancreas cancer [38].
We did not find any studies that reported the association with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
which showed a high HR in our study. As the incidence of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma has
recently increased in many countries including South Korea [39], our finding provides a
motivation to explore new cancer types. Different from our findings, increasing numbers
of individual cohort studies examined bladder, kidney, breast, and brain cancers and found
the associations. While recent review studies of breast and brain cancers concluded that
the evidence still remains inconsistent [40,41], review studies of bladder and kidney cancer
concluded relatively consistent evidence [42,43]. Future studies should include extended
populations to investigate these cancers with relatively low incidence and mortality.
In our study, all of our estimates were statistically non-significant possibly because
of small cancer cases. Although we relied on a population-based cohort, one million
cohort is still hampered by limited power when we applied our conservative inclusion
criteria and pruned to about 90,000 people as our study population. To address the issue of
low power, we performed a sensitivity analysis by extending the study population to the
entire country. However, this nationwide analysis also gave mostly non-significant effect
estimates. These uncertain and less stable effect estimates may be derived by the heavily
diverse population from different regions according to socioeconomic characteristics or
environmental factors, which were not sufficiently adjusted by area-level variables included
in our analyses. Future studies can include further extended populations fully leveraging
the national health insurance database. In addition, investigation of cancer incidence could
have improved the lack of power. However, we focused on cancer mortality in our study
to avoid potential outcome measurement errors in incidence and the impact of different
degree of error across different cancer types on the comparison. Future studies should
expand the comparison across cancer sites to cancer incidence. Lastly, we did not account
for multiple comparison of 17 cancer types, because our findings gave large uncertainty
derived by small cases. Future research using extended populations should apply multiple
comparison correction.
Our study includes some limitations to provide topics for future research. Our study
used district-level PM concentrations as individual exposure based on limited address
availability. In addition, we relied on exposure to outdoor PM and did not take into account
indoor and/or personal exposure. These limitations may lead to exposure measurement
errors that affect accuracy and/or precision in subsequent health effect analyses [43,44].
Although infiltration of PM is higher compared to gaseous pollutants [45,46], indicating
the small impact of measurement errors when outdoor PM is used, emerging new technology such as portable sensors can help assess indoor PM of cancer patients [46]. Future
studies should improve exposure assessment by using detailed address information and
incorporating indoor and personal exposure. In addition, we obtained all individual–level
and area-level variables at baseline to maximize the sample size, but some of these characteristics such as BMI could vary over time. Further studies should apply time-varying
information and confirm our findings. Lastly, we did not exclude cancer patients, comprising 10% of our population, in order to attain sufficient sample sizes to investigate the
association by 17 different cancer sites. This inclusion would make it difficult to distinguish
between the impact of PM on cancer occurrence and its impact on progression, although
our sensitivity analysis showed generally consistent findings with our primary results
including patients. Differences in severity and induction period depending on the cancer
type could make this impact even more complicated. Future studies should clarify this
impact in extended populations.

**5. Conclusions**

Although our study did not find associations, findings suggested PM air pollution as a
potential risk factor of deaths for pancreas, non–Hodgkin’s lymphoma, esophagus, and oral


-----

and pharynx cancer other than lung cancer in an urban population exposed to high levels
of PM air pollution. Further studies need to investigate the difference in the association by
cancer types using extended populations and refined exposure measurement.
