Background: Diesel exhaust contains large numbers of ultrafine particles (UFPs, < 0.1 µm) and is a recognized
human carcinogen. However, epidemiological studies have yet to evaluate the relationship between UFPs and
cancer incidence.
Methods: We conducted a case-control study of UFPs and incident prostate cancer in Montreal, Canada. Cases
were identified from all main Francophone hospitals in the Montreal area between 2005 and 2009. Population
controls were identified from provincial electoral lists of French Montreal residents and frequency-matched to
cases using 5-year age groups. UFP exposures were estimated using a land use regression model. Exposures were
assigned to residential locations at the time of diagnosis/recruitment as well as approximately 10-years earlier to
consider potential latency between exposure and disease onset. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI) were calculated per interquartile range (IQR) increase in UFPs (approximately 4000 particles/cm[3])
using logistic regression models adjusting for individual-level and ecological covariates.
Results: Ambient UFP concentrations were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.10, 95%
CI: 1.01, 1.19) in fully adjusted models when exposures were assigned to residences 10-years prior to diagnosis.
This risk estimate increased slightly (OR=1.17, 95% CI; 1.01, 1.35) when modeled as a non-linear natural spline
function. A smaller increased risk (OR=1.04, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.11) was observed when exposures were assigned
to residences at the time of diagnosis.
Conclusions: Exposure to ambient UFPs may increase the risk of prostate cancer. Future studies are needed to
replicate this finding as this is the first study to evaluate this relationship.


Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence in men
worldwide, with an estimated 1.4 million new cases annually (Global
Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration, 2015). Age, family history, and
race are the only recognized risk factors for this cancer (International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 2014), as well as specific
genetic determinants which explain a small portion of familial risk


(Eeles et al., 2014). The environment is suspected to play a role, as
geographic variations in disease occurrence have been observed
(Klassen and Platz, 2006). Exposure to environmental chemicals may
explain some of these patterns. For example, pesticides, arsenic,
cadmium, diesel engine emissions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons have been associated with increased risks of prostate cancer
(Aronson et al., 1996; Rybicki, 2006; Koutros, 2013; Cogliano et al.,
2011), as have occupations potentially entailing chemical exposures

(Parent, 2001; Doolan, 2014; Sauvé, 2016). However, other studies
have failed to observe associations between occupational exposures to
diesel exhaust and prostate cancer (Boers et al., 2005).
More recently, three epidemiological studies examined the association between traffic-related air pollution and prostate cancer incidence.
Raaschou-Nielsen et al. (2011) modeled concentrations of nitrogen
oxides and the amount of traffic at the residence of participants as
indicators of traffic-related air pollution, and reported no association
with the incidence of prostate cancer. In contrast, Cohen et al. (2017)
noted that exposure to traffic-related air pollution (measured as nitric
oxide) was associated with an increased risk of lung, bladder, kidney,
and prostate cancer (analyzed as a combined group of cancers) among
men in Israel. In Canada, we reported an increased risk of incident
prostate cancer with increased exposure to nitrogen dioxide around the
residence (Parent et al., 2013).
In this study, we determined the relationship between concentrations of ambient ultrafine particles (UFPs, < 0.1 µm in diameter) and
incident prostate cancer in Montreal, Canada. In Canadian metropolitan
areas, diesel vehicles are a major source of ambient UFPs (Weichenthal
et al., 2015); therefore, spatial differences in UFP concentrations may
provide important information on population exposures to diesel
exhaust. This is an important point as IARC classifies both diesel engine
exhaust (Benbrahim-Tallaa et al., 2012) and outdoor air pollution
(Loomis et al., 2013) as Group 1 carcinogens (i.e., carcinogenic to
humans); thus, exposure surfaces of outdoor UFP concentrations may
provide a useful means of evaluating the long-term health effects of
diesel emissions on a population-level.


2. Methods

2.1. Study design

We conducted a population-based case-control study of incident
prostate cancer during the years 2005–2009 (referred to as Prostate
Cancer and Environment Study; PROtEuS) as described previously
(Parent et al., 2013; Blanc-Lapierre, 2015). Briefly, cases included
1933 men (under 76 years of age) identified across the main Francophone hospitals that diagnose prostate cancer in the greater Montreal
area (Montreal Island as well as the North and South Shores). Cases
were all patients newly diagnosed with primary prostate cancer,
actively ascertained through pathology departments across Frenchspeaking hospitals in the Montreal area between September 2005 and
December 2009. According to the Quebec Cancer Registry, these
hospitals covered over 80% of all prostate cancer cases diagnosed in
the Montreal region during the study period. A total of 1994 population
controls were selected concurrently from the continually updated
population-based provincial electoral lists of French-speaking residents
of Montreal, and controls were frequency-matched to cases by 5-year
age groups. Controls with a history of prostate cancer were excluded.
This resulted in an approximate 1:1 case to control ratio. Response rates
were 79% for cases and 57% for controls.
In Montreal, citizens have free access to healthcare including
prostate cancer screening. At the time of study, prostate cancer
screening occurred for most subjects on a yearly basis and information
was available on screening practices. We do not have information on

race for non-participants although most of our sample was of European
descent; there were marginal differences in SES indicators between
participants and non-participants. The study was approved by the
institutional review board of the Institut National de la Recherche
Scientifique, along with the ethics committees from the following
hospitals: Hôpital Notre-Dame, Hôpital St-Luc, Hôtel-Dieu de
Montréal, Hôpital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Hôpital Jean-Talon,
Hôpital Charles-Lemoyne, Hôpital de Fleury, Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur
de Montréal, Hôpital Santa Cabrini.
Residential addresses at the time of diagnosis for cases were
extracted from hospital records; those of controls were obtained from
electoral lists at the time of recruitment. Lifetime residential addresses
were elicited through follow-up telephone interviews and geocoded
with the ArcGIS geographic information system (GIS, ESRI, Redlands,


CA). Home addresses and geographic coordinates at the index date
(diagnosis/interview) were available for all 3927 subjects. Information
on home address in 1996 was collected at re-contact for 2891 (74%)
subjects; 2646 (92%) of these could be geocoded.
To evaluate the potential for selection bias in the study, we
conducted analyses comparing study participants to non-participants
in terms of four ecological variables derived from census tract data in
2006 for the address at recruitment. The percentage of subjects living in
areas with a greater proportion of recent immigrants within the
previous 5 years were 5.2% and 6.0%, for participants and nonparticipants, respectively. Corresponding values were 6.6% and 7.2%
for higher unemployment rate, 19.6% and 20.5% of adults without a
high school diploma, and 22.9% and 25.3% for the lowest quintile of
household income. These observations suggest that there were small
differences between participants and non-participants, with non-participants showing slightly less favourable socio-economic indicators.
Mean UFP exposures were also similar among participant cases
(24,349/cm[3]) and non-participant cases (24,267/cm[3]) as well as
participant controls (24,177/cm[3]) and non-participant controls
(24,196/cm[3]).
Using in-depth, face-to-face interviews, participants provided information on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, prostate cancer screening history, detailed occupational histories, and
residential address at time of diagnosis for cases or time of interview
for controls. In addition, addresses at time of interview were available
for all participants and addresses of 88% of participants were available
in 1996, corresponding to about 10 years prior to recruitment.

2.2. Exposure assessment

A land use regression model (Weichenthal et al., 2016) was used to
estimate ambient concentrations of UFPs at participants’ residences
across the island of Montreal. Briefly, this model was derived from data
collected during a mobile monitoring campaign conducted between
2011 and 2012, and it included information from 414 road segments
across Montreal. Model parameters included variables for park space
(200-meter buffer), open space (100-meter buffer), local roads (100meter buffer), length of rail (100-meter buffer), and annual NOx
emissions (100-meter buffer) as well as parameters for long-term
average temperature and wind speed in Montreal. The R[2] value from
the land-use regression model was 0.62 and the cross-validation R[2] was
0.60. This model was used to assign UFP exposures to geocoded
addresses or centroids of six-character postal codes. A six-character
postal code in urban areas represents a block face or a large apartment
complex. Exposures were assigned to addresses at the time of enrollment as well as to addresses in 1996 (approximately 10-years prior to
enrollment), to account for potential latency between exposure and
disease onset.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) describing the relationship between
interquartile range (IQR) increases in ambient UFP concentrations and
the risk of developing prostate cancer. Three separate models were
developed in the main analyses with UFP exposures assigned to the
recruitment address or the address approximately 10-years prior to
recruitment (65% of subjects had the same address at recruitment and
10-years prior to recruitment). We show the results of three models in
which different covariates were included. Model 1 adjusted only for age
(continuous, linear). Model 2 included additional parameters for
personal covariates including ancestry (European, Black, Asian,
Other), first-degree relative with history of prostate cancer (Yes, No),
highest level of schooling (Elementary, High School, College,
University), annual family income (5 categories), marital status
(Married or Common Law Separated Divorced or Widower Single

physical activity level (Very, Moderately, Not very active), and maximum body mass index during their lifetime (BMI, in kg/m[2]) (as a
natural spline with 2 degrees of freedom). Model 3 included additional
contextual variables from the 2006 (or 1996 for addresses 10-years
prior to recruitment) Canadian Census (within a 1000-meter radius):
percentage of adults who did not complete high school (as a linear
effect), median household income (as a linear effect), percent of recent
immigrants (as a linear effect), and unemployment rate (as a linear
effect). Missing values were included as their own category. Continuous
covariates were modeled as natural cubic spline functions (Cao et al.,
2006), using 2 or 3 degrees of freedom (df), with linear terms used if
there was no evidence of non-linearity. For continuous variables,
missing values resulted in the subject being dropped from the analysis.
As sensitivity analyses we included smoking and alcohol consumption using natural cubic splines instead of as categorical variables and
we also developed models that additionally adjusted for ambient NO2
(natural spline, 2 df) using a land use regression model developed by
Crouse et al. (2010). Further sensitivity analyses were conducted
limiting the control population only to those subjects who were
screened for prostate cancer by prostate specific antigen and/or digital
rectal exam (and tested negative) in the 2-years prior to the interview to
reduce the likelihood of undiagnosed cancers. Finally, we created
separate models for more aggressive cancers (Gleason score > 7, or 7
with primary pattern of 4 and secondary pattern of 3) and less
aggressive cancers (Gleason score < 7, or 7 with primary pattern of 3
and secondary pattern of 4). Statistical interactions were evaluated by
including first-order interaction terms and through stratified analyses.

3. Results

Our analysis included 1240 prostate cases and 1246 controls. As
expected, race and family history of prostate cancer were identified as
independent risk factors for prostate cancer but few of the other
individual-level covariates were associated with the risk of developing
the disease (Table 1). Ambient NO2 concentrations at recruitment
addresses were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer
(Table 1). Ambient concentrations of UFPs varied substantially across
the Island, ranging from approximately 10,000/cm[3] to more than
90,000/cm[3] (Table 2). Mean concentrations of UFPs were similar
among participants and non-participants for both cases (participants:
24,249/cm[3]; non-participants: 24,479/cm[3]) and controls (participants:
24,177/cm[3]; non-participants: 24,196/cm[3]). The Spearman correlation
coefficients between ambient UFPs and NO2 were 0.19 for exposures
assigned to the recruitment address and 0.22 for exposures assigned 10years prior to enrollment


Fig. 1 shows the fully-adjusted (i.e. Model 3) exposure response
functions for concentrations of UFPs evaluated at their residence at
time of interview (Panel A) and approximately 10 years prior to
enrollment (Panel B). Both curves show a j-shaped relationship,
although the 95% CIs were wide at low concentrations (< 20,000/
cm[3]). These somewhat large confidence intervals were a result of
relatively few numbers of cases and controls exposed; e.g., for current
address, the number of cases and controls exposed at concentrations
20,000/cm[3] and less were 92 and 80, respectively (for address 10 years
before interview, 61 cases and 53 controls). For larger values of UFPs,
both response curves were consistent with a linear response between
approximately 25,000 and 60,000 particles/cm[3], and with greater
model uncertainty outside this exposure range.

Table 3 shows the detailed results for UFP exposures assigned at the
time of interview and approximately 10 years prior to enrollment using
the fitted non-linear response function as well as those assuming a
linear relationship throughout the entire range of UFP values. For
exposures assigned at time of interview there was little increase in risk
observed between the 25th and 75th percentiles in non-linear models;
increases in risk of about 3–4% per IQR were observed if a linear
relationship was assumed. Stronger associations were observed for UFP
exposures assigned 10 years before time of interview. Notably, as
suggested by the increase in the response curve shown in Panel B of
Fig. 1, the risks for a change in concentrations of UFPs from the 25th to
the 75th percentiles were much higher than for an assumed linear
relationship. Specifically, the OR from the 25th and 75th percentiles
was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01–1.35) as compared to an OR of 1.10 (95% CI:
1.01–1.19) for the linear model. The lower risks for the linear model are
due to the j-shaped form at lower concentrations and the convex curve
at high concentrations.
We found no evidence of interactions with any of the variables
(results not shown). In sensitivity analyses including additional adjustment for NO2 in the models (over the same time frame as UFPs), UFP
exposures 10-years prior to enrollment remained associated with
prostate cancer (linear model, OR=1.11, 95% CI: 2.0, 22) with a
smaller risk observed for exposures assigned to residences at enrollment
(linear model, OR=1.03, 95% CI: −0.96, 1.10). Similarly, results did
not change when analyses were limited to controls who were screened
for prostate cancer in the 2-years prior to recruitment (results not
shown).
Finally, analyses according to Gleason score classifications suggested stronger associations with less aggressive cancers although
confidence intervals overlapped considerably between low- and highgrade categories. Specifically, each interquartile change in UFP exposures 10-years prior to enrollment was associated with an increased
risk of less aggressive prostate cancers (OR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.23)
whereas a smaller risk was observed for more aggressive cancers
(OR=1.05, 95% CI: 0.93, 1.19).

4. Discussion

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men but
uncertainty remains with respect to environmental exposures that may
impact the likelihood of disease onset. In this population-based casecontrol study in Montreal, Canada, we determined the relationship
between ambient UFPs near participants’ residences and the incidence
of prostate cancer. Our findings suggest that ambient UFP exposures
may contribute to increased prostate cancer incidence. Although the
chronic health effects of UFPs have not been evaluated in many
epidemiological studies, these pollutants are an important component
of diesel exhaust (a known human carcinogen) and thus may contribute
to the development of cancer in exposed populations.
Oxidative stress is one of the primary mechanisms thought to play
an important role in air pollution health effects including carcinogenicity (Li et al., 2003; Khandrika et al., 2009; Reuter et al., 2010;
Weichenthal et al., 2013). Since UFPs are known to reach the systemic
circulation soon after exposure (Nemmar et al., 2002), and increase
systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (Traboulsi et al., 2017), this
may be one mechanisms through which UFPs increase the risk of
prostate cancer. Alternatively, the spatial distribution of UFPs may
serve as a marker for a complex mixture of traffic pollutants including
metals or PAHs which may also increase oxidative stress and cancer risk
(Kooiman et al., 2000; Valko et al., 2006). New assays are currently
available to characterize the oxidative potential of particulate air
pollution (Ayres et al., 2008) and future studies should evaluate if
particle oxidative potential metrics are more strongly associated with
cancer risk than tradition mass or number-based exposure metrics.
The j-shaped response function observed in this study is rather
counter-intuitive in terms of carcinogenic exposures, as one would
expect a monotonically-increasing association. The j-shaped response
function, which was less apparent when evaluated 10 years before
interview, persisted throughout most of our sub-analyses. We had the
opportunity to evaluate whether there could be some selection effects at
low concentrations, as our response rates were not high and there was a
difference in response between cases and controls. As part of the
identification of all subjects, we obtained current addresses of all
possible participants and, thus, we were able to evaluate an unadjusted
response function for UFPs. The fitted curve at time of identification for
all non-participants and participants combined was consistent with
linearity (results not shown) especially at low concentrations. Thus, it is
likely that the true response in this target population is linear and that
the j-shaped part of the curve was an artifact due to sampling or
perhaps residual confounding. Of importance was that concentrations
of UFPs were similar for participants and non-participants among cases
and controls and our comparison of participants and non-participants in
terms of socio-demographic indicators (income, unemployment, education, % of recent immigrants) derived from census data suggested
minimal differences, arguing against selection bias. In addition, known
risk factors (race and family history) were associated with increased
prostate cancer incidence in our population (as expected) and this too
supports the validity of our observations.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to determine the potential
association between UFPs and the incidence of prostate cancer. In the
present study, we observed positive associations between UFPs and
prostate cancer and found that this association was independent of NO2,
suggesting that these two measures of traffic-related air pollution may
capture different aspects of the overall air pollution mixture. Indeed,
outdoor concentrations of UFPs and NO2 estimated using land use
regression models were only weakly correlated (~0.2) and this
correlation is consistent with data previously reported for personal
UFP and NO2 exposures in Montreal (Weichenthal et al., 2014a,
2014b). In Canada, we have repeatedly observed that UFPs are strongly
associated with emissions from diesel vehicles (Weichenthal et al.,
2014b, 2015); therefore, our results may primarily reflect the impact of
diesel emissions on prostate cancer risk More generally our findings


are also consistent with two previous studies that reported positive
associations between traffic-related air pollution (measured as NO or
NO2) and prostate cancer (Parent et al., 2013; Cohen et al., 2017).
Studies of risk factors for prostate cancer typically explore differences by disease aggressiveness. Not only are aggressive cancers of
greater clinical significance, there is also evidence that risk factors or
predictors differ between less and more aggressive cancers (Demoury,
2016). In this study, positive associations between exposure to UFPs
and prostate cancer were observed for both high-grade and low-grade
cancers; point estimates were somewhat higher for the latter but
confidence intervals overlapped.
While this study had several advantages including detailed spatial
scale estimates of ambient UFPs concentrations, past residential history,
and individual-level information on confounding factors it is important
to note several limitations. First, our exposure model for UFPs was
developed in 2011–2012 and thus reflects spatial patterns in ambient
UFP concentrations slightly after the identification of incident cases/
controls. As spatial patterns in ambient UFP concentrations depend
largely on patterns of diesel traffic (which tend to be concentrated on
major roadways), spatial differences over time have likely remained
stable. However, overall air pollution concentrations have decreased
over time and thus our estimated UFP concentrations likely underestimate absolute exposure levels in the past owing to improvements in
vehicle efficiency and emissions regulations. In addition, our exposure
model did not account for other combustion sources of air pollution
(e.g. residential wood burning) and thus non-differential exposure
measurement error almost certainly had an impact on our results. In
addition, since UFP exposures where assigned to residential locations
we do not have information on exposures away from the home. This is
an important consideration as UFP have high spatial variability and this
measurement error likely biased our risk estimates toward the null.
Future studies should aim to capture additional combustion sources of
air pollution and integrate mobility information into the exposure
assessment process in order to reduce exposure misclassification.

5. Conclusions

Our findings suggest that exposure to ambient UFPs may increase
the risk of incident prostate cancer. This is the first study to examine the
relationship between ambient UFPs and prostate cancer and our
findings require replication.
