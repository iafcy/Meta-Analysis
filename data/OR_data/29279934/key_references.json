The higher incidence of bone fractures in the placebo group was not significant. Serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase were followed: the greatest changes occurred with methandienone, which thus reduced osteoporotic activity and increased the muscular mass most effectively; calcium carbonate had the poorest effect. Surprisingly, coronary mortality was higher among those taking all three active substances. With two treatments the increase was not significant, but when both the groups receiving a combination of any two of the treatments were compared with those taking only one or neither of these two treatments, a significant increase in coronary deaths was seen, most significant (P less than 0.001) in those receiving vitamin D3 and methandienone.\n",

However, the effect of a calcium supplement of 1000 mg per day on the axial bone density of postmenopausal women with higher calcium intakes is not known.\n## METHODS\nWe studied 122 normal women at least three years after they had reached menopause who had a mean dietary calcium intake of 750 mg per day. The women were randomly assigned to treatment with either calcium (1000 mg per day) or placebo for two years. The bone mineral density of the total body, lumbar spine, and proximal femur was measured every six months by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Serum and urine indexes of calcium metabolism were measured at base line and after 3, 12, and 24 months.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/- SE) rate of loss of total-body bone mineral density was reduced by 43 percent in the calcium group (-0.0055 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year) as compared with the placebo group (-0.0097 +/- 0.0010 g per square centimeter per year, P = 0.005). The rate of loss of bone mineral density was reduced by 35 percent in the legs (P = 0.02), and loss was eliminated in the trunk (P = 0.04). Calcium use was of significant benefit in the lumbar spine (P = 0.04), and in Ward's triangle the rate of loss was reduced by 67 percent (P = 0.04). Calcium supplementation had a similar effect whether dietary calcium intake was above or below the mean value for the group. Serum parathyroid hormone concentrations tended to be lower in the calcium group, as were urinary hydroxyproline excretion and serum alkaline phosphatase concentrations.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation significantly slowed axial and appendicular bone loss in normal post-menopausal women.\n",

            "abstract": "We tested the spine antifracture and bone sparing efficacy of 1.2 g/day of oral calcium as carbonate in two groups of elderly women, one with prevalent fractures (PF, n = 94) on entry and the other without (NPF, n = 103). It was a prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in mostly rural communities in women over age 60 who were living independently and were consuming < 1 g/day of calcium. We obtained annual lateral spine radiographs and semiannual forearm bone density over 4.3 +/- 1.1 years and determined vertebral fractures by radiographic morphometry augmented by physician assessment. In the PF group, 15 of 53 subjects on calcium had incident fractures, compared with 21 of 41 on placebo (p = 0.023, chi2). Calcium did not reduce the rate of incident fractures in the NPF group. Those with a prevalent fracture on entry and not treated with calcium were 2.8 times more likely to experience an incident fracture than all others. Change in the forearm bone mass on placebo in the PF group was -1.24 +/- 2.41%/year compared with +0.31 +/- 1.80%/year on calcium (p < 0.001). In the NPF group, the difference was less: -0.39 +/- 2.08%/year versus 0.00 +/- 1.64%/year (p = 0.2). We conclude that in elderly postmenopausal women with spine fractures and selfselected calcium intakes of < 1 g/day, a calcium supplement of 1.2 g/day reduces the incidence of spine fractures and halts measurable bone loss.\n",

The women were seen every 6 months; 177 completed the trial. Net percentage changes in each group are given relative to baseline. The differences in net percentage changes (calcium group minus placebo group) in medians were: for lumbar spine bone density, 2.0% (p < 0.001) at year 1 and 0.3% (not significant) at year 4; for proximal femur bone density, 1.3% (p = 0.003) at year 1 and 1.3% (p = 0.015) at year 4; and for total body bone mineral, 0.4% (p = 0.002) at year 1 and 0.9% (p = 0.017) at year 4.

We conclude that long-term administration of calcium supplements to elderly women partially reverses age-related increases in serum PTH level and bone resorption and decreases bone loss. However, the effects on bone loss were weaker than those reported for estrogen, bisphosphonates, or calcitonin therapy, indicating that calcium supplements alone cannot substitute for these in treating established osteoporosis. Nonetheless, because of their safety, high tolerance, and low expense, calcium supplements may be a useful preventive measure for elderly postmenopausal women whose bone mineral density values are normal for their age.\n",

We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial of the effect of supplementation with calcium carbonate on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 930 subjects (mean age, 61 years; 72 percent men) with a recent history of colorectal adenomas to receive either calcium carbonate (3 g [1200 mg of elemental calcium] daily) or placebo, with follow-up colonoscopies one and four years after the qualifying examination. The primary end point was the proportion of subjects in whom at least one adenoma was detected after the first follow-up endoscopy but up to (and including) the second follow-up examination. Risk ratios for the recurrence of adenomas were adjusted for age, sex, lifetime number of adenomas before the study, clinical center, and length of the surveillance period.\n## RESULTS\nThe subjects in the calcium group had a lower risk of recurrent adenomas. Among the 913 subjects who underwent at least one study colonoscopy, the adjusted risk ratio for any recurrence of adenoma with calcium as compared with placebo was 0.85 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.98; P=0.03). The main analysis was based on the 832 subjects (409 in the calcium group and 423 in the placebo group) who completed both follow-up examinations. At least one adenoma was diagnosed between the first and second follow-up endoscopies in 127 subjects in the calcium group (31 percent) and 159 subjects in the placebo group (38 percent); the adjusted risk ratio was 0.81 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99; P=0.04). The adjusted ratio of the average number of adenomas in the calcium group to that in the placebo group was 0.76 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.96; P=0.02). The effect of calcium was independent of initial dietary fat and calcium intake.\n## CONCLUSIONS\nCalcium supplementation is associated with a significant - though moderate - reduction in the risk of recurrent colorectal adenomas.\n",

            "abstract": "This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to ascertain the value of calcium citrate supplementation in averting bone loss in 63 postmenopausal women, 57 of whom were early postmenopausal (five years after menopause) and six of whom were mid-postmenopausal (five to ten years after menopause). Bone density data were available for 25 women who took 800 mg of calcium citrate daily and 31 women who received placebo for one to two years. The two groups were similar in baseline age, years postmenopause (3.3 in the calcium citrate group vs 2.7 in the placebo group), height, weight, calcium intake, and L2-L4 bone density. L2-L4 bone density did not change during calcium citrate treatment (+ 1.03% after two years), whereas it declined significantly by -2.38% after two years on placebo (P < .001). Femoral neck bone density did not change in either group. Radial shaft bone density did not change in the calcium citrate group (-0.02% after two years), but it declined significantly in the placebo group (-1.79% after one year and -3.03% after two years, P < .01). The difference in bone density of the L2-L4 vertebrae and radial shaft after two years of treatment was significant between the two groups. An analysis of covariance disclosed no significant effect of calcium citrate on L2-L4 bone density during the first three years after menopause, but a protective effect after three years. Although serum PTH did not change, serum and urinary calcium increased and serum calcitriol and urinary phosphorus decreased in the calcium citrate group, indicative of parathyroid suppression. Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, and urinary hydroxyproline and N-telopeptide decreased during some calcium citrate treatment periods, indicative of a reduction in bone turnover. Thus, calcium citrate supplementation (400 mg of calcium twice daily) averted bone loss and stabilized bone density in the spine, femoral neck, and radial shaft in women relatively soon after menopause. This bone-sparing action was probably due to the inhibition of bone resorption from parathyroid suppression.\n",

A daily dietary supplement of 750 mg calcium or 15 microg 25OH vitamin D3 on bone loss at the hip and other sites, bone turnover and calcium-regulating hormones were studied over 4 yr in elderly volunteers using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turnover markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9 yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr. Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either supplement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD, reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 microg/day 25OH vitamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse calcium insufficiency.\n",

Participants who were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.\n## FINDINGS\n698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those who were not (331 [12.6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13.7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0.94 [95% CI 0.81-1.09]); between participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13.3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13.1%] of 2643; 1.02 [0.88-1.19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12.6%] of 1306 vs 179 [13.4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1.01 [0.75-1.36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life.

To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n\u2009=\u2009353) or an identical placebo (n\u2009=\u2009333). All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at baseline was 65.8\u2009\u00b1\u200922.7\u2009nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately 15\u2009nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864\u2009\u00b1\u2009412\u2009mg/day) and 9 months (855\u2009\u00b1\u2009357\u2009mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333 (27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls. Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a strategy to reduce falls and fractures.\n",

Follow-up was until July 31, 2015, with a mean treatment duration of 3\u00b74 years (SD 0\u00b74, range 2\u00b75-4\u00b72). During follow-up, 2638 participants reported having a fall, 1312 (52%) of 2539 in the vitamin D group compared with 1326 (53%) of 2517 in the placebo group. The HR for falls-adjusted for age, sex, ethnic origin, history of recent fall, physical activity, and baseline 25(OH)D-was 0\u00b799 (95% CI 0\u00b792-1\u00b707; p=0\u00b782) for vitamin D compared with placebo. Non-vertebral fractures were reported in 292 individuals, 156 (6%) of 2558 in the vitamin D group and 136 (5%) of 2550 in the placebo group. The adjusted HR for fractures was 1\u00b719 (95% CI 0\u00b794-1\u00b750; p=0\u00b715) for vitamin D compared with placebo. 123 (2%) people died during the trial, 65 assigned vitamin D and 58 allocated placebo; the difference between treatment groups was not significant.\n## INTERPRETATION\nHigh-dose bolus vitamin D supplementation of 100\u2008000 IU colecalciferol monthly over 2\u00b75-4\u00b72 years did not prevent falls or fractures in this healthy, ambulatory, adult population. Further research is needed to ascertain the effects of daily vitamin D dosing, with or without calcium.\n## FUNDING\nHealth Research Council of New Zealand and Accident Compensation Corporation of New Zealand.\n",

            "abstract": "## BACKGROUND\nInadequate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D may contribute to the high prevalence of osteoporosis among older persons.\n## METHODS\nWe studied the effects of three years of dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D on bone mineral density, biochemical measures of bone metabolism, and the incidence of nonvertebral fractures in 176 men and 213 women 65 years of age or older who were living at home. They received either 500 mg of calcium plus 700 IU of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) per day or placebo. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, blood and urine were analyzed every six months, and cases of nonvertebral fracture were ascertained by means of interviews and verified with use of hospital records.\n## RESULTS\nThe mean (+/-SD) changes in bone mineral density in the calcium-vitamin D and placebo groups were as follows: femoral neck, +0.50+/-4.80 and -0.70+/-5.03 percent, respectively (P=0.02); spine,+2.12+/-4.06 and +1.22+/-4.25 percent (P=0.04); and total body, +0.06+/-1.83 and -1.09+/-1.71 percent (P<0.001). The difference between the calcium-vitamin D and placebo groups was significant at all skeletal sites after one year, but it was significant only for total-body bone mineral density in the second and third years. Of 37 subjects who had nonvertebral fractures, 26 were in the placebo group and 11 were in the calcium-vitamin D group (P=0.02).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nIn men and women 65 years of age or older who are living in the community, dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D moderately reduced bone loss measured in the femoral neck, spine, and total body over the three-year study period and reduced the incidence of nonvertebral fractures.\n",

We randomly assigned participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental [corrected] calcium as calcium carbonate with 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers.\n## RESULTS\nHip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture (0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97).

Combined vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.\n## INTRODUCTION\nThe putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K(1) (phylloquinone) on BMD and the possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in healthy Scottish women > or =60 years of age.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nHealthy, nonosteoporotic women (n = 244) were randomized to receive either (1) placebo, (2) 200 microg/day vitamin K(1), (3) 10 microg (400 IU) vitamin D(3) plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined vitamins K(1) and D(3) plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables.\n## RESULTS\nSignificant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum vitamin K(1) increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH decreased by 11% (p = 0.049).\n## CONCLUSIONS\nThese results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally relevant intakes of vitamin K(1) together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D(3) to enhance BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in gamma-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.\n",

To determine whether daily 800 IU of vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium supplementation prevents fractures, we randomized 3432 women of the population-based Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) Study cohort (ages 65 to 71 years) living in the region of northern Savonia, Finland (latitude 62 degrees to 64 degrees N) for 3 years to receive 800 IU of cholecalciferol and 1000 mg of calcium as calcium carbonate or to a control group that did not receive placebo. The main outcome measure was incident fractures. Fracture data were collected in telephone interviews and validated. Data on 3195 women, 1586 in the intervention group and 1609 in the control group, were available for analysis. In adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, the risk of any fracture decreased in the vitamin D and calcium group by 17% [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-1.12], and the risk of any nonvertebral fracture decreased by 13% (aHR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.63-1.19). The risk of distal forearm fractures decreased by 30% (aHR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.41-1.20), and the risk of any upper extremity fractures decreased by 25% (aHR = 0.75; 95% CI 0.49-1.16), whereas the risk of lower extremity fractures remained essentially equal (aHR = 1.02; 95% CI 0.58-1.80). None of these effects reached statistical significance. In conclusion, this study did not produce statistically significant evidence that vitamin D and calcium supplementation prevents fractures in a 65- to 71-year-old general population of postmenopausal women.\n",
