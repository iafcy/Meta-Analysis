ABSTRACT: Dietary supplementation with vitamin K , with vitamin D and calcium or their combination,
1 3
was examined in healthy older women during a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Combined
vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the
ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius.

significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status

decreased by 11% (p (cid:1) 0.049).
Conclusions: These results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally
relevant intakes of vitamin K together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D to enhance
1 3
BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in
(cid:3)-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by
increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.
