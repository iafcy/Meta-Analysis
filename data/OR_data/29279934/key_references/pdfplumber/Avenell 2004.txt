Purpose We assessed the effects of an open trial design (no placebo and people
know what tablets they are given) compared with a blinded, placebo-controlled
design on recruitment, compliance and retention within a randomized trial of
secondary osteoporotic fracture prevention.
Methods We undertook a randomized controlled comparison nested within a
placebo-controlled trialofnutritionalsupplementationamongstpeopleaged70years
oroverwho had previouslysustained afracture, recruited in a UKteaching hospital.
Randomization was 2:1 infavourofthe blinded, placebo-controlled trial design.
Results From 180 eligible participants randomized to receive information based on
the open trial design, 134 (74.4%) consented to take part, compared with 233
(65.1%) of 358 people randomized to the blinded, placebo-controlled design

retention ofthe open trial no tabletgroup compared to the open trial tabletgroup
(difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9-35.2%). The odds ratio for
reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-
controlled designwas0.64(95%confidenceinterval 0.28-1.49), andforreporting a
fracturewas 0.81 (0.36-1.85).
Concluslons We concludethatusing an open trial design mayenhance participant
recruitmentand retentionandthusimprovegeneralizabilityandstatistical power, but
withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the
