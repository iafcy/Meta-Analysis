Table 2 shows that compared to baseline, hand grip strength
increased in the placebo group at 3 months, but decreased in
both groups at 9 months. TUG fell in both groups at 3 and

were no significant differences between the two treatment

During the study period, there were no significant differences

Discussion
The multiple strengths of our study include the number of
participants,therandomizationprocess,theplacebocontrol,the
supervised administration of treatment, the high compliance,
and the blinding of treatment allocation. Despite these
strengths, vitamin D administered as oral cholecalciferol
