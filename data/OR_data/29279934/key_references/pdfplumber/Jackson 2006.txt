We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already
enrolled in a Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned *The Women’s Health Initiative investiga-

400 IU of vitamin D daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average

follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers. N Engl J Med 2006;354:669-83.

Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than
in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants
receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip
fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture
(0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi
increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence
interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to
the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to
prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.
Conclusions
Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation
resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not signifi-
cantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones. (ClinicalTrials.gov
