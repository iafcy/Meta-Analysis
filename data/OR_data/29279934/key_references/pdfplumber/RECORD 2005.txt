Findings 698 (13%) of 5292participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The
incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those
who were not (331 [12·6%] of 2617 vs367 [13·7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0·94 [95% CI 0·81–1·09]); between

24months, 2886 (54·5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8·5%) had died, 58 (1·1%) had withdrawn, and 1897
(35·8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with
tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9·4% [95% CI 6·6–12·2]), partly because of
gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between
groups.
Interpretation The findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitaminD3, either alone
or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.
