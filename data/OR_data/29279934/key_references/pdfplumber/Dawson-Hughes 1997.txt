DISCUSSION
In this study, dietary supplementation with calci-
um and vitamin D reduced bone loss moderately in
men and women 65 years of age or older who were
living in the community. Among the men, there was
a significant effect of treatment at the hip, spine, and
10
total body. In an earlier study by Orwoll et al., a
similar regimen of calcium and vitamin D had no ef-
fect, perhaps because the men in that study were
younger and had a higher mean calcium intake than
the men we studied (1160 vs. about 700 mg per
day).18 The reduction in total-body bone loss in
women in this study was similar to that in other tri-
5
als of calcium supplementation alone.3,4 The esti-
mated differences in bone mineral density at the
femoral neck and spine among the women in the
two study groups were similar to those found in oth-
er studies,2-4,6,10,11,25 although the differences did not
reach statistical significance in our study. The effect
of supplementation in all subjects was similar to that
