ABSTRACT
We report a 4-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 236 normal postmenopausal
women (mean age 6 SE, 66.3 6 0.2 years) who were randomized to a calcium (1600 mg/day as the citrate) or
placebo group. The women were seen every 6 months; 177 completed the trial. Net percentage changes in each
group are given relative to baseline. The differences in net percentage changes (calcium group minus placebo
group)inmedianswere:forlumbarspinebonedensity,2.0%(p<0.001)atyear1and0.3%(notsignificant)at

calcium to elderly women for 4 years decreases the age-
