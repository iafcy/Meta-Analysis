calcium supplementation additionally decreases fracture

However,thissamefindinghasbeenreportedbyHeikinheimo
and colleagues(19) in a Finnish population with annual
intramuscular injections of 150,000 to 300,000 IU of ergocalci-
ferol. While this has been reported only in these two Finnish
trials, it is possible that the preventive effect, that is, the
improvement in balance, has a clearer effect on falling in high
northern latitudes, where snow-related slips/falls are more
frequent.
