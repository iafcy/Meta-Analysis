ABSTRACT
PURPOSE: Calciumhasbeenshowntohavepositiveeffectsonbonemineraldensityinpostmenopausal

calciummonotherapyisinconsistent.
METHODS: Arandomizedcontrolledtrialofcalcium(1g/dayasthecitrate)in1471healthypostmeno-
pausal women (aged 74(cid:1)4 years) was performed to assess the effects on bone density and fracture
incidenceover5years.
RESULTS: Follow-upwascompletein90%ofsubjects,andaveragemedicationcompliancewas55%to
58%. Calcium had a significant beneficial effect on bone density (intention-to-treat analysis), with

CONCLUSIONS: Calcium results in a sustained reduction in bone loss and turnover, but its effect on
fracture remains uncertain. Poor long-term compliance limits its effectiveness. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

The apparent increase in hip fracture incidence in the
present study is surprising, particularly in light of the ben-
eficial effects of calcium supplementation on density at the
total hip and femoral neck. This trend in hip fractures is
contrary to that seen elsewhere in the skeleton. In light of
this, and the clear evidence in the literature that calcium
combined with vitamin D prevents hip fractures,15 it is

approximately 50%, and there was significant contamina-
tionfromothertherapies.Thisresultissimilartothatofthe
present study. A study of the same size and duration as the
presentonehasrecentlybeenpresented.16Theintention-to-
treat analysis showed a relative risk of fracture of 0.85,
which reduced to 0.66 in the protocol-compliant cohort.
Both studies are suggestive but not conclusive of a weak
anti-fracture effect.
The present study highlights the difficulties inherent in
theuseofcalciumsupplementation,bothinthecontextofa
clinicaltrialandinclinicalpractice.Thesedosesofcalcium
are bulky, usually requiring multiple tablets each day. This
results in considerable problems with subject adherence,
complicating trial interpretation and clinical utility. The
increased incidence of constipation is confirmed in the
presentstudyandislikelytolimitadherence.However,this
studyisreassuringinregardtocalcium’seffectsonironand
magnesium levels, although it finds no benefit on muscle
strength, falls, or tooth loss.
The present study is larger and longer than any study of
calcium monotherapy yet published. As such, it is able to
establish the beneficial effects of calcium supplementation
on bone density with greater certainty than has been possi-
ble thus far. It also shows that calcium effects on bone
