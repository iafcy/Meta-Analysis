# Oral vitamin D3 and calcium for secondary prevention of low-trauma fractures in elderly people (Randomised Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D, RECORD): a randomised placebo-controlled trial

_The RECORD Trial Group*_

### Summary
Background Elderly people who have a fracture are at high risk of another. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are
**often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or**
**in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures.**

Methods In a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were
**mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg**
**calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who**
**were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by**
**intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures.**

Findings 698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The
**incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ significantly between participants allocated calcium and those**
**who were not (331 [12·6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13·7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0·94 [95% CI 0·81–1·09]); between**
**participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13·3%] of 2649** **_vs 345 [13·1%] of 2643; 1·02_**

**[0·88–1·19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12·6%] of 1306 vs**
**179 [13·4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1·01 [0·75–1·36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all-**
**new fractures, fractures confirmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By**
**24 months, 2886 (54·5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8·5%) had died, 58 (1·1%) had withdrawn, and 1897**
**(35·8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with**
**tablets containing calcium was significantly lower (difference: 9·4% [95% CI 6·6–12·2]), partly because of**
**gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between**
**groups.**

Interpretation The findings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone
**or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people.**

### Introduction
Low-trauma fractures in elderly people are a substantial
and increasing burden of ill health,[1,2] and those who have
a low-trauma fracture are at high risk of another.[3] Low
serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites are
widespread in elderly people in the UK,[4] especially in
those with low-trauma fractures.[5] Vitamin D and
calcium, alone or in combination, are often
recommended for prevention of osteoporotic fractures.
Inadequate vitamin D status, exacerbated by low calcium
intake, might raise the risk of these fractures by
increasing bone resorption and loss from secondary
hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D might also protect
against falls that lead to fracture.[6] Evidence from
randomised trials favours the combination of calcium
and vitamin D.[7] In this secondary-prevention study we
aimed to test whether calcium and vitamin D, alone or in
combination compared with placebo, would lead to one
less person per 100 having a fracture every year over a
median of 3 years


### Methods
#### Participants
15 024 people age 70 years or older who had had a lowtrauma, osteoporotic fracture in the previous 10 years
were assessed between Feb 1, 1999, and March 31, 2002.
The trial was based in 21 hospitals in the UK. Ethics
approval was obtained from the Multicentre Research
Ethics Committee for Scotland and from the local
research ethics committee of each hospital, and
participants gave written informed consent.
Study nurses identified potential participants from
hospital notes of patients seen in a fracture clinic or
orthopaedic ward; patients were also recruited by
telephone. Reasons for exclusion were: bed or chair bound
before fracture; cognitive impairment indicated by an
abbreviated mental test score[8] of less than seven; cancer in
the past 10 years that was likely to metastasise to bone;
fracture associated with pre-existing local bone
abnormality; those known to have hypercalcaemia; renal
stone in the past 10 years; life expectancy of less than


-----

6 months; individuals known to be leaving the UK; daily
intake of more than 200 IU vitamin D or more than
500 mg calcium supplements; intake in the past 5 years of
fluoride, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, tibolone, hormonereplacement therapy, selective oestrogen-receptor
modulators, or any vitamin D metabolite (eg, calcitriol);
and vitamin D by injection in the past year. An
osteoporotic fracture was defined as a fracture due to a fall
from no more than standing height, or as a definite
clinical event with radiologist-confirmed evidence of a
vertebral fracture. Fractures of the cervical spine, face, or
skull, and those caused by road-traffic accidents were not
classed as osteoporotic.

#### Study design
Participants were randomly allocated to four equal groups
and assigned two tablets with meals daily consisting of
800 IU vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium (given as carbonate),
vitamin D3 (800 IU) combined with calcium (1000 mg), or
placebo. Tablets varied in size and taste and thus each had
matching placebos. All materials were delivered by post
every 4 months[9] and participants were asked to take tablets
until trial closure.
Randomisation was centralised; computer-generated;
stratified by centre; and minimised by age (younger than
80 years or 80 years and older), sex, time since fracture
(previous three months or longer), and type of fracture
(proximal femur, distal forearm, clinical vertebral, or
other).
The allocation programme was written by the trial
programmer (GCM) and the allocation remained
concealed until the final analyses (other than for
confidential reports to the data monitoring committee). All
outcomes were reported or verified by people who were
masked to the allocation scheme.
Compliance was measured by a postal questionnaire
sent every 4 months, in which participants were asked
how many days of the past 7 days they had taken tablets. A
randomly selected 10% sample (525 participants) was
asked to return unused tablets for pill counting. 375 (71%)
individuals returned pills.
Intake of dietary calcium and vitamin D was assessed
by food-frequency questionnaires based on those of
Nelson[10] and the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey,[4]

respectively; sunlight exposure was assessed by a
question about time spent outdoors during different
seasons.
25-OH-vitamin D3 was quantified after extraction from
plasma by use of straight-phase high-performance liquid
chromatography[11] (lower detection limit 3 ng/mL). Intraassay coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 10% and
interassay CV was less than 12% in the range
10–40 ng/mL. Intact parathyroid hormone was measured
by immunometric assay (Nichols Institute, San Juan,
Capistrano, CA, USA) with a detection limit of
0·5 pmol/L, and inter-assay and intra-assay CV of less
than 5% in the range 1 40 pmol/L Independent analysis


of the tablets was done by Tepnel Scientific Services,
Edinburgh, UK.
The time interval from randomisation to trial closure
was between 24 and 62 months (median 45, IQR 37–52).
The principal outcome measure was all-new low-energy
fractures including clinical, radiologically confirmed
vertebral fractures, but not those of the face or skull. Data
for further fractures and deaths were obtained from
several sources: postal questionnaires every 4 months with
telephone follow-up if needed; hospital and generalpractice staff; nominated friends or relatives of
participants; and national routine data-collection systems
of the UK Office of National Statistics, the Information
and Statistics Division (Scotland), and the Hospital
Episode Statistics gathered by the Department of Health in
England. Confirmation of fracture was always sought
from a second source. Moreover, data for health status (as
assessed by Short-Form 12[12] and Euroqol-5D),[13] hospital
admission, change of residence, falls, and possible adverse
events were obtained from the postal questionnaires and
were supplemented by further clinical information on
potentially serious adverse events. Differential effects on
falls were assessed by one question in every questionnaire:
“Have you fallen during the last week?”. In two trial
centres (Southampton, and Newcastle-Upon-Tyne), a
sample of participants had blood taken for assessment of
25-OH-vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone before
starting supplementation and 1 year after randomisation.

#### Statistical analysis
The sample size was based on a factorial design to test
calcium versus no calcium and vitamin D3 versus no
vitamin D3. The anticipated incidence of new fractures in
the control group was 15%, based on similar trials. The
aim was to enrol 4200 participants to give 80% power
(2P�0·05) to detect a decrease in incidence to 12%.
Furthermore, the sample size was anticipated to have over
80% power to identify a 2% absolute difference in rates of
hip fracture. Initially, 6500 participants were sought, on
the basis of expected losses to follow-up of 35%. However,
this number was adjusted during recruitment (June, 2001)
to 5200 participants on the basis of a higher rate of
retention. An independent data and safety monitoring
committee met yearly, and on each occasion recommended continuation to achieve maximum recruitment.
Analysis was done 2 years after the last person was
recruited and was based on intention-to-treat. Dichotomous outcomes (ie, yes/no questions from the questionnaire) were analysed over 24 months by use of logistic
regression, and over the total duration of follow-up by use
of Cox regression. Quality-of-life outcomes were examined
by ANCOVA, with adjustment for 4-month quality-of-life
scores as baseline. All analyses were adjusted for
minimisation variables. Interaction between calcium and
vitamin D3 was tested for. Previously specified subgroup
analyses were done after stratification by: high or low
weight (less than 55 kg or not); latitude of recruitment

centre (northern, central [south of Durham and north of
London], or southern); dietary calcium (high [�700 mg
per day], moderate [400–699 mg per day], or low [�400 mg
per day]); and vitamin D exposure from the sun or diet
(high or low [ie, participants did or did not go outdoors or
had a dietary intake of less than 200 IU vitamin D per day,
respectively]). Analysis based on compliance status (still
taking tablets on �80% days at 2 years or not) was also
done, with tests for treatment by subgroup interactions.
The main outcome was subdivided into categories of
fracture to investigate possible differential effects. Stricter
levels of significance (2P�0·01) were sought because of
the exploratory nature of the analyses.
We have adhered to the principles outlined in the
CONSORT statement for reporting randomised
controlled trials,[14] and to those outlined by McAlister and
colleagues[15] for reporting of factorial designs.
The protocol for this study was peer reviewed and
accepted by _The Lancet; a summary of the protocol was_
published on the journal’s website, and the journal then
made a commitment to peer-review the primary clinical
manuscript.

#### Role of the funding source
The UK Medical Research Council funded the central
organisation of RECORD, and Shire Pharmaceuticals
funded the drugs, which were cofunded and
manufactured by Nycomed. Shire Pharmaceuticals and
Nycomed were given the opportunity to comment on the
penultimate version of the trial report. No funding source
had any role in the collection, management, analysis, or
interpretation of the data; writing of the report; or the
decision to submit the paper for publication. The
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the
study and had final responsibility to submit for
publication.

### Results
Figure 1 shows the trial profile. Of 15 024 people assessed,
about a third joined the trial and about 3500 of those who
were eligible did not participate. Those recruited were
younger (mean age 77 years [SD 6]) than were those who
declined (80 years [6]) or who were ineligible (82 years [7]).
The main reasons for ineligibility were cognitive
impairment (2666 [43·0%]), current antiosteoporotic

treatment (2103 [33·9%]), and previous excluding
cancer (680 [11·0%]); this group also had a higher
incidence of previous proximal-femur fracture than
those recruited (2239 vs 904 [36·1% vs 17·1%]). Table 1
shows baseline characteristics. Half the initial
notifications of further fractures came from responses
to the participant questionnaire alone and half from
other sources.
Postal-questionnaire data for compliance and quality
of life after excluding deaths were available for 4514
(86·6%) of 5210 participants at 4 months, 3991 (78·7%)
of 5068 at 12 months, and for 3591 (74·2%) of 4841 at
24 months. Based on questionnaire responses at
24 months, 2886 (54·5%) of 5292 were still taking
tablets, 451 (8·5%) had died, 58 (1·1%) had withdrawn,


and 1897 (35·8%) had stopped tablets but were still
providing data on at least the main outcome measures.
Table 2 shows compliance at 24 months. Throughout
the trial about 80% of those taking tablets did so on
more than 80% of days, which is consistent with pill
counts in the subsample (data not shown). However,
the number who were taking any tablets fell over time.
At 4 months, 3398 (68·7%) of the 4949 who returned
questionnaires had taken pills on more than 80% of
days (or 3398 [65·2%] of 5210 after assuming nonresponders were non-compliers and excluding known
deaths). The equivalent figures up to 12 months were
2554 of 4251 (60·1%) or 2554 of 5068 (50·4%), and up
to 24 months were 2268 of 3765 (60·2%) or 2268 of
4841 (46·8%).

_Table 2: Compliance at 24 months_


-----

Poor compliance with calcium tablets (table 2; difference
9·4%, 95% CI 6·6–12·2) was associated with more
frequent decisions to stop because of gastrointestinal
symptoms or difficulties in taking the tablets.
Furthermore, gastrointestinal symptoms were the main
reason why more people allocated calcium than those
allocated vitamin D3 reported possible side-effects (428

[16·4%] for those assigned calcium _vs 319 [11·9%] for_
those not; 363 [13·7%] for people assigned vitamin D3 vs
386 [14·5%] for those not). Possible serious adverse effects
were rare: renal insufficiency (seven participants), renal
stones (four) and hypercalcaemia (21) and did not differ
between the groups (data not shown). At 1 year, 35 (3·5%)
of 997 of participants allocated placebo were taking drugs
active on bone (mainly bisphosphonates), and 20 (2·0%)
participants allocated placebo were taking prescribed
calcium or vitamin D either alone or in combination. At
2 years, 40 (4·5%) of 892 participants assigned placebo
were taking bone-active drugs and 25 (2·8%) were taking
open calcium or vitamin D either alone or in combination.
These rates were similar in the calcium and vitamin D
groups.
Overall, 698 (13%) participants had a new low-trauma
fracture, 183 (4%) of whom had a hip fracture. 331
(12·6%) of 2617 participants allocated calcium had a new
low-trauma fracture compared with 367 (14%) of
2675 participants not allocated calcium (hazard ratio [HR]
0·94 [0·81–1·09]). The incidence of new low-trauma
fractures did not differ significantly between those
allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (table 3 and
figure 2), or between those allocated combination
treatment and those allocated placebo (HR for interaction
term 1·01 [0·75–1·36]). No differences were seen between
the trial groups with respect to the incidence of all
fractures, radiographically confirmed fractures, hip
fractures, other types of fracture; death; and time to
fracture or death (table 3). Moreover, there was no
evidence of differential effects on fracture risk or that
calcium or vitamin D3 had an effect in the previously


specified subgroups (figure 3), especially for the type of
fracture at recruitment. No difference was recorded in the
groups who complied with treatment (ie, per protocol
analysis). Overall, 761 (14·4%) participants reported
having a fall during the weeks studied and the groups did
not differ significantly in this respect. Table 4 shows no
difference in quality of life at 4 months and at 2 years.
Two batches analysed by inductively coupled plasma
emission spectrometry had a mean value of 421 mg
calcium per tablet (SD 14), and five batches analysed by
high-performance liquid chromatography had a mean
value of 372 IU vitamin D3 per tablet (SD 38).
The mean baseline concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D3
for a sample of 60 participants was 15·2 ng/mL (SD 6·5).
After 1 year of supplementation, concentrations rose by
9·6 ng/mL (6·9) for participants allocated combination
treatment, 9·7 ng/mL (8·7) for participants allocated
vitamin D3, 1·4 ng/mL (5·7) for those assigned calcium,
and by 3·1 ng/mL (7·2) for those allocated placebo.

Similarly, a subsample of 60 participants had mean
baseline concentrations of parathyroid hormone of
5·5 pmol/L (11 [19%] of whom had a concentration of
�6·9 pmol/L, SD 2·4), which decreased by 1·9 pmol/L
(2·2) for participants assigned combination treatment,
0·7 (1·6) for vitamin D3, 1·6 (1·6) for calcium, and by
0·7 (1·5) for placebo.

### Discussion
In this trial of secondary-fracture prevention, incidence
of fractures did not differ between those allocated any
calcium versus no calcium, between those allocated any
vitamin D3 versus no vitamin D3, or between those
allocated combination treatment versus placebo.


As expected, the rate of further low-trauma fracture was
high (one in eight). However, there were fewer hip
fractures than anticipated, which was related to the
tendency for older people to be ineligible because of
cognitive impairment (43% of participants in this trial) or
because they had already been prescribed bone-active
drugs (34%). Both these groups are likely to be at higher
risk of further fractures than participants in this trial. Few
participants were enrolled after a vertebral fracture, and
such patients might be more responsive to treatment.[16] A
possible explanation for the findings is that true
differences were underestimated because of chance. The
trial was large, involving more than 5000 participants with
a minimum follow-up of 24 months, and 698 had at least

one new low-trauma fracture. At the start of the trial the
aim was to identify a 20% relative difference (3% absolute
difference). The lower ends of the 95% CI around the HR
for the principal analyses were 0·805 for calcium and
0·879 for vitamin D3, indicating that a true effect of that
size is very unlikely, on the basis of these results.
As expected, it was difficult to maintain compliance with
allocated tablets: participants were elderly, usually taking
other medications, and comorbidity was common. By the
time data collection had stopped, one in six had died. By
2 years, compliance (defined as a participant who took
�80% of tablets) was 60% of those who returned
questionnaires. All analyses were based on the intentionto-treat principle, and so effectiveness in this context
rather than efficacy was measured. Comparison of
compliance in this trial with that of other trials is difficult
because rates of compliance with tablets and drop-outs are
often not well reported. There were different rates of
questionnaire response in the trial groups, especially for
comparisons of calcium because of increased rates of
possible side-effects in these groups. Although imbalances in the response rate in different groups could
introduce bias into comparisons that are based only on
questionnaire responses (eg, quality of life), this bias
seems unlikely for fractures and deaths because these data
were derived from several sources and the pattern of
results was similar irrespective of the source of
identification.
There was no evidence that supplementation might be
especially useful for specific groups (figure 3) or that true
differences could have been obscured by poor compliance.
A possible mechanism for fracture prevention was a
reduced incidence of falls. For pragmatic reasons, we
chose to address this issue through one question in every
follow-up questionnaire that was sent every 4 months
asking about falls during the previous week. Although this
method undoubtedly underestimated true rates of falls,
there was no evidence of any difference between groups.
The results for participants assigned vitamin D3 alone
and those assigned calcium alone are consistent with an
overview of similar trials in that they suggest no
significant effect.[7,17] However, results of individual trials
using vitamin D vary. In a primary-prevention trial of a
single dose of 100 000 IU oral vitamin D every 4 months,
Trivedi and colleagues[18 ]reported a marginally significant
22% beneficial effect. However, primary-prevention
trials[19,20] of 400 IU oral vitamin D3 taken every day have
shown no significant effect on the incidence of all types of
fracture. A UK study[21] of 9000 healthy mobile older
women and men showed no reduction in fracture risk
after three injections of 300 000 IU vitamin D3 per year.
By contrast with Chapuy and colleagues’[22–24] and
Dawson-Hughes’[25 ]primary-prevention trials, we did not
find a significant effect of combined calcium and vitamin
D3 on fracture prevention. However, our study population
was younger and less frail than were the participants in
Chapuy and co workers’ trials and most were mobile and


living in the community. Therefore, the participants in
our trial might have been less likely to have vitamin D
insufficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism than
those in the trials by Chapuy and colleagues. Our
participants were, however, older than were participants
in Dawson-Hughes’ trial. Concentrations of 25-OHvitamin D3 achieved with supplementation seem lower in
our trial than in these other trials,[18,22–25] although
differences in analytical techniques make comparisons
difficult. We also showed less suppression of parathyroid
hormone than did others,[22,23,25] but more suppression than
in a later trial.[25] The amount of vitamin D needed to
ensure optimum blood concentrations of 25-OHvitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone is debatable. As
much as 4000 IU per day has been suggested,[26] but this
amount has yet to be tested in a fracture-prevention trial.
Secondary-fracture prevention is now widely practised.
Our trial indicates that routine supplementation with
calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, is
not effective in the prevention of further fractures in
people who have had a recent low-trauma fracture.
Secondary analyses did not identify subgroups that might
benefit from supplementation, such as those individuals
(17% of those enrolled) who had had a hip fracture before
enrolment. These participants were older (mean
79·4 years [SD 6·3] vs 77·0 [5·3]) and twice as likely to die
(28% vs 15%) during the trial than those with a non-hip
fracture. Policies for secondary prevention should
therefore consider other strategies. The main
pharmacological intervention is antiresorptive drugs, such
as bisphosphonates, which have rarely been assessed in
patients who have not been taking calcium or vitamin D.
This trial was not designed to directly address whether
supplementation should be used as a primary-prevention
measure or in those who live in a care-home environment.
Clarification of the role of supplementation in these
settings awaits the results of other trials.
