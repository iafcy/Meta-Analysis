    The effects of an open design on trial participant
    recruitment, compliance and retention - a
    randomized controlled trial comparison with a
    blinded, placebo-controlled design

       Marion K Campbell' and Magnus A McGee' for the RECORD Trial Management Group
                Background In randomized trials there may be no overriding reason whether or not
                 to have a placebo control.
                Purpose We assessed the effects of an open trial design (no placebo and people
               know what tablets they are given) compared with a blinded, placebo-controlled
                 design on recruitment, compliance and retention within a randomized trial of
                secondary osteoporotic fracture prevention.
               Methods We undertook a randomized controlled comparison nested within a
                placebo-controlled trial of nutritional supplementation amongst people aged 70 years
                 or over who had previously sustained a fracture, recruited in a UK teaching hospital.
                Randomization was 2:1 in favour of the blinded, placebo-controlled trial design.
                  Results From 180 eligible participants randomized to receive information based on
                 the open trial design, 134 (74.4%) consented to take part, compared with 233
                (65.1%) of 358 people randomized to the blinded, placebo-controlled design
                 (difference 9.4%, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.4%). Reluctance to take a placebo
                and the desire to know tablet allocation were reasons given for not taking part in the
                 blinded, placebo-controlled design. There was no significant difference in tablet
                compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year
                 (difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1-24.6%), mainly reflecting the high
                 retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group
                 (difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9-35.2%). The odds ratio for
                 reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-
                 controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.49), and for reporting a
                 fracture was 0.81 (0.36-1.85).
                Concluslons We conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant
                 recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but
                withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the
                 intemal validity of the trial. Clinical Trals 2004; 1: 490-498. www.SCTjournal.com
