**ABSTRACT**


**PURPOSE:** Calcium has been shown to have positive effects on bone mineral density in postmenopausal
women. However, these effects are small, it is unknown whether they are sustained with long-term use,
they have not been shown with intention-to-treat analyses, and the evidence for fracture prevention with
calcium monotherapy is inconsistent.
**METHODS:** A randomized controlled trial of calcium (1 g/day as the citrate) in 1471 healthy postmenopausal women (aged 74 � 4 years) was performed to assess the effects on bone density and fracture
incidence over 5 years.
**RESULTS:** Follow-up was complete in 90% of subjects, and average medication compliance was 55% to
58%. Calcium had a significant beneficial effect on bone density (intention-to-treat analysis), with
between-groups differences at 5 years of 1.8% (spine), 1.6% (total hip), and 1.2% (total body). Effects were
greater in a per-protocol analysis (5-year differences of 2.3%, 2.8%, and 1.8%, respectively). A total of 425
fractures occurred in 281 women. Hazard ratios, based on time to first fracture, were 0.90 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.71-1.16) for any symptomatic fracture, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.44-1.18) for vertebral, 3.55 (95%
CI, 1.31-9.63) for hip, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.41-1.04) for forearm fracture. Per-protocol analysis found
respective hazard ratios of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.64-1.17), 0.62 (95% CI, 0.33-1.16), 3.24 (95% CI, 0.65-16.1),
and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.24-0.87). Height loss was reduced by calcium in the per-protocol population (P � .03).
Serum alkaline phosphatase and procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide were lower in the calcium group
at 5 years, but constipation was more common.
**CONCLUSIONS:** Calcium results in a sustained reduction in bone loss and turnover, but its effect on
fracture remains uncertain. Poor long-term compliance limits its effectiveness. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

Calcium is the principal mineral constituent of bone, and the
use of calcium supplements has long been advocated for the
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. There is now
clinical trial evidence that calcium has positive effects on
bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.[1-3] However, these effects have been small and would only be
clinically significant if they were progressive with continued use. Because most studies have lasted �2 years, this is

not known.[4] In addition, most studies have involved modest
numbers of subjects and not provided intention-to-treat
analyses, so the quality of the evidence for prevention of
bone loss by calcium is poor by currently accepted
standards.
Several studies of calcium monotherapy have suggested
that the reduced bone loss in postmenopausal women is
associated with a reduction in fracture risk of up to one
half,[5-7] but meta-analysis of the available studies does not
demonstrate convincing evidence for fracture protection.[4]

There is also evidence that combined intervention with
calcium and vitamin D reduces fractures in the elderly.[8-11]

software version 1.7). Incident vertebral fractures were
defined as a decrease in any vertebral height of more than
20%, provided that the absolute decrease was at least 4
mm. Each vertebra that met these criteria was reviewed
by 2 experienced clinicians to ensure that the identification of vertebral margins was correct.
Subjects were asked at each 6-month visit about fractures. If reported, the relevant radiograph or report was
obtained. If a subject reported an episode suggestive of
fracture but a radiograph had not been taken, then this
was arranged. Symptomatic vertebral fractures diagnosed
independently of the study’s assessments were classified
as “clinical fractures” as long as they also met the criteria
for definition of an incident vertebral fracture.
Subjects kept a diary of falls. Grip strength was measured in triplicate in the dominant hand. Height was
measured using a Harpenden stadiometer. Serum 25hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured at baseline by radioimmunoassay (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN).
Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity, iron, ironbinding capacity, ferritin, and magnesium were measured
on a Roche Modular autoanalyzer (Roche, Stockholm,
Sweden). The Roche Elecsys 2010 platform was used for
serum osteocalcin, serum �-C-terminal telopeptide of
type I collagen (�-Crosslaps, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and serum procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide (PINP). Adverse events were recorded at
each visit, but specific symptoms were not.
The study was approved by the local ethics committee,
and each subject gave written informed consent. The study
was registered with the Australian Clinical Trials Registry,


#### Statistics
The primary end point of the study was the time to first
clinical fracture at any site. Secondary end points were bone
density and the following fracture subgroups: total vertebral
fractures, hip fractures, distal forearm fractures, and osteoporotic fractures (comprising all fractures except those of
the head, hands, feet, and ankles, and resulting from major
trauma). Pathologic fractures (eg, resulting from local malignancy) were excluded from all analyses. Intention-totreat and per protocol analyses were carried out. Because of
the likelihood that other anti-osteoporotic therapies would
have much greater effects on bone density and fracture than
calcium, the per-protocol analysis was prespecified as
primary.
The study was powered (80%, with �� 0.05) to detect a
40% decrease in fracture rate, because previous studies had
suggested an effect of this magnitude.[5-7] The time to first
fracture was modeled using a Cox proportional hazards
approach with adjustment for the stratification variables
(age and thiazide use). The proportional hazards assumption
was verified, and a log-rank statistic was estimated. Comparisons between treatment and placebo arms were made
using the Fisher exact test for categoric data and the Student
unpaired t test for normally distributed continuous variables. For adverse events with indistinct individual start and
stop dates (eg, constipation) the number of individuals experiencing at least one episode was compared between
groups (Fisher exact test). Events per woman-year also were
accumulated and presented as rate (95% confidence interval

[CI]). All analyses were conducted using the programs of
SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A P value less than .05

ance was approximately 85% in both treatment groups in
each 6-month period. When subjects who discontinued trial
medication are included, compliance over the entire study
was 58% in the placebo group and 55% in the calcium
group (P � .13).

#### Bone Mineral Density
In the intention-to-treat analyses, calcium supplementation
had a beneficial effect on densities throughout the skeleton
(Figure 2). In the spine, there was no loss in the placebo
group, but an increase of 1.5% in the calcium group at 30
months. This was maintained until the trial’s end, at which
time the between-groups difference was 1.8%. The patterns
of loss were more linear in both the total hip and total body,
with between-groups differences at 5 years of 1.6% and
1.2%, respectively. The calcium effect on density was most
evident in the first half of the study. When changes between
30 and 60 months alone were analyzed, there was no significant treatment effect in the spine and total body, although there was in the total hip (P � .04).
To determine whether the effect of calcium on density
was influenced by dietary calcium intake, a series of breakpoints from 400 to 1000 mg/day were considered. Only
when the cohort was divided at 800 mg/day, did those with
lower intakes have larger increases in total hip density in
response to calcium supplementation (P � .007). A similar
analysis of the influence of age showed no interaction of age
with treatment effect.
Analysis of data from the per-protocol population with
compliance greater than 60% showed a similar pattern of
density changes (Figure 3). Between-groups differences at 5
years were 2.3% in the spine, 2.8% in the hip, and 1.8% in
the total body. This represents a 64% reduction in bone loss
at the hip and 59% reduction in total body loss in the
calcium group. In this analysis, the waning of the effect in
the second half of the study was much less evident, and the
between-groups differences increased significantly during
this time at the hip (P � .0002) and total body (P � .0009),
suggesting that decreasing compliance contributed to the
waning effect in the intention-to-treat analysis.

A total of 425 fractures (204 in the calcium group, 221 in
the placebo group) occurred in 281 women (134 in the

The cumulative proportion of all first clinical fractures in
the intention-to-treat population is shown in Figure 4, and
the hazard ratios for various fracture categories are shown in
Table 2. For total clinical fractures and osteoporotic fractures, there was little evidence of a difference between
groups, although hip fractures were more common in those
allocated to calcium, and forearm fractures seemed to be
less common in this group.
Because of the likelihood that any therapeutic effect of
calcium would be overshadowed by the effects on bone of

shown in the lower part of Table 2 and Figure 5, and suggest
that calcium reduces fractures, although this was only significant for forearm fractures. In the placebo group, 229
subjects had at least one 6-month period in which compliance was less than 60%, similar to that of the 240 subjects
in the calcium group.
Height loss, a surrogate for vertebral fracture, was linear
in both groups. At 5 years in the intention-to-treat analysis,
mean (� standard error) loss was 10.3 � 0.2 mm in both
groups (P � .46). The per-protocol population with compliance greater than 60% showed height losses of 9.9 � 0.3
mm in the placebo group and 9.0 � 0.3 mm in the calcium
group (P � .03), consistent with the trend to fewer vertebral
fractures.

#### Bone Turnover Markers
Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in all
subjects at baseline and 5 years (Figure 6). Values decreased
more in the calcium group than in the placebo group during
the study (11% vs 6%, P � 0.001. Other markers were
measured at 5 years only in 80 subjects who were still
taking study medication (40 chosen randomly from each
group). PINP levels were 22% lower in the calcium group
(P � .03). Serum osteocalcin and �-C-terminal telopeptide
of type I collagen concentrations were also slightly lower in
the calcium group than in the placebo group (16% and 15%,
respectively), but neither of these differences was
significant.

#### Other Measures
To assess the possibility that calcium might impact on
muscle function and the frequency of falls, grip strength was
assessed at each visit. Baseline mean values were comparable (placebo, 18.4 kg; calcium, 18.6 kg, P � .33). Over the
study period, grip strength declined by 0.51 � 0.14 kg in the
placebo group and by 1.2 � 0.15 kg in the calcium group
(least squares means � standard error, P � .04). The incidence of falls was 595 per 1000 woman-years (95% CI,
566-626) for calcium, and 585 per 1000 woman-years (95%
CI, 556-615) for placebo (P � .81).
In the 80 subjects who had serum assessments at 5 years,
the calcium and placebo groups showed comparable levels
of iron (18 � 6, 18 � 4 �mol/L), iron-binding capacity
(56 � 7, 55 � 9 �mol/L), ferritin (156 � 117, 134 � 111 �g/
L), and magnesium (0.84 � 0.08, 0.85 � 0.06 mmol/L)
(mean � standard deviation, all P values � .4).
Loss of at least one tooth occurred in 25.6% (95% CI,
21.5-30.2) of women in the placebo group, compared with
28.8% (95% CI, 24.4-33.6) in those randomized to calcium
(P � .33).

#### Adverse Events
Constipation was reported by 132 women (18%) in the
calcium group and by 82 women (11%) allocated to placebo
(P � .0002). Two subjects in the calcium group had urinary

was performed in which subjects were excluded from the
time they started on a bone-active medication (eg, bisphosphonates, estrogen, glucocorticoids) or from the time when
they were diagnosed with malignancy (Table 2, middle
panel). This produced results similar to those of the intention-to-treat analysis, except that a significant increase in
hip fractures was no longer found, and the trends elsewhere
toward benefit with calcium were slightly greater. A further
analysis then excluded subjects during periods in which

(336, compared with 296, P � .02). Health reasons were
more often cited as the reason for tablet discontinuation in
the calcium group (133, compared with 105 for placebo
group, P � .04). This difference seemed to be fully accounted for by the increased incidence of constipation in the
calcium group.

#### DISCUSSION
This study confirms the beneficial effects of calcium supplementation on bone density in healthy older women. It
shows that these benefits are present throughout the skeleton, that they are independent of age, and that they are
present in individuals with both high and low dietary calcium intakes. These results provide confirmation of similar
findings in a number of smaller studies, but the size of the
present trial allows these conclusions to be reached with
much greater certainty. In particular, the beneficial effects
of calcium supplementation on bone density are clearly
statistically significant when analyzed with a rigorous intention-to-treat approach; most previous studies of calcium
supplementation have only published data from subjects
who were protocol- and medication-compliant. The present
study has the further advantage that its duration is greater
than that of almost all such studies in the past. This allows
the time course of the effect of calcium on bone density to
be assessed more adequately. Although most of the beneficial effect of calcium on bone density in the spine and total


to-treat analysis, there are cumulative benefits evident in the
proximal femur. The per-protocol analysis, however, shows
a cumulative benefit over time in both the proximal femur
and the total body, suggesting that decreasing compliance is
a major contributor to the apparent plateauing of effect. This
implies that use of calcium supplementation over longer
periods is likely to result in even greater effects on bone
density.
The bone density findings are reinforced by the bone
marker data, which indicate that even after 5 years, a reduction in bone turnover is still present in subjects taking
calcium. The 3 bone-specific markers assessed show similar
degrees of suppression; the fact that this was only statistically significant for PINP is probably a reflection of the
lesser variability of this measure. Thus, the present study
establishes more clearly than previously that calcium supplementation provides a significant and sustained reduction
in bone turnover, which results in modest positive effects on
density.
The positive findings with density in this study contrast
with the lack of a clear-cut effect of calcium on fracture
rates. The intention-to-treat analysis would be consistent
with a small beneficial effect on total numbers of symptomatic fractures. When subjects are censored from the time that
they developed major protocol violations or became noncompliant with study medication, the trends to fracture
reduction become more marked, but are still not conclusive.
Thus, the present study leaves the important question of the

(85 � 20 in each group) but decreased more in the calcium group

out suggestions from the very limited data available to date
that total fracture numbers might be reduced by as much as
50%.[7] However, the 10% to 20% reduction in total fracture
rate suggested by this study would be of value in the large
osteopenic population that sustains the majority of postmenopausal fractures.[14] The present data provide a substan

future meta-analysis, because it comprises more womenyears than the total in the Shea review.[4]

The apparent increase in hip fracture incidence in the
present study is surprising, particularly in light of the beneficial effects of calcium supplementation on density at the
total hip and femoral neck. This trend in hip fractures is
contrary to that seen elsewhere in the skeleton. In light of
this, and the clear evidence in the literature that calcium
combined with vitamin D prevents hip fractures,[15] it is
likely that the present result is a chance finding arising from
the small numbers of this particular fracture.
The importance of the issue of the anti-fracture efficacy
of calcium is attested to by the recent presentation of several
large studies. The RECORD study[12] recruited subjects aged
more than 70 years with a history of fracture. Median
follow-up was 45 months. For the calcium intervention, the
hazard ratio was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.09). Compliance was
approximately 50%, and there was significant contamination from other therapies. This result is similar to that of the
present study. A study of the same size and duration as the
present one has recently been presented.[16] The intention-totreat analysis showed a relative risk of fracture of 0.85,
which reduced to 0.66 in the protocol-compliant cohort.
Both studies are suggestive but not conclusive of a weak
anti-fracture effect.
The present study highlights the difficulties inherent in
the use of calcium supplementation, both in the context of a
clinical trial and in clinical practice. These doses of calcium
are bulky, usually requiring multiple tablets each day. This
results in considerable problems with subject adherence,
complicating trial interpretation and clinical utility. The
increased incidence of constipation is confirmed in the
present study and is likely to limit adherence. However, this
study is reassuring in regard to calcium’s effects on iron and
magnesium levels, although it finds no benefit on muscle
strength, falls, or tooth loss.
The present study is larger and longer than any study of
calcium monotherapy yet published. As such, it is able to
establish the beneficial effects of calcium supplementation
on bone density with greater certainty than has been possible thus far. It also shows that calcium effects on bone
turnover are sustained over time. Although contributing
these important findings, the study did not resolve the critical question of whether calcium is able to reduce fracture
incidence. It is probably only through meta-analysis that
this question will be addressed, and the present study makes
an important contribution to the quantity of data available
for such future analyses. In the meantime, the role of calcium in fracture prevention remains uncertain.
