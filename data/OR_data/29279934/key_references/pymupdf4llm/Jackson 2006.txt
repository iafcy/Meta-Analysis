**Background**

The efficacy of calcium with vitamin D supplementation for preventing hip and other
fractures in healthy postmenopausal women remains equivocal.

**Methods**

We recruited 36,282 postmenopausal women, 50 to 79 years of age, who were already
enrolled in a Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial. We randomly assigned
participants to receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate with
400 IU of vitamin D3 daily or placebo. Fractures were ascertained for an average
follow-up period of 7.0 years. Bone density was measured at three WHI centers.

**Results**

Hip bone density was 1.06 percent higher in the calcium plus vitamin D group than
in the placebo group (P<0.01). Intention-to-treat analysis indicated that participants
receiving calcium plus vitamin D supplementation had a hazard ratio of 0.88 for hip
fracture (95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.08), 0.90 for clinical spine fracture
(0.74 to 1.10), and 0.96 for total fractures (0.91 to 1.02). The risk of renal calculi
increased with calcium plus vitamin D (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95 percent confidence
interval, 1.02 to 1.34). Censoring data from women when they ceased to adhere to
the study medication reduced the hazard ratio for hip fracture to 0.71 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.97). Effects did not vary significantly according to
prerandomization serum vitamin D levels.

**Conclusions**

Among healthy postmenopausal women, calcium with vitamin D supplementation
resulted in a small but significant improvement in hip bone density, did not significantly reduce hip fracture, and increased the risk of kidney stones. (ClinicalTrials.gov
number, NCT00000611.)

steoporosis, a major cause of injury, loss of independence, and death,[1,2]
contributes to more than 300,000 hip
fractures in the United States annually.O [3] Observational evidence[4] and data from randomized clinical trials[5,6] suggest that calcium or vitamin D
supplements or both may slow bone loss[5,6] and
reduce the risk of falls[7,8] in postmenopausal and
elderly women. However, evidence from trials,[5,9-19]
observational studies,[20,21] and meta-analyses[6,22,23]
of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with
respect to hip and other fractures is limited. In
two recent randomized trials, calcium plus vitamin D supplements (1000 mg of calcium and 800
IU of vitamin D3) did not reduce the risk of nonvertebral fractures among older women.[18,19] When
the calcium plus vitamin D trial of the Women’s
Health Initiative (WHI) was designed, in the early 1990s, guidelines recommended daily intakes
of 800 to 1200 mg of calcium with 400 IU of vitamin D for the prevention of osteoporosis. Many
American women consumed less.
In this context, the WHI calcium with vitamin D trial was designed to test the primary hypothesis that postmenopausal women randomly
assigned to calcium plus vitamin D supplementation would have a lower risk of hip fracture and,
secondarily, of all fractures than women assigned
to placebo.[24] Another secondary hypothesis was
that women receiving calcium with vitamin D
supplementation would have a lower rate of colorectal cancer than those receiving placebo; the results of that investigation are reported elsewhere
in this issue of the Journal.[25]


Methods


**Participants and Study Design**

Participants enrolled in the WHI Dietary Modification trial, WHI Hormone Therapy trials, or both
were invited to join the calcium with vitamin D
trial at their first or second annual follow-up visit.
Detailed descriptions of the eligibility criteria and
recruitment methods have been published previously.[24]

Eligible women were 50 to 79 years of age at
the initial screening and had no evidence of a
medical condition associated with a predicted
survival of less than three years and no safety,
adherence, or retention risks. Exclusion criteria
included hypercalcemia, renal calculi, corticosteroid use, and calcitriol use. Personal supplemen

_f_

tal calcium (up to 1000 mg per day) and vitamin D (up to 600 IU per day) were allowed. In
1999, after the publication of reports from the
Institute of Medicine,[26,27] the upper limit of personal vitamin D intake was raised to 1000 IU.
The calcium with vitamin D trial permitted the
use of bisphosphonates and calcitonin. Use of
estrogen (with or without a progestin) was according to randomization among women in the
Hormone Therapy trials. Independent use of hormone therapy or selective estrogen-receptor modulators was permitted for women in the Dietary
Modification trial.
Eligible women were randomly assigned in a
double-blind fashion to receive supplements or
placebo (provided by GlaxoSmithKline) in equal
proportions with use of a permuted-block algorithm stratified according to clinical center and
age. Active tablets, chewable or swallowable (after
July 1997), contained 500 mg of elemental calcium (as calcium carbonate) and 200 IU of vitamin D3. Participants were instructed to take two
tablets per day in divided doses and with meals
to maximize absorption. Cross-sectional comparison of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels from 227
women taking active supplements and 221 women taking placebo two years after randomization
revealed that the 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was
28 percent higher among the women assigned to
active calcium plus vitamin D than among those
assigned to placebo.
The protocol was approved by the institutional
review board at each participating institution.
Written informed consent was obtained from
each woman at the calcium with vitamin D randomization visit. The WHI Investigators and National Institutes of Health sponsors all contributed to the design and execution of the study. All
the authors contributed to drafts or revisions of
the manuscript. Statistical analyses and data management were conducted at the WHI Clinical
Coordinating Center, and the investigators and
statistical team vouch for the completeness and
veracity of the data and statistical analyses.

**Follow-up and Data Collection**

The presence and severity of symptoms, safety
concerns, and outcomes were ascertained at annual clinic visits and telephone or clinic visits at
intervening six-month intervals.[24] Adherence to
the study medication was established by weighing returned pill bottles during clinic visits. Par

ticipants were followed for major outcomes, regardless of their adherence to the study medication,
until death, loss to follow-up, or study close-out.
Risk factors for fracture were assessed by questionnaire, interview, and clinical examination.
The total daily calcium intake before randomization was defined as the sum of the following: the
dietary calcium intake (assessed with the use of
a modification of the Block food-frequency questionnaire[28]), the intake of calcium from supplements in the previous two weeks, and the intake
of calcium from prescription medications (assessed
through an interviewer-administered medication
survey). Total vitamin D intake was similarly determined on the basis of diet and supplement use.

**Discontinuation of Study Medications**

During the trial, intolerable gastrointestinal symptoms were managed without unblinding by reducing the number of times per day or days per
week that the study medication was taken. If renal calculi or hypercalcemia developed or renal
dialysis was required, calcium with vitamin D
study medication was permanently discontinued,
according to the protocol.

**Ascertainment of Outcomes**

Total fractures were defined as all reported clinical fractures other than those of the ribs, sternum, skull or face, fingers, toes, and cervical vertebrae. All included fractures were verified by
review of radiologic, magnetic resonance imaging,
or operative reports by centrally trained and blinded physician adjudicators at each clinical center.[24] Final adjudication of hip fractures was performed centrally by blinded adjudicators; agreement
between central and local adjudication was 94
percent.
A subgroup of 2431 women (1230 in the calcium with vitamin D group and 1201 in the placebo group) at 3 of the 40 clinical centers (Pittsburgh; Birmingham, Ala.; and Tucson, Ariz.)
underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry of
the lumbar spine (L2, L3, and L4), total hip, and
total body (QDR 2000, QDR 2000+, or QDR
4500W; Hologic). Bone mineral density was measured at the calcium with vitamin D randomization visit and at annual visits 3, 6, and 9 according
to standard protocols.[24] Three Hologic phantoms
(spine, hip, and linearity) were exchanged among
these three centers and measured in array mode
five times, once each day for five consecutive days,


to assess cross-calibration. Spine, hip, and linearity phantoms were in close agreement (interscanner variability, <1.5 percent for the spine, 4.8 percent for the hip, and 1.7 percent for linearity).

**Analysis of Vitamin D Levels**

Blood specimens, which were obtained after an
overnight fast, were collected at the randomization visit. To determine whether the effect of calcium plus vitamin D on the risk of fracture varied
according to prerandomization 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, a nested case–control study was performed with all adjudicated cases of hip, spine,
and lower arm or wrist fracture used as cases
(357 case–control pairs for hip fracture and 1491
pairs for total fracture). Controls were free of fracture for the duration of the study and were individually matched to case participants according to
age, latitude of the clinical center, race or ethnic
group, and date of venipuncture. Levels of 25hydroxyvitamin D were measured with the use of
the DiaSorin Liaison chemiluminescent immunoassay system at DiaSorin headquarters (Stillwater, Minn.) in one continuous batch with blinded control runs at periodic intervals (coefficient of
variation, 11.8 percent).

**Statistical Analysis**

All primary outcomes were analyzed on a timeto-event basis according to the intention-to-treat
principle. We present both the total number of
events and the annualized percentage for these
fracture rates for each group. Comparisons are
represented with hazard ratios and nominal 95
percent confidence intervals from Cox proportional-hazards models, stratified according to
age group, prior fracture, and randomization status (randomly assigned to active hormone therapy
or placebo, dietary intervention vs. dietary control,
or both) in the Hormone Therapy and Dietary
Modification trials.
To assess whether the effect of calcium with
vitamin D on the risk of fracture varied according
to baseline levels of risk factors, the same Cox
proportional-hazards models were extended. In
formal tests for interaction, continuous variables
were used whenever possible. Fifteen participant
characteristics were examined for each of four
fracture outcomes. Up to three statistically significant interaction tests (P<0.05) would be expected on the basis of chance alone.

tive supplements or placebo), sensitivity analyses
were conducted in which participants were allowed
to contribute follow-up time until six months after the first visit at which nonadherence, defined
as use of less than 80 percent of the study medication, was detected. Full-adherence hazard ratios
were also estimated with inverse probability of
censoring weighted estimators with adjustment for
10 covariates associated with adherence.[29]

Changes in bone mineral density during follow-up were calculated as mean percent differences (and standard errors) from bone mineral
density at the time of enrollment in the calcium
plus vitamin D trial. Linear regression was used
to compare rates of change in bone mineral density between the groups, after adjustment for
clinical center and race or ethnic group.
The calcium with vitamin D trial was designed


**Baseline Characteristics**

Between 1995 and 2000, 36,282 women were randomly assigned in the calcium with vitamin D
trial: 18,176 were assigned to active supplementation, and 18,106 to placebo. Demographic characteristics, health behavior, and medical history
were well balanced between the groups at baseline (Table 1). The women had a mean age of 62
years and a mean body-mass index (the weight in
kilograms divided by the square of the height in
meters) of 29. Sixteen percent were not white.
The average calcium intake was approximately
1150 mg per day. More than half the women (52
percent) were taking hormone therapy (10,725
reported personal use of hormones, and 8117 had
been randomly assigned to receive active-hormone
study medication). The rate of use of other osteoporosis medications was 1 percent (1 used a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, 366 bisphosphonate, and 33 calcitonin).

**Retention and Adherence**

At the termination of the trial, on March 31, 2005,
1551 participants (4.3 percent) had died and 2.7
percent had withdrawn or had been lost to follow-up (Fig. 1). The rate of adherence (defined as
use of 80 percent or more of the assigned study
medication) ranged from 60 to 63 percent during
the first three years of follow-up, with an additional 13 to 21 percent of the participants taking
at least half of their study pills. At the end of the
trial, 76 percent were still taking the study medication, and 59 percent were taking 80 percent or
more of it.

**Bone Mineral Density**

Women receiving calcium with vitamin D supplements had greater preservation of total-hip bone
mineral density at annual visits 3, 6, and 9 than
women assigned to placebo (Fig. 2). The mean
differences between the treatment groups, all in
favor of calcium with vitamin D, were 0.59 per

**Secondary and Subgroup Analyses**

Among women who were adherent (i.e., those who
took at least 80 percent of their study medication),
calcium with vitamin D supplementation resulted in a 29 percent reduction in hip fracture (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95 percent confidence interval,
0.52 to 0.97); there were 167 cases of hip fracture
among these women (Table 2). The hazard ratio

The hazard ratio for hip fracture among women
60 years of age or older was 0.79 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.98), with an indication


of increased risk among women 50 to 59 years of
age (P for interaction = 0.05) (Table 3). There was
a lower hazard ratio among women with no falls
than among women with at least one fall (P for
interaction = 0.05). No other significant interactions were observed for any fracture outcome.
There was no evidence that either baseline

levels of total calcium or total vitamin D intake
modified the association between calcium with
vitamin D supplementation and fracture (Table 3).
Dietary calcium intake remained stable during
follow-up, whereas the intake of calcium from
supplements increased by approximately 100 mg
daily in both treatment groups. In both treatment
groups, participants with initially low levels of
total calcium intake (<400 mg daily) had larger
increases (200 mg daily) in supplemental calcium
intake than did other participants. The effects of
calcium with vitamin D intervention on the risk
of hip fracture tended to be greater among participants not using personal calcium supplements
during follow-up: the hazard ratio was 0.70 (95
percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.98) among
nonusers, 0.87 (95 percent confidence interval,
0.61 to 1.24) among those taking less than 500 mg
per day, and 1.22 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.79) among those taking 500 mg or
more per day (P for interaction = 0.11).
Use of osteoporosis medications increased during follow-up, with 3890 of the women (10.7
percent) taking alendronate, 654 (1.8 percent) taking risedronate, 1094 (3.0 percent) taking raloxifene, and 451 (1.2 percent) taking calcitonin.
Censoring data from these participants after their
first recorded use of these medications yielded
hazard ratios of 0.87 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.09) for hip fracture and 0.93 (95
percent confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.18) for clinical vertebral fracture.

**Serum Vitamin D Levels**

In the nested case–control assessment of 25hydroxyvitamin D, the mean (±SD) baseline 25hydroxyvitamin D level was 46.0±22.6 nmol per
liter among the participants who had hip fracture and 48.4±23.5 nmol per liter among their
controls (P = 0.17). No statistically significant interactions were found between calcium with vitamin D supplementation and baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with respect to either hip or total
fractures (Table 4).

Of the women in the WHI calcium with vitamin

was found to have strong effects on hip and other fractures.[31,32] The hazard ratios for hip frac

interval, 0.81 to 1.63) among those assigned to
placebo (P for interaction = 0.07). When the analyses included both exposure in the randomized
Hormone Therapy trial and personal use, the trend
toward an interaction between calcium with vitamin D supplementation and hormone therapy with
respect to hip fracture was no longer present.

**Safety and Tolerability**

As of March 31, 2005, there were 744 deaths in
the calcium with vitamin D group and 807 deaths
in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.01). No statistically significant risks or benefits were seen
with regard to any major disease outcomes, including cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Kidney stones were reported by 449 women in the
calcium with vitamin D group, as compared with
381 women in the placebo group (hazard ratio,
1.17; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.34),
and appeared to be unrelated to high baseline
calcium intake. There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms: 8.9 percent
of the participants in the placebo group and 10.3
percent of those in the calcium with vitamin D
group reported moderate-to-severe constipation,
and 19.5 percent and 20.4 percent, respectively,
reported bloating or gas.


The WHI calcium with vitamin D study was a
large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial designed to test whether calcium
and vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk
of hip fracture in a large population of healthy
postmenopausal women. The trial demonstrated
that calcium with vitamin D supplementation diminishes bone loss at the hip, but the observed
12 percent reduction in the incidence of hip fracture (the primary outcome) was not statistically
significant. There were no significant reductions
in the incidence of clinical vertebral fractures,
fractures of the lower arm or wrist, or total fractures. The main adverse effect noted was a small
but significant increase in the proportion of
women with renal calculi.

nations for the results seen in the intention-totreat analyses. It is conceivable that calcium with
vitamin D, at the doses studied in the WHI, has
no significant effect on fracture reduction. The
observed lack of efficacy in reducing clinical vertebral fractures is discordant with the results of
meta-analyses of clinical trials that suggest a
trend toward a small reduction in vertebral fractures with calcium alone[6] and a significant, 37
percent reduction in vertebral fractures with vitamin D supplementation.[22] The lack of a reduction in the risk of hip or total fractures would be
consistent with the findings of recent studies that
showed no evidence of reduction in nonvertebral
fractures in healthy, older women living in the
community.[15,18,19]

The effect of calcium with vitamin D supplementation on fracture reduction might require
higher doses of vitamin D than were used in the
WHI. This dose–response concept[33] is supported
by studies indicating that supplementation with
400 IU of vitamin D has a small effect or no effect


on the risk of fracture,[16,17] whereas the majority
of studies supporting a benefit from calcium with
vitamin D supplements evaluated vitamin D at
doses that were the equivalent of 600 IU or
higher.[8,10,13,14,33]

It is also plausible that there was a benefit
only among the women who adhered to the study
treatment. Although 76 percent of the women in
this trial were still taking study pills at the end
of the trial, only 59 percent were taking the intended dose. In sensitivity analyses, there was a
decrease in the risk of hip fracture among adherent participants, yielding an absolute benefit
of four fewer hip fractures per 10,000 women, or
a significant, 29 percent relative decrease — a
finding consistent with the results of other trials
that showed that efficacy in fracture reduction is
enhanced among women adherent to calcium with
vitamin D supplementation[11] or is present only
in this group.
This trial cannot separate the independent effects of calcium and vitamin D. The study popu

lation was not selected to be deficient in calcium
and vitamin D, since the participants were allowed
to take multivitamins as well as calcium and vitamin D up to specified levels during the trial. The
average daily total calcium intake at randomization was estimated to be 1100 to 1200 mg; only
7.2 percent of the participants had an intake of
less than 400 mg.
The effect of calcium with vitamin D supplements may also differ according to baseline vitamin D levels. Chapuy et al. reported that calcium
with vitamin D (1000 mg of calcium and 800 IU
of vitamin D per day) significantly reduced the
risk of hip and nonvertebral fractures among elderly women who were believed to be vitamin D–
deficient (on the basis of low vitamin D levels in
a subgroup analysis at baseline).[10] Studies involving persons who were potentially less deficient
in vitamin D have failed to confirm this benefit.[18] We found no significant interactions between
baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and
a calcium with vitamin D treatment effect.
Finally, it is also plausible that calcium with
vitamin D supplementation has a real but small
effect in reducing the risk of hip fracture among
postmenopausal women, but the WHI calcium
with vitamin D trial was not sufficiently powered
to detect such a small effect, even with 36,282
women enrolled. The trial design assumed an 18
percent reduction in the risk of hip fracture and
projected a hip-fracture rate (approximately 34 per
10,000 persons per year) that was more than
twice that observed (16 per 10,000). The lowerthan-projected hip-fracture rate reduced the power of the study to approximately 48 percent. This
may be attributable to the higher-than-anticipated body-mass index, the recruitment of fewer
women over the age of 70 years than was projected,
or a fracture rate already suppressed by high personal calcium intake or hormone-therapy use.
Some support is provided by subgroup analyses
suggesting that among women over the age of
60 years who had a higher absolute risk of hip
fracture, calcium with vitamin D supplementation
significantly reduced the risk of hip fractures.
The trend toward a reduction in the incidence
of hip fracture, with no benefit at other skeletal
sites, could be consistent with the pathophysiology of hip fracture relative to other osteoporotic
fractures. Up to 60 percent of patients with hip


_f_

fractures have one or more biomarkers consistent
with a negative calcium balance, such as secondary hyperparathyroidism, low 25-hydroxyvitamin
D levels, or low urine calcium excretion.[34] These
perturbations in calcium metabolism associated
with hip fracture might be amenable to treatments
that would improve the calcium balance.
The trial yielded conflicting data regarding hip
fracture and the interaction between hormone use
and calcium with vitamin D supplementation.
Though not statistically significant, the observed
interaction between active calcium with vitamin
D and hormone therapy may reflect a synergistic
role of enhanced calcium balance with hormone
therapy. This possibility is consistent with the
previously reported additive effects of calcium
with vitamin D and hormone therapy on bone
mineral density.[35,36] However, when hormonetherapy use outside the trial was included, there
was no interaction, and a 17 percent reduction in
the incidence of hip fracture with calcium with
vitamin D was observed among participants who
had never used hormone therapy (hazard ratio,
0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.14).
Participants in the WHI trial were healthy,
postmenopausal women living in the community
who were generally free of disability. The average
calcium intake at baseline exceeded 1000 mg per
day, close to the current national recommendations.[37] Nevertheless, we found significantly higher
hip bone density but a nonsignificant reduction
(12 percent) in the rate of hip fracture among
those assigned to calcium with vitamin D. In secondary analyses, the intervention effect appeared
greater among women who adhered to the regimen, women over 60 years of age, and women not
taking personal calcium supplements. Using the
intention-to-treat results from this study, we estimate that for healthy postmenopausal women
over the age of 50 years, the number needed to
treat to prevent one hip fracture per year is 5045.
This number would be reduced to 1914 among
women over the age of 60 years, who are at higher
absolute risk for hip fracture. Although the statistically null primary effect argues against recommending universal calcium with vitamin D
supplementation for already calcium-replete women, the findings provide evidence of a positive
effect of calcium with vitamin D on bone health
in older postmenopausal women.
