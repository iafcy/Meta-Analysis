_Summary_

**In a double-blind trial, 327 patient* (57 men) over 65 (mean age 79.5) years received all possible**
**combinations of calcium carbonate 3 g, vitamin Ds 1000 iu, methandienone 2.5 mg and/or**
**placebos daily for 9 months. The higher incidence of bone fractures in the placebo group was not**
**significant. Serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline**
**phosphatase were followed: the greatest changes occurred with methandienone, which thus**
**reduced osteoporotic activity and increased the muscular mass most effectively; calcium carbonate**
**had the poorest effect Surprisingly, coronary mortality was higher among those taking all three**
**active substances. With two treatments the increase was not significant, but when both the groups**
**receiving a combination of any two of the treatments were compared with those taking only one**
**or neither of these two treatments, a significant increase in coronary deaths was seen, most signifi-**
**cant (P< 0.001) in those receiving vitamin Da and methandienone.**

**INTRODUCTION**

One reason for the increased disposition to bone fractures of elderly people is weakening
of the bones. The most common and important bone-weakening disease is osteoporosis,
in addition to which osteomalacia may sometimes occur, either alone or with the former
(Aaron et al. 1974).
A number of substances, such as calcium, oestrogens, anabolic steroids, vitamin D,
fluoride and calcitonin have been tried in the treatment of osteoporosis. Calcium has
given both positive (Nordin et al. 1975, Spencer et al. 1976) and negative (Smith et al.
1975) results; as also has vitamin D (Nordin et al. 1980, Johnson et aL 1980), and a
positive result (Riggs et al. 1976) for combined treatment with calcium and vitamin D
has been reported. Anabolic steroids have been found to raise total body calcium (Chesnut
et al. 1977), but in elderly people theif effect is usually only anticatabolic (Laitinen 1978).
As none of these treatments has clearly proved effective, we found that there was cause
for further study. The purpose of our study was to clarify the effects of calcium, vitamin D
and anabolic steroids, alone or in combination, in long-term treatment and prevention
of osteoporosis in a large patient material.

_Patients and Methods_

**The trial was performed with 327 residents (57 men) of Koukkuniemi municipal home for the**
**aged, in Tampere city. The age range was 65—97 (mean age ±s.d. was 79.5 ±7.1) years. Subjects**

**with functional disorders of the kidneys (serum creatinine > 150 mmol/1) or liver (serum aspartate**
**aminotransf erase > 40 iu/1 or serum alkaline phosphate > 280 iu/1), kidney stones, or hypercalcaemia**
**(serum calcium > 2.80 mmol/I) were excluded from the trial. Suspected osteoporosis at the start**
**of the trial was not a cause for exclusion.**
**Patients were divided into eight groups according to year and month of birth. Four groups**
**received calcium carbonate (Ca) 3 g daily (=1.2 g of calcium), the other four the corresponding**
**placebo. Vitamin Dj (Da) 1000 iu daily and placebo were given to four, and methandienone (M)**
**2.5 mg daily and placebo to four groups each. Thus, each patient received three preparations of**
**which none, one, two, or all contained one of the active drugs. The placebos were identical with**
**the corresponding active drugs as regards the composition of inert constituents. Cholecalciferol in**
**Ds pills was substituted by soya oil, methandienone in M tablets by lactose, and calcium carbonate**
**in Ca mixture by microcrystaUine cellulose in the placebos.**
**A double-blind trial technique was used. The code was known only to the drug manufacturer**
**(Medica Pharmaceutical Company Ltd.). It was kept in a sealed envelope in the dispensary of**
**the institution while the trial was in progress and was not opened until the results had been**
**analysed. Any other medication that the patients might be receiving was continued as before.**

**The trial started on 1st April 1978. Patients were followed for 1 year, treatment was given for**
**the first 9 months. At the start and end of treatment patients were weighed and measured. Serum**
**calcium, phosphate, creatinine, transaminase and alkaline phosphatase were determined at the**
**start and 2, 9 and 12 months later. The subjective condition was evaluated on a four-grade scale**
**where the highest grade was 'feeling well' and the lowest 'not feeling well'; symptoms were not**
**specified. Other data recorded were: patients interrupting, reasons for interruption, bone fractures,**
**removals to hospital and deaths.**
**Serum-calcium was determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (Cali et al. 1973), serum-**
**phosphate by a modification of the method of Fiske and Subbarow (1925), serum-creatinine by**
**absorption photometry (Clark & Thompson 1949), serum-aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT) and**
**alkaline phosphatase (AFOS) by a kinetic absorption photometric method (Committee on Enzymes**
**1974).**
**From each group 10 patients were selected by lots for radiographic examination of the thoracic**
**and lumbar portions of the spinal column and the wrist bones at the start and end of treatment.**
**For statistical analysis the chi-squared test and linear correlation coefficient were used.**

RESULTS

Starting values and changes in laboratory parameters during treatment and follow-up
are given in Table II. Table III shovre changes in laboratory values of the active treat-
ment groups compared with those of the placebo group.
Ca reduced AFOS, which was seen particularly after 2 months' treatment. When Ca
was combined with M, a reduction in serum-phosphate was also seen after 2 months,
and the creatinine- and ASAT-increasing effects of M were potentiated.

Likewise, D8 reduced AFOS even when used alone. Mean serum-calcium was not
increased by Ds, but three patients developed a transient hypercalcaemia (calcium

           - 2.80 mmol/1) during the 9 months of treatment; one of them received Ds, one Ds+M
and one Ds+M+Ca.
M caused the most pronounced changes: it raised serum-creatinine and ASAT and
reduced AFOS both alone and in combinations. At the end of the treatment (9 months),
ASAT was above the reference value 40 iu in nine patients, but at the end of the follow-up
period (12 months) in only one. Creatinine exceeded 150 mmol/1 in six patients at
9 months and in two at 12 months.
Table IV shows that the weight and height of patients did not change significantly in
any group. Bone fractures were more frequent in the placebo group, but the difference
was not significant.

Of the 140 interruptions, 113 were due to hospitalization, as is seen in Table V.
Cerebrovascular disorder as the cause of hospitalization seems to be more frequent
among patients who took Da (28/181) than among those who did not (14/146). Of those
taking M + Ds, more patients (7/90) went into hospital with coronary disease than in the
other groups (3/237). These differences, however, are not statistically significant.
More patients died suddenly of coronary disease and peripheral vascular diseases
(Table VT) than went into hospital for them (Table V). Coronary disease was the only
fatal cardiac disorder occurring.

From Table VI it appears that the total mortality was highest (P< 0.05) in the group
taking all three active preparations. The difference is seen principally in coronary
mortality (10/47 against 13/280; P<0.001); with regard to other causes of death the
groups did not differ significantly. Also, for women only, the difference in coronary
mortality was significant (P< 0.001).

_Calcium, Vitamin D and Anabolic Steroid in Treatment of Aged Bones_ 129

Among patients taking two active preparations, the coronary mortality (8/125) was
somewhat, though not significantly, higher than among those taking one or none (5/155).
If, on the other hand, the relationship of each treatment combination (D3 + Ca; M + Ca
and Ds + M) with coronary mortality is studied, it is seen that the latter is higher for any
combination (P<0.01; <0.05 and < 0.001, respectively) than in the groups receiving
only one or none of the particular preparations. The most significant increase was seen
when D3 and M were combined (the groups D3+M and Ds+M + Ca); this applied
both to the whole series and to the women.
For those treated with M, the total mortality (42/152) and coronary mortality (16/152)
were higher (P<0.01) than for the others (25/175 and 7/175). For those taking D3 or
those taking Ca, this difference was not significant.
The subjective condition of patients was similar in all groups. Radiography at the start
and end of treatment revealed no differences between groups with regard to measures
of the cortical layer and medullary cavities of the wrist bones.

DISCUSSION

The patients in this trial were grouped strictly according to time of birth; thus, the
groups are not identical with regard to numbers of patients and sex distribution. This
complicates the statistical analysis but does not affect the reliability of the results. Even
the mean age in the groups varied somewhat, but not so much as to be responsible for
the differences, e.g. in coronary deaths. Diseases were fairly evenly distributed over the
groups at the start of the trial. Only in 18 of 327 patients was coronary disease the
primary disorder. Because each treatment was given to four groups and each combination
of two preparations to two groups, the morbidity and mortality in these combined groups
were also studied.
M had the strongest effect on the measured laboratory parameters. The M-induced
rise in creatinine was probably a sign of improved anabolism and increased muscular
mass. A decrease in AFOS was observed in all the active treatment groups and was
believed to come of a reduction of osteoblastic activity. Raised ASAT again was clearly
related to the use of M. No great changes occurred in serum calcium and phosphate
values. Serum-calcium rose in the three-treatment group and a decrease in serum-
phosphate was seen at 2 months in the Ca+M group. In an earlier study (Johnson et al,
1980), vitamin D 2000 iu daily inhibited a fall in serum-phosphate and caused hyper-
calcaemia. In the present study, Ds 1000 iu daily caused hypercalcaemia in three patients.
The incidence of bone fractures was low (10/327 in 12 months) in this study, and
although they were more frequent in the placebo group, no significance could be estab-
lished. In a study performed in 1971-72 at the same institution (Inkovaara et al. 1975),
hah[7] of the patients received sodium monofluorophosphate 25 mg daily for 5 months
and twice a week for an additional 3 months. During the 9-month observation period
14/237 patients in the active treatment group and 6/233 in the control group had bone
fractures. When compared with these results, the preparations in the present study
cannot be said to increase the incidence of bone fractures as does fluoride, but rather
decrease it
A quite surprising observation was the clear increase in coronary deaths—and conse-
quently in total death rate—when all three active preparations or even two, particularly

M 4- D8, were used. Vitamin D in long-term use has been suspected of causing cardiac
infarction (Linden 1974). Testosterone is known to increase thrombocyte aggregation
and perhaps other coronary risk factors (Johnson et al. 1975, 1977, Pilo et al. 1981).
Aloia et al. (1981) found three cardiovascular (two coronary) deaths in a series receiving
anabolic steroid and none in the controls. In the present series neither M nor Ds alone,
but only the two together, seemed to increase coronary morbidity and mortality and
possibly only in women. Thus, simultaneous use of these two drugs should apparently
be avoided.
