Background: The 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) chronic kidney disease–
mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guideline suggests correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D)
levels, 30 ng/mL in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis, but does not provide a specific
treatment protocol.
Study Design: 2-center, double-blind, randomized, 13-week, controlled trial followed by a 26-week openlabel study.
Setting & Participants: 55 adult maintenance hemodialysis patients with 25(OH)D levels, 30 ng/mL were
recruited from June 2008 through October 2009.
Intervention: Cholecalciferol, 25,000 IU, per week orally versus placebo for 13 weeks, then 26 weeks of
individualized cholecalciferol prescription based on NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation–Kidney Disease
Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines.
Outcomes: Primary end point was the percentage of patients with 25(OH)D levels $ 30 ng/mL at 13 weeks.
Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients with normal calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) blood levels. Safety measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D.
Measurements: Blood calcium and phosphate were measured weekly; iPTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, trimonthly; fetuin A and fibroblast growth
factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and aortic calcification scores were determined at weeks 0 and 39.
Results: The primary end point significantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo
group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P, 0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 11 [IQR, 10-15] pg/mL;
P, 0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the target calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P 5 0.03).
Incidence of hypercalcemia and phosphate and iPTH levels were similar between groups. The second 26week study phase did not significantly modify the prevalence of 25(OH)D level $ 30 ng/mL in patients
issued from the placebo group.
Limitations: Small size of the study population.
Conclusions: Oral weekly administration of 25,000 IU of cholecalciferol for 13 weeks is an effective, safe,
inexpensive, and manageable way to increase 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels in hemodialysis patients.
Further evaluation of clinical end points is suggested.

#### parallel.[14,15] Since the 1980s, 1a-hydroxylated forms of vitamin D (also called active vitamin D) became widely used in HD patients and low-priced nutritional forms of vitamin D were neglected.[5] The existence of extrarenal 1a-hydroxylases was suggested by the observation that anephric individuals were able to produce 1,25(OH)2D in response to supraphysiologic nutritional vitamin D challenge.[16,17] However, these findings did not modify prescription habits. Further experimental studies demonstrated that extrarenal 1a- hydroxylases were present in a wide range of tissues acting locally in paracrine or autocrine circuits.[18] That led to the understanding of the pleiotropic properties of 25(OH)D[19-21] and revived interest in this mole- cule.[22-24] In addition, it was noted that 25(OH)D has an excellent safety profile.[16,22,25] For these reasons and despite the absence of any controlled trial or large prospective study, in 2009, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) recommended restora- tion of 25(OH)D levels . 30 ng/mL in patients treated with maintenance HD.[26] However, targeted protocols are still lacking. The high cost of the 25(OH)D assay further complicates drug prescription and the setup of larger clinical trials.[22]
 The present study, combining a 13-week random- ized trial of oral cholecalciferol repletion versus placebo with an open-label study of customized cholecalciferol prescription derived from the NKF- KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation–Kidney


#### Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines[27] for 26 additional weeks aimed to provide valuable in- formation about vitamin D repletion strategies and their possible impact on mineral and bone markers.

### METHODS

##### Definitions

In this study, we defined levels of 25(OH)D ranging from 20
to,30 ng/mL as “insufficient” and levels, 20 ng/mL as
“deficient.”[5]

##### Study Design

 Overview

This was an investigator-driven, prospective, multicenter, partly
randomized, controlled trial (VitaDial) performed in 2 Belgian
nephrology centers (Epicura [in Baudour] and Erasme university
hospitals [in Brussels]). It was approved by the institutional
review board at each site. This 39-week trial was divided into
2 periods as follows: a randomized period (13 weeks) during
which enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive either
cholecalciferol or a placebo, and an open-label period (26 weeks)
during which all patients, regardless of initial allocation, received
a cholecalciferol dose adjusted to their most recent 25(OH)D
assessment (at weeks 13 and 26; Fig 1). This design allowed investigators to collect data for a new cholecalciferol repletion
protocol using substantial doses under safe conditions (first period
limited to 13 weeks) and, in a second phase, gather data reflecting
the use of NKF-KDOQI guidelines, usually prescribed for 6
months (second period of 26 weeks). Finally, by combining both
periods, we investigated the biochemical outcomes of cholecalciferol repletion over a total period of 39 weeks. Another interest
of the present design was to offer cholecalciferol access to all

D3; CKD, chronic kidney disease.

patients, avoiding possibly deleterious effects of long-term
vitamin D deprivation.

##### Randomization Period

The enrollement period was from June 2008 through October
2009. Patients who fulfilled the study entry criteria were randomly
assigned to receive either an oral cholecalciferol preparation or its
vehicle every week for 13 weeks, according to a 1:1 randomization
procedure. Randomization was stratified by center. We used block
randomization with permuted blocks of 4 allocations.

##### Open-Label Period

After the 13-week randomization period, every participant
entered a 26-week repletion phase and received a cholecalciferol
dose adjusted to his or her previous 25(OH)D level as evaluated at
weeks 13 and 26. Cholecalciferol prescriptions were based on the
2003 NKF-KDOQI guidelines for patients with CKD stages 3-4
and adapted for patients with CKD stage 5 due to the absence of
targeted guidelines for these patients[27] (for details, see Fig 1).

##### Participants

Eligible patients were adults (aged $ 18 years) with CKD stage
5 who were receiving HD for at least 3 months with a minimum
of 3 HD sessions per week and who had serum 25(OH)D
levels, 30 ng/mL and had signed the informed consent form
approved by each center’s ethics committee. Exclusion criteria
were as follows: known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the
study medications, pregnancy or lactation period, women without
effective contraception, cholecalciferol and/or calcitriol and/or
paricalcitol and/or alfacalcidol dosage adjustment 1 month prior
to enrollment (the last 3 being the only active vitamin D formulations available in Belgium), plasma calcium level . 10.2 mg/dL,
concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial, prior parathyroidectomy, granulomatous disorder, active malignancy, and/or
estimated life expectancy less than 1 year.

##### Investigational Product and Concomitant Medications

The study drug consisted of 1 mL of groundnut oil solution
containing 25,000 IU of cholecalciferol (D-cure; S.M.B. [drug
marketing authorization number 465S24F11]), whereas the placebo was made by our study pharmacist with the same groundnut
oil as the active drug, coming directly from the D-cure factory.
Placebo and active drug were indistinguishable from each other.
Study preparations were administered orally at the end of the first
or second HD session of the week, under the supervison of the
nurse in charge of the patient. Any other cholecalciferol supplementation was withdrawn. Apart from cholecalciferol, any modification of the medical treatment, including mineral bone disorder–
related drugs, was left to the discretion of the treating nephrologist
following NKF-KDOQI guidelines.

##### Study Outcomes

The primary end point was the proportion of participants with
25(OH)D levels $ 30 ng/mL at week 13.
Secondary end points were the percentage of patients with
appropriate blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and intact
parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Recommended concentrations were
8.5-10.2 mg/dL for calcium, #4.5 mg/dL for phosphate, and
146-657 pg/mL for iPTH (corresponding to 2-9 times the upper
reference limit value in our laboratory) as suggested in the 2009
KDIGO recommendations.
Safety end points included the occurence of hypercalcemia (calcium . 10.2 mg/dL), hypervitaminosis D (defined as
25(OH)D . 100 ng/mL independent of calcium level), adverse
events (fractures), serious adverse events, and malignancies.
Hypercalcemia and/or hypervitaminosis D resulted in the immediate and definitive suspension of the study medication. The onset


or worsening of hyperphosphatemia (phosphate . 5.5 mg/dL) did
not lead to the cessation of study drug, but was treated with
calcium carbonate or calcium-free phosphate binders according to
NKF-KDOQI guidelines.

##### Sample Size Calculation

Based on preliminary data, we hypothesized that the proportion
of patients with a 25(OH)D level, 30 ng/mL would decrease to
70% in the treatment arm compared to 100% in the placebo arm.
We calculated that 22 patients were required in each group to
reach statistical power of 80% with a type I error of 5%. Finally,
we chose to recruit at least 20% extra patients (26 patients per
group) in anticipation of dropouts.

##### Statistical Analysis

Results were expressed as mean 6 standard deviation, median
with interquartile range (IQR), or percentage. Continuous variables were compared using t test or Mann-Whitney test in cases
of non-Gaussian distribution. Paired data were compared using
paired t test, analysis of variance for repeated measures, or
Friedman and Wilcoxon test in cases of non-Gaussian distribution.
Categorical data were compared using c[2] or Fisher exact test.
Paired categorical data were compared using c[2] McNemar test.
Relevant results were expressed as number needed to treat (NNT;
defined as the inverse of absolute risk reduction). All study end
points were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software,
version 12 (StataCorp LP). P, 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

##### Sampling

Blood samplings were performed regularly at the beginning
of the first or second HD session of the week, through the
arterial tubing. Plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus were
checked every week. Serum levels of iPTH, osteocalcin, carboxyterminal telopeptides, bone alkaline phosphatases, 25(OH)D,
and 1,25(OH)2D were assessed every 13 weeks. Extra serum was
collected and frozen (220[�]C) at baseline and end of the study
(week 39) in order to ultimately assess fetuin A and fibroblast
growth factor 23 (FGF-23) levels. When available (.300 mL), a
24-hour urine sample was collected at baseline.

##### Biochemical Assessments

Plasma biochemistry samples were analyzed with a standard
multichannel biochemical analyzer (Modular P; Roche), except
for the following parameters: serum iPTH and 25(OH)D were
measured according to a direct chemiluminescence method
(module LIAISON M; DiaSorin Inc) in the Erasme Hospital
laboratory, Brussels (accredited by DEQAS [Vitamin D External
Quality Assessment Scheme]); serum 1,25(OH)2D was measured
in an experienced laboratory (Brugmann Hospital, Brussels,
Belgium) after extraction, using a competitive radioimmunoassay (DiaSorin Inc); serum levels of osteocalcin and C-telopeptides were evaluated by electrochemiluminescence
technology (module E170; Roche); serum bone alkaline phosphatases were assessed by a chemiluminescence-based immunoenzymatic assay with paramagnetic particles (Beckman
Coulter Inc); serum fetuin A was measured by nephelometry
(assay designed, developed, and performed by Prof W. JahnenDechent, RWTH, Aachen University, Germany). Nephelometric
readings were taken in a MiniNeph single cuvette nephelometer
(The Binding Site). Purified human plasma fetuin A (Dade-Behring)
served as support plotted to derive the calibration curve; FGF-23
carboxy-terminal fragments were measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Immutopics Inc).

##### Radiologic Assessment of Anterior-Posterior Aortic Calcifications

All patients had lateral lumbar radiographs for semiquantification of aortic calcifications at baseline and week 39.
Aortic calcification scores, according to the method published by
Kauppila et al,[28] were established by 2 independent observers in
a blinded and randomized fashion. Scores ranged from 0 (no
calcification) to 24.

### RESULTS

#### Patient Characteristics and Demographics

 Figure 2 shows patient flow throughout the trial. A total of 176 patients were screened: 26 patients subsequently entered the treatment arm and 29 entered the placebo arm. Both groups were well balanced with respect to patient demographics, co- morbid conditions, and medications relative to min- eral bone disorder, as well as season of enrollment (Table 1).


#### Efficacy End Points

 At week 13, a total of 26 and 27 patients remained for analysis in the treament and placebo groups, respectively; 2 patients were lost to follow-up in the placebo group (n 5 1, kidney transplantation; n 5 1, death from arrhythmia). Regarding the primary end point, 16 of 26 (62%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 41%-80%) patients from the treatment group had their 25(OH)D levels normalized ($30 ng/mL) at week 13 versus 2 of 27 (7%; 95% CI, 1%-24%) in the placebo group (P, 0.001; NNT 5 1.8 [95% CI, 1.4-3.4]). Mean 25(OH)D levels were 35.2 6 12.1 ng/mL in the treat- ment group versus 16.4 6 7.8 ng/mL in the placebo group (P, 0.001). At the end of the first period, 1 of 26 (4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-20%) patients in the treatment group versus 17 of 27 (63%; 95% CI, 42%-81%) in the placebo group presented with 25(OH)D deficiency (,20 ng/mL; P, 0.001; NNT 5 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3-2.85]; Fig 3).

#### Patients in the control group had significantly increased serum 1,25(OH)2D levels compared with those in the placebo group (median, 22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 11 [IQR, 10-15] ng/mL, respectively; P, 0.001), leading to a significantly higher percentage of patients with normalized 1,25(OH)2D levels (54% [95% CI, 33%-73%] vs 12% [95% CI, 2%-30%]; P 5 0.001; NNT 5 2.3 [95% CI, 1.6-5.9]; Fig 3). Regarding the secondary end points, at 13 weeks, a higher proportion of treated patients achieved the target for calcium of 8.5-10.2 mg/dL (77% [95% CI, 56%-91%] vs 44% [95% CI, 29%-68%]; P 5 0.02; NNT 5 3.1 [95% CI, 1.9-16.2]). Otherwise, the treat- ment did not significantly affect blood levels of cal- cium, phosphorus, or iPTH (Fig 4) or bone turnover parameters (data not shown; Table S1, available as online supplementary material).

 Impact of Randomization Group on Drug Prescription

 At week 13, bone mineral disorder–targeted treat- ments did not differ according to randomization group (Table S2).

 Safety End Points

 During the randomization period, one patient from the placebo group developed a plasma calcium


#### level . 10.2 mg/dL (10.4 mg/dL). This event was con- comitant to hypovitaminosis D (25[OH]D, 20 ng/mL; 1,25[OH]2D, 14 pg/mL), hypoparathyroidism, and low- dose calcium supplements (iPTH, 40 pg/mL; elemental calcium intake, 0.4 g/d; Table S3). At week 27, hyper- calcemia with a calcium level of 10.3 mg/dL occured in a second patient from the treatment group. Over 26 weeks, he received a total cumulative cholecalciferol dose of 400,000 IU. Hypercalcemia coexisted with an elevated 25(OH)D level (68 ng/mL), low 1,25(OH)2D level (14 pg/mL), high iPTH level (700 pg/mL), and elemental calcium intake of 1.2 g/d (Table S3). During the entire study, no patient developed a 25(OH)D level . 100 ng/mL. The highest levels recorded at weeks 13, 26, and 39 were 57, 81, and 43 ng/mL, respectively. Corresponding calcium levels were 9, 8.5, and 8.3 mg/dL, respectively.
 Table 2 shows a summary of the incidence of serious adverse events. Patients who received chole- calciferol in the first 13 weeks of the study experi- enced no bone fractures and fewer hospitalizations for falls compared with patients who received pla- cebo treatment in the first phase of the study. Nine patients from the placebo group experienced 10 distinct fracture episodes during the entire study period.

#### repletion was achieved (overall 25[OH]D level, 17.9 6 7 ng/mL at baseline vs 26.2 6 9 ng/mL at week 39; P, 0.001) without significant change in 1,25(OH)2D levels (median of 13.5 [IQR, 9-17] pg/ mL at week 0 vs 15 [IQR, 10-21] pg/mL at week 39; P 5 0.3), calcium, phosphate, or iPTH (data not shown) blood levels. A statistically significant decrease in serum fetuin A levels was observed (median of 0.39 [IQR, 0.34-0.42] mg/mL at week 0 vs 0.33 [IQR, 0.29-0.36] mg/mL at week 39; P, 0.001). Levels of carboxy-terminal telopeptides, bone alkaline phosphatases, osteocalcin, and FGF-23 did not change significantly.

 Vascular Calcification Scores

 At week 39, patients had similar calcification scores (median, 4.5 [IQR, 1-12.5] vs 11 [IQR, 2-14]; P 5 0.4) regardless of whether they had received treatment (n 5 21) or placebo (n 5 16) in the first 13 weeks of the study. Taking into account available paired scores (n 5 30) for a longitudinal comparison between weeks 0 and 39, calcification scores remained stable (median, 7 [IQR, 2-14] vs 7.5 [IQR, 2-15]; P 5 0.3). Of note, 15 of 53 patients without a history of cholecalciferol treatment had a higher calcification score at baseline (median, 13 [IQR, 6-18] vs 7 [IQR, 1-14]; P 5 0.05).


#### Comparison of Our Repletion Protocol With NKF- KDOQI Guidelines

 In patients who were in the placebo group for the first 13 weeks of the trial, cholecalciferol supple- mentation based on the 2003 NKF-KDOQI guidelines significantly reduced the proportion of patients with a 25(OH)D level, 30 ng/mL (from 92% to 54%) after 13 weeks (22/24 vs 13/24 at weeks 13 and 26, respectively; P 5 0.007). This effect was not sus- tained at week 39, with this proportion increasing again to 65% (21/23 vs 15/23 at weeks 13 and 39, respectively; P 5 0.07). In the placebo arm, cholecalciferol supplementa- tion based on the 2003 NKF-KDOQI guidelines significantly reduced the proportion of 25(OH)D- deficient patients (from 63% to 17%) after 13 weeks (15/24 vs 4/24 at weeks 13 and 26, respectively; P, 0.001) and also after 26 weeks (13/23 [57%] vs 5/23 [22%] at weeks 13 and 39, respectively; P 5 0.008). Finally, the respective proportions of patients with persistently low 25(OH)D levels (either,20 or,30 ng/mL) were compared between the treatment group at week 13 and the placebo group at weeks 26 and 39. There was a nominally lower proportion of patients with persistent 25(OH)D levels, 30 ng/mL in patients treated with our study repletion protocol at week 13 compared with patients from the placebo arm treated with the NKF-KDOQI recommendations after 26 weeks, but this result was not statistically significant (10 of 26 [38%] vs 14 of 21 [67%]; P 5 0.05).
### DISCUSSION

#### Therapeutic strategies to correct vitamin D defi- ciency have not been studied extensively in main- tenance HD patients. Our randomized study showed that administration of a weekly dose of 25,000 IU of cholecalciferol over 13 weeks resulted in normalization of 25(OH)D levels ($30 ng/mL) in 62% of patients, in 1,25(OH)2D levels $ 20 pg/mL in 54%, and in calcium concentrations within the KDIGO normal range in 77% without serious adverse events. Patients in the treatment group experienced dramatically fewer bone fractures and hospitalizations for falls than patients in the placebo group. Despite the limited size of our patient cohort, our findings reinforce prior studies associating 25(OH)D deficiency with increased risk of fracture among patients on maintenance HD therapy or those supporting the positive impact of vitamin D on muscle strength and balance in the elderly and patients with CKD.[8,29-31]
 Decades ago, it was shown that anephric humans and 5/6 nephrectomized dogs, unlike healthy indivi- duals, increased their 1,25(OH)2D levels in response

#### to a supraphysiologic cholecalciferol challenge.[16,17]
 Several clinical prospective studies confirmed the incremental effects of 25(OH)D supplementation on 1,25(OH)2D levels in patients with CKD stage 5. However, inconsistent results were obtained for PTH and calcium levels.[2,3,11,32,33] Only a few randomized controlled studies described the increment of 1,25(OH)2D levels after cholecalciferol challenge in HD patients.[10,11,13] None was able to confirm a sig- nificant impact on either PTH or calcium levels. However, the study of Hewitt et al[13] showed that patients receiving cholecalciferol were prescribed less calcium carbonate than controls. The present randomized study confirms that cholecalciferol, given at physiologic doses, triggers 1,25(OH)2D synthesis in maintenance HD patients. This finding is in contrast to the absence of a 1,25(OH)2D level increase in anephric patients receiving physiologic doses of cholecalciferol.[34,35] Together, these obser- vations support residual renal 1a-hydroxylase activ- ity rather than extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)2D. In our opinion, a challenge with 25(OH)D could precede the prescription of 1a-hydroxylated forms of vitamin D that are more expensive and asso- ciated with a higher risk of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Considering the open-label phase of the study, our results show that the repletion protocol based on the NKF-KDOQI guidelines resulted in a sig- nificant reduction in the prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency. However, the treatment goal stated in the same guidelines (25[OH]D . 30 ng/dL) was not reached. Our own repletion protocol yielded a higher proportion of patients within the 25(OH)D target. During the whole study, the only significant change in bone and mineral metabolism biological parame- ters observed was a significant decrease in fetuin A levels. Considering that current published reports are conflicting,[36,37] further investigations are needed. In clinical practice, the choice of a vitamin D preparation is restricted by national market availabil- ity. However, calciferols should not be regarded as interchangeable.[38,39] In healthy individuals, adminis- tration of cholecalciferol gives rise to higher and more sustained 25(OH)D serum concentrations and is considered to be at least 2 times more potent than ergocalciferol. By giving cholecalciferol in doses quantitatively identical to ergocalciferol doses recom- mended by the NKF-KDOQI guidelines, we expected to have overestimated their effects. We suggest, as have others, that vitamin D dosing should be recon- sidered with regard to the NKF-KDOQI goal.[40-42]
 To conclude, our work emphasizes that physio- logic doses of cholecalciferol affect various mineral and bone biochemical parameters among mainte- nance HD patients. These effects are likely to be


#### based on residual renal 1a-hydroxylation of vitamin D compounds rather than activity in extrarenal sites. The present study did not directly test the impact of vitamin D repletion on hard clinical end points during long-term follow-up. However, it raised striking observations concerning fracture and fall rates that merit testing in larger randomized controlled studies.
