**OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of targeted exercise training and vitamin D**
supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls among older women.

**DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled**
vitamin D and open exercise trial conducted between April 2010 and March 2013 in Tampere,
Finland. Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion
criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no
contraindication to exercise.

**INTERVENTIONS Four study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d)**
without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.

**MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious**
falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In
addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and
vitamin D metabolism were assessed.

**RESULTS Intent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls.**
Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without
exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study
groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively.
Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D
(0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D
maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly.
However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance
exercise effects on physical functioning.

alls are the leading cause of unintentional injuries and
fractures in older adults. Although less than 1 in 10 falls
results in a fracture, approximately 20% of falls lead to

# F

injury requiring medical attention.[1] Therefore, fall prevention is widely considered the most essential element in injuryandfracturepreventionprogramsinelderlypopulations.[2,3]

There is strong high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials and subsequent systematic reviews and metaanalyses that regular strength and balance training can reduce the risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults by
15% to 50%.[4,5]

Vitamin D, in turn, is known to be vital for bone metabolism and health. Insufficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25[OH]D) levels are associated with increased bone loss and
risk of fractures as well as increased fall rates. Furthermore,
it has been suggested that those with low 25(OH)D levels
have lower physical performance and greater declines in
physical functioning.[6,7] However, systematic reviews and
meta-analyses of clinical trials exploring the role of vitamin
D in reducing falls and fractures in community-dwelling
older people and in improving physical functioning are
inconclusive.[8-11]

The aim of this study was to investigate the separate and
combined effects of multimodal exercise training and vitaminDsupplementationinreducingfallsandinjuriousfallsand
fallers as well as to assess their effects in improving bone density and physical functioning among older women at risk for
falling.

### Methods

#### Trial Design
This study was a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled vitamin D and open exercise intervention trial with 4 arms
(Figure 1). The trial was performed between April 2010 and
March 2013. Eligibility criteria and recruitment of participantshavebeendescribedindetailpreviously.[12] Briefly,homedwelling women 70 to 80 years old living in Tampere, Finland, were eligible if they had fallen at least once during the
previous 12 months, did not use vitamin D supplements, and
had no contraindications to exercise. Individuals who participated in moderate to vigorous exercise more than 2 hours per
week were excluded from the study.
The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland
(approval R09090). The study protocol can be found in the
trial protocol in Supplement 1. Each participant provided
written informed consent before randomization. The study
protocol is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier
NCT00986466).

#### Setting and Participants
In total, 409 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4
groups using a computer-generated list based on simple randomization with random allocation sequence to ensure equal
group sizes. The groups were (1) placebo without exercise,

(2) vitamin D (800 IU/d) without exercise, (3) placebo and exercise, and (4) vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise.
Participants received one daily pill containing 800 IU
(20 μg) of vitamin D3 or placebo for 24 months (trial protocol
in Supplement 1).[12] All tablets were provided by Oy Verman
Ab (Kerava, Finland) and were similar in size, appearance,
and taste. Each participant received a pack of pills for 6
months at a time. Used packs were returned at the time of
laboratory measurements every 6 months, and new full
packs were given. The compliance was confirmed by pill
counts.
Exercise consisted of supervised, progressive group training classes 2 times a week for the first 12 months and once a
week for the remaining 12 months of the 24-month intervention (trial protocol in Supplement 1).[12] Training periods alternatingbetweenexercisehallandgymclasseswereledbyphysiotherapists (R.P. and S.K.), who also monitored attendance.
Exercise hall classes focused on balance challenging, weight
bearing, strengthening, agility, and functional exercises. Gym
classes included a combination of pin-loaded weight machines, pulleys, and free weights, beginning with 30% to 60%
of one repetition maximum and progressing to a target level
of 60% to 75% of one repetition maximum. Exercise intensity
was estimated in metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) every 8
weeks (version 3.0.1.0; Firstbeat Technologies). The exercisers also had a home-training program (5-15 minutes), modified from the supervised exercises, to be performed on all rest
days. The nonexercising groups were asked to maintain their
prestudy level of physical activity.

#### Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Secondary
outcomes included injurious falls, the number of fallers and
injured fallers, bone density, and physical functioning (muscle
strength, balance, and mobility).
Thenumberoffallswasobtainedfromprospectivefalldiaries returned monthly via mail, and details of each registered
fall were ascertained by a telephone call. A fall was defined as
“an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest
on the ground, floor or lower level.”[13(p1619)] Injurious falls were
those for which participants sought medical care (nurse, physician, or hospital) and included injuries such as bruises, abrasions, contusions, sprains, fractures, and head injuries. Less
injuriousfallsforwhichmedicaltreatmentwasnotsoughtwere
not included in the analysis.

#### Data Collection
All measurements were obtained at baseline, 12 months, and
24 months. Blood samples and physical functioning were also
assessed at 6 months and 18 months. Assessors were blinded
to group assignments.
Body height and weight were measured with standard
methods. Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire.[14]

Body composition and areal bone mineral density (BMD)
ofthelumbarspineandleftproximalfemurwereassessedusing
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy Advance; GE
Healthcare).[15] Distal site (5%) and the mid-diaphysis (50%) of


the tibia were assessed with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (XCT 3000; Norland/Stratec).[16]

Physical functioning was assessed by the Short Physical
Performance Battery,[17] which comprised static balance, 4-m
normal walking speed, and 5-time chair stand tests and by the
Timed Up and Go (TUG) test.[18] Dynamic balance was assessed using backward walking.[19] Maximal isometric leg extensor strength at a knee angle of 110° was measured by a strain
gauge dynamometer (custom made; Tamtron). Each participant recorded her daily steps with a pedometer (HJ-112-E; Omron) over the entire 24-month study period. All tests are regularly used in our laboratory and have good reproducibility.

#### Analysis of 25(OH)D and Parathyroid Hormone Levels
Fasting serum 25(OH)D level was measured as a marker of vitamin D metabolism with an immunoenzymometric assay
(Octeia; IDS). Reproducibility was ensured by adhering to the
Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS; http:
//deqas.kpmd.co.uk). The laboratory received the DEQAS proficiency certificate in 2012. Interassay variation was avoided
bymeasuringallsamplesfromthesameindividualsinthesame
series. Serum intact parathyroid hormone was measured with
anautomatedimmunoassay(Immuliate1000;SiemensHealthcare Diagnostics).

#### Randomization and Blinding
The participants were enrolled by the corresponding author.
The study statistician (K.T.) generated the participant list
using validated randomization software. He was blinded to
the study participants and their characteristics and randomly allocated them into 4 groups (simple randomization).
The participants and study personnel were blinded to the
vitamin D treatment group assignments. The randomization
codes were opened after the data collection was completed
and checked.

#### Statistical Analysis
Power calculations indicated that a sample size of 260 (130
exercisers and 130 nonexercisers) would have an 80% power
to detect a 30% between-group difference in the rate of falls
during the 2-year intervention with a significance level of
α = .05. However, to eliminate the role of chance in detecting the possible interaction of vitamin D and exercise, 400
participants (100 in each group) were recruited into the
study.
All data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Follow-up times for falls, fallers and injurious falls, and injured
fallers were calculated from the beginning to the end of the
24-month intervention unless the participant withdrew from
the study or died. Pairwise multiple comparisons with Sidak
adjustment were first used to test the differences among treatment groups and interaction between vitamin D and exercise.Sidakadjustmentenablesthesimultaneouspairwisecomparison of multiple groups.
Fall incidence rates were calculated as the total number
of falls divided by the time over which falls were monitored
(100 person-years) in each group. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios for falls and

injurious falls. Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to calculate hazard ratios for fallers and injured fallers in each group, with the placebo without exercise group as

For physical functioning and bone traits, between-group
differences in time were estimated by linear mixed models
for normally distributed outcomes and by generalized linear
mixed models with gamma distribution and log link function for nonnormally distributed outcomes using age,
height, weight, and the use of hormone therapy as covariates. These methods allowed the incorporation of incomplete longitudinal data into the analysis. All statistical analyses were conducted using a software program (SPSS, version
22; IBM).

Thirty-nine women (9.5%) did not complete the end point
measurements, with most citing health reasons, and 4 women
died (Figure 1). The mean pill compliance was 98.1% (range,
42.6%-100%), while the mean exercise compliance (measured as attendance at all offered training sessions for group
and home training) was 72.8% (range, 0%-97.4%) and 66.1%
(0%-100%), respectively. The mean intensity of supervised
training ranged from 1.6 METs (stretching or resting) to 5.6
METs. Individual maximal values were more than 7 METs.
In general, the training program was well tolerated. There
were no severe adverse effects or injuries due to the training.
Twenty-two participants from the exercise groups and 1 participant from the nonexercise groups consulted the attending physician (P.K.) because of musculoskeletal complaints,
mainly mild overuse symptoms (eTable in Supplement 2). In
addition, 3 injuries occurred during the gym training. Three
exercisers withdrew from training during the first weeks of the
program because of preexisting osteoarthritic symptoms.
Vitamin D levels differed significantly between the vitamin D and placebo groups. The mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D levels remained stable in the placebo groups at 27.5 (7.4) ng/mL
at baseline and 27.5 (6.9) ng/mL at 24 months, with small seasonal variation, while the mean (SD) levels increased in the vitamin D groups from 25.1 (6.9) ng/mL at baseline to 37.0 (7.4)
ng/mL at 24 months (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2) (to convert
serum25[OH]Dleveltonanomolesperliter,multiplyby2.496).
Small seasonal variations were observed in serum intact parathyroid hormone in the placebo groups, while that in the vitamin D groups declined slightly from baseline, remaining
stable thereafter.
No interaction was found between vitamin D and exercise. In total, there were 928 falls and 281 fallers, with no between-group differences (the rate of falls is summarized in
Table 2). However, hazard ratios for injured fallers were lower
in both exercise groups compared with the placebo without
exercise group. Hazard ratios were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.23-0.99) for
the placebo and exercise group and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17-0.83) for
the vitamin D and exercise group. The vitamin D without exercise group did not differ from the placebo without exercise
group (Figure 2). Results were similar for the incidence rate ratios of injurious falls (Table 2). The numbers of multiple fallers (n = 190) and multiple injured fallers (n = 117) were distributed similarly across the groups.
During the intervention, femoral neck BMD declined in all
groups, but the mean decline was greatest in the placebo with

out exercise group and differed significantly from that in all
otherstudygroups(Table3).LumbarspineBMDdidnotchange

The mean (SD) number of daily steps was 5930 (2512) over
the entire study period, with no between-group differences.
Individual daily steps ranged from 1200 to 16 500.
Changes in physical functioning are summarized in Table 3
and eFigure 2 in Supplement 2. Normal walking speed was

the placebo without exercise group (P = .007), while decliningsimilarlyinothergroups.Chairstandtimeimprovedinboth
exercise groups, showing more than 6% improvement compared with the placebo without exercise group but reaching
statistical significance only in the placebo and exercise group
(P = .03). The TUG time deteriorated significantly more in the
vitamin D without exercise group compared with the placebo
without exercise group (P = .01). Other groups did not differ
from the placebo without exercise group. Backward walking
improved significantly among exercisers. The difference compared with the placebo without exercise group was statistically significant in the placebo and exercise group (P = .001)
and in the vitamin D and exercise group (P = .03). Irrespective of vitamin D, exercise increased muscle strength, while
vitamin D alone had no effect. The predicted mean increase
in lower limb extension strength was almost 15% in both exercise groups and differed significantly from the placebo without exercise group (P < .001).

### Discussion

This large randomized clinical trial of vitamin D and exercise showed that exercise training reduced injurious falls
among home-dwelling older women, while the rate of falls
was not affected by either treatment. Exercise improved
physical functioning but vitamin D did not (contrary to initial expectations). However, vitamin D reduced bone loss at
the femoral neck and increased trabecular density at the
distal tibia.

ages or types of vitamin D supplements used. According to
some experts, an adequate serum 25(OH)D level should be at
least 30 ng/mL,[20,21] while many guidelines consider 20 ng/mL
tobesufficient.[22] Weaimedtorecruitparticipantsfromthegeneral population regardless of vitamin D status, and serum 25
(OH)D levels were measured only after randomization.
There is also inconclusive evidence on whether vitamin
D could modulate physical functioning.[4,8] In a populationbased survey of men and women 60 years or older, a higher
25(OH)D level was associated with better neuromuscular
function.[7] Surprisingly, chair stand test performance appeared to decline at the highest 25(OH)D levels exceeding 120
nmol/L (>48 ng/mL),[7] possibly because of few observations in
the highest category. This finding needs confirmation. In trials
using high dosages of vitamin D, high 25(OH)D levels have increased the risk of falls and fractures, suggesting negative influences on balance and mobility.[23,24] Little is known about the
combined effects of vitamin D and exercise. Results of 2 pilot
studies[25,26] have suggested a positive influence. In frail elderly patients with acute hip fracture, Bischoff-Ferrari et al[9]

reported that vitamin D treatment reduced hospital readmission but not falls, whereas physiotherapy was successful in reducing falls but not hospital readmission. An effect on falls was
found in the physical therapy group, although gains in physical functioning were found only among participants adherent to the physiotherapy home program.
In the present trial, exercise training (irrespective of vitamin D supplementation) reduced injurious falls and de

creased the number of injured fallers. Apparently, this effect
was attributable to improved physical functioning. Muscle
strength and balance training has been shown to prevent falls
in community-dwelling older adults, and recent metaanalyses have confirmed that such exercise programs are effective in preventing fall-induced injuries.[3,27]

Exercise improved muscle strength, balance, and mobility except for the TUG time. Surprisingly, vitamin D seemed
to worsen the TUG time. Similarly, although normal walking
speed was maintained in both exercise groups with or without vitamin D, the vitamin D without exercise group showed
the greatest decline. Another unexpected finding was that exercisers treated with vitamin D supplementation showed consistently smaller benefits than exercisers receiving placebo.
Therefore, our results indicate that vitamin D may not improve neuromuscular function, at least when vitamin D intake is sufficient.
Despite improved physical performance, exercise conferred no effect on the overall fall rate. Recent studies[28,29] have
provided similar results. More falls have been reported among
exercisers despite improved muscle strength and physical
performance.[28] Nevertheless, in our study, the rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved among exercisers. Good physical condition may help prevent injuries during a fall, perhaps via better and safer landing techniques. This
trend fully concurs with recent meta-analyses.[3,27]

Exercise training was primarily intended to improve balance, muscle strength, and mobility rather than bone density

because limited physical capacity or comorbidities of participants were likely to restrict the intensity or type of loading
needed to strengthen bone. Nevertheless, both vitamin D
groups showed increased trabecular bone density in the tibia,
suggesting that the mean 25(OH)D levels were sufficient for a
skeletal effect (84.6% of participants in both vitamin D groups
exceeded the target level of ≥30 ng/mL).[20] Although vitamin
D and exercise (alone or in combination) could not increase
femoral neck BMD, both treatments reduced bone loss at this
clinically relevant bone site.
This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, it is
the first large randomized clinical trial with a long (2-year) duration that was double-blinded to vitamin D status, evaluating the effectiveness of vitamin D and exercise training in preventing falls and related injuries in older women. Second,
withdrawal from the study was low at only 9.5%. Third, pill
compliance was excellent, and participation in exercise training was good. Fourth, falls were assessed monthly using fall
diaries, and all reported falls were scrutinized by the investigators. Fifth, physical functioning and bone traits were comprehensively assessed. Furthermore, when planning our trial,
there was no consensus on the definition of injurious falls. In
2012, Schwenk et al[30] proposed a classification, and our definition conforms with this recommendation.
There were also limitations to our study. Because of the
fortification of fluid milk products in Finland, the baseline 25
(OH)D levels were likely too high to reveal all potential ben

eficial effects of the vitamin. It is possible that vitamin D has
greater effects on fall risk among women with vitamin D
depletion.[9,10,31] On the other hand, all participants had fallen
previously and thus were at increased risk of falling, and vitamin D supplementation is now recommended as a means to
reduce the risk of falls irrespective of baseline vitamin D levels. Although the exercise program was planned to be suitableandsafeforwomenwithmusculoskeletalproblems,itwas
challenging to reach and recruit the frailest women. In other
words, our participants were in good health and physical condition. Therefore, our results cannot be generalized to frail and
institutionalized women or to men.

### Conclusions

Given the fact that fall risk is multifactorial, exercise may be
the most effective and feasible strategy for preventing injurious falls in community-dwelling older adults replete with
vitamin D. Herein, vitamin D increased bone density slightly,
and exercise improved physical functioning. While neither
treatment reduced the rate of falling, injurious falls more
than halved among exercisers with or without vitamin D.
Our participants were vitamin D replete, with sufficient calcium intake. Future research is needed to elaborate the role
of vitamin D to enhance physical functioning in elderly
women.
