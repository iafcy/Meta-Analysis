Ca, MESE, and MESE þ Ca group was better than that in control group.
There was 1.9% and 1.7%, 2.3%, and 2.1% net profit in left femoral neck
and lumbar BMD after the treatment for 12 months in MESE and
MESE þ Ca groups. For the balance capacity, the subjects in MESE and
MESE þ Ca groups secured much better performance than those in Ca
and control group after the treatment for 12 months (P < 0.001,
P < 0.001).
The treatment of MESE exercise is the most effective for the
improvement of the symptom and indexes in postmenopausal women.
Importantly, the low attrition and the high exercise compliance indicate
that MESE exercise is safe, feasible, and well tolerated by postmenopausal women.

###### INTRODUCTION
steoporosis and related fragility fractures represent a
serious and global public health problem that is projected
## O
to increase with the aging of population.[1] Currently, it is
estimated that 1 in 3 women aged over 60 years will suffer
an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime.[2] The dominant factor
affecting bone metabolism in postmenopausal women is the
decline in estrogen secretion although other factors such as
decreased physical activity have been identified.[3,4] Hormone
replacement therapy (HRT) was the main method to prevent
osteoporosis or climacteric symptoms. Unfortunately, hormonal
replacement therapies may have serious cardiac, vascular,
hepatic adverse effects and may have an ominous impact on
carcinogenesis and endometrial.[5] So it is urgent to identify safe,
inexpensive, and widely accessible evidence-based strategies to
prevent and manage osteoporosis.
Exercise and calcium-vitamin D(Ca) are recognized as key
modifiable lifestyle factors that have been shown to be important for the prevention and management of osteoporosis, particularly in older women.[6] The current authors reported that lowfrequency (12.6 Hz and 3 mm of amplitude) vibratory exercise
using a reciprocating plate is feasible and is effective to improve
2 major determinants of bone fractures in postmenopausal
women: hip bone mineral density (BMD) and balance.[7] It
has been shown by a number of randomized controlled trials
conducted in postmenopausal women that exercise, particularly
high intensity progressive resistance training (PRT) and/or
weight-bearing impact exercise, which is supplemented with

calcium and/or vitamin D, can yield small profits (1–3%), or
decrease age-related losses in BMD at the hip and spine.[8–10]

The mechanism of effect of exercise and Ca on BMD are
different maybe because the benefit of exercise is in the sitespecific modification while Ca produces the permissive
systemic influence.[11,12] But some studies have documented
that the skeletal gains of exercise may depend on adequate
dietary calcium intakes (>1000 mg/day).[13]

Eight-section Brocade which is composed of 8 sectional
different actions is a traditional and safe physical therapy that is
widely accepted in the treatment of the disease, rehabilitation,
and sports medicine. The first 7 sections in Eight-section
Brocade have been mainly associated with the twisting action
of the body. However, the eighth stance, which is also known as
‘‘Jolt Body to Keep All Illnesses Away,’’ ‘‘Lift the Back,’’ and
‘‘Cure many Illnesses,’’ may stimulate the immune system and
enhance the power of osteogenesis by the perpendicular stress
resulting from the body gravity. According to the Chinese
medicine, belonging to the urinary bladder, urinary Bladder
Channel of Foot-Taiyang, which is attached directly to unusual
internal organ, such as the heart and the brain, may take in and
transmit the primordial essence into Wu Zang in order to
cooperate each other in physiology. Starting at the inner
canthus, urinary Bladder Channel of Foot-Taiyang goes up to
the vertex of the head. Its straightforward channel goes from the
vertex into the skull to connect with the brain before returning
downward and branching off at the nape. Then it goes along
both sides of the vertebral column to the waist, connects with the
kidney, and belongs to the urinary bladder. It goes further
downward, through the buttocks, to enter the middle of the
knee hollow. Its another branch goes downward from the
internal margin of the shoulder blade and, through the buttocks,
converges with the above-mentioned branch at the middle of the
knee hollow. There it goes still downward, past the back of
lower leg, along the lateral insept to the tip of the small toe. At
the same time, the eighth gesture may relieve pain by promoting
the physiological activities of urinary Bladder Channel of FootTaiyang, and clearing up the channel in the lower extremity and
lumbar spinal cord.[14] However, there are no data on the effect of
the Eight-section Brocade on the osteoporosis. The present
study aimed to observe the effects of the modified eighth section
of Eight-section Brocade (MESE) therapy on bone mass in
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.

###### METHODS

 Ethical Issues and Setting
A total of 383 outpatients, including postmenopausal
women, were studied from Liuzhou traditional Chinese Medical
Hospital (221) and Guangzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese
Medicine (162) during the period of March 2009 to March 2013,
with informed consent under institutional review boardapproved protocols, which includes purposes and procedures
of the study. The research was approved by the Institute
Research Medical Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial
Hospital, Guangzhou, China.

###### Inclusion Criteria
The BMD in the L2 to L4 and hip was identified in women
with inadequate bone mass or osteoporosis, the diagnosis of
which was based on the 1994 criteria of the World Health
Organization. Spine, hip, spine, or wrist osteoporosis of women
with BMD < –2.5 SD (T score < �2.5) should be defined,


compared to normal healthy young women. And the postmenopausal women without the traumatic fracture in any sites and
typical menopausal symptoms would like to participate in this
experiment as volunteers, aged from 50 to 75 years.

###### Exclusion Criteria
Exclude were women with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, women with blood pressure higher than
160/110 mmHg on medication, women with systolic blood
pressure less than 90 mmHg, women with heart stents or body
implantation, women with a history of thrombosis within the
past 6 months, women unrehabilitated from surgical operation,
women which have been treated with drugs for osteoporosis or
other agents which affect bone metabolism, women unrecovered from muscle strain joint injuries or fractures, women with
symptoms of vertigo and in poor health, women with spinal
nerve canal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or lumbar disc herniation, and women with epileptics.

###### Grouping
This 2 � 2 factorial design study was a 12-month randomized controlled trial. The 2 factors were MESE exercise and Ca,
each tested on 2 levels so that the women who met the inclusion
criteria and had no contraindications were randomly allocated to
1 of 4 groups, a control group (n ¼ 48); Ca alone (n ¼ 50);
MESE exercise alone (n ¼ 50); MESE þ Ca (n ¼ 50) (Figure 1).
Of the 198 women, 184 completed the 12-month experiment. In
control group, 6 were lost, because of serious back pain (n ¼ 3),
traumatic fracture (n ¼ 2), and sudden heart attack (n ¼ 1). In Ca
group, 45 completed the experiment and 5 lost, including 2 lost
the treatment of constipation, 2 was due to medication for
serious back pain, the others left one failed to traumatic fracture.
In MESE group, 48 women completed and 2 defaulted on the
experiment, including one lost the treatment of sudden heart
attack, the other were due to traumatic fracture. In MESE þ Ca
group, only 1 defaulted on the experiment for constipation.

###### Treatment Methods
Participants in Ca group (n ¼ 50) were asked to consume
Calcium Carbonate Chewable D3 tablet (500 mg of calcium and
200 IU of vitamin D3, thrice daily) (GE Healthcare, Shanghai,
China) for 12 months. Patients in MESE group (n ¼ 50) were
given exercise of MESE by 7 repetitions per time, thrice daily.
Subjects in MESE þ Ca group (n ¼ 50) performed such the
combined treatment project for 12 months.

###### Test Indicators
Chronic back pain was evaluated by visual analogue scale
(VAS) at the baseline, the 3rd week, the 6th month, and the 12th
month of the treatment. The BMD at L2 to L4 and the left
femoral neck of all subjects was determined before the start of
the treatment and at the 12th month of treatment respectively
(dual-energy bone densitometers, M2428, the Medlink Corporation, France).

###### The Modified Eighth Section of Eight-Section Brocade (MESE)
The modified eighth section of Eight-Section Brocade also
called ‘‘jolt the back 7 times’’ is introduced below.
Stand up straight (the older or the weak may lean on the
wall). The toes should be pointed straight ahead, with the feet
parallelly apart to one’s shoulders width and one’s knees slightly

bent to 135�1708. One’s arms should hang down in a relaxed
manner at one’s sides. Relax one’s body for 2 minutes. Stay
balanced and centered. Clear one’s mind and set aside the work
and worries of the day. One’s face should seem happy, joyful,
reflecting an ‘‘Inner Smile.’’ Keep one’s head up and look
forward. One’s eyes should be open, with a soft and wide angle
focus. Breathe in and out in a relaxed, easy, and regular manner.
Keep one’s lips parted slightly. Next, raising slowly 2 arms and
one’s heels to the highest with the palm downwards as you
slowly deeply inhale. Then, both one’s arms and heels fall under
gravity after holding one’s breath for 5 to 10 seconds. Finally,
the waist lightly vibrates as soon as one’s heels downcasts to
touch the ground. Subsequently, one’s legs slowly squats down
and one’s knees slightly bent to 135�1708 with exhaling slowly
deeply. Repeat steps above. Work up to get up to 7 repetitions.

###### Bone and Body Composition
BMD was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) at the lumbar spine (L2–L4) and left proximal femur on
the nondominant side, using the standard protocol. All analyses
have been carried out by the same investigation in order to
minimize interobserved variation.


Body height was measured by weighing scales. Both knees
function was measured by Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS)
knee score.

###### Balance and Motility Performance Measures
Participants were undertaken 2 kinds of balance tests:
3-feet Up and Go Test (3[0]UG) and one-leg Stance (OLS). At
first, each subject remained seated and rested for 5 minutes
before the test. The score of 3[0]UG test which were measured to
the nearest one-tenth of a second, were recorded as the shortest
time from the seated position, walking 3 ms, then turning, and
returning to the starting point.
In OLS tests, each subject should stand up straight as
possible as in a unipedal posture on the floor with the eye open,
head upright, arms relaxed by the side of the body. The score
was equivalent to the time from the moment 1 foot was raised
from the ground to when it touched the floor or the standing leg.
The longer time it stood, the better balance ability was. And the
maximum time was 45 seconds. Participant could perform twice
OLS tests, with the rest for 1 minute between 2 attempts. And
the best performance was recorded as OLS score.

###### Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). Baseline characteristics between
the groups were compared using analysis of variance. The
one-way ANOVA test was used for comparing groups, and
the Bonferroni post hoc test was used for multiple comparisons
when ANOVA was significant. Before and after treatment
values of variables in each group were analyzed with paired
t-test. Descriptive data were calculated for the study sample and
presented as means � standard deviation (SD). The smaller Pvalues than 0.05 are considered to be statistically significant.

###### RESULTS

 Recruitment
Fourteen of 198 women (7.1%) withdrew from the study
over the 12-month period (Control, n ¼ 6; Ca, n ¼ 5; MESE,
n ¼ 2; MESE þ Ca, n ¼ 1). The reasons for the withdrawal
included: constipation related to the study (n ¼ 3), the serious
back pain (n ¼ 5), the fracture (n ¼ 4), and illness unrelated to
the study (n ¼ 2). The average compliance with the calcium D3
program was 90%, and did not differ between the MESE þ Ca
(98%) and Ca alone group. The average compliance with MESE
was 96% and was no different between the MESE þ Ca and
MESE groups (Figure 1).

###### Subject Characteristics
Demographics and descriptive parameters of the subjects
are listed in Table 1. On average, participants suffered from the
similar pain level, lumbar BMD, and left femoral neck. There
were no significant between-group differences in baseline
characteristics, including age, menopausal years, VAS, LBMD, F-BMD, 3[0]UG, OLS, Height, and HSS among the four
groups (all P > 0.05). The average dietary calcium intake for all
participants was 1.5 g/day. And no participants had severe
vitamin D deficiency.

###### Compliance with Intervention and Adverse Events
There were no serious injuries or adverse events associated
with exercises. The limited number of minor injuries included
the exacerbation of the knee or hip pain (n ¼ 2, both are able to
continue with exercise after program modification), lower back
injury (n ¼ 1, 1 recovered with 1-week rest).

TABLE 1. Baseline Characteristics of the 3 Groups (Mean � SD)


###### Pain Visual Analogue Scale Scores
After the treatment for 3 weeks, it has been more effective
for Ca, MESE, and MESE þ Ca to alleviate patient’s back pain,
compared to control group. But there has been no the significant
difference for VAS in Ca group from 6 months to 12 months
(P > 0.05). Within-group analysis revealed that VAS at each
time point decreased significantly in MESE and MESE þ Ca
groups relative to control group. And the improvement in
chronic back pain of the patients in group MESE þ Ca and
group MESE was better than that in group Ca after the treatment
for 12 months (P < 0.05, P < 0.001; Figure 2). In addition, with
the prolongation of the time, the VAS of chronic back pain of
the patients in group MESE þ Ca and group MESE was lower
than that both in control and in Ca group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001).
So it is effective for MESE exercise to alleviate patient’s pain.

###### Bone Mineral Density
BMD measured by DXA offers sufficient precision to
follow disease progression and is currently the best-validated
technology for showing a response to therapy. So the effect of
Ca, MESE exercise, MESE þ Ca on left femoral neck and
lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis were
assessed after the treatment for 12 months. MESE resulted in a
significant 1.9% net gain in left femural neck BMD relative to
control after 12 months (P < 0.001; Figure 3A). Similar results
were observed in MESE þ Ca groups (2.3%). For left femural
neck BMD, there was a significant 1.4% to 1.9% within-group
increase in both exercise groups. But the BMD in MESE þ Ca
group significantly increased than BMD in MESE group
(P < 0.05; Figure 3A). Maybe MESE exercise facilitated the
absorption of Calcium in human body. Comparable results were
observed for lumbar spine (L2–L4) BMD, and there was a
significant net 1.7% to 2.1% increase in BMD in all 3 treatment
groups compared to the control group. In the subsequent per
protocol analysis, the exercise main effects remained significant
at lumbar BMD in MESE and MESE þ Ca groups (P < 0.001,
P < 0.001; Figure 3B), and between-group differences in favor
of the exercise group were also detected at lumbar spine (L2–
L4) (P < 0.001; Figure 3B). And there was no the significant
difference about the lumbar BMD in both MESE and
MESE þ Ca groups after the treatment for 12 months
(P > 0.05; Figure 3B). This is likely due to the significant
1.0% within-group increase in lumbar BMD in Ca alone group.
So MESE exercise resulted in the main effect on BMD.

(n ¼ 42), Ca (n ¼ 45), MESE (n ¼ 48), MESE þ Ca (n ¼ 49) groups
at baseline and after the treatment for 3 weeks, 6 months, and 12
months. MESE exercise and MESE þ Ca resulted in significant
decreases in VAS relative to both baseline and control group.
Data are presented as means � SE (all P < 0.05, AVON).


###### Change in Balance Capacity
After the treatment for 3 weeks, we observed that there
were no significant difference for 3[0]UG test in Ca, MESE, and
MESE þ Ca groups, compared to control group (P > 0.05;
Figure 4). But the subjects in MESE and MESE þ Ca groups
secured much better performance than those in control group
after the treatment for 6 to 12 months (P < 0.001, P < 0.001;
Figure 4). And there was no significant difference between Ca
and control groups (P > 0.05; Figure 4). And subjects in MESE
and MESE þ Ca groups made the greater improvement by 0.87
and 1.17 seconds decrease in 3[0]UG test, relative to ones in
control group (Figure 4). Meanwhile, it has been illustrated in
Figure 4 that there was a significant 0.57 and 0.87 seconds
decrease for 3[0]UG in MESE and MESE þ Ca groups, compared
to that in the Ca group.
In OLS test, the length of participation in Ca, MESE, and
MESE þ Ca therapy was significantly longer 1.75, 2.23, and
3.21 seconds than control group after the treatment for 3 weeks
(P < 0.05, P < 0.001, P < 0.001; Figure 5). All the more, there
was a significant 0.48 and 1.46 seconds increase in MESE and
MESE þ Ca group, compared to Ca group (P < 0.05, P < 0.05,
P < 0.05; Figure 5). And with the prolongation of medication,
the more evident was it for MESE exercise to improve the
balance capacity (P < 0.001; Figures 4 and 5). So at 12 months,
the time for OLS test in MESE and MESE þ Ca groups got up to
32.6 and 35.1 seconds (Figure 5). And there was the significant
difference in 3[0]UG and OLS tests between MESE and
MESE þ Ca group after the treatment for 3 weeks to 12 months
(P < 0.05, P < 0.05; Figures 4 and 5). At the same time, it has
been demonstrated in Figure 4 that the performance of Ca group
for 3[0]UG is not significantly changed by the treatment from
calcium for 3 weeks to 12 months. So maybe the traditional
calcium intakes only increased the time of OLS test, and MESE
exercise may not only extend the time of OLS but also enhance
the velocity of 3[0]UG.

###### Body Height and HSS Scores of Both Knees
There were no difference existing among the body height
and HSS scores of both knees in 3 groups, compared to those in
control group. Table 2 shows the results for the body height and

was significantly greater than the increases in Ca group
(P < 0.001). (B) Mean-adjusted percentage change (95% CI) in

a significant main effect of MESE exercise (P < 0.001).

HSS scores after the treatment for 12 months. MESE and/or Ca
cannot significantly enhance the body height and improve the
HSS scores of both knees.

###### DISCUSSION
The main findings of the present study were that the
treatment of MESE exercise was the most effective for lowering
VAS, increasing the left femoral neck and lumbar BMD and
balance in posture, which are associated with the increased bone
fragility and higher risk of fracture. However, we also observed
that only supplementation with 1500 mg of calcium and 600 IU
of vitamin D3 per day cannot enhance the 3[0]UG, the left femoral
BMD, which is consistent with the earlier results.[2] At the same

different intervention periods. With the prolongation of the time,
MESE exercise and MESE þ Ca treatment have significantly

time, there are no significant difference for the effect between
MESE and MESE þ Ca groups on the lumbar BMD. So it is
very effective for MESE to meliorate the symptoms and indexes
on osteoporosis.
In many studies, several lines of evidence have been shown
that the exercise training plays the important role in the prevention of osteoporosis via development as well as maintenance
of BMD.[15,16] Based on the findings of a serial of basic animal
research, the theory of practical exercise application has
formed.[17,18] Robling think that it is effective for an exercise
regime to improve parameters of bone strength dependent on the
known reactivity of bone cells and tissue to all kinds of load,
which has been referred as the osteogenic index (OI).[19]

Although the prolonged training stimuli has desensitized animal
bone tissues, the bone response to a cyclical stimulus could been
markedly improved by adding rest periods between bouts of
loading.[20] And the bone response to training varies along with
nature of the activity, diet, reproductive hormone status, and the
different function of skeletal age. Certainly, the practical goal of
an exercise intervention does not merely lie in increasing bone
mass, but in reducing the incidence of fracture.[21] Although it is
very effective for highly intense and explosive exercise to
stimulate the osteogenesis, this kind of training which has
not been recommended for the older man or the patient with
osteoporosis, not only impose an additional burden on the

different intervention periods. MESE exercise and MESE þ Ca
resulted in the increase of the length of participation in OLS,
compared with the baseline and control (P < 0.001, P < 0.001).

circulatory system, but also tend to result in the specific
fracture. So the modified eighth section of eight-sectioned
brocade has spontaneously complied with the principle of
individual, such as the choice of the strength and length of
participation in exercise based on their own specific condition
of the older person, including the change of individual’s bone
mass, the degree of the seriousness, and the fracture.
The length of participation in weight-loading exercise may
be an important consideration for exercise programming in
older adults. No change in femoral neck bone mass was
observed in postmenopausal women following 9 months of
jump plus resistance exercise wearing weighted vests.[22] A study
on the associations of physical activity, body mass index and
BMD in 6442 women found that 5 years of participation in
physical activity is associated with a small increase in total hip
BMD.[23] In our study, the length of the time for the loadingweight, such as the posture of the squat and the tiptoe, was based
on the individual’s specific condition. And there was 1.9% and
1.7%, 2.3%, and 2.1% net profit in left femoral neck and lumbar
BMD after the treatment for 12 months in MESE and
MESE þ Ca groups. Likewise, MESE exercise resulted in the
decrease of the time in the 3[0]UG test, consistently, improved the
balance capacity. It is possible that the delayed response is a
function of mineralization, a process known to continue long
after new bone tissue (osteoid) has been secreted by osteoblasts.

Exercise may obviously accelerate the blood circulation in
the whole body and the skeleton. At the same time, the contraction and relaxation of the muscle may also stimulate the
osteogenesis. In turn, those may prevent and decelerate the
process of osteoporosis development. It has been commonly
accepted that the participation in moderate physical activity
stimulates the osteogenesis to the bones,[24] by enhancing serum
concentration of bone formation marker[25–29] as well as bone
resorption markers.[30–32] Eight-section Brocade is a kind of
popular exercise to maintain good health, fight disease, and
enhance the quality of life in China. The eighth section of Eightsection Brocade, which has been known as the tiptoe posture,
may stimulate the immune system and enhance the power of
osteogenesis by the perpendicular stress resulting from the body
gravity. But the modified eighth section of eight-sectioned
brocade has included 2 training exercise, such as the tiptoe
and the swat stance. For the latter, has been recommended by
American Sports Association as the position which contributes
to prevent the osteoporosis. And when the heel has suddenly
been put down, the gravity from the body strikes the ground,
which produces the reaction propulsion, in turn, which has
resulted in the vibration of the body. However, vibration
exercise nowadays has been broadly available to exerciser
and patient.[33] So in fact, Our MESE has been composed of 3
kinds of exercise. So MESE exercise is the most effective for the
improvement of the symptom and indexes in postmenopausal
women.

###### CONCLUSIONS
Our study reported greater improvement in the MESE and
MESE þ Ca group. We found that the treatment of MESE
exercise was the most effective for alleviating the chronic pain,
increasing the left femoral neck and lumbar BMD and balance
in posture, which are associated with the increased bone fragility and higher risk of fracture. Importantly, the low attrition
and exercise compliance coupled with the low number of
adverse events indicates that this type of exercise program is
safe, feasible, and well tolerated by previously untrained, but
otherwise healthy older men.
Certainly, clearly more research is needed in order to better
understand the specific therapeutic potential of MESE as an
exercise model. Moreover, there seems to be a certain need for
studies to assess any potential long-term risks. However, with
appropriate introduction to the exercise modality, MESE exercise seems to be reasonably safe for most people.
