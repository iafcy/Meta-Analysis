#### Abstract

**Background: survivors of hip fracture are at 5- to 10-fold risk of a second hip fracture. There is little consensus about**
secondary prevention. Many are given calcium and vitamin D, but the evidence supporting this is circumstantial.
**Objective: to compare the effects of different calcium and vitamin D supplementation regimens on bone biochemical markers,**
bone mineral density and rate of falls in elderly women post-hip fracture.
**Design: randomised controlled trial.**
**Setting: orthogeriatric rehabilitation ward.**


-----

**Methods: 150 previously independent elderly women, recruited following surgery for hip fracture, were assigned to receive a**
single injection of 300,000 units of vitamin D2, injected vitamin D2 plus 1 g/day oral calcium, 800 units/day oral vitamin D3
plus 1 g/day calcium, or no treatment. Follow-up was one year, with measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid
hormone, bone mineral density, and falls.
**Results: mean 25-hydroxyvitamin D increased and mean parathyroid hormone was suppressed in all the actively treated**
groups, more so in the group receiving combined oral vitamin D and calcium. Twenty per cent of participants injected with
vitamin D were deWcient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D a year later. Bone mineral density showed small but statistically signiWcant differences of up to 4.6% between actively treated groups and placebo. Relative risk of falling in the groups supplemented with
vitamin D was 0.48 (95% CI 0.26–0.90) compared with controls.
**Conclusion: Vitamin D supplementation, either orally or with injected vitamin D, suppresses parathyroid hormone,**
increases bone mineral density and reduces falls. Effects may be more marked with calcium co-supplementation. The
300,000 units of injected vitamin D may not last a whole year.

#### Introduction

Hip fractures are the most serious osteoporotic fractures,
with high mortality, and decreased mobility and increased
dependency in survivors [1–3]. Moreover, survivors are at
5–10-fold increased risk of fracturing their other hip compared to subjects of similar age [4, 5]. Despite this, there is
little consensus over secondary prevention [6, 7]. Oral calcium
and vitamin D are often given, on the basis of the high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in elderly people [8–11], and its
efWcacy in the primary prevention of hip fractures amongst
frail elderly people [12]. However, these oral preparations
come as large tablets, and polypharmacy can be a problem for
elderly people. An alternative strategy is to give annual injections of 300,000 units of vitamin D, which could, for example, be delivered conveniently at the same time as inXuenza
vaccination. Some evidence, albeit incomplete, supports the
bone-protective effects of injected vitamin D [13].
We recently described ‘functional hypoparathyroidism’ –
a failure to mount a secondary hyperparathyroid response
to hypovitaminosis D – in about half of elderly women with
hypovitaminosis D after hip fracture [8]. In this study we
describe the effects of different calcium and vitamin D
supplementation strategies on calcium homeostasis, bone
mineral density (BMD) and falls, compared with no treatment,
in the same population.

#### Methods

**Participants**

Participants were recruited over an 18-month period from a
‘fast-track’ orthogeriatric rehabilitation ward, within 7 days
of surgery for a hip fracture. The main criteria for referral to
the ward speciWed previous community residence, and independence in activities of daily living (ADL). Institutionalised
patients were excluded from the study, as were patients with
diseases or medication known to affect bone metabolism,
and those with a 10-point abbreviated mental test score [14]
less than seven at the time of recruitment. Two hundred and
eight women were invited to participate of whom 150
initially agreed. Fifty-eight declined, mainly through family
members considering it inappropriate to include frail elderly


people in a research project. Fifteen patients were not eligible
for invitation according to the exclusion criteria (six cognitive
impairment, nine on medication affecting bone metabolism).
All subjects underwent a baseline medical examination, biochemical tests and bone densitometry. The protocol was
approved by the university hospital ethics committee and all
patients gave written, witnessed, informed consent.

**Randomisation**

Participants were randomised to four treatment groups,
from computer-generated random number lists, using sealed,
opaque, envelopes. Groups were assigned to receive a single
injection of 300,000 units of vitamin D2 [ergocalciferol];
injected vitamin D2 plus oral calcium carbonate (Calcichew,
one tablet twice daily, providing 1 g/day elemental calcium);
combined oral vitamin D3 and calcium carbonate tablets
(Calceos 1 tablet twice daily, providing vitamin D3 [cholecalciferol] 800 units/day and 1 g/day elemental calcium); or
no treatment. Placebos were not used. Participants’ general
practitioners were asked to avoid prescribing vitamin D or
other osteoporosis drugs during the follow-up period.

**Follow up**

Patients were seen in a dedicated clinic 3, 6 and 12 months
after their fracture. Deaths, falls and new fractures were
ascertained. Falls diaries were not used, and the researcher
was not blinded to treatment allocation. Fracture reports
were not veriWed. Biochemical measurements and BMD
were repeated after 12 months.

**Biochemical measurements**

Blood samples were taken the day following randomisation.
Standard, automated, laboratory methods were used, with
serum calcium corrected for albumin binding. Intact
parathyroid hormone (PTH) was measured by immunochemiluminometric assay [Magic Lite, Ciba Cornig Diagnostics, Gwynned, UK; normal range (NR) 12–72 ng/ml];
25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) by radioimmunoassay
(Incstar Corporation, MN, USA; NR 25–115 nmol/l). Intra
and inter-assay variances ranged between 2.5–11% and 4–8%
respectively, with all assays measured by the same technician
in batch analysis, 7 days post-fracture. Hypovitaminosis D

was deWned as a 25OHD ≤ 30 nmol/l, and secondary hyperparathyroidism as a PTH above the upper tertile of the
normal range (50 ng/ml), in the presence of hypovitaminosis D [15].

**Bone mineral density measurements**

BMD of the lumbar spine (L2–L4) and proximal femur
contralateral to the fracture was measured by dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic QDR 2000, Madison, WI,
USA) within 28 days of the fracture. Positioning of patients
during absorptiometry and data analysis were standardised
as were machine calibration and technician training. The shortterm coefWcient of variation within subjects, in this study,
calculated from two repeated measurements with re-positioning, was 1.48% at the spine and 0.99% at the total hip.

**Statistical analysis**

Descriptive baseline characteristics (proportions, means and
ranges) were determined, and a comparison made between
those with and without full data. Changes in biochemical
measurements and BMD were corrected for initial baseline
imbalances by general linear modelling regression analysis
using SPSS software. Post hoc pairwise differences between
randomisation groups were explored without correction for
multiple comparisons, as in the context type II statistical
error was as likely a potential problem as type I error. Proportions were compared with a chi-squared test, and relative
risks for deaths, falls and fractures calculated using Epi-info
software. Fisher’s exact test was used when numbers were
too small for the chi-squared test.
Analyses were repeated separately for the sub-group
with ‘functional hypoparathyroidism’ (patients with 25OHD
<30 nmol/l, but without secondary hyperparathyroidism) [8];
those who were vitamin D replete at baseline; and those
with PTH levels above the upper tertile of the normal range.

#### Results

**Patient characteristics (Table 1)**

Mean age of the subjects was 81.2 years (range 67–92 years).
Mean body mass index (BMI) was 24.2 (SD 2.9) kg/m[2]. Ten
per cent of subjects had a BMI below the lower end of the
normal range (19–26 kg/m[2]). Eighty-seven per cent of
patients were living in a house or bungalow prior to fracture
and 13% in warden-assisted accommodation. All subjects
were independent in basic ADL prior to their fracture.
Sixty-four per cent were independently mobile without the
use of any walking aids, 29% used one stick and 7% used
two sticks. Abbreviated mental test score was 10 (out of 10)
in 83%, 9 in 12% and 7 or 8 in the rest.
Participants in the four randomisation groups were
well-matched for age, smoking history, estimated dietary
calcium intake, and alcohol consumption. More subjects
in the two injected vitamin D groups had intracapsular
fracture than in the other two groups. The no treatment
group had more subjects with no previous fracture. The
groups were well-matched for mean baseline serum calcium, PTH and vitamin D, but the injected vitamin D
alone group had a higher proportion of subjects with


hypovitaminosis D. Baseline BMD was well-matched
across groups (Table 2).
Of the 150 patients recruited into the study, 28 did not
want to undergo initial BMD assessment. After a year, 29
patients had died (23%), and 21 withdrew from follow-up
(some with partial data), mostly because of difWculty in
attending the clinic. There were no cases of hypercalcaemia,
and no participants were withdrawn because of adverse
effects of study medication. One-hundred and three patients
had complete biochemical data, 97 completed BMD data,
and 87 both. Participants with complete data had slightly
better dietary calcium intake, better pre-fracture mobility,
lower mean PTH and marginally higher mean vitamin D
levels, but were otherwise similar to those with some missing
data (Table 1).
Mortality varied between 14% to 31% across the groups
(chi-squared=8, 3 df, _P_ =0.04). Amongst the groups
receiving vitamin D 27% died, compared with 14% in
the group receiving no treatment (relative risk 2.0; 95%
CI 0.8–4.7, P =0.11). Rate of falling was 18% in the vitamin
D groups, compared with 37% in the placebo group
(relative risk 0.48; 95% CI 0.3–0.9, P =0.02), and the risk of
fracturing was 7% compared with 14% (relative risk 0.50,
95% CI 0.2–1.5, _P_ =0.30), in favour of the vitamin D
groups. Numbers were too small to distinguish further
between the different vitamin D groups.
After one year of follow up mean 25OHD was much
higher and PTH levels lower in the supplemented groups
compared with no treatment. Twenty per cent of the
injected vitamin D groups were deWcient in 25OHD at one
year, compared with 63% in the placebo group (which was
unchanged from baseline). Participants in the oral combination vitamin D and calcium group had the highest 25OHD
and lowest PTH, followed by the injected vitamin D plus
oral calcium group, and the injected vitamin D group alone,
which in turn was more favourable than the no treatment
group. In post hoc comparisons, all the supplemented groups
were statistically signiWcantly different from placebo, as was
the combined oral supplementation group compared with
the injected vitamin D alone group (Table 3).
The biochemical changes were paralleled by small differences in BMD (statistically adjusted for differences at baseline)
at the hip but not the spine. These were statistically signiWcant
for the neck of femur and total hip measurements, in favour
of the vitamin D groups over the no treatment group. The
size of differences between supplemented and no treatment
groups was 1.1–3.3% at the neck of femur, 2.5–4.6% at the
trochanter and 2.1–4.6% for the total hip. Post hoc comparisons
for the total hip measurement showed all vitamin D supplemented groups to be statistically signiWcantly different from
no treatment, as was combined oral supplementation from
injected vitamin D alone (Table 3).
Results were considered separately for the subgroup of
patients with ‘functional hypoparathyroidism’ (baseline
25OHD<30 nmol/l and PTH<50 ng/ml; Table 3) [8].
Due to low numbers, all the vitamin D groups were combined. At baseline, the supplemented group had slightly
higher BMD than the no treatment group, but otherwise
they were well matched. After 12 months, mean 25OHD

had doubled in the supplemented group, but was
unchanged in the no treatment group. Twenty-six per cent
in the supplemented groups had hypovitaminosis D
(25OHD ≤ 30 nmol/l) compared with 67% in the no treatment group. Mean PTH increased slightly in both groups,
and at the end of the study there was no difference between
them. BMD changes were similar to those for the study
population as a whole. Neck of femur BMD was 2.7%
greater in the treated groups, trochanter BMD 3.2% greater,


and total hip 3.5% greater. The latter two reached statistical
signiWcance, and the former nearly so. Relative risk of falling
in the supplemented groups was 0.31 (95% CI 0.08–1.14,
_P_ =0.11) compared with the no treatment group. There
were 3 fractures, 2 (5%) in the supplemented group, and
one (11%) in the no treatment group.
Results were also similar for sub-groups which were
vitamin D replete, or who had PTH above the upper tertile
of the normal range.

#### Discussion

Our initial intention was to investigate the effect of different
calcium and vitamin D supplementation regimens on the
‘intermediate outcomes’ of markers of calcium homeostasis,
BMD and falls. We succeeded in demonstrating that
calcium and vitamin D has a measurable and beneWcial effect
on bone after one year of treatment following a hip fracture.
More surprisingly, and more perhaps importantly, we
demonstrated that the rate of falling is halved by vitamin D
supplementation, conWrming other recent evidence [16–20].
The most important outcome, fracture risk, is a function of
the risk of falling, and the force applied to the bone during
the fall, as well as bone density and architecture. Our numbers
were insufWcient to be certain, but we also observed a halving
of fracture risk.
We may have under-ascertained falls and fractures as we
did not use diaries or scrutinize case notes. This should not
have biased the study as the same methods were used for all
treatment groups, but may have reduced the statistical
power to show real differences. The study was not blinded,
and no placebos were used, for practical reasons – we were
not funded to do so. This might have introduced bias. However, most of our outcomes were objective biochemical or
BMD measurements, and a reduction in falls with vitamin
D treatment was not anticipated at the study outset, both of
which make bias less likely.
An unresolved question is whether maximal bone
effects can be achieved with vitamin D alone, or if calcium


supplementation is also required. We found that oral
calcium and vitamin D was more effective than injected
vitamin D alone. The effect of injected vitamin D plus oral
calcium was intermediate between these two, and not statistically signiWcant from either (even using liberal statistical
assumptions). About a quarter of patients given injected
vitamin D were overtly deWcient a year later, suggesting that
the injected supplement had not lasted until the time of
re-testing, which complicates interpretation of this Wnding.
Moreover, some evidence suggests that cholecalciferol
(vitamin D3) is metabolised to 25-OHD more efWciently
than ergocalciferol (vitamin D2), which would also favour
the combined oral preparation [21]. Our data are consistent
with both a requirement for additional calcium, and the sufWciency of vitamin D alone. A larger trial is required.
Our observations on the baseline data from this population showed that some elderly people fail to mount a secondary hyperparathyroid response to hypovitaminosis D – a
group we termed to have ‘functional hypoparathyroidism’

[8]. This suggested a secondary hypothesis – that patients
with functional hypoparathyroidism would not beneWt from
supplementation with unhydroxylated vitamin D, and might
instead require more activated forms of vitamin D, such as
calcitriol. The reasoning was, Wrstly, that there is no secondary hyperparathyroidism to suppress, and therefore no
increase in bone demineralisation to inhibit. Secondly, 1hydroxylation of 25-OHD to active 1,25 (OH)2 D would be
impaired, as this process is PTH-dependent. In the event,
the results for the functional hypoparathyroid group were
remarkably similar to those for the study population as a
whole. Mean PTH remained similar between vitamin D
supplemented and placebo groups, suggesting that the
entity of functional hypoparathyroidism does exist. Mean
PTH increased in both supplemented and no treatment
groups, presumably due to regression to the mean. BMD
increased to approximately the same extent in each group,
and falls risk was about halved (although, with small numbers this was statistically uncertain). Unfortunately we were
unable to measure 1,25 (OH)2 D, or other bone turnover
markers, as intermediate outcomes, for funding reasons,
and so could not directly conWrm the concern about lack of
activation of 25-OHD in functional hypoparathyroidism.
Participants who were vitamin D replete (on conventional
criteria [15]) at baseline also beneWted from supplementation, with their PTH levels being suppressed further, and
their BMD increasing.
We were surprised at the difWculty we had in both
recruiting and retaining trial participants, in particular the
vehemence with which some families objected to the inclusion of an elderly relative (who had capacity to give their
own consent, and who had freely done so). The group we
studied are at high medical risk, and stand to gain much
from effective intervention. This issue deserves further
study, and requires imaginative solutions to be found.
The high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in hip fracture patients justiWes routine supplementation, having Wrst
excluded co-incidental hypercalcaemia from another aetiology. If biochemical conWrmation is required, vitamin D
should be measured rather than relying on detecting


-----

secondary hyperparathyroidism alone. The differences in BMD
between supplemented and control groups were relatively
small (albeit over only 1 year of follow-up). Additional bone
protection, such as with bisphosphonates, may also be
justiWed. Moreover, since increased mineralisation with
bisphosphonates is uncertain in the presence of vitamin D
insufWciency, vitamin D supplementation would be wise in
any case [22, 23]. Our results suggest that the mechanism of
action of vitamin D may be independent of PTH (since
changes were also seen in patients without raised PTH levels). A mechanism of action for vitamin D, with or without
additional calcium, to reduce falls may be important. This
might be effective over a shorter time frame than bone
mineral changes.

#### Key points

- Seventy per cent of elderly women after hip fracture have
hypovitaminosis D.

- Vitamin D supplementation by annual injection or oral
tablets increases 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, suppresses
parathyroid hormone, increases bone mineral density
and reduces falls over the following year.

- It remains uncertain whether adding calcium produces
beneWts over vitamin D supplementation alone.

- Recruitment and retention of this frail group into a trial

was difWcult.
