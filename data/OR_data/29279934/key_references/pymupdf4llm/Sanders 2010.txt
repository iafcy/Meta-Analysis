HE RESULTS OF RANDOMIZED
controlled trials investigating
the effects of cholecalciferol
(vitamin D) supplementation

# Ton falls and fractures have been incon
sistent.[1-13] Some meta-analyses conclude that 700 to 800 IU of vitamin D
daily reduces fracture risk by 13% to
26%,[14-18] whereas others conclude that
vitamin D is ineffective. A Cochrane
analysis[19] and the Vitamin D Individual Patient Analysis of Randomized Trials (DIPART) group,[20] published after this study commenced,
showed a nonstatistically significant increase in hip fracture risk associated
with vitamin D supplementation.[19-21]
Studies have observed those living in
long-term care facilities as having
greater fracture risk reduction than
community-dwelling elders. Similarly, fewer fractures were observed in
participants whose study treatment was
coadministered with calcium.[4,5,16,22] Furthermore, many studies have found
treatment adherence to be low[1,2,6] and
fracture risk reduction was greater
among adherent than nonadherent pa

**Context Improving vitamin D status may be an important modifiable risk factor to re-**
duce falls and fractures; however, adherence to daily supplementation is typically poor.

**Objective To determine whether a single annual dose of 500 000 IU of cholecalcif-**
erol administered orally to older women in autumn or winter would improve adherence and reduce the risk of falls and fracture.

**Design, Setting, and Participants A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2256**
community-dwelling women, aged 70 years or older, considered to be at high risk of
fracture were recruited from June 2003 to June 2005 and were randomly assigned to
receive cholecalciferol or placebo each autumn to winter for 3 to 5 years. The study
concluded in 2008.

**Intervention 500 000 IU of cholecalciferol or placebo.**

**Main Outcome Measures Falls and fractures were ascertained using monthly cal-**
endars; details were confirmed by telephone interview. Fractures were radiologically
confirmed. In a substudy, 137 randomly selected participants underwent serial blood
sampling for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and parathyroid hormone levels.

**Results Women in the cholecalciferol (vitamin D) group had 171 fractures vs 135 in**
the placebo group; 837 women in the vitamin D group fell 2892 times (rate, 83.4 per
100 person-years) while 769 women in the placebo group fell 2512 times (rate, 72.7
per 100 person-years; incidence rate ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.02-1.30; P=.03). The incidence RR for fracture in the vitamin D group was 1.26
(95% CI, 1.00-1.59; P=.047) vs the placebo group (rates per 100 person-years, 4.9
vitamin D vs 3.9 placebo). A temporal pattern was observed in a post hoc analysis of
falls. The incidence RR of falling in the vitamin D group vs the placebo group was 1.31
in the first 3 months after dosing and 1.13 during the following 9 months (test for
homogeneity; P = .02). In the substudy, the median baseline serum 25hydroxycholecalciferol was 49 nmol/L. Less than 3% of the substudy participants had
25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels lower than 25 nmol/L. In the vitamin D group, 25hydroxycholecalciferol levels increased at 1 month after dosing to approximately 120
nmol/L, were approximately 90 nmol/L at 3 months, and remained higher than the
placebo group 12 months after dosing.

**Conclusion Among older community-dwelling women, annual oral administration**
of high-dose cholecalciferol resulted in an increased risk of falls and fractures.

tients.[1,16,22] The evidence of vitamin D
efficacy in preventing falls suggests that
daily doses of at least 700 IU reduce falls
by 19% to 26%.[23]
We hypothesized that high-dose cholecalciferol (500 000 IU) given orally
once a year to community-dwelling
older women would reduce falls and
fractures. The rationale for this dose was
based on data that an oral dose of
500 000 IU (administered as 50 000 IU
daily for 10 days) produced a mean
(SD) increase in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol of 32 (15) nmol/L at 17 (7)
weeks after dose[24] and was supported
by fracture-reduction benefits using
300 000 of IU cholecalciferol (administered as 100 000 IU every 4 months)[3]
and 150 000 to 300 000 IU of ergocal

ciferol administered intramuscularly as
a single annual dose.[7] The study was designed so that the vitamin D treatment
would prevent decreases in 25hydroxycholecalciferol over winter,[25]
address low adherence, and be a practical intervention easily translated to
clinical practice.

**METHODS**
**Study Design**
The Vital D study was a single-center,
double-blind, randomized, placebocontrolled trial involving women 70
years or older residing in southern Victoria, Australia (latitude 38°S). The participants were recruited between 2003
and 2005 and were randomly assigned to receive either a single oral
dose of cholecalciferol 500 000 IU or
matched placebo each year for 3 to 5
years (in autumn or winter). Participants were followed up for 12 months
after their last dose of study medication in 2007.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of Barwon
Health and the University of Melbourne and carried out in compliance
with the Helsinki Declaration. All participants provided written informed
consent.
The study recruited 2317 community-dwelling women as previously described.[26] Invitation letters were sent to
all age-eligible women listed on the electoral roll of the region surrounding the
study center. Voting is compulsory in
Australia.
Women were included in the study
if they were at higher risk of hip fracture,[27] defined by criteria such as maternal hip fracture, past fracture, or selfreported faller.[26] Women were excluded
if they could not provide informed
consent or information about falls or
fractures;permanentlyresidedatahighlevel care facility; had an albumincorrected calcium level higher than 2.65
mmol/L; or had a creatinine level higher
than 150 µmol/L, or currently took
vitamin D doses of 400 IU or more, calcitriol, or antifracture therapy. (To convert calcium from mmol/L to mg/dL,
divide by 0.25; creatinine from µmol/L


to mg/dL, divide by 88.4; and serum vitamin D from nmol/L to ng/mL, divide by 2.496.)
Eligible participants were randomized to receive either 500 000 IU of
cholecalciferol or identical placebo.
Allocation was performed by an independent statistician using computergenerated randomization of numbers
performed in blocks of 500. Treatment
allocation status was e-mailed directly
to the hospital clinical trials pharmacist responsible for dispensing study
medication. The participants and
study staff were blinded to intervention group.
Study medication was supplied by
PSM Healthcare, Auckland, New Zealand. Ten tablets were mailed to participants annually (March-August, determined by recruitment date) with
instructions to take all tablets on a single
day. Study staff confirmed by telephone the ingestion of study medication within 2 weeks. Subsequent dosing occurred within 2 weeks of the
anniversary of the first dose.

**Outcome Measures**
Participants’ age, calcium intake, and
fracture-risk profile were collected at
baselinebyquestionnaire. _Falls_ weredefined as “an event reported either by the
faller or a witness, resulting in a person inadvertently coming to rest on the
ground or another lower level, with or
without loss of consciousness or injury.”[28] This definition was explained
to participants and reinforced twice
yearly via newsletter.
All contact with participants was by
mail and telephone. Falls and fractures were recorded using postcard calendars completed daily by writing F if
they had a fall, fracture, or both and N
if they did not and were returned
monthly by prepaid post.[26,29] Participants unable to send postcards were
telephoned monthly.
When a fall or fracture was indicated, a standardized questionnaire recording details was administered by
telephone. Only fractures radiologically confirmed were included in the
analyses. Seventy-three self-reports

were unconfirmed because of 1 of the
following reasons: (1) not x-rayed (eg,
suspected rib fracture), 13 vitamin D
vs 15 placebo; (2) radiologist’s report
stated no fracture, 19 vitamin D vs 23
placebo; and (3) vertebral deformity
with less than 20% height reduction, 2
vitamin D vs 1 placebo. Falls were classified as “resulting from active behavior”’ when the participant, at the time
of the fall, was walking, gardening,
shopping, doing housework, engaging in sports, rushing, or climbing a ladder or chair. Other circumstances surrounding falls were classified as
nonactive behavior. Calcium intake was
quantified annually by questionnaire.[30]
The 150 substudy participants were
randomly selected and results were assayed in a manner blinded to treatment group. Serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (DiaSorin, Stillwater,
Minnesota) and intact parathyroid hormone ([PTH]; Advia Centaur Siemens, Deerfield, Illinois) was measured at baseline and 12 months after
dose. In 2006 and 2007, measurements were also performed 1 and 3
months after dose.

**Sample Size**
Based on 80% power and 5% level of
significance, we calculated that 6855
person-years were needed to detect a
22%relativedifferenceinfracturerates.[7]

Our previous work demonstrates a 3.3%
fracture rate among women older than
70 years[31] and suggests that hip and
forearm fractures could be reduced by
16% and 31%, respectively, if summertime fracture rates were maintained
throughout the year.[32] By using inclusion criteria based on risk factors for hip
fracture, we estimated that our study
participants would have a fracture rate
3-fold higher than communitydwelling women of the same age.

**Statistical Methods**
All analyses were intention-to-treat. Fall
and fracture data were inclusive from
date of first study medication to either
completion or the last complete month
of data (withdrawn or lost to followup). Initial comparisons of outcome

measures between treatment groups
were performed using �[2] tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate.
The primary outcome measures, numbers of falls and fractures, were analyzed using Poisson regression models with robust standard errors to allow
for nonindependence of multiple events
for the same participant. The models included only treatment group but were
also fitted adjusting for baseline calcium intake (�800 mg, 800-1100 mg,
1100-1300 mg, or �1300 mg) and age.
The data were also analyzed using negative binomial regression models that explicitly allow for overdispersion. For
comparison with similar studies, time
to first fracture and fall was analyzed
using Cox proportional hazards models. Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative
incidence are presented.
Post hoc analyses were undertaken
to investigate the relationship between the treatment effect and time
since ingesting the annual dose. Each
year of follow-up was split into 2 follow-up segments: at 3 months and 9
months after dosing. A generalized estimating equation approach was used
to allow for correlation between a par

ticipant’s falls and fractures at the different time periods. Estimated incidence rate ratios (RRs) for 0 through
3 months and 4 through 12 months after dosing are presented with the P value
testing for homogeneity of the 2 incidence RRs.
No adjustment was made for multiple testing. All P values are 2-sided to
detect differences, P � .05. Analyses
were performed in Stata 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Although adverse events were monitored, there was not a data and safety
monitoring board or stopping rules because at the time the study commenced, these were not usual practice
for vitamin D randomized controlled
trials. US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency
guidelines did not indicate a need, and
based on published data, we had no expectation of harm.

other participants. At the end of the
study, approximately 6% in the placebo group (as of 2008, 65 of 1125)
and 3% (38 of 1131) in the vitamin D
group were taking more than 400
IU/d of vitamin D supplements.

**Fall Outcomes**
The 2256 participants had a total of
5404 falls over 6925 person-years. Seventy-four percent of 1131 women in the
vitamin D group and 68% of 1125
women in the placebo group had at least
1 fall (TABLE 2). The vitamin D group
had 2892 falls at a rate of 83.4 per 100
person-years vs 2512 in the placebo
group at a rate of 72.7 per 100 personyears (incidence RR, 1.15; (95% CI,
1.02-1.30; P =.03; TABLE 3). The results did not change after adjusting for
age nor when analyzed using negative
binomialregressiontoallowforoverdispersion. The cumulative incidence of
first fall was increased in the vitamin
D group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95%
CI, 1.05-1.28; P =.003; FIGURE 2).
Increased falls in the vitamin D
group were observed for each classification of falls: falls with fracture,
falls without fracture, and falls with
soft tissue injury (Table 2). The proportion of falls that resulted in a physician visit did not differ: 27.2% (778
of 2892) in the vitamin D group vs
26.1% (657 of 2512) in the placebo
group.

**Fracture Outcomes**
One hundred fifty-five women receiving vitamin D sustained 171 fractures
and 125 receiving placebo sustained
135 fractures (Table 2). The fracture
rate in the vitamin D group was 4.9 per
100 person-years vs 3.9 in the placebo
group. The incidence RR for fracture
was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.59; P=.047)
compared with the placebo group. Similarly, the nonvertebral fracture RR was
1.28 in the vitamin D group (incidence RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.65;
_P_ =.06). The HR cumulative incidence
of first fracture was 1.26 in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group (95% CI, 0.99-1.59; P=.06;
Figure 2).


ticipants were followed up until the predetermined study end in 2008. The proportion who commenced antifracture
therapy during the intervention period did not differ (90 of 1131 in the
vitamin D vs 87 of 1125 in the placebo
group; P =.84).
The groups did not differ significantly by age, risk profile, calcium intake,orbiochemistry(TABLE **1).Thepro-**

HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN D AND FALLS AND FRACTURES IN WOMEN


(ie, just prior to the second through
fifth annual dose administrations and
at study completion). There was a
marked increase in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels in the vitamin D
group with some evidence of this
increase trailing off toward the end of
the trial. The median 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels 12 months after
dose in the vitamin D group ranged
from 55 nmol/L to 74 nmol/L over the
5 intervals with individual values
ranging from 25 nmol/L to 120
nmol/L (FIGURE 3). The medians and
IQRs of the PTH levels remained
stable 12 months after dosing.
In 2006 and 2007, samples were collected at 1 and 3 months after dose in
102 (74%) of the substudy participants. The median 25-hydroxycholecalciferol level in the vitamin D group
1 month after dose was slightly
more than 120 nmol/L with 82% at
100 nmol/L or higher and 24% at


The frequency of falls among women
who sustained a fracture did not differ
between groups with a median of 2
falls (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4)
throughout the study course.

**Temporal Effect of Annual Dose**
The incidence RR of falls in the vitamin
D group was 1.31 in the first 3 months
(95% CI, 1.12-1.54) following dosing,
but only 1.13 (95% CI, 0.99-1.29) during the remaining 9 months of the year
(P valueforhomogeneity=.02; **TABLE** **4).**
The temporal pattern of excess falls was
observed each year except the first year.
Although not statistically significant, the temporal pattern observed in
falls was also observed in fractures
(Table 3). The vitamin D fracture incidence RR compared with the placebo group was 1.53 (95% CI, 0.952.46) in the first 3 months after dosing
and 1.18 (95% CI, 0.91-1.54) during the
following 9 months.

**Calcium Intake**
**and Questionnaire Data**
The proportion of participants with calcium intake of less than 800 mg/d decreased from 33% at baseline to 27%
over the subsequent annual assessments, whereas the proportion consuming 1100 mg or more increased
from 40% to 46%. There was no difference between the groups in the categories of calcium intake (Table 1). The
median daily calcium intake was 976
mg (IQR, 691-1311 mg).

**Biochemistry Substudy**
Ninety-one percent (137 of 150) of
those invited to participate in the biochemistry substudy consented. Baseline samples were collected from 133
participants, 75 from the vitamin D


group and 58 from the placebo group.
One sample from each group was excluded because 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels of 123 nmol/L and 115
nmol/L suggested that the women were
taking more than 400 IU vitamin D
supplementation per day.
At baseline, the median 25-hydroxycholecalciferol level was 49 nmol/L
(IQR, 40-63; normal lower limit, �50
nmol/L). Less than 3% of the substudy participants had 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels lower than 25 nmol/L.
The 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and
PTH levels did not differ between the
groups (Table 1). Approximately half
of the substudy participants had 25hydroxycholecalciferol levels of 50
nmol/L or lower (vitamin D, 45.9% vs
61.4%, placebo) but less than 5% had
levels of 25 nmol/L or lower (vitamin
D, 4.0% vs 3.5%, placebo).
In each year of the study, samples
were obtained 12 months after dose

HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN D AND FALLS AND FRACTURES IN WOMEN


were considered related to study medication.

**COMMENT**
Contrary to our hypothesis, participants receiving annual high-dose oral
cholecalciferol experienced 15% more
falls and 26% more fractures than the
placebo group. Women not only experienced excess fractures after more frequent falls but also experienced more
fractures that were not associated with
a fall. A post hoc analysis found that the
increased likelihood of falls in the vitamin D group was exacerbated in the
3-month period immediately following the annual dose and a similar temporal trend was observed for fractures. An increased risk (albeit, not
significant because of smaller numbers) of falls and fracture in the vitamin D group was apparent for each year
of the intervention. The results were
similar after adjustment for baseline calcium intake; age was not included in
the models because its inclusion did not
affect the model estimates.
Data from the substudy indicate that
theparticipantshadintermediate25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels at baseline,
typical of community-dwelling older
womenoftheregion[25] andtypicalofolder
women in Northern Europe and North
America.[33] The intervention effectively
increased background 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels. Predictably, the levelsincreasedsubstantially1monthafter
dosing and thereafter declined toward
baseline but remaining on average 41%
higher than levels in the placebo group
at 12 months. The pattern is consistent
with serial measurements done in older
New Zealanders supplemented with
500 000 IU cholecalciferol.[34]
Only1otherstudyhasreportedanincrease in fracture associated with vitamin D treatment.[8] Participants (4354
men, 5086 women) 75 years or older received an annual injection of 300000 IU
vitamin D2 as ergocalciferol or placebo.
In men, treatment had no effect on fractures. However women treated with vitamin D had increased risk of nonvertebral (HR, 1.21), hip/femur (HR, 1.80),
and hip/femur/wrist/forearm fractures

Serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels in the vitamin D group differ from those of the placebo group
at all 12-month assessments after dose (P�.05). The
medians are shown as the horizontal bar within the
rectangle and the interquartile range as the ends of
the rectangle. The 5th and 95th percentiles are shown
as lines (whiskers), and the closed circles represent outliers. The proportion of biochemistry substudy participants categorized into 25-hydroxycholecalciferol status is (vitamin D group, n=74 vs placebo group, n=57,
respectively) 25 nmol/L or less: 4% vs 3.5%; 26 to
50 nmol/L: 41.9% vs 57.9%; 51 to 74 nmol/L: 44.5%
vs 33.3%; 75 nmol/L or higher: 9.5% vs 5.3%. To
convert 25-hydroxycholecalciferol from nmol/L to ng/
mL, divide by 2.496.


150 nmol/L or higher (FIGURE 4). By
3 months, the after-dose median 25hydroxycholecalciferol levels decreased to approximately 90 nmol/L in
the vitamin D group.

**Adverse Events**
A similar number of participants in each
group reported at least 1 adverse event:
19.7% in the vitamin D and 17.8% in
the placebo group. The most common
adverse events were injury including
fracture—15.2% (172 of 1131) of
women taking vitamin D vs 12.1% (136
of 1125) taking placebo (P = _.03)—_
and cardiovascular events—1.5% (171
of 1131) vs 1.2% (13 of 1125), respectively. Seven women (0.6%) in the vitamin D group vs 10 (0.9%) in the placebo group were diagnosed with cancer.
Serious adverse events (International Conference on Harmonization/
WHO Good Clinical Practice definition including hospitalization or death)
did not differ significantly: 244 among
women taking vitamin D vs 207 women
taking placebo (P =.06). Eighty-seven
participants died during the study, 40
taking vitamin D vs 47 taking placebo. None of the serious adverse events

HIGH-DOSE VITAMIN D AND FALLS AND FRACTURES IN WOMEN


erol of 375 to 500 nmol/L[40] because the
highest level at 1 month in the biochemistry substudy was 208 nmol/L.
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans
given a single, large oral dose of cholecalciferol indicate that 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels peak at 7 to 21
days and thereafter decrease slowly
(half-life, 60-90 days), so it is likely the
peak levels were only marginally higher
than the 1-month levels.[24,41] Furthermore, the incremental increase in 25hydroxycholecalciferol is likely to be
lower in those already replete prior to
supplementation.[34]
This is the first study to demonstrate increased risk of falls associated
with any vitamin D intervention and the
second study to demonstrate an increased fracture risk associated with annual high-dose vitamin D therapy in elderly women. Our study used the
largest total annual dose of vitamin D
(500 000 IU) reported in any large randomized controlled trial, raising the
possibility that the adverse outcome is
dose-related. The opposing outcomes
of 2 studies[3,8] that used the same total
annual dose (300 000 IU intramuscularly) suggest that the dosing regimen
(ie, 4 monthly vs annually) rather than
the total dose might determine the outcome. This line of reasoning is supported by the temporal risk pattern that
we observed and the fact that harm has
not been reported in the numerous
studies that have used more frequent
dosing. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that high serum levels of vitamin
D or metabolites resulting from the
large annual dose, subsequent decrease in the levels, or both might be
causal. Furthermore, because the levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol demonstrated in this study could occur with
other recommended dosing regimens,[42,43] the outcome of this study suggests that safety of high-dose vitamin
D supplementation warrants further
study.

(HR, 1.59). No effect on falls was observed; however, falls were a secondary outcome and ascertainment was
based on 6-month recall. Baseline and
changes in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol
and PTH levels were very similar to our
results. Another common feature was
that calcium supplements were not
given. Whether calcium supplementation is beneficial in vitamin D intervention studies is uncertain. Studies that
have shown reductions in fracture with
vitamin D therapy have variously
used[4,9,10] or not used[3,7] a calcium supplement. The RECORD (Randomised
Evaluation of Calcium or Vitamin D)[2]
study showed no benefit of adding calcium to vitamin D, using a factorial randomized study design.
The study of Chapuy et al[4] treated female nursing home residents (mean 25hydroxycholecalciferol level, 36
nmol/L) with 800 IU of oral cholecalciferol plus 1.2 g of calcium or placebo taken daily. Hip and nonvertebral fractures were significantly reduced
by about 25%. Likewise, in communitydwelling men and women randomized to receive 100 000 IU of oral cholecalciferol in 4 monthly doses, Trivedi
et al[3] showed reductions in any fracture and fracture at the hip, wrist, forearm, or spine. Other studies report
either reductions[7,9,10] or no effect[1,2,6,11,35]
in fracture rates in the active groups.
The Women’s Health Initiative study[1]
showed no effect of daily calcium plus
400 IU of cholecalciferol on fractures.
The RECORD study[2] showed no effect
in secondary prevention of fractures or
falls in elderly participants treated daily
with 800 IU of cholecalciferol alone,
cholecalciferol plus calcium, or calcium alone, although only 54% were
still taking study medication at 24
months. Other studies using intermittent oral vitamin D in older people living in residential care did not show any
reduction in fractures.[11,13]
Meta-analyses suggest that there is a
threshold level for vitamin D supplementation of more than 400 IU daily
for fracture risk reduction and that reductions in hip and nonvertebral fractures are independent of calcium


supplementation.[14-18] Doses of 700 to
800 IU daily reduced the risk of nonvertebral and hip fractures with stronger evidence of benefit in reducing hip
fracture risk when the analysis was restricted to institutionalized adults.[18] By
contrast, a Cochrane review[20] concluded that vitamin D therapy alone appeared unlikely to be effective in preventing fracture.
Evidence of risk reduction of falls
with vitamin D supplementation with
and without calcium is also inconsistent. Overall there appears to be an 11%
to 19% reduction in fall risk with
supplementation and a possible dose
threshold of 700 to 1000 IU daily.[18,23]
No fall risk reduction was observed for
doses of less than 700 IU or achieved
serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels of less than 60 nmol/L, consistent
with an earlier review of trials using
varying doses of vitamin D that concluded that there was insufficient evidence that cholecalciferol treatment reduced falls.[36] Currently 600 IU (15 µg)
per day is recommended for adults 70
years or older in the United States and
Canada [37,38] with an upper limit of 2000
IU per day (~700000 IU per year). Cholecalciferol 1000 IU is listed on the Australian Register of therapeutic goods. Although our results cannot necessarily
be applied to high-dose vitamin D administered in divided doses over the
year, they suggest that further study to
assess safety is needed.
The major strength of our study is
that it was a large randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial. Falls
and fracture ascertainment were robust,[29,39] although nonclinical vertebral fractures would have been missed.
The pragmatic design of the study provided high potential for translation into
public health policy and clinical practice. The main weaknesses of the study
are also related to its pragmatic design—the participants were not evaluated at the study center so that baseline clinical information may have been
missed. Biochemical assessment of all
participantswasnotpossible.Wedonot
