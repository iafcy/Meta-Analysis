**Background: Increased dietary calcium intake has been**
proposed as a population-based public health intervention to prevent osteoporotic fractures. We have examined whether calcium supplementation decreases clinical fracture risk in elderly women and its mechanism of
action.

**Methods: Five-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled**
study of 1460 women recruited from the population and
older than 70 years (mean age, 75 years) who were randomized to receive calcium carbonate, 600 mg twice per
day, or identical placebo. The primary end points included clinical incident osteoporotic fractures, vertebral deformity, and adverse events ascertained in 5 years.
Bone structure was also measured using dual x-ray absorptiometry of the hip and whole body, quantitative ultrasonography of the heel, and peripheral quantitative
computed tomography of the distal radius.

80% or more of their tablets (calcium or placebo) per year
had reduced fracture incidence in the calcium compared
with the placebo groups (10.2% vs 15.4%; hazard ratio,
0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97). Calciumtreated patients had improved quantitative ultrasonographyfindingsoftheheel,femoralneckandwhole-bodydual
x-ray absorptiometry data, and bone strength compared
with placebo-treated patients. Of the 92000 adverse events
recorded, constipation was the only event increased by the
treatment (calcium group, 13.4%; placebo group, 9.1%).

den and pharmaceutical consumption were similar to data obtained from whole populations of this age.[9] Informed consent
was obtained, and the Human Rights Committee of the University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia, approved the study.

**BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS**

A prevalent fracture was recorded if it occurred after the age of
50 years, was due to minimal trauma as defined by falling from
a height of less than 1 m, and was not of the face, skull, or phalanges (Table 1). The number of years since menopause was
calculated for each patient using reported age at last menstrual period, hysterectomy and ovariectomy, or onset of hot
flushes. A positive smoking history was reported if at least 1
cigarette per day had been smoked for 3 months or longer at
any time. Daily intake of protein, calcium, and alcohol was determined from a self-administered semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire.[10,11]

**CLINICAL MEASUREMENTS**

Grip strength of the dominant hand was recorded as the highest
of 3 attempts[12] using a handheld dynamometer (Hand Grip Dynamometer; TEC, Clifton, NJ). Body mass index was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
Activity levels were calculated in kilocalories per day using
a validated method[13] that combines body weight, answers to
questions on the number of hours and type of physical activity, and energy costs of such activities,[14,15] with a response of
no to the activity questions resulting in a 0 score.
Mobility functioning was measured by the timed Up & Go
test, which required that patients be timed while getting up,
walking 3 m, turning, returning to the chair, and sitting down
again.[16] Results of the standing Rhomberg Balance Test[17] were
classified as to whether the patient was able to maintain a tandem stance for at least 10 seconds.

**BONE MEASUREMENTS**

Calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) measurements
of the left foot were obtained using an ultrasound densitometer (Lunar Achilles; GE Lunar Corp, Madison, Wis) at baseline and 5 years; the coefficients of variation (CV) for speed of
sound and broadband ultrasound attenuation were 0.43% and
1.59%, respectively. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone den

densitometer (Hologic Acclaim 4500A; Hologic Corp, Waltham,
Mass) at 1 and 5 years. The CVs at the total hip, femoral neck,
and whole body were 1.2%, 1.4%, and 0.8%, respectively.[18] Peripheral quantitative computed tomography bone structure and
density were measured in the radius at a site 4% of the length
of the radius distal to the wrist joint, using a peripheral quantitative computed tomography device (XCT-2000; StraTec
Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). The voxel size
was set at 150 µm in the x and y directions and 1000 µm in the
z direction. The CVs for trabecular and cortical bone mineral
density were 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The cross-sectional
area of cortical bone was measured using a threshold of periosteal and endosteal bone density of 710 and 169 mg/cm[3], respectively. The Stress Strain Index was calculated as the product of the section modulus and cortical density normalized to
the maximal physiological cortical density of human bones (1200
mg/cm[3]) for the polar moment and the bending moments in
the x and y directions, where the y direction is the widest part
of the radius and the x direction is perpendicular to this.[19]

**BIOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS**

Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was measured
using an immunochemiluminometric method with intraassay and interassay CVs of 3.6% and 6.2%, respectively.[20] Total
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was measured using an extraction technique, followed by a competitive binding assay using diluted human serum that measures 25-hydroxycholecalciferolandergocalciferollevelsequally.Intra-assayandinterassay
CVs were 8% and 16%, respectively.[21]

**RANDOMIZATION TO STUDY TREATMENT**
**AND COMPLIANCE**

Patients received calcium carbonate tablets, 600 mg twice per
day (with morning and evening meals), or identical placebo tablets (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, Baulkham Hills, Australia).
The randomization list was produced by generating 150 blocks
of 10 numbers. In each block, 5 positions representing placebo
and 5 positions representing calcium treatment were ordered using a letter code according to a random number generator. The
numbered blocks were ordered according to randomly generated numbers, and an identification number was assigned in order to each letter code in the randomized list. The Pharmacy DepartmentoftheSirCharlesGairdnerHospital,Nedlands,Australia,
assigned a treatment to the letter code and assigned the appropriate medications to the patient according to this list. The randomization was stratified by allocating patients to blocks according to whether a prevalent nontraumatic fracture had
occurred after age 50 years, ensuring that an equal number of
patients with and without a prevalent fracture received placebo
or calcium. Medication compliance was checked by counting returned tablets at each 12-month review and was calculated as a
percentage of the optimum. Average yearly compliance of less
than 80% was classified as noncompliant.

**INCIDENT FRACTURES AND ADVERSE EVENTS**

Adverse events resulting in attendance to a health care professional were recorded in a diary at 4-month intervals and coded
using the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2-Plus, system database of disease coding (Family Medicine Research Unit, Department of General Practice, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia). Adverse events were grouped
according to 17 categories identified by the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2-Plus, system.[22] Atrau

matic incident clinical fractures and atraumatic symptomatic
vertebral fractures were reported in the diary. The diagnosis
and classification of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were
confirmed by radiographic reports.
Vertebral deformities were assessed using morphometric
x-ray absorptiometry software on a densitometer (software version 9.1, Hologic 4500A; Hologic Corp) at years 1 and 5. The
positions of 6 reference markers for each vertebra were placed
at the corners and in the middle of the upper and lower surface
of each vertebra. The mean CVs in morphometric x-ray absorptiometry measurements of the anterior, middle, and posterior
heights of vertebrae varied from 5.8% at T6 to 3.1% at L4. Vertebral heights reference data and values for deformities were calculated according to a modification of the procedure described
by McCloskey et al.[23] Incident vertebral deformities were defined as vertebral deformities not present at year 1, with a reduction in posterior, middle, or anterior heights of 20% or more.

**STATISTICS AND POWER CALCULATIONS**

Statistical procedures were performed with SPSSPC for Windows version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). The time to first


clinical event was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model with and without adjustment for covariates. Differences between normally distributed characteristics of the treatment groups were determined by univariate analysis of variance
with adjustments for covariates. The Mann-Whitney test was
used to determine the differences between the groups for nonnormally distributed variables. All statistical tests were 2-tailed,
and P�.05 was considered significant.
Power calculations were conducted before study commencement, assuming a fracture rate of 3.5% per year in the placebo
group and assuming that calcium would reduce the event rate
by 35%. At a power of at least 80%, at an � of .05, and allowing
for a 30% noncompliance rate during the 5-year study, recruitment of 737 patients per group was required.


Patient recruitment for the study and their final categorization is shown in Figure 1. Of the 1222 women excluded, 977 (80.0%) were taking medications that could
affect bone mass, 199 (16.3%) had medical conditions that

44 (3.6%) were participating in another clinical trial, and
2 (0.2%) were not prepared to be assigned to the placebo.
Another 1580 individuals were not interested. Therefore,
1510 women were eligible for the study, of whom the first
1460 were recruited. There were no differences in baseline demographic characteristics between the placebo and
calcium groups. In a randomly selected subset of patients
(n=81), 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were generally above
the deficient range because only 6.1% (during winter) and
2.8% (during summer) of patients had vitamin D concentrations below 12 ng/mL (�30 nmol/L) (mean±SD winter level, 27±14 ng/mL [67±35 nmol/L]; mean±SD summer level, 35±12 ng/mL [87±30 nmol/L]). No PTH
concentrations were above the upper limit of the reference range (mean±SD winter level, 37±11 pg/mL;
mean±SD summer level, 37±11 pg/mL; n=81).

Eight hundred thirty patients (56.8%) complied with the
medication regimen throughout the study, with no significant difference in compliance failure in the calcium
group (310 patients) compared with the placebo group
(320 patients) (�[2]=0.28; P =.60). Compared with compliant patients, noncompliant persons were slightly older,
weaker, and slower and had lower QUS measures
(Table 1), but there were no differences related to the
original randomization to calcium or placebo.

A preplanned per protocol analysis restricted to the
830 patients (56.8%) who consumed 80% of tablets
(Figure 2 and Table 2) demonstrated a reduction in allsite clinical fractures (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97), appendicular fractures (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.97), and
upper limb fractures (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92) in
the calcium group before and after adjustment for age,
body mass index, and prevalent baseline fracture entered as covariates. Baseline dietary calcium intake did
not influence any of the HRs obtained. Although analysis of the baseline structural assessment of the skeleton
using heel QUS (broadband ultrasound attenuation or
speed of sound) adjusted for treatment status showed that
individuals with higher measurements had reduced incident fracture risk (HR per 1-SD increase in speed of
sound, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.77; HR per 1-SD increase
in broadband ultrasound attenuation, 0.70; 95% CI 0.610.80), the addition of baseline QUS bone structural measures did not substantially alter any of the fracture HRs
examined.
An analysis of fractures in the noncompliant population showed no difference in the number or type of fractures sustained between placebo- and calcium-treated
patients.

**BONE STRUCTURE AND BIOCHEMISTRY**

There was no difference in any bone factors between calcium- and placebo-treated patients at baseline (QUS) and
1 year (DXA) (Table 1). The changes in bone structure
are shown in Figure 3. The QUS measurements from
baseline to 5 years, adjusted for body mass index, age,
and tablet compliance, show significant improvement in
calcium-treated patients for broadband ultrasound attenuation and stiffness, but not speed of sound. A reduction in the loss of bone content and area but not bone
mineral density was seen at the femoral neck and whole

cross-sectional radius peripheral quantitative computed tomography data measured at 5 years show a larger
cortical volume in the calcium group compared with the
placebo group, which had a favorable effect on the bone
strength factors of the polar Stress Strain Index and Stress
Strain Index in the x and y directions.
The PTH level decreased from baseline to year 5 (107
placebo- and 103 calcium-treated patients) in the calcium
compared with the placebo group (mean ± SD change,
−8.9±13.2 and −2.0±13.2 pg/mL, respectively; P�.001).

**COMMENT**


The patients recruited for the study were representative of
non–vitaminD–deficientambulatorywomenolderthan70
years who have a 5-year risk of fracture greater than 15%.
The principal finding was that randomization to a calcium supplement for 5 years failed to show a significant
preventive effect on fracture, with results similar to those
of a previous meta-analysis[24] of a number of small studies
of appendicular fracture (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.671.12) and a recently reported study[25] of patients with a previous fracture (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.09). They are divergent from previous reports[26,27] of beneficial effects of
combined calcium and cholecalciferol (vitamin D) treatment in patients who may have been vitamin D deficient
and studies[28,29] showing a reduction in spine fracture with
calcium supplementation in osteoporotic patients.
The lack of significance of calcium therapy in the intention-to-treat analysis is likely due to the lack of compliance with the medication regimen, which in the power
calculation before commencement of the study was predicted to be 30%, but was in fact 43%. This is a limitation
of the study but reflects the difficulties of implementation of preventive health practice in all such studies. Another possible cause for this relative lack of efficacy may
be that the vitamin D status of the population, although
substantially better than that encountered in studies in
higher latitudes, may have been insufficient to allow optimal absorption and disposal of calcium to the skeleton.
Intheper-protocolanalysisofthe56.8%ofpatientswho
took 80% or more of their assigned medication, the risk
of any clinical osteoporotic fracture was reduced by a factor of 0.34 (absolute risk reduction, 15.4%-10.2%). The

maintenance of or improvement in QUS and DXA measures with calcium supplementation supports an effect to
improve bone mass and possibly architecture. The peripheral quantitative computed tomography data showed that
the effect of calcium was principally to maintain cortical
bone in the endocortical area. At the radial site, it was possible to demonstrate an increase in cortical volume and
therefore mass and calculated resistance to torsional and
bending forces by calcium, an expected result of increased cortical bone mass. The lack of effect on trabecular bone density was surprising but may relate to a substantiallydamagedtrabecularstructureintheseindividuals
or a site-specific effect of reduced bone resorption via effects on reducing the PTH level.[5] This was supported by

studies of the effectiveness of pharmacologic agents other
than hormone replacement therapy[30] in reducing fracture rates has been restricted to high-risk populations with
low DXA bone mineral density.[31] When patients have not
been selected on the basis of low DXA bone mass density,
no hip fracture reduction has been found.[32]

group, thus making it unlikely that patients had become
noncompliant owing to treatment status.
Because it is important for a public health intervention to be safe, we conducted a careful evaluation of adverse events. Our evaluation showed that, although constipation increased with calcium treatment, the risk of
kidney stones, ischemic heart disease, or other adverse
events was not increased.
In conclusion, the calcium supplementation regimen
tested currently cannot be recommended as a public health
approach to fracture prevention because of the lack of
long-term compliance. These data should give pause to
those who consider that public health policy in this area
should be based on epidemiological or surrogate endpoint data. However, these data support the continued
use of calcium supplements by women who are able to
remain compliant with their use. In these individuals, especially if they are under the care of a clinician, calcium
supplementation is a safe and effective therapy for reducing the risk of osteoporotic fracture.
