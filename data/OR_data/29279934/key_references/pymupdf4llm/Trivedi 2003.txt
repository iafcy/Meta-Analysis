#### Daksha P Trivedi, Richard Doll, Kay Tee Khaw


### Abstract

**Objective To determine the effect of four monthly**
vitamin D supplementation on the rate of fractures in
men and women aged 65 years and over living in the
community.
**Design Randomised double blind controlled trial of**
100 000 IU oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
supplementation or matching placebo every four
months over five years.
**Setting and participants 2686 people (2037 men and**
649 women) aged 65-85 years living in the general
community, recruited from the British doctors register
and a general practice register in Suffolk.
**Main outcome measures Fracture incidence and total**
mortality by cause.
**Results After five years 268 men and women had**
incident fractures, of whom 147 had fractures in
common osteoporotic sites (hip, wrist or forearm, or
vertebrae). Relative risks in the vitamin D group
compared with the placebo group were 0.78 (95%
confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99, P=0.04) for any first
fracture and 0.67 (0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) for first hip,
wrist or forearm, or vertebral fracture. 471
participants died. The relative risk for total mortality
in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo
group was 0.88 (0.74 to 1.06, P=0.18). Findings were
consistent in men and women and in doctors and the
general practice population.
**Conclusion Four monthly supplementation with**
100 000 IU oral vitamin D may prevent fractures
without adverse effects in men and women living in
the general community.

### Introduction

Osteoporotic fractures are projected to increase exponentially worldwide.1 Most fracture prevention trials
have focused on clinically defined groups such as
people with osteoporosis or previous fractures and
have mainly been conducted in women.2–7 Safe,
effective, feasible, and cost effective primary prevention
measures are needed in older men and women, in
whom most osteoporotic fractures occur. We report
results from a randomised double blind trial of four


monthly supplementation with oral vitamin D3 on fractures and mortality in 2686 men and women aged
65-85 years living in the community.

### Methods

**Study population**
This trial was a pilot to assess the feasibility of a
community trial (not subsequently conducted owing to
lack of funding) in 20 000 men and women. We
recruited men and women aged 65-85 from the British
doctors study register at the Clinical Trials Studies
Unit, Oxford,8 and the age-sex register of a general
practice in Ipswich, Suffolk. Cambridge local ethics
committee approved the study.

**Recruitment and randomisation**
We recruited participants by using a mailed letter and
information sheet. We excluded people who were
already taking vitamin D supplements and people with
conditions that were contraindications to vitamin D
supplementation—for example, a history of renal
stones, sarcoidosis, or malignancy.
We sent invitations to 11 120 people (9582 from
the British doctors study and 1538 from general practice), and 3504 (31.5%) of them (2907 from British
doctors study and 597 from general practice) initially
agreed to participate. From June 1996 to March 1997
we randomised 2686 (77.5%) people who were eligible
and gave informed consent, after stratification by age
and sex, to receive either treatment with vitamin D or a
placebo. Participants and investigators were blinded to
the treatment until the study ended, when Ipswich
Pharmacy revealed the coding.

**Study design**
We conducted the study by post. Participants
completed an initial questionnaire. We assessed prevalence of disease with the question “Do you have the
following conditions?” followed by a checklist. We used
a modified food frequency questionnaire at four years
to estimate dietary calcium intake.

**Intervention**
We sent one capsule containing 100 000 IU vitamin D3
(cholecalciferol) or matching placebo by post every

four months for five years (15 doses in total). We asked
participants to take the capsule immediately on
receipt, complete a form indicating that they had done
so, and return the form by Freepost.
The dose had previously been shown to be safe, to
raise blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations to
physiological levels achievable by lifestyle means, and
to have a measurable impact on concentrations of
parathyroid hormone over several weeks.9 The
expected differences in blood concentrations of
25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone are
associated with differences in bone density and fracture
risk.10 11

Participants continued any usual drug treatment
and any new drugs that were advised during routine
care. If they were advised to start vitamin D
supplements of more than 200 IU daily they discontinued the trial intervention but continued to be followed
for endpoints.

**Endpoint ascertainment**
On receiving the capsule, participants filled in a checklist of events (fracture or major illness) and returned
the form by Freepost. All participants were flagged at
the Office for National Statistics for mortality and
followed until 31 March 2002. A nosologist blind to the
intervention coded death certificates by using ICD-9
(international classification of diseases, 9th revision).
We ascertained incidences of fracture, cardiovascular
disease, and cancer by using events identified from
questionnaires or death certification by cause.

**Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone,**
**and heel sonometry**
After four years we invited 235 participants from general practice who had taken at least 10 capsules to a
clinic for measurement of serum vitamin D and
parathyroid hormone concentrations. The visit took
place in September and October, about three weeks
after a dose. We assessed heel bone sonometry with
CUBA equipment (McCue Ultrasonics, Winchester).


**Statistical analyses**
We included all participants randomised to active vitamin D or placebo in the analyses, according to
intention to treat. We compared relative risks for
incidence of fracture, mortality by cause, and incidence
of cardiovascular disease and cancer for active vitamin
D versus placebo by using crude rates and then, after
adjustment for age, with the Cox regression method,12

by using SPSS software, version 10.0.


### Results

vertebrae. The differences were consistent when stratified by sex or by doctor versus general practice population. We observed differences one year into the study
(fig 1).

**Other health events**
Table 3 shows cumulative mortality to March 2002.
The vitamin D group had slightly but not significantly
lower mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease,
and cancer than the placebo group. Figure 2 shows the
cumulative probability of survival in the vitamin D
group compared with the placebo group over five
years. Table 4 shows the incidence of major health
events. These did not differ significantly between the
treatment groups.

**Physiological variables and compliance**
Table 5 shows mean serum concentrations of vitamin
D and parathyroid hormone and heel bone ultrasound
attenuation in the subgroup. Mean vitamin D concentrations were 40% higher in the active treatment group
than in the placebo group. Mean parathyroid
concentrations were 6% lower, but this difference was
not significant. Heel ultrasound measures did not differ
by treatment.
Compliance did not differ between doctors and the
general practice population or between the treatment
groups; 76% (2050/2686) of participants had at least
80% compliance (12/15 doses). Compliance for the
final dose was 66% (1784/2686); excluding participants who had died, we estimated compliance to be
80% (1784/2215). A total of 631 (23.5%) participants,
including those who died, did not complete the full five
years to March 2002—22.8% (307) in the vitamin D
group and 24.2% (324) in the placebo group (P=0.41).
No significant difference existed between the two
groups in the number known to be alive but who withdrew (that is, discontinued questionnaire follow up)
from the study: 5.7% (77) in the placebo group and
6.2% (83) in the active group (P=0.64).

have led to ascertainment errors, but random errors
would underestimate associations. In this randomised
double blinded design, biased ascertainment between

hood of accurate ascertainment of events. Fracture
rates did not differ significantly between doctors and
the general practice population, indicating that people
in the general community report fracture accurately,
an assumption supported by several studies.13 14


**Comparisons with previous studies**
Several studies report that daily supplementation with
vitamin D and calcium reduces fractures.2 3 Chapuy
reported that daily supplementation with vitamin D
800 IU and calcium reduced hip fractures by 30% over
three years in 3270 elderly women.2 Whether calcium
alone, vitamin D alone, or the combination was
responsible for these effects is not clear. In our study
the effect size of isolated vitamin D supplementation—
about 20% reduction in total fractures and 30% reduction in fractures at major osteoporotic sites—is
comparable to that reported by Chapuy for combined
daily vitamin D and calcium.2

Previous studies of isolated vitamin D supplementation have been inconclusive.15–17 The lack of
significant reduction in fractures in these studies could
be explained by a lack of power due to a lower dose of
supplement, shorter duration, or lower number of
events as well as ineffectiveness of vitamin D. Lips
found no protective effect of vitamin D 400 IU daily in
1578 participants.16 This dose may have been too low
to achieve a clinical effect. In our study the four
monthly 100 000 IU dose averages a daily equivalent
similar to the 800 IU vitamin D used in the trials by
Chapuy and Dawson Hughes.2 3 Heikinheimo, using
annual injections of 150 000-300 000 IU in 899
participants, reported a reduction in fractures of the
upper limb but not the lower limb.17 This study was not
properly randomised or blinded, and a single annual
dose may not provide adequate concentrations in the
blood over a whole year.
Vitamin D may protect against fractures through
concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Low concentrations of vitamin D are associated with increased
concentrations of parathyroid hormone, increased
bone resorption, and lower bone mass.9–11 The 40%
higher mean concentrations of vitamin D seen in the
active treatment group in our trial were still not high
in absolute terms. Parathyroid hormone concentrations were only slightly and not significantly lower.
This suggests that 100 000 IU vitamin D four monthly
may not have lowered parathyroid hormone concentrations adequately, and a more frequent dose might
be considered in future trials.
We found no significant effects of vitamin D on
total mortality or incidence of cancer or cardiovascular disease, as suggested by observational studies.18 19

However, the fact that the relative risks were in a
favourable direction in the active treatment group is
reassuring.

**Generalisability**
To maximise generalisability, this was a pragmatic trial
with minimal exclusion criteria. The doctors were similar to the general practice population in terms of compliance, fracture rates, and effects of vitamin D. Blood
concentrations of vitamin D in participants taking placebo were comparable to those of population groups
of similar ages in northern latitudes in the United
States3 and higher than those in older European populations living in northern latitudes.16 20 If vitamin D
supplementation is safe and effective for fracture
prevention, even in relatively replete healthy participants, it is unlikely to be of lesser benefit in people with
lower vitamin D levels.

**Public health implications**
This trial was a pilot for a larger trial that was not
funded and was, consequently, too small for any
decisive effect on fractures to be expected. The results,
nevertheless, indicate that isolated vitamin D supplementation prevents fractures. This is particularly
important for primary prevention. Several
interventions—such as bisphosphonates, oestrogen,
and calcium and vitamin D—reduce fractures in high
risk groups.2–7 Their application to primary prevention
is, however, problematic as the balance of risk-benefit
and cost-benefit differs in primary and secondary prevention.
The alendronate trial identified 2000 women at
high risk of fracture (low bone mineral density and
previous fracture).4 The 25% reduction in fractures
seen translates to an absolute benefit of 60 women
treated for one year to prevent any fracture; the
absolute benefit was lower in a later trial on women
without a previous fracture.5 Whereas relative reductions in fracture may be generalisable, the absolute
benefit differs in groups in which absolute fracture
risks are lower. The 22% reduction in fractures in our
study translates to approximately 250 people treated
for one year to prevent any fracture.
Risk of fracture is related to bone health across the
whole population distribution, such that most fractures
do not occur in the small numbers of people with
severe osteoporosis at very high risk but in the large
numbers at moderately increased risk. To have a
substantial effect on total fractures in the population,
intervention would be needed in large numbers of
people; consequently, population-wide preventive
interventions have been proposed for all elderly
people.21

However, the dilemma for primary prevention is
that whereas the population attributable risk is large,
the absolute individual risk is still low.22 The risk-benefit
balance for community based prevention differs from
that for intervention in clinically defined groups.
Safety, feasibility, and cost effectiveness are crucial. Side
effects are less acceptable in a healthy group in which
the risk of fracture is not high. This is a particular issue
in men, in whom evidence on effective fracture prevention is lacking. Many interventions effective in high risk
groups are not feasible in the general population
owing to poor compliance or side effects or are not
cost effective.23 In contrast, the cost of four monthly
oral 100 000 IU vitamin D is minimal ( < £1 annually).


**Conclusion**
We found a single oral 100 000 IU dose of vitamin D
four monthly to be acceptable, safe, and effective in
reducing the incidence of fracture in men and women
aged over 65 living in the general community.

We thank all the participants in the trial from the British doctors
study and the general practice in Ipswich. We also thank A J
Hicks and colleagues at the Norwich Road Surgery, Ipswich; G
Hanson, Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust Pharmacy Manufacturing
Department; Richard Dexter, Pelican Computing, for computing support; Rosemary Reader and Sandra Owen for database
assistance; and Sir Richard Peto for advice and access to the
British doctors. The 100 000 IU vitamin D supplement or
placebo used in this trial was specially prepared by the Ipswich
Hospital Pharmacy. Ergocalciferol (physiologically the same
action as cholecalciferol) 50 000 IU is obtainable from chemists.
