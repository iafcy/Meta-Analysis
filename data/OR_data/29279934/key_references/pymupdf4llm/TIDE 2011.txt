Abstract
Aims/objective Conflicting data regarding cardiovascular
effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and extra-skeletal
effects of vitamin D supported the need for a definitive
trial. The Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D
Evaluation (TIDE) trial aimed to assess the effects of TZDs
(rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) on cardiovascular outcomes and the effects of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) on
cancers and mortality.
Methods A large multicentre 3×2 factorial double-blind
placebo-controlled randomised trial recruited from outpatient
primary care and specialty clinics in 33 countries. From June
2009 to July 2010, 1,332 people with type 2 diabetes and other
cardiovascular risk factors aged ≥50 years whose HbA1c was

6.5–9.5% (48–80 mmol/mol) when using two or fewer
glucose-lowering drugs were randomised by a central
computer system to placebo (n=541), rosiglitazone 4–
8 mg/day (n=399) or pioglitazone 30–45 mg/day (n=392);
1,221 participants were randomised to placebo (n=614) or
vitamin D 1,000 IU/day (n=607). Participants and all study
personnel were blind to treatment allocation. The
primary outcome for the TZD arm was the composite
of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death,
and for the vitamin D arm it was cancer or all-cause
death. All randomised participants were included in the
primary analysis.
Results From the study design, 16,000 people were to be
followed for approximately 5.5 years. However, the trial
was stopped prematurely because of regulatory concerns
after a mean of 162 days without consideration of the
accrued data. In the TZD arm, the cardiovascular outcome
occurred in five participants (0.9%) in the placebo groups
and three participants (0.4%) in the TZD groups (two
allocated to pioglitazone, one to rosiglitazone). In the
vitamin D arm, the primary outcome occurred in three
participants (0.5%) in the placebo group and in two
participants (0.3%) receiving vitamin D. Adverse events
were comparable in all groups.
Conclusions/interpretation Uncertainty persists regarding
the clinically relevant risks and benefits of TZDs and
vitamin D because of the early cancellation of this
comprehensive trial.

Background

The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) rosiglitazone and pioglitazone lower glucose levels without causing hypoglycaemia

[1]. They also reduce many other cardiovascular risk factors
including: incident diabetes [2, 3]; insulin resistance [4, 5];
blood pressure [6]; albuminuria [7]; renal disease [8, 9];
inflammatory markers [10]; revascularisation after percutaneous coronary intervention [11]; and carotid [3, 12–14]
and coronary atherosclerosis [15, 16]. These observations
and analyses of data from administrative databases in 2005
show that people prescribed TZDs may have fewer
cardiovascular events or deaths than people prescribed
other agents [17, 18] and suggest that TZDs may improve
cardiovascular outcomes. This hypothesis gained support
from trials showing that: (1) insulin-sensitising therapies
(comprising mainly rosiglitazone plus metformin) had
effects on mortality and cardiovascular events comparable
with those of insulin-providing therapies in people with
diabetes and proven coronary artery disease [19]; (2) the
cardiovascular effects of rosiglitazone in combination with
either metformin or a sulfonylurea were similar to those of
metformin plus a sulfonylurea [20]; and (3) pioglitazone
non-significantly reduced cardiovascular events compared
with a placebo [21]. However, the limitations of the
methods of the latter two trials [22–24], the higher risk of
heart failure with TZDs [25], analyses of other administrative
databases, and inconclusive meta-analyses of mainly small
trials comprising few events [26–30] raised uncertainty
regarding the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone and the
effects of the TZDs as a class. Collectively, these observations highlighted the need for a definitive trial testing the
hypothesis that TZDs may improve cardiovascular outcomes
in patients with diabetes and other cardiovascular risk
factors.
Emerging evidence suggests that type 2 diabetes is
associated with low levels of vitamin D [31], and a growing
body of evidence links vitamin D deficiency to many of the
chronic diseases that occur in people with diabetes,
including cancer [32] and cardiovascular disease [33, 34].
The possibility that vitamin D supplementation may reduce
these risks was suggested by a recent meta-analysis of 18
randomised controlled trials in which a mean of 528 IU/day
of vitamin D reduced total mortality by 7% over a mean of


5.7 years [35]. This, and evidence of a neutral effect of
400 IU/day on cancers and cardiovascular outcomes [36–
38] and a beneficial effect of 1,100 IU/day on cancer risk

[39], suggest that higher doses of vitamin D might improve
health outcomes in people with diabetes.
The Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D
Evaluation (TIDE) trial was designed to explicitly determine
whether the TZDs and/or vitamin D can safely reduce
clinically important outcomes. It was designed by an
international scientific committee of ten experts in clinical
trials, diabetes and cardiovascular disease plus a representative from the sponsor (GlaxoSmithKline—the manufacturer
of rosiglitazone), with input from representatives of the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who approved the final
design. Global implementation of TIDE was led by this group
and 35 other experts. It was subsequently approved by a total
of 33 regulatory agencies and 525 research ethics committees
in 33 countries. Its progress and safety were monitored by an
independent data-monitoring committee of five international
experts. Notwithstanding these approvals and safeguards,
there was ongoing public controversy regarding the safety of
rosiglitazone [40], prompted by a US Senate Committee
report [41], and an advisory board was convened by the
FDA [42, 43]. On 21 July 2010, the FDA suspended
recruitment into the trial, and on 23 September 2010 it
required withdrawal of treatment for all participants enrolled
in the TIDE trial. This paper reports the course of the TIDE
trial and its accrued outcomes by treatment group in the
context of these decisions.

Methods

TIDE was a 3×2 factorial double-blind randomised
placebo-controlled trial. Volunteers were enrolled from
primary care, diabetes and cardiology clinics if they had
type 2 diabetes and an HbA1c level ranging from 6.5% to
9.5% (48 to 80 mmol/mol), were drug-naive or taking up to
two non-insulin glucose-lowering medications, and were at
risk of cardiovascular disease on the basis of: (1) age at
least 50 years with a prior cardiovascular event; (2) age at
least 55 years with documented arterial stenosis, albuminuria,
ankle brachial index <0.9 or left ventricular hypertrophy; or
(3) age at least 60 years with at least two risk factors (tobacco
use, high LDL-cholesterol, low HDL-cholesterol or high
triacylglycerols, hypertension or obesity). Key exclusion
criteria were a cardiovascular event within 30 days before
randomisation, history of pulmonary oedema, symptomatic
heart failure (New York Heart Association class II–IV),
known left ventricular ejection fraction below 40% or use of
a loop diuretic, cancer diagnosed in the prior 3 years or active
treatment for cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or
cervical carcinoma in situ), fracture in the prior year, known

osteomalacia, or hypercalcaemia. The protocol and consent
forms were approved by ethics committees at all recruiting
centres, and all participants provided written informed
consent.
After 3 weeks of active rosiglitazone and vitamin D
(cholecalciferol) run-in, participants were randomised by a
central phone-in computer system to placebo, pioglitazone
30 mg daily or rosiglitazone 4 mg daily at a 4:3:3 ratio.
Doses were to be increased to pioglitazone 45 mg daily or
rosiglitazone 8 mg daily by 12 months. Independent of their
TZD allocation, participants were also randomised to
placebo or vitamin D, 1,000 IU daily, in a 1:1 ratio. Due
to manufacturing delays, the vitamin D study drug was not
available at the start of the trial. Thus approximately 40%
of the vitamin D participants were randomised to the
vitamin D arm after randomisation to the TZD arm. The
management of glucose levels and all other conditions was
at the discretion of the local physician as informed by
clinical practice guidelines and the relevant evidence; openlabel TZDs were not permitted. Study visits were conducted
2 and 6 months after randomisation and every 6 months
thereafter.
The primary outcome measure for the TZD arm was the
first occurrence of the composite of myocardial infarction,
stroke or cardiovascular death, and for the vitamin D arm it
was all-cause death or cancers requiring hospitalisation,
chemotherapy or surgery. Other outcomes included a
composite microvascular outcome (the first occurrence of
retinopathy requiring laser therapy or vitrectomy, or a 30%
decline in estimated GFR [eGFR], or need for renal
replacement therapy) for the TZD arm, and hospitalisation
for heart failure, pneumonia or shortness of breath,
hospitalisation for any reason, revascularisation and fractures for both study arms. All outcomes except decline in
eGFR and hospitalisation for any reason were adjudicated
according to prespecified criteria, without knowledge of
study-group allocation.
Serum calcium was measured at baseline, at 2 months
and at the annual and end-of-study visits. Fasting lipids,
serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were
measured at baseline and end-of-study visits. Fasting
plasma glucose and HbA1c were measured at baseline,
after 1 year and at the end-of-study visits. All blood tests
were assayed locally. To facilitate cross-site comparisons,
if the upper limit of normal for the locally measured
HbA1c result was not 6% (42 mmol/mol), the measured
value was divided by the upper limit of normal and
multiplied by 6%. HbA1c values measured using the
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry or related
methods were converted to the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial-National Glycohaemoglobin Standardisation Program (DCCT-NGSP) values using published
regression equations [44].


Statistical analysis Sample size calculations showed that
16,000 participants would provide approximately 90%
power to detect a 20% or greater reduction in the primary
outcome of TZDs vs placebo, assuming an annual event
rate of 2%, 2 years of recruitment, 5.5 years of follow-up,
and a two-sided α between 0.025 and 0.05. This sample
size would include 10,888 people randomised to either
rosiglitazone or placebo and would exclude a 30% excess
of events with rosiglitazone compared with placebo using a
one-sided α level of 0.0125 during a safety analysis after
4.5 years. The study would also have 90% power to detect a
26% reduction in mortality or serious cancer with vitamin
D over 5.5 years and 18% over 10 years assuming an event
rate of this composite outcome of 1% per year.
Data were collected, stored and analysed centrally at the
Population Health Research Institute project office independent of the sponsor. Statistical analyses were conducted
using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute). All group
comparisons were done according to the intention-to-treat
approach. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses were
planned. However, following early termination of the trial
and prior to unblinding, the scientific committee determined that such analyses would be inappropriate because of
the small numbers of outcomes. Characteristics of participants at baseline and at the end of the study are tabulated
as means±SD or number (percentage) and end-of-study
comparisons were made by Student’s t tests or χ[2] tests.
Incidence rates of primary outcomes, secondary outcomes
and any safety events were calculated by dividing the
number of individuals experiencing an event by the personyears of follow-up (from randomisation to the time of an
event or censoring).

Results

The first participant was randomised in June 2009. By the
end of January 2010 a total of 143 randomised individuals,
157 centres, and 18 countries were participating, and by the
end of February when the US Senate report was released,
this had risen rapidly to 204 participants, 202 centres,
and 20 countries. By the time recruitment was suspended at the end of July 2010, 455 centres located in
33 countries were eligible to recruit participants.
However, despite the addition of 253 centres with ethics
approvals after February, the proportion of centres that
were screening participants subsequently decreased
(Fig. 1). Thus, a total of 1332 participants were ultimately
randomised in only 175 of the 455 centres to the TZD arm
(541 to placebo, 392 to pioglitazone, and 399 to
rosiglitazone) and 1,221 to the vitamin D arm (614 to
placebo and 607 to vitamin D). Figure 1 illustrates the

numbers of participating countries, participating centres
and randomised participants by month. During the trial,
six participants died, two participants were lost-to-followup, and ten participants withdrew consent. All other
participants were followed until the end of the study, and
vital status was known for 1,320 (99.1%) participants. The
disposition of participants by treatment group is shown in
Fig. 2a, b.


Baseline characteristics of participants were similar
across allocated groups (Table 1). The mean age of
participants was 66.4±6.6 years, 41% were women and
35% had prior cardiovascular disease. The mean duration of
diabetes was 8.8±6.9 years and the mean HbA1c was 7.4±
0.9% (57±10 mmol/mol). Mean duration of follow-up was
162 days (i.e. 590 person-years) for the TZD arm and
130 days (i.e. 546 person-years) for the vitamin D arm. Of
the 1325 surviving participants contacted before it was
announced that the trial would be stopped, 90% (n=1,187)
and 91% (n=1,018) were at least 80% adherent to the TZD
and vitamin D study drugs, respectively (91% to
placebo [n=487], 87% to pioglitazone [n=341], and
91% to rosiglitazone [n=359]; 92% to placebo [n=519]
and 91% to vitamin D [n=499]). A mean of 2.2% of
participants stopped the study drug per month before the
Senate report was publicised, whereas a mean of 2.5% of
participants stopped the study drug per month in the
3 months prior to the announcement of trial termination.
Between that announcement and the end-of-study visit,
participants were stopping the study drug at a high rate of
18% per month; thus by the end-of-study visit, 39% of
participants had stopped the TZD study drug (n=516) and
34% had stopped the vitamin D study drug (n=417). The
most common reasons for stopping the TZD study drug
either temporarily or permanently during the trial were
hearing that the trial was terminated (56%, n =288),
adverse events (22%, n=115) and fear of adverse events
(12%, n=62). The most common reasons for stopping the
vitamin D study drug were hearing the trial was
terminated (69%, n=288), adverse events (13%, n=56)
and fear of adverse events (5%, n=21).
Adjudicated outcomes are presented in Table 2 and
the outcomes as reported (i.e. prior to adjudication) are
shown in Electronic supplementary material (ESM)
Table 1. The primary composite cardiovascular outcome
occurred in five (0.9%) participants in the placebo group
and three (0.4%) participants in the TZD group (two
allocated to pioglitazone and one allocated to rosiglitazone). The primary outcome for the vitamin D study (allcause mortality or serious cancers) occurred in three
(0.5%) placebo group participants and two (0.3%)
vitamin D group participants.
Physical measurements, metabolic variables and use of
concomitant glucose-lowering medications at the end of the
trial are shown in Table 3. Compared with placebo,
participants randomised to a TZD (pioglitazone and
rosiglitazone groups combined) achieved lower HbA1c
(6.9% vs 7.3% [52 vs 56 mmol/mol], p<0.001), fasting
plasma glucose (7.2 vs 8.0 mmol/l, p<0.001) and ALT (25
vs 27 U/l, p=0.006), and increased their weight (88.0 vs
85.2 kg, p=0.008) and BMI (31.5 vs 30.4 kg/m[2], p=0.001).
Compared with pioglitazone, the rosiglitazone group had

Fig. 2 Trial profiles of participants based on allocation to (a) the TZD
arm, and (b) the vitamin D arm. Multiple reasons are possible for
excluded or non-completed individuals. The 111 participants rando
slightly higher HbA1c (7.0% vs 6.8% [53 vs 51 mmol/mol],
p =0.024), and also higher triacylglycerols (2.10 vs
1.67 mmol/l, p<0.001), and lower HDL-cholesterol (1.19
vs 1.27 mmol/l, p=0.003) at the end of the trial. The use of
statins, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers,
anti-platelet agents, diuretics and nitrates were similar at the
end of the trial (data not shown). Vitamin D did not affect
physical measurements, biochemistry (including serum
calcium) or concomitant medication use.
Severe hypoglycaemia (i.e. hypoglycaemia requiring
assistance from another person, with either a documented
plasma glucose≤2.0 mmol/l or prompt recovery after oral
carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administration) occurred in none of the participants in the placebo
group, two (0.5%) in the pioglitazone group and one (0.3%)
in the rosiglitazone group. Hospital admission for congestive heart failure occurred in one (0.2%) participant in the
placebo group, two (0.5%) in the pioglitazone group and
none in the rosiglitazone group. Fractures occurred in two
(0.4%) participants in the placebo group, two (0.5%) in the
pioglitazone group and three (0.8%) in the rosiglitazone
group. Severe adverse events were reported in seven
placebo participants, five pioglitazone participants and
two rosiglitazone participants, and in the vitamin D arm,
by two placebo participants and nine vitamin D participants. Serious adverse events, tabulated in ESM Table 2,
included two cardiovascular, three respiratory, two gastrointestinal, three genitourinary, one multi-organ failure, one
pruritic allergic and two hypoglycaemic events. Each
specific serious adverse event type occurred in only one
person, except for hypoglycaemia which was reported in
two participants.

because the vitamin D study drug was not available at the time of
study termination

Discussion

The purpose of the TIDE trial was to elucidate the effect of
TZDs on cardiovascular events while also elucidating the
effect of vitamin D on cancer and death in people with type
2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. TIDE was
designed to recruit 16,000 participants over 2 years and
would have included 816 sites in 39 countries once all sites
were activated. Based on the observed recruitment rates in
early 2010, plans to add more sites, and ongoing support
for continuation of the trial by the unblinded Independent
Data Monitoring Committee, it is likely that recruitment
would have rapidly increased until its completion in mid
2011. However, the heated political debate, global coverage
and public controversy surrounding both the trial and
rosiglitazone attenuated recruitment and led to randomisation of only 1,332 of the planned 16,000 participants by
the time recruitment was stopped. Eight of these 1,332
suffered the composite primary outcome during a mean
follow-up period of just 0.4 years of receiving TZD study
drug—a number from which no conclusions can be drawn.
The TZDs both reduced HbA1c and ALT levels and
increased weight, whereas pioglitazone but not rosiglitazone modestly reduced triacylglycerol and raised HDLcholesterol levels compared with placebo.
Uncertainty will persist regarding clinically relevant
risks and benefits of either rosiglitazone or pioglitazone.
Indeed, clinical equipoise regarding the cardiovascular
effects of the TZDs prompted the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology to advocate
jointly the conduct of definitive cardiovascular outcomes
trials such as TIDE as recently as 2010 [22]. Such trials are

DPP4, dipeptidylpeptidase


those that are large and continue for long enough to
generate reliable results by accruing more than 1,000
primary outcomes [45–47]. Without such trials, some
therapies that are now known to be harmful would have
been promoted because they were considered to be
beneficial based on weaker evidence (e.g. suppression of
ventricular premature beats after a myocardial infarction

[48]) whereas other therapies that are now known to be
beneficial would have been abandoned because they were
considered to be harmful based on weaker evidence (e.g.
lowering of systolic blood pressure in the elderly [49] and
beta-blockers in heart failure [50]).
As with the TZDs, no conclusion regarding the
effects of vitamin D on cancers and mortality can be
drawn. Previous randomised trials were not designed to


assess extra-skeletal effects, or used doses of vitamin D
that were likely inadequate to promote extra-skeletal
effects [37, 39]. Nevertheless, these data and data from
physiological studies have been used to actively promote
its use for such indications. An ongoing trial of 20,000
people (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01169259) is likely to
resolve this uncertainty.
The strengths of TIDE were its placebo-controlled
design, large size, inclusion of a research question
regarding vitamin D in addition to the TZD questions,
safety oversight by an independent data monitoring
committee and independent scientific leadership. Its main
weakness was its timing. Had it been initiated earlier it is
likely that its results would have pre-empted premature
conclusions and claims by various organisations and


-----

individuals regarding the efficacy and safety of rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. Indeed, the results would have
provided clear evidence to inform medical care. The history
of TIDE therefore highlights the importance of conducting
well-designed outcomes trials such as TIDE early in the
lifecycle of drugs that are likely to be used for the ongoing
treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes.
