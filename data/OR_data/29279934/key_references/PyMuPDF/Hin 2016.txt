Abstract
Summary This trial compared the effects of daily treatment
with vitamin D or placebo for 1 year on blood tests of vitamin
D status. The results demonstrated that daily 4000 IU vitamin
D3 is required to achieve blood levels associated with lowest
disease risks, and this dose should be tested in future trials for
fracture prevention.
Introduction The aim of this trial was to assess the effects of
daily supplementation with vitamin D3 4000 IU (100 μg),
2000 IU (50 μg) or placebo for 1 year on biochemical markers
of vitamin D status in preparation for a large trial for preven-
tion of fractures and other outcomes.
Methods This is a randomized placebo-controlled trial in 305
community-dwelling people aged 65 years or older in
Oxfordshire, UK. Outcomes included biochemical markers of
vitamin D status (plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25[OH]D],
parathyroid hormone [PTH], calcium and alkaline phosphatase),
cardiovascular risk factors and tests of physical function.
Results Mean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were 50 (18)
nmol/L at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and
53 (16) nmol/L after 12 months in those allocated 4000 IU,
2000 IU or placebo, respectively (with 88%, 70% and 1% of
these groups achieving the pre-specified level of >90 nmol/L).
Neither dose of vitamin D3 was associated with significant
deviation outside the normal range of PTH or albumin-
corrected calcium. The additional effect on 25(OH)D levels
of 4000 versus 2000 IU was similar in all subgroups except for
body mass index, for which the further increase was smaller in
overweight and obese participants compared with normal-
weight participants. Supplementation with vitamin D had no
significant effects on cardiovascular risk factors or on mea-
sures of physical function.
Conclusions After accounting for average 70% compliance in
long-term trials, doses of 4000 IU vitamin D3 daily may be
required to achieve plasma 25(OH)D levels associated with
lowest disease risk in observational studies.

Introduction
About half of all women and one fifth of all men aged 50 years
or older will experience a fracture in their lifetime, due chiefly
to underlying osteoporosis [1]. Osteoporosis is characterized
by decreased bone mass and typically presents with fractures
of the wrist, spine and hip [2]. Observational studies indicate
that low plasma levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25[OH]D), a
widely used marker of vitamin D status, are associated with
higher risks of osteoporosis [3, 4] and fractures [5, 6], in ad-
dition to vascular and non-vascular mortality [6, 7]. While
correction of severe vitamin D deficiency is protective against

rickets in children [8] and osteomalacia in adults [9], there is
substantial uncertainty about whether vitamin D supplemen-
tation in individuals with moderate vitamin D insufficiency
can prevent osteoporotic fracture or other disease outcomes.
Previous trials [10–17] and meta-analyses of trials [18–21],
assessing the effects of equivalent daily doses of 400–
800 IU (10–20 μg) of vitamin D on risk of fracture, have
reported conflicting results. However, no large trials for dis-
ease prevention have used doses of vitamin D sufficient to
achieve and maintain plasma levels of 25(OH)D associated
with the lowest risks of mortality and fractures reported in
observational studies [6, 7]. Moreover, a recent systematic
review of vitamin D and multiple health outcomes concluded
that there was no consensus on the optimal dose or plasma
level of 25(OH)D for disease prevention [22]. Dose-finding
trials are required to interpret the results of the ongoing trials
and to design a large trial of higher doses of vitamin D for
disease prevention in older people.
Observational studies suggest that the lowest risks of mor-
tality and morbidity are associated with plasma 25(OH)D
levels around 90 nmol/L (36 ng/mL) [23]; this is also the level
typically found in young British adults at the end of the sum-
mer months [24] and in people living in high sun-exposed
regions [25, 26] and the levels associated with the lowest risks
of vascular and non-vascular mortality in older people [6, 7].
In addition, plasma levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) are
inversely associated with plasma levels of 25(OH)D up to
levels of about 70–100 nmol/L [27–29]. Previous trials have
demonstrated that the effects of supplementation with 400 IU
(10 μg) of vitamin D would only increase plasma 25(OH)D
levels by 7–10 nmol/L [28, 29], but with typical compliance
observed in long-term trials of vitamin D for disease preven-
tion [15], only about 70% of this effect might be seen. Since
the average plasma 25(OH)D levels in older people in the UK
are about 50 nmol/L in the summer months (and much lower
in winter), daily doses of 400 to 800 IU would not be sufficient
to achieve and maintain plasma 25(OH)D levels >90 nmol/L
throughout the year [28, 29].
The aims of the Biochemical Efficacy and Safety Trial of
vitamin D (BEST-D) were to compare the effects of daily
supplementation with either 4000 IU vitamin D or 2000 IU
vitamin D or placebo on biochemical markers of vitamin D
status in order to determine the optimum dose to use in a large
randomized trial for the prevention of fractures and other
health outcomes in older people living in the UK. The trial
also investigated the effects of vitamin D on cardiovascular
risk factors and on clinical tests of physical function.
Materials and methods
The study design and pre-specified data analysis plan for the
BEST-D trial have been previously reported [30]. In summary,
BEST-D is a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled,
parallel group trial comparing the effects of daily supplemen-
tation with either 4000 IU (100 μg) or 2000 IU (50 μg) cho-
lecalciferol (vitamin D3) or placebo for 12 months on bio-
chemical markers of vitamin D status, cardiovascular risk fac-
tors and clinical tests of physical function [29]. About 300
men and women aged 65 years or older were recruited from
a single general practice in Banbury, Oxfordshire, UK.
Individuals who were ambulatory, living in the community
and not currently taking more than 400 IU (10 μg) vitamin
D3 daily were eligible to participate. All participants provided
written informed consent, and the study was approved by the
National Research Ethics Service Committee (Oxford B), UK.
All trial investigators, trial staff and participants were kept
blinded to the treatment allocation until the trial had been
completed, the data analysis plan had been finalized and the
database had been locked for analysis.
Randomization and interventions
A research nurse visited participants at home and recorded a
history of vascular disease or presence of vascular risk factors,
falls and fractures and daily dietary intake of calcium; assessed
symptoms of muscle and joint pain (using a ten-point visual
scale with 10 being the most severe); and measured height,
weight, blood pressure, arterial stiffness and handgrip strength
(average of 3 measures on each hand) with a Jamar dynamom-
eter [31]. Blood pressure and arterial stiffness were also mea-
sured at each visit after 10-min rest in the seated position [32].
First, a finger probe (PulseTrace PCA 2) was placed on the
right forefinger to record the digital volume pulse using
photoplethysmography over 30–60 s. This was followed by
recording the mean of two blood pressure and brachial artery
arterial stiffness measurements (aortic pulse wave velocity
[PWV] and aortic augmentation index) made over 2 min using
a TensioClinicTM® Arteriograph [33]. Blood was collected
into vacutainers containing either lithium heparin or ethylene-
diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for analyses. Randomization
to study treatment (vitamin D3 4000 or 2000 IU or placebo
daily) was by telephone to the coordinating centre where a
computer-based minimization algorithm was used to ensure
matching of the allocated groups by age, body mass index
[BMI], smoking history, ethnicity and history of fracture.
Vitamin D3 and matching placebo soft gel capsules were pro-
vided by Tishcon Corporation (Westbury, NY, USA).
Follow-up visits
All participants were visited again in their homes by the study
nurse at 6 and 12 months after randomization. In addition, one
third of the participants were randomly selected to have a blood
sample collected at 1 month. At the 6- and 12-month visits,
information was recorded on compliance, serious adverse
Osteoporos Int

events, non-serious adverse events leading to discontinuation of
study treatment, symptoms of muscle and joint pain, measures
of physical function (handgrip strength) [34, 35] and mood
(using the geriatric depression four-point scale) [36, 37], and a
blood sample was collected. The participants were asked to
attend a single assessment centre at their local general practice
after their 12-month assessment to have clinical tests of physical
function (chair rises, tests of balance and a 3-m walk) [34, 35]
and for bone density at the heel and wrist bones measured using
an OsteoSys EXA-300 scanner (OsteoSys, Seoul, Korea).
Biochemical analyses
Plasma levels of 25(OH)D were selected as the best measure
of vitamin D status rather than 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D be-
cause of its long half-life and direct relationship to intake and
synthesis. Plasma 25(OH)D levels and plasma PTH were
measured using an Access 2 immunoassay analyzer
(Beckman Coulter Ltd., High Wycombe, England). The labo-
ratory participated in the international DEQAS scheme for
25(OH)D and had a mean (SD) bias of −11.8% (7.5) from
the target value over the period of the study. The performance
target for the scheme was ±25% of the target value, which is
assigned by the NIST reference measurement procedure.
Plasma levels of albumin, calcium, phosphate and alkaline
phosphatase were measured using a UniCel DxC 800
Synchron clinical system (Beckman Coulter Ltd., High
Wycombe, England), and plasma levels of high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein were measured using a BN ProSpec system
(Siemens, Frimley, England); all assays used the suppliers’
reagents and calibrators. Further details of assays and perfor-
mance characteristics are recorded in the Online Resource.
Statistical analyses
All efficacy and safety assessments were conducted ac-
cording to the intention-to-treat principle and followed
the pre-specified data analyses set out in the trial
Statistical Analysis Plan [30]. The co-primary outcomes
were mean plasma 25(OH)D levels and the percentage of
participants with plasma 25(OH)D levels >90 nmol/L at
12 months. The primary assessment of these outcomes
was to compare participants allocated 4000 IU with those
allocated 2000 IU daily (with secondary assessments in-
cluding comparisons of each dose with placebo). Tertiary
assessments of the co-primary outcomes involved com-
parison of the two active doses of vitamin D in the fol-
lowing subgroups: sex, age (<70, ≥70 years), body mass
index (BMI <25, ≥25 to <30, ≥30 kg/m2), plasma
25(OH)D level at baseline (≤50, >50 nmol/L), dietary
calcium intake (≤700, >700 mg/day), estimated glomeru-
lar filtration rate (eGFR ≤75, >75 ml/min/1.73 m2) and
history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). A range of
secondary and tertiary outcomes were also pre-specified,
including mean 25(OH)D and percentage of participants
with 25(OH)D >90 nmol/L at 1 and 6 months; percentage
of participants with PTH in the reference interval at 1, 6
and 12 months; percentage of participants with calcium
above the reference interval at 1, 6 and 12 months; mean
values of all other biochemical tests and measures of vas-
cular function at 6 and 12 months; and physical function
at 12 months. Comparisons of mean follow-up values be-
tween treatment arms involved analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) adjusted, where possible, for the baseline val-
ue (with multiple imputation used to impute the few miss-
ing data). ANCOVA provides a more powerful test of the
null hypothesis than either a comparison of mean follow-
up values in isolation or a comparison of mean changes
from baseline [38]. Comparisons of dichotomous out-
comes were done using standard methods for 2 × 2 con-
tingency tables. All p values were two sided and consid-
ered statistically significant, without allowance for multi-
ple testing, if they were <0.05 [39]. Analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.3 and R version 2.11.1. The
study was designed to have >90% power (at 2p=0.01) to
detect a true difference in mean 25(OH)D between the
two active doses at 12 months of 11 nmol/L (assuming
an SD of 20 nmol/L). In the two active dose arms, it also
had >80% power at 2p=0.05 to detect an increase in the
proportion achieving a 12-month concentration >90 nmol/
L from 60% to 80%. All of the analyses were conducted
independently of the sources of support.
Results
Figure 1 shows the outcome of the 1122 people who were
assessed for eligibility for invitation to participate in the trial.
Between 24 September 2012 and 14 March 2013, 305 partic-
ipants were randomly allocated to take either 4000 IU D3
(n = 102), 2000 IU D3 (n = 102) or placebo (n = 101) daily.
Baseline characteristics
The mean age was 72 years, 51% were men, and 7% were
current smokers (Table 1). About 12% reported taking low-
dose vitamin D3 (400 IU daily or less), and 3% reported using
calcium supplements. While the self-reported physical activity
ratings were high, one third of participants reported muscle
aches and pains and two thirds reported joint aches and pains.
Compliance
Among those allocated to 4000 IU, 2000 IU or placebo, 93%,
93% and 87%, respectively, reported taking their capsules on
all or most days at 6 months, while 90, 92 and 85% reported
doing so at the 12-month visit. Overall, only 5%, 4% and 6%
Osteoporos Int

of those allocated to 4000 IU, 2000 IU or placebo were unable
to attend their scheduled final visits (Fig. 1).
Effects on plasma 25(OH)D levels
Mean (SD) plasma 25(OH)D levels were about 50 (18) nmol/L
at baseline and increased to 137 (39), 102 (25) and 53 (16) nmol/
L respectively, after 12 months of treatment among those allo-
cated 4000 IU, 2000 IU or placebo, respectively (Fig. 2, Table 2),
and 88%, 70% and 1%, respectively, achieved a 25(OH)D level
>90 nmol/L at 12 months. Figure 2 shows the mean plasma
levels of 25(OH)D when measured on three to four visits over
12 months. In the 100 participants evaluated at 1 month, mean
plasma 25(OH)D levels were already significantly elevated
(Fig. 2). By 6 months, 86% and 64% of participants allocated
to 4000 and 2000 IU vitamin D, respectively, had plasma
25(OH)D >90 nmol/L (compared with 2% of placebo-allocated
participants). Between 6 and 12 months, the 25(OH)D mean
levels continued to increase by 11 nmol/L and 5 nmol/L,
respectively.
Effects in pre-specified subgroups
The effects of 4000 IU daily versus 2000 IU daily of vitamin
D on plasma levels of 25(OH)D after 12 months were similar
in all pre-specified subgroups, except when grouped by BMI,
where the further increase from the higher dose on plasma
25(OH)D levels was smaller among those with higher base-
line BMI (Fig. 3: p for trend <0.0001). The effects of 4000
versus 2000 IU dose of vitamin D on plasma levels of
25(OH)D were attenuated by one third in those who were
overweight and by two thirds in those who were obese, com-
pared with those with normal BMI. In a post hoc analysis of
the effects of 2000 IU vitamin D versus placebo, however, the
achieved difference in plasma 25(OH)D levels was similar in
every subgroup, including by baseline BMI (Online Resource
Fig. 1). The achieved differences in plasma levels of 25(OH)D
at 6 and 12 months between those allocated 4000 versus
2000 IU daily and versus placebo were broadly similar when
subdivided by the quartiles of plasma 25(OH)D levels at base-
line (Online Resource Table 1).

Effects on plasma PTH, calcium levels and alkaline
phosphatase
Plasma levels of PTH at baseline were balanced by treatment
allocation but were outside the laboratory normal range (1.1–
6.8 pmol/L) in 22 participants. During follow-up, the proportion
of participants with plasma PTH levels within the normal range
was similar between those allocated 4000 IU daily, 2000 IU
daily or placebo (respectively, 89%, 95% and 88% at 6 months
and 91%, 95% and 87% at 12 months). Compared with placebo,
mean PTH decreased significantly (p < 0.0001) with both doses
of vitamin D (Fig. 2, Table 2), with lower mean plasma PTH
levels at 6 and 12 months among participants allocated 4000 IU
compared with participants allocated 2000 IU daily (p = 0.01
and p = 0.03, respectively). The reduction from baseline in
plasma PTH levels at 12 months was 22% in the 4000 IU group
and 14% in the 2000 IU group. Mean plasma levels of albumin-
corrected calcium were also significantly increased by both vi-
tamin D3 doses (Fig. 2, Table 2), but the absolute increases were
small and not clinically apparent. The differences in 6- and 12-
month plasma levels of albumin-corrected calcium between par-
ticipants allocated 4000 IU daily and those allocated 2000 IU
daily were also small (Table 2) and did not vary by baseline
plasma levels of albumin-corrected calcium (Online Resource

Table 2). Likewise, vitamin D3 had no significant effect on
mean plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase at 12 months
(Table 2). In post hoc analyses, there was no evidence that
baseline plasma levels of plasma 25(OH)D modified the effect
of allocation to vitamin D on 12-month alkaline phosphatase
levels (p for interaction 0.89).

gives the estimates at 6 months. Allocation to either dose of
vitamin D3 had no significant effect on the physical measure-
ments or measures of arterial stiffness at 12 months or on 12-
month levels of total or LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apoli-
poprotein B, NT-proBNP, phosphate, creatinine or urinary
albumin/creatinine ratio (Table 3). Mean plasma levels of
HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, C-reactive protein and
albumin at 12 months were all slightly, but significantly, lower
among participants allocated vitamin D3 (without allowing
for multiple testing).
There were no significant differences in the reported
clinical or adverse events with any vitamin D3 intake
versus placebo on clinical events at 12 months or on
self-reported fractures, falls, muscle pain severity, joint
pain severity and physical activity ratings compared with
those allocated to placebo (Table 3). Geriatric depression
scores were also similar in both groups, as were the re-
sults of measures of physical function including handgrip
strength, chair rises, balance and a 3-m walk. Moreover,
the results of these clinical events and physical measures
were similar at 6 months (Online Resource Table 3) and
when the three treatment arms were considered separately
(Online Resource Table 4). Bone density T-scores at the
heel and wrist after 12 months were also broadly similar
between the two groups (the p value of 0.03 for a lower
heel T-score associated with allocation to vitamin D3
would not be statistically significant if allowance was
made for multiple testing and levels at baseline were not
measured to allow for any baseline imbalance to be
assessed).
Safety and tolerability
At randomization, albumin-corrected calcium was mildly
elevated (>2.55 mmol/L) in eight participants (six who
were subsequently allocated vitamin D3 and two who
were subsequently allocated placebo). By 12 months,
there were no new cases with elevated plasma levels
of albumin-corrected calcium. Among the eight partici-
pants who had marginally elevated plasma levels of
albumin-corrected calcium at baseline, six (five allocat-
ed vitamin D3 and one allocated placebo) still had ele-
vated levels at 12 months, but none was considered
clinically significant. Mean plasma levels of creatinine

(data not shown).
At least one serious adverse event (SAE) was reported by
29 participants allocated 4000 IU, 30 allocated 2000 IU of
vitamin D and 25 allocated placebo (Online Resource
Table 5), respectively, and included three deaths (all deaths
were among those allocated to placebo). None of the SAEs
was considered treatment-related events. Study treatment tol-
erability was good and was discontinued before the scheduled
end of the study by 17 participants (5 allocated 4000 IU, 5
allocated 2000 IU and 7 allocated placebo). A SAE was at-
tributed as the reason for discontinuation in 3 participants (one
in each group), and a non-SAE was the reason for discontin-
uation in 4 participants (1 allocated 4000 IU and 3 allocated
placebo).

Discussion
The present study demonstrates that supplementation with
4000 IU daily vitamin D3 compared with 2000 IU daily was
associated with a significantly higher proportion of individ-
uals achieving plasma levels of 25(OH)D >90 nmol/L (88%
vs 70%, respectively) after 1 year of treatment. Mean plasma
levels of PTH decreased significantly in both active vitamin D
groups but were significantly lower in those allocated 4000 IU
vitamin D daily compared to 2000 IU at both 6 and 12 months
(albeit the magnitude of these differences was small). The
intake of vitamin D at these high doses was well tolerated
and was not associated with any adverse clinical events at
1 year. No participant developed clinical hypercalcaemia or
kidney stones. Supplementation with these high doses of vi-
tamin D had no detectable effects on cardiovascular risk fac-
tors or on measures of physical function after 1 year of treat-
ment. The effects on biochemical markers of vitamin D status
were consistent with previous studies of the safety of daily
doses of 4000 IU daily vitamin D3 [37–39] and with studies
indicating increases in plasma 25(OH)D levels of only about
7–10 nmol/L per 400 IU daily vitamin D3 [40–43]. The results
of the present trial are also consistent with those of previous
trials indicating significant differences in plasma 25(OH)D
levels between daily doses of 2000 and 4000 IU [40].
Importantly, the trial demonstrated no adverse effects of
higher doses of vitamin D on any of the biochemical param-
eters studied.
Previous randomized trials assessing vitamin D for fracture
prevention typically tested daily doses of 400 to 800 IU (or
equivalent doses administered intermittently) and so, even
with good compliance, would only have increased 25(OH)D
by at most 7–15 nmol/L. Observational studies indicate that a
10 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D is associated with 5–6% lower
risk of any fracture and about 10% lower risk of hip fracture
[6]. Even if half of this effect is reversible in a trial of about
5 years, to detect such modest effects would have required
very large long-term randomized studies with these low doses
of vitamin D. Consequently, the results of previous trials and
meta-analyses of such trials for the prevention of fractures
have been conflicting [12–16, 18, 19, 21]. Overall, previous
trials of vitamin D when administered alone in doses up to the
equivalent of about 1100 IU daily (without supplemental cal-
cium) have not demonstrated any significant effects on hip or
non-vertebral fractures [16, 18, 19]. The findings of the pres-
ent trial suggest that these early trials assessed doses of vita-
min D, which were an order of magnitude too low, and includ-
ed too few people at increased fracture risk to have sufficient
power to detect plausible effects on fracture.
Several large randomized trials are currently testing the ef-
fects of vitamin D at various higher doses on cardiovascular
and other outcomes: 2000 IU daily (VITAL [n = 25,897]) [44];
60,000 IU monthly (D-Health [n = 20,000]) [44]; 100,000 IU
monthly (ViDA [n = 5100]); and 60,000 IU monthly (TIPS3
[n = 5500]); further smaller studies [45, 46] are testing other
doses. However, even in combination, these trials are unlikely
to have sufficient numbers of participants with incident frac-
tures to clearly demonstrate plausible effects on osteoporotic
fractures. Furthermore, large intermittent doses of vitamin D
are associated with higher risks of fracture and falls, while daily
doses may not be. Further large randomized trials, assessing
doses of at least 4000 IU daily on risk of fracture in high-risk
populations, are now required to address this question.
Some observational studies have suggested that plasma
levels of 25(OH)D above 125 nmol/L may be harmful [47],
but such studies cannot exclude reverse causality. The
Institute of Medicine (USA) Committee recommended a die-
tary allowance of 600 IU/day and a daily upper-level intake of
vitamin D of 4000 IU [42]. Moreover, their recent report did
not identify any safety concerns with supplementation with
4000 IU/day over a 1-year period [48]. Nevertheless, the
long-term safety and effectiveness for fracture prevention of
such high doses (and the relevance of high plasma levels of
25[OH]D) can only be reliably tested in large long-term ran-
domized trials.
Based on currently available evidence, the Scientific
Advisory Committee on Nutrition in the UK advocated a ref-
erence nutrient intake of 400 IU vitamin D daily for the gen-
eral population aged over 4 years and an upper limit of
4000 IU/day [43]. Hence, the doses recommended for
assessing in a future large trial by the present study are sub-
stantially larger than the reference nutrient intake and are close
to the recommended upper limit for both the USA and the UK
populations. However, the BEST-D trial reported no adverse
effects of 4000 IU/day on hypercalcaemia or any other of the
biochemical variables studied.
The chief strengths of the present study are that it random-
ized a substantial number of healthy older people who are the
group most at risk of osteoporotic fractures and demonstrated
both acceptability and detailed biochemical safety of these
doses over a 1-year period. Furthermore, both these doses
eliminated the significant seasonal fall in plasma 25(OH)
levels typically observed in this population (data not shown).
The chief limitation of the present study is that almost all the
study participants were Caucasian, so it cannot address any
differential effects of vitamin D by ethnic group. A further
limitation of the trial was that it was unable to address the
effects of vitamin D on free 25(OH)D.
Several of the on-going trials are assessing the effects of
vitamin D on cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality as
their primary outcomes. The mechanisms underlying the as-
sociations between 25(OH)D and vascular and non-vascular
mortality in the observational studies are uncertain, but the
lack of any effects of these two high doses of vitamin D on
the measured cardiovascular risk factors in the present trial
does not support supplementation with vitamin D for
Osteoporos Int

prevention of CVD being mediated through changes in blood
pressure, arterial stiffness, blood lipids or markers of inflam-
mation. Nevertheless, this study cannot exclude any benefits
for CVD prevention beyond 1 year of treatment.
Osteoporosis is a major public health problem that is asso-
ciated with a high burden of fractures, and compelling indirect
evidence implicates chronic vitamin D insufficiency as an
important contributory cause. But previous trials of vitamin
D have failed to reliably test the vitamin D hypothesis of
osteoporosis because the doses of vitamin D tested in such
trials were too low. After taking account of the typical average
70% compliance observed in long-term trials of vitamin sup-
plements for disease prevention [15, 49], the results of the
present study suggest that daily doses of 4000 IU of vitamin
D3 may be required to achieve the high plasma levels of
25(OH)D associated with the lowest risks of mortality in the
observational studies. However, trials testing the effects of
such high doses of vitamin D should be conducted first before
making recommendations on vitamin D supplementation for
disease prevention in older people.
