diabetes: the Calcium and Vitamin D for Diabetes Mellitus (CaDDM)
randomized controlled trial1–4

ABSTRACT
Background: A suboptimal vitamin D and calcium status has been
associated with higher risk of type 2 diabetes in observational stud-
ies, but evidence from trials is lacking.
Objective: We determined whether vitamin D supplementation, with
or without calcium, improved glucose homeostasis in adults at high
risk of diabetes.
Design: Ninety-two adults were randomly assigned in a 2-by-2
factorial-design, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial to receive
either cholecalciferol (2000 IU once daily) or calcium carbonate
(400 mg twice daily) for 16 wk. The primary outcome was the change
in pancreatic b cell function as measured by the disposition index
after an intravenous-glucose-tolerance test. Other outcomes were
acute insulin response, insulin sensitivity, and measures of glycemia.
Results: Participants had a mean age of 57 y, a body mass index
(BMI; in kg/m2) of 32, and glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) of 5.9%.
There was no signiﬁcant vitamin D · calcium interaction on any
outcomes. The disposition index increased in the vitamin D group
and decreased in the no–vitamin D group (adjusted mean change 6
SE: 300 6 130 compared with 2126 6 127, respectively; P = 0.011),
which was explained by an improvement in insulin secretion (62 6
39 compared with 236 6 37 mU · L21 · min, respectively; P = 0.046).
Hb A1c increased less, but nonsigniﬁcantly, in the vitamin D group than
in the no–vitamin D group (0.06 6 0.03% compared with 0.14 6
0.03%, respectively; P = 0.081). There was no signiﬁcant difference
in any outcomes with calcium compared with no calcium.
Conclusion: In adults at risk of type 2 diabetes, short-term supple-
mentation with cholecalciferol improved b cell function and had
a marginal effect on attenuating the rise in Hb A1c. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00436475.

INTRODUCTION
There is accumulating evidence that suggests that altered
vitamin D and calcium homeostasis may play a role in the de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes (1). A potential role of vitamin D
has been hypothesized on the basis of animal studies (2, 3), cross-
sectional studies that showed that low vitamin D status was
associated with prevalent glucose intolerance or diabetes (4), and
observational longitudinal studies that showed that low vitamin D
status was associated with incident type 2 diabetes (5). A po-
tential role for calcium in the development of type 2 diabetes was
indirectly suggested by cross-sectional studies in which high
calcium intake was shown to be inversely associated with body
weight (6–8) or longitudinal observational studies in which cal-
cium intake was inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes
(9, 10). Results from small clinical trials and post hoc analyses
of larger trials on the effect of vitamin D supplementation, with
or without calcium, on glucose homeostasis have been incon-
sistent (5).
The present randomized trial was designed to evaluate the
effects of vitamin D and calcium supplementation alone or in
combination on pancreatic b cell function, insulin sensitivity,
and glucose tolerance in adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes.

randomized trial that examined the effects of vitamin D and
calcium compared with matching placebos on pancreatic b cell
function, insulin sensitivity, and glycemia in adults at risk of
type 2 diabetes or with early type 2 diabetes who received no
pharmacotherapy. The trial was conducted at the Clinical
Translational Research Center at Tufts Medical Center (Boston,
MA) with approval by the Institutional Review Board at Tufts
University, and all participants provided written informed
consent.
Participants and eligibility criteria
Participants were ambulatory adults who were 40 y of age and
with a body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) 25 (23 if Asian) with
glucose intolerance or early diabetes that was deﬁned as a fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) concentration 100 mg/dL or 2-h glucose
concentration 140 mg/dL after 75 g oral dextrose or glycated
hemoglobin (Hb A1c) 5.8%.
Exclusion criteria were BMI .40, Hb A1c .7%, self-reported
diabetes treated with pharmacotherapy, weight change .4 kg
over the previous 6 mo, use of supplements that contained vitamin
D or calcium in 8 wk of screening and an unwillingness to
discontinue supplementation for 2 wk before the study initiation
and
during
the
study,
hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia,
nephrolithiasis, chronic kidney disease, conditions that may have
affected vitamin D or calcium metabolism (eg, sarcoidosis), and
regular visits to tanning booths. To increase the external validity
of the study and because of a lack of consensus in deﬁning optimal
vitamin D status, the plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]
concentration was not an inclusion or exclusion criterion.
Participants were recruited from the greater metropolitan area
in Boston, MA, through direct mailings and print advertisements.
Potential volunteers underwent prescreening over the phone to
derive a diabetes risk score (11). Persons with a high diabetes risk
score who also met inclusion and exclusion criteria were invited
for a full screening (visit 1, ﬁrst baseline visit) where a 75-g
oral-glucose-tolerance test (OGTT) was performed to measure
FPG, 2-h postload plasma glucose (2hPG), and Hb A1c. Eligible
participants returned ’1 wk later (visit 2, second baseline visit)
for a frequently sampled intravenous-glucose-tolerance test
(FSIVGTT) to determine insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity
and calculate pancreatic b cell function (12).
Randomization and intervention
Eligible participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
receive vitamin D [2000 IU (50 lg) cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)/d]
or matching placebo and, within each category, to receive calcium
(800 mg elemental calcium as calcium carbonate in 2 divided
daily doses) or matching placebos consistent with the 2-by-2
factorial design. Consistent with the double-masked design, there
was no prespeciﬁed target goal for the plasma 25(OH)D concen-
tration. Randomization was achieved by permuted blocks (block
size of 4 or 8) by using a computer-generated random-number
sequence with stratiﬁcation by age (,55 or 55 y) and BMI (,30
or 30). The assignment was double masked. Participants were
advised to maintain their usual diet and physical activity and to
avoid taking supplemental vitamin D, calcium, or any other sup-
plements on their own during the study. Vitamin D and matching
placebos were manufactured by Tishcon Corp (Salisbury, MD).
Quality control was conducted at the beginning and once during
the study to ensure that vitamin D pills contain the stated amount
without deterioration over time. Calcium and matching placebos,
as chewable tablets, were manufactured and donated by Glax-
oSmithKline (Parsippany, NJ). At week 16, participants came to
the center twice, separated by 1 wk, for their repeat testing (OGTT
at visit 4; FSIVGTT at visit 5). Physical measurements and fasting
blood specimens were collected at each visit. Safety proﬁle ques-
tionnaires and measurements of serum calcium and phosphorus
were done at the 8- and 16-wk visits.
Ascertainment of exposure and adherence
Vitamin D and calcium intakes were estimated at baseline by
a self-report on the basis of a food-frequency questionnaire (13).
Vitamin D status was assessed at baseline (visit 1) and 16 wk
(visit 5) by measuring plasma 25(OH)D concentrations. Pill
adherence was assessed by a self-report on the basis of pill counts.
Prespeciﬁed outcomes
The primary endpoint was the mean change from baseline to
16 wk in the disposition index, which was the product of insulin
secretion and insulin sensitivity derived from data obtained during
the FSIVGTT (12). Data from the FSIVGTT were analyzed by
using minimal model analysis (MinMod Millennium, version 5.18;
MinMod Inc, Los Angeles, CA) to estimate insulin sensitivity
[insulin sensitivity index (Si)]. The incremental ﬁrst-phase insulin
secretion [acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg)] was mea-
sured by calculating the area under the insulin curve above the
baseline for the ﬁrst 10 min after an intravenous glucose infusion.
The disposition index is calculated as AIRg · Si. Other outcomes
included the change from baseline to 16 wk in AIRg, Si, and
glucose tolerance (Hb A1c, FPG and 2hPG).
Assessment of potential confounders
Height (to 60.1 cm) was measured at baseline with a wall-
mounted stadiometer, and body weight (to 6100 g) was mea-
sured at every visit with an electronic calibrated scale (Cardinal
Detecto Model 758C; Cardinal Health, Webb City, MO). BMI
was calculated as weight divided by the square of height (in kg/m2).
Data on age, sex, race, ethnicity, and family history of diabetes
were self-reported at baseline.
Laboratory analysis
Blood measurements were done in the morning after a 12-h
overnight fast. Plasma glucose was measured by an oxygen
rate method with a Beckman Synchron LX System (Beckman
Coulter Inc, Fullerton, CA). Hb A1c was measured with a Tosoh
G7 high-performance liquid chromatochraphy assay (Tosoh
Bioscience Inc, San Francisco, CA), certiﬁed through the national
glycohemoglobin standardization program (http://www.ngsp.
org). Serum insulin was measured with a radioimmunoassay
commercial kit (DPC Coat-A-Count Insulin assay; Siemens
Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angeles, CA). Plasma 25
(OH)D was measured at Tufts Medical Center by using liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry certiﬁed through the Na-
tional Institute of Standards and Technology vitamin D quality
assurance program (14). Laboratory measurements were done in

a masked fashion and in pairs (before and after the intervention)
in the same analytic run to reduce systematic error and interassay
variability, with the exception of Hb A1c, which was completed
after each sample was collected.
Statistical analysis
To reduce the measurement error, the baseline value for all
physical and biochemical (glucose and insulin) measurements
were calculated as the mean of values obtained at the screening
(visit 1) and randomization (visit 2) visits. Similarly, the end-of-
study measurements were calculated as the mean of values
obtained at the OGTT (visit 4) and FSIVGTT (visit 5) visits at
16-wk. To examine differences in baseline characteristics be-
tween groups, we used the analysis of variance test for differences
in means for continuous data and the chi-square test for
differences in proportions for categorical variables. For each
comparison, we veriﬁed whether assumptions for the statistical
analyses were met. To compare differences between treatment
groups in outcomes over time, we used general linear models
(PROC GLM procedure, SAS Software version 9.2; SAS, Cary,
NC) conditioned on baseline values to avoid the potential bias
that might have resulted if the magnitude of the change depended
on the starting value and adjusted for the stratiﬁed variables (age
and BMI) during randomization. We also adjusted for race (white
compared with nonwhite) as a proxy for the different vitamin D
homeostasis in persons with dark skin (15) and time at study entry
(as the season of the year in 4 categories: January to March
compared with April to June compared with July to September
compared with October to December). We did not adjust for
multiple comparisons because hypotheses were prespeciﬁed a
priori (16).
The intention-to-treat analyses for the primary outcome (the
change in the disposition index) and Si included 88 participants.
Four participants were excluded because the FSIVGTT was not
done at baseline (n = 1) or because of an inability to calculate
the disposition index and Si because of the early stoppage of the
test because of symptomatic hypoglycemia (n = 3; Figure 1).
These 4 participants contributed data to the secondary outcomes
AIRg, Hb A1c, FPG, and 2hPG. Consistent with the intention-to-
treat principle, data from participants who were lost to follow-up
(n = 4) were included in the analyses with their baseline values
carried forward. We tested for the interaction between treatment
group assignments (vitamin D, calcium) for the primary and
secondary outcomes by including the interaction term vitamin
D · calcium, in the regression model. P values were 2-sided at
the 0.05 signiﬁcance level. Statistical analysis was done with
SAS version 9.2.
FIGURE 1. Flow of participants. Data on the primary outcome (the disposition index) were not available for 4 participants either because the frequently
sampled intravenous-glucose-tolerance test was not done at baseline and follow-up (n = 1) or the test was stopped prematurely because of symptomatic
hypoglycemia and the disposition index could not be estimated (n = 3). These 4 participants were excluded from the analysis of the primary outcome (the
disposition index) and insulin sensitivity index, but they all contributed data to secondary outcomes (insulin secretion and measures of glycemia). Data from
participants who withdrew or who were lost to follow-up were included in the analysis by carrying over their baseline values.

RESULTS
Participant characteristics and follow-up
Between October 2007 and July 2009, 247 participants were
screened for eligibility, of whom 92 participants (37%) un-
derwent randomization (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics of
participants are shown in Table 1. Consistent with a prediabetes
(glucose-intolerant) population, the mean (6SEM) age of the
cohort was 57 6 1 y, BMI was 32 6 0, and Hb A1c was 5.9 6
0.0%. According to the 2010 American Diabetes Association
diagnostic criteria for diabetes that includes Hb A1c as a crite-
rion (17), 93% of participants were at risk of diabetes, and 7% of
participants had diabetes. The mean (6 SEM) plasma 25(OH)D
concentration at baseline was 24.5 6 0.8 ng/mL. There was some
heterogeneity in baseline values of the disposition index, AIRg,
and Si in the 4 groups; however, values were nonstatistically

signiﬁcant. Four participants did not return for their follow-up
visits at 16 wk (Figure 1), but they were included in the intention-
to-treat analyses.
Intervention
Supplements were well tolerated. Only 1 participant discontinued
all study pills because of an intolerance to the smell of the calcium
pills. Pill adherence (consumption of .80% of prescribed pills) was
89% to vitamin D pills and 85% to calcium pills without any
differences between groups. At the last follow-up visit, the plasma
25(OH)D concentration was higher in the vitamin D group than in
the no vitamin D group (30.6 6 1.2 compared with 18.4 6 1.1 ng/
mL respectively; P for difference , 0.001; Table 2) whereas the 25
(OH)D concentration did not differ between the calcium and no
calcium groups (Table 2).
Change in disposition index, insulin sensitivity, and insulin
secretion
After adjustment for stratiﬁed variables (age and BMI), the
baseline disposition index value, race, and time of study entry, the
disposition index signiﬁcantly increased in the vitamin D group
and decreased in the no vitamin D group (adjusted mean change 6
SEM: 300 6 130 for vitamin D compared with 2126 6 127 for
no vitamin D; P = 0.011; Figure 2A). There was no signiﬁcant
difference in the change in the disposition index with calcium
compared with no calcium (79 6 130 for calcium compared with
83 6 135 for no calcium; P = 0.979; Figure 2A). Within each
individual group, combined vitamin D and calcium supplemen-
tation or vitamin D alone, compared with placebo, improved
the disposition index the most, and the difference was nearly
signiﬁcant compared with placebos (Figure 2B). There was no
signiﬁcant interaction between the 2 interventions (vitamin D ·

calcium) on the change in the disposition index (P for inter-
action = 0.92).
The change in AIRg paralleled the change in the disposition
index. Insulin secretion signiﬁcantly increased in the vitamin D
group and decreased in the no vitamin D group (62 6 39 for
vitamin D compared with 236 6 37 mU · L21 · min for no vi-
tamin D; P = 0.046), whereas there was no signiﬁcant difference
with calcium compared with no calcium (Table 2). Insulin secre-
tion increased the most in the group that received both vitamin D
and calcium (76 6 51 for vitamin D and calcium compared with
244 6 50 mU · L21 · min for placebo; P = 0.082; Table 3). There
was no signiﬁcant change in insulin sensitivity in any group
(Tables 2 and 3). There was no interaction between the 2 in-
terventions (vitamin D · calcium) on the change in insulin se-
cretion (P for interaction = 0.87) or insulin sensitivity (P for
interaction = 0.43).
Change in glycemia
As expected, because of the natural history of prediabetes, Hb
A1c increased in all groups during the study period. Hb A1c
tended to increase less in the vitamin D group than in the no
vitamin D group, but the result was not signiﬁcant (0.06 6
0.03% for vitamin D compared with 0.14 6 0.03% for no vi-
tamin D; P = 0.081; Table 2); however, after excluding 2 outliers
with a change in Hb A1c .0.8%, the difference between vitamin
D compared with no vitamin D became signiﬁcant (0.08 6
0.03% compared with 0.15 6 0.02%, respectively; P = 0.024).
There was no difference in the Hb A1c change with calcium than
with no calcium (Table 2). Within each individual group, the
combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation, compared
with the placebo, attenuated the increase in Hb A1c the most
(0.05 6 0.05% for vitamin D and calcium compared with
0.18 6 0.04% for the placebo; P = 0.036; Table 3). However,
there was no signiﬁcant interaction between the 2 interventions
(vitamin D · calcium) on the change in Hb A1c (P for in-
teraction = 0.51).
There was no signiﬁcant effect of vitamin D compared with no
vitamin D or calcium compared with no calcium on FPG or 2hPG
(Table 2). Vitamin D alone attenuated the increase in FPG the
most compared with the placebo (2.1 6 2.5 for vitamin D alone
compared with 8.4 6 2.3 for the placebo; P = 0.051; Table 3).
There was no interaction between the 2 interventions (vitamin
D · calcium) on FPG (P for interaction = 0.15) or 2hPG (P for
interaction = 0.82).
Safety
A total of 28 adverse events were reported without difference
between study groups. There were no reports of nephrolithiasis or
hypercalcemia. Two participants (one patient randomly assigned
to receive vitamin D and calcium and the other patient randomly
assigned to receive calcium alone) were brieﬂy hospitalized for
reasons unrelated to the study but returned for follow-up visits.
One participant randomly assigned to the vitamin D alone group
sustained an ankle fracture and withdrew from the study. Three
participants permanently discontinued all study pills during the
trial (one participant did not tolerate the taste of the calcium pills
and 2 participants discontinued all study pills on the advice of
their physicians), but they returned for follow-up visits.
DISCUSSION
In this 2-by-2 factorial trial of vitamin D and calcium sup-
plementation in adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes, vitamin D
supplementation with or without calcium improved the dispo-
sition index and insulin secretion, and there was a trend toward an
attenuation of the rise in Hb A1c that occurs over time in this
population. The supplementation with calcium alone did not
have any signiﬁcant effect, and there was no signiﬁcant in-
teraction between the 2 nutrients on primary or secondary out-
comes. These results suggested that vitamin D may have a role
in delaying the progression to clinical diabetes in adults at high
risk of type 2 diabetes. Our results may also be relevant to
patients with type 1 diabetes, which is characterized by b cell

failure; however, a speciﬁc study in type 1 diabetes would be
needed to test this hypothesis because the underlying defect (au-
toimmunity) is different from type 2 diabetes.
For type 2 diabetes to develop, impaired pancreatic b cell function
and insulin resistance are often present, and there is evidence from
nonhuman studies that vitamin D inﬂuences both of these mecha-
nisms. In in vitro and in vivo studies, vitamin D deﬁciency impaired
the glucose-mediated insulin secretion from b cells (2, 18–20),
whereas vitamin D supplementation restored the insulin secretion
(2, 19–22). Vitamin D may have a direct effect mediated by the
binding of the active form 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D to the vitamin
D receptor, which is expressed in b cells (23, 24). The presence of
the vitamin D response element in the human insulin gene promoter
(25) and transcriptional activation of the human insulin gene caused
by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (26) further supported a direct effect
of vitamin D on insulin synthesis and secretion. Alternatively, the
activation of vitamin D may occur within the b cell by the 25(OH)
D-1a-hydroxylase (CYP27B1), which is expressed in b cells (27).
An indirect effect of vitamin D on the pancreatic b cell may be
mediated via its regulation of calcium that in turn, affects insulin
secretion, which is a calcium-dependent process (28). In peripheral
insulin-target cells, active vitamin D metabolites may enhance in-
sulin sensitivity in several ways, including the increase of the ex-
pression of insulin receptors (26), the activation of transcription
factors important in glucose homeostasis (29), or indirectly via the
regulation of calcium, which is essential for insulin-mediated in-
tracellular processes.
In the CaDDM study, vitamin D supplementation improved the
disposition index by ’26% compared with a worsening of
’14% in the group that received no vitamin D. The disposition
index is a measure of pancreatic b cell function that captures
the hyperbolic relation between insulin secretion and insulin

sensitivity (30). A low disposition index indicates an impaired
pancreatic b cell function and is a validated predictor of diabetes
risk (31, 32). Vitamin D improved the disposition index and in-
sulin secretion (AIRg), but its effect on insulin sensitivity was not
signiﬁcant, which indicated a predominant effect of vitamin D
on the pancreatic b cell. The targeting of b cell function early in
the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is considered a critical in-
tervention for the prevention of the disease (33), and our results
suggested that vitamin D supplementation may have a role in
delaying the natural history of type 2 diabetes.
Our results were consistent with observational studies in which
an association between vitamin D status and insulin secretion has
been reported (34, 35). Two other small trials have reported no
change in insulin secretion after vitamin D supplementation
among insulin resistant (36) or healthy obese adults (37). Several
observational studies have reported an association between vi-
tamin D status and insulin sensitivity (38–41), but in our study,
the effect of vitamin D supplementation on insulin sensitivity was
not signiﬁcant. A few other trials have reported no change in
insulin sensitivity after vitamin D supplementation in healthy
adults (37, 42, 43) or patients with established type 2 diabetes (44);
however, vitamin D supplementation improved insulin sensitivity
in persons with insulin resistance (37) or prediabetes (45).
Glycemia, as measured by Hb A1c, tends to rise as part of the
natural history of prediabetes (46). Although the absolute differ-
ence in Hb A1c between the vitamin D and no vitamin D groups
appeared to be small (’0.08%), such a difference could have
a large effect at the population level, especially in individuals with
prediabetes. For example, in the Diabetes Prevention Program
trial, which targeted a population very similar to our population,
the difference in Hb A1c between the active lifestyle intervention
and placebo throughout the entire duration of the study was
’0.15%, which was associated with a 58% decrease in incident
diabetes (46). In the CaDMM study, although not signiﬁcant, FPG
rose in both groups but less so in the vitamin D group, whereas
2hPG declined in the vitamin D group, which suggested that the
effect of vitamin D on glycemia may have been more pronounced
in the postprandial phase, consistent with the improvement in
AIRg. However, a larger study powered for glycemic outcomes
would be required to conﬁrm this hypothesis.
Several trials have reported the effect of vitamin D supple-
mentation on glycemia (5, 43, 44) or incident diabetes by self-
reports (42, 47). Seven trials included participants with normal
glucose tolerance, and 3 trials had participants with established
type 2 diabetes. In these trials, supplementation with vitamin D had
no signiﬁcant effect on glycemic measures or incident diabetes.
However, several of these studies were designed for nonglycemic
outcomes, and the analyses on vitamin D were post hoc, and all
trials but one trial (42) were underpowered for glycemic outcomes.
Moreover, several trials supplemented with infrequent (weekly or
monthly) large doses of vitamin D, which may not have been
a desirable physiologic method for supplementation and may have
been be counterproductive (48). However, vitamin D may have
beneﬁcial effects in individuals with prediabetes, as suggested
by the results of the present study and a post hoc analysis of a com-
pleted trial with combined vitamin D3 calcium carbonate in adults
with glucose intolerance at baseline (45).
In the CaDDM study, the calcium supplementation did not
have any signiﬁcant effect, and there was no interaction between
vitamin D and calcium on outcomes. Calcium intake has been
associated with lower risk of incident diabetes in previous studies
(9, 10), and the combination of vitamin D and calcium may have
been more beneﬁcial than with either nutrient alone (10, 45).
However, in these studies the intake of calcium that conferred
a beneﬁt was between 600 and 1000 mg calcium per day. In our
study, the mean dietary calcium intake at baseline was 859 mg
calcium per day, which indicated that most participants may have
already reached the necessary threshold for calcium intake re-
quired for a beneﬁt, and additional intake during the trial would
not have conferred an increased beneﬁt (49).
The strengths of our study included the study design, pop-
ulation with prediabetes, high retention rate, high adherence to
the study interventions, the mean 25(OH)D concentration ach-
ieved in the vitamin D group (’31 ng/mL) despite the population
being obese, difference between vitamin compared with no vi-
tamin D groups (’12 ng/mL), and the use of a highly sensitive
and validated measure of b cell function. Potential limitations
were that participants were predominantly white, there was
some heterogeneity in baseline values of the disposition index,
AIRg and Si in the 4 groups (although not signiﬁcant), and the
short duration of the study; however, our analyses adjusted for
race to account for skin color, for baseline values of outcomes,
and for the time at study entry to account for seasonal differ-
ences in sun exposure because of 4-mo study period. We did not
adjust for multiple comparisons because the hypotheses were
speciﬁed a priori, which may have increased the possibility of an
experiment-wise (type 1) error. Finally, because our study was
conducted at a single-site, the results may not apply in geo-
graphic areas at different latitudes.
In conclusion, supplementation with vitamin D was associated
with improved pancreatic b cell function in adults at high risk of
type 2 diabetes, and there was a trend toward attenuating the rise
in Hb A1c that occurs over time in this population. Because our
study was short-term and was not powered for hard clinical
outcomes, our ﬁndings need to be conﬁrmed in larger trials of
longer duration to test the hypothesis that vitamin D supple-
mentation is a safe and effective intervention to improve gly-
cemia and retard the progression from prediabetes to diabetes in
participants at high risk of the disease.
