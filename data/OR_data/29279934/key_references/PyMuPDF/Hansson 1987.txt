Summary. Daily treatment with 30 mg of sodium 
fluoride (NaF) and 1 g of calcium over a 3-year pe- 
riod increased the bone mineral content (BMC) in 
the spines of women (n = 25) with osteoporosis. 
Determination of the BMC was followed with dual 
photon absorptiometry (137Cs-241Am) in the third 
lumbar vertebra. No increase in BMC was found 
with only 10 mg sodium fluoride in combination 
with calcium (n = 25), with calcium alone (n = 25), 
or with placebo (n = 25). No serious side effects 
were registered. There was, however, minor gastro- 
intestinal distress in one-fifth of the patients taking 
30 mg NaF daily. 
Key words: Absorptiometry -- Calcium -- Osteo- 
porosis -- Fluoride -- Fracture. 
Fluoride has been given to humans based on the 
hypothesis that it stimulates formation of new bone 
which is normally mineralized if sufficient calcium 
is provided. Most (60-70%) osteoporotic women 
respond to fluoride without side effects and studies 
have shown an increase of bone mass (up to 
30-50% in 1 year) and a tenfold decrease of frac- 
tures [1-9]. However, these studies have used high 
doses of NaF (50-80 mg/day), which induce signifi- 
cant side effects, and have not included control 
groups. Since we, in an earlier trial, found the same 
effect on the BMC of the spine after medication 
with 50 mg NaF as with 30 mg NaF daily, this study

examined the effect of lower doses of fluoride in 
women with idiopathic osteoporosis [5]. 
Materials and Methods 
Women (n = 100) selected for this study had at least one and a 
maximum of three vertebral compression fractures within the 
thoracic or lumbar spines, sustained during minor traumas. 
Since L3 was the vertebral level used for determination of the 
spinal bone mineral, a fracture at this level excluded from the 
study. All the women were postmenopausal, and none had 
known diseases or was taking a medication that could directly 
influence the normal skeletal metabolism. 
The mean age of the women was 66 (SD 6) years. They were 
randomly placed into four different treatment groups (A, B, C, 
and D), each made up of 25 women. The mean age of the women 
in each group and treatment given is presented in Table 1. 
Fluoride was given as sodium fluoride. It was administered in 
capsules containing 30 (Group A) or 10 mg each (Group B). Cal- 
cium was given to both of these groups, and to another that did 
not receive fluoride (Group C), as a combination of bicarbonate, 
lactate, and gluconate, 1 g/day. The patients in group D got one 
daily capsule containing placebo (starch). The patients receiving 
fluoride took it in the morning and the calcium in the evening. 
Roentgenograms of the lumbar and thoracic spines were taken 
within 1 month after the treatment started and again after three 
years of treatment. The changes in the BMC of the third lumbar 
vertebra (L3) were followed with dual photon absorptiometry 
[12, 13]. BMC was determined at the start of the treatment, at 1 
year, 11/2 years, 2 years, and 3 years of treatment. Our dual 
photon absorptiometer uses two radionuclides with different 
gamma energies (241Americium and 137Cesium) arranged so there 
is a common collimated radiation beam. The transmitted radia- 
tion of both energies is measured with a scintillation detector 
and nuclear counting instrumentation. The radiation beam is 
centered over the L3 using an X-ray tube and an image intensi- 
fier. Transmission measurements are then performed as a scan- 
ning procedure over the vertebra in 4 mm steps. By plotting the 
attenuated energies at each step, a bone profile curve is obtained 
from which the BMC is calculated. The stability of the absorpti- 
ometer, which is of crucial importance for a high reproducibility 
especially in a study extended over several years, has been

tested by 57 measurements of the same Al-phantom over a pe- 
riod of 5 years. The 57 measurements gave a regression line with 
a slope that differed 0.15% from a straight line [10]. The accu- 
racy of our method has been determined in numerous vertebrae 
before and after they have been ashed. The accuracy has also 
been determined by measurements first of vertebrae in situ in 
the body and then after they have been excised from the body. In 
these experiments the errors in accuracy and reproducibility 
have been found to be less than 3% [10-12]. A more detailed 
description of the theory and the measuring technique has been 
given earlier [11, 12].

Results 
The BMC changes in the four different groups are 
presented in Table 1. 
The number of patients who completed the 3- 
year study were 24 in Group A, 23 in Group B, 22 
in Group C, and 19 in Group D. There were no sta- 
tistically significant changes in the BMC in groups 
B, C, or D. Group A increased significantly (P < 
0.01). The absolute increase in BMC in Group A 
was 0.46 g/cm, which corresponded to a 17% in- 
crease over the 3 years of treatment. 
The increase of BMC in Group A was statisti- 
cally significant after 11/2 years of treatment, with a 
majority of the women showing an increase. After 3 
years, 19/25 showed an increase, 5/25 showed a de- 
crease. The biggest individual increase over 3 years 
was 27.1%, while the biggest individual decrease 
was 4.2%. The mean increase among the re- 
sponders in Group A was 18.5%. The corre- 
sponding decrease among the nonresponders in the 
same group was 2.2%. The individual changes in 
Group A are shown graphically in Figure 1. Five of 
the patients in Group A had adverse reactions prob- 
ably caused by the treatment. Four had mild gastro- 
intestinal symptoms (nausea and gastritis). One pa- 
tient developed a peptic ulcer which forced her to 
abandon the treatment after 10 months. Two of the 
women with adverse reactions belonged to the 
nonresponders. Four certainly new vertebral com- 
pression fractures were noticed in the entire group

of women; two occurred in Group B and one in 
Groups C and D respectively. 
Discussion 
This controlled, prospective study indicated that 30 
mg of sodium fluoride and 1 g calcium taken daily 
significantly increased the BMC in the lumbar 
spine. The average value after 3 years of treatment 
among the women in group A was in the lower por- 
tion of the normal range for age-matched normals. 
This increase was not found when only 10 mg so- 
dium fluoride or only calcium was given daily. 
Pending that the increase of BMC reflected an ap- 
position of bone with normal qualities, the increase 
of BMC in those 76% who did respond in Group A 
probably could be of a sufficient magnitude (18.5%) 
to lower the risk of new fractures due to minor 
traumas. In another study [14] we found that a 
BMC deficit of about 15-20% was associated with

an apparent risk of the first vertebral fracture in 
women of this age; fluoride treatment over only 3 
years put a majority of the responding subjects 
above this threshold. 
A lower incidence of compression fractures after 
fluoride/calcium treatment has been reported from 
studies in osteoporotic patients [2, 4, 10]. As in 
these earlier studies, however, not all individuals 
respond to fluoride treatment and there are some 
mildly adverse side effects even at low doses. The 
lack of response may reflect lack of bone cell ac- 
tivity, an absence of precursor bone cells, or a 
simple failure to elevate blood fluoride levels (pos- 
sibly associated with noncompliance in those with 
side effects). Some studies [2, 3] have failed to 
show positive responses to fluoride on the predomi- 
nantly compact bone (75%-95%) of the distal 
radius (even in patients who responded vigorously 
in iliac crest biopsy [2]), but this discrepancy from 
our results could be explained, for example, by a 
difference in effectiveness of this agent on trabec- 
ular bone of the axial skeleton. As with previous 
studies on compact bone, however, no effect of cal- 
cium supplementation was evident in the spine. 
Given the normal calcium intake of Swedish pa- 
tients (about 800 mg/day), it is not clear if the cal- 
cium provided with the fluoride therapy is neces- 
sary in this population, thought it may be of value 
in the populations where a lower dietary intake 
provides insufficient mineralization resources for 
the fluoride-induced bone.
