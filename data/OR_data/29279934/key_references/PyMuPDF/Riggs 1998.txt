ABSTRACT
We report a 4-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 236 normal postmenopausal
women (mean age 6 SE, 66.3 6 0.2 years) who were randomized to a calcium (1600 mg/day as the citrate) or
placebo group. The women were seen every 6 months; 177 completed the trial. Net percentage changes in each
group are given relative to baseline. The differences in net percentage changes (calcium group minus placebo
group) in medians were: for lumbar spine bone density, 2.0% ( p < 0.001) at year 1 and 0.3% (not significant) at
year 4; for proximal femur bone density, 1.3% ( p 5 0.003) at year 1 and 1.3% ( p 5 0.015) at year 4; and for total
body bone mineral, 0.4% ( p 5 0.002) at year 1 and 0.9% ( p 5 0.017) at year 4. Similar differences at year 4 were:
218.9% ( p 5 0.002) for parathyroid hormone (PTH), 211.9% ( p 5 0.026) for serum osteocalcin, and 232.2%
( p 5 0.003) for urine free pyridinoline. We conclude that long-term administration of calcium supplements to
elderly women partially reverses age-related increases in serum PTH level and bone resorption and decreases bone
loss. However, the effects on bone loss were weaker than those reported for estrogen, bisphosphonates, or
calcitonin therapy, indicating that calcium supplements alone cannot substitute for these in treating established
osteoporosis. Nonetheless, because of their safety, high tolerance, and low expense, calcium supplements may be
a useful preventive measure for elderly postmenopausal women whose bone mineral density values are normal for
their age. (J Bone Miner Res 1998;13:168–174)
INTRODUCTION
O
STEOPOROSIS CAUSES MORE THAN A MILLION fractures each
year in the United States, requiring care at an esti-
mated annual cost of $13.8 billion.(1) Given the magnitude
of this problem, public health measures are important and
calcium supplements are an attractive option for preventive
intervention. With aging and the postmenopausal state, the
dietary calcium requirement increases because calcium ab-
sorption is impaired(2–4) and renal calcium conservation is
decreased.(5,6) Although a National Institutes of Health
(NIH) Consensus Development Panel(7) has recommended
a calcium intake of 1500 mg/day, a recent national survey(8)
found that elderly women consume less than 700 mg/day,
which is even less than the RDA for calcium of 800 mg/day
established by the National Academy of Sciences.
Clinical studies of the effects of dietary calcium intake on
bone loss in postmenopausal women have given conflicting
results. During the first few years after menopause—the
rapid phase of bone loss—calcium supplements are inef-
fective in retarding cancellous bone loss from the central
skeleton and have only a modest effect in slowing loss of

cortical bone from the peripheral skeleton,(9–11) suggesting
that this phase of postmenopausal bone loss is mediated
primarily by estrogen deficiency. In older postmenopausal
women, calcium supplements generally have produced a
higher bone mineral density (BMD) in the treatment group
than in the placebo group only at 1 year, with no significant
difference thereafter.(12–17) This indicates that either the
initial beneficial effect cannot be maintained or that clinical
trials lasting only 2 or 3 years did not have sufficient statis-
tical power to detect a subsequent more modest slowing of
bone loss. Positive results, however, were reported by Reid
et al.(18) in a 2-year open-label extension of their 2-year trial
to 4 years and, more recently, by Recker et al.(19) in a 4-year
clinical trial.
Because more information is needed to define the role of
calcium supplementation in the prevention of osteoporosis,
we conducted a 4-year randomized, prospective, double-
blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 236 late postmeno-
pausal normal women to assess effects on rates of bone loss
from the total skeleton, vertebrae, and hip and on age-
related increases in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) and
biochemical markers of bone turnover. Because fracture
rates in Olmsted County, Minnesota, resemble those na-
tionally(20) and because the study subjects were normal
elderly women from a demographically characterized,(21)
age-stratified segment of the Olmsted County population
and were not selected on the basis of a low calcium intake,
the results are relevant to the general population of Amer-
ican white women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Experimental subjects
All of the 236 women residents of Olmsted County en-
rolled in this study were fully ambulatory between 61 and 70
years of age, and postmenopausal for 10 years or more.
None had a history of osteoporotic fracture or evidence of
vertebral fracture by clinical assessment of roentgenograms
of the spinal column, as assessed qualitatively by a radiol-
ogist, and all had normal values (Z score above 22.0) on
bone densitometry of the vertebrae and proximal femur, as
adjusted for age and gender. We excluded subjects with a
history of renal lithiasis, impaired renal function, hypercal-
cemia, or hypercalciuria (.300 mg/24 h). As assessed by
review of their complete (inpatient and outpatient) medical
records and by interview and testing, none of the enrolled
women had any disease known to affect bone or calcium
metabolism. All had normal values for serum and urinary
calcium and serum creatinine. None was receiving estrogen,
large doses of vitamin D or calcium, or other drugs known
to affect bone, and none had a history of use of fluoride or
bisphosphonate drugs. However, women taking supplemen-
tary calcium at #500 mg/day and/or vitamin D at #800
U/day at baseline were eligible for inclusion in the trial.
Subjects first were screened for entry criteria by exami-
nation of their medical records at Mayo. For this, we ex-
amined 3013 medical records which constituted essentially
all women residents of Olmsted County who were between
61 and 70 years of age(21); 1993 women were not eligible on
the basis of the exclusion criteria. Of those remaining, 500
responded positively to a letter requesting an interview, 306
agreed to participate in the clinical trial, and 236 were
found to be eligible and were accepted into the trial. All of
the women gave written informed consent, and the trial was
reviewed and approved by the Mayo Institutional Review
Board.
Experimental design
The clinical trial was randomized, controlled, prospec-
tive, and double-blind and was conducted under intent-to-
treat conditions. Thus, data from all women randomized
into the trial were used in data analysis. The women were
assigned randomly to the treatment (119 women) or to the
control (117 women) group. The subjects were prescribed
calcium tablets or matching placebo tablets four times dai-
ly—with each meal and at bedtime. The calcium was given
as the citrate salt for a total dose of elemental calcium of
1600 mg/day. During the 4 years that the women were
treated, each was seen every 6 months. Annually, a blood
sample was drawn in the early morning while the subject
was fasting, and a 24-h urine collection was turned in at
each visit. At baseline and again at the end of the study,
roentgenograms of the thoracic and lumbar spinal columns
were obtained and an assessment of calcium intake was
made by a dietitian from a 7-day food record. Bone densi-
tometry was performed at 6-month intervals. When a serum
calcium value .10.4 mg/dl or a urinary calcium value .350
mg/24 h was found, the dosage of calcium (or placebo) was
decreased according to a predetermined algorithm. To
maintain blinded conditions for the investigators, an un-
blinded statistician selected a paired woman from the op-
posite group (placebo or treatment) for whom the dosage
was decreased by a comparable number of tablets. The
study medications were dispensed by a research pharmacist,
and compliance was monitored by pill counting at each visit.
Laboratory studies
All serum samples were obtained in the early morning
while the subject was fasting. The serum and urine samples
were stored at 270°C until they were analyzed periodically
in batches. Biomedical variables were measured annually
except for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which
was measured only at baseline, and urinary free pyridino-
line, which was measured at baseline and at 1 and 4 years.
Serum levels of phosphate, creatinine (Cr), and alkaline
phosphatase and urinary levels of Cr were measured by
routine methods with an AutoAnalyzer. Serum osteocal-
cin(22) and bone alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme(23) levels
were measured by radioimmunoassays. Free pyridinoline
cross-links in a 24-h urine collection were measured with an
enzyme immunoassay kit (Pyrilinks, Metra BioSystems,
Mountain Home, CA, U.S.A.). Serum intact PTH was mea-
sured by a two-site immunochemiluminometric assay.(24)
Serum 25(OH)D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were mea-
sured by the methods of Eisman et al.(25) and Kumar et
al.,(26) respectively. BMD of the lumbar spine (LS-BMD)
and proximal femur (PF-BMD) and total body bone min-

eral (TBBM) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorp-
tiometry with a Hologic QDR 2000 scanner (Hologic Inc.,
Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Vertebral fractures were assessed
as described(27) with an eight-point digitization method for
the T4 to L5 vertebrae on the lateral roentgenogram. A
change of more than 15% from baseline in the anterior,
middle, or posterior height of a vertebra was considered to
indicate a new fracture.
Statistical analysis
For each subject, all follow-up measurements were re-
lated to her corresponding baseline value by expressing any
change as a percent of baseline. At each time of observa-
tion, the calcium group was compared with the control
group using the Wilcoxon rank sum test, since the percent
changes did not appear to have a Gaussian distribution. For
these time-specific analyses, all subjects providing data at
that follow-up time are used in an analysis of data. The

RESULTS
Clinical findings
The major clinical and biochemical characteristics of the
subjects at baseline are shown in Table 1. There were no
between-group differences in these or in any other covari-
ates, which indicates that the randomization was successful.
Of the 236 women enrolled, 177 completed all 4 years of the
trial (88 in the calcium and 89 in the placebo group).
Thirty-three discontinued treatment for personal reasons or
intercurrent illnesses, and 16 discontinued because of side
effects (10 in the calcium and 6 in the placebo group).
Other reasons for dropping out included BMD below the
normal range in two subjects, osteoporotic fractures in five,
death in a motor vehicle accident in one, lost to follow-up in
one, and taking calcium prescribed by local personal phy-
sician in one. The side effects included excessive abdominal
cramping, constipation, bloating, or diarrhea (nine in the
calcium group; two in the placebo group), arthralgia and
depression (one, placebo), renal stone (one, placebo), and
hypercalciuria (one, calcium; two, placebo).
In one subject in the calcium group, mild hypercalcemia
developed; 44 women in the calcium group and 7 in the
placebo group had a urinary calcium exceeding 350 mg/24 h
during the study, necessitating a reduction in dosage (cal-
cium or placebo). One patient in the placebo group had
hematuria and was found to have a kidney stone. There
were no significant differences between groups in the num-
bers of new vertebral fractures as determined by a fracture
algorithm (8 for the calcium group and 9 for the placebo
group) or of new nonvertebral fractures (11 for the calcium
group and 12 for the placebo group) or total new fractures.
As assessed by tablet counts, the mean dose of calcium in
the treatment group was 1234 mg/day. There was no signif-
icant change in dietary calcium intake in either group over
the course of the study.
Laboratory findings
Median BMD values at the three scanning sites in both
the calcium treatment and placebo group at baseline and
median changes from BMD at 1 and 4 years are given in
Table 2. The differences (calcium group minus placebo
group) of the net change (follow-up as percent of baseline)
in BMD values over time are shown in Fig. 1. For net BMD,
the difference in median LS-BMD values was 2.0% ( p ,
0.001) by 1 year which then gradually decreased to 0.3%

BMD values was 1.3% ( p 5 0.003) by 1 year and remained
at 1.3% ( p 5 0.015) at 4 years; the difference in median
TBBM values was 0.4% ( p 5 0.002) by 1 year and then
increased to 0.9% ( p 5 0.017) by 4 years.
Values for the change in serum and urine variables are
given in Table 3. Differences (calcium group vs. the placebo
group) in median values were 218.9% ( p 5 0.002) for
serum PTH, 211.9% ( p 5 0.026) for osteocalcin, a marker
for bone formation, and 232.2% ( p 5 0.003) for free
pyridinoline, a marker for bone resorption.
For both BMD and biochemical measurements, when the
significance of changes in the treatment versus the placebo
group is analyzed using data for women completing the full
4 years of the trial, the results are similar to those obtained
using intent-to-treat conditions.
DISCUSSION
Our data show that daily administration of 1600 mg of
calcium to elderly women for 4 years decreases the age-
related increases in serum PTH and bone resorption and
decreases the rate of bone loss. We found that the calcium
supplements were safe and well-tolerated. The only side
effect of the calcium preparation was the occurrence of
minor gastrointestinal symptoms in a small number of sub-
jects. However, to maintain values for urinary calcium at
,350 mg/day, it was necessary to decrease the dose of
calcium citrate in about one-third of the subjects in the
calcium treatment group. Because patients with achlorohy-
dria hyperabsorb calcium as citrate in the fasting state and
about 10% of elderly women are achlorohydric,(28) this
might explain the hypercalciuria that developed during
treatment in some subjects. Also, mild hypercalcemia oc-
curred in one subject in the calcium group; none of the
subjects in the calcium group experienced nephrolithiasis,
nephrocalcinosis, or a decrease in glomerular filtration rate.
Although the retardation in the rate of bone loss was
relatively small, this effect was more substantial than that
found in most of the previously reported trials that were
conducted for only 2 or 3 years. The longer duration of our
study is probably responsible for our greater statistical
power. Our results were not greatly different from those of
Reid et al.(18) who followed a 2-year study with an open-
label extension for 2 more years in most of the original
study patients. However, our results were less favorable
than those of Recker et al.(19) who recently reported results
of a 4-year clinical trial of the effects of calcium at 1200
mg/day compared with placebo in 197 elderly women. They
found that the change in forearm BMD was 21.2% in the
placebo group and 10.3% in the calcium group but did not
measure changes in BMD at other sites.
There were important differences between our study and
that by Recker et al. that may have contributed to their
more-favorable results. First, their subjects were almost a
decade older than ours. Next, they selected their subjects on

the basis of a low calcium intake, whereas we did not. The
average habitual dietary intake of calcium of their study
subjects was about 450 mg/day while that of subjects in our
study was about 700 mg/day. Dawson-Hughes et al.(11) dem-
onstrated that a calcium supplement of 500 mg/day signif-
icantly retarded bone loss in elderly postmenopausal
women with a calcium intake of less than 400 mg/day but
not in those with an intake of 400–650 mg/day. Taken
together, these three clinical trials indicate that the lower
the habitual calcium intake, the greater the benefit of cal-
cium supplements. Finally, almost half of the subjects in the
Recker et al. study had prevalent vertebral fractures at
baseline screening, whereas we excluded subjects who had
either vertebral fractures or low BMD. They also found that
calcium supplementation decreased the occurrence of new
fractures in the subgroup with prevalent vertebral fractures
at baseline but not in the subgroup without them. Because
a history of previous vertebral fractures is a strong risk
factor for the occurrence of new fractures, our inability to
detect an antifracture effect of calcium treatment relates to
inadequate statistical power to detect a change in fracture
rates in this lower risk population.
The relatively modest statistical significance of changes in
bone density between the calcium and placebo groups also
points out the difficulty of detecting even a halving of the
rate of bone loss by densitometry when the rate of bone loss
in the placebo group is expected to be only about 1%/
year.(29) This contrasts with the effects of more potent
antiresorptive drugs, such as estrogen,(30) calcitonin,(31) and
alendronate,(32) which cause a moderate increase in bone
density during the initial 2 or 3 years of therapy. This also
may explain the difficulty of most of the previous studies in
demonstrating a significant effect of calcium supplementa-
tion in retarding bone loss, particularly in those studies with
a smaller sample size and in those in which the duration of
treatment was less than 4 years. In addition, although no
abnormalities were detected in the quality-control measure-
ments, the increase in BMD in the placebo group may
indicate an upward drift in densitometer readings from
baseline values. However, because of the randomization
format, it was possible to detect the beneficial effect of
calcium supplementation by comparing the treatment
group with the placebo group.
The most consistent finding in previous clinical trials of
calcium supplementation was an early transient increase in
BMD in the lumbar spine, and we found this effect in the
present study as well. The explanation for this is not clear,
although it is possible that it may represent an enrichment
of calcium-deficient apatite as has been reported by Burnell
et al.(33) If so, it would explain why this increase occurred
predominantly in the cancellous bone of the vertebrae
which has a greater surface-to-volume ratio. However, in
our study, the effect on retarding bone loss at the proximal
femur, a site containing a mixture of cortical and cancellous
bone, continued over the 4 years of the study. Moreover,
the inhibition of bone loss over 4 years found in the clinical
trial by Recker et al.(19) occurred at the distal forearm, a
site that is almost entirely cortical bone. Thus, the pro-
tracted effect of calcium supplementation over several years
appears to be best detected at sites containing mostly cor-
tical bone.
Although we had marginal statistical power for detecting
the small decreases in bone loss induced by calcium sup-
plements, we had sufficient power to detect decreases in
serum PTH of 5% and urinary free pyridinoline, a marker
for bone resorption, of 10%. In fact, decreases associated
with calcium supplementation far exceeded these amounts.
The high baseline values for serum PTH and urinary pyri-
dinium cross-links in the elderly women in our study were
comparable to findings in a large population-based, age-
stratified sample of women residing in Olmsted County,
Minnesota,(34) a population that is generally representative
of the population of white women of the United States.(21)
We have previously published(35) an interim study of

circadian changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover
in a sample of 28 women from this clinical trial who had
received either placebo or calcium supplements for 3 years.
In these subjects, the double-blind format was maintained
by having the patients selected by an unblinded statistician.
In this sample, values for serum PTH and biochemical
markers for bone turnover were similar to those found in
the completed clinical trial, except that the magnitude of
the changes induced by the calcium supplements were even
greater than for the entire trial. These better results are
probably attributable to several differences between the two
studies. These include the selection of subjects in the sub-
study from those in the clinical trial who had the highest
and lowest calcium intake (diet plus calcium or placebo) at
baseline, more accurate assessment of parathyroid gland
function by using 24-h integrated values for serum PTH
based on sampling every 2 h in a metabolic ward rather than
by using only a single early morning serum sample, and
measurement of total pyridinium cross-links by high-pres-
sure liquid chromatography. Because the secondary hyper-
parathyroidism and increased bone resorption are major
determinants of age-related bone loss,(36) their reduction by
calcium supplementation is consistent with calcium defi-
ciency playing an important role in age-related bone loss.
The general view is that the rapid phase of bone loss in
the early postmenopause is due to loss of the direct action
of estrogen on bone cells and that this phase is poorly
responsive or nonresponsive to calcium supplementation.
The subsequent slower phase of bone loss has been thought
to be caused, at least in part, by age-related changes in
nonskeletal calcium homeostasis, including impaired cal-
cium absorption(3,4,37) and enhanced renal losses,(5,6) lead-
ing to increases in serum PTH and increases in bone re-
sorption. We recently found that long-standing estrogen
replacement will also return the secondary hyperparathy-
roidism to normal and decrease bone resorption.(32,38) This
suggests that estrogen deficiency may not only cause the
rapid postmenopausal phase of bone loss through a direct
effect on bone cell function but also may be permissive for
the subsequent slower phase of bone loss indirectly by
adversely affecting external calcium homeostasis. The find-
ings that estrogen replacement in postmenopausal women
increases calcium absorption(39,40) and enhances renal cal-
cium conservation(5,6) may explain why only estrogen can
decrease bone loss during the rapid, early postmenopausal
phase whereas either estrogen replacement or large doses
of calcium supplements can retard bone loss in the slower,
late postmenopausal phase.
Our data do not allow us to estimate the threshold of
dietary calcium intake that prevents a negative calcium
balance and bone loss in elderly postmenopausal women.
Because the women in our study with increased values for
serum PTH and bone resorption at baseline had a calcium
intake that was only slightly lower than the current RDA of
800 mg/day, it is obvious that this dietary intake level is too
low. Heaney et al.(41) used regression analysis of calcium
balance data to estimate that postmenopausal women
should have an intake of about 1500 mg/day to prevent
negative calcium balance. Prospective dose-ranging studies
assessing bone loss should now be made to establish the
optimal level of calcium intake for estrogen-deficient post-
menopausal women.
We have found that long-term calcium supplementation
decreases serum PTH, bone resorption, and bone loss in
elderly women. However, these effects were weaker than
those reported after treatment with estrogen, calcitonin, or
bisphosphonates, indicating that calcium cannot substitute
for them in treating established osteoporosis. Nonetheless,
because of their safety, high tolerance, and low expense,
calcium supplementation may be a useful preventive mea-
sure for elderly postmenopausal women whose BMD values
are normal for their age.
