IMPORTANCE Observational data link low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to both prevalent blood
pressure and incident hypertension. No clinical trial has yet examined the effect of vitamin D
supplementation in isolated systolic hypertension, the most common pattern of
hypertension in older people.
OBJECTIVE To test whether high-dose, intermittent cholecalciferol supplementation lowers
blood pressure in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.
DESIGN Parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial.
SETTING Primary care clinics and hospital clinics.
PARTICIPANTS Patients 70 years and older with isolated systolic hypertension (supine systolic
blood pressure >140 mm Hg and supine diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and baseline
25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL were randomized into the trial from June 1,
2009, through May 31, 2011.
INTERVENTIONS A total of 100 000 U of oral cholecalciferol or matching placebo every
3 months for 1 year.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Difference in office blood pressure, 24-hour blood
pressure, arterial stiffness, endothelial function, cholesterol level, insulin resistance, and
b-type natriuretic peptide level during 12 months.
RESULTS A total of 159 participants were randomized (mean age, 77 years). Mean baseline
office systolic blood pressure was 163/78 mm Hg. Mean baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D level
was 18 ng/mL. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D levels increased in the treatment group compared with
the placebo group (+8 ng/mL at 1 year, P < .001). No significant treatment effect was seen for
mean (95% CI) office blood pressure (−1 [−6 to 4]/−2 [−4 to 1] mm Hg at 3 months and 1 [−2 to
4]/0 [−2 to 2] mm Hg overall treatment effect). No significant treatment effect was evident
for any of the secondary outcomes (24-hour blood pressure, arterial stiffness, endothelial
function, cholesterol level, glucose level, and walking distance). There was no excess of
adverse events in the treatment group, and the total number of falls was nonsignificantly
lower in the group receiving vitamin D (36 vs 46, P = .24).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Vitamin D supplementation did not improve blood pressure
or markers of vascular health in older patients with isolated systolic hypertension.

I
solated systolic hypertension (ISH) is the most common
form of hypertension in older people,1-4 is associated with
an increased incidence of both cerebrovascular and car-
diovascular events, and is a driver of left ventricular hyper-
trophy—itself a risk factor for sudden cardiac death and heart
failure.5,6 Antihypertensive therapies improve cardiovascu-
lar outcomes in ISH,7-9 but few studies have enrolled typical
older patients with multimorbidity.3 The recent Hyperten-
sion in the Very Elderly trial10 confirms that the benefits of
blood pressure reduction extend to selected very old pa-
tients, but despite this evidence, many older patients are un-
dertreated in part because of the treatment constraints im-
posed by the presence of multimorbidity and polypharmacy
and in part because of the adverse effects inherent in many an-
tihypertensivemedications,includingdizzinessandfalls.New,
simple, safe, and inexpensive ways of treating blood pressure
in older people are highly desirable.
Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are strongly as-
sociatedwithbothprevalentandincidenthypertension11-13and
cardiovascular disease14,15 in observational studies, and meta-
analyses of previous intervention trials16 suggest that vita-
min D may reduce blood pressure in selected patient groups.
Trials to date have not evaluated the effects of vitamin D on
ISH. We conducted the VitDISH (Vitamin D in Isolated Sys-
tolic Hypertension) randomized controlled trial to test the
effect of intermittent, high-dose cholecalciferol on blood
pressure and markers of vascular function in older patients
with ISH.
Methods
Design and Participants
Research ethics approval was obtained from the Fife and Forth
ValleyNationalHealthServiceResearchEthicsCommittee(08/
S0501/90). Clinical trials authorization was obtained from the
UK Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Authority (Euro-
pean Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials No.
2008-004534-24). The trial sponsor was the University of
Dundee, and the trial was registered at www.controlled-trials
.com (ISRCTN92186858). The complete protocol is available
from the authors.
The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group trial. We studied community-
dwelling patients 70 years and older with ISH. Inclusion cri-
teria were as follows: age of 70 years or older, 25OHD level
less than 30 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multi-
ply by 2.496), and office systolic blood pressure greater than
140 mm Hg. Full exclusion criteria and detailed trial methods
are given in the eMethods in the Supplement. Patients were
recruited via 3 routes: from the community via primary care
practices, via an article in the local newspaper about the re-
searchstudy,andviasecondarycareclinics(cardiovascularand
medicine for the elderly).
Intervention
Participants enrolling in the study were allocated to inter-
vention or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Stratified randomization
was performed using a minimization algorithm, adminis-
tered by the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics (Glasgow
Clinical Trials Unit, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom)
using a telephone-based system to conceal study allocation
from investigators and participants. Minimization variables
used were baseline 25OHD level above or below 20 ng/mL,
baseline systolic blood pressure above or below 160 mm Hg,
baseline age older or younger than 80 years, and the pres-
ence of diabetes mellitus. Identical, masked medication
bottles were used; patients were observed ingesting 100 000
U of oral cholecalciferol (Vigantol oil; Merck KgAA) or
matching placebo (Mygliol oil; Merck KgAA) after comple-
tion of baseline and 3-, 6-, and 9-month assessments.
Primary Outcome Measures
All outcome measures were performed by researchers who
were masked to treatment allocation. Outcomes, including ve-
nepuncture for 25OHD levels, were all measured on the same
day, with trial medication dosing occurring the next day. The
primary outcome measure was prespecified as the between-
group difference in office blood pressure at 3 months ana-
lyzed using all participants regardless of whether they re-
ceived their allocated intervention.
Secondary Outcome Measures
24-Hour Blood Pressure
The 24-hour blood pressure was measured using an ambula-
tory monitor (Meditech ABPM-04; Meditech Ltd) at 0, 3, 6, 9,
and 12 months. The mean of the 24-hour recording was used
asthemainmeasure;daytimeandnighttimereadingswerealso
analyzedseparately.Sensitivityanalysesusingaqualitythresh-
old (minimum of 14 daytime and 7 nighttime readings per
the British Hypertension Society guidance17) were also
performed.
Soluble Markers of Cardiovascular Risk
Solublemarkerswerecollectedatbaselineand3and12months
after a minimum 6-hour fast. Samples were collected for mea-
surement of b-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein, and insulin measurement. Insulin and glu-
cose measurements were used to construct a homeostasis
model assessment of insulin resistance18 using the following
formula: (fasting glucose level × fasting insulin level)/405.
Endothelial Function
Endothelial function was assessed at 0, 3, and 12 months by
measuring flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery in
response to hyperemia (endothelium-dependent vasodila-
tion) after 5 minutes of forearm cuff occlusion using stan-
dard techniques.19 Mean diameter was measured during
baseline acquisition and was compared with the maximum
diameter achieved after cuff deflation. Flow-mediated dila-
tation was then expressed as the percentage change from
baseline diameter.
Pulse Wave Velocity
Carotid-radial pulse wave velocity and augmentation index
were measured using the Sphygmocor applanation tonom-

etry system (AtCor Medical) at 0, 3, and 12 months to give in-
dicesofarterialstiffness.Augmentationindexispresentednor-
malized to a heart rate of 75/min.
Other Biochemical Measurements
We measured the levels of glucose, total cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, triglycerides, serum albumin, calcium, parathy-
roid hormone (PTH), and 25OHD on fasting blood samples.
Screening samples were analyzed in small batches before
enrollment in the trial to ascertain trial eligibility; follow-up
samples were stored and batch analyzed at the end of the
trial. Calcium intake was assessed at baseline using the Scot-
tish Collaborative Group Food Frequency Questionnaire.20
Exercise Capacity and Falls
Exercise capacity was determined by 6-minute walks at 0, 6,
and 12 months.21 The walk test was performed on a 25-m flat
course, using standardized encouragement every 2 minutes.
Fall frequency was prospectively recorded by patients using
monthly diaries.
Statistical Analysis
A2-sidedP< .05wasconsideredsignificantforallanalyses.For
each outcome measure, repeated-measures, mixed-effects
analyses were conducted, with estimation and testing of main
effects of treatment allocation (t test) and group × time inter-
action (F tests). Analyses for outcome measures at individual
time points, including the primary outcome measures, were
based on analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values
of the response variable and levels of the stratification vari-
ables. Analyses were based on a modified intent-to-treat popu-
lation (all participants with baseline and follow-up values of
the response variable being analyzed). We calculated unad-
justed models and models adjusted for baseline values of the
outcome measure under study, along with baseline 25OHD
level, baseline blood pressure, the presence of diabetes, and
age. We also adjusted for use of thiazide diuretics given the
knowneffectsofthesemedicationsoncalciummetabolismand
use of statins given their known interaction with vascular
health and vitamin D metabolism. Sensitivity analyses were
conducted using multiple imputation to account for missing
data and excluding patients with changes in antihyperten-
sive medication type or dose for blood pressure analyses. On
the basis of blood pressure data from a previous vitamin D in-
tervention trial for hypertension,22 we powered the study to
detect a 7-mm Hg between-group difference in systolic blood
pressure change between baseline and 3 months, assuming an
SD change of 18 mm Hg. To detect this change with 80% power
at an α level of .05 required 73 patients per group. We origi-
nally anticipated a dropout rate of 20% and, thus, aimed to re-
cruit 180 patients into the trial.
Results
Patients from 13 primary care practices were invited to
express interest in the trial; a total of 341 agreed to attend
the screening, and of these, 159 were randomized into the
trial from June 1, 2009, through May 31, 2011. The last visit
of the last patient occurred at the end of May 2012. Partici-
pant flow through the trial is shown in Figure 1. The 159 par-
ticipants randomized had a mean age of 76.8 years, a mean
office blood pressure of 163/78 mm Hg, and only minor dif-
ferences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups
(Table 1). Recruitment was terminated at this point because
the dropout rate was lower than projected and the trial was
on course to obtain the required number of completing
participants.
Effect of Intervention on 25OHD Levels
Mean 25OHD levels increased from a baseline level of 18 ng/mL
to 28 ng/mL at 6 months in the intervention group before pla-
teauing. A small (3-ng/mL) increase was seen by 6 months in
the placebo group; the overall effect estimate of the interven-
tion during the 12-month study period was equivalent to a
7-ng/mL increase in 25OHD levels in the intervention group.
Details are shown in Figure 2. Adherence to study medication
was high; 301 of 303 planned doses (99%) were ingested in the
intervention group, and 285 of 294 planned doses (97%) were
ingested in the placebo group. Missing doses were withheld
because of elevated calcium level or suspected medication ad-
verse effects; no participant declined to ingest medication at
any time point.
Primary Outcome Measure
Office systolic blood pressure was not statistically different be-
tween treatment and placebo groups at 3 months (Table 2). Of-
fice systolic blood pressure decreased by a mean (SD) of 2.7
(12.5) mm Hg in the treatment group between baseline and 3
months compared with a smaller mean (SD) decrease of 1.4
(14.9) mm Hg in the placebo group. The between-group treat-
ment effect after adjusting for covariates was −0.7 mm Hg (95%
CI, −5.2 to 3.8 mm Hg; P = .76). Season of recruitment (May-
October vs November-April, reflecting peak and trough 25OHD
levels in population studies) did not change the effect of treat-
ment on blood pressure at 3 months; between-group differ-
ence in systolic blood pressure change was −0.9 mm Hg (95%
CI, −5.3 to 3.5 mm Hg) after adjustment for season. No partici-
pant changed antihypertensive therapy between baseline and
3 months.
Secondary Outcome Mesures
Details of blood pressure change in each group over time are
given in Table 2. No significant between-group differences in
blood pressure at any time point for either office blood pres-
sure or daytime 24-hour blood pressure and no significant be-
tween-group differences on repeated measures analysis were
found. Further analysis that excluded participants with a
change in their antihypertensive medication (1 in the placebo
group and 3 in the vitamin D group by 12 months) revealed no
relevant change in these results. Daytime 24-hour blood pres-
sure results were similar after excluding recordings that had
fewer than 14 daytime readings.

each time point. No significant change in serum calcium

levels was noted, and PTH levels decreased by a small (3.8
pg/mL) but significant amount in the intervention group
relative to placebo.
Subgroup Analyses
A series of hypothesis-generating post hoc interaction analy-
ses were conducted. No significant interaction was found be-
tween baseline 25OHD level, baseline systolic blood pres-
sure, dietary calcium intake, or PTH level (used as continuous
variables) and the treatment effect of vitamin D on systolic
blood pressure. A significant interaction was noted between
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angioten-
sin receptor blocker (ARB) use and treatment effect, with a
greater treatment effect seen in those already taking ACE in-
hibitors or ARB medication (−4 mm Hg vs +8 mm Hg, P = .02).
No significant interaction was seen between the effect of treat-
mentondiastolicbloodpressureandbaseline25OHDlevel,ACE
inhibitor or ARB use, baseline calcium intake, or baseline PTH
level.
Exercise Capacity and Falls
Exercise capacity as measured by a 6-minute walk did not in-
crease by a clinically significant amount with vitamin D
therapy; the between-group difference compared with base-
line was 16 m (95% CI, 2 to 31 m; P = .03) at 6 months and 12 m
(95% CI, −4 to 28 m; P = .13) at 12 months. There were nonsig-
nificantly fewer falls in the vitamin D group during the 12-
month study period (36 vs 46 falls; hazard ratio, 0.77; 95% CI,
0.50 to 1.20; P = .24); the time to first fall in each group was
similar (P = .94 by log-rank test) as was the number of partici-
pants in each group falling at least once (25 in the interven-
tion group and 26 in the placebo group).
Safety
Adverse events were similar in both trial arms, with no sig-
nificant excess of adverse events in any subcategory of events
(eTable in the Supplement). One participant in each group had
an adjusted serum calcium level greater than 10.6 mg/dL (to
convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25) during the

ment.Similarly,3of80participants(4%)inthevitaminDgroup

line during the study.
Discussion
Previous meta-analyses16,23,24 have suggested that vitamin D
supplementationproducesamodestreductioninsystolicblood
pressure between 2 and 4 mm Hg. Selected groups of patients
(eg, patients with type 2 diabetes and patients with elevated
baseline blood pressure)25,26 have demonstrated larger im-
provements in blood pressure with vitamin D supplementa-
tion of 8 to 13 mm Hg. Mixed results have been reported for
the effects of vitamin D on endothelial function and b-type na-
triuretic peptide levels, although significant effects were re-
ported in some studies,22,25-31 and one recent trial did not find
any improvement in arterial stiffness with vitamin D
supplementation.32 Previous trials have not found signifi-
cant effects on lipid profile with vitamin D,33 but in patients
with low 25OHD levels, supplementation may enhance the ef-
fect of statins metabolized via the cytochrome 3A4 pathway.34
Several explanations are possible for the lack of effect of
vitamin D seen in this study. First, vitamin D may have no sig-
nificant effect on blood pressure. The overall effect size seen
by combining small trials to date is modest, and it is possible
that a real biological effect on blood pressure is not present.
AsecondpossibilityisthatvitaminDmaynotreduceblood
pressure in this specific patient group. Vitamin D may not
reverse vascular stiffness and calcification during a 1-year pe-
riod or might only act effectively at an earlier stage in the dis-
ease process. Hypertension in older people is characteristi-
cally not due to elevated renin levels (in contrast to younger
patients); if vitamin D acts predominantly via the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system as has been previously
postulated,35-37 this could explain the lack of effect seen, es-
pecially because 50% to 60% of patients were already taking
ACE inhibitors or ARBs.

Although office blood pressure readings were all in the hy-
pertensive range in this study, mean daytime blood pressures
were markedly lower, with almost 50% of participants having
a daytime mean systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg.
It is possible that a proportion of patients therefore had white-
coat hypertension (ie, elevated blood pressure when mea-
sured by health care professionals but lower blood pressure
at other times), but the known high prevalence of orthostatic
hypotension in older hypertensive patients may also have con-
tributed to this discrepancy; office blood pressures were re-
corded in the supine position, whereas most daytime ambu-
latory readings would be recorded in the seated or standing
position.
A third possibility is that the dose used was insufficient or
incorrect. Intermittent dosing might theoretically have differ-
ent biological effects to daily dosing, and extrapolation from
observationaldatahassuggestedthat25OHDlevelshigherthan
30 ng/mL are required for optimal health.38 The dose used in
this study was sufficient to raise mean nadir levels from 18 to
28 ng/mL, and similar intermittent doses producing similar in-
crements in 25OHD levels have caused marked reductions in
blood pressure in some previous studies.22,25
A fourth possibility is that other permissive factors, for in-
stance, adequate calcium intake, are required for vitamin D to
produce a beneficial effect on blood pressure. Patients in this
study had a high calcium intake (mean, >1 g/d). It is possible

that vitamin D supplementation has little extra effect in cal-
cium-replete individuals; calcium is itself thought to have a
slight antihypertensive effect,39 although a possible deleteri-
ous role in precipitating cardiovascular events is the subject
of ongoing controversy.40 We found no evidence of an inter-
action between calcium intake and the degree of blood pres-
sure lowering on subgroup analysis to support this hypoth-
esis, however.
Cholecalciferol was well tolerated in this trial, with no in-
crease in adverse events compared with placebo. High-dose
cholecalciferol was associated with an increase in falls in a re-
cent trial41; our vitamin D group had a reassuringly low num-
ber of falls, consistent with previous data.42 A small improve-
ment was seen in the 6-minute walk distance in keeping with
previoustrialresults;however,themagnitudeoftheeffectseen
in this study was less than the minimum clinically important
difference of 20 m for the 6-minute walk test.21
Our study has several strengths. The projected final evalu-
able sample size was reached, and the mean age (77 years) was
considerably older than that seen in most hypertension trials.
Patients had a wide range of comorbidity and concomitant
medication use and, thus, the study population reflects that
seen in the real world. Despite enrolling older and sometimes
frailpatients,thedropoutratewasonly11%in12months.Base-
line patient characteristics were well balanced between the 2
groups,andasubstantialincreasein25OHDlevelswasachieved
with the intervention.
Limitations of our study include recruitment from a single
health board area and patients all being of white ethnicity, lim-
iting generalizability. Recent data on the pharmacokinetics of
vitamin D suggest that serum 25OHD levels peak at 7 days be-
fore decreasing, with a half-life of a few weeks.43,44 More fre-
quent doses (ie, monthly or every 2 months) would be more ef-
fectiveatraisingandmaintainingserum25OHDlevels;thislarger
dose of vitamin D could conceivably have had an effect. How-
ever,4-monthadministrationof100 000Uofcholecalciferolwas
effective at increasing 25OHD levels and reducing fractures in
a previous large osteoporosis trial,45 a finding that under-
pinned our choice of dose timing for the current trial. Ambula-
torybloodpressurewassomewhatlowerthanexpected,which
may have limited our ability to demonstrate reductions in am-
bulatorybloodpressure.Thesizeofourtrialmeansthatasmall
beneficialeffectonbloodpressurestillcannotbeexcluded,but
the clinical relevance of such small improvements, at least at
an individual patient level, is questionable.
Our results do not lend support to performing large ran-
domized controlled trials aimed specifically at blood pres-
sure reduction, at least in this patient group. It is still pos-
sible, however, that vitamin D supplementation could have
beneficial effects on cardiovascular health via non–blood
pressure effects,46 and ongoing large randomized trials are
due to report on this in the next few years. In the meantime,
our results do not support the use of high-dose, intermittent
cholecalciferol to treat ISH in older white patients.
