recruitment, compliance and retention - a
randomized controlled trial comparison with a
blinded, placebo-controlled design

Background
In randomized trials there may be no overriding reason whether or not
to have a placebo control.
Purpose We assessed the effects of an open trial design (no placebo and people
know what tablets they are given) compared with a blinded, placebo-controlled
design on recruitment, compliance and retention within a randomized trial of
secondary osteoporotic fracture prevention.
Methods We undertook a randomized controlled comparison nested within a
placebo-controlled trial of nutritional supplementation amongst people aged 70 years
or over who had previously sustained a fracture, recruited in a UK teaching hospital.
Randomization was 2:1 in favour of the blinded, placebo-controlled trial design.
Results
From 180 eligible participants randomized to receive information based on
the open trial design, 134 (74.4%) consented to take part, compared with 233
(65.1%) of 358 people randomized to the blinded, placebo-controlled design
(difference 9.4%, 95% confidence interval 1.3-17.4%). Reluctance to take a placebo
and the desire to know tablet allocation were reasons given for not taking part in the
blinded, placebo-controlled design. There was no significant difference in tablet
compliance. Open trial participants were more likely to remain in the trial for one year
(difference 13.9%, 95% confidence interval 3.1-24.6%), mainly reflecting the high
retention of the open trial no tablet group compared to the open trial tablet group
(difference 23.6%, 95% confidence interval 11.9-35.2%). The odds ratio for
reporting an adverse event in the open trial compared to the blinded, placebo-
controlled design was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.28-1.49), and for reporting a
fracture was 0.81 (0.36-1.85).
Concluslons We conclude that using an open trial design may enhance participant
recruitment and retention and thus improve generalizability and statistical power, but
withdrawal rates may differ between the study allocations and may threaten the
intemal validity of the trial. Clinical Trals 2004; 1: 490-498. www.SCTjournal.com

health care. An open ("open-label") trial design
where both the participant and caregiver know
the therapy and where there is no placebo group
(instead this group receives 'no treatment")
is
closer to usual practice [1]. It might therefore give
a better estimate of differential effects in normal
care as this design would incorporate any effect
modification such as enhanced motivation from
knowing the treatment.
The choice between these designs carries other
implications for a trial's validity and these may
be important when there is no overriding reason
to
isolate
or
incorporate
any
placebo
effect.
Potential trial participants might be reluctant to
accept the
possibility that they will
receive
a
placebo or not know the nature of their allocation
and may therefore decline to take part. Thus, a
blinded,
placebo-controlled
trial
could
lead
to
under recruitment and participation
of people
who
are
less
representative
of the population
under investigation
as a whole. On the other
hand, later differential withdrawal from the trial
groups might be more likely if participants know
what they have been
allocated,
particularly
if
there is a "no treatment" group, thus potentially
introducing attrition bias in an open design. The
choice of design might also affect compliance.
Participants may be more
likely
to adhere
if
they know what
"active"
treatment
they
are
taking, whereas participants allocated open "no
treatment",
if
disappointed,
might
be
more
likely to seek the intervention treatment outside
the trial.
We used the opportunity provided by the UK
Medical Research Council sponsored RECORD trial
to examine these issues further, specifically whether
those eligible were: a) more likely to consent to take
part; b) more likely to comply with treatment; and c)
more likely to withdraw after entry in an open
randomized trial design compared with a blinded,
placebo-controlled randomized trial design. The
standard RECORD trial is a randomized double-
blind placebo-controlled,
factorial design, evalu-
ation of oral calcium (1 g daily) and/or vitamin D
(800 IU/20 jig) supplementation in the secondary
prevention of osteoporotic fractures [2]. We com-
pared this with an open trial design, which was
otherwise identical.
Methods
Ethical approval
The Multicentre Research Ethics Committee for
Scotland and the Lothian Research Ethics Commit-
tee approved both the RECORD trial and the study
reported here.
Study sample
Participants were recruited in the Edinburgh centre
of the UK RECORD trial between July 2000 and July
2001. People eligible for the RECORD trial were
identified from the hospital notes, and seen either
in a fracture clinic or on an orthopaedic ward. Full
details of the RECORD trial are available elsewhere
[2]. Participants had had an osteoporotic fracture
within the last 10 years, were aged 70 years or over,
and had none of the prespecified exclusion criteria.
Patients were also ineligible if they had daily oral
treatment with more than 200 IU (5 ,ug) vitamin D
or more than 500 mg calcium or other bone active
medications.
Procedure
The study nurse approached people eligible for the
RECORD trial and asked if they were interested in
helping with a study looking at vitamin D and/or
calcium for the prevention of another fracture. As
far as possible all consecutive eligible people were
approached. However, this was not always possible;
for example, when two eligible patients were sitting
next to each other in out-patients, there was a risk of
group contamination. Potential participants were
informed that they had a three out of four chance of
getting real treatment and that the study would last
until 2003, with questionnaires and tablets sent out
by post every four months.
The study nurse then used a preprogrammed
laptop computer to generate random allocation to
either the open trial design or the blinded, placebo-
controlled trial design in a 1: 2 ratio. The unequal
allocation was chosen so that the majority joined
the standard RECORD trial. Randomization was
minimized [3] by age (under 80 years or 80 years and
over),
sex, time since fracture (previous three
months or longer) and type of enrolling fracture
(proximal femur, distal forearm, clinical vertebral
and other).
The study nurse gave a full explanation of the
allocated study design: either the open randomized
trial design (participants would be told to which
compound they had been allocated, whether
vitamin D, calcium, vitamin D and calcium, or no
tablets) or the conventional RECORD trial (the
randomized blinded, placebo-controlled
trial of
vitamin D, calcium, vitamin D and calcium, or
placebo). The nurse described the study design with
information leaflets, which were similar in appear-
ance. The nurse had
initial training and was
regularly observed undertaking recruitment to
ensure that information was consistent, well
explained and as specified in the protocol.

Written consent was then collected. The nurse
recorded the exact wording used by people to
describe why they did not wish to take part. Reasons
given for declining were coded into areas with
common themes by one study investigator, who was
blinded to group allocation.
Randomization within study design and follow-up
Tablets and questionnaires were subsequently sent
by post from the trial co-ordinating centre. The
covering letter and tablet bottles sent to participants
in the open
trial gave details of their study
allocation. Participants' family doctors also received
information about the open trial allocation. At
subsequent four monthly intervals participants
received further tablets as required by the trial
design, and all participants received questionnaires
identical in appearance to return by reply paid mail
to the trial office. These questionnaires included
questions on self-reported supplement consump-
tion (trial tablets, purchases over the counter and
prescriptions by family doctors),
fractures and
adverse events. With the mailing at eight months,
all participants receiving tablets were asked to
return unconsumed tablets in order to conduct a
tablet count for compliance.
Outcome measures
The main outcome measures were: a) the pro-
portions of eligible participants recruited under the
two trial designs; b) the proportions compliant
(taking tablets on more than 80% of days) on pill
counts at eight months after randomisation; and c)
the proportions of participants remaining in the
study at one year
(i.e., had not withdrawn).
Secondary outcomes were reasons given for declin-
ing to take part and withdrawal, self-reported tablet
consumption, and commencement of calcium and
vitamin D supplements purchased over the counter
and prescribed by the family doctor. Reported
adverse events and fractures were also collected.
Sample size calculation
Initial work on the RECORD trial indicated that
.60% of eligible patients agreed to participate in
the trial. Assuming a 1: 2 randomization ratio, it was
calculated that 540 people would be required to
estimate a relative difference in recruitment of
20%, i.e., a difference from 60 to 72% (with 80%
power, 2P < 0.05) between the trial groups. This
comparison of trial designs was not powered to
examine differences in reporting of adverse events
or fractures.
Statistical methods
The proportions of the two groups recruited were
compared by multivariate logistic regression, adjust-
ing for the minimization variables age, sex, type of
fracture and time since fracture [4].
The proportions of participants remaining in
the trial after 12 months were compared using
the log-rank test within a multidecrement
life
table approach, where participants who died were
censored at the date of death. The confidence
interval for the difference in proportions were based
on the life table estimates.
Differences between groups
for compliance,
adverse events and fractures were examined by
Newcombe's method [5].
Results
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the
various groups compared and Figure 1 summarizes
the participants' flow through the study.
Recruitment under the two trial designs
Five hundred and thirty-eight participants took
part; 180 were allocated to the open design and 358
to the placebo design. The groups were well
balanced; their mean ages were 77 and 78 years,
83% were women, the preceding fracture was
proximal femur or distal forearm for 50% of people,
and 93% of the participants had had their fracture
within the previous three months.
Of the 180 people given information about the
open trial design, 134 (74.4%) consented, compared
with 233 (65.1%) of 358 given information about
the blinded, placebo-controlled design [difference
9.4%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-17.4%; odds
ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.05-2.33]. The odds ratio was
not materially influenced by adjusting for age, sex,
type of fracture and time since fracture (OR 1.58,
95% CI 1.06-2.36).
Table 2 describes the reasons given for declining
to take part (some people gave more than one
reason). The larger proportion of people declining
to take part in the blinded, placebo-controlled
design reflected not wanting to take more tablets,
wanting a named medication, or wanting to see
their GP, as well as not wanting to take a placebo and
wanting to know what was in the tablets.

Characteristics of participants taking part In the
two trial designs
Table 1 also gives details of those who were recruited
to the designs, overall and according to their actual
allocations. The groups compared were similar at
baseline, despite differences in the proportions
recruited to the two study designs.
Tablet compliance
Compliance amongst those who returned their
tablet containers was similar (overall 85
versus
84.5% of tablet takers took their tablets on more
than 80% of days; Table 3). The same pattern was
observed for self-reported tablet consumption at
four, eight or 12 months during the study (data not
shown).
Withdrawals
Figure 2 presents the percentage of total participants
still taking part in the trial designs during the year.
Open trial design participants as a group were more
likely to remain in the trial for longer (difference
13.9%, 95% CI 3.1-24.6%). This difference was
mainly due to more people remaining in the trial in
the open trial design no tablet group compared to
the open trial tablet group (difference 23.6%, 95%
CI 11.9-35.2%) (Figure 3). There was no apparent
difference in those remaining in the trial between
the placebo and active groups in the blinded design
group (difference -0.6%, 95% Cl - 17.9-16.7%).
There was, however, a tendency for the open trial
design tablet group to be less likely to withdraw
than the active tablet group in the blinded, placebo-
controlled design group (difference 7.5%, 95% CI
- 5.9-20.9%). There was no statistically significant
difference in gender, age, type of fracture, or time
since fracture in those who dropped out in the two
trial designs.
The overall difference was explained by fewer
participants in the open trial design changing their
minds about participation, or having difficulties
with taking tablets or taking too many tablets as
reasons for withdrawal (Table 4). No participant
gave unhappiness with blinding or the possibility of
taking a placebo as a reason for withdrawal.
Reported adverse events and fractures
Reported adverse events and fractures are given in

differences between the groups. The odds ratio

Calcium and vitamin D purchases over the counter
and prescription by family doctors
No participant in either
trial design reported
purchasing calcium or vitamin D supplements
over the counter. One participant in the open
trial design and one participant in the placebo-
controlled design were prescribed vitamin D
supplements by their family doctor. No calcium
supplements were prescribed
in the placebo-
controlled design, and three participants in the
open trial design were prescribed calcium.
Discussion
This
is the
first study to use an experimental
design to assess the impact of an open rather than
placebo-controlled design on recruitment, compli-
ance and retention. Selection bias was avoided in
the comparison of recruitment by randomly allocat-
ing eligible people to the designs, and the trial was
large enough to identify a plausible difference. We
recognize, however, that this is a single case study in
a specific group of people and acknowledge that at
least some of the differential effects will be different
in other trial settings.

We found
that
these
older
people
with
a
history of osteoporotic fracture were less likely to
consent to join a randomized trial with a blinded,
placebo-controlled design. Unwillingness to take a
placebo
and
the
desire
to know
the
tablet
allocation were reasons mentioned when declin-
ing. Others have found that having a placebo
group may reduce
the
proportion
of patients
willing to take part in clinical trials of treatments
for cancer and
schizophrenia
[6-9].
However,
these
studies
did
not
investigate
specifically
whether it was the chance of not receiving the
"active"
treatment,
the
possibility of taking
a
dummy tablet, or the blinding to allocation that
influenced patients. Welton et al. [10] examined
whether willingness to take part in a hypothe-
tical
randomized
controlled
trial
of hormone
replacement therapy might be influenced by a
placebo arm in the trial. In this quasi-randomized
study, women received information about one of
two trial scenarios: with three groups including
one placebo arm, or with only the two treatment
arms. Women were blinded in both trial designs.
Women
were 9% more
likely
to
indicate
a
willingness to take part if there was no placebo,
a result of borderline significance (95% Cl 0-18%)
but similar to the difference in recruitment found
here.
In the present study, participants had an equal
chance of not receiving the "active" treatment,
irrespective of the trial design. The lower recruit-
ment
rate
in
the
blinded,
placebo-controlled
design seems,
therefore,
to
relate
to the wish
to avoid taking unnecessary, unspecified tablets

randomized trial design could produce results that
are more generalizable (and also statistically more
powerful), by increasing the proportion of eligible
patients recruited.
Once recruited, knowledge that
a tablet was
"active" and knowing what it actually was did not
appear to have an effect on compliance amongst
those allocated tablets. This should be interpreted
cautiously however. The estimates are imprecise and
this also assumes that those who did not return their
containers were similar to those who did.
and the blinded, placebo-controlled trial (RECORD) according
Those in the open design were more likely to still
be in the trial at one year. In principle, it might be
expected that those allocated no treatment in an
open design might be most likely to withdraw. In
the event, they proved least likely to in this study.
The extra withdrawals in the placebo design were
due to changing minds, difficulty taking the tablets,
or complaining of taking too many tablets. Never-
theless, the differential withdrawal rates in the open
group could still introduce more bias; this may
offset the advantages of having larger numbers in
the analysis.
The people studied were
all
over 70
years,
mostly women, with recent osteoporotic fractures.

Odds ratio for reporting adverse event, all in open trial design versus all in blinded, placebo-controlled design 0.64 (95% Cl
0.28-1.49).
Odds ratio for reporting fracture, all in open trial design versus all in blinded, placebo-controlled design 0.81 (95% Cl 0.36-1.85).
Common reasons for declining or withdrawing,
irrespective of study design, were the wish not to
take tablets or not to take more tablets. As older
people often already take many medications, the
desire to avoid further, unspecified medicines may
be particularly strong. This clearly had a major
impact on the ways in which they responded.
Nevertheless,
this study has
illustrated the
complex and potentially competing implications
of choosing between open or placebo-controlled
designs. In some circumstances, there will be no
option but to perform an open trial because the use
of a placebo is impossible, impractical or unethical.
In other circumstances, placebos will continue to be
used where there are likely strong placebo effects
and it is judged important to isolate them. The
choice may also depend on whether or not unbiased
assessment of outcome
is possible without a
placebo. Trials are less likely to require a placebo
where there are objective trial endpoints, such as
mortality or myocardial infarction [11], which are
unlikely to be influenced by participant, investi-
gator and outcome assessor preferences.
In many trials, like the one considered here, there
will be no overriding reason for or against a placebo
to eliminate a placebo effect. This study suggests
that each design has advantages and disadvantages.
The decision card introduce (or avoid) performance,
attrition and detection bias, decrease (or enhance)
generalizability, and influence statistical power. This
suggests that these competing considerations
should be weighed tip on a case by case basis before
a decision is taken about blinding and placebo use.
Contexts will differ and further research is needed to
clarify the advantages and disadvantages in other
patient groups and settings.
