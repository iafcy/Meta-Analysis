Context: Bone health is influenced by the intake of both calcium and vitamin D.
Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the influence of calcium and vitamin D supplementation
on PTH and bone turnover.
Setting, Patients, and Design: At an ambulatory research center, 159 postmenopausal healthy
white women participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel, longitudinal factorial
study that was 6 months in duration.
Interventions: Subjects were randomly allocated to 4 groups: 1) double placebo, 2) calcium (1200
mg daily) plus placebo, 3) vitamin D3 (100 g) plus placebo, and 4) vitamin D3 and calcium. Serum
and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.
Main Outcome Measures: Serum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I
N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured.
Results: Before study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase
in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation
but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups
in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the
vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium.
Conclusions: Fasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium
intake. Supplementation of the diet with 1200 mg calcium/d reduces bone turnover markers,
whereas supplementation with up to100 g vitamin D3/d does not. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98:
E1702–E1709, 2013)
T
he recent Institute of Medicine (IOM) report on di-
etary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D
recommended a calcium intake of 1200 mg/d for those
over 50 years old with a tolerable upper limit (UL) of 2000
mg/d (1–3). Vitamin D intake of 600 IU/d from age 50 to
70, and 800 IU/d over 71 years for the recommended daily
allowance (RDA) with an upper limit of 4000 IU/d was
recommended. These dietary reference intakes have been
challenged in an Endocrine Society Clinical Guideline that
implied that vitamin D intake should be substantially
higher in much of the population (1500–2000 IU for the
RDAand10,000IUfortheUL)(4).Bothconclusionswere
based on the indicator bone health, a composite of factors
including fracture prevention, bone loss, and osteomala-
cia. Other nonskeletal indicators of vitamin D sufficiency
have been proposed, but neither the IOM nor the Endo-
crine Society found sufficient evidence that informed the
formulation of an RDA for vitamin D using these putative
biomarkers (1, 2, 4, 5).
Clinical trials of fracture prevention confirm a benefi-
cial effect of calcium with vitamin D supplementation in
combination (6). However, it is difficult to discern the

separate contributions of these nutrients. In a previous
study, we examined the influence of calcium intake and
vitamin D separately as well as their interaction on bio-
markers of skeletal nutritional sufficiency, ie, serum PTH
and bone turnover markers (7). Because vitamin D enables
calcium absorption, studies were also performed after a
calcium load to examine the influence of calcium and vi-
tamin D supplementation in the postabsorptive state. Cal-
cium supplementation was found to lower bone turnover
markers, but supplementation with 4000 IU vitamin D
daily had no effect on bone turnover or PTH levels.
Several weaknesses in this previous study were recog-
nized. The study population was not uniform in gender, eth-
nicity, or age, and the study duration was only 3 months. As
a result of these limitations, we decided to repeat this study
in a more uniform population of postmenopausal white
women with a larger sample size and greater study duration.
Our goal was to reexamine the influence of calcium and/or
vitaminDsupplementationonboneturnoverandPTHlevels
in the fasting and postprandial states.
Subjects and Methods
A total of 363 healthy postmenopausal white participants were
recruited from Winthrop University Hospital and its surround-
ing area (Figure 1). Participation in this trial began in December
2008 and ended in April 2011. Recruitment was carried out
during winter in consecutive years through e-mail, advertise-
ments in the local paper, and a direct mail campaign. Subjects
were enrolled in two consecutive winters. Exclusion criteria in-
cluded any chronic medical illness, osteoporosis, pregnancy, use
of medications that influence bone metabolism or interfere with
vitamin D metabolism, and unexplained weight loss during the
previous year. Participants agreed to refrain from increasing di-
etary calcium intake or from taking self-prescribed calcium or
vitamin D supplements during the study.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
Winthrop University Hospital. All participants gave written con-
sent before participation in any study-related activity. All par-
ticipants and investigators were blinded to allocation through-
out the study except for the research pharmacist and the
statistical group. A total of 159 subjects qualified and consented
to the study.
Subjects had a baseline screening visit followed by an initial
randomization visit and then visits 15 and 28 weeks later. A
complete medical history and physical examination was done. A
3-day dietary questionnaire was filled out by participants to as-
sess daily calcium and vitamin D intake. Body weight and height
(using a Harpenden stadiometer) were recorded. Baseline fasting
laboratory tests included serum calcium, phosphorus, serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
(1,25(OH)2D), serum PTH, serum cross-linked C-telopeptide
(CTX), serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP),
and fasting urine calcium and creatinine (8, 9). After collecting
fasting blood and urine samples, participants were given a 600-mg
calcium tablet in the form of calcium carbonate with a light break-
fast to eat. Breakfast consisted of tea or coffee with a small amount
of milk and two slices of white bread (40 mg of calcium per slice)
with butter. Two hours after the oral calcium load, serum calcium,
1,25(OH)2D, PTH, CTX, and P1NP and urine calcium/creatinine
(Ca/Cr) were again measured. The fasting and calcium load studies
described above were repeated at each visit.
At the second baseline visit, 159 participants who qualified for the
study were assigned to 1 of 4 groups by a simple randomization: 1)
placebo vitamin D3 supplement and active calcium supplement, 2)
active vitamin D3 supplement and placebo
calcium supplement, 3) both active vitamin
D3 and active calcium supplements, and 4)
both placebo vitamin D3 and placebo cal-
cium supplements. All subjects took one
600-mg tablet of calcium (or placebo) in the
morning and in the evening for a dose of
1200 mg daily (or no calcium). Vitamin D3
supplements were administered in 50-g
capsules. All subjects took one dose of vita-
min D3 (or placebo) in the morning and one
intheeveningforadoseof100g(4000IU)

comitant medications or adverse events were recorded. At
4-week intervals, subjects were contacted to encourage compli-
ance and record any adverse events. Participants returned for
visits after 15 and 28 weeks. The 3-day dietary record was col-
lected along with the remaining pills. A pill count was done as a
means of measuring compliance. Vital signs, height, weight, and
travel history were collected. Any concomitant medications and
adverse events were recorded. Fasting serum calcium, serum
25(OH)D, serum PTH, serum CTX, and serum P1NP were col-
lected. Fasting urine samples were analyzed for calcium and cre-
atinine. Participants were given a 600-mg calcium tablet (cal-
cium carbonate) again accompanied by a light breakfast. After 2
hours, postprandial blood and urine samples were collected. All
unused study medication was collected and counted to evaluate
for compliance. Vitamin D3 capsules were custom manufactured
by Tishcon Corp, and their content was verified in an indepen-
dent laboratory (Vitamin D, Skin, and Bone Research Labora-
tory,DepartmentofMedicine,BostonUniversitySchoolofMed-
icine, Boston, Massachusetts).
Biochemistry
Serum 25(OH)D was measured by an
RIA from DiaSorin, Inc. The minimum
and maximum detectable levels are 3.75
and 250 nmol/L, respectively. The intra-
assay precision (coefficient of variation)
for the mean of 21.5 nmol/L is 11.7%
and for the mean of 122.5 nmol/L is
12.5%. The overall intra-assay variabil-
ity in our laboratory is 4.1%, and inter-
assay variability is 7.0%. Our laboratory
participatesinandhasbeencertifiedcon-
tinuously since 2005 by the Vitamin D
External Quality Assessment Scheme, an
external quality control program (10).
The reference range for serum 25(OH)D
is 50 to 125 nmol/L. Serum and urinary
calcium were measured by O-cresol-
phthalein
complex
using
automated
equipment Dimension-RXL (Dade Beh-
ring). Urinary creatinine was measured
by Jaffe reaction with automated instru-
mentation Dimension-RXL. Serum PTH
was measured by the Immulite 2000 an-
alyzer for the quantitative measurement
of intact PTH (Diagnostic Products
Corp). Serum CTX was measured by the
Serum Crosslaps ELISA kit made by
Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics. Serum
P1NP was measured using the UniQ
P1NP RIA kit from Orion Diagnostica.
Serum CTX provides a measure of bone
resorption, and P1NP is a marker of type
I collagen synthesis. Serum 1,25(OH)2D

concentrations were measured by an ELISA kit made by Immu-
nodiagnostic Systems. The inter- and intra-assay variability in
our laboratory is 17% and 10%, respectively, The reference
range for this assay is 39 to 193 pmol/L.
Nutrition assessment
Total daily calcium and vitamin D intake was estimated from
a 3-day diet history using Nutrition Pro nutrition analysis soft-
ware (11).
Statistical methodology
The study consisted of 159 subjects at baseline with obser-
vations collected at 3 time points (baseline and 15 and 28 weeks).
Simple randomization was performed at baseline using a com-
puter-generated randomization list, and subjects were assigned
to 1 of the 4 groups, namely placebo, vitamin D alone, calcium
alone, and vitamin D plus calcium. All enrollments occurred in
winter. The number of subjects varied at each time point due to
dropouts. A total of 120 subjects completed the study.
Descriptive statistics are reported as mean (SD). A repeated-
measures mixed-effect model (SAS Proc GLIMMIX) was used
for all primary analysis where time, calcium, and vitamin D were
taken as fixed effects. The mixed-effect model under the assump-
tion of ignorability (12) allowed us to include all subjects even
with the missing data at any time point, thus keeping intact the
intent-to-treat principle. We considered both 2-way and 3-way
interaction terms between time, calcium, and vitamin D. A sub-
ject-specific random slope was also included in the model, and
unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used throughout.
In each analysis, we were interested to find the significance of the
interaction term between calcium and vitamin D with time. A
post hoc power analysis revealed that our baseline sample size
was large enough to detect this 2-way fixed-effect interaction
with sufficient power (80%) but was not sufficient (80%) to
detecta3-wayinteractionbetweentime,calcium,andvitaminD.
Consistent with the previous study by our group (7), we calcu-
lated this power for a moderate effect size as described in Cohen
(13). The significance of each term (interaction and main effects)
is reported via a traditional F test obtained from a mixed-effect
ANOVA using SAS software version 9.2. A two-tailed P value 
.05 was used to determine significance, and  (type-1 error) was
kept fixed at 0.05. No statistical correction of P value is reported
for multiple comparisons because this has an inflationary effect
on the P value (11). Hence, finding a P value close to a .05
threshold should be taken as exploratory in nature and requires
confirmation with a larger study.
Results
Demographics
There were no significant differences between the study
groups in age, BMI, or dietary intake of calcium (Table 1).
There were also no significant differences in baseline lab-
oratory values. Mean dietary calcium intake was less
than the recommended intake of the IOM, and mean se-
rum 25(OH)D was above the RDA-associated serum
25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L but below The En-
docrine Society’s recommended value of 70 to 80 nmol/L.
There were no significant group differences in dietary cal-
cium throughout this study.
The distribution of baseline fasting PTH was as fol-
lows: 65 pg/mL, n  6. The baseline 25(OH)D distri-
bution was as follows: 50 nmol/L, n  35; 50 nmol/L
and less than 75 nmol/L, n  73. Four subjects had serum
25(OH)D 50 nmol/L and PTH 65 pg/mL. Serum fast-
ing CTX and P1NP were above the reference range in 24
and 17 participants, respectively.
A total of 363 women were screened, and 159 were
enrolled. Final analyses were done on 159 subjects.
Influence 2 hours after a calcium load before
intervention (n  159)
The influence of the calcium load performed on all sub-
jects (n  159) before intervention may be seen in Figure
2. There was no change in serum creatinine or 25(OH)D,
as expected. Serum calcium increased slightly (P  .0001)
accompanied by a decline in serum PTH (P  .0001).
Serum CTX and P1NP declined significantly, and there
was a significant increase in urine calcium.
Values after intervention assignment in the 4
groups in the fasting state
DataarepresentedinTable2.Therewerenosignificant
interaction terms (time  vitamin D and time  calcium)
in the fasting state for serum creatinine or calcium and for
urine Ca/Cr. There was a significant decline in bone turn-
over markers for calcium supplementation: P1NP (P 
.002) and CTX (P  .001), but no interaction was ob-
served for the vitamin D interventions. Findings were sim-
ilar when baseline PTH or the bone turnover markers were
used as covariates. There was a significant decline (P 
.03) in serum 1,25(OH)2D for the calcium but not the
vitamin D intervention.
Fasting serum PTH trended downward for the vitamin
D intervention (P  .075) and for the calcium intervention
(P  .096). The variability in the fasting serum PTH values
was notable. Because of the significant correlation be-
tween baseline and subsequent values of PTH, baseline
adjusted analysis of PTH was performed (Figure 3). In this
analysis, there was a significant decline in PTH over time
as captured by the interaction between time and vitamin D
(F1,113  4.07, P  .046) and a nonsignificant decline in
the calcium (F1,113  2.26, P  .13) groups. The slope of
change of PTH over time was significant for the combined
treatment group (P  .0003). A separate analysis of PTH
was also done comparing individual groups with placebo
alone. There were significant differences in the vitamin D
(P  .05) and combined groups (P  .02) and a trend with
the calcium group (P  .07).

Values after intervention in the 4 groups after a
calcium load
Response to the oral calcium load for each relevant
parameter is also given in Table 2. Again, as expected,
therewasnochangeinfastingcreatinineorserumcalcium.
Calcium intervention resulted in declines after ingestion of
a calcium load for PTH, (P  .038), P1NP (P  .002), and
CTX (P  .003). Serum PTH declined from the fasting
levels in the vitamin D intervention (P  .038). During
supplementation, the decline in PTH after a calcium load
was higher in both vitamin D treatment groups (for com-
bined P  .03). The placebo and calcium-alone groups did
not differ significantly from the fasting results.
Response of vitamin D metabolites
The response of serum 25(OH)D in the vitamin D-sup-
plemented groups is depicted in Supplemental Figure 1
(published on The Endocrine Society’s Journals Online
website at http://jcem.endojournals.org). The dose re-
sponse is curvilinear. In the fasting state, the calcium in-
take group experienced a significant decline in calcitriol
over time (F1,259  4.74, P  .03). A similar response was
seen in the calcium-loaded state, with an even lower P
value (F1,260  11.26, P  .001), suggesting a larger effect
size. Serum calcitriol in the vitamin D treatment group
showed a trend toward increase (Supplemental Figure 2).
Compliance and adverse events
Compliance (pill count) was 78% for vitamin D and
78% for calcium. There were no differences in compliance
for any group. There were no serious adverse events in the
study. Reported adverse events are given in Table 3 using
a scheme similar to MedDRA. The patients who dropped
out because of adverse events were as follows: placebo
group, 1 for flank pain; vitamin D group, 1 for a sprained
ankle and 1 for arthralgia; calcium plus vitamin D group,
1 for constipation, 1 for upset stomach, 1 for palpitations
and headaches; and calcium group, 1 for upset stomach
and 1 for leg cramps and weakness. No change in mean
serum calcium or phosphate was seen in the fasting state.
One incident of transient hypercalcemia was noted in the
calcium plus vitamin D group.
Using 0.23 for the upper limit for the urine Ca/Cr ratio
in the fasting state during the intervention periods, the
frequency of values exceeding this concentration was
highest in the combined treatment group (10 instances,
compared with 1–2 in the other groups). Using the less
sensitive value for defining hypercalciuria of a Ca/Cr
greater than 0.37, there was only 1 episode of hypercal-

Discussion
This study provides insight into the response to dietary
supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D. Before
group assignment, a calcium load resulted in significant
declines in PTH and bone turnover markers (CTX and
P1NP) and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. The
increase in urinary calcium excretion presumably reflects
thecalciumloadthatisnotused.Theseresponsesarelikely
seen after each ingestion of a calcium supplement (or cal-
cium-rich meal) and result in a postprandial decrease in
PTH and bone resorption. After long-term dietary sup-
plementation, a decline in fasting PTH is observed with
vitamin D supplementation, likely as a result of genomic
effects of calcitriol on the parathyroid (14). Although cal-
cium supplementation appropriately suppresses calcitriol
levels with high vitamin D intake (in the absence of cal-
cium supplementation), calcitriol levels do not decline
from baseline even when a calcium load suppresses PTH.
Calcium loading is more effective in suppressing PTH in
the presence of vitamin D supplementation.
These findings are consistent with our previous study
that was not age-, race-, or gender-specific and found that
calcium supplementation reduced bone turnover markers
but vitamin D supplementation did not (7). This finding is
consistent with a recent food fortification study with a
similar design and other studies as well (15).
The decline in PTH under high-calcium/high-25(OH)D
conditions may represent a pharmacologic effect. Sai et
al (14) noted that serum PTH declines continuously up
to 150 nmol/L. They propose that this decline may be
the result of pharmacologic effects of higher serum
25(OH)D or calcitriol on the vitamin D response ele-
ment in the PTH gene (14). In concert with earlier stud-
ies, we found that serum calcitriol concentration rises
with increasing doses of vitamin D supplementation
(see Supplemental Figure 2) (16).
The mean baseline dietary calcium intake in the current
study was over 900 mg/d, and baseline serum 25(OH)D
was above 45 nmol/L, yet calcium supplementation did
reduce bone turnover despite some studies that would not
have predicted this (17, 18). Because this was not a dose-
response study, we can only conclude that 1200 mg/d of
calcium supplements is more effective in reducing bone
turnoverthananunsupplementedintakeof900mg/d.The
calcium intake in the current study was at the UL (2000
mg/d) recommended by the IOM. The UL value was based
on an increased risk of kidney stones observed in the cal-
cium supplementation arm of the Women’s Health Initia-
tive (19).
In our previous study, bone turnover markers showed
a trend to increase in the high vitamin D group (3). In the
current, more homogeneous study, an increase in bone
turnover was not observed in the high vitamin D group.
Thus, with intakes of vitamin D at the current UL (4000
IU/d), we found no evidence for adverse effects on bone
health in terms of increased bone turnover. The risk of

increased bone turnover at the UL proposed by The En-
docrine Society (10 000 IU/d) is unknown.
We speculate that increasing calcium intake after the
calcitriol-dependentprocessissaturatedwillresultintran-
scellular transport and a decline in postabsorptive PTH
levels. The decline in PTH after the calcium load at base-
line in our study was notable. The effect of increased cal-
cium intake can best be detected in the postabsorptive
rather than the fasting state. The intermittent effect of
calcium intake can be readily detected on the bone turn-
over markers, indicating a sustained effect on bone turn-
over. In contrast, vitamin D may have a genomic effect on
PTH secretion but at high levels may act directly to in-
crease bone remodeling, thereby counteracting any bene-
ficial influence of PTH secretion on bone turnover (5). A
recent study found that standard vitamin D therapy de-
creased bone turnover to a greater extent than very high
doses (the equivalent of 6500 IU/d) (15).
There are several limitations of this study. A 24-hour
measurement of PTH would have been preferable as
would a larger sample size. There has been a great deal of
discussion in recent years about the most accurate assay
for serum 25(OH)D (20). However, our laboratory was
certified by the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment
Scheme when these analyses were performed and was
within the all-laboratory trimmed mean (ALTM). Fur-
thermore, this study was performed in subjects who had
baseline serum 25(OH)D levels actually above the serum
25(OH)D-linked RDA recommendations of the IOM.
Nonetheless, the conditions of this study are similar to
advicethatmaybegiventowomencurrently,anditisclear
that increased calcium supplementation reduced bone
turnover, whereas increasing serum 25(OH)D (above 50
nmol/L) did not.
Our study supports the benefit of high calcium intake
in reducing bone turnover in postmenopausal white
women. The placebo group had a mean daily calcium in-
take of 946 mg. Bone turnover was significantly reduced
by the addition of 1200 mg/d of calcium supplements and
further reduced by a calcium load. Current recommenda-
tions for nutritional intake of calcium heavily relied on
calcium balance studies (1). It is unknown whether this
effect would be sustained or whether it only reflects the
remodeling transient, although it has been sustained in
some studies (21–23). Moreover, it is unknown whether
this is a pharmacologic effect and what the long-term
safety of very high calcium intake may be (24). Our com-
bined calcium/vitamin D group had more instances of hy-
percalciuria. Hypercalciuria has been observed in other
studies as well (5, 13, 16). Studies using a less sensitive
definition of hypercalciuria (ie, 0.37 Ca/Cr) may not have
noted its presence (25).
