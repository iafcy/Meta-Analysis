ABSTRACT
Daily vitamin D in addition to calcium supplementation reduces falls and fractures in older women. However, poor adherence to therapy
is a common clinical problem. To examine the effects of supervised oral 3-monthly vitamin D therapy on falls, muscle strength, and
mobility, we conducted a 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 686 community-dwelling ambulant women
aged over 70 years. Participants received either oral cholecalciferol 150,000 IU every 3 months (n ¼ 353) or an identical placebo (n ¼ 333).
All participants were advised to increase dietary calcium intake. Falls data were collected 3-monthly. At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months,
muscle strength was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility by the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Serum 25 hydroxyvitamin
D (25OHD) was measured in a subgroup of 40 subjects. Mean age at baseline was 76.7  4.1 years. The average serum 25OHD value at
baseline was 65.8  22.7 nmol/L. By 3, 6, and 9 months after supplementation, 25OHD levels of the vitamin D group were approximately
15 nmol/L higher than the placebo group. Calcium intake did not change significantly between baseline (864  412 mg/day) and
9 months (855  357 mg/day). Faller rates in the two groups did not differ: vitamin D group, 102 of 353 (29%); placebo group, 89 of 333
(27%). At 9 months, compared to placebo or baseline, muscle strength, and TUG were not altered by vitamin D. In conclusion, oral
cholecalciferol 150,000 IU therapy administered 3-monthly had neither beneficial nor adverse effects on falls or physical function. These
data together with previous findings confirm that intermittent large doses of vitamin D are ineffective or have a deleterious effect on falls.
Thus despite adherence issues with daily vitamin D replacement, an intermittent, high-dose vitamin D regimen cannot be supported as a
strategy to reduce falls and fractures.  2012 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
S
usceptibility to falls increases with aging so that at least one-
third of older people living in the community fall each year.(1)
Falls are a major cause of injury-related hospitalization and death
in persons older than 65 years of age. Falls and fractures
represent a major public health problem in Australia, with almost
36,000 women requiring hospitalization or attendance at
hospital emergency departments annually.(2) Many studies have
demonstrated an association between vitamin D deficiency, falls,
and fracture rates in older women and men.(3–5). A previous
1-year randomized, population-based, controlled trial demon-
strated that 1000 IU of daily oral ergocalciferol treatment
reduced the risk of falling over a year by about one-third in
Western Australian women with a serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D
(25OHD) < 60 nmol/L and a history of falls in the previous year.(6)

The effect was predominantly notable in winter, the time of the
highest rate of falls and lowest 25OHD status. Thus vitamin D
insufficiency is a potentially major correctable cause of falls,
fractures, morbidity and mortality.
The importance of improved adherence with treatments to
prevent falls and fractures has received increasing attention.(7)
Because vitamin D is stored in adipose tissue it is biologically
plausible that supplements could be administered less frequent-
ly than on a daily basis to improve adherence but maintain
therapeutic effectiveness. In the present study we used
supervised oral administration to ensure high adherence.
A previous population-based randomized trial demonstrated
that
oral
4-monthly
cholecalciferol
supplementation
with
100,000 IU may prevent fractures in UK community-dwelling
individuals over the age of 65 years.(8) A 6-month study of
supplementation with 100,000 IU oral cholecalciferol every
3 months demonstrated an increase in mean serum 25OHD from
36.4  12.6 nmol/L at baseline to 124.0  27.9 nmol/L when
measured 1 week after third dose administration.(9) Based on
these data, we hypothesized that a 3-monthly 150,000 IU oral
cholecalciferol regimen would be safe, effective at achieving
appropriate target levels of 25OHD, improve treatment adher-
ence, and prevent falls and fall-related costs in unselected female
patients over the age of 70 years. In light of the evidence to
support the benefits of calcium and physical activity on fracture
prevention, advice on increasing calcium intake and physical
activity were given to all study participants. Therefore the aim of
our 9-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
was to evaluate the effects of cholecalciferol treatment and
lifestyle advice compared to lifestyle advice alone on falls, serum
25OHD
levels,
physical
function,
and
adverse
events
in
686 women aged over 70 years.
After completion of the present study, a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial of 500,000 IU oral cholecalciferol
annually in community dwelling women aged over 70 years at
higher risk of fracture reported an increased risk of falls and
fractures with vitamin D supplementation.(10) Our data are
therefore relevant to the latter findings as it is important to
determine if less frequent, higher-dose vitamin D replacement is
as equally efficacious on falls and fracture rates as lower dose,
daily oral replacement therapy.
Subjects and Methods
Participants
Women aged over 70 years living independently in the
metropolitan area of Perth, Western Australia, were recruited
to the study between February and July 2009 (mid-summer to
mid-winter) by invitation letter. Name lists of potential study
recruits were obtained from four General Practitioner (GP) clinics
and a random selection of women from the electoral roll also
received letters of invitation (n ¼ 10,500). A total of 2110 women
(657 from GP clinic name list; 1453 from electoral roll) responded
to the invitation letter, 831 attended clinic screening, and 686
women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria entered the study.
Inclusion criteria for the study included age over 70 years,
registration with a general practitioner, and likelihood, in the
investigators’ opinion, of attending four study visits over
9 months. Exclusion criteria included consumption of vitamin
D supplementation either in isolation or as part of a combination
treatment; eg, Actonel combi þD or Fosamax plus, cognitive
impairment
(Mini
Mental
State
Score
[MMSE] < 24),
and
individuals who in the investigators’ opinion would not be
suitable for the study. All procedures followed were in
accordance with institutional guidelines and were conducted
at the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in Perth. The trial ended in
April 2010 when the last subject was seen at the 9-month clinic
visit. The study was approved by the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital
Human Research Ethics Committee, and all participants provided
written
informed
consent.
The
study
was
conducted
in
compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization
Good Clinical Practices Guidelines, and registered with the
Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (Registration
number: ACTRN12609000748213).
Study design
A
9-month
randomized,
double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
prospective, parallel study was conducted. Eligible participants
were randomized to one of two treatment groups (cholecalcif-
erol or matching oral placebo). The study used a computer-
generated randomization sequence with a block size of 10 to
assign participants to either cholecalciferol therapy or placebo in
a ratio of 1:1. The randomization sequence was generated by a
pharmacist
at
Captain
Stirling
Pharmacy,
Perth,
Western
Australia, where participants were assigned to intervention
and test capsules were appropriately labeled. Because an
individual prescription was required for each subject, the
allocation to study and placebo groups and the labeling of
test capsules were completed by the pharmacist before each
subject’s baseline visit. However, more subjects allocated to the
placebo group could not fulfill the selection criteria at the
baseline visit. Consequently, there were slightly higher subject
numbers in the vitamin D group (n ¼ 353) compared to the
placebo group (n ¼ 333). Research assistants at Sir Charles
Gairdner Hospital dispensed the test capsules to participants at
clinic visits and supervised the consumption of the test capsules.
The study participants and researchers at the Sir Charles Gairdner
Hospital responsible for recruitment and assessment of out-
comes measures remained blinded to group assignment. Any
capsules that were not consumed by participants at clinic visits
were recorded.
Intervention
Subjects in the cholecalciferol group (active group) received
three capsules containing 150,000 IU of vitamin D and subjects in
the placebo group (standard practice group) received three
placebo capsules identical in appearance to the cholecalciferol
capsules at their clinic visits at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.
The cholecalciferol content of the capsule has been quantified
and verified by the Professional Compounding Chemists of
Australia (PCCA) quality control laboratory. Both groups received
written lifestyle advice on maintaining physical activity (optimal-
ly 30 minutes per day outside) and consuming 1300 mg calcium

per day using diet and/or supplements. Assessments of outcome
variables were undertaken at baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months.
Fall assessment
Falls defined as ‘‘unintentionally coming to rest on the ground,
floor, or other lower level’’ were the primary outcome of the
study. Falls ascertainment used a diary method, previously
employed to demonstrate treatment effectiveness of daily oral
ergocalciferol over 1 year in a study of women of a similar age to
those recruited in the present study.(6) The definition of a fall was
explained to subjects at the baseline visit. Participants were
instructed to record the nature, timing, and any associated
features of each fall shortly after this happened in the falls diary.
Study staff reviewed the falls diaries at 3-monthly intervals
during study visits, sought clarification from the participant if
further information was required, and determined if a fall, as
defined in the study protocol, had eventuated.
Physical function assessment
At baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months, the secondary outcome of the
study—physical function—was assessed. Hand grip strength
was measured by a handheld dynamometer and mobility
functioning was measured by the Timed Up and Go test (TUG),
which required the subjects to be timed while getting up,
walking 3 m, turning, returning to chair, and sitting down
again.(11) The interobserver coefficient of variation (CV) error was
6.7% and 5.7% for hand grip strength and TUG test in our
laboratory, respectively.
Biochemistry
Venous blood samples were collected before cholecalciferol
dosing following a 12-hour overnight fast at baseline, 3-, 6-, and
9-month clinic visits for the assessment of serum 25OHD. One
hundred-sixty samples from 40 randomly selected subjects
(20 from each group) were assayed in three analytical runs,
performed on the same day, after study completion, using sera
stored at 80 8C and measured using the automated Liaison
method (DiaSorin Inc, Stillwater, MN, USA). The minimal
detectable concentration using this method was 10 nmol/L
and the interassay coefficient of variation was 10.7% at
19 nmol/L, 8.9% at 42 nmol/L, and 5.5% at 150 nmol/L. This
method is used for routine reporting of patient samples and our
laboratory, accordingly, is accredited with the National Associa-
tion of Testing Authorities, Australia, and our 25OHD method is
enrolled and performs well in both national and international
quality-assurance programs.
Calcium intake
We assessed calcium intake at baseline and 9 months by a food
frequency questionnaire developed in a previous study(12) to
evaluate the effectiveness of the request to consume 1300 mg
calcium per day given to both groups.
Other clinical assessments
Demographic information for participants including health
history, education, past occupation, and smoking history were
collected using a questionnaire. This questionnaire includes
39 food items and utilizes the Australian Tables of Food
Composition 1990 (NUTTAB 90) database, a nutritional database
that uses chemical analysis of Australian foods. Weight and
height were measured retaining light clothing but not shoes. The
Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) test was administered at
baseline with the aim of excluding those participants who
demonstrate significant cognitive impairment.
Adverse events
Participants were asked to complete an adverse event diary.
Diary records were collated using a previously validated
method(13) that records adverse events and every clinical
physician visit. At preplanned clinic visits every 3 months, the
adverse event diary was reviewed at the study center. Adverse
events were coded using the International Classification of
Primary Care (ICPC2 Plus) system database of disease coding, a
validated method of event recording developed for use in
general practice.(14)
Sample size calculation
We anticipated the falls rate in the placebo group would be 30%
considering historical data. To detect a relative risk reduction of
0.33 with cholecalciferol therapy, using an alpha of 0.05 plus
power of 0.8, a sample size of 300 participants per treatment
group was needed. To allow for an attrition rate of 10%, the
number of subjects required to be recruited per group was at
least 330.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were reported as mean  SD and differ-
ences as mean  SEM for all variables unless otherwise stated.
The normality of continuous variables was checked by histogram
construction. Comparison of baseline characteristics was made
by Student’s t test or chi-square test. Intention-to-treat analytical
approaches were employed to quantify the effectiveness of
cholecalciferol therapy on outcome measures. The effects on the
primary outcome measure—falls—were evaluated using logis-
tic regression, adjusting for baseline age, falls in the previous
12 months, and length of follow-up. The effects on secondary
outcome measures including serum 25OHD, muscle strength,
and TUG were tested by repeated-measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA). These analyses were preplanned on the basis of clinical
considerations and previous findings. Values of p < 0.05 (two-
tailed) were regarded as statistically significant. All data were
analyzed by PASW (version 18; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
Participant characteristics
Subject disposition is presented in Figure 1. At study entry, the
mean age of participants was 76.7  4.1 years and the estimated
mean calcium intake was 864  412 mg/day. There were no
significant differences between the cholecalciferol and placebo
groups according to baseline age, anthropometry, MMSE,
calcium
intake,
and

p > 0.05). A higher percentage of participants in the cholecalcif-
erol group had experienced at least one fall in the previous
12 months compared to the placebo group (p ¼ 0.01), mainly
because there were more multi-fallers in the cholecalciferol
group (Table 1). There was no significant difference between the
cholecalciferol group and the placebo group in the number of
subjects who were lost to follow up or who discontinued the
study medication (Figure 1; all p > 0.05). Because all study
participants consumed test capsules at each clinic visit,
adherence rates for those who remained active in the trial
was 100%.
Effects on falls
During the 9 months study period, 102 (28.9%) subjects in the
cholecalciferol group and 89 (26.7%) subjects in the placebo
group experienced at least one fall and 26 (7.4%) subjects in the
cholecalciferol group and 16 (4.8%) subjects in the placebo
group experienced more than one fall (Fig. 2). The odds ratio for
the cholecalciferol group compared with the placebo group was
1.11 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80–1.56) for experiencing at
least one fall and 1.58 (95% CI, 0.83–2.99) for multiple falls. The
higher percentage of participants recruited to the cholecalciferol
group who experienced at least one fall in the previous
12 months compared to the placebo group, may have

predisposed the cholecalciferol group to the slightly higher falls
risk. However, adjusting for this and other potential baseline
confounding variables did not alter the outcome (Fig. 2).
Effects on physical performance and calcium intake
Table 2 shows that compared to baseline, hand grip strength
increased in the placebo group at 3 months, but decreased in
both groups at 9 months. TUG fell in both groups at 3 and
6 months and in the placebo group at 9 months. However, there
were no significant differences between the two treatment
groups in the change of these two physical performance
measurements at each time point (Table 2). There were no
significant changes in calcium intakes from baseline to 9 months
in both treatment groups (Table 2).
Effects on vitamin D status
In the 40 randomly selected subjects at baseline the mean serum
25OHD concentration was 65.8  22.7 nmol/L, and there was no
significant difference between the two groups. At 3, 6, and
9 months, the vitamin D group had significantly higher serum
25OHD levels compared to the placebo group (Table 3). Serum
25OHD levels increased significantly in the vitamin D group
between baseline, 3 and 9 months and decreased significantly in
the placebo group between baseline, 3 and 6 months (Table 3).
Overall the proportion of participants in the placebo group with
25OHD above 75 nmol/L fell from 30% at baseline to 20% at
9 months while the proportion participants in the vitamin D
group with 25OHD over 75 nmol/L rose from 35% at baseline to
40% at 9 months.
Adverse events
During the study period, there were no significant differences
between the vitamin D and the placebo groups in the rate of
incident cancer (vitamin D 5.4%, placebo 4.5%, p ¼ 0.73), type 2
diabetes (vitamin D 0.3%, placebo 0.5%, p ¼ 0.36), stroke (vitamin
D 0.8%, placebo 0.6%, p ¼ 1.00), ischemic heart disease (vitamin
D 0.6%, placebo 1.2%, p ¼ 0.44), or fracture (vitamin D 2.8%,
placebo 3.0%, p ¼ 1.00).
Discussion
The multiple strengths of our study include the number of
participants, the randomization process, the placebo control, the
supervised administration of treatment, the high compliance,
and the blinding of treatment allocation. Despite these
strengths,
vitamin
D
administered
as
oral
cholecalciferol
150,000 IU every 3 months had no beneficial or adverse effect
on falls rates in older females living independently. This lack of
efficacy on balance, and associated falling, is supported by the
lack of effect on hand grip strength and the TUG test.
As reported in the methods section the planned study had a
power of 0.8, to show a 33% reduction in falls in the active
compared to the placebo groups specified to be clinically
significant. In our study, 686 individuals were recruited with a 7%
loss to follow up and only a 2.6% lack of adherence to the
intervention due to the supervised administration of the vitamin

D and placebo. The falls rate was slightly lower than anticipated
at 26.7%.
Recalculation
of the
power using these data
demonstrated a power of 0.8 to detect a 34% reduction in
falls. However, the falls rate in the active treatment group was
higher than in the placebo group, suggesting that there was no
beneficial effect and arguing against a Type 2 error.
A review of previous studies is instructive regarding the
frequency and dosage of cholecalciferol chosen in our study and
the lack of efficacy demonstrated. The data in this study of 150,000
IU of cholecalciferol administered every 3 months (daily average
intake 1667 IU) can be compared to previous studies that
prescribed up to 1000 IU per day of vitamin D(15) and three studies
using higher-dose, intermittent vitamin D therapy.(8,10,16) The
majority of studies of daily vitamin D replacement have
demonstrated beneficial effects on falls with an approximately
20% to 30% reduction in event rates(6,15) and, with calcium, a
reduction in fractures of about 26%.(17). However, three studies of
intermittent high-dose vitamin D that have been published have
variable results depending on the dose.(8,10,16) A fracture endpoint
study of oral cholecalciferol 100,000 IU every 4 months for 5 years
in 2500 community-dwelling British men and women aged 65 to
85 years demonstrated a 22% reduction of first fracture events and
33% reduction in first hip, wrist, or vertebral fractures.(8) Falls rates
were not measured in this study.(8) A study of 9000 British
community-dwelling men and women randomized to 300,000 IU
of intramuscular ergocalciferol or placebo annually for 3 years
reported an increased risk of hip fractures but not total fracture in
women treated with ergocalciferol.(16) Falls data were collected
yearly by recall but no effect of vitamin D on falls was reported.(16)
Finally, a study of 2200 community-dwelling women aged over
70 years at high risk of fracture demonstrated that 500,000 IU of
cholecalciferol administered as an annual oral dose was associated
with a 26% increased risk of fracture and a 15% increased risk of
falling compared to placebo.(10) The majority of the deleterious
effects in the latter study occurred in the first 3 months when
25OHD levels were highest.(10) In this context, the findings of our
current study using 150,000 IU of cholecalciferol replacement
every 3 months showing no overall beneficial or adverse effect are
consistent with the concept that doses of vitamin D replacement
over 100,000 IU should be considered ineffective or, at higher
dose, deleterious.
The mechanism of the deleterious effect of high-dose vitamin
D replacement remains uncertain. However, the frequency of
hormone administration is recognized to modulate biological
effects. For example, parathyroid hormone when given as an
intermittent daily dose has anabolic skeletal effects,(18) but when
given in a continuous fashion, the opposing catabolic skeletal
effect is seen.(19) It is therefore, hypothesized that infrequent
high-dose administration of cholecalciferol could negate any
beneficial effect on muscle metabolism due to differential effects
on gene regulation.
Weaknesses of our study include; first, the suboptimal dietary
calcium intake of the participants who did not comply with the
request to increase calcium intake to 1300 mg per day. Because
the published literature demonstrates the benefit of vitamin D
in combination with calcium in the prevention of falls and
fractures,(17) calcium supplementation should be added to
vitamin D supplementation in future randomized controlled
trials. Second, a higher percentage of participants in the
cholecalciferol group had experienced at least one fall in the
previous 12 months compared to the placebo group. However,
adjustment for this factor in the logistic regression analysis did
not alter the study outcome. Third, the effectiveness of
cholecalciferol replacement in our study may have been
negated by the high mean baseline serum 25OHD values of
65.8 nmol/L. Fourth, at the 9-month study visit, 60% of
participants in the vitamin D group had a 25OHD nadir value
less than 75 nmol/L, an optimal threshold level considered by
some to prevent falls and fractures. However, a previous study,
used as one basis for our study, reported that 100,000 IU oral
cholecalciferol every 3 months resulted in a serum 25OHD
levels of 124.0  27.9 nmol/L 1 week after the third dose
administration.(9) Furthermore, a previous published study
demonstrated protection against falls risk (odds ratio 0.61) with
a serum 25OHD level of 60  14 nmol/L.(6) Fifth, our study used
a diary method to collect falls events that may have missed or
misclassified some falls compared to more intensive methods.
This is, however, unlikely because the event rates reported by
more intensive ascertainment of falls were no different from
that of the present study. Furthermore, the main outcome, a
comparison of fall frequency in the two groups, would not be
affected by any potential underestimation of event rates
equally in both groups. Finally, more than 96% of the study
subjects were Caucasian community-dwelling older women.
Therefore, the interpretation of these findings is limited to this
population.
In conclusion, these data and other studies of high dose
intermittent vitamin D therapy, support the concept that dosing
above 100,000 IU every 3 to 4 months is ineffective or
deleterious. Thus, intermittent high dose vitamin D supplemen-
tation with or without daily oral calcium replacement cannot be
currently advocated as an effective strategy to reduce falls and
fractures, despite previously recognized adherence problems
with daily regimens.
