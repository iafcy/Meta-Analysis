Objective: To determine whether vitamin D supplemen-
tation decreases the incidence of hip fractures and other 
peripheral bone fractures. 
Design: Prospective, double-blind trial. 
Setting: Community setting (Amsterdam and surround-
ing area). 
Patients: 2578 persons (1916 women, 662 men) 70 years 
of age and older (mean age ± SDf 80 ± 6 years) living 
independently, in apartments for elderly persons, or in 
homes for elderly persons. 
Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned to 
receive either vitamin D3, 400 IU in one tablet daily, or 
placebo for a maximum of 3.5 years. 
Measurements: Dietary calcium intake and serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] were estimated in a subset of 
participants. During follow-up, attention was concen-
trated on hip fractures and other peripheral fractures. The 
maximal follow-up period was 4 years. The results were 
evaluated by survival analysis. 
Results: Mean dietary calcium intake from dairy prod-
ucts was 868 mg/d. Mean serum 25(OH)D concentration in 
the third year of the study was 23 nmol/L in the placebo 
group and 60 nmol/L in the vitamin D group. Median 
follow-up was 3.5 years, and total follow-up was 8450 
patient-years. During follow-up, 306 persons in the pla-
cebo group and 282 persons in the vitamin D group died 
(P = 0.20). Hip fractures occurred in 48 persons in the 
placebo group and 58 persons in the vitamin D group (P = 
0.39, intention-to-treat analysis). Other peripheral frac-
tures occurred in 74 persons in the placebo group and 77 
persons in the vitamin D group (P = 0.86). 
Conclusion: Our results do not show a decrease in the 
incidence of hip fractures and other peripheral fractures in 
Dutch elderly persons after vitamin D supplementation. 
V
itamin D deficiency is common in elderly per-
sons, especially those with hip fracture (1, 2). 
It is caused by low exposure to sunshine, decreased 
synthesis of vitamin D3 in the aging skin, and a diet 
low in vitamin D (3, 4). The mean vitamin D intake 
in elderly persons in the Netherlands is about 100 
IU/d, half that of elderly persons in the United 
States (5). Most of this vitamin D comes from mar-
garine, which is the only vitamin D-supplemented 
food in the Netherlands (3 IU/g). In vitamin D 
deficiency, the low serum concentration of 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] leads to a low 1,25-dihy-
droxyvitamin D [l,25(OH)2D] concentration and then 
to a higher serum parathyroid hormone concentra-
tion, especially in the winter (6-10). Histologically, 
the increased parathyroid activity is associated with 
high bone turnover, leading to cortical bone loss 
and low density bone (5, 11), which may lead to hip 
fracture. 
We previously studied the effects of vitamin D 
supplementation in residents of a home for the 
elderly and residents of a nursing home (10). Vita-
min D3, 400 IU/d, led to an adequate increase of 
the serum 25(OH)D concentration, to a small but 
significant increase of the serum l,25(OH)2D con-
centration, and to a decrease of the serum concen-
tration of intact parathyroid hormone. It was re-
cently observed (12, 13) that bone mineral density 
at the hip is positively related to serum 25(OH)D 
concentration in postmenopausal and elderly women. 
Therefore, it might be expected that vitamin D sup-
plementation would increase bone mineral density 
in elderly persons deficient in vitamin D. In line 
with this expectation, it was shown that vitamin D 
supplementation prevented bone loss from the spine 
during the winter in postmenopausal women (14). 
These results suggest that vitamin D supplemen-
tation may reduce the incidence of hip fractures, 
because bone strength shows a strong correlation 
with bone mineral density (15). However, increasing 
bone mineral density through a therapeutic inter-
vention does not necessarily lead to increased bone 
strength, as has been shown with sodium fluoride 
(16). Bone structure and bone quality are also de-
terminants of bone strength (17), and falls are a risk 
factor for hip fractures (18). Therefore, hip fracture

should be the outcome criterion in studies on the 
effect of vitamin D supplementation. Intervention 
studies on the prevention of osteoporotic fractures 
necessitate large numbers of patients, because the 
outcome has an annual incidence of 0.5% to 4% in 
the elderly population (19). We report the results of 
a large-scale, prospective study on the effect of vi-
tamin D supplementation on the incidence of hip 
and other osteoporotic fractures. 
Methods 
Participants 
The study included 2578 persons (1916 women and 
662 men) 70 years of age and older (mean age ± 
SD, 80 ± 6 years; range, 70 to 97 years). Partici-
pants were recruited from general practitioners, 
from apartment houses for elderly persons, and 
from homes for elderly persons in Amsterdam and 
its vicinity. Persons recruited from practitioners 
were living independently; those recruited from 
apartment houses and homes were receiving some 
care, but less than they would have received in a 
nursing home. Participants had to be reasonably 
healthy and able to give informed consent. Persons 
with a history of hip fracture or total hip arthro-
plasty, known hypercalcemia, sarcoidosis, or recent 
urolithiasis (< 5 years earlier) were excluded. Pa-
tients who had diseases or who used medications 
that influence bone metabolism (such as thyroid 
disease or glucocorticoid medication) were not ex-
cluded. The spontaneous use of vitamin D supple-
ments and multivitamins was discouraged, but the 
prescription practices of the general practitioners 
were not altered. All vitamin use was carefully doc-
umented. The study was approved by the Ethical 
Review Board of the Vrije Universiteit Hospital, 
and all participants gave informed consent. 
Study Design 
After checking the inclusion and exclusion crite-
ria and obtaining informed consent, the participants 
were randomly assigned to receive either active 
treatment with vitamin D3 or placebo. The study 
was double-blind, and randomization was done in 
blocks of 10 per general practice, apartment house, 
or home. Randomization lists were made using a 
computerized random-number generator. Lists in 
sealed envelopes were sent to the hospital pharmacy 
for assignment. Each participant took either one 
tablet per day that contained vitamin D3, 400 IU, or 
one placebo tablet per day that was identical in 
appearance and taste to the vitamin tablet. After 
enrollment, the participants received the first con-
tainer of tablets (210 tablets). The container was 
replaced every 6 months with a full container. All 
participants were also advised in writing to consume 
at least three servings of dairy products per day (for 
example, 1 glass of milk, 1 cup of yogurt, and 1 slice 
of cheese) to ensure a calcium intake of at least 800 
to 1000 mg/d. 
The study was started in August 1988. The last 
participant was enrolled in December 1990, and all 
participants had stopped using study medication by 
December 1993. The follow-up period had been 
planned to last no more than 3 years, but because 
the number of hip fractures during the study was 
lower than expected, a 6-month extension was 
planned. The study participants thus received med-
ication for 3 to 3.5 years; those who received it for 
3.5 years were those who consented to the 6-month 
extension. Total follow-up was to a maximum of 4 
years. 
Data collected at baseline included an outdoor 
activity score (1 = going outdoors less than once a 
week; 2 = going outdoors 1 or 2 times per week; 
and 3 = going outdoors 3 times per week or more) 
and a score for sunshine exposure (when outside: 
1 = in the shade as much as possible; 2 = some-
times in sunshine; 3 = much exposure to sunshine). 
These scores show a positive relation with serum 
25(OH)D concentration (3). Mobility was estimated 
by a walking score that ranged from 1 (unable to 
walk) to 5 (walks independently a fair distance on 
any surface) (20). The dietary calcium intake from 
dairy products was estimated in a subset of 348 
women by using a questionnaire, as described pre-
viously (21). 
The participants were evaluated annually with a 
questionnaire on hip fractures, other peripheral 
fractures, outdoor score, sunshine exposure score, 
use of vitamin supplements, and walking score. 
Each general practitioner or caretaker was asked to 
immediately report change of address, hip fracture, 
or death. Hip fracture and death were verified by 
the general practitioner. All participants were fol-
lowed for the maximal period of 4 years if possible, 
even if they had stopped using the trial medication, 
had sustained a fracture, or had moved to another 
city. To investigate possible selection bias, 267 po-
tential participants in a home for the elderly and its 
adjunct apartments (all residents of the institution) 
were studied for baseline characteristics, including 
age, sex, sunshine exposure score, outdoor score, 
walking score, and reasons for nonparticipation. 
Compliance was checked when the tablet con-
tainers were replaced (every 6 months), by question-
naire (every year), and by measurement of the serum 
25(OH)D concentration. Serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tion was measured at baseline and after 1 year in 
270 persons who participated in a substudy investi-
gating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on

bone mineral density and bone turnover variables. 
This substudy included a nonrandom sample of par-
ticipants from several apartment houses and homes 
for the elderly and is described in detail elsewhere 
(21). In the same substudy, dietary calcium intake 
from dairy products was assessed. Serum 25(OH)D 
concentration was also estimated during the third 
year of the study in February and March in a ran-
dom sample of 96 participants drawn from the re-
maining study population. These participants re-
ceived a letter giving them an appointment within 
10 days; the blood samples were drawn at home. 
Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured by 
competitive protein binding assay after being puri-
fied by gradient high-pressure liquid chromatogra-
phy. The intra- and interassay coefficients of varia-
tion were 5% and 6%, respectively (22). 
Statistical Analysis 
Baseline data of the vitamin D group and the 
placebo group were compared using Mests (age, 
calcium intake), chi-square tests (sex, residence), 
and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (scores). The serum 
25(OH)D concentrations of both groups were com-
pared using /-tests. 
Data on fractures and mortality were analyzed by 
survival analysis using log-rank tests, Cox propor-
tional hazards regression, and hazard rate ratios

(23). Hip fractures are presented using the Kaplan-
Meier method. All participants were kept in the 
study as long as possible. The data were analyzed in 
two ways. The intention-to-treat analysis included 
all randomly assigned participants for either the 
total follow-up period or until fracture, death, or 
loss to follow-up. The active treatment analysis in-
cluded the participants as long as they stated that 
they were using the trial medication. Thus, the par-
ticipants were included in the active treatment anal-
ysis until they stopped using the trial medication, 
regardless of whether a fracture occurred after they 
had stopped. Age, sex, and residence were added in 
both analyses as covariates to the Cox regression 
model. Because outdoor score, sunshine score, and 
walking score were interrelated (correlation coeffi-
cients ranging from 0.21 to 0.59) and were likely to 
indicate "general health" or "mobility," they were 
averaged over the years and added up to a sum 
score. For this purpose, the walking score was sim-
plified (1, 2, or 3 = 1; 4 = 2; 5 = 3), because the 
lower walking scores applied to a few participants 
only. The resulting total score, ranging from 3 to 9, 
was entered as a covariate in the model. The level 
of compliance (weekly intake as reported on the 
questionnaire) was also added as a covariate to the 
active treatment analysis. Separate survival analyses 
were done for hip fractures and other peripheral 
fractures. In the analysis for hip fractures, we used 
the time to the first hip fracture, regardless of other 
peripheral fractures. In the analysis for other pe-
ripheral fractures, we used the time to the first 
peripheral fracture, regardless of hip fractures. The 
analyses were repeated after we excluded partici-
pants who used vitamin D or multivitamin supple-
ments other than the trial medication. 
Results 
Baseline data for the participants are presented 
in Table 1. There were no important differences in 
baseline characteristics between the groups. A study 
of nonparticipation in 267 potential participants 
from one institution showed that 30 potential par-
ticipants had had to be excluded on the basis of 
exclusion criteria. Of the remaining 237 persons, 54 
(23%) consented to participate. The mean ages of 
the 54 participants (83.2 years) and the 183 nonpar-
ticipants (83.0 years) did not differ, nor did the sex 
ratios of the two groups. The outdoor, sunshine, 
and walking scores tended to be lower in the non-
participants than in the participants. For example, 
the walking score was lower than 4 in 11% of the 
participants and 17% of the nonparticipants. Rea-
sons for not giving consent were primarily "infor-

mation not received or forgotten," "other commit-

At the start of the study, 133 participants were 
taking a vitamin or multivitamin preparation that 
usually contained 90 to 400 IU of vitamin D. During 
the study, 73 participants (37 in the placebo group 
and 36 in the vitamin D group) were found to be 
taking a vitamin or multivitamin supplement that 
contained vitamin D at two or more follow-up visits. 
Data on mortality, cessation of trial medication, 
loss to follow-up, and active treatment at 3 years 
after randomization are presented in Table 2. The 
number of participants who died or stopped using 
the trial medication was higher (although not sig-
nificantly higher) in the placebo group than in the 
vitamin D group. It can be seen that 1626 partici-
pants, or 63% of the 2578 participants at the start 
of the study, completed 3 years of the study. After 
3 years, the 1313 participants who had started early 
within the inclusion period were asked to continue, 
and 1194 of these participants consented to enter 
the 6-month extension period. This group was, on 
average, 1 year younger than the remaining study 
sample. The maximal follow-up period was 4 years 
(6 months after medication was stopped). The me-
dian duration of follow-up was 3.5 years, and the 
total follow-up time was 8450 patient-years. During 
the total follow-up period, 306 participants in the 
placebo group and 282 participants in the vitamin D 
group died (P = 0.20 by survival analysis). 
Compliance was considered to be adequate if the 
participants reported on the questionnaire that they 
took the tablets 5 or more days per week. This 
occurred in 85% of the participants; compliance was 
similar in both groups. The serum 25(OH)D con-
centrations measured at baseline and after 1 year of 
treatment in a sample of 270 residents of apartment 
houses or homes for the elderly and those measured 
in 96 randomly selected participants in the third 
year of our study are shown in Table 3. The overlap 
in the distribution of concentrations between partic-
ipants receiving placebo and participants receiving 
vitamin D was small. The contrast in serum 25(OH)D 
concentrations between the placebo group and the 
vitamin D group was greater in institutionalized than 
in independent elderly persons. 
During the total follow-up period, 111 hip frac-
tures occurred in 106 participants; 5 participants 
had a hip fracture on each side. There were 157 
other peripheral fractures in 151 participants. 
Eleven participants sustained both a hip fracture 
and another fracture. The fracture data are pre-
sented in Table 4; the hip fracture data are shown 
in Figure 1. The vitamin D group had slightly more 
hip fractures than the placebo group, but the dif-
ference was not statistically significant. This is ap-
parent in the Kaplan-Meier curve in the top panel 
of Figure 1. The unadjusted hazard rate ratio for 
hip fractures (vitamin D compared with placebo) 
according to the intention-to-treat analysis was 1.18 
(95% CI, 0.81 to 1.71). When the residents of apart-
ment houses and homes for elderly were analyzed 
as a separate subgroup, 36 hip fractures occurred in 
the placebo group, and 49 hip fractures occurred in 
the vitamin D group (hazard rate ratio according to 
intention-to-treat analysis, 1.3 [CI, 0.84 to 2.0]). 
When participants 80 years of age and older were 
analyzed as a separate subgroup, the results were 
similar (hazard rate ratio, 1.13 [CI, 0.70 to 1.80]). 
Including age, sex, residence, and sum score (out-
door, sunshine, and walking scores) as covariates 
did not change the results. Excluding persons who 
regularly used vitamin or multivitamin supplements 
did not change the results. The unadjusted hazard 
rate ratio for other peripheral fractures (vitamin D 
compared with placebo) was 1.03 (CI, 0.75 to 1.40).

Data on the active treatment analysis, in which 
participants were included as long as they used the 
trial medication, are shown in the bottom panel of 
Figure 1. This figure shows that the curves of the 
placebo group and the vitamin D group are similar. 
The unadjusted hazard rate ratio for hip fractures 
(vitamin D compared with placebo) according to 
the active treatment analysis was 1.10 (CI, 0.71 to 
1.70). For other peripheral fractures, it was 1.02 
(CI, 0.73 to 1.40). The inclusion of age, sex, resi-
dence, sum score, and compliance as covariates did 
not change the results. 
Discussion 
Vitamin D supplementation did not decrease the 
incidence of hip fractures in our study population. 
The hypothesis of a protective effect of vitamin D 
had been based on previous studies done in the 
Netherlands (10, 24), which showed that vitamin D 
supplementation in elderly persons deficient in vita-
min D led to an adequate improvement of vitamin 
D status, as determined by significant increases of 
the serum 25(OH)D and l,25(OH)2D concentra-
tions and a decrease of the serum parathyroid hor-
mone concentration. In contrast, vitamin D supple-
mentation in nursing home residents in the United 
States who were replete with vitamin D (mean se-
rum 25(OH)D concentration > 40 nmol/L) did not 
significantly decrease the parathyroid hormone con-
centration (25). A positive effect of vitamin D was 
also suggested by the results of the substudy done in 
248 women from the present study (13). This sub-
study showed that bone mineral density in the hip 
at baseline correlated positively with the serum 
25(OH)D concentration below a threshold level [se-
rum 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L]. After 2 years of vita-
min D supplementation, the bone mineral density of 
the femoral neck had increased 2.3% in the vitamin 
D group compared with the placebo group (21). 
According to Cummings and coworkers (26), a de-
crease of 1 standard deviation in bone mineral den-
sity of the hip increases hip fracture risk by a factor 
(risk ratio) of 2.6. When these data are combined, it 
can be calculated that a 2.3% increase in bone 
mineral density of the femoral neck might result in 
a decrease in hip fracture incidence of about 15% 
and a risk ratio of 0.85 (27). We could have missed 
such a decrease because it is within the 95% CIs of 
the observed hazard rate ratio. The power of our 
study was such that a decrease in the hip fracture 
incidence of 20% or more could have been shown. 
Our study may also have underestimated the ef-
fect of vitamin D supplementation in other ways. 
The 248 participants who had repeated bone min-
eral density measurements were women living in 
apartment houses and homes for the elderly. This 
sample was not random and did not contain men or 
elderly persons living independently. Vitamin D 
supplementation may have less effect in elderly per-
sons living independently, because these persons are 
younger and have higher serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations than residents of homes for the elderly. The 
visible effect of vitamin D supplementation in our 
study may also have been decreased by the 73 par-
ticipants who regularly used vitamin or multivitamin 
supplements. However, excluding these participants 
did not change our results. We chose to include 
these persons and to do the additional analysis be-
cause it is difficult to completely eliminate the use 
of vitamin supplements. 
The effect of vitamin D supplementation by in-
tramuscular injection has been studied in Finland 
(28). A decrease in the incidence of upper limb 
fractures was found, in contrast to our results. How-
ever, the participants in the Finnish study were all 
residents of nursing homes. 
The effect of vitamin D, 800 IU/d, and calcium, 
1200 mg/d, compared with double placebo was stud-
ied in 3270 elderly women in Lyon, France, by 
Chapuy and colleagues (29). These investigators ob-
served a 25% decrease (intention-to-treat analysis) 
in the incidence of hip fractures and other periph-
eral fractures. Important differences between our 
study conditions and those of Chapuy and col-
leagues include a considerably lower dietary calcium 
intake in France than in the Netherlands and the 
use of a calcium supplement in the French study. 
The participants in the French study were an aver-
age of 3 years older (at baseline) than our partici-
pants, were all women, and were all residents of 
nursing homes. 
Hip fracture incidence was higher in the French 
study than in our study. The incidence in our study 
was 25 per 1000 participants per year in women 
living in homes for the elderly and 29 per 1000 
participants per year in women older than 85 years

of age. In the French prevention study, the inci-
dence was 40 per 1000 participants per year in 
women older than 85 years of age (29). The vitamin 
D dosage in the French study was higher (800 IU/d) 
than in our study. However, as we have shown 
previously (10), the difference between the effects of 
400 and 800 IU of vitamin D3 per day is almost 
negligible. Serum 25(OH)D concentration in the 
French study was similar to that in ours, but the 
measurement technique used by Chapuy and col-
leagues was different from the one we used. Cross-
calibration of the assays suggests that the partici-
pants in the French study had greater vitamin D 
deficiencies than our participants (30). The decrease 
in serum parathyroid hormone concentration in a 
sample of the French study was about 50% after 
calcium and vitamin D treatment (29), whereas this 
concentration decreased slightly more than 15% in 
a nonrandom sample from our study after vitamin 
D supplementation (21). The difference in bone 
mineral density of the hip between the treatment 
group and the control group was more than 6% in 
the French study and only 2.3% in a nonrandom 
sample from our study (21). In sum, the changes in 
parathyroid activity and bone mineral density of the 
hip indicate that a larger treatment effect occurred 
in the French study. 
Participants in our study may have been more 
active than the average, because the incidence of 
fractures in our study was lower than expected. 
About 60% of the more than 60 homes for the 
elderly in Amsterdam participated in our study, but 
the percentage of persons in each home who par-
ticipated varied from 5% to 30%. We gained the 
impression that frailer elderly persons more often 
refrained from participation; this was also suggested 
by the results of our small nonparticipation study. 
However, analysis of the older and less active sub-

group did not show a trend toward a protective 
effect of vitamin D supplementation. 
Our results do not show that vitamin D supple-
mentation in elderly persons in the Netherlands de-
creases the incidence of hip fractures and other 
peripheral fractures. The data suggest that other 
risk factors are more important in our study popu-
lation. Nevertheless, a positive effect of vitamin D 
supplementation is suggested by the small increase 
in bone mineral density of the femoral neck ob-
served in a sample of this study (21). The effect of 
vitamin D supplementation might be greater when a 
calcium supplement is also used, as in the French 
study (29). The same results might not be found in 
the Netherlands, however, where dietary calcium 
intake is much higher than in France. A major 
difference between our study and the two previous 
studies in which vitamin D supplementation ap-
peared to be effective (28, 29) may be the health 
status of the participants, which was generally better 
in our study. It may be that the effect of vitamin D 
supplementation on the incidence of fractures may 
only be apparent in an older, frailer population than 
ours. If so, vitamin D supplementation might there-
fore be considered primarily for frail elderly persons 
who do not go outdoors in the sunshine.
