elderly men and women—a population-based, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
H. Smith, F. Anderson1, H. Raphael, P. Maslin, S. Crozier2 and C. Cooper2
Objectives. Low trauma fractures in older people incur enormous physical, social and economic costs. Previous research indicates that an
annual intramuscular injection of vitamin D may reduce fracture rates in this group. This strategy requires validation in a population setting.
Methods. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 300 000 IU intramuscular (i.m.) vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) injection or
matching placebo every autumn over 3 years. 9440 people (4354 men and 5086 women) aged 75 yrs and over were recruited from general
practice registers in Wessex, England. Primary outcome measure was all non-vertebral fracture. Secondary outcomes were hip and wrist
fractures, and all falls.
Results. 585 subjects had incident non-spine fractures (hip 110, wrist 116, ankle 37). Hazard ratios (HRs) for fracture in the vitamin D group
were: 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.28, P ¼ 0.29] for any first fracture, 1.49 (95% CI 1.02–2.18, P ¼ 0.04) for hip and 1.22 (95%
CI 0.85–1.76, P ¼ 0.28) for wrist. There was no effect on falls: HR 0.98 (0.93–1.04). No protective effect was observed in any subgroup when
the cohort was stratified by sex, age, previous fracture or mobility.
Conclusions. An annual i.m. injection of 300 000 IU vitamin D2 is not effective in preventing non-vertebral fractures among elderly men and
women resident in the general population.

Introduction
Osteoporotic fractures are a major public health problem, and
their incidence is projected to increase steeply worldwide [1].
The social and economic costs associated with osteoporotic
fractures are very great [2], and reducing this burden is widely
seen as a health care policy imperative. Vitamin D deficiency is
common in elderly people, especially those with hip fracture, and
Vitamin D supplementation, if effective, might provide a feasible
and relatively cost-effective primary preventive measure against
fracture among older men and women. Previous studies of vitamin
D supplementation among older people in western populations
have produced inconsistent results. When combined with calcium
in daily oral formulations, the intervention has been shown to
reduce the incidence of osteoporotic fractures among elderly
nursing home residents [3]; when administered orally and without
calcium supplementation, fracture prevention has been more
difficult to demonstrate [4–6]. Vitamin D may also be adminis-
tered by intramuscular (i.m.) injection, and a single non-
randomized trial of men and women aged 85 yrs and over
administered an annual i.m. injection of ergocalciferol vitamin D2
(150 000–300 000 IU) resulted in a significant reduction in the
incidence of all fractures over a 5-yr period, when compared with
a control series [7]. We report the results of a randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial of 300 000 IU i.m. ergocalciferol
injection or matching placebo on fracture rates among 9440 men
and women aged 75 yrs and over, resident in the general
population.
Methods
Study design
The study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial of 300 000 IU ergocalciferol (Evans Medical Ltd/Celltech
Ltd, UK) by i.m. injection in men and women aged over 75 yrs
recruited from the practice registers of 111 general practices
included in the Wessex Primary Care Research Network (WReN)
in central Southern England [8]. Previous studies have demon-
strated that the age, gender and socioeconomic profile of practices
enrolled within this network are representative of England and
Wales as a whole [9]. Institutional Review Board approval for the
study was obtained from the South West Multi-centre Research
Ethics Committee (MREC/98/6/51).
Recruitment and randomization
The influenza immunization programme in England and Wales
offers immunization annually to all adults over 65 yrs of age; we
utilized this framework to select our study sample on the principle
that, were the intervention to prove effective, this would provide
a cost-effective way of implementing the intervention as a public
health measure. Men and women aged over 75 yrs who did not
meet any of the study exclusion criteria (current cancer or
any history of treated osteoporosis, bilateral total hip replace-
ment, renal failure, renal stones, hypercalcaemia or sarcoidosis)
were
identified
from the
age–sex
registers
of
participating
practices. An information leaflet about the study with a covering
letter from their practice was sent to potential participants. Those
interested in participating were asked to return a form giving
details of any vitamin D supplementation they took already.
People taking 400 IU or more daily were excluded from
the study. The remainder were invited to an appointment with
the
practice
nurse,
who
confirmed
their
understanding
of
the study, checked for exclusion criteria not recorded in existing
medical
records
and
obtained
written
informed
consent.
A questionnaire ascertained details of previous fractures, current
mobility and accommodation. The numbers of subjects invited
and randomized are shown in Fig. 1.

Intervention
Subjects were randomized at an individual level to either the
intervention or control group. Randomization was balanced in
each of the 111 practice sites by randomizing within blocks at each
practice. Each participating practice was sent mixed boxes
containing previously randomized, numbered ampoules of either
vitamin D or placebo, which were identical in visual appearance
and consistency. As each subject consented to participate in the
trial, they were allocated consecutive ampoules. The number of
the ampoule was then linked to the patient’s name and phoned to
a central location. This study number remained with the subject
for the duration of the trial. The trial injection was then given i.m.
into the buttock or leg. Packing and labelling were carried out by
an external contractor; allocation was concealed from investiga-
tors, practice nurses and subjects. After completion of the
recruitment phase, all study documentation was checked at each
practice by the trial manager (HMR) and, together with any
unused ampoules, returned to the central study office.
Follow-up
Active or placebo injections were administered at annual intervals
and concealed in the same way as the first injection. Information
on falls, current mobility and residential status was obtained at
annual review (12, 24 and 36 months) by the practice nurse and on
incident fractures by postal questionnaire at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and
36 months. Fracture history on the questionnaire was corrobo-
rated at the annual visits to the practice nurse, as well as against
hospital and general practice records. Non-responders to the
‘interval’ questionnaires were sent one reminder after 4 weeks and
were contacted by telephone after a further 2 weeks if necessary.
Participants continued their usual drug treatment and any new
drugs that
were advised
during routine
care. Recruitment
commenced in autumn 1998, and follow-up was completed in
autumn 2002.
Outcome ascertainment
The principal outcome of the trial was all non-vertebral fractures.
Secondary outcomes were fractures of the hip or wrist, and the
frequency of falls. Study events were self-reported by subjects at
6-monthly intervals using the fracture questionnaire validated in
the European Prospective Osteoporosis Study [10]. This inquires
about fractures over the intervening 6 months, and is accom-
panied by a mannequin on which the fracture site is indicated.
Any fracture reported by study participants was confirmed from
hospital and practice records. Separately, practices notified any

reported fracture in their patients directly to the trial office.
A fracture was treated as confirmed if it met two of the three
criteria: report by study subject; report by practice; and confirma-
tion from hospital records. Fracture sites were coded using the
fracture classification adopted by the International Classification
of Diseases, 9th Revision. A history of falls during the preceding
6-month period was also obtained from the questionnaire.
An interviewer-administered questionnaire was performed in a
randomly selected subset of 200 trial participants, which inquired
about previous fracture history, dietary calcium intake, physical
activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, medical and
drug history and reproductive variables in women.
Statistical analyses
An intention-to-treat analysis was performed, which included all
participants randomized. We compared crude incidence rates for
fracture amongst those treated with vitamin D and placebo; we
then estimated hazard ratios (HRs) using Cox regression in Stata
7.0, after adjustment for age. Data were censored at the time-point
at which a fracture was reported, the most recent questionnaire
was completed, or at the completion of study follow-up. Subjects
who did not return a questionnaire at one time-point, but then
returned a later questionnaire continued to contribute to earlier
follow-up only. The study had 80% power to detect a difference in
fracture rate of 30% (3.3% or lower, from a baseline of 4.7% [11])
at the 5% significance level, with 5000 patients in each arm. This
allowed for a 20% dropout rate.
Calcium biochemistry
In a pilot of 43 subjects eligible to enter the trial (30 treated,
13 placebo), we collected blood samples for measurement of serum
25-hydroxyvitamin
D
(25-OHD),
(1,25)-dihydroxyvitamin
D
(1,25-DHD) and plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentra-
tions. Samples were collected at baseline then at 1, 4, 8, 12, 13 and
16 months, covering two treatment cycles. Blood was taken
without haemostasis into glass tubes containing coagulant and
protease inhibitor, and then separated in a refrigerated centrifuge.
Serum was transferred to cryotubes and frozen at 708C until
analysed in one batch at the end of the collection period.
1,25-DHD was assayed by RIA after immunoextraction (IDS
Limited, Tyne & Wear, UK), 25-OHD by RIA (Nicholls
Diagnostics,
CA,
USA).
PTH
was
measured
on
a
DPC
Immulyte analyser. Biochemical studies were performed in a 2:1
ratio of treated:placebo subjects to enhance precision in the
treated group; the subjects comprised consecutive eligible atten-
dees at a single practice. Paired and non-paired t-tests (as
applicable) and ANOVA were used to assess differences between
groups of different time-points and changes from baseline values.
Results
The 111 participating general practices invited 13 487 potential
participants over a 3-yr period. Of these, 9440 people (4354 men
and 5086 women) were willing to participate and were confirmed
to meet the study entry criteria. 3188 subjects were recruited
during the first year of the study, 4692 during the second year and
1560 during the third year. The remaining 4047 were ineligible
(n ¼ 2185; 54%) or declined to participate (n ¼ 1862; 46%). Thus,
of the 11 302 people who were eligible, 9440 (83.5%) were
willing to participate. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics
of the subjects randomized. Their median age was 79.1 yrs
(IQR 76.9–82.6 yrs); there were no appreciable differences between
the groups in age, previous history of fracture, prevalence and
frequency of falls in the last 6 months or residential status. Thirty-
eight per cent of the men and women had sustained a previous
clinical fracture (wrist 14%; ankle 7.4%; hip 2.8%).
Table 2 shows the number of subjects with an incident fracture
in the placebo and treated groups. Eighty-five men and 194
women in the placebo group sustained an incident fracture over
the 3-yr follow-up period. These contrasted with 68 men and 238
women in the vitamin D-treated group. There was no evidence for
a protective effect of vitamin D against fracture at any site: all

fractures [HR 1.09; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93–1.28], wrist
(HR 1.22; 95% CI 0.85–1.76), ankle (HR 1.63; 95% CI 0.84–3.17).
There was a small, but statistically significant (P ¼ 0.04) excess
risk of hip fracture associated with allocation to treatment with
vitamin D (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.02–2.18). When the genders were
analysed separately, the tendency for an increase in fracture risk
was particularly observed among women, in whom there was a
59% increase in hazard at the proximal femur or distal forearm
among those treated with vitamin D compared with placebo
(P ¼ 0.003). There was no significant effect of vitamin D treatment
on the frequency of falls (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.93–1.04).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative probability of fracture at various
skeletal sites according to treatment group. It shows steps between
6-monthly assessments, as unknown fracture time-points were
interpolated in this manner. For all non-spine fractures, there was
almost no divergence in the cumulative incidence pattern between
the vitamin D and placebo-treated patients over the 3 yrs of the
study. When the analyses were confined to fractures at the wrist,
hip or both of these sites, fracture incidence tended to be higher in
the vitamin D-treated arm when compared with those subjects
using placebo. However, these differences were not statistically
significant for the wrist (HR ¼ 1.22, 95% CI 0.85–1.76).
There were no statistically significant interactions between age,
previous fracture history or functional status and the effects of
vitamin D treatment on fracture risk; these tests of interaction
were exploratory and not pre-planned. There was, however, a
significant interaction between gender and treatment group on the
risk of any non-spine fracture such that a detrimental effect of
vitamin D was seen amongst women, but not among men
(P ¼ 0.03). Among the 200 trial participants completing the
more detailed interviewer-administered questionnaire, 22 subjects
(11%) had sustained a previous hip or wrist fracture; 48 (24%)
reported <30 min weight-bearing activity each day; 74 (37%) had
ever smoked; and only four consumed greater than 20 units of
alcohol each week. The mean dietary calcium intake of these 200
subjects was 625 mg daily (S.D. 231).
In the biochemistry study, measurements were obtained at
baseline, and at 1, 4, 8, 12, 13 and 16 months of follow-up. Among
the
43
trial
participants
included,
mean
plasma
25-OHD
concentration at baseline was 56.5 ng/ml (S.D. 23.7); PTH con-
centration 4.83 pmol/l (IQR 3.92–5.63); and 1,25-DHD concen-
tration 74.3 pmol/l (S.D. 27.5). Increases from baseline were
observed in 25-OHD and 1,25-DHD concentrations among
those subjects receiving active treatment, but not in those on
placebo. For 25-OHD, the actively treated group showed a 21%
increase at 4 months, but this was not statistically significant
(P ¼ 0.15). There was a more pronounced increase in 1,25-DHD
concentration over this period (35.7%) and this attained statistical
significance
(P ¼ 0.02).
At
this
time-point,
the
difference
between absolute 1,25-DHD concentrations (but not 25-OHD
concentrations) among actively treated and placebo subjects
was also statistically significant (P < 0.002). These changes in
vitamin D status were accompanied by only modest (17%)
suppression of PTH in the treated subjects at this time-point,
a level which did not attain statistical significance. By the eighth
month after injection, these changes had drifted towards basal
values, although the significantly higher 1,25-DHD levels in
the active group persisted (P ¼ 0.04). Observations during the

injection during the fall) broadly resembled those in the first year
of the study.
Discussion
This large, pragmatic, population-based, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial found that an annual i.m. injection
of 300 000 IU vitamin D did not reduce fracture risk when
compared with placebo. This is the largest trial to date addressing
the primary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in older people
and the largest trial of i.m. vitamin D. The trial involved over 9000
men and women aged 75 yrs and over; it was adequately powered
to detect a 30% difference in fracture rate between treatment and
placebo arms. The baseline rate of all non-osteoporotic fractures
was close to that expected using routinely derived epidemiological
data for England and Wales [11]. There were, however, fewer hip
fractures than anticipated, reflecting the relatively healthy elderly
population who chose to take part in the study. The groups were
well balanced at entry to the trial, and individuals who previously
used supplements containing 400 IU vitamin D or more daily were
excluded from entry. The method of ascertaining non-spine
fractures has been well validated previously, and the vast majority
of these could be corroborated from a second source (hospital
notes or radiographic records).
This was a large, pragmatically designed, randomized con-
trolled trial. As a consequence, the principal issue addressed was
the capacity of a public health programme of annual i.m. vitamin
D injections in the elderly, to reduce fracture incidence. This had
already been suggested by a smaller, non-randomized study. The
major deficiency of the study was the relative paucity of
explanatory measures such as assessment of vitamin D status in
the enrolled subjects, as well as other determinants of fracture risk
such as dietary calcium intake, smoking, alcohol consumption and
physical activity. We were able to recruit a small sample of
participants in whom circulating levels of 25-OHD, 1,25-DHD
and PTH were able to be evaluated over a protracted period
within the study. Although too small to allow detailed inference,
this subset clearly demonstrated that our subjects were relatively
vitamin D replete, with only around 25% falling into the range of
modest or severe deficiency (<30 ng/ml). With hindsight, it would
have been preferable to increase the size of this biochemical
subset, but the available data suggest that this intervention was
ineffective in reducing fractures in a relatively vitamin D replete
population. Additionally, the 25-OHD assays that were utilized
may have been less reliable in the estimation of vitamin D2.
We did obtain more detailed risk factor information in 200
participants that were in accord with the biochemical subset, in
revealing calcium intakes around the values previously reported in
the healthy UK elderly, and certainly well above those found
among previously published studies reporting a benefit of calcium
and vitamin D supplementation. These deficiencies limited our
ability to perform subgroup analyses adjusting for the effects of
calcium intake, vitamin D status or PTH. A third caveat is that
our intervention was vitamin D2, and data published after the
inception of this trial confirm that vitamin D2 has an attenuated
effect when compared with vitamin D3 [12–15]. The relative
potency of the plant sterol ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and the
animal form, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is disputed; comparison
of D2 and D3 potency in humans has given conflicting results
[12, 13]. The most recent study contrasting the effectiveness of
vitamin D2 with that of vitamin D3 suggested that both calciferols
produced similar rises in serum 25-OHD concentration over
3 days, but that levels declined much more rapidly in subjects
treated with D2 [14]. We opted to use the identical formulation of
ergocalciferol that was utilized in the previous Finnish study [7].
However, our dosing frequency was annual and the pharmaco-
kinetics of i.m. vitamin D might differ if administered more
frequently. Although the age, gender and socioeconomic profile of

representative of England and Wales, our study participants
were likely to have had higher functional capacity than the older
population from which they were drawn; they were more likely to
live in their own homes, and had a slightly lower than expected hip
fracture rate. Finally, information on falls was collected retro-
spectively by practice nurse interview or a postal questionnaire
enquiring about falls over the past 6 months. Although falls were
only a secondary outcome measure of the trial, it has been
established that prospective collection of falls data at frequent
intervals is more reliable than retrospective assessment over long
periods [16].
Vitamin D insufficiency is widespread in the elderly population
of northern Europe and the USA [17–19]. Supplementation is an
effective way of preventing this. A daily oral dose of 400–800 IU
has been shown to elevate serum 25-OHD levels, reduce serum
PTH and suppress markers of bone turnover in vulnerable older
people [5, 6, 20] but its cost utility in fracture prevention remains
uncertain. Giving periodic vitamin D supplementation by the i.m.
route, while somewhat invasive, has advantages over daily oral
supplements in cost-effectiveness and compliance. However, fewer
data are available on the effect of i.m. dosing on circulating
vitamin D metabolites. One study comparing i.m. with i.v. and
oral vitamin D showed a delayed rise in serum 25-OHD levels with
the i.m. route. The study also showed that in a rat model about
half of the vitamin D administered by i.m. injection remained
unaltered in situ [21], providing an additional reason why this
particular mode of delivery proved ineffective. A further possible
problem is the potential absorption of vitamin D2 on plastic
syringes, although quality assurance on the ampoules used was
undertaken at a national reference laboratory.
The effect of vitamin D supplementation on the risk of non-
vertebral fracture is unclear despite several large, well-designed
placebo-controlled trials. Two studies of daily oral supplementa-
tion using vitamin D combined with calcium demonstrated
significant decreases in non-vertebral fractures among 3270
female nursing home residents in France [3] and in 445 relatively
healthy men and women in the USA [22]. In the first of these,
supplementation appeared to have its principal effect on fracture
incidence within 18–24 months of commencing therapy. In the
second, the placebo fracture rate was among the highest recorded
in controlled trials of osteoporosis interventions (around 22%,
compared with 12% in other studies of anti-resorptive treatment).
In contrast, studies of daily oral vitamin D without calcium
supplementation have reported less or no benefit on fracture rates.
Examples include a study of 2578 elderly independent men and
women from Holland randomized to 400 IU vitamin D3 or placebo
[5], or one of 1100 residents of Norwegian nursing homes
randomized to 5 ml cod liver oil or placebo [6]. Trials using
intermittent dosing of vitamin D have been more likely to show a
reduction in fracture risk. A trial of 100 000 IU oral cholecalciferol
or placebo every 4 months in 2686 community-dwelling British
men and women aged 65 yrs found significant reductions in the
relative risk of any fracture (HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.61–0.99), or
fracture at the hip, wrist, forearm or spine (HR 0.67; 95% CI
0.48–0.93) [4]. The study that inspired this current trial utilized an
annual i.m. injection of 150 000–300 000 IU ergocalciferol in 479
Finnish men and women aged >85 yrs who were living in their own
home and 320 subjects aged 75–84 yrs living in a home for aged
people. Although treatment allocation was inadequately rando-
mized by current standards (using alternate allocation without
blinding), the group of subjects administered i.m. vitamin D had a
significantly (P ¼ 0.03) lower rate of all fractures. This was
particularly marked (P ¼ 0.02) for fractures of the upper limb,
but was not apparent for lower limb sites [7]. The present study was
considerably larger, subjects were randomized to treatment or
placebo and outcomes were assessed in a blind fashion using
validated measures. Our results clearly do not support those of
the Finnish study and suggest that an annual i.m. injection of

vitamin D does not result in a measurable reduction in the risk of
non-vertebral fractures, perhaps due to insufficient suppression of
PTH. Two recent studies of intermittent oral vitamin D admin-
istration, in contrast, have failed to reveal a reduction in fracture
risk [23, 24], Finally, the recently published Medical Research
Council Randomized Evaluation of Calcium or Vitamin D
(RECORD) Trial evaluated daily oral calcium, vitamin D,
both interventions combined, and double placebo, in 5292 men
and women aged 70 yrs and over, who had sustained a low
trauma fracture [25]. In accordance with the results of our study,
vitamin D whether alone or in combination with calcium
supplementation was ineffective in reducing the incidence of
fracture. These complex findings have been thoroughly reviewed
with the recent publication of the calcium and vitamin D
component of the Women’s Health Initiative [26]. Our data are
also in accordance with recent randomized controlled trials
of calcium supplementation in elderly women [27, 28], in which
significant reductions in fracture risk were not observed. As with
one of these studies, we also found a statistically significant
excess risk of hip fracture in the intervention group [27]; we are not
aware of any biologically plausible reason why calcium or vitamin
D supplementation should increase hip fracture risk and we concur
with the authors of that report that these observations are likeliest
due to chance. A remote possibility is that if a small number of
participants had vitamin D deficiency and osteomalacia, treatment
with vitamin D might have led to a rapid improvement in
myopathy, but the mineralization deficit might have persisted for
several months. In this situation, improved mobility might have
been associated with an increased risk of hip fracture. The latest
Cochrane Review addressing this issue [29], and a recent meta-
analysis [30] all concur that vitamin D alone is ineffective in
preventing fractures among older people, but that combined
calcium and vitamin D supplementation may decrease the
incidence of hip and other non-vertebral fractures, especially in
care home residents.
In conclusion, we have performed a large, pragmatic, ran-
domized, controlled trial comparing the anti-fracture effectiveness
of a single i.m. injection of 300 000 IU vitamin D2 annually
with placebo over a 3-yr period. Although acceptable and safe,
this intervention was not effective in reducing the incidence
of fractures among men and women aged over 75 yrs resident
in the general population.
