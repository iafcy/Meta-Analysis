Background: The 2009 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) chronic kidney disease–
mineral and bone disorder clinical practice guideline suggests correcting 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25[OH]D)
levels , 30 ng/mL in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis, but does not provide a speciﬁc
treatment protocol.
Study Design: 2-center, double-blind, randomized, 13-week, controlled trial followed by a 26-week open-
label study.
Setting & Participants: 55 adult maintenance hemodialysis patients with 25(OH)D levels , 30 ng/mL were
recruited from June 2008 through October 2009.
Intervention: Cholecalciferol, 25,000 IU, per week orally versus placebo for 13 weeks, then 26 weeks of
individualized cholecalciferol prescription based on NKF-KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation–Kidney Disease
Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines.
Outcomes: Primary end point was the percentage of patients with 25(OH)D levels $ 30 ng/mL at 13 weeks.
Secondary outcomes included the percentage of patients with normal calcium, phosphorus, and intact para-
thyroid hormone (iPTH) blood levels. Safety measures included incidence of hypercalcemia and hypervita-
minosis D.
Measurements:
Blood
calcium
and
phosphate
were
measured
weekly;
iPTH,
25(OH)D,
1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]2D), and bone turnover markers, trimonthly; fetuin A and ﬁbroblast growth
factor 23 (FGF-23) serum levels and aortic calciﬁcation scores were determined at weeks 0 and 39.
Results: The primary end point signiﬁcantly increased in the treatment group compared with the placebo
group (61.5% vs 7.4%; P , 0.001), as well as 1,25(OH)2D levels (22.5 [IQR, 15-26] vs 11 [IQR, 10-15] pg/mL;
P , 0.001) and the proportion of patients achieving the target calcium level (76.9% vs 48.2%; P 5 0.03).
Incidence of hypercalcemia and phosphate and iPTH levels were similar between groups. The second 26-
week study phase did not signiﬁcantly modify the prevalence of 25(OH)D level $ 30 ng/mL in patients
issued from the placebo group.
Limitations: Small size of the study population.
Conclusions: Oral weekly administration of 25,000 IU of cholecalciferol for 13 weeks is an effective, safe,
inexpensive, and manageable way to increase 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levels in hemodialysis patients.
Further evaluation of clinical end points is suggested.

L
evels of calcidiol (25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25
[OH]D) , 30 ng/mL are observed frequently
in patients treated with maintenance hemodialysis
(HD) in Northern latitudes.1-4 As with the general
population, this is associated with poor outcomes
in chronic kidney disease (CKD; for review, see
Nigwekar et al5), including stage 5.4,6-9
To date, a limited number of randomized controlled
trials designed to study the effect of nutritional
vitamin D (either cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol)
have been conducted in HD patients.3,10-13 This
lack of interest probably is multifactorial. As kidney
function declines, production of calcitriol (1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D]) decreases in

parallel.14,15 Since the 1980s, 1a-hydroxylated forms
of vitamin D (also called active vitamin D) became
widely used in HD patients and low-priced nutritional
forms of vitamin D were neglected.5 The existence
of extrarenal 1a-hydroxylases was suggested by the
observation that anephric individuals were able to
produce 1,25(OH)2D in response to supraphysiologic
nutritional vitamin D challenge.16,17 However, these
ﬁndings did not modify prescription habits. Further
experimental studies demonstrated that extrarenal 1a-
hydroxylases were present in a wide range of tissues
acting locally in paracrine or autocrine circuits.18 That
led to the understanding of the pleiotropic properties
of 25(OH)D19-21 and revived interest in this mole-
cule.22-24 In addition, it was noted that 25(OH)D has
an excellent safety proﬁle.16,22,25 For these reasons
and despite the absence of any controlled trial or large
prospective study, in 2009, KDIGO (Kidney Disease:
Improving Global Outcomes) recommended restora-
tion of 25(OH)D levels . 30 ng/mL in patients
treated with maintenance HD.26 However, targeted
protocols are still lacking. The high cost of the
25(OH)D assay further complicates drug prescription
and the setup of larger clinical trials.22
The present study, combining a 13-week random-
ized trial of oral cholecalciferol repletion versus
placebo with an open-label study of customized
cholecalciferol prescription derived from the NKF-
KDOQI
(National
Kidney
Foundation–Kidney
Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) guidelines27 for
26 additional weeks aimed to provide valuable in-
formation about vitamin D repletion strategies and
their possible impact on mineral and bone markers.
METHODS
Deﬁnitions
In this study, we deﬁned levels of 25(OH)D ranging from 20
to
,30 ng/mL
as
“insufﬁcient”
and
levels , 20 ng/mL
as
“deﬁcient.”5
Study Design
Overview
This was an investigator-driven, prospective, multicenter, partly
randomized, controlled trial (VitaDial) performed in 2 Belgian
nephrology centers (Epicura [in Baudour] and Erasme university
hospitals [in Brussels]). It was approved by the institutional
review board at each site. This 39-week trial was divided into
2 periods as follows: a randomized period (13 weeks) during
which enrolled patients were randomly assigned to receive either
cholecalciferol or a placebo, and an open-label period (26 weeks)
during which all patients, regardless of initial allocation, received
a cholecalciferol dose adjusted to their most recent 25(OH)D
assessment (at weeks 13 and 26; Fig 1). This design allowed in-
vestigators to collect data for a new cholecalciferol repletion
protocol using substantial doses under safe conditions (ﬁrst period
limited to 13 weeks) and, in a second phase, gather data reﬂecting
the use of NKF-KDOQI guidelines, usually prescribed for 6
months (second period of 26 weeks). Finally, by combining both
periods, we investigated the biochemical outcomes of cholecal-
ciferol repletion over a total period of 39 weeks. Another interest
of the present design was to offer cholecalciferol access to all

patients, avoiding possibly deleterious effects of long-term
vitamin D deprivation.
Randomization Period
The enrollement period was from June 2008 through October
2009. Patients who fulﬁlled the study entry criteria were randomly
assigned to receive either an oral cholecalciferol preparation or its
vehicle every week for 13 weeks, according to a 1:1 randomization
procedure. Randomization was stratiﬁed by center. We used block
randomization with permuted blocks of 4 allocations.
Open-Label Period
After the 13-week randomization period, every participant
entered a 26-week repletion phase and received a cholecalciferol
dose adjusted to his or her previous 25(OH)D level as evaluated at
weeks 13 and 26. Cholecalciferol prescriptions were based on the
2003 NKF-KDOQI guidelines for patients with CKD stages 3-4
and adapted for patients with CKD stage 5 due to the absence of
targeted guidelines for these patients27 (for details, see Fig 1).
Participants
Eligible patients were adults (aged $ 18 years) with CKD stage
5 who were receiving HD for at least 3 months with a minimum
of 3 HD sessions per week and who had serum 25(OH)D
levels , 30 ng/mL and had signed the informed consent form
approved by each center’s ethics committee. Exclusion criteria
were as follows: known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the
study medications, pregnancy or lactation period, women without
effective contraception, cholecalciferol and/or calcitriol and/or
paricalcitol and/or alfacalcidol dosage adjustment 1 month prior
to enrollment (the last 3 being the only active vitamin D formu-
lations available in Belgium), plasma calcium level . 10.2 mg/dL,
concurrent enrollment in another clinical
trial, prior para-
thyroidectomy, granulomatous disorder, active malignancy, and/or
estimated life expectancy less than 1 year.
Investigational Product and Concomitant Medications
The study drug consisted of 1 mL of groundnut oil solution
containing 25,000 IU of cholecalciferol (D-cure; S.M.B. [drug
marketing authorization number 465S24F11]), whereas the pla-
cebo was made by our study pharmacist with the same groundnut
oil as the active drug, coming directly from the D-cure factory.
Placebo and active drug were indistinguishable from each other.
Study preparations were administered orally at the end of the ﬁrst
or second HD session of the week, under the supervison of the
nurse in charge of the patient. Any other cholecalciferol supple-
mentation was withdrawn. Apart from cholecalciferol, any modi-
ﬁcation of the medical treatment, including mineral bone disorder–
related drugs, was left to the discretion of the treating nephrologist
following NKF-KDOQI guidelines.
Study Outcomes
The primary end point was the proportion of participants with
25(OH)D levels $ 30 ng/mL at week 13.
Secondary end points were the percentage of patients with
appropriate blood levels of calcium, phosphorus, and intact
parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Recommended concentrations were
8.5-10.2 mg/dL for calcium, #4.5 mg/dL for phosphate, and
146-657 pg/mL for iPTH (corresponding to 2-9 times the upper
reference limit value in our laboratory) as suggested in the 2009
KDIGO recommendations.
Safety
end
points
included
the
occurence
of
hypercal-
cemia (calcium . 10.2 mg/dL), hypervitaminosis D (deﬁned as
25(OH)D . 100 ng/mL independent of calcium level), adverse
events (fractures), serious adverse events, and malignancies.
Hypercalcemia and/or hypervitaminosis D resulted in the imme-
diate and deﬁnitive suspension of the study medication. The onset
or worsening of hyperphosphatemia (phosphate . 5.5 mg/dL) did
not lead to the cessation of study drug, but was treated with
calcium carbonate or calcium-free phosphate binders according to
NKF-KDOQI guidelines.
Sample Size Calculation
Based on preliminary data, we hypothesized that the proportion
of patients with a 25(OH)D level , 30 ng/mL would decrease to
70% in the treatment arm compared to 100% in the placebo arm.
We calculated that 22 patients were required in each group to
reach statistical power of 80% with a type I error of 5%. Finally,
we chose to recruit at least 20% extra patients (26 patients per
group) in anticipation of dropouts.
Statistical Analysis
Results were expressed as mean 6 standard deviation, median
with interquartile range (IQR), or percentage. Continuous vari-
ables were compared using t test or Mann-Whitney test in cases
of non-Gaussian distribution. Paired data were compared using
paired t test, analysis of variance for repeated measures, or
Friedman and Wilcoxon test in cases of non-Gaussian distribution.
Categorical data were compared using c2 or Fisher exact test.
Paired categorical data were compared using c2 McNemar test.
Relevant results were expressed as number needed to treat (NNT;
deﬁned as the inverse of absolute risk reduction). All study end
points were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA software,
version 12 (StataCorp LP). P , 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant.
Sampling
Blood samplings were performed regularly at the beginning
of the ﬁrst or second HD session of the week, through the
arterial tubing. Plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus were
checked every week. Serum levels of iPTH, osteocalcin, carboxy-
terminal telopeptides, bone alkaline phosphatases, 25(OH)D,
and 1,25(OH)2D were assessed every 13 weeks. Extra serum was
collected and frozen (220C) at baseline and end of the study
(week 39) in order to ultimately assess fetuin A and ﬁbroblast
growth factor 23 (FGF-23) levels. When available (.300 mL), a
24-hour urine sample was collected at baseline.
Biochemical Assessments
Plasma biochemistry samples were analyzed with a standard
multichannel biochemical analyzer (Modular P; Roche), except
for the following parameters: serum iPTH and 25(OH)D were
measured according to a direct chemiluminescence method
(module LIAISON M; DiaSorin Inc) in the Erasme Hospital
laboratory, Brussels (accredited by DEQAS [Vitamin D External
Quality Assessment Scheme]); serum 1,25(OH)2D was measured
in an experienced laboratory (Brugmann Hospital, Brussels,
Belgium) after extraction, using a competitive radioimmuno-
assay (DiaSorin Inc); serum levels of osteocalcin and C-telo-
peptides
were
evaluated
by
electrochemiluminescence
technology (module E170; Roche); serum bone alkaline phos-
phatases were assessed by a chemiluminescence-based immu-
noenzymatic
assay
with
paramagnetic
particles
(Beckman
Coulter Inc); serum fetuin A was measured by nephelometry
(assay designed, developed, and performed by Prof W. Jahnen-
Dechent, RWTH, Aachen University, Germany). Nephelometric
readings were taken in a MiniNeph single cuvette nephelometer
(The Binding Site). Puriﬁed human plasma fetuin A (Dade-Behring)
served as support plotted to derive the calibration curve; FGF-23
carboxy-terminal fragments were measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (Immutopics Inc).

Radiologic Assessment of Anterior-Posterior Aortic
Calciﬁcations
All
patients
had
lateral
lumbar
radiographs
for
semi-
quantiﬁcation of aortic calciﬁcations at baseline and week 39.
Aortic calciﬁcation scores, according to the method published by
Kauppila et al,28 were established by 2 independent observers in
a blinded and randomized fashion. Scores ranged from 0 (no
calciﬁcation) to 24.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Demographics
Figure 2 shows patient ﬂow throughout the trial. A
total of 176 patients were screened: 26 patients
subsequently entered the treatment arm and 29
entered the placebo arm. Both groups were well
balanced with respect to patient demographics, co-
morbid conditions, and medications relative to min-
eral bone disorder, as well as season of enrollment
(Table 1).
Efﬁcacy End Points
At week 13, a total of 26 and 27 patients remained
for analysis in the treament and placebo groups,
respectively; 2 patients were lost to follow-up in the
placebo group (n 5 1, kidney transplantation; n 5 1,
death from arrhythmia). Regarding the primary end
point, 16 of 26 (62%; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI],
41%-80%) patients from the treatment group had their
25(OH)D levels normalized ($30 ng/mL) at week 13
versus 2 of 27 (7%; 95% CI, 1%-24%) in the placebo
group (P , 0.001; NNT 5 1.8 [95% CI, 1.4-3.4]). Mean
25(OH)D levels were 35.2 6 12.1 ng/mL in the treat-
ment group versus 16.4 6 7.8 ng/mL in the placebo
group (P , 0.001). At the end of the ﬁrst period, 1 of 26
(4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-20%) patients in the treatment group
versus 17 of 27 (63%; 95% CI, 42%-81%) in the placebo
group presented with 25(OH)D deﬁciency (,20 ng/mL;
P , 0.001; NNT 5 1.7 [95% CI, 1.3-2.85]; Fig 3).

Patients in the control group had signiﬁcantly
increased serum 1,25(OH)2D levels compared with
those in the placebo group (median, 22.5 [IQR, 15-26]
vs 11 [IQR, 10-15] ng/mL, respectively; P , 0.001),
leading to a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of patients
with normalized 1,25(OH)2D levels (54% [95% CI,
33%-73%] vs 12% [95% CI, 2%-30%]; P 5 0.001;
NNT 5 2.3 [95% CI, 1.6-5.9]; Fig 3).
Regarding the secondary end points, at 13 weeks,
a higher proportion of treated patients achieved the
target for calcium of 8.5-10.2 mg/dL (77% [95% CI,
56%-91%] vs 44% [95% CI, 29%-68%]; P 5 0.02;
NNT 5 3.1 [95% CI, 1.9-16.2]). Otherwise, the treat-
ment did not signiﬁcantly affect blood levels of cal-
cium, phosphorus, or iPTH (Fig 4) or bone turnover
parameters (data not shown; Table S1, available as
online supplementary material).
Impact of Randomization Group on Drug Prescription
At week 13, bone mineral disorder–targeted treat-
ments did not differ according to randomization group
(Table S2).
Safety End Points
During the randomization period, one patient
from the placebo group developed a plasma calcium
level . 10.2 mg/dL (10.4 mg/dL). This event was con-
comitant to hypovitaminosis D (25[OH]D, 20 ng/mL;
1,25[OH]2D, 14 pg/mL), hypoparathyroidism, and low-
dose calcium supplements (iPTH, 40 pg/mL; elemental
calcium intake, 0.4 g/d; Table S3). At week 27, hyper-
calcemia with a calcium level of 10.3 mg/dL occured
in a second patient from the treatment group. Over 26
weeks, he received a total cumulative cholecalciferol
dose of 400,000 IU. Hypercalcemia coexisted with an
elevated 25(OH)D level (68 ng/mL), low 1,25(OH)2D
level (14 pg/mL), high iPTH level (700 pg/mL), and
elemental calcium intake of 1.2 g/d (Table S3).
During the entire study, no patient developed
a 25(OH)D level . 100 ng/mL. The highest levels
recorded at weeks 13, 26, and 39 were 57, 81, and
43 ng/mL, respectively. Corresponding calcium levels
were 9, 8.5, and 8.3 mg/dL, respectively.
Table 2 shows a summary of the incidence of
serious adverse events. Patients who received chole-
calciferol in the ﬁrst 13 weeks of the study experi-
enced no bone fractures and fewer hospitalizations
for falls compared with patients who received pla-
cebo treatment in the ﬁrst phase of the study.
Nine patients from the placebo group experienced
10 distinct fracture episodes during the entire study
period.

Evolution of Mineral and Bone Parameters During the
39-Week Study Period
Despite receiving different treatment regimens
during the ﬁrst 13-week phase, patients in the treat-
ment and placebo groups had similar 25(OH)D levels
at 26 weeks (31.5 6 15.5 vs 28.0 6 9.3 ng/mL;
P 5 0.3) and 39 weeks (25.9 6 9.2 vs 26.4 6 9.1 ng/
mL; P 5 0.9). Because all patients underwent a
25(OH)D repletion program when the 39-week study
period is considered as a whole, we were able to
analyze them as a single cohort for the 39-week
period. During the entire study, effective 25(OH)D

A
statistically
signiﬁcant
decrease in serum fetuin A levels was observed
(median of 0.39 [IQR, 0.34-0.42] mg/mL at week 0
vs 0.33 [IQR, 0.29-0.36] mg/mL at week 39;
P , 0.001). Levels of carboxy-terminal telopeptides,
bone alkaline phosphatases, osteocalcin, and FGF-23
did not change signiﬁcantly.
Vascular Calciﬁcation Scores
At week 39, patients had similar calciﬁcation
scores (median, 4.5 [IQR, 1-12.5] vs 11 [IQR, 2-14];
P 5 0.4) regardless of whether they had received
treatment (n 5 21) or placebo (n 5 16) in the ﬁrst 13
weeks of the study. Taking into account available
paired scores (n 5 30) for a longitudinal comparison
between
weeks
0
and
39,
calciﬁcation
scores
remained stable (median, 7 [IQR, 2-14] vs 7.5 [IQR,
2-15]; P 5 0.3). Of note, 15 of 53 patients without a
history of cholecalciferol treatment had a higher
calciﬁcation score at baseline (median, 13 [IQR, 6-18]
vs 7 [IQR, 1-14]; P 5 0.05).
Comparison of Our Repletion Protocol With NKF-
KDOQI Guidelines
In patients who were in the placebo group for the
ﬁrst 13 weeks of the trial, cholecalciferol supple-
mentation based on the 2003 NKF-KDOQI guidelines
signiﬁcantly reduced the proportion of patients with a
25(OH)D level , 30 ng/mL (from 92% to 54%) after
13 weeks (22/24 vs 13/24 at weeks 13 and 26,
respectively; P 5 0.007). This effect was not sus-
tained at week 39, with this proportion increasing
again to 65% (21/23 vs 15/23 at weeks 13 and 39,
respectively; P 5 0.07).
In the placebo arm, cholecalciferol supplementa-
tion based on the 2003 NKF-KDOQI guidelines
signiﬁcantly reduced the proportion of 25(OH)D-
deﬁcient patients (from 63% to 17%) after 13 weeks
(15/24 vs 4/24 at weeks 13 and 26, respectively;
P , 0.001) and also after 26 weeks (13/23 [57%] vs
5/23 [22%] at weeks 13 and 39, respectively;
P 5 0.008).
Finally, the respective proportions of patients with
persistently low 25(OH)D levels (either ,20 or
,30 ng/mL) were compared between the treatment
group at week 13 and the placebo group at weeks 26
and 39. There was a nominally lower proportion of
patients with persistent 25(OH)D levels , 30 ng/mL
in patients treated with our study repletion protocol at
week 13 compared with patients from the placebo
arm treated with the NKF-KDOQI recommendations
after 26 weeks, but this result was not statistically
signiﬁcant (10 of 26 [38%] vs 14 of 21 [67%];
P 5 0.05).
DISCUSSION
Therapeutic strategies to correct vitamin D deﬁ-
ciency have not been studied extensively in main-
tenance HD patients. Our randomized study showed
that administration of a weekly dose of 25,000 IU
of
cholecalciferol
over
13
weeks
resulted
in
normalization of 25(OH)D levels ($30 ng/mL) in
62% of patients, in 1,25(OH)2D levels $ 20 pg/mL
in 54%, and in calcium concentrations within the
KDIGO normal range in 77% without serious
adverse events. Patients in the treatment group
experienced dramatically fewer bone fractures and
hospitalizations for falls than patients in the placebo
group. Despite the limited size of our patient cohort,
our ﬁndings reinforce prior studies associating
25(OH)D deﬁciency with increased risk of fracture
among patients on maintenance HD therapy or
those supporting the positive impact of vitamin D
on muscle strength and balance in the elderly and
patients with CKD.8,29-31
Decades ago, it was shown that anephric humans
and 5/6 nephrectomized dogs, unlike healthy indivi-
duals, increased their 1,25(OH)2D levels in response

to a supraphysiologic cholecalciferol challenge.16,17
Several clinical prospective studies conﬁrmed the
incremental effects of 25(OH)D supplementation on
1,25(OH)2D levels in patients with CKD stage 5.
However, inconsistent results were obtained for PTH
and calcium levels.2,3,11,32,33 Only a few randomized
controlled
studies
described
the
increment
of
1,25(OH)2D levels after cholecalciferol challenge in
HD patients.10,11,13 None was able to conﬁrm a sig-
niﬁcant impact on either PTH or calcium levels.
However, the study of Hewitt et al13 showed that
patients receiving cholecalciferol were prescribed
less calcium carbonate than controls. The present
randomized
study
conﬁrms
that
cholecalciferol,
given at physiologic doses, triggers 1,25(OH)2D
synthesis in maintenance HD patients. This ﬁnding
is in contrast to the absence of a 1,25(OH)2D level
increase in anephric patients receiving physiologic
doses of cholecalciferol.34,35 Together, these obser-
vations support residual renal 1a-hydroxylase activ-
ity rather than extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)2D.
In our opinion, a challenge with 25(OH)D could
precede the prescription of 1a-hydroxylated forms
of vitamin D that are more expensive and asso-
ciated with a higher risk of hypercalcemia and
hyperphosphatemia.
Considering the open-label phase of the study,
our results show that the repletion protocol based
on the NKF-KDOQI guidelines resulted in a sig-
niﬁcant reduction in the prevalence of 25(OH)D
deﬁciency. However, the treatment goal stated in
the same guidelines (25[OH]D . 30 ng/dL) was not
reached. Our own repletion protocol yielded a higher
proportion of patients within the 25(OH)D target.
During the whole study, the only signiﬁcant change
in bone and mineral metabolism biological parame-
ters observed was a signiﬁcant decrease in fetuin A
levels. Considering that current published reports
are conﬂicting,36,37 further investigations are needed.
In clinical practice, the choice of a vitamin D
preparation is restricted by national market availabil-
ity. However, calciferols should not be regarded as
interchangeable.38,39 In healthy individuals, adminis-
tration of cholecalciferol gives rise to higher and more
sustained 25(OH)D serum concentrations and is
considered to be at least 2 times more potent than
ergocalciferol. By giving cholecalciferol in doses
quantitatively identical to ergocalciferol doses recom-
mended by the NKF-KDOQI guidelines, we expected
to have overestimated their effects. We suggest, as
have others, that vitamin D dosing should be recon-
sidered with regard to the NKF-KDOQI goal.40-42
To conclude, our work emphasizes that physio-
logic doses of cholecalciferol affect various mineral
and bone biochemical parameters among mainte-
nance HD patients. These effects are likely to be
based on residual renal 1a-hydroxylation of vitamin
D compounds rather than activity in extrarenal sites.
The present study did not directly test the impact of
vitamin D repletion on hard clinical end points
during long-term follow-up. However, it raised
striking observations concerning fracture and fall
rates
that
merit
testing
in
larger
randomized
controlled studies.
