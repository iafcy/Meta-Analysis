falls and non-vertebral fractures: secondary and post-hoc 
outcomes from the randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled ViDA trial

Summary
Background Adults with low concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in blood have an increased risk of falls 
and fractures, but randomised trials of vitamin D supplementation have had inconsistent results. We aimed to assess 
the effect of high-dose vitamin D supplementation on fractures and falls.
Methods The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of healthy 
volunteers aged 50–84 years conducted at one centre in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were randomly assigned 
to receive either an initial oral dose of 200 000 IU (5·0 mg) colecalciferol (vitamin D3) followed by monthly 100 000 IU 
(2·5 mg) colecalciferol or equivalent placebo dosing. The prespecified primary outcome was cardiovascular disease 
and secondary outcomes were respiratory illness and fractures. Here, we report secondary outcome data for fractures 
and post-hoc outcome data for falls. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for 
time to first fracture or time to first fall in individuals allocated vitamin D compared with placebo. The analysis of 
fractures included all participants who gave consent and was by intention-to-treat; the analysis of falls included all 
individuals who returned one or more questionnaires. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand 
Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12611000402943.
Findings Between April 5, 2011, and Nov 6, 2012, 5110 participants were recruited and randomly assigned either 
colecalciferol (n=2558) or placebo (n=2552). Two participants allocated placebo withdrew consent after randomisation; 
thus, a total of 5108 individuals were included in the analysis of fractures. The mean age of participants was 65·9 years 
(SD 8·3) and 2971 (58%) were men. The mean concentration of 25(OH)D in blood was 63 nmol/L (SD 24) at baseline, 
with 1534 (30%) having 25(OH)D concentrations lower than 50 nmol/L. Follow-up was until July 31, 2015, with a mean 
treatment duration of 3·4 years (SD 0·4, range 2·5–4·2). During follow-up, 2638 participants reported having a fall, 
1312 (52%) of 2539 in the vitamin D group compared with 1326 (53%) of 2517 in the placebo group. The HR for falls—
adjusted for age, sex, ethnic origin, history of recent fall, physical activity, and baseline 25(OH)D—was 0·99 (95% CI 
0·92–1·07; p=0·82) for vitamin D compared with placebo. Non-vertebral fractures were reported in 292 individuals, 
156 (6%) of 2558 in the vitamin D group and 136 (5%) of 2550 in the placebo group. The adjusted HR for fractures was 
1·19 (95% CI 0·94–1·50; p=0·15) for vitamin D compared with placebo. 123 (2%) people died during the trial, 
65 assigned vitamin D and 58 allocated placebo; the difference between treatment groups was not significant.
Interpretation High-dose bolus vitamin D supplementation of 100 000 IU colecalciferol monthly over 2·5–4·2 years 
did not prevent falls or fractures in this healthy, ambulatory, adult population. Further research is needed to ascertain 
the effects of daily vitamin D dosing, with or without calcium.

Introduction
Rickets 
and 
osteomalacia 
are 
well 
established 
consequences of vitamin D deficiency.1 Low blood 
concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) have 
also been associated with increased risk of osteoporotic 
fractures in some observational studies.1–3 However, 
trials of vitamin D supplementation for fracture 
prevention have had inconsistent results. Although 
findings of an early trial reported a 32% reduction in 
non-vertebral fractures with vitamin D and calcium 
supplementation in elderly women,4 later trials have 
variously reported null, increased, or decreased risk of 
fractures with vitamin D supplementation.5,6 Similar 
uncertainty relates to vitamin D supplementation and 
risk of falls.7–11 Incon­sis­tencies have been attributed 
variously to differences in vitamin D dosage (frequency 
and amount), type of preparation (eg, colecalciferol 
[vitamin D3] or ergocalciferol [vitamin D2]), mode 
of administration (oral or intramuscular injections), 
baseline vitamin D status of the study population, and 
use of additional calcium supplementation.
The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study12 was 
designed 
to 
assess 
whether 
oral 
colecalciferol 
administered as a monthly dose of 100 000 IU (2·5 mg)

would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (primary 
out­come) or respiratory illness or fractures (secondary 
outcomes) in a community-based population in 
New Zealand. We additionally obtained data for falls 
(post-hoc outcome). We report here the results for 
fractures and falls.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial at the School of Population Health, University of 
Auckland Tāmaki Campus, Auckland, New Zealand.12 
We identified potential study participants from family 
practice registers and community groups and recruited 
them to the study by post and subsequent follow-up 
telephone calls.  Inclusion criteria were: age 50–84 years, 
resident in Auckland at time of recruitment, and 
anticipated residence in New Zealand for the study 
period. Exclusion criteria were: current use of vitamin D 
supplements (>600 IU per day if aged 50–70 years, 
>800 IU per day if aged 71–84 years); having a 
psychiatric disorder that would limit the participant’s 
ability to comply with the study protocol; a history of 
hypercalcaemia, nephrolithiasis, sarcoidosis, para­
thyroid disease, or gastric bypass surgery; or a serum-
corrected blood calcium concentration greater than 
2·5 mmol/L.
Ethics approval for the study was granted by the Multi-
region Ethics Committee, Wellington (MEC/09/08/082) 
in October, 2010. All participants gave written informed 
consent. 
Randomisation and masking
We randomly allocated participants by computer to either 
vitamin D supplementation with colecalciferol or placebo, 
with random block sizes of eight, ten, or 12 and stratified 
by ethnic origin (Māori, Pacific Islander, south Asian, 
European, or other) and 5-year age groups. Participants 
and study personnel were unaware of assigned groups. 
To achieve masking, the placebo capsule was identical in 
appearance to the colecalciferol preparation.
Procedures
We did baseline interviews at the School of Population 
Health.12 We obtained information about socio­
demographic status, lifestyle (eg, current tobacco 
smoking, alcohol consumption over the previous 
12 months, and usual leisure-time physical activity over 
the previous 3 months), history of falls in the previous 
4 weeks, intake of vitamin D or calcium supplements, 
and medical history of osteoporosis or fracture. We also 
took baseline measurements of height to the nearest 
0·1 cm and bodyweight to the nearest 0·1 kg (in light 
clothing without shoes), and we obtained (during the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
When the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) Study was planned in 
2010 with the primary and secondary outcomes of 
cardiovascular disease, fractures, and acute respiratory 
infections, extensive observational data were available linking 
low vitamin D status with increased risk of several important 
adverse health events. However, findings of the largest 
randomised trial to date—the Women’s Health Initiative—had 
shown no effect of vitamin D and calcium supplementation on 
cardiovascular disease, and other studies were underpowered for 
cardiovascular events. For this report of secondary and post-hoc 
outcomes of falls and fractures, we initially searched PubMed 
between Jan 1, 1985, and Dec 31, 2010, with the terms 
“vitamin D”, “fractures”, “falls”, and “randomized trials”, then 
updated our search to Jan 31, 2016. Extensive reviews had been 
published, including an Institute of Medicine report and 
meta-analyses of randomised trials, including Cochrane reviews. 
Meta-analyses of randomised trials of vitamin D 
supplementation on risk of falls and fractures—including the 
Cochrane reviews—had inconsistent conclusions that were 
attributed variously to the formulation of vitamin D (D2 or D3), 
how vitamin D was administered (injection or orally), the 
frequency of administration (daily doses or large intermittent 
bolus doses), additional calcium supplementation, and baseline 
vitamin D status of the study populations. An Institute of 
Medicine report from 2011 highlighted the limited number of 
long-term clinical trials related to calcium and vitamin D intake 
and health outcomes. The rationale for the ViDA trial was to do a 
large randomised trial in a community-based population using a 
monthly bolus dose of 100 000 IU colecalciferol (vitamin D3) 
that was designed to raise average year-round concentrations of 
vitamin D in blood to 80–100 nmol/L, which are levels recorded 
in young adults living in the tropics and associated with 
optimum health in observational studies up to 2010. 
The monthly bolus dose was designed to improve compliance 
and public health feasibility. 
Added value of this study
Results from the ViDA trial indicate that a monthly dose of 
100 000 IU colecalciferol, with good compliance in a healthy, 
middle-aged, older, ambulatory population, showed no reduced 
risk of falls or fractures over 4 years.
Implications of all the available evidence
These findings, taken in conjunction with results from other 
trials, suggest that large monthly bolus doses of vitamin D do 
not confer overall benefit either in frail elderly people or in a 
healthy, ambulatory, general population. Further study is 
needed to ascertain whether daily dosing might have 
different effects. Several international trials are ongoing to 
investigate this issue (eg, VITAL in the USA [NCT01169259]; 
DO-HEALTH in Europe [NCT01745263]; and FIND in Finland 
[NCT01463813]).

morning or afternoon) a non-fasting blood sample to 
screen for hypercalcaemia. We stored remaining serum 
samples at –80°C for later measurement of 25(OH)D.
The study drug was provided as 100 000 IU (2·5 mg) 
colecalciferol capsule or identical placebo. Mailing of the 
capsules started in June, 2011. At the start of the 
intervention, we sent participants two doses of the 
capsules, to provide an initial loading dose of 200 000 IU 
(5·0 mg) colecalciferol or identical placebo; thereafter, 
we sent one capsule of 100 000 IU (2·5 mg) colecalciferol—
equivalent to a daily dose of 3290 IU (83 μg)—or identical 
placebo, by post every month until June, 2013. From 
July, 2013, to July, 2015, we posted four capsules every 
4 months as a cost-control measure, and we emailed or 
posted monthly reminders for participants to take the 
capsule. We selected the monthly 100 000 IU colecalciferol 
dose because it was known to maintain amounts in 
serum of 25(OH)D above 90 nmol/L for at least a month 
after ingestion.13 At the time of designing the study, 
observational studies suggested that a range of 
80–100 nmol/L was associated with optimum health.14
We gathered information about falls by self-report 
using a one-page questionnaire and reply-paid envelope 
in which participants were asked to report adherence, 
falls, and fractures. The questionnaire was posted with 
the study drugs every month from June, 2011, to 
June, 2013, then every month with the reminder letter to 
November, 2013, then every 4 months with the study 
drugs to July, 2015. Although this questionnaire has not 
been validated in this population, we used the wording 
recommended by expert consensus to measure falls.15 
We asked participants in each monthly questionnaire, 
“In the past month, since you took your last capsule, 
have you had any fall including a slip or trip in which you 
lost your balance and landed on the floor or ground or 
lower level?”; and in each 4-monthly questionnaire we 
asked, “In the last 4 months, have you had any falls 
including a slip or trip in which you lost your balance 
and landed on the floor or ground or lower level?”. If the 
participant’s response was positive, we asked them to 
indicate the number of falls, either one or two or more 
for the monthly questionnaire and either one, two, three, 
or four or more for the 4-monthly questionnaire. If a fall 
caused an injury, we asked the participant to specify 
whether they hit their head or suffered a strain or sprain 
(to muscles or ligaments), whether they had a cut, bruise, 
bleeding, or abrasion to the skin, or whether they had a 
fracture of a bone or bones from the fall. We classified 
these falls as injury falls.
We obtained information about fractures from 
two sources. First, the Ministry of Health allocates all 
New Zealand residents a unique National Health Index 
number, which we used to track hospital discharges (with 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems, 10th revision [ICD-10] coding) 
for all participants during the follow-up period. We 
defined fractures as hospital discharges with the primary 
(A code) diagnosis or the secondary (B code) diagnosis for 
specified ICD-10 codes. Second, we identified falls through 
the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), which is 
the national governmental insurance organisation that 
covers all New Zealand residents for any medical and 
hospital costs from injury. We defined fractures as claims 
made after randomisation with specified ICD-10 or Read 
version 2 codes (appendix p 1). We identified deaths using 
Ministry of Health mortality files.
We measured serum-corrected calcium the day after 
we had obtained blood samples at the baseline interview, 
on a 183 Siemens Advia 2400 analyser (Siemens Healthcare 
Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany) in a central laboratory. 
We measured amounts of 25(OH)D in serum (combining 
vitamin D2 and D3) in baseline aliquots, which we had 
stored frozen at –80°C after the baseline interview, by high-
performance 
liquid 
chromatography–tandem 
mass 
spectrometry (AB Sciex API 4000; Framingham, MA, 
USA) at a laboratory participating in the Vitamin D 
External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS). To assess 
intervention effects on concentrations in blood of 25(OH)D 
we randomly selected a group of participants using a list of 
random numbers and asked them to return at 6, 12, 24, 
and 36 months to provide further blood samples for 
measurement of serum-corrected calcium concentration 
and 25(OH)D (stored with and measured at the same time 
as the baseline blood sample for each participant).
Outcomes
The prespecified primary outcome for the ViDA trial was 
incident cardiovascular disease; prespecified secondary 
outcomes were non-vertebral fractures and respiratory 
infection. In the registered protocol, data collection for 
falls was included as a safety outcome, and the 2011 
contract with a funder (the ACC) specified detailed data for 
falls. Because a formal protocol amendment was not 
made, the falls outcome is post hoc. Results for the primary 
outcome (cardiovascular disease) have been reported 
previously,16 and findings for the other secondary outcome 
(respiratory infection) will be reported elsewhere.
We assessed self-reported adverse events using the 
mailed questionnaire, with questions separate from 
those for falls. We made no attempt to grade adverse 
events or to judge if any adverse events were related to 
study treatment.
Statistical analysis
The study sample size had 80% power (estimated post 
hoc) to detect a 10% relative reduction in falls (1% sig­
nificance level), assuming 50% of participants would 
have at least one fall, based on a study in primary care 
showing that 24% of patients reported a fall in the 
previous 12 months.17 The study had an 80% chance of 
detecting a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·76 for non-vertebral 
fractures (5% significance level), based on estimated 
incidence in New Zealand18 anticipating 430 people 
would have fractures during the trial.

Analysis of the falls outcome was dependent on the 
number of returned questionnaires throughout the 
follow-up period. We included in the analysis only 
participants who returned one or more questionnaires. 
We defined the date of the fall as approximately halfway 
through the coverage period of the questionnaire. 
We assumed no fall happened during the period of the 
questionnaire if a questionnaire was not returned. 
We censored participants (ie, last date noted for estimation 
of follow-up time) at the last questionnaire they returned.
We analysed the fracture outcome on an intention-to-
treat basis, including all participants who gave consent. 
We used the National Health Index number to identify 
admissions for fracture in Ministry of Health data and 
claims for fractures in ACC data, irrespective of whether 
participants continued to take part actively in the study 
by returning the home questionnaire.
For the prespecified analysis of fractures, we used the 
Cox proportional hazards model—with robust sandwich 
variance estimates and exact p values—to calculate HRs 
based on time to first fracture for vitamin D compared 
with placebo. We used a similar approach for the post-
hoc analysis of falls, calculating HRs based on time to 
first fall. In supplemental observational analyses, to 
assess the validity of both outcome measures we analysed 
(in individuals allocated placebo) the HRs for falls and 
fractures associated with known risk factors. We tested 
the proportional hazards assumptions and none was 
violated. We treated individuals who died without having 
a documented fall or fracture up to the end of follow-up 
as censored observations.
Because 25(OH)D values are seasonally dependent, use 
of observed levels adds random variability to analyses; 
therefore, we calculated a deseasonalised 25(OH)D value 
that predicts the average level for every participant over 
four seasons. We calculated deseasonalised concentrations 
using a sinusoidal model from the baseline values for all 
participants.19 We defined vitamin D sufficiency in the 
protocol as having a deseasonalised value for 25(OH)D 
greater than 50 nmol/L (adjusted baseline >50 nmol/L for 
at least 6 months of the year) for the a-priori prespecified 
subgroup analysis. For supplemental exploratory analyses 
for heterogeneity, we also stratified results according 
to baseline 25(OH)D (<25 nmol/L or ≥75 nmol/L). 
We adjusted testing of the treatment effect for stratification 
variables age, sex, ethnic origin, and deseasonalised base­
line 25(OH)D. For falls, we also included history of recent 
fall (in the last 4 weeks) and baseline physical activity in the 
model. We assessed interactions between treatment group 
and sex, age, ethnic origin, and deseasonalised 25(OH)D.

We also did subgroup analyses for deseasonalised 
baseline 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L and—for the fall 
analyses—those with a history of falls and those with 
greater physical activity, as prespecified in the protocol.
Although not prespecified explicitly in the protocol, 
we did additional observational analyses of individuals 
assigned placebo to examine whether risk factors for 
fractures and falls in this population were consistent 
with those in existing observational published work and 
to indicate that the ascertainment of these endpoints was 
reasonable and that this population was similar to others 
with respect to these risk factors.

Results
Between April 5, 2011, and Nov 6, 2012, 47 905 people 
from 55 general practices in Auckland, New Zealand, 
were sent an invitation letter for the ViDA study, of 
whom 8851 replied and were assessed for eligibility 
(figure 1). 5250 individuals were eligible for the study and 
agreed to a baseline interview. 140 people were excluded 
after the interview, mainly those who did not return a 
run-in questionnaire within 4 weeks to confirm they had 
taken a blinded capsule. 5110 participants were randomly 
assigned either vitamin D supplementation with cole­
calciferol (n=2558) or placebo (n=2552).

Baseline 
characteristics 
of 
randomly 
assigned 
participants were similar between the vitamin D and 
placebo groups (table 1). Mean age of participants was 
65·9 years (SD 8·3), with most individuals (3658 [72%] 
of 5110) aged 60–79 years. More men were recruited to 
the study than were women (2971 [58%] vs 2139 [42%]). 
Just under half of participants (2378 [47%] of 5110) 
reported a previous fracture. Vitamin D supplements 
(within the study’s eligibility criteria) were taken by 
408 (8%) participants.
Two participants assigned placebo withdrew their 
consent after randomisation; therefore, 2558 people 
assigned vitamin D supplementation and 2550 allocated 
placebo were included in the prespecified analysis of 
fractures and were followed up to July 31, 2015. Mean 
duration of study treatment was 3·4 years (SD 0·4, 
range 2·5–4·2). 2513 (98%) of 2558 individuals assigned 
vitamin D supplementation and 2491 (98%) of 
2552 allocated placebo confirmed they had started the 
study capsules within 2 months. Only 21 (1%) parti­cipants 
assigned vitamin D supplemen­tation and 49 (2%) allocated 
placebo never confirmed capsule ingestion at any time 
during the follow-up period. 122 706 questionnaires were 
posted, of which 107 859 (88%) were returned. 5056 people 
returned one or more question­naires and were included 
in the post-hoc analysis of falls (figure 1). Retention of 
participants was good during the follow-up period, with 
2177 (86%) of 2539 individuals assigned vitamin D 
supplementation and 2138 (85%) of 2517 people allocated 
placebo participating actively during the last 5 months of 
the follow-up period. 4032 (81%) partici­pants returned the 
final July, 2015, questionnaire and a further 283 (6%) 
returned the penultimate March, 2015, questionnaire. 
123 individuals died before an event up to the end of 
follow-up and were censored, 65 who were assigned 
vitamin D supplementation and 58 allocated placebo. 
We do not know whether these deaths were associated 
directly with a fall or fracture. Deaths did not differ 
between treatment groups.
Among the 5108 randomised participants, the mean 
baseline concentration of 25(OH)D—not corrected for 
season—was 63 nmol/L (SD 24), varying from a maximum 
monthly mean of 77 nmol/L (22) in March to a minimum 
monthly mean of 55 nmol/L (24) in August. The mean 
baseline deseasonalised value (ie, amounts averaged over 
four seasons) was 66 nmol/L (SD 23). Of 515 participants 
randomly selected to return and give blood samples for 
assessment of adherence, 441 accepted the invitation. 
Mean baseline 25(OH)D concentrations in this sub­
population (unadjusted for season) were similar to those 
in the whole cohort (61 nmol/L [SD 24]). The mean 
amount of 25(OH)D had increased substantially by 
6 months among participants assigned vitamin D 
supplementation in this subpopulation, with mean values 
(unadjusted for season) 54–69 nmol/L higher than in the 
placebo group throughout follow-up (appendix p 2). Only 
a few people in the vitamin D group had a 25(OH)D 
concentration that remained below 50 nmol/L at any 
timepoint (appendix p 2). These results are consistent 
with 
the 
high 
adherence 
to 
study 
treatment 
reported by participants in the returned question­
naires (168 667 capsules [84%] were reported taken during 
200 936 person-months). Vitamin D supplemen­tation had 
no effect on corrected serum calcium concentrations, 
which were mean 2·3 mmol/L (SD 0·1) in each study 
group at all timepoints, apart from at 36 months when the 
concentration was 2·4 mmol/L (0·1) in each study group.
Falls were reported by just over half of all participants 
(2638 [52%] of 5056) during the follow-up period. 
The probability of reporting one or more falls (the falls 
endpoint) was similar for those assigned to vitamin D 
supplementation compared with placebo (1312 [52%] 
of 2539 vs 1326 [53%] of 2517; HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·92–1·06, 
after adjustment for sex, age, and ethnic origin; HR 0·99, 
0·92–1·07, when further adjusted for history of recent 
fall, physical activity, and baseline 25[OH]D; table 2,

proportion reporting one, two, or more than two falls did 
not differ (p=0·98) between vitamin D and placebo 
groups (respectively, 582 [44%] of 1312 vs 591 [45%] of 
1326; 353 [27%] of 1312 vs 359 [27%] of 1326; and 
377 [29%] of 1312 vs 376 [28%] of 1326). Further­more, the 
number of injury falls did not differ between treatment 
groups, with 1049 (41%) reported in 2539 participants 
assigned vitamin D versus 1020 (41%) in 2517 individuals 
allocated placebo (after adjustment for sex, age, ethnic 
origin, 25[OH]D <50 nmol/L, falls in the last 4 weeks, and 
vigorous activity >2 h per week: HR 1·03, 95% CI 
0·95–1·13; p=0·46).
Subgroup analyses did not show any difference in the 
risk of falls between participants allocated vitamin D 
and those assigned placebo (table 2) with respect to 
deseasonalised baseline 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L 
(307 [51%] of 602 vs 316 [49%] of 645, respectively; 
p=0·45), history of falls in the 4 weeks before the baseline 
interview (110 [76%] of 145 vs 109 [69%] of 157; p=0·25), 
or being physically active at baseline and undertaking 
vigorous activity for more than 2 h per week (405 [51%] 
of 800 vs 421 [51%] of 823; p=0·92). No interactions were 
noted between treatment and sex (p=0·13), ethnic origin 
(p=0·51), age (p=0·49), or deseasonalised 25(OH)D 
(p=0·80).
In the placebo group, reporting of falls was higher in 
women than in men (644 [60%] of 1082 vs 682 [48%] 
of 1435; HR 1·42, 95% CI 1·27–1·59; p<0·0001) and in 
those who had a fall in the 4 weeks before the study (1·73, 
1·39–2·15; p<0·0001). Risk of falls increased with age, 
but was not associated with ethnic origin, physical activity, 
or baseline 25(OH)D, after adjustment for covariates 
(appendix p 3). The appendix (p 4) shows the number of 
participants reporting falls stratified by age and sex.
Non-vertebral fractures were identified in 292 (6%) of 
5108 participants during follow-up (primary fracture 
outcome), with 156 (6%) of 2558 people allocated vitamin D 
supplementation and 136 (5%) of 2550 assigned placebo 
reporting a fracture (after adjustment for age, sex, and 
ethnic origin, HR 1·15, 95% CI 0·92–1·45; after further 
adjustment for history of recent fall, physical activity, and 
baseline 25[OH]D, HR 1·19, 0·94–1·50; table 2). No 
difference in cumulative risk of fracture was noted between 
participants allocated vitamin D supplementation and those 
assigned placebo (figure 3). Addition of 13 spinal fractures 
to the 292 non-vertebral fractures, to obtain the total number 
of fractures (305 of 5108), did not change estimates by much 
(age, sex, and ethnic origin adjusted HR 1·14, 95% CI 
0·91–1·42). In the placebo group, fractures were more 
common in women than in men (80 [7%] of 1093 vs 56 [4%] 
of 1357; HR 1·77, 95% CI 1·24–2·52; p=0·002) but were 
not associated with age, ethnic origin, history of recent 
falls, physical activity, or baseline 25(OH)D, after 
adjustment for covariates (appendix p 5). Exploratory 
analyses stratifying results by baseline 25(OH)D either less 
than 25 nmol/L or greater than or equal to 75 nmol/L 
showed no heterogeneity (appendix p 6).
Discussion
Monthly supplementation of 100 000 IU colecalciferol 
(vitamin D3) taken for 2·5–4·2 years (mean 3·4 years) 
was not associated with a significant difference in risk of 
falls or fractures compared with placebo in this 
community-based 
randomised 
controlled 
trial 
in 
individuals predominantly without known osteoporosis. 
Although the statistical power of the study to detect a 
difference in fracture risk was low, no evidence was 
recorded of any reduced risk of fractures in participants 
assigned vitamin D supplementation.
The association between vitamin D deficiency and 
rickets and osteomalacia is well established, and the 
general consensus is that concentrations below 25 nmol/L 
are associated with greatly increased risk of these 
conditions.1 However, the optimum vitamin D status for 
other health outcomes is subject to debate in terms of the 
optimum concentration in blood of 25(OH)D above 
deficiency levels1,14,20 and the oral vitamin D dose needed to 
maintain particular blood concentrations of 25(OH)D 
when sun­light exposure is inadequate.
Most trials of vitamin D supplementation for 
prevention of falls or fracture have focused on groups at 
high risk of fracture—eg, women, older people, and 
institutionalised individuals (ie, those living in a nursing 
or long-term care home). Moreover, trials have been done 
in predominantly white populations. The current 
community-based trial included men, had a wide age 
range (50–84 years) of participants, and included 
different ethnic groups who have been documented to 
have a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.21
Evidence in a 2014 review did not support the 
hypothesis that supplementation with only vitamin D 
reduced the risk of falls or fractures,22 in striking contrast

to findings of previous meta-analyses. For example, with 
respect to falls, the conclusion of a 2010 meta-analysis—
based on ten studies meeting inclusion criteria—was 
that 200–1000 IU daily vitamin D reduced falls by 14% 
compared with calcium or placebo,9 a conclusion 
supported by a review in 2012 that suggested a 17% lower 
risk of falling with a median oral daily dose of 800 IU 
vitamin D.10 However, in trials published since those 
reviews, an increased falls risk with bolus vitamin D 
supplementation has been reported,23,24 leading to a more 
cautious re-evaluation highlighting the need for evidence 
in various study populations and different dosage 
regimens. Some of the differences in conclu­sions from 
overlapping meta-analyses of vitamin D supplements 
and falls have been attributed to method­ological 
variations in using data from the same trials,25 such as 
inclusion criteria and data extraction.
In terms of fractures, the 43% reduction in hip fractures 
reported in a trial of 3270 institutionalised women (ie, 
those living in a nursing or long-term care home; 
mean age 84 years) who had very low 25(OH)D levels 
consistent with osteomalacia and who were given a daily 
800 IU vitamin D and 1200 mg calcium supplement over 
18 months4 has not been observed consistently in 
subsequent trials, whether for primary or secondary 
prevention of fractures.5 A meta-analysis of such trials 
suggested a possible weak inverse association of vitamin D 
and calcium supplementation with hip fractures in 
high-risk groups, but no overall effect of vitamin D 
supplementation 
alone 
on 
fracture 
risk.26 
These 
inconsistent findings have been attributed variously to 
differences in the baseline vitamin D status of the study 
populations and the dose, frequency, and mode of 
administration of vitamin D, as well as the addition or not 
of calcium supplementation. Questions persist about 
optimum vitamin D status and the dose and frequency of 
administration of vitamin D supplementation.
In the ViDA trial, we aimed to raise concentrations in 
serum of 25(OH)D to 80–100 nmol/L, which are 
physiological concentrations recorded in young adults in 
tropical latitudes and which findings of observational 
studies suggested were optimum for health at the time 
this trial was designed.14 Findings of initial studies 
suggested that fairly high doses of vitamin D were 
needed to achieve these concentrations of 25(OH)D, and 
thus to be effective in fracture prevention. In a study 
of fracture reduction, Chapuy and colleagues4 used 
800 IU vitamin D daily; later trials in which no effects of 
vitamin D were reported on fractures—eg, the Women’s 
Health Initiative—used smaller doses of 400 IU daily.27 
In the ViDA study, the monthly bolus of 100 000 IU 
colecalciferol was equivalent to an intake of roughly 
3000 IU vitamin D a day, which is the approximate 
requirement to achieve these concentrations of 25(OH)D 
in blood when sunlight exposure is inadequate. Since 
25(OH)D has a long half-life in blood, use of a bolus for 
supplementation had perceived advantages of improving 
adherence, compared with a daily dose for several years.12 
Findings of pharmacokinetic studies indicate a peak at 
7 days after a 100 000 IU dose of vitamin D, with mean 
values declining linearly to baseline concentrations by 
84 days.13
In an early trial using 100 000 IU oral colecalciferol 
every 4 months (equivalent to about 800 IU daily), a 22% 
reduction in fractures was reported in a community-
based population of men and women older than 65 years.28 
However, later trials using large intermittent bolus doses 
reported no benefits;29 indeed, in one trial of an annual 
autumn dose of 500 000 IU vitamin D in 2256 community-
dwelling older women at high risk of fractures, a 
significantly increased risk of falls and fractures was 
reported (HR 1·15 and HR 1·26, respectively).24 Sanders 
and colleagues24 noted a temporal pattern in increased 
rates of falls in the 3 months immediately after the bolus 
and postulated that either very high levels of vitamin D 
metabolites or a subsequent decrease in concentration of 
these metabolites, or both, might be causal. In a 2016 
trial, increased falls were reported with monthly 60 000 IU 
vitamin D3 compared with monthly 24 000 IU vitamin D3, 
which accords with this finding, with the falls risk highest 
in people with the highest vitamin D levels.7 We did not 
have exit vitamin D levels for most participants in ViDA 
to enable these analyses. Findings of a review of the 
various trials to compare high-dose intermittent supple­
mentation with more frequent dosing suggested that the 
mode of administration of vitamin D resulting in an 
acute increase in concentrations in blood of 25(OH)D 
(through large oral doses) might play a part in the 
physiological effects.29
Uncertainty surrounds what the optimum amounts of 
25(OH)D might be above the suggested deficiency 
concentrations of less than 25–30 nmol/L in relation to 
various health outcomes, and these values could differ 
depending on the health outcome; thresholds might vary 
for fractures or cardiovascular disease or in different ethnic 
groups.1 For bone health, no additional benefit might be 
gained above concentrations associated with deficiency, 
and possible adverse effects could arise at high 
concentrations (>70 nmol/L), which might be associated 
with increased bone turnover. In this context, the mean 
baseline 25(OH)D concentration of this population was 
higher (61 nmol/L) than the average concentrations 
from other trial populations. In the trial by Trivedi and 
colleagues28 of 100 000 IU vitamin D every 4 months, 
fracture reduction was reported with increased concen­
trations of 25(OH)D in the vitamin D treatment group, 
from an average baseline of 53 nmol/L to 74 nmol/L. 
Although the aim of the ViDA trial was to increase 
concentrations to 80–100 nmol/L, the mean amounts 
recorded in participants allocated vitamin D supple­men­
tation were substantially higher, around 120 nmol/L on 
average, and more than twice that noted in individuals 
allocated placebo. Nevertheless, although U-shaped associ­
ations between amounts of 25(OH)D and fractures and

falls could account for the overall lack of effect on risk 
of falls and fractures (if supplementation resulted in some 
individuals having very high concentrations that might 
increase risk), we noted no differences in falls and fractures 
associated with supplementation in individuals stratified 
by baseline 25(OH)D status. Thus, even people with low 
amounts seemed to derive no fracture risk reduction from 
supplementation. Further stratification of results according 
to baseline 25(OH)D less than 25 nmol/L or at least 
75 nmol/L showed no heterogeneity and provided no 
support for the hypothesis that supplementation might be 
effective in individuals with deficiency or that increasing 
25(OH)D in people with high concentrations (≥75 nmol/L) 
might be adverse and thereby counterbalance any potential 
benefit in those with low amounts of 25(OH)D.
The ViDA trial was designed to test the effect of 
vitamin D supplementation alone, rather than in 
conjunction with calcium supplements. Although findings 
of some meta-analyses have suggested that both calcium 
and vitamin D are necessary for a benefit on fractures,1,5 
results are inconsistent and heterogeneity could be 
accounted for not only by the differing doses of vitamin D 
but also by the dose and type of calcium supplement.
The ViDA trial has several strengths. First, adherence 
was excellent. We assessed adherence in a random subset 
of participants and showed a substantial increase in 
mean blood 25(OH)D concentrations over 3 years in the 
group randomly allocated vitamin D supplementation 
compared with those assigned placebo. Second, 
ascertainment of fractures used two independent 
objective methods: hospital discharges tracked using the 
Ministry of Health unique National Health Index 
number; and the ACC system (the national governmental 
insurance organisation that covers all New Zealand 
residents for any medical and hospital costs from injury). 
Although we did not assess the sensitivity and specificity 
of the fracture data, diagnosed fractures not captured by 
these data will have been very few because both hospitals 
and family doctors have a financial incentive to claim 
from the ACC for any costs from treating injuries, 
including both inpatient and outpatient fractures. Thus, 
sensitivity is likely to be very high. Additionally, multiple 
health professionals are usually involved in the 
management of fractures (family doctors, radiologists, 
and physiotherapists at the very least). This multi­
disciplinary teamwork acts as a check against fraudulent 
ACC claims by health professionals, giving confidence 
that the specificity of the fracture data is also very high. 
Third, one of the aims of the ViDA trial was to include 
population subgroups in which data are sparse; the 
Māori and south Asian ethnic groups in New Zealand are 
at particular risk of vitamin D deficiency.21 Although 
statistical power was limited in the various subgroups, 
no evidence of heterogeneity of effect was seen in any of 
the subgroups examined.
Our study has limitations. First, the low proportion of 
people invited to participate who were randomly assigned 
limits external validity, although this shortfall is common 
for trials for which the priority is to maximise internal 
validity. Second, later on in the study, capsules were sent 
to participants every 4 months. Although no checks were 
made as to whether four capsules were taken on one 
occasion rather than monthly, participants had previously 
been taking one capsule monthly for at least 2 years, 
reminder letters were sent monthly to take one capsule, 
and no cases of hypercalcaemia were detected in the 
subset returning annually for blood tests. Third, use of 
participant self-reports to identify falls could have resulted 
in a random measurement error for this outcome, 
attenuating any effect from vitamin D. However, we used 
the standard questionnaire wording recommended for 
this outcome15 and obtained falls data every month, as 
recommended,15 for most of the follow-up period. 
Although the questionnaire was not validated in this 
population, and we were not able to verify such a large 
number of falls by follow-up phone calls, the expected 
increased risk of falls seen for female sex, older age, and 
recent history of falls (appendix p 3) support the validity 
of our measure for this outcome. Fourth, our study had 
low statistical power for fracture outcome, particularly in 
participants with vitamin D deficiency, in age and sex 
subgroups, or for fracture subsites. Although falls data 
were gathered, the falls outcome was post hoc without a 
prespecified statistical analysis plan. However, the study 
power for the falls outcome was high, even in the 
1270 participants with low vitamin D levels. Finally, we did 
not measure dietary vitamin D or calcium intake at 
baseline. However, based on findings of a national 
nutrition survey showing that New Zealanders of 
European ancestry in the study age range had a mean 
daily calcium intake of 862 mg for men and 771 mg for 
women, values that are similar to those for the European 
and North American population, it is unlikely that our 
null results are explained by inadequate intake of 
dietary calcium.
Results from the ViDA trial suggest that a monthly 
dose of 100 000 IU colecalciferol in a healthy, middle-
aged, and older ambulatory population does not reduce 
the risk of fractures or falls over 4 years. Although the 
study had low power for fracture endpoints, these 
findings—taken in conjunction with results from other 
trials—suggest that use of large monthly bolus doses of 
vitamin D does not confer overall benefit. Further study 
is needed to assess the effects of daily dosing of 
vitamin D, with or without calcium supplementation, 
and international trials are ongoing (eg, VITAL in 
the USA [NCT01169259]; DO-HEALTH in Europe 
[NCT01745263]; and FIND in Finland [NCT01463813]).
