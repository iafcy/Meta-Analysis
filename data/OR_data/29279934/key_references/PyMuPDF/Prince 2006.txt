Richard L. Prince, MD; Amanda Devine, PhD; Satvinder S. Dhaliwal, MSc; Ian M. Dick, PhD
Background: Increased dietary calcium intake has been
proposed as a population-based public health interven-
tion to prevent osteoporotic fractures. We have exam-
ined whether calcium supplementation decreases clini-
cal fracture risk in elderly women and its mechanism of
action.
Methods: Five-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled
study of 1460 women recruited from the population and
older than 70 years (mean age, 75 years) who were ran-
domized to receive calcium carbonate, 600 mg twice per
day, or identical placebo. The primary end points in-
cluded clinical incident osteoporotic fractures, verte-
bral deformity, and adverse events ascertained in 5 years.
Bone structure was also measured using dual x-ray ab-
sorptiometry of the hip and whole body, quantitative ul-
trasonography of the heel, and peripheral quantitative
computed tomography of the distal radius.
Results: Among our patients, 16.1% sustained 1 or more
clinical osteoporotic fractures. In the intention-to-treat
analysis, calcium supplementation did not significantly re-
duce fracture risk (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence in-
terval,0.67-1.12).However,830patients(56.8%)whotook
80% or more of their tablets (calcium or placebo) per year
had reduced fracture incidence in the calcium compared
with the placebo groups (10.2% vs 15.4%; hazard ratio,
0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97). Calcium-
treated patients had improved quantitative ultrasonogra-
phyfindingsoftheheel,femoralneckandwhole-bodydual
x-ray absorptiometry data, and bone strength compared
with placebo-treated patients. Of the 92000 adverse events
recorded, constipation was the only event increased by the
treatment (calcium group, 13.4%; placebo group, 9.1%).

letssupplying1200mg/disineffectiveasapublichealthin-

ECENT CLINICAL, ANIMAL,
and cell studies have con-
firmed that an important
physiological effect of es-
trogen is increased cal-
cium transport across the bowel wall and
kidney tubule.1,2 Thus, the reduction in cir-
culating estrogen concentration after
menopause results in a small daily nega-
tive calcium balance.3 This negative cal-
cium balance can be partly corrected by
increasing dietary calcium intake as dem-
onstrated by the beneficial effects of cal-
cium supplementation on bone density in
postmenopausal women.3-7 The unre-
solved critical issue for patient care is
whether the effect size is sufficient to re-
duce clinical fracture rates.
Reducing the population risk of frac-
ture is likely to require a public health in-
tervention for all in addition to treatment
of high-risk individuals with pharmaceu-
tical intervention.8 Therefore, the cur-
rent study was planned as a study of cal-
cium supplementation in a relatively
healthy, vitamin D–sufficient, and ambu-
latory elderly population in which the
whole population rather than those with
low bone mass were studied. The study
also examines the biochemical and struc-
tural effects of calcium supplementation
to provide an understanding of the mecha-
nism of the effect on fracture reduction.
METHODS
PATIENTS
We recruited 1460 women during 1 year using
a population-based approach in which a ran-
dom selection of women (n=24 800) older than
70 years on the electoral roll in Western Aus-
tralia received a letter inviting them to join the
study. Of these, 4312 individuals responded and
were contacted by telephone (Figure 1). More
than 98% of women of this age are on the elec-
toral roll (n=33 366). Although the patients en-
tering the study were weighted in favor of those

den and pharmaceutical consumption were similar to data ob-
tained from whole populations of this age.9 Informed consent
was obtained, and the Human Rights Committee of the Univer-
sity of Western Australia, Perth, Australia, approved the study.
BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS
A prevalent fracture was recorded if it occurred after the age of
50 years, was due to minimal trauma as defined by falling from
a height of less than 1 m, and was not of the face, skull, or pha-
langes (Table 1). The number of years since menopause was
calculated for each patient using reported age at last men-
strual period, hysterectomy and ovariectomy, or onset of hot
flushes. A positive smoking history was reported if at least 1
cigarette per day had been smoked for 3 months or longer at
any time. Daily intake of protein, calcium, and alcohol was de-
termined from a self-administered semiquantitative food fre-
quency questionnaire.10,11
CLINICAL MEASUREMENTS
Grip strength of the dominant hand was recorded as the highest
of 3 attempts12 using a handheld dynamometer (Hand Grip Dy-
namometer; TEC, Clifton, NJ). Body mass index was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
Activity levels were calculated in kilocalories per day using
a validated method13 that combines body weight, answers to
questions on the number of hours and type of physical activ-
ity, and energy costs of such activities,14,15 with a response of
no to the activity questions resulting in a 0 score.
Mobility functioning was measured by the timed Up & Go
test, which required that patients be timed while getting up,
walking 3 m, turning, returning to the chair, and sitting down
again.16 Results of the standing Rhomberg Balance Test17 were
classified as to whether the patient was able to maintain a tan-
dem stance for at least 10 seconds.
BONE MEASUREMENTS
Calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) measurements
of the left foot were obtained using an ultrasound densitom-
eter (Lunar Achilles; GE Lunar Corp, Madison, Wis) at base-
line and 5 years; the coefficients of variation (CV) for speed of
sound and broadband ultrasound attenuation were 0.43% and
1.59%, respectively. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone den-
sity was measured at the hip and whole body on a fan-beam
densitometer (Hologic Acclaim 4500A; Hologic Corp, Waltham,
Mass) at 1 and 5 years. The CVs at the total hip, femoral neck,
and whole body were 1.2%, 1.4%, and 0.8%, respectively.18 Pe-
ripheral quantitative computed tomography bone structure and
density were measured in the radius at a site 4% of the length
of the radius distal to the wrist joint, using a peripheral quan-
titative computed tomography device (XCT-2000; StraTec
Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). The voxel size
was set at 150 µm in the x and y directions and 1000 µm in the
z direction. The CVs for trabecular and cortical bone mineral
density were 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The cross-sectional
area of cortical bone was measured using a threshold of peri-
osteal and endosteal bone density of 710 and 169 mg/cm3, re-
spectively. The Stress Strain Index was calculated as the prod-
uct of the section modulus and cortical density normalized to
the maximal physiological cortical density of human bones (1200
mg/cm3) for the polar moment and the bending moments in
the x and y directions, where the y direction is the widest part
of the radius and the x direction is perpendicular to this.19
BIOCHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS
Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was measured
using an immunochemiluminometric method with intra-
assay and interassay CVs of 3.6% and 6.2%, respectively.20 Total
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was measured using an ex-
traction technique, followed by a competitive binding assay us-
ing diluted human serum that measures 25-hydroxycholecal-
ciferolandergocalciferollevelsequally.Intra-assayandinterassay
CVs were 8% and 16%, respectively.21
RANDOMIZATION TO STUDY TREATMENT
AND COMPLIANCE
Patients received calcium carbonate tablets, 600 mg twice per
day (with morning and evening meals), or identical placebo tab-
lets (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, Baulkham Hills, Australia).
The randomization list was produced by generating 150 blocks
of 10 numbers. In each block, 5 positions representing placebo
and 5 positions representing calcium treatment were ordered us-
ing a letter code according to a random number generator. The
numbered blocks were ordered according to randomly gener-
ated numbers, and an identification number was assigned in or-
der to each letter code in the randomized list. The Pharmacy De-
partmentoftheSirCharlesGairdnerHospital,Nedlands,Australia,
assigned a treatment to the letter code and assigned the appro-
priate medications to the patient according to this list. The ran-
domization was stratified by allocating patients to blocks ac-
cording to whether a prevalent nontraumatic fracture had
occurred after age 50 years, ensuring that an equal number of
patients with and without a prevalent fracture received placebo
or calcium. Medication compliance was checked by counting re-
turned tablets at each 12-month review and was calculated as a
percentage of the optimum. Average yearly compliance of less
than 80% was classified as noncompliant.
INCIDENT FRACTURES AND ADVERSE EVENTS
Adverse events resulting in attendance to a health care profes-
sional were recorded in a diary at 4-month intervals and coded
using the International Classification of Primary Care, Ver-
sion 2-Plus, system database of disease coding (Family Medi-
cine Research Unit, Department of General Practice, Univer-
sity of Sydney, Sydney, Australia). Adverse events were grouped
according to 17 categories identified by the International Clas-
sification of Primary Care, Version 2-Plus, system.22 Atrau-

matic incident clinical fractures and atraumatic symptomatic
vertebral fractures were reported in the diary. The diagnosis
and classification of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were
confirmed by radiographic reports.
Vertebral deformities were assessed using morphometric
x-ray absorptiometry software on a densitometer (software ver-
sion 9.1, Hologic 4500A; Hologic Corp) at years 1 and 5. The
positions of 6 reference markers for each vertebra were placed
at the corners and in the middle of the upper and lower surface
of each vertebra. The mean CVs in morphometric x-ray absorp-
tiometry measurements of the anterior, middle, and posterior
heights of vertebrae varied from 5.8% at T6 to 3.1% at L4. Ver-
tebral heights reference data and values for deformities were cal-
culated according to a modification of the procedure described
by McCloskey et al.23 Incident vertebral deformities were de-
fined as vertebral deformities not present at year 1, with a re-
duction in posterior, middle, or anterior heights of 20% or more.
STATISTICS AND POWER CALCULATIONS
Statistical procedures were performed with SPSSPC for Win-
dows version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). The time to first
clinical event was analyzed using the Cox proportional haz-
ards model with and without adjustment for covariates. Dif-
ferences between normally distributed characteristics of the treat-
ment groups were determined by univariate analysis of variance
with adjustments for covariates. The Mann-Whitney test was
used to determine the differences between the groups for non-
normally distributed variables. All statistical tests were 2-tailed,
and P.05 was considered significant.
Power calculations were conducted before study commence-
ment, assuming a fracture rate of 3.5% per year in the placebo
group and assuming that calcium would reduce the event rate
by 35%. At a power of at least 80%, at an  of .05, and allowing
for a 30% noncompliance rate during the 5-year study, recruit-
ment of 737 patients per group was required.
RESULTS
Patient recruitment for the study and their final categori-
zation is shown in Figure 1. Of the 1222 women ex-
cluded, 977 (80.0%) were taking medications that could
affect bone mass, 199 (16.3%) had medical conditions that

44 (3.6%) were participating in another clinical trial, and
2 (0.2%) were not prepared to be assigned to the placebo.
Another 1580 individuals were not interested. Therefore,
1510 women were eligible for the study, of whom the first
1460 were recruited. There were no differences in base-
line demographic characteristics between the placebo and
calcium groups. In a randomly selected subset of patients
(n=81), 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were generally above
the deficient range because only 6.1% (during winter) and
2.8% (during summer) of patients had vitamin D concen-
trations below 12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L) (mean±SD win-
ter level, 27±14 ng/mL [67±35 nmol/L]; mean±SD sum-
mer level, 35±12 ng/mL [87±30 nmol/L]). No PTH
concentrations were above the upper limit of the refer-
ence range (mean±SD winter level, 37±11 pg/mL;
mean±SD summer level, 37±11 pg/mL; n=81).
The risks of withdrawal and death were the same in
the calcium group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.63 -1.16) compared with the pla-
cebo group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.47-1.23) (Figure 1).
Eight hundred thirty patients (56.8%) complied with the
medication regimen throughout the study, with no sig-
nificant difference in compliance failure in the calcium
group (310 patients) compared with the placebo group
(320 patients) (2=0.28; P=.60). Compared with com-
pliant patients, noncompliant persons were slightly older,
weaker, and slower and had lower QUS measures
(Table 1), but there were no differences related to the
original randomization to calcium or placebo.
INCIDENT FRACTURE
Table 2 and Figure 2 show the fracture outcomes. A
total of 236 individuals (16.2%) sustained 297 incident
osteoporotic fractures. The intention-to-treat analysis did
notdemonstrateaneffectofcalciumtoreducefracturerisk,
recorded as time to first fracture at any site (HR, 0.87; 95%
CI, 0.67-1.12), time to first fracture of the appendicular
skeleton (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65-1.18), time to first ver-
tebral fracture (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63-1.54), or incident
morphometric x-ray absorptiometry vertebral deformity.
A preplanned per protocol analysis restricted to the
830 patients (56.8%) who consumed 80% of tablets
(Figure 2 and Table 2) demonstrated a reduction in all-
site clinical fractures (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97), ap-
pendicular fractures (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.97), and
upper limb fractures (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92) in
the calcium group before and after adjustment for age,
body mass index, and prevalent baseline fracture en-
tered as covariates. Baseline dietary calcium intake did
not influence any of the HRs obtained. Although analy-
sis of the baseline structural assessment of the skeleton
using heel QUS (broadband ultrasound attenuation or
speed of sound) adjusted for treatment status showed that
individuals with higher measurements had reduced in-
cident fracture risk (HR per 1-SD increase in speed of
sound, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.77; HR per 1-SD increase
in broadband ultrasound attenuation, 0.70; 95% CI 0.61-
0.80), the addition of baseline QUS bone structural mea-
sures did not substantially alter any of the fracture HRs
examined.
An analysis of fractures in the noncompliant popula-
tion showed no difference in the number or type of frac-
tures sustained between placebo- and calcium-treated
patients.
BONE STRUCTURE AND BIOCHEMISTRY
There was no difference in any bone factors between cal-
cium- and placebo-treated patients at baseline (QUS) and
1 year (DXA) (Table 1). The changes in bone structure
are shown in Figure 3. The QUS measurements from
baseline to 5 years, adjusted for body mass index, age,
and tablet compliance, show significant improvement in
calcium-treated patients for broadband ultrasound at-
tenuation and stiffness, but not speed of sound. A reduc-
tion in the loss of bone content and area but not bone
mineral density was seen at the femoral neck and whole-

Strain Index in the x and y directions.
The PTH level decreased from baseline to year 5 (107
placebo- and 103 calcium-treated patients) in the calcium
compared with the placebo group (mean ± SD change,
−8.9±13.2 and −2.0±13.2 pg/mL, respectively; P.001).
ADVERSE EVENTS
Of the 92 000 adverse events recorded, only constipa-
tion was higher in the calcium group (13.4%) compared
with the placebo group (9.1%), with no difference be-
tween groups in the percentage of patients who stopped
study medication therapy because of constipation. Two
patients in each treatment group had kidney stones dur-
ing the study. Incident ischemic heart disease was diag-
nosed in 56 patients (7.7%) in the calcium group and in
51 patients (7.0%) in the placebo group, with no differ-
ence in the relative risk for the calcium compared with
placebo group (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.77-1.64).
COMMENT
The patients recruited for the study were representative of
non–vitaminD–deficientambulatorywomenolderthan70
years who have a 5-year risk of fracture greater than 15%.
The principal finding was that randomization to a cal-
cium supplement for 5 years failed to show a significant
preventive effect on fracture, with results similar to those
of a previous meta-analysis24 of a number of small studies
of appendicular fracture (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-
1.12) and a recently reported study25 of patients with a pre-
vious fracture (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.09). They are di-
vergent from previous reports26,27 of beneficial effects of
combined calcium and cholecalciferol (vitamin D) treat-
ment in patients who may have been vitamin D deficient
and studies28,29 showing a reduction in spine fracture with
calcium supplementation in osteoporotic patients.
The lack of significance of calcium therapy in the in-
tention-to-treat analysis is likely due to the lack of com-
pliance with the medication regimen, which in the power
calculation before commencement of the study was pre-
dicted to be 30%, but was in fact 43%. This is a limitation
of the study but reflects the difficulties of implementa-
tion of preventive health practice in all such studies. An-
other possible cause for this relative lack of efficacy may
be that the vitamin D status of the population, although
substantially better than that encountered in studies in
higher latitudes, may have been insufficient to allow op-
timal absorption and disposal of calcium to the skeleton.
Intheper-protocolanalysisofthe56.8%ofpatientswho
took 80% or more of their assigned medication, the risk
of any clinical osteoporotic fracture was reduced by a fac-
tor of 0.34 (absolute risk reduction, 15.4%-10.2%). The
maintenance of or improvement in QUS and DXA mea-
sures with calcium supplementation supports an effect to
improve bone mass and possibly architecture. The periph-
eral quantitative computed tomography data showed that
the effect of calcium was principally to maintain cortical
bone in the endocortical area. At the radial site, it was pos-
sible to demonstrate an increase in cortical volume and
therefore mass and calculated resistance to torsional and
bending forces by calcium, an expected result of in-
creased cortical bone mass. The lack of effect on trabec-
ular bone density was surprising but may relate to a sub-
stantiallydamagedtrabecularstructureintheseindividuals
or a site-specific effect of reduced bone resorption via ef-
fects on reducing the PTH level.5 This was supported by

cant modifying effect of baseline bone structure. To date,
studies of the effectiveness of pharmacologic agents other
than hormone replacement therapy30 in reducing frac-
ture rates has been restricted to high-risk populations with
low DXA bone mineral density.31 When patients have not
been selected on the basis of low DXA bone mass density,
no hip fracture reduction has been found.32

Theanalysisoffractureratesinthenoncompliantpatients
showednodifferenceinriskoffracturerelatedtotreatment
group, thus making it unlikely that patients had become
noncompliant owing to treatment status.
Because it is important for a public health interven-
tion to be safe, we conducted a careful evaluation of ad-
verse events. Our evaluation showed that, although con-
stipation increased with calcium treatment, the risk of
kidney stones, ischemic heart disease, or other adverse
events was not increased.
In conclusion, the calcium supplementation regimen
tested currently cannot be recommended as a public health
approach to fracture prevention because of the lack of
long-term compliance. These data should give pause to
those who consider that public health policy in this area
should be based on epidemiological or surrogate end-
point data. However, these data support the continued
use of calcium supplements by women who are able to
remain compliant with their use. In these individuals, es-
pecially if they are under the care of a clinician, calcium
supplementation is a safe and effective therapy for re-
ducing the risk of osteoporotic fracture.
