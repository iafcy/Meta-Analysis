ABSTRACT
Dietary supplements that prevent bone loss at the hip and that can
be applied safely in the elderly are likely to reduce hip fractures. A
daily dietary supplement of 750 mg calcium or 15 mg 25OH vitamin
D3 on bone loss at the hip and other sites, bone turnover and calcium-
regulating hormones were studied over 4 yr in elderly volunteers
using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Bone min-
eral density (BMD) was measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry and
bone structure by radiographs. Calcium biochemistry and bone turn-
over markers were measured in blood and urine. The 316 women
entering the trial had a mean age of 73.7 yr and the 122 men of 75.9
yr. Baseline median calcium intake was 546 mg/day, and median
serum 25OH vitamin D3 was 59 nmol/L. On placebo, loss of BMD at
total hip was 2% and femoral medulla expansion was 3% over 4 yr.
Calcium reduced bone loss, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and bone
turnover. 25OH vitamin D3 was intermediate between placebo and
calcium. Fracture rates and drop-out rates were similar among
groups, and there were no serious adverse events with either sup-
plement. A calcium supplement of 750 mg/day prevents loss of BMD,
reduces femoral medullary expansion, secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism, and high bone turnover. A supplement of 15 mg/day 25OH vi-
tamin D3 is less effective, and because its effects are seen only at low
calcium intakes, suggests that its beneficial effect is to reverse cal-
cium insufficiency. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 85: 3011–3019, 2000)
A
GE-RELATED HIP fracture is common in both men and
women (1). The fracture is a stochastic event arising
from the interaction between recurrent minor trauma usually
from falls and decreased bone strength at the hip (2, 3). In the
reduction of bone strength that occurs with age, both low
calcium intake (4, 5) and low vitamin D stores (6) have been
implicated. Dietary intake of calcium decreases with age (7),
and a substantial proportion of the elderly take less than the
Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 mg (8). There is also
an age-related reduction in vitamin D status, a major deter-
minant of calcium absorption (9). Thus, dietary supplemen-
tation with calcium and/or with vitamin D would seem to
be an important health measure in hip fracture prevention.
This is, in part, embodied in the Institute of Medicine’s
recent recommendations (10) that in men and women over
the age of 70 yr daily Adequate Intakes would be 1200 mg
calcium and 15 mg (600 IU) vitamin D. However, these rec-
ommendations are largely based on studies in younger post-
menopausal women. Furthermore, the recommendations do
not address the possible interaction between calcium intake
and vitamin D status.
The age-related decrease in bone strength at the hip is
largely due to a reduction in bone mineral density (BMD)
(11–15). But changes in bone structure (16, 17), and perhaps
bone turnover (18), also contribute. A number of mechanisms
have been implicated in age-related bone loss at the hip.
Perhaps the most common biochemical abnormalities con-
sidered to be responsible for bone loss are an increase in
secondary hyperparathyroidism and in bone turnover
(19, 20).
A number of studies of vitamin D and calcium supple-
mentation on femoral BMD (21) and fracture (22, 23) have
shown positive effects. However, because of the study de-
sign, it is not clear how much of the benefit was due to
supplementation with vitamin D or with calcium. Thus, the
aims of this study were to study the effect on bone mass and
structure at the hip and on bone turnover of maintaining
dietary calcium and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D concen-
trations in the upper end of the normal ranges in a sample
of men and women over the age of 60.
Patients and Methods
Subjects
Women (n 5 316) and men (n 5 122) aged 60 and over were entered
into a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial on the effect
of a daily dietary supplement of 750 mg calcium or 15 mg 25OH vitamin
D3 on bone mass and structure at the upper end of the femur. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Indiana Uni-
versity School of Medicine. Minorities were not excluded, but all subjects
were white and were recruited by advertisements and contact through
organizations for retirees from two retirement homes in Franklin, In-
diana, and from the town of Franklin and its immediate neighborhood.
Over 60% were free-living, and all were independently mobile, able to
give informed consent as assessed by the Short Portable Mental Status
Test and willing to undertake a 4-yr study. Subjects were excluded if they
had a terminal illness; Paget’s disease of bone; recurrent urinary stone
disease; had been treated with sodium fluoride, bisphosphonate, ste-
roids, or dilantin; had renal disease requiring specific treatment; or were
excluded by their primary physician. Low BMD, previous skeletal frac-
ture, and estrogen replacement therapy were not reasons for exclusion.

Study design
The study was designed as a double-blind, controlled-trial comparing
a calcium supplement and a supplement of 25OH vitamin D3 with
appropriate placebos. After baseline studies, subjects were randomized
to 1 of 16 strata by age (60–74 and $75), sex, serum 25OH vitamin D
concentration (,60 nmol/L and $60 nmol/L), and dietary calcium
intake (,480 mg/day and $480 mg/day), which from previous studies
were estimated to be close to the medians for this population. Assess-
ment of dietary calcium intake was available within 24 h and serum
25OH vitamin D concentration within 2 weeks of the baseline visit and
did not delay randomization into the study. Subjects were randomized
into the study over a 17-month period. Subjects were seen every 6
months and had BMD measured, blood and urine collected, and ques-
tionnaire data gathered. Radiographs were performed every 12 months.
At each clinic visit, fresh supplement and placebo were supplied, and
returned tablets and capsules were recorded. At each visit a diary of
fractures was collected, food frequency questionnaires entered into the
dietary database, and prescription and nonprescription medications
recorded.
Medication
Calcium supplement was given as calcium citrate malate (Procter and
Gamble, Cincinnati, OH). Tablets containing 250 mg elemental calcium
or placebo and capsules containing 5 mg 25OH vitamin D3 or placebo
(Bone Care) were taken three times per day with meals. The 25OH
vitamin D3 content of the capsules was analyzed every 6 months, and
there was no significant decrease seen over the 4 yr of study. Placebos
were of the same shape, color, and consistency as the active
supplements.
Methods
Bone mass. BMD of the right hip was measured by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). After subject repositioning
the measurements were repeated. The coefficient of variation of BMD at
the total hip was 2.13% and at femoral neck was 2.52% (17). Where there
was a history of fracture or replacement by a prosthesis on the right (n 5
13), the left hip was measured. Data were acquired with Lunar Software
version 1.2, and analysis was performed using software version 4.1,
which provides measurements at total hip, shaft, femoral neck, Ward’s
triangle, and greater trochanter. All scans were analyzed using the auto
search mode. BMD of the lumbar spine in the anteroposterior position
and total body were also measured, but not in duplicate. Quality control
was monitored using an external spine phantom.
Bone structure. Radiographs of the lower pelvis to include both upper
femurs in 15-degree internal rotation were taken on standard x-ray
equipment using a focal distance of 101.6 cm. All measurements were
made on the same hip as that measured by DXA. The width of the femur
and the medulla at the mid shaft were measured directly from radio-
graphs by one observer using a Digimatic Caliper (Mitutoyo) as de-
scribed previously (17). The coefficient of variation (CV) of femur shaft
width was 0.58% and femur medulla width was 1.96% (17).
Blood and urine biochemistry. A 24-h urine and blood and urine taken after
an overnight fast were collected at each visit. Calcium and creatinine (Cr)
were measured in all urines, and cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I
collagen (NTX) in all fasting urines. Serums from all visits were mea-
sured for calcium, Cr, intact PTH, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, 25OH vitamin
D, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. In addition, hematology and
biochemistry for monitoring safety were measured at each visit. All
serum samples were subaliqoted after allowing the blood to clot and
stored at 270 C until assayed. All urine was subaliqoted and stored at
230 C until assayed.
Serum osteocalcin was measured by RIA using a rabbit polyclonal
antiserum raised against bovine osteocalcin (24). The interassay CV is
11.0% at a serum concentration of 3.9 ng/mL with a normal range of
4–19 ng/100 mL.
NTX in urine was measured by an enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant
assay using a monoclonal antibody to human NTX (Ostex International).
The interassay CV is 12.6% at a concentration of 124 nm/mm bone
collagen equivalents with a normal range for NTX/Cr of 2–89 nm/mm.
Serum intact PTH was measured by a double antibody method (Nichols
Institute). The interassay CV is 9.8% at a serum concentration of 17.5
pg/mL, with a normal range of 10–65 pg/mL.
Serum 25OH vitamin D was assayed using the vitamin D-binding
protein from rat serum and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D was assayed using the
vitamin D receptor protein from calf thymus after extraction from serum
and purification on HPLC. The interassay CV for 25OH vitamin D is
10.3% at a serum concentration of 30.3 nmol/L and for 1,25(OH)2 vi-
tamin D is 10.4% at a serum concentration of 63.4 pmol/L.
Serum calcium (CV 5 2.2% at 2.4 mmol%), urine calcium (CV 5 2.2%
at 3.9 mmol%), and serum Cr (CV 5 2.0% at .4 mmol%) and urine Cr
(2.8% at 8.3 mmol%) were measured by standard methods on a Roche
autoanalyzer.
Fractures. Lifetime history of fracture was obtained at the first visit. Each
subject kept a diary of fractures. At each visit fractures were recorded
along with the type of trauma responsible, whether the fracture was
confirmed by radiography and whether it required splinting or surgery.
The occurrence of vertebral fractures from L4 to T4 was assessed from
lateral thoracic and lumbar radiographs taken at the first and last visit
for each subject. A fracture was defined as a reduction of the anterior
vertebral height of 20% or greater (25).
Diet history. The prevailing dietary calcium intake was assessed at each
visit by the National Cancer Institute Health, Habits, and History (26).
Statistics and analysis
Descriptive statistics for all variables were calculated. The three
groups were compared at baseline to evaluate the success of the ran-
domization. Because the BMD at total hip showed the lowest variance,
the primary outcome of the study was the change in total hip BMD from
baseline to 48 months using an intent-to-treat analysis. If no measure-
ment was made at 48 months, the last observation was carried forward.
The change in BMD was compared using ANOVA. The differences from
baseline were used as the outcomes for this analysis, allowing for treat-
ment and visit effects and their interactions. The data were also analyzed
using repeated measures ANOVA, which accounted for the correlation
over time within a subject. In this analysis, the missing data were as-
sumed to occur at random. To allow for the possibility that the subject’s
probability of dropout was related to her/his true BMD, the repeated-
measures analysis was extended to include modeling the probability of
dropout (27, 28). The results of this analysis did not differ from the
primary analysis described above. Interactions between calcium and
vitamin D were examined by splitting the sample into high and low
calcium intake groups at the median calcium intake and using analysis
of covariance to examine for differences in the slopes of serum 25OH
vitamin D as a predictor of total hip BMD, serum calcium, and serum
PTH. A similar analysis was performed by splitting at the median serum
25OH vitamin D level and using calcium intake as the predictor. The
proportions of subjects who had vertebral or non-vertebral fractures
were compared among groups using a x2 test.
Results
Baseline variables (Table 1)
Baseline variables were calculated for the 282 women and
111 men who had at least one BMD at femoral neck, total hip,
spine, or total body measured after baseline. Compared to
women, men in this study were taller, heavier, and older, had
a higher dietary calcium intake, BMD, width of femur me-
dulla and cortex, serum Cr, 24-h urine calcium, Cr clearance
and lower serum calcium, PTH, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, bone
turnover markers, and fasting urine calcium/Cr ratio. The
percentage of subjects above the normal range for serum
PTH was 8%, for serum osteocalcin 11%, and for fasting urine
NTX/Cr 5%.
BMD changes (Tables 2 and 3 and Fig. 1)
There were no significant sex main-effects or sex-by-
treatment interactions in any of the variables, and, hence,

men and women were combined in the analyses. Using an
intent-to-treat analysis, the placebo group lost BMD at
total hip; the calcium group did not lose BMD; and the loss
of BMD in the 25OH vitamin D group was intermediate
(Table 2). The overall treatment effect in the primary anal-
ysis was significant (P 5 0.017). The results of repeated-
measures analysis using all available data (Fig. 1) and
analysis of those subjects who completed 48 months of
study (Table 3) were very similar to those observed in the
primary intent-to-treat analysis (Table 2). The placebo
group lost BMD at the total hip at a rate of about 0.5% per
year (P , 0.001) (Table 3 and Fig. 1). The change in BMD
at total hip in the calcium group was significantly different
from that in the placebo group (P , 0.008), but not from
the 25OH vitamin D3 group. The change in BMD in the
25OH vitamin D3 group was intermediate between the
calcium and the placebo group, but it was not significantly
different from either. Although the change in BMD con-
tinued to diverge among groups up to 4 y (Fig. 1), a
significant interaction was not detected. The changes at
femoral neck, greater trochanter, and Wards triangle were
similar to that at the total hip (data not shown). The effects
at total body were similar to that at the hip (Fig. 1 and Table
3). However, at the spine all groups increased BMD during
the study, with the change in the calcium group being

higher than the groups on placebo (P , 0.02) and 25OH
vitamin D3 (P , 0.04) (Fig. 1 and Table 3).
Femoral structure (Table 3 and Fig. 2)
The increase in medullary width in the placebo group was
significantly greater than in the calcium (P , 0.002) and
25OH vitamin D (P , 0.03) groups. There was no significant
treatment effect on total femur width. Thus, the overall effect
was a decrease in cortical thickness of the femoral shaft over
4 yr in the placebo group (P , 0.007) (data not shown).
Calcium-regulating hormones (Fig. 3)
There was no difference in serum PTH between the cal-
cium and the 25OH vitamin D3 group, and both were sig-
nificantly different from placebo (P , 0.001). Change in se-
rum 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D in the calcium group was
significantly greater than in the placebo (P , 0.001) and
25OH vitamin D3 group (P , 0.002), and there was no dif-
ference between placebo and 25OH vitamin D3 group. The
24-h urine calcium to Cr ratio increased in the calcium group
more than the 25OH vitamin D3 group (P , 0.06), which in
turn increased more than the placebo (P , 0.07). The effects
on the fasting urine calcium to Cr ratio were similar but less
marked (data not shown). These results were similar whether
groups were examined with those who remained in the study
for the 4 yr or who dropped out over the 4-yr period.
Biomarkers (Fig. 4)
Serum osteocalcin was different between the calcium and
both the 25OH vitamin D3 (P , 0.001) and placebo groups
(P , 0.008). Urine NTX/Cr in the calcium group remained
lower than both the placebo (P , 0.002) and 25OH vitamin
D3 (P , 0.02) groups.
Calcium intake and vitamin D status interaction (Fig. 5)
In subjects with calcium intakes less than the median in-
take during the study of 716 mg/day, there was a positive
relationship between serum 25OH vitamin D and the change
in total hip BMD (P , 0.06) and serum calcium (P , 0.03) and
a negative relationship with the change in serum PTH (P ,
0.001). In subjects with calcium intakes greater than the me-
dian, these relationships were absent and significantly dif-
ferent for BMD (P , 0.007) and PTH (P , 0.001) from those
on the lower calcium intake. Similarly, analysis of the rela-
tionship between calcium intake and bone loss at the hip
above and below the median serum 25OH vitamin D con-
centration showed that at the lower vitamin D status the

total body (c) with years on supplement (mean and 1 SE). Calcium was
different from placebo at the hip (P , 0.008), the spine (P , 0.02), and
at the total body (P , 0.08). 25OH vitamin D3 and placebo did not
differ.

slope between calcium and BMD at the hip was more positive
than at the higher vitamin D status (P , 0.06).
Fractures (Table 4)
The number of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures oc-
curring in the calcium and 25OH vitamin D3 supplement
groups and in the placebo group did not significantly differ
(P 5 0.680).
Supplementation and dropout
The 25OH vitamin D3, supplement increased the mean
serum 25OH vitamin D from 60.5 nmol/L to 118.8 nmol/L
at 12 months, which remained close to this value throughout
the remainder of the study. Only 10 subjects had serum 25OH
vitamin D less than 97.5 nmol/L, and none had values higher
than 250 nmol/L. The median dietary calcium intake at base-
line was 546 mg/day. In an individual dietary calcium intake
remained fairly constant (within person sd 5 175 mg/day),
and the median intake for each group did not change
significantly over the study period. Compliance was 80%
(sd 5 20%) for the calcium supplement, 89% (sd 5 16%) for
the 25OH vitamin D3 supplement, and 85% (sd 5 19%)
for the placebo. The number of subjects who failed to com-
plete the 4-yr study was not significantly different in the
three groups, but was lowest in the placebo. Of the 437
subjects randomized to the study, 352 completed 1 yr, 297
completed 2 yr, 271 completed 3 yr, and 236 completed 4 yr.
66% of the men and 59% of the women completed the 4 yr.
The number of subjects who dropped out in the calcium
group (n 5 71) and the 25OH vitamin D group (n 5 69) were
higher, but not significantly so (P 5 0.48) than in the placebo
group (n 5 61). Early withdrawal due to death (n 5 20),
fracture (n 5 9), concurrent illness (n 5 47), subject request
(n 5 119), and increasing serum Cr (n 5 6) were not different
in the three groups. Gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly con-
stipation, caused 12 subjects to drop out, and 10 of these were
taking the calcium supplement. One subject taking calcium
developed a kidney stone, one developed primary hyper-
parathyroidism, and one on placebo developed hypercalce-
mia. All patients who dropped out were encouraged to re-
turn for follow-up visits.

(P , 0.001), but not from each other. 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D decreased
on calcium more than on 25OH vitamin D3 (P , 0.002) and placebo
(P , 0.001). Twenty-four-h urine calcium on calcium was higher than
on 25OH vitamin D3 (P , 0.06) and on placebo (P , 0.001) and 25OH
vitamin D3 was different from placebo (P , 0.07). A 24-h urine was
not collected on study at the fourth year visit.

Safety biochemistry
The change in serum Cr concentration was not signifi-
cantly different among placebo, calcium and 25OH vitamin
D3 groups over the 4-yr study. Urinary calcium increased in
the calcium supplement group (P , 0.001) and the 25OH
vitamin D3 group (P , 0.05). There was no episode of con-
sistent (i.e. remaining high on a repeated collection) hyper-
calciuria defined by a fasting urine Ca/Cr above 0.99 (mm/
mm) and a 24-h urine calcium above 7.5 mmol in women and
8.7 mmol in men.
Discussion
The beneficial effects of calcium supplementation in pre-
venting loss of BMD at the proximal femur in men and
women over the age of 60 yr in this study were corroborated
by positive effects on BMD at total body and lumbar spine.
Importantly, beneficial effects also occurred in the structure
of the femur. The age-related expansion of the femoral med-
ullary cavity was slowed, resulting in a reduction in the loss
of cortical bone. Thus, two important components of bone
strength at the hip, BMD, and cortical thickness were pre-
served with calcium supplementation. These beneficial ef-
fects on the proximal femur support the results of several
intervention trials in elderly women using calcium supple-
ments alone. Dawson-Hughes et al. (29) found that a 500-
mg/day calcium supplement reduced the rate of bone loss at
the hip in women whose dietary calcium intake was less than
400 mg/day; Reid et al. (30) found that a 1000-mg/day cal-
cium supplement had a significant treatment effect at the hip;
and Riggs et al. (31) found that a calcium supplement of 1600
mg/day had a beneficial effect on hip BMD. In our study, as
in the trial of Riggs et al. (31), the beneficial effects on bone
were associated with a reduction in serum PTH and in bi-
omarkers of bone turnover, strongly suggesting that subjects
were calcium insufficient at base line (32). Half of our study
population had a daily dietary intake less than 540 mg/day,
which is typical of this age group (7). The amount of calcium
supplement provided in this study was 750 mg/day, an
amount that increased the calcium intake of our subjects
above the median of 540 mg/day without increasing it be-
yond the upper end of the normal range. In general, the
calcium supplement was well tolerated, with gastrointestinal
upset being the only common complaint.
Supplementation with oral 25OH vitamin D3 had only a
marginal benefit on bone loss. The 25OH vitamin D3 sup-
plement decreased serum PTH to about the same degree as
the calcium supplement, but, in contrast, it had little effect on
bone turnover. About 50% of our subjects were in the vitamin
D insufficiency range at baseline, with the median serum
25OH vitamin D being 59 nmol/L (32). Oral 25 hydroxy
vitamin D3, 15 mcg/day, increased serum 25OH vitamin D
concentration into the upper half of the elderly normal range.
The mean increase was 58 nmol/L, an increase expected with
a supplement of oral vitamin D3 of about 800 IU/day (33, 34).
A vitamin D supplement given without calcium supplemen-
tation has been shown in the elderly to have beneficial effects
on bone mass in some studies. Nordin et al. (35) found that
15,000 IU vitamin D2/week reduced the loss of metacarpal
cortical thickness in elderly women; in women supple-
mented with 400 IU vitamin D3/day, Dawson-Hughes et al.
(33) found that seasonal changes in spine BMD were less than
women on placebo, which resulted in overall benefit to the
skeleton; and Ooms et al. (34) found that 400 IU vitamin
D3/day over a 2-yr period in women prevented bone loss at
the femoral neck. In the latter two studies, the vitamin D
supplement reduced serum PTH concentration, but as in our
study, had no effect on bone turnover markers.
In subjects on placebo, BMD decreased, cortical bone
thinned, secondary hyperparathyroidism progressed, and
high bone turnover increased. The rate of bone loss at the hip
was over 0.5%/yr, a rate similar to those found in popula-
tion-based studies (13–15). BMD at total body also decreased,
but at the spine it increased by about 0.1%/yr. The increase
at spine in subjects over the age of 60 is generally considered
to be due to a rise in the incidence and severity of spinal
osteoarthritis and not to an increase in BMD of vertebral bone
(36, 37). Consistent with the observation that the skeleton
expands with age (38), femoral width increased. However,

supplement (mean and 1 SE). Osteocalcin change on calcium differed from 25OH vitamin D3 (P , 0.01) and placebo (P , 0.05). NTX/Cr change
on calcium was lower than 25OH vitamin D3 (P , 0.02) and placebo (P , 0.002). 25OH vitamin D3 and placebo did not differ.

the medullary cavity expanded more rapidly at over 0.5%/
yr, which resulted in an overall decrease in cortical thickness.
At baseline, there was secondary hyperparathyroidism
and increased turnover. Both calcium and 25OH vitamin D3
reversed the secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, cal-
cium had a much greater effect on bone turnover and calcium
excretion, suggesting that the beneficial effects of calcium are
due not only to suppression of secondary hyperparathyroid-
ism but also to the increased supply of calcium to bone.
A number of trials of calcium combined with vitamin D
supplementation on bone mass (21, 22, 39) and on fracture
(22, 23) have been reported. From their study design, how-
ever, it is difficult to elucidate whether a beneficial effect was
due to calcium, to vitamin D, or to the combination. In our

study, subjects not on calcium supplements had vitamin D
insufficiency (32, 40) as evidenced by the negative relation-
ship between serum 25OH vitamin D and serum PTH and
urine NTX/Cr. However, in the presence of calcium insuf-
ficiency, the concentration of serum 25OH vitamin D that
separates vitamin D insufficiency from sufficiency is prob-
lematic as shown in Fig. 5. These subjects showed a positive
effect of vitamin D status (serum 25OH Vitamin D concen-
tration) on bone mass, indicating that vitamin D insufficiency
produces a state of calcium insufficiency. In contrast, a high
vitamin D status in calcium-supplemented subjects provided
no additional benefit. Indeed, the effect of calcium on bone
loss was blunted in subjects with the highest levels of serum
25OH vitamin D. Whether this represents an effect of high
serum 25OH vitamin D to increase bone resorption (41) is not
clear, but it perhaps points to the danger of over-supple-
mentation of the elderly with vitamin D if they are on an
adequate calcium intake.
There are several weaknesses in this study. Firstly, the
sample of men and women recruited may not reflect the
general elderly population. However, their rates of bone loss
and biochemical abnormalities are similar to those found in
studies of large populations. Secondly, the study contained
no minorities and the results can only be applied to white
men and women over the age of 60. Thirdly, the dropout rate
was about 11% per year. This largely reflected the fact that
inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to include subjects
at risk of calcium and vitamin D insufficiency and not just the
healthy; that the study was designed to last 4 yr; and that the
age range of the subjects was not restricted, ranging from
60–97. On the other hand, the subjects were free living and
not a particularly disadvantaged group such as would be
found with non-free living nursing home residents. Never-
theless, whether the data were analyzed using an intent-to-
treat analysis or a repeated measure analysis, the results were
the same.
Supplementation was safe with no troublesome hypercal-
ciuria or hypercalcemia. The main adverse event was in the
calcium supplemented subjects who had more gastrointes-
tinal symptoms than the vitamin D or placebo group. There
was no significant effect on fracture as expected from our
sample size. However, the calcium-supplemented group had
the lowest fracture rate and the vitamin D supplement the
highest.
In conclusion, the elderly continuously lose bone mass at
the hip, and a substantial proportion of them are calcium and
vitamin D insufficient. A calcium supplement that increases
the calcium intake close to the Adequate Intake of 1200 mg/
day prevents bone loss at the hip and at other skeletal sites
and has beneficial effects on bone structure at the upper
femur. The supplement is safe, well tolerated and, is appli-
cable to the general population. The mechanism of action is
probably through the reversal of a state of calcium insuffi-
ciency, resulting in an increased supply of calcium to the
skeleton and a reduction in secondary hyperparathyroidism
and high bone turnover. The effect of a vitamin D supple-
ment is less marked and is most beneficial in subjects who are
vitamin D and calcium insufficient. A concerted effort is
required to educate the elderly to take 1.2 g/day of calcium
in the diet, to maintain their serum 25OH vitamin D above
the vitamin D insufficiency level of 75 nmol/L with the
expectation that this will reduce the incidence of fractures,
particularly hip fracture.
