ABSTRACT: Dietary supplementation with vitamin K1, with vitamin D3 and calcium or their combination, 
was examined in healthy older women during a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Combined 
vitamin K with vitamin D plus calcium was associated with a modest but significant increase in BMC at the 
ultradistal radius but not at other sites in the hip or radius. 
Introduction: The putative beneficial role of high dietary vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) on BMD and the 
possibility of interactive benefits with vitamin D were studied in a 2-year double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 
in healthy Scottish women (cid:1)60 years of age. 
Materials and Methods: Healthy, nonosteoporotic women (n (cid:1) 244) were randomized to receive either (1) 
placebo, (2) 200 (cid:2)g/day vitamin K1, (3) 10 (cid:2)g (400 IU) vitamin D3 plus 1000 mg calcium/day, or (4) combined 
vitamins K1 and D3 plus calcium. Baseline and 6-month measurements included DXA bone mineral scans of 
the hip and wrist, markers of bone turnover, and vitamin status. Supplementation effects were tested using 
multivariate general linear modeling, with full adjustment for baseline and potential confounding variables. 
Results: Significant bone mineral loss was seen only at the mid-distal radius but with no significant difference 
between groups. However, women who took combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus calcium showed a 
significant and sustained increase in both BMD and BMC at the site of the ultradistal radius. Serum status 
indicators responded significantly to respective supplementation with vitamins K and D. Over 2 years, serum 
vitamin K1 increased by 157% (p < 0.001), the percentage of undercarboxylated osteocalcin (%GluOC) 
decreased by 51% (p < 0.001), serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] increased by 17% (p < 0.001), and PTH 
decreased by 11% (p (cid:1) 0.049). 
Conclusions: These results provide evidence of a modest synergy in healthy older women from nutritionally 
relevant intakes of vitamin K1 together with supplements of calcium plus moderate vitamin D3 to enhance 
BMC at the ultradistal radius, a site consisting of principally trabecular bone. The substantial increase in 
(cid:3)-carboxylation of osteocalcin by vitamin K may have long-term benefits and is potentially achievable by 
increased dietary intakes of vitamin K rather than by supplementation.

the rate of bone mineral loss and therefore extend years 
of active, good-quality life offer a potential means of im- 
proving bone health. Dietary change is one potentially 
achievable and sustainable approach. Undernutrition is of- 
ten observed in older people and is likely to be a significant 

contributing risk factor to the pathogenesis and outcome of 
hip fracture in the elderly.(1,2) Dietary intervention strate- 
gies have focused mainly on calcium and vitamin D; supple- 
mentation with either or both of these nutrients having 
been shown in some studies to be effective in maintaining 
BMD or in reducing the incidence of fractures.(3–6) Not all 
studies have shown these benefits,(7) including three recent 
fracture prevention trials carried out in the United King- 
dom(8,9) and the United States.(10) Another nutrient that is 
being increasingly linked to bone health and osteoporosis is 
vitamin K.(2,11–13)

treatment arms and subject numbers re- 
cruited and retained. 
Vitamin K is needed as a co-factor to convert certain 
peptide-bound glutamate (Glu) residues to (cid:3)-carboxygluta- 
mate (Gla) residues in target proteins (Gla proteins) that 
are synthesized by a variety of tissues. Bone matrix contains 
several Gla proteins, of which osteocalcin is the most abun- 
dant.(11,12) The synthesis of Gla residues imbues vitamin 
K–dependent proteins with structural integrity, metal bind- 
ing characteristics, and functionality; in the case of osteo- 
calcin, the Gla residues confer high affinity binding to bone 
hydroxyapatite.(14) Although its precise function is unclear, 
osteocalcin seems to act as a regulator of bone remodeling 
and/or bone mineral maturation.(15) A clear rationale for 
ensuring optimal dietary intakes of vitamin K is the evi- 
dence that a high circulating level of undercarboxylated 
osteocalcin (GluOC) is an independent risk predictor of 
bone fractures(16–19) and of low BMD.(20,21) In addition, 
short-term studies show that the (cid:3)-carboxylation status of 
osteocalcin responds to increased vitamin K intakes in the 
usual dietary range.(22,23) The possibility that vitamin D 
itself may also influence the (cid:3)-carboxylation status of os- 
teocalcin has been raised by evidence that the free Gla 
content of animal bones(24) and circulating GluOC in el- 
derly women(16) both reflect vitamin D status. This unsub- 
stantiated effect of vitamin D on posttranslational (cid:3)-car- 
boxylation is independent of the well-established role of 
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D as a potent enhancer of osteocal- 
cin expression.(25) 
To date, the only published trials that have assessed the 
effects of vitamin K on postmenopausal bone loss have 
used supradietary daily doses of either 1 mg of vitamin 
(26) or 45 mg of vitamin K2 (menaquinone-4; menatetra- 
K1 
none).(27–29) Our placebo-controlled study was designed to 
establish the influence of an additional daily intake of 200 
(cid:2)g vitamin K1 on the bone health of older women. This 
extra vitamin K1 intake was equivalent to the 95th percen- 
tile of younger adult intake in Scotland(30) and equivalent 
to that contained in a 40- to 60-g portion of leafy green 
vegetables such as collards and spinach.(31) This intake 
could reasonably be considered to be attainable by dietary 
modification rather than from supplementation. Supple- 
mentation at a high dietary level is justified by evidence 
from population studies in the United States that low con- 
sumption of vitamin K in some groups is associated with 
elevated fracture risk(32,33) or lower bone mass(34) and that 
an impaired vitamin K status is associated with low bone 
mass(35) or increased bone turnover.(36) Our trial was also 
designed to study the effects, and possible interaction with 
vitamin K, of vitamin D and calcium at additional daily 
intakes of 10 (cid:2)g (400 IU) and 1000 mg, respectively. The 
vitamin D intake was as recommended for elderly people in 
the United Kingdom at the time this study was initiated.(37) 


Healthy women (cid:1)60 years of age were recruited from the 
general population to provide approximately equal num- 
bers in the age groups 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, and (cid:1)75 years. 
Exclusion criteria were clinical osteoporosis or chronic dis- 
ease (e.g., diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancer, 
fat malabsorption syndromes), routine medication that in- 
terferes with vitamin K, vitamin D, or bone metabolism 
(notably warfarin and steroids), and consumption of nutri- 
ent supplements that provided in excess of 30 (cid:2)g vitamin K, 
10 (cid:2)g (400 IU) vitamin D, or 500 mg calcium daily. Hoff- 
mann-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland) provided the supple- 
mentation tablets. One set of these tablets was in a chew- 
able form and contained either 1000 mg of elemental 
calcium as calcium carbonate plus 10 (cid:2)g of vitamin D3 or 
placebo ingredients in a matching form. A second set of 
smaller, oval-shaped tablets contained 200 (cid:2)g of vitamin K1 
(or placebo); these were swallowed whole with a drink. The 
244 participants were randomly assigned to one of the four 
study groups: (1) placebo, (2) vitamin K1 200 (cid:2)g/day, (3) 
calcium 1000 mg plus vitamin D3 10 (cid:2)g (400 IU)/day, or (4) 
combined supplementation with vitamin K1 and vitamin D3 
plus calcium at the levels in groups 2 and 3 (Fig. 1). To 
ensure double-blinding, an independent statistician at Hoff- 
mann-La Roche, who had no other connection to the study, 


provided a computer-generated randomization list to the 
researchers. Each participant was asked to take two tablets 
every day with their breakfast. The Tayside Committee on 
Medical Research Ethics approved the study, and all par- 
ticipants gave written informed consent. 
Baseline measurements were performed in the winter, 
and subsequent measurements were performed every 6 
months for 2 years. On each occasion, participants visited 
between 8:30 and 9:30 a.m. after an overnight fast, and a 
venous blood sample was taken, spun, aliquoted, and frozen 
for storage at –70°C within 1 h ofcollection. Weight and 
height were measured. Smoking habits, sunshine exposure, 
adherence to protocol by pill counting, and medication 
changes were noted. Dietary intake was assessed using a 
validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) designed for 
studies of osteoporosis in Scottish women,(38) and nutrient 
intakes from supplements were added to those derived 
from diet alone to produce a total energy and nutrient in- 
take profile for participants. Subjects provided a urine 
sample between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m. after an early morning 
void. 

DXA of the femur was carried out every 6 months using 
the same Lunar (DPX(cid:4)) machine with software version 
1.11 and 1.15 (Lunar Corp., Madison, WI, USA). Changes 
in software did not affect earlier analyses. The recom- 
mended Lunar scanning procedure guidelines were fol- 
lowed. Medium scan mode was used for all subjects, and the 
current was either 750 or 3000 (cid:2)A, depending on the body 
mass index (BMI) of the subject. Previous scans were al- 
ways examined before and during follow-up scans. The Os- 
teoscan pDXA was used for the scanning of the radius, with 
software version 2.1x (NIM, Verona, Italy). In the standard 
analysis, the Osteoscan automatically marks the bone edges 
and positions two region of interest (ROI) boxes, of fixed 
size: one at the ultradistal site (just distal to the ulnar sty- 
loid) and one at the mid-distal site (starting at one third of 
the distance between the ulna styloid and the olecranon). 
The nondominant wrist was measured unless there had 
been a fracture, and on repeat scans, the analysis ROI 
boxes were matched to the baseline scan. Bone scan results 
were expressed as BMC (mg) and BMD (BMC divided by 
bone area; mg/cm2). The CVs for BMD and BMC measure- 
ments, respectively, were as follows: femoral neck, 1.7% 
and 2.1%; Ward’s, 5.1% and 8.7%; trochanter, 2.2% and 
7.1%; ultradistal radius, 1.8% and 2.6%; mid-distal radius, 
1.9% and 2.1%. 

Serum vitamin K1 was measured by HPLC as previously 
described.(39) Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] was 
measured by radioimmunoassay using a 125I radioimmuno- 
assay (RIA) kit (68100E; DiaSorin, Wokingham, UK). 
PTH was measured with the Immulite intact PTH assay 
(EURO/DPC, Llanberis, Wales, UK). Serum bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase (BALP) analyses were carried out us- 
ing the Alkphase-B immunoassay kit (Metra Biosystems, 
Great Haseley, UK). Undercarboxylated and carboxylated 
serum osteocalcin (GluOC and GlaOC) were determined 
by separate immunoassays using the respective ELISA kits 
from Takara Shuzo (Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The sum of 
GluOC and GlaOC was used as a measure of total OC. As 
previously recommended,(40) the vitamin K status of bone 
was also evaluated by expressing the GluOC fraction as a 
percentage of total OC. Midmorning urine samples were 
analyzed for creatinine with a COBAS Bio multichannel 
analyser using the Boehringer alkaline picrate colorimetric 
method (124192; Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Ger- 
many). Urinary cross-linked N-teleopeptides of type I col- 
lagen (NTX) was measured using the NTX ELISA kit Os- 
teomark (Ostex, Seattle, WA, USA). 
The above biochemical indices were monitored at base- 
line and 6-month intervals (BALP, GluOC, GlaOC, NTX) 
or at baseline and yearly intervals [25(OH)D, vitamin K1, 
PTH]. Measurements of each analyte were carried out on 
samples batched by visit except for BALP and PTH, which 
were performed after the study completion, with samples 
for each subject batched and analyzed in the same assay 
run. Assay performance was monitored against external 
QA schemes for 25(OH)D, vitamin K1, and PTH or, when 
no scheme was available, against in-house quality assurance 
(QA) schemes. 

Statistical procedures were carried out in SPSS (version 
10) and SAS. Descriptive statistics were performed for all 
variables at baseline and on each 6-month visit. Data were 
transformed toward normality and parametric tests used, 
with statistical significance taken as p < 0.05. Correlation 
and linear regression procedures were used to study rela- 
tionships between variables. ANOVA and (cid:5)2 tests were 
used to detect differences between groups and distribu- 
tions. 
Separate analyses of the bone mineral variables (BMC 
and BMD) were carried out to address the possibility that 
BMD does not sufficiently correct for influences of body 
size, because its derivation as BMC/bone area indicates an 
areal rather than a volumetric density. Use of BMC with 
separate adjustment for bone area has been advocated by 
Prentice et al.(41) to be more statistically rigorous (because 
it allows the relationship between these two measures to be 
unforced) and to provide a better adjustment for body size. 
In line with this approach, we used BMC as the dependent 
variable and included bone area, weight, and height as in- 
dependent variables in all multiple regression models.(41) 
To study the influence of baseline values on response to 
supplementation, changes in bone mineral and biochemical 
markers [e.g., 25(OH)D, GluOC, GlaOC] were expressed 
as a percentage of baseline values and compared across 
fourths of the baseline distribution using ANOVA. 
Cross-sectional multiple regression analysis was used to 
reveal factors contributing to variance in BMD and BMC at 
baseline and other time-points. Repeated-measures 
ANOVA and general linear model (GLM) procedures 
(SPSS) were used initially to study the significance of 
changes in BMC and BMD within and between the inter- 
vention groups, with appropriate adjustment for covariates 
(including baseline age, bone area, weight, height, physical

activity, total energy intake, calcium and other nutrient in- 
takes, serum markers of vitamin D and vitamin K status, 
and markers of bone turnover). Separate GLMs, with pair- 
wise comparisons against baseline values, were carried out 
by a statistician, unrelated to the study, who was blind to 
the groups (Dr Mishra), using the SAS package. 

daily intakes were within the inclusion criteria of <10 (cid:2)g 
vitamin D, <500 mg calcium, and <30 (cid:2)g vitamin K1. Fifty- 
one percent of the study population reported consuming at 
least one supplement on at least one of the five 6-month 
visits. Food supplement use did not differ by group and had 
a substantial effect on the recorded intakes of vitamin C 
(∼20%) and of vitamin D (∼40%) but not on vitamin K1 or 
calcium. 


A flow chart with the numbers of subjects randomly as- 
signed and retained in each treatment arm at successive 
6-month visits is shown in Fig. 1. Of the 244 eligible women 
randomized into the study, 209 (85.6%) completed the 
2-year study, with good supplement adherence based on pill 
count (median, 99; interquartile range [IQR], 97.3–99.8%). 
Reasons for withdrawal were illness unrelated to the study 
(n (cid:1) 17); volunteer preference, noncompliance, or other 
violations of the inclusion criteria (n (cid:1) 14); and low BMD 
necessitating further medical intervention (n (cid:1) 4). Of six 
subjects who specifically reported dislike of the tablets as a 
reason for dropping out, the distribution between groups 
was vitamin K (n (cid:1) 2), vitamin D plus calcium (n (cid:1) 2), and 
combined vitamins K and D plus calcium (n (cid:1) 2). 
There were no between-group differences in age, age at 
menopause, history of oophorectomy, smoking habit, past 
use of oral contraceptives, or hormone replacement 
therapy. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of the 
participants and their basal dietary intakes of relevant nu- 
trients. Energy and macronutrient intakes at baseline did 
not differ significantly between groups. The mean calcium 
and phylloquinone intakes were adequate, according to UK 
guidelines,(37) but vitamin D intakes in all but three subjects 
were below the 10 (cid:2)g/day recommended in this age group. 
There were no significant group differences for intakes of 
the trace elements copper, magnesium, manganese, potas- 
sium, selenium, and zinc (data not shown). Regular supple- 
ment taking was permitted as part of usual dietary intake if 
The unadjusted mean changes (95% CI) in BMD and 
BMC over the 2-year study are shown in Table 2. There 
were no significant differences between intervention groups 
at any bone site. However, significant changes from base- 
line were found at some sites. At the mid-distal radius, 
BMD fell significantly from baseline in all groups (p < 
0.001), indicating bone loss of between 1% and 2% per 
year, irrespective of intervention. At the ultradistal radius, 
whereas there were no significant differences from baseline 
in the placebo, vitamin K, or vitamin D plus calcium groups, 
there was a significant increase in BMD of 0.8% per year 
(p < 0.01) in the combined vitamin K and vitamin D plus 
calcium group. Unadjusted BMC at the ultradistal radius 
showed the same significant gain in bone mineral (p < 0.01) 
in women who had received combined supplementation 
with vitamin K and D. Although there was a slight 2-year 
rise in both BMD and BMC at the ultradistal radius in the 
placebo group, this did not achieve significance. At the 
femoral trochanter, there were no significant differences 
from baseline in BMD, but there were significant 2-year 
rises in BMC in the placebo group, vitamin D group, and 
combined vitamin groups (Table 2). 
The DXA data were also analyzed by GLM procedures, 
with appropriate adjustment of covariates as described in 
the Materials and Methods section. An essentially similar 
picture was obtained for both BMD and BMC results at all 
bone sites except for the femoral trochanter, where there 
were unexplained significant gains in BMC but not BMD at 
some visits in all groups. There were no significant differ- 
ences for adjusted BMD or BMC between the four treat- 
ment groups, but changes from baseline were observed. For 
the most part, only adjusted BMC results are presented 
here, in line with previous recommendations for the report- 
ing of bone mineral measurements in population-based re- 
search.(41) The 6-month changes from baseline in covariate- 
adjusted BMC at the three sites of the femur and for the 
mid-distal radius are shown in Fig. 2. As found for the 
unadjusted results, there were significant increases from 
baseline in adjusted BMC at the femoral trochanter after 1 
year and beyond in both the vitamin D group and in the 
combined vitamins K and D group. On the other hand, 
there was a significant increase in trochanter BMC in the 
placebo group after 2 years. Adjusted values for BMC at 
the mid-distal radius confirmed that there was a progressive 
loss of bone mineral at this site over 24 months. 
The only consistent intervention effect on BMD and 
BMC was seen at the ultradistal radius. GLM-adjusted 
changes (95% CI) in BMD and BMC are shown in Fig. 3. 
This rigorous analysis confirmed the findings from the un- 
adjusted data that bone mineral had increased from base- 
line at the ultradistal radius in the combined intervention 
group, with significant increases in BMD at 18 and 24 
months and in BMC at all visits from 6 months onward. A 
significant increase in BMD in the placebo group was only 
evident at the 6-month time-point. 
Changes in indicators of vitamin K and vitamin 
D status 
The effect of intervention on tissue and functional mark- 
ers of vitamin K and vitamin D status during the study are 
shown in Table 3. With the exception of %GluOC and 
25(OH)D, the status indicators showed a skewed distribu- 
tion; for these indicators, geometric means are given in 
Table 3 because they represent better average measures for 
such non-normally distributed data. Fasting vitamin K1 se- 
rum concentrations rose significantly in response to vitamin 
K such that the geometric mean for all supplemented sub- 
jects had risen by 157% (95% CI, 101, 212) after 2 years. 
Vitamin K supplementation induced a significant 40% de- 
crease in the absolute concentration of GluOC and a sig- 
nificant 105% increase in GlaOC over 2 years (Table 3). 
The apparent lower influence of vitamin K on the GluOC 
fraction compared with GlaOC is explained by the finding 
that both fractions rose with time independently of vitamin 
K. This non–vitamin K–dependent rise was slightly greater 
for GluOC than for GlaOC. Over 2 years, the geometric 
means for GluOC increased in the nonsupplemented 
groups by 49% (placebo) and 69% (vitamin D plus cal- 
cium), respectively, whereas for GlaOC, the equivalent in- 
creases were 30% and 24%, respectively. The bone vitamin 
K status indicator, %GluOC,(40) responded substantially to 
vitamin K supplementation, with 2-year decreases of 48% 
(vitamin K) and 54% (vitamins K and D) and an overall 
decrease of 51% (95% CI, −47.5, −54.0). These changes in 
the (cid:3)-carboxylation status of osteocalcin were evident, and 
consistent, from 6 months onward. In contrast, there was a 
trend for %GluOC to rise over 2 years in the non–vitamin

neck, femoral Ward’s, femoral trochanter, 
and mid-distal radius after successive 
6-month intervals of supplementation. *Sig- 
nificant change from baseline. 
Serum 25(OH)D rose significantly (p < 0.001) in re- 
sponse to vitamin D supplementation, with a mean increase 
of 16.7% (95% CI, 9.0, 24.4) over 2 years. This rise in 
25(OH)D was accompanied by a significant fall (p (cid:1) 0.002) 
in PTH of 10.9% (95% CI, −20.6, −1.2). In contrast, 
25(OH)D fell significantly (p < 0.001) in the non–vitamin 
D–supplemented subjects, with a mean decrease of 17.5% 
(95% CI, −13.5, −21.4) over 2 years, but PTH showed no 
significant change. Quartile analysis showed that the 
women showing higher percentage increases in 25(OH)D 
had lower concentrations at baseline (results not shown) 
For every status marker measured, there was no evidence 
of an additive effect in women who took combined vitamin 
K and vitamin D plus calcium. 

Baseline 25(OH)D was negatively correlated to PTH be- 
fore (r (cid:1) –0.23, p < 0.01) and after age adjustment (r (cid:1) 
–0.26, p < 0.001), and this relationship was unaffected by 
vitamin D supplementation. Further analyses using a re- 
peated-measure, multivariate linear regression model were 
carried out to study the ability of serum 25(OH)D to pre- 
dict change in serum PTH concentrations over time. To 
avoid seasonal influence, the chosen time intervals were 
baseline, 12 months, and 24 months, representing subject 
visits during October to January. This data has been previ- 
ously reported in abstract form.(42) In brief, change in se- 
rum 25(OH)D was found to be a strong independent nega- 
tive predictor of the change in PTH, with regression 
coefficient × 100 (±SE) (cid:1) –0.9 (0.2), p < 0.0001. Previous 
PTH also positively predicted the change in PTH, with co- 
efficient × 100 (±SE) in the regression model (cid:1) 94 (3.7), 
p < 0.0001. When “current” 25(OH)D was substituted for 
“change” in 25(OH)D in the model, it was not a significant 
independent predictor of change in PTH. Neither age nor 
calcium intake was a significant predictor of change in PTH. 

No significant differences were found between groups for 
the markers of bone formation and resorption represented

K–supplemented groups, but the increases of 7.1% (pla- 
cebo) and 15.5% (vitamin D plus calcium) only reached 
significance in the latter. Quartile analysis showed that the 
greatest decreases in GluOC and %GluOC in the vitamin 
K supplementation groups occurred in those women with 
the highest values at baseline (results not shown).

This was a novel study, designed to address the specific 
question of whether taking regular, high-dietary amounts of 
vitamin K1, either alone, or in combination with moderate 
supplements of vitamin D3, could reduce the rate of bone 
mineral loss in healthy, nonosteoporotic older women. Cal- 
cium was included in the vitamin D treatment group to 
ensure adequacy but was not the nutrient of primary inter- 
est. The only comparable vitamin K1 supplementation trial 
published thus far is the Maastricht study, which differed in 
design and had a 5-fold higher vitamin K1 dose.(26) 
The power of our study to detect changes in bone mineral 
accretion was diminished both by the wide interindividual 
variation in BMD at baseline and by the lower than ex- 
pected rate of bone loss in the placebo group. However, it 
is recognized that the rate of bone loss in women of this age 
varies greatly, depending on the bone site, nutritional sta- 
tus, and other factors.(43,44) For example, in the recent 
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) trial in women 50–79 
years of age,(10) the placebo group showed a steady 9-year 
increase in BMD for the whole body and total spine, 
whereas BMD for the total hip declined by only 1% over 
the same period. Lesser(45) suggested that this may have 
been attributable to the “therapeutic” background intakes 
of calcium (1154 mg/day) and vitamin D (9.2 (cid:2)g/day) in that 
trial. In our study, the mean calcium intake at baseline of 
1055 mg/day was similar to that in the WHI trial but con- 
siderably higher than the 690 mg/day found in the British 
National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) of 1994/5 in 
women 65–84 years of age.(46) The mean background vita- 
min D intake in our study of 5.4 (cid:2)g/day was less than that 
of the WIH trial but greater than the nationally represen- 
tative intake of 3.5 (cid:2)g/day in British women 65–84 years of 
age.(46) In our study, the only bone site showing a consis- 
tently significant bone loss was the mid-distal radius, but the 
loss was not significantly different between placebo and 
supplementation groups. On the other hand, at the site of 
the ultradistal radius, we did observe a significant increase 
in BMC and BMD from baseline in those women who had 
received combined calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K. This 
increase was evident for unadjusted BMD and BMC and 
after adjustment for covariates. With its high content of 


trabecular bone, the ultradistal forearm has a higher meta- 
bolic turnover rate than predominantly cortical bone and 
may be more responsive to intervention effects. A study of 
healthy, postmenopausal women in Massachusetts sug- 
gested that vitamin D supplementation at 10 (cid:2)g/day was 
more effective in preventing bone loss of trabecular bone 
than of cortical bone.(47) The ultradistal forearm (but not 
the mid-distal forearm or lumbar spine) was previously 
shown by some of us to be similarly responsive to a 2-year 
combined exercise plus calcium intervention in older 
women.(48) The possible greater sensitivity of the ultradistal 
radius to a vitamin K effect is supported by the findings 
from a meta-analysis of nine studies in which BMD changes 
had been measured after exposure to oral anticoagu- 
lants.(49) Although this meta-analysis showed a trend to 
bone loss at most sites, a significant decrease in BMD was 
only observed at the ultradistal radius.(49) Thus, the effect 
of vitamin K antagonists seems to mirror our findings of 
vitamin K (with vitamin D) supplementation but in reverse. 
We did not measure vertebral BMD because of the con- 
founding effect of vascular calcification in older people and 
because matrix Gla protein is a vitamin K–dependent in- 
hibitor of vascular calcification.(13) This decision seems jus- 
tified in view of our previous exercise study(48) and the 
results of a 3-year intervention study from Maastricht in 
which a supplementation effect of combined vitamin K, vi- 
tamin D (with calcium), and additional minerals was found 
at the femoral neck but not at the lumbar spine.(26) In the 
Maastricht study, the rate of bone loss at the femoral neck 
was significantly slowed over 3 years in this combined vita- 
min K group but not in subjects receiving vitamin D plus 
minerals alone.(26) However, at 1 mg/day, the supplemen- 
tary vitamin K1 dose in the Maastricht study was 5-fold 
higher than in our study and would be difficult to achieve 
from dietary sources alone. 
The lack of a significant effect on BMD in the vitamin D 
plus calcium-supplemented group suggests that the im- 
provement in vitamin D status alone provided no additional 
benefit in these healthy older women who, on the basis of 
calcium intake, were already calcium replete. The efficacy 
of vitamin D given alone or with calcium in the prevention 
of bone loss or fractures is controversial, with some trials 
showing significant benefit(3,5,6) and some not.(7–10) A va- 
riety of factors could account for these differences, but im- 
portant variables include vitamin D status at baseline(50) 
and habitual calcium intake of the population under study. 
Our participants were younger, less frail, and were less 
likely to have vitamin D insufficiency and secondary hyper- 
parathyroidism than participants in some trials where a vi- 
tamin D/calcium intervention effect was seen; this may have 
limited any effect on bone mass. Evidence of a supposedly 
satisfactory vitamin D status in most of our subjects was 
supported by their mean baseline 25(OH)D concentration 
of 24 (cid:2)g/liter (60 nM) and by the fact that none fell below 
the level considered adequate (10 (cid:2)g/liter; 25 nM) by a UK 
working group.(46) Despite this, supplementation with 10 
(cid:2)g/day vitamin D3 not only significantly raised 25(OH)D 
levels but also significantly lowered PTH levels. The sup- 
pression of PTH, in particular, suggests that suboptimal vi- 
tamin D status was common in our participants. As in a 
large, global study,(50) we found that the increase in 
25(OH)D after vitamin D supplementation is strongly de- 
pendent on the baseline value, with maximal increases be- 
ing seen in those women with an initially low serum 
25(OH)D. Our analyses also revealed that the change in 
25(OH)D is predictive of the inverse change in PTH. These 
data support the concept that pre-existing vitamin D status 
is a major factor in determining the change in 25(OH)D in 
response to vitamin D supplementation and therefore of 
the degree of lowering in PTH levels.(50) Although meth- 
odological differences usually preclude comparisons of ab- 
solute values, the overall 2-year changes of 17% for 
25(OH)D and 11% for PTH were slightly lower than in 
other studies for an equivalent vitamin D dose.(6,50,51) This 
is again likely to reflect the better initial vitamin D status of 
our subjects. This is supported by comparing our results 
with a recent intervention study in free-living elderly in 
Randers, Denmark.(6) Comparison with this Danish study 
is especially valid because the doses of vitamin D (and cal- 
cium), the 2-year sampling period, and the methodology for 
25(OH)D and PTH measurements were exactly the same in 
both studies. In a small subset of the Danish participants, 
the equivalent 2-year changes for 25(OH)D and PTH were 
27% and 15%, respectively. These greater changes prob- 
ably reflected the lower baseline 25(OH)D of 15 (cid:2)g/liter in 
the Danish subjects compared with 24 (cid:2)g/liter in our Scot- 
tish subjects. Coincidentally, Randers and Dundee share 
exactly the same latitude (56°28(cid:2)). 
The basal intakes of vitamin K1 (mean, 85 (cid:2)g/day) are 
representative of intakes found in a UK National Survey of 
people (cid:1)65 years of age,(52) except that a lower proportion 
of our study population (27% versus 59%) failed to meet 
the current UK guideline of 1 (cid:2)g/kg body weight/day.(37) 
However, nearly two thirds of the women in our study 
failed to meet the more recent U.S. adequate intake of 
90 (cid:2)g/day.(53) 
Our study supports the concept(12,22,54,55) that much 
higher dietary intakes of vitamin K are needed for (cid:3)-car- 
boxylation of bone OC compared with the hepatic coagu- 
lation proteins. This is the first study to show that regular, 
long-term supplementation with vitamin K1 at a high di- 
etary level can substantially improve and maintain vitamin 
K status as evidenced by increases in both tissue stores 
(serum vitamin K1) and a functional marker (OC carbox- 
ylation). Although absolute values for %GluOC are assay 
dependent,(40) the reduction of ∼50% is consistent with that 
seen in short-term repletion studies after supplementation 
with ∼300 (cid:2)g of vitamin K1 
(22,23,55) but smaller than that 
after a supradietary dose of 1000 (cid:2)g/day.(55) In our study, 
maximal OC carboxylation was attained by 6 months and 
did not change significantly thereafter. It is noteworthy that 
those women with the most impaired vitamin K status at 
baseline (as represented by the highest quartiles of GluOC 
and %GluOC and lowest quartile of GlaOC, respectively) 
showed the greatest changes in OC carboxylation after vi- 
tamin K supplementation. 
We chose vitamin K1 for this study because this molecu- 
lar form accounts for 90% of dietary vitamin K intakes.(56) 
A proprietary preparation of menaquinone-4 (menatetra- 
none) is used as an anti-osteoporotic agent in Japan, and a 


recent meta-analysis of Japanese trials showed an associa- 
tion of menatetranone supplementation with reduced frac- 
ture incidence.(57) These menatetranone trials differed 
from our study in that the administered doses were ex- 
tremely large (generally 45 mg/day) and the target groups 
already had pre-existing involutional(27–29) or second- 
ary(58,59) osteoporosis or osteopenia. Enhanced effects on 
BMD have been found when menatetranone is used in 
combination with 1(cid:4)-hydroxycholecalciferol.(28,29) There is 
also evidence that the effectiveness of menatetranone in 
inhibiting bone loss is related to the specific geranyl-geranyl 
side chain of this form.(60,61) The existence of an unusual 
metabolic pathway that converts a fraction of dietary vita- 
min K1 to menaquinone-4(62) does not exclude the possi- 
bility that any benefit of supplementary vitamin K1 might 
be attributable to the menaquinone-4 thus formed. 
Our study provided no evidence that vitamin K1 taken 
alone at high dietary intakes had any influence on main- 
taining bone mass despite the improvement in OC carbox- 
ylation. However, the Japanese experience suggests that 
the effectiveness of vitamin K2 in preventing fractures is 
greater than that predicted from its ability to maintain bone 
mass.(27) This is supported by the finding in older American 
women that serum GluOC is more strongly related to ul- 
trasonic transmitted velocity than to femoral neck den- 
sity(63); this relationship prompted the authors to suggest 
that vitamin K insufficiency might have a greater effect on 
bone quality than on BMD. Our findings showing no de- 
monstrable effect of supplementation on markers of bone 
formation (BALP) and resorption (NTX) are in agreement 
with the lack of consistent effect on equivalent bone mark- 
ers after long-term supplementation with 1 mg vitamin 
(26) or 45 mg menatetranone.(27) The opposite findings of 
K1 
a rise(27) or fall(26) in OC may be artefactual (e.g., a conse- 
quence of the varying affinities of different OC antibodies 
to changing carboxylation status); this variability in OC re- 
sponse after vitamin K supplementation has been noted 
previously.(54,64) In this study, OC, as represented by the 
sum of the GluOC and GlaOC fractions, showed no differ- 
ences between groups. Subsequent work using a standard 
RIA for the intact OC (and 1–43 fragment) also showed no 
differences in OC between groups (MJ Shearer and CM 
Gundberg, unpublished observations). 
Although several large population studies have revealed 
significant associations of dietary intakes of vitamin K with 
fracture rates and/or BMD,(32–34) the results are not always 
consistent or uniform across the sexes or age groups. The 
same is true of associations with indicators of vitamin K 
status.(35) Clearly it is difficult to distinguish vitamin K sta- 
tus from all the other factors influencing changes in BMD, 
and one consistent criticism of these associations has been 
the difficulty in excluding the confounding effect of overall 
poor nutrition.(11,33) Nevertheless, in the Framingham 
study,(33) it is noteworthy that the top quartile of vitamin K1 
intake (median, 250 (cid:2)g/day), which was associated with re- 
duced fracture risk, was comparable with the mean total 
dietary intake achieved in this study of 285 (cid:2)g/day. 
This study lends support to the concept that vitamin K 
may act in concert with vitamin D to reduce bone loss. 
Three other studies have shown an enhanced effect of com- 
bined vitamin K and vitamin D supplementation,(26,28,29) 
but ours is the first in which the extra vitamin K intake can 
be considered to be within the dietary range. The mecha- 
nism(s) whereby parallel improvements in the status of 
both vitamins D and K might have an enhanced effect over 
either vitamin alone is unclear. It is feasible that any syn- 
ergy between vitamins D and K derives from separate ef- 
fects exerted independently or alternatively from their con- 
certed action through common proteins or pathways. It is 
known that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D enhances the tran- 
scription of vitamin K–dependent bone proteins (e.g., os- 
teocalcin, matrix Gla protein, and Gas6). Other evidence 
has led to the suggestion that vitamin D might directly in- 
fluence the (cid:3)-carboxylation reaction of bone Gla pro- 
teins.(16,24) This hypothesis was not supported by our find- 
ings because we showed that (cid:3)-carboxylation of osteocalcin 
was neither enhanced by vitamin D (relative to the placebo 
group) nor by its combination with vitamin K (relative to 
the vitamin K group). 
In summary, dietary supplementation with a combination 
of nutritionally relevant amounts of vitamin K with vitamin 
D and calcium in healthy older women was associated with 
a modest but significant increase in BMC at one site, con- 
sisting predominantly of trabecular bone. Similar changes 
were not observed in the either the vitamin K group alone 
or in the calcium plus vitamin D group, suggesting a syner- 
gistic role of the combination as suggested by previous re- 
ports.
