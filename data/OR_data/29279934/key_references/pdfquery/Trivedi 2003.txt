supplementation on fractures and mortality in men and 
women living in the community: randomised double blind 
controlled trial 
Daksha P Trivedi, Richard Doll, Kay Tee Khaw 

Objective To determine the effect of four monthly 
vitamin D supplementation on the rate of fractures in 
men and women aged 65 years and over living in the 
community. 
Design Randomised double blind controlled trial of 
100 000 IU oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) 
supplementation or matching placebo every four 
months over five years. 
Setting and participants 2686 people (2037 men and 
649 women) aged 65›85 years living in the general 
community, recruited from the British doctors register 
and a general practice register in Suffolk. 
Main outcome measures Fracture incidence and total 
mortality by cause. 
Results After five years 268 men and women had 
incident fractures, of whom 147 had fractures in 
common osteoporotic sites (hip, wrist or forearm, or 
vertebrae). Relative risks in the vitamin D group 
compared with the placebo group were 0.78 (95% 
confidence interval 0.61 to 0.99, P=0.04) for any first 
fracture and 0.67 (0.48 to 0.93, P=0.02) for first hip, 
wrist or forearm, or vertebral fracture. 471 
participants died. The relative risk for total mortality 
in the vitamin D group compared with the placebo 
group was 0.88 (0.74 to 1.06, P=0.18). Findings were 
consistent in men and women and in doctors and the 
general practice population. 
Conclusion Four monthly supplementation with 
100 000 IU oral vitamin D may prevent fractures 
without adverse effects in men and women living in 
the general community. 

Osteoporotic fractures are projected to increase expo› 
nentially worldwide.1 Most fracture prevention trials 
have focused on clinically defined groups such as 
people with osteoporosis or previous fractures and 
have mainly been conducted in women.2–7 Safe, 
effective, feasible, and cost effective primary prevention 
measures are needed in older men and women, in 
whom most osteoporotic fractures occur. We report 
results from a randomised double blind trial of four 
monthly supplementation with oral vitamin D3 on frac› 
tures and mortality in 2686 men and women aged 
65›85 years living in the community. 


Study population 
This trial was a pilot to assess the feasibility of a 
community trial (not subsequently conducted owing to 
lack of 
in 20 000 men and women. We 
recruited men and women aged 65›85 from the British 
doctors study register at the Clinical Trials Studies 
Unit, Oxford,8 and the age›sex register of a general 
practice in Ipswich, Suffolk. Cambridge local ethics 
committee approved the study. 
Recruitment and randomisation 
We recruited participants by using a mailed letter and 
information sheet. We excluded people who were 
already taking vitamin D supplements and people with 
conditions that were contraindications to vitamin D 
supplementation—for example, a history of renal 
stones, sarcoidosis, or malignancy. 
We sent invitations to 11 120 people (9582 from 
the British doctors study and 1538 from general prac› 
tice), and 3504 (31.5%) of them (2907 from British 
doctors study and 597 from general practice) initially 
agreed to participate. From June 1996 to March 1997 
we randomised 2686 (77.5%) people who were eligible 
and gave informed consent, after stratification by age 
and sex, to receive either treatment with vitamin D or a 
placebo. Participants and investigators were blinded to 
the treatment until the study ended, when Ipswich 
Pharmacy revealed the coding. 
Study design 
We conducted the study by post. Participants 
completed an initial questionnaire. We assessed preva› 
lence of disease with the question “Do you have the 
following conditions?” followed by a checklist. We used 
a modified food frequency questionnaire at four years 
to estimate dietary calcium intake. 
Intervention 
We sent one capsule containing 100 000 IU vitamin D3 
(cholecalciferol) or matching placebo by post every

Statistical analyses 
We included all participants randomised to active vita› 
min D or placebo in the analyses, according to 
intention to treat. We compared relative risks for 
incidence of fracture, mortality by cause, and incidence 
of cardiovascular disease and cancer for active vitamin 
D versus placebo by using crude rates and then, after 
adjustment for age, with the Cox regression method,12 
by using SPSS software, version 10.0. 

Characteristics of participants 
Table 1 shows baseline descriptive data. Mean calcium 
intake at four years was 742 mg/day and did not differ 
by treatment allocation. 
Incidence of fracture 
Table 2 shows five year fracture rates. Participants in 
the vitamin D treatment group had a 22% lower rate 
for first fracture at any site and a 33% lower rate for a 
fracture occurring in the hip, wrist or forearm, or

participants to take the capsule immediately on

for endpoints. 
Endpoint ascertainment 
On receiving the capsule, participants filled in a check› 
list of events (fracture or major illness) and returned 
the form by Freepost. All participants were flagged at 
the Office for National Statistics for mortality and 
followed until 31 March 2002. A nosologist blind to the 
intervention coded death certificates by using ICD›9 
(international classification of diseases, 9th revision). 
We ascertained incidences of fracture, cardiovascular 
disease, and cancer by using events identified from 
questionnaires or death certification by cause. 
Serum 25›hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone, 
and heel sonometry 
After four years we invited 235 participants from gen› 
eral practice who had taken at least 10 capsules to a 
clinic for measurement of serum vitamin D and 
parathyroid hormone concentrations. The visit took 
place in September and October, about three weeks 
after a dose. We assessed heel bone sonometry with 
CUBA equipment (McCue Ultrasonics, Winchester).

(fig 1). 
Other health events 
Table 3 shows cumulative mortality to March 2002. 
The vitamin D group had slightly but not significantly 
lower mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, 
and cancer than the placebo group. Figure 2 shows the 
cumulative probability of survival in the vitamin D 
group compared with the placebo group over five 
years. Table 4 shows the incidence of major health 
events. These did not differ significantly between the 
treatment groups. 
Physiological variables and compliance 
Table 5 shows mean serum concentrations of vitamin 
D and parathyroid hormone and heel bone ultrasound 
attenuation in the subgroup. Mean vitamin D concen› 
trations were 40% higher in the active treatment group 
than in the placebo group. Mean parathyroid 
concentrations were 6% lower, but this difference was 
not significant. Heel ultrasound measures did not differ 
by treatment. 
Compliance did not differ between doctors and the 
general practice population or between the treatment 
groups; 76% (2050/2686) of participants had at least 
80% compliance (12/15 doses). Compliance for the 
final dose was 66% (1784/2686); excluding partici› 
pants who had died, we estimated compliance to be 
80% (1784/2215). A total of 631 (23.5%) participants, 
including those who died, did not complete the full five 
years to March 2002—22.8% (307) in the vitamin D 
group and 24.2% (324) in the placebo group (P=0.41). 
No significant difference existed between the two 
groups in the number known to be alive but who with› 
drew (that is, discontinued questionnaire follow up) 
from the study: 5.7% (77) in the placebo group and 
6.2% (83) in the active group (P=0.64). 

Among men and women aged 65›85 living in the 
general population, those allocated to supplementa› 
tion with vitamin D had lower rates of fracture at any 
site or at any major osteoporotic site (hip, wrist or fore› 
arm, or vertebrae). We ascertained the incidence of

hood of accurate ascertainment of events. Fracture 
rates did not differ significantly between doctors and 
the general practice population, indicating that people 
in the general community report fracture accurately, 
an assumption supported by several studies.13 14 
Comparisons with previous studies 
Several studies report that daily supplementation with 
vitamin D and calcium reduces fractures.2 3 Chapuy 
reported that daily supplementation with vitamin D 
800 IU and calcium reduced hip fractures by 30% over 
three years in 3270 elderly women.2 Whether calcium 
alone, vitamin D alone, or the combination was 
responsible for these effects is not clear. In our study 
the effect size of isolated vitamin D supplementation— 
about 20% reduction in total fractures and 30% reduc› 
tion in fractures at major osteoporotic sites—is 
comparable to that reported by Chapuy for combined 
daily vitamin D and calcium.2 
Previous studies of isolated vitamin D supplemen› 
tation have been inconclusive.15–17 The lack of 
significant reduction in fractures in these studies could 
be explained by a lack of power due to a lower dose of 
supplement, shorter duration, or lower number of 
events as well as ineffectiveness of vitamin D. Lips 
found no protective effect of vitamin D 400 IU daily in 
1578 participants.16 This dose may have been too low 
to achieve a clinical effect. In our study the four 
monthly 100 000 IU dose averages a daily equivalent 
similar to the 800 IU vitamin D used in the trials by 
Chapuy and Dawson Hughes.2 3 Heikinheimo, using 
injections of 150 000›300 000 IU in 899 
annual 
participants, reported a reduction in fractures of the 
upper limb but not the lower limb.17 This study was not 
properly randomised or blinded, and a single annual 
dose may not provide adequate concentrations in the 
blood over a whole year. 
Vitamin D may protect against fractures through 
concentrations of parathyroid hormone. Low concen› 
trations of vitamin D are associated with increased 
increased 
concentrations of parathyroid hormone, 
bone resorption, and lower bone mass.9–11 The 40% 
higher mean concentrations of vitamin D seen in the 
active treatment group in our trial were still not high 
in absolute terms. Parathyroid hormone concentra› 
tions were only slightly and not significantly lower. 
This suggests that 100 000 IU vitamin D four monthly 
may not have lowered parathyroid hormone concen› 
trations adequately, and a more frequent dose might 
be considered in future trials. 
We found no significant effects of vitamin D on 
total mortality or incidence of cancer or cardiovas› 
cular disease, as suggested by observational studies.18 19 
However, the fact that the relative risks were in a 
favourable direction in the active treatment group is 
reassuring.

Generalisability 
To maximise generalisability, this was a pragmatic trial 
with minimal exclusion criteria. The doctors were simi› 
lar to the general practice population in terms of com› 
pliance, fracture rates, and effects of vitamin D. Blood 
concentrations of vitamin D in participants taking pla› 
cebo were comparable to those of population groups 
of similar ages in northern latitudes in the United 
States3 and higher than those in older European popu› 
lations living in northern latitudes.16 20 If vitamin D 
supplementation is safe and effective for fracture 
prevention, even in relatively replete healthy partici› 
pants, it is unlikely to be of lesser benefit in people with 
lower vitamin D levels. 

Public health implications 
This trial was a pilot for a larger trial that was not 
funded and was, consequently, 
for any 
decisive effect on fractures to be expected. The results, 
nevertheless, indicate that isolated vitamin D supple› 
mentation prevents 
is particularly 
Several 
important 
interventions—such as bisphosphonates, oestrogen, 
and calcium and vitamin D—reduce fractures in high 
risk groups.2–7 Their application to primary prevention 
is, however, problematic as the balance of risk›benefit 
and cost›benefit differs in primary and secondary pre› 
vention. 




The alendronate trial identified 2000 women at 
high risk of fracture (low bone mineral density and 
previous fracture).4 The 25% reduction in fractures 
seen translates to an absolute benefit of 60 women 
treated for one year to prevent any fracture; the 
absolute benefit was lower in a later trial on women 
without a previous fracture.5 Whereas relative reduc› 
tions in fracture may be generalisable, the absolute 
benefit differs in groups in which absolute fracture 
risks are lower. The 22% reduction in fractures in our 
study translates to approximately 250 people treated 
for one year to prevent any fracture. 
Risk of fracture is related to bone health across the 
whole population distribution, such that most fractures 
do not occur in the small numbers of people with 
severe osteoporosis at very high risk but in the large 
numbers at moderately increased risk. To have a 
substantial effect on total fractures in the population, 
intervention would be needed in large numbers of 
people; 
consequently, population›wide preventive 
interventions have been proposed for all elderly 
people.21 
However, the dilemma for primary prevention is 
that whereas the population attributable risk is large, 
the absolute individual risk is still low.22 The risk›benefit 
balance for community based prevention differs from 
that 
for intervention in clinically defined groups. 
Safety, feasibility, and cost effectiveness are crucial. Side 
effects are less acceptable in a healthy group in which 
the risk of fracture is not high. This is a particular issue 
in men, in whom evidence on effective fracture preven› 
tion is lacking. Many interventions effective in high risk 
groups are not feasible in the general population 
owing to poor compliance or side effects or are not 
cost effective.23 In contrast, the cost of four monthly 
oral 100 000 IU vitamin D is minimal ( < £1 annually). 

Conclusion 
We found a single oral 100 000 IU dose of vitamin D 
four monthly to be acceptable, safe, and effective in 
reducing the incidence of fracture in men and women 
aged over 65 living in the general community.
