Oral vitamin D3 and calcium for secondary prevention of 
low-trauma fractures in elderly people (Randomised 
Evaluation of Calcium Or vitamin D, RECORD): a randomised 
placebo-controlled trial 

Summary 
Background Elderly people who have a fracture are at high risk of another. Vitamin D and calcium supplements are 
often recommended for fracture prevention. We aimed to assess whether vitamin D3 and calcium, either alone or 
in combination, were effective in prevention of secondary fractures. 
Methods In a factorial-design trial, 5292 people aged 70 years or older (4481 [85%] of whom were women) who were 
mobile before developing a low-trauma fracture were randomly assigned 800 IU daily oral vitamin D3, 1000 mg 
calcium, oral vitamin D3 (800 IU per day) combined with calcium (1000 mg per day), or placebo. Participants who 
were recruited in 21 UK hospitals were followed up for between 24 months and 62 months. Analysis was by 
intention-to-treat and the primary outcome was new low-energy fractures. 
Findings 698 (13%) of 5292 participants had a new low-trauma fracture, 183 (26%) of which were of the hip. The 
incidence of new, low-trauma fractures did not differ signiﬁcantly between participants allocated calcium and those 
who were not (331 [12·6%] of 2617 vs 367 [13·7%] of 2675; hazard ratio (HR) 0·94 [95% CI 0·81–1·09]); between 
participants allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (353 [13·3%] of 2649 vs 345 [13·1%] of 2643; 1·02 
[0·88–1·19]); or between those allocated combination treatment and those assigned placebo (165 [12·6%] of 1306 vs 
179 [13·4%] of 1332; HR for interaction term 1·01 [0·75–1·36]). The groups did not differ in the incidence of all- 
new fractures, fractures conﬁrmed by radiography, hip fractures, death, number of falls, or quality of life. By 
24 months, 2886 (54·5%) of 5292 were still taking tablets, 451 (8·5%) had died, 58 (1·1%) had withdrawn, and 1897 
(35·8%) had stopped taking tablets but were still providing data for at least the main outcomes. Compliance with 
tablets containing calcium was signiﬁcantly lower (difference: 9·4% [95% CI 6·6–12·2]), partly because of 
gastrointestinal symptoms. However, potentially serious adverse events were rare and did not differ between 
groups. 
Interpretation The ﬁndings do not support routine oral supplementation with calcium and vitamin D3, either alone 
or in combination, for the prevention of further fractures in previously mobile elderly people. 



Introduction 
Low-trauma fractures in elderly people are a substantial 
and increasing burden of ill health,1,2 and those who have 
a low-trauma fracture are at high risk of another.3 Low 
serum concentrations of vitamin D metabolites are 
widespread in elderly people in the UK,4 especially in 
low-trauma fractures.5 Vitamin D and 
those with 
calcium, 
are often 
recommended for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. 
Inadequate vitamin D status, exacerbated by low calcium 
intake, might raise the risk of these fractures by 
increasing bone resorption and loss from secondary 
hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D might also protect 
against falls that lead to fracture.6 Evidence from 
randomised trials favours the combination of calcium 
and vitamin D.7 In this secondary-prevention study we 
aimed to test whether calcium and vitamin D, alone or in 
combination compared with placebo, would lead to one 
less person per 100 having a fracture every year over a 
median of 3 years. 
Methods 
Participants 
15 024 people age 70 years or older who had had a low- 
trauma, osteoporotic fracture in the previous 10 years 
were assessed between Feb 1, 1999, and March 31, 2002. 
The trial was based in 21 hospitals in the UK. Ethics 
approval was obtained from the Multicentre Research 
Ethics Committee for Scotland and from the local 
research ethics committee of each hospital, and 
participants gave written informed consent. 
Study nurses identiﬁed potential participants from 
hospital notes of patients seen in a fracture clinic or 
orthopaedic ward; patients were also recruited by 
telephone. Reasons for exclusion were: bed or chair bound 
before fracture; cognitive impairment indicated by an 
abbreviated mental test score8 of less than seven; cancer in 
the past 10 years that was likely to metastasise to bone; 
fracture associated with pre-existing 
local bone 
abnormality; those known to have hypercalcaemia; renal 
stone in the past 10 years; life expectancy of less than 





6 months; individuals known to be leaving the UK; daily 
intake of more than 200 IU vitamin D or more than 
500 mg calcium supplements; intake in the past 5 years of 
ﬂuoride, bisphosphonates, calcitonin, tibolone, hormone- 
replacement 
oestrogen-receptor 
modulators, or any vitamin D metabolite (eg, calcitriol); 
and vitamin D by injection in the past year. An 
osteoporotic fracture was deﬁned as a fracture due to a fall 
from no more than standing height, or as a deﬁnite 
clinical event with radiologist-conﬁrmed evidence of a 
vertebral fracture. Fractures of the cervical spine, face, or 
skull, and those caused by road-trafﬁc accidents were not 
classed as osteoporotic. 
Study design 
Participants were randomly allocated to four equal groups 
and assigned two tablets with meals daily consisting of 
800 IU vitamin D3, 1000 mg calcium (given as carbonate), 
vitamin D3 (800 IU) combined with calcium (1000 mg), or 
placebo. Tablets varied in size and taste and thus each had 
matching placebos. All materials were delivered by post 
every 4 months9 and participants were asked to take tablets 
until trial closure. 
Randomisation was centralised; computer-generated; 
stratiﬁed by centre; and minimised by age (younger than 
80 years or 80 years and older), sex, time since fracture 
(previous three months or longer), and type of fracture 
(proximal femur, distal forearm, clinical vertebral, or 
other). 

The allocation programme was written by the trial 
programmer 
the allocation remained 
concealed until the ﬁnal analyses (other than for 
conﬁdential reports to the data monitoring committee). All 
outcomes were reported or veriﬁed by people who were 
masked to the allocation scheme. 
Compliance was measured by a postal questionnaire 
sent every 4 months, in which participants were asked 
how many days of the past 7 days they had taken tablets. A 
randomly selected 10% sample (525 participants) was 
asked to return unused tablets for pill counting. 375 (71%) 
individuals returned pills. 
Intake of dietary calcium and vitamin D was assessed 
by food-frequency questionnaires based on those of 
Nelson10 and the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey,4 
respectively; sunlight exposure was assessed by a 
question about time spent outdoors during different 
seasons. 
25-OH-vitamin D3 was quantiﬁed after extraction from 
plasma by use of straight-phase high-performance liquid 
chromatography11 (lower detection limit 3 ng/mL). Intra- 
assay coefﬁcient of variation (CV) was less than 10% and 
the range 
interassay CV was 
10–40 ng/mL. Intact parathyroid hormone was measured 
by immunometric assay (Nichols Institute, San Juan, 
Capistrano, CA, USA) with a detection 
limit of 
0·5 pmol/L, and inter-assay and intra-assay CV of less 
than 5% in the range 1–40 pmol/L. Independent analysis 



of the tablets was done by Tepnel Scientiﬁc Services, 
Edinburgh, UK. 

The time interval from randomisation to trial closure 
was between 24 and 62 months (median 45, IQR 37–52). 
The principal outcome measure was all-new low-energy 
including clinical, radiologically conﬁrmed 
fractures 
vertebral fractures, but not those of the face or skull. Data 
for further fractures and deaths were obtained from 
several sources: postal questionnaires every 4 months with 
telephone follow-up if needed; hospital and general- 
relatives of 
practice staff; nominated 
participants; and national routine data-collection systems 
of the UK Ofﬁce of National Statistics, the Information 
and Statistics Division (Scotland), and the Hospital 
Episode Statistics gathered by the Department of Health in 
England. Conﬁrmation of fracture was always sought 
from a second source. Moreover, data for health status (as 
assessed by Short-Form 1212 and Euroqol-5D),13 hospital 
admission, change of residence, falls, and possible adverse 
events were obtained from the postal questionnaires and 
were supplemented by further clinical information on 
potentially serious adverse events. Differential effects on 
falls were assessed by one question in every questionnaire: 
“Have you fallen during the last week?”. In two trial 
centres (Southampton, and Newcastle-Upon-Tyne), a 
sample of participants had blood taken for assessment of 
25-OH-vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone before 
starting supplementation and 1 year after randomisation. 
Statistical analysis 
The sample size was based on a factorial design to test 
calcium versus no calcium and vitamin D3 versus no 
vitamin D3. The anticipated incidence of new fractures in 
the control group was 15%, based on similar trials. The 
aim was to enrol 4200 participants to give 80% power 
(2P(cid:2)0·05) to detect a decrease in incidence to 12%. 
Furthermore, the sample size was anticipated to have over 
80% power to identify a 2% absolute difference in rates of 
hip fracture. Initially, 6500 participants were sought, on 
the basis of expected losses to follow-up of 35%. However, 
this number was adjusted during recruitment (June, 2001) 
to 5200 participants on the basis of a higher rate of 
retention. An independent data and safety monitoring 
committee met yearly, and on each occasion recom- 
mended continuation to achieve maximum recruitment. 
Analysis was done 2 years after the last person was 
recruited and was based on intention-to-treat. Dichoto- 
mous outcomes (ie, yes/no questions from the ques- 
tionnaire) were analysed over 24 months by use of logistic 
regression, and over the total duration of follow-up by use 
of Cox regression. Quality-of-life outcomes were examined 
by ANCOVA, with adjustment for 4-month quality-of-life 
scores as baseline. All analyses were adjusted for 
minimisation variables. Interaction between calcium and 
vitamin D3 was tested for. Previously speciﬁed subgroup 
analyses were done after stratiﬁcation by: high or low 
weight (less than 55 kg or not); latitude of recruitment 



centre (northern, central [south of Durham and north of 
London], or southern); dietary calcium (high [(cid:3)700 mg 
per day], moderate [400–699 mg per day], or low [(cid:2)400 mg 
per day]); and vitamin D exposure from the sun or diet 
(high or low [ie, participants did or did not go outdoors or 
had a dietary intake of less than 200 IU vitamin D per day, 
respectively]). Analysis based on compliance status (still 
taking tablets on (cid:4)80% days at 2 years or not) was also 
done, with tests for treatment by subgroup interactions. 
The main outcome was subdivided into categories of 
fracture to investigate possible differential effects. Stricter 
levels of signiﬁcance (2P(cid:2)0·01) were sought because of 
the exploratory nature of the analyses. 


Role of the funding source 
The UK Medical Research Council funded the central 
organisation of RECORD, and Shire Pharmaceuticals 
funded 
and 
manufactured by Nycomed. Shire Pharmaceuticals and 
Nycomed were given the opportunity to comment on the 
penultimate version of the trial report. No funding source 
had any role in the collection, management, analysis, or 
interpretation of the data; writing of the report; or the 
decision to submit the paper for publication. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the 
study and had ﬁnal responsibility 
to submit for 
publication. 
We have adhered to the principles outlined in the 
randomised 
for 
CONSORT 
controlled trials,14 and to those outlined by McAlister and 
colleagues15 for reporting of factorial designs. 


The protocol for this study was peer reviewed and 
accepted by The Lancet; a summary of the protocol was 
published on the journal’s website, and the journal then 
made a commitment to peer-review the primary clinical 
manuscript. 
Results 
Figure 1 shows the trial proﬁle. Of 15 024 people assessed, 
about a third joined the trial and about 3500 of those who 
were eligible did not participate. Those recruited were 
younger (mean age 77 years [SD 6]) than were those who 
declined (80 years [6]) or who were ineligible (82 years [7]). 
The main reasons for 
ineligibility were cognitive 
[43·0%]), current antiosteoporotic 
impairment (2666

treatment (2103 
[33·9%]), and previous excluding 
cancer (680 [11·0%]); this group also had a higher 
incidence of previous proximal-femur fracture than 
those recruited (2239 vs 904 [36·1% vs 17·1%]). Table 1 
shows baseline characteristics. Half 
initial 
notiﬁcations of further fractures came from responses 
to the participant questionnaire alone and half from 
other sources. 

Postal-questionnaire data for compliance and quality 
of life after excluding deaths were available for 4514 
(86·6%) of 5210 participants at 4 months, 3991 (78·7%) 
of 5068 at 12 months, and for 3591 (74·2%) of 4841 at 
24 months. Based on questionnaire responses at 
24 months, 2886 (54·5%) of 5292 were still taking 
tablets, 451 (8·5%) had died, 58 (1·1%) had withdrawn, 
and 1897 (35·8%) had stopped tablets but were still 
providing data on at least the main outcome measures. 
Table 2 shows compliance at 24 months. Throughout 
the trial about 80% of those taking tablets did so on 
more than 80% of days, which is consistent with pill 
counts in the subsample (data not shown). However, 
the number who were taking any tablets fell over time. 
At 4 months, 3398 (68·7%) of the 4949 who returned 
questionnaires had taken pills on more than 80% of 
days (or 3398 [65·2%] of 5210 after assuming non- 
responders were non-compliers and excluding known 
deaths). The equivalent ﬁgures up to 12 months were 
2554 of 4251 (60·1%) or 2554 of 5068 (50·4%), and up 
to 24 months were 2268 of 3765 (60·2%) or 2268 of 
4841 (46·8%).

groups who complied with treatment (ie, per protocol 
analysis). Overall, 761 (14·4%) participants reported

not differ signiﬁcantly in this respect. Table 4 shows no 
difference in quality of life at 4 months and at 2 years.

value of 372 IU vitamin D3 per tablet (SD 38). 
The mean baseline concentration of 25(OH) vitamin D3 
for a sample of 60 participants was 15·2 ng/mL (SD 6·5). 
After 1 year of supplementation, concentrations rose by 
9·6 ng/mL (6·9) for participants allocated combination 
treatment, 9·7 ng/mL (8·7) for participants allocated 
vitamin D3, 1·4 ng/mL (5·7) for those assigned calcium, 
and by 3·1 ng/mL (7·2) for those allocated placebo.

Poor compliance with calcium tablets (table 2; difference 
9·4%, 95% CI 6·6–12·2) was associated with more 
frequent decisions to stop because of gastrointestinal 
symptoms or difﬁculties 
tablets. 
Furthermore, gastrointestinal symptoms were the main 
reason why more people allocated calcium than those 
allocated vitamin D3 reported possible side-effects (428 
[16·4%] for those assigned calcium vs 319 [11·9%] for 
those not; 363 [13·7%] for people assigned vitamin D3 vs 
386 [14·5%] for those not). Possible serious adverse effects 
were rare: renal insufﬁciency (seven participants), renal 
stones (four) and hypercalcaemia (21) and did not differ 
between the groups (data not shown). At 1 year, 35 (3·5%) 
of 997 of participants allocated placebo were taking drugs 
active on bone (mainly bisphosphonates), and 20 (2·0%) 
participants allocated placebo were taking prescribed 
calcium or vitamin D either alone or in combination. At 
2 years, 40 (4·5%) of 892 participants assigned placebo 
were taking bone-active drugs and 25 (2·8%) were taking 
open calcium or vitamin D either alone or in combination. 
These rates were similar in the calcium and vitamin D 
groups. 
Overall, 698 (13%) participants had a new low-trauma 
fracture, 183 (4%) of whom had a hip fracture. 331 
(12·6%) of 2617 participants allocated calcium had a new 
low-trauma fracture compared with 367 (14%) of 
2675 participants not allocated calcium (hazard ratio [HR] 
0·94 [0·81–1·09]). The incidence of new low-trauma 
fractures did not differ signiﬁcantly between those 
allocated vitamin D3 and those who were not (table 3 and 
ﬁgure 2), or between those allocated combination 
treatment and those allocated placebo (HR for interaction 
term 1·01 [0·75–1·36]). No differences were seen between 
the trial groups with respect to the incidence of all 
fractures, radiographically conﬁrmed 
fractures, hip 
fractures, other types of fracture; death; and time to 
fracture or death (table 3). Moreover, there was no 
evidence of differential effects on fracture risk or that 
calcium or vitamin D3 had an effect in the previously

Similarly, a subsample of 60 participants had mean 
baseline concentrations of parathyroid hormone of 
5·5 pmol/L (11 [19%] of whom had a concentration of 
(cid:4)6·9 pmol/L, SD 2·4), which decreased by 1·9 pmol/L 
(2·2) for participants assigned combination treatment, 
0·7 (1·6) for vitamin D3, 1·6 (1·6) for calcium, and by 
0·7 (1·5) for placebo. 
Discussion 
In this trial of secondary-fracture prevention, incidence 
of fractures did not differ between those allocated any 
calcium versus no calcium, between those allocated any 
vitamin D3 versus no vitamin D3, or between those 
allocated combination treatment versus placebo. 
As expected, the rate of further low-trauma fracture was 
high (one in eight). However, there were fewer hip 
fractures than anticipated, which was related to the 
tendency for older people to be ineligible because of 
cognitive impairment (43% of participants in this trial) or 
because they had already been prescribed bone-active 
drugs (34%). Both these groups are likely to be at higher 
risk of further fractures than participants in this trial. Few 
participants were enrolled after a vertebral fracture, and 
such patients might be more responsive to treatment.16 A 
possible explanation for the ﬁndings is that true 
differences were underestimated because of chance. The 
trial was large, involving more than 5000 participants with 
a minimum follow-up of 24 months, and 698 had at least

living in the community. Therefore, the participants in 
our trial might have been less likely to have vitamin D 
insufﬁciency and secondary hyperparathyroidism than 
those in the trials by Chapuy and colleagues. Our 
participants were, however, older than were participants 
in Dawson-Hughes’ trial. Concentrations of 25-OH- 
vitamin D3 achieved with supplementation seem lower in 
our trial than 
in these other trials,18,22–25 although 
differences in analytical techniques make comparisons 
difﬁcult. We also showed less suppression of parathyroid 
hormone than did others,22,23,25 but more suppression than 
in a later trial.25 The amount of vitamin D needed to 
ensure optimum blood concentrations of 25-OH- 
vitamin D3 and parathyroid hormone is debatable. As 
much as 4000 IU per day has been suggested,26 but this 
amount has yet to be tested in a fracture-prevention trial. 
Secondary-fracture prevention is now widely practised. 
Our trial indicates that routine supplementation with 
calcium and vitamin D3, either alone or in combination, is 
not effective in the prevention of further fractures in 
people who have had a recent low-trauma fracture. 
Secondary analyses did not identify subgroups that might 
beneﬁt from supplementation, such as those individuals 
(17% of those enrolled) who had had a hip fracture before 
enrolment. These participants were older 
(mean 
79·4 years [SD 6·3] vs 77·0 [5·3]) and twice as likely to die 
(28% vs 15%) during the trial than those with a non-hip 
fracture. Policies 
for secondary prevention should 
strategies. The main 
therefore 
pharmacological intervention is antiresorptive drugs, such 
as bisphosphonates, which have rarely been assessed in 
patients who have not been taking calcium or vitamin D. 


This trial was not designed to directly address whether 
supplementation should be used as a primary-prevention 
measure or in those who live in a care-home environment. 
Clariﬁcation of the role of supplementation in these 
settings awaits the results of other trials.

one new low-trauma fracture. At the start of the trial the 
aim was to identify a 20% relative difference (3% absolute 
difference). The lower ends of the 95% CI around the HR 
for the principal analyses were 0·805 for calcium and 
0·879 for vitamin D3, indicating that a true effect of that 
size is very unlikely, on the basis of these results. 
As expected, it was difﬁcult to maintain compliance with 
allocated tablets: participants were elderly, usually taking 
other medications, and comorbidity was common. By the 
time data collection had stopped, one in six had died. By 
2 years, compliance (deﬁned as a participant who took 
(cid:4)80% of tablets) was 60% of those who returned 
questionnaires. All analyses were based on the intention- 
to-treat principle, and so effectiveness in this context 
rather than efﬁcacy was measured. Comparison of 
compliance in this trial with that of other trials is difﬁcult 
because rates of compliance with tablets and drop-outs are 
often not well reported. There were different rates of 
questionnaire response in the trial groups, especially for 
comparisons of calcium because of increased rates of 
possible side-effects in these groups. Although imbal- 
ances in the response rate in different groups could 
introduce bias into comparisons that are based only on 
questionnaire responses (eg, quality of life), this bias 
seems unlikely for fractures and deaths because these data 
were derived from several sources and the pattern of 
results was similar 
the source of 
identiﬁcation. 

There was no evidence that supplementation might be 
especially useful for speciﬁc groups (ﬁgure 3) or that true 
differences could have been obscured by poor compliance. 
A possible mechanism for fracture prevention was a 
reduced incidence of falls. For pragmatic reasons, we 
chose to address this issue through one question in every 
follow-up questionnaire that was sent every 4 months 
asking about falls during the previous week. Although this 
method undoubtedly underestimated true rates of falls, 
there was no evidence of any difference between groups. 
The results for participants assigned vitamin D3 alone 
and those assigned calcium alone are consistent with an 
overview of similar trials in that they suggest no 
signiﬁcant effect.7,17 However, results of individual trials 
using vitamin D vary. In a primary-prevention trial of a 
single dose of 100 000 IU oral vitamin D every 4 months, 
Trivedi and colleagues18 reported a marginally signiﬁcant 
22% beneﬁcial effect. However, primary-prevention 
trials19,20 of 400 IU oral vitamin D3 taken every day have 
shown no signiﬁcant effect on the incidence of all types of 
fracture. A UK study21 of 9000 healthy mobile older 
women and men showed no reduction in fracture risk 
after three injections of 300 000 IU vitamin D3 per year. 
By contrast with Chapuy and colleagues’22–24 and 
Dawson-Hughes’25 primary-prevention trials, we did not 
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of combined calcium and vitamin 
D3 on fracture prevention. However, our study population 
was younger and less frail than were the participants in 
Chapuy and co-workers’ trials, and most were mobile and
