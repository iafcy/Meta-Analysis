IMPORTANCE While vitamin D supplementation and exercise are recommended for 
prevention of falls for older people, results regarding these 2 factors are contradictory. 
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of targeted exercise training and vitamin D 
supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls among older women. 
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
vitamin D and open exercise trial conducted between April 2010 and March 2013 in Tampere, 
Finland. Participants were 409 home-dwelling women 70 to 80 years old. The main inclusion 
criteria were at least 1 fall during the previous year, no use of vitamin D supplements, and no 
contraindication to exercise. 
INTERVENTIONS Four study groups, including placebo without exercise, vitamin D (800 IU/d) 
without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D (800 IU/d) and exercise. 
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Injurious 
falls and the number of fallers and injured fallers were reported as secondary outcomes. In 
addition, bone density, physical functioning (muscle strength, balance, and mobility), and 
vitamin D metabolism were assessed. 
RESULTS Intent-to-treat analyses showed that neither vitamin D nor exercise reduced falls. 
Fall rates per 100 person-years were 118.2, 132.1, 120.7, and 113.1 in the placebo without 
exercise, vitamin D without exercise, placebo and exercise, and vitamin D and exercise study 
groups, respectively; however, injurious fall rates were 13.2, 12.9, 6.5, and 5.0, respectively. 
Hazard ratios for injured fallers were significantly lower among exercisers with vitamin D 
(0.38; 95% CI, 0.17-0.83) and without vitamin D (0.47; 95% CI, 0.23-0.99). Vitamin D 
maintained femoral neck bone mineral density and increased tibial trabecular density slightly. 
However, only exercise improved muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D did not enhance 
exercise effects on physical functioning. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The rate of injurious falls and injured fallers more than halved 
with strength and balance training in home-dwelling older women, while neither exercise nor 
vitamin D affected the rate of falls. Exercise improved physical functioning. Future research is 
needed to determine the role of vitamin D in the enhancement of strength, balance, and 
mobility. 





fractures in older adults. Although less than 1 in 10 falls 
results in a fracture, approximately 20% of falls lead to 
injury requiring medical attention.1 Therefore, fall preven- 
tion is widely considered the most essential element in in- 
jury and fracture prevention programs in elderly populations.2,3 
There is strong high-quality evidence from randomized clini- 
cal trials and subsequent systematic reviews and meta- 
analyses that regular strength and balance training can re- 
duce the risk of falling in community-dwelling older adults by 
15% to 50%.4,5 
Vitamin D, in turn, is known to be vital for bone metabo- 
lism and health. Insufficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 
(25[OH]D) levels are associated with increased bone loss and 
risk of fractures as well as increased fall rates. Furthermore, 
it has been suggested that those with low 25(OH)D levels 
have lower physical performance and greater declines in 
physical functioning.6,7 However, systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses of clinical trials exploring the role of vitamin 
D in reducing falls and fractures in community-dwelling 
older people and in improving physical functioning are 
inconclusive.8-11 
The aim of this study was to investigate the separate and 
combined effects of multimodal exercise training and vita- 
min D supplementation in reducing falls and injurious falls and 
fallers as well as to assess their effects in improving bone den- 
sity and physical functioning among older women at risk for 
falling. 


Trial Design 
This study was a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled vi- 
tamin D and open exercise intervention trial with 4 arms 
(Figure 1). The trial was performed between April 2010 and 
March 2013. Eligibility criteria and recruitment of partici- 
pants have been described in detail previously.12 Briefly, home- 
dwelling women 70 to 80 years old living in Tampere, Fin- 
land, were eligible if they had fallen at least once during the 
previous 12 months, did not use vitamin D supplements, and 
had no contraindications to exercise. Individuals who partici- 
pated in moderate to vigorous exercise more than 2 hours per 
week were excluded from the study. 
The study protocol was approved by the ethics commit- 
tee of the Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland 
(approval R09090). The study protocol can be found in the 
trial protocol in Supplement 1. Each participant provided 
written informed consent before randomization. The study 
protocol is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (identifier 
NCT00986466). 
Setting and Participants 
In total, 409 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 
groups using a computer-generated list based on simple ran- 
domization with random allocation sequence to ensure equal 
group sizes. The groups were (1) placebo without exercise,

the tibia were assessed with peripheral quantitative com- 
puted tomography (XCT 3000; Norland/Stratec).16 
Participants received one daily pill containing 800 IU 
(20 μg) of vitamin D3 or placebo for 24 months (trial protocol 
in Supplement 1).12 All tablets were provided by Oy Verman 
Ab (Kerava, Finland) and were similar in size, appearance, 
and taste. Each participant received a pack of pills for 6 
months at a time. Used packs were returned at the time of 
laboratory measurements every 6 months, and new full 
packs were given. The compliance was confirmed by pill 
counts. 
Exercise consisted of supervised, progressive group train- 
ing classes 2 times a week for the first 12 months and once a 
week for the remaining 12 months of the 24-month interven- 
tion (trial protocol in Supplement 1).12 Training periods alter- 
nating between exercise hall and gym classes were led by phys- 
iotherapists (R.P. and S.K.), who also monitored attendance. 
Exercise hall classes focused on balance challenging, weight 
bearing, strengthening, agility, and functional exercises. Gym 
classes included a combination of pin-loaded weight ma- 
chines, pulleys, and free weights, beginning with 30% to 60% 
of one repetition maximum and progressing to a target level 
of 60% to 75% of one repetition maximum. Exercise intensity 
was estimated in metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) every 8 
weeks (version 3.0.1.0; Firstbeat Technologies). The exercis- 
ers also had a home-training program (5-15 minutes), modi- 
fied from the supervised exercises, to be performed on all rest 
days. The nonexercising groups were asked to maintain their 
prestudy level of physical activity. 
Outcome Measures 
The primary outcome was monthly reported falls. Secondary 
outcomes included injurious falls, the number of fallers and 
injured fallers, bone density, and physical functioning (muscle 
strength, balance, and mobility). 
The number of falls was obtained from prospective fall dia- 
ries returned monthly via mail, and details of each registered 
fall were ascertained by a telephone call. A fall was defined as 
“an unexpected event in which the participant comes to rest 
on the ground, floor or lower level.”13(p1619) Injurious falls were 
those for which participants sought medical care (nurse, phy- 
sician, or hospital) and included injuries such as bruises, abra- 
sions, contusions, sprains, fractures, and head injuries. Less 
injurious falls for which medical treatment was not sought were 
not included in the analysis. 
Data Collection 
All measurements were obtained at baseline, 12 months, and 
24 months. Blood samples and physical functioning were also 
assessed at 6 months and 18 months. Assessors were blinded 
to group assignments. 
Body height and weight were measured with standard 
methods. Dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D was as- 
sessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire.14 
Physical functioning was assessed by the Short Physical 
Performance Battery,17 which comprised static balance, 4-m 
normal walking speed, and 5-time chair stand tests and by the 
Timed Up and Go (TUG) test.18 Dynamic balance was as- 
sessed using backward walking.19 Maximal isometric leg ex- 
tensor strength at a knee angle of 110° was measured by a strain 
gauge dynamometer (custom made; Tamtron). Each partici- 
pant recorded her daily steps with a pedometer (HJ-112-E; Om- 
ron) over the entire 24-month study period. All tests are regu- 
larly used in our laboratory and have good reproducibility. 
Analysis of 25(OH)D and Parathyroid Hormone Levels 
Fasting serum 25(OH)D level was measured as a marker of vi- 
tamin D metabolism with an immunoenzymometric assay 
(Octeia; IDS). Reproducibility was ensured by adhering to the 
Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme (DEQAS; http: 
//deqas.kpmd.co.uk). The laboratory received the DEQAS pro- 
ficiency certificate in 2012. Interassay variation was avoided 
by measuring all samples from the same individuals in the same 
series. Serum intact parathyroid hormone was measured with 
an automated immunoassay (Immuliate 1000; Siemens Health- 
care Diagnostics). 
Randomization and Blinding 
The participants were enrolled by the corresponding author. 
The study statistician (K.T.) generated the participant list 
using validated randomization software. He was blinded to 
the study participants and their characteristics and ran- 
domly allocated them into 4 groups (simple randomization). 
The participants and study personnel were blinded to the 
vitamin D treatment group assignments. The randomization 
codes were opened after the data collection was completed 
and checked. 
Statistical Analysis 
Power calculations indicated that a sample size of 260 (130 
exercisers and 130 nonexercisers) would have an 80% power 
to detect a 30% between-group difference in the rate of falls 
during the 2-year intervention with a significance level of 
α = .05. However, to eliminate the role of chance in detect- 
ing the possible interaction of vitamin D and exercise, 400 
participants (100 in each group) were recruited into the 
study. 
All data were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. Fol- 
low-up times for falls, fallers and injurious falls, and injured 
fallers were calculated from the beginning to the end of the 
24-month intervention unless the participant withdrew from 
the study or died. Pairwise multiple comparisons with Sidak 
adjustment were first used to test the differences among treat- 
ment groups and interaction between vitamin D and exer- 
cise. Sidak adjustment enables the simultaneous pairwise com- 
parison of multiple groups. 
Body composition and areal bone mineral density (BMD) 
of the lumbar spine and left proximal femur were assessed using 
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy Advance; GE 
Healthcare).15 Distal site (5%) and the mid-diaphysis (50%) of 
Fall incidence rates were calculated as the total number 
of falls divided by the time over which falls were monitored 
(100 person-years) in each group. Negative binomial regres- 
sion was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios for falls and

were used to calculate hazard ratios for fallers and injured fall- 
ers in each group, with the placebo without exercise group as 
the reference. 
For physical functioning and bone traits, between-group 
differences in time were estimated by linear mixed models 
for normally distributed outcomes and by generalized linear 
mixed models with gamma distribution and log link func- 
tion for nonnormally distributed outcomes using age, 
height, weight, and the use of hormone therapy as covari- 
ates. These methods allowed the incorporation of incom- 
plete longitudinal data into the analysis. All statistical analy- 
ses were conducted using a software program (SPSS, version 
22; IBM). 

There were no clinically relevant between-group differences 
in age or anthropometry at baseline (Table 1). Body composi- 
tion did not change significantly during the trial. The mean (SD) 
daily dietary calcium intake was sufficient at 1098 (378) mg at 
baseline and 1212 (400) mg at 24 months. The mean (SD) daily 
dietary vitamin D intake was 10.4 (3.9) μg at baseline and 10.5 
(4.3) μg at the end of the intervention. Alcohol consumption 
was low, and 13 women were current smokers. Fifty-three 
women (13.0%) were taking no medication, while 87.0% had 
at least 1 diagnosed chronic disease, most commonly cardio- 
vascular.

Thirty-nine women (9.5%) did not complete the end point 
measurements, with most citing health reasons, and 4 women 
died (Figure 1). The mean pill compliance was 98.1% (range, 
42.6%-100%), while the mean exercise compliance (mea- 
sured as attendance at all offered training sessions for group 
and home training) was 72.8% (range, 0%-97.4%) and 66.1% 
(0%-100%), respectively. The mean intensity of supervised 
training ranged from 1.6 METs (stretching or resting) to 5.6 
METs. Individual maximal values were more than 7 METs. 
In general, the training program was well tolerated. There 
were no severe adverse effects or injuries due to the training. 
Twenty-two participants from the exercise groups and 1 par- 
ticipant from the nonexercise groups consulted the attend- 
ing physician (P.K.) because of musculoskeletal complaints, 
mainly mild overuse symptoms (eTable in Supplement 2). In 
addition, 3 injuries occurred during the gym training. Three 
exercisers withdrew from training during the first weeks of the 
program because of preexisting osteoarthritic symptoms. 
Vitamin D levels differed significantly between the vita- 
min D and placebo groups. The mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D lev- 
els remained stable in the placebo groups at 27.5 (7.4) ng/mL 
at baseline and 27.5 (6.9) ng/mL at 24 months, with small sea- 
sonal variation, while the mean (SD) levels increased in the vi- 
tamin D groups from 25.1 (6.9) ng/mL at baseline to 37.0 (7.4) 
ng/mL at 24 months (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2) (to convert 
serum 25[OH]D level to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496). 
Small seasonal variations were observed in serum intact para- 
thyroid hormone in the placebo groups, while that in the vi- 
tamin D groups declined slightly from baseline, remaining 
stable thereafter. 
No interaction was found between vitamin D and exer- 
cise. In total, there were 928 falls and 281 fallers, with no be- 
tween-group differences (the rate of falls is summarized in 
Table 2). However, hazard ratios for injured fallers were lower 
in both exercise groups compared with the placebo without 
exercise group. Hazard ratios were 0.47 (95% CI, 0.23-0.99) for 
the placebo and exercise group and 0.38 (95% CI, 0.17-0.83) for 
the vitamin D and exercise group. The vitamin D without ex- 
ercise group did not differ from the placebo without exercise 
group (Figure 2). Results were similar for the incidence rate ra- 
tios of injurious falls (Table 2). The numbers of multiple fall- 
ers (n = 190) and multiple injured fallers (n = 117) were distrib- 
uted similarly across the groups. 
During the intervention, femoral neck BMD declined in all 
groups, but the mean decline was greatest in the placebo with- 
out exercise group and differed significantly from that in all 
other study groups (Table 3). Lumbar spine BMD did not change 
significantly in any group. Vitamin D increased trabecular bone 
density at the tibia slightly but significantly between the vi- 
tamin D and exercise group and the placebo without exercise 
group (P = .02). 
The mean (SD) number of daily steps was 5930 (2512) over 
the entire study period, with no between-group differences. 
Individual daily steps ranged from 1200 to 16 500. 
Changes in physical functioning are summarized in Table 3 
and eFigure 2 in Supplement 2. Normal walking speed was 
maintained in the placebo and exercise group compared with 
the placebo without exercise group (P = .007), while declin- 
ing similarly in other groups. Chair stand time improved in both 
exercise groups, showing more than 6% improvement com- 
pared with the placebo without exercise group but reaching 
statistical significance only in the placebo and exercise group 
(P = .03). The TUG time deteriorated significantly more in the 
vitamin D without exercise group compared with the placebo 
without exercise group (P = .01). Other groups did not differ 
from the placebo without exercise group. Backward walking 
improved significantly among exercisers. The difference com- 
pared with the placebo without exercise group was statisti- 
cally significant in the placebo and exercise group (P = .001) 
and in the vitamin D and exercise group (P = .03). Irrespec- 
tive of vitamin D, exercise increased muscle strength, while 
vitamin D alone had no effect. The predicted mean increase 
in lower limb extension strength was almost 15% in both ex- 
ercise groups and differed significantly from the placebo with- 
out exercise group (P < .001). 

This large randomized clinical trial of vitamin D and exer- 
cise showed that exercise training reduced injurious falls 
among home-dwelling older women, while the rate of falls 
was not affected by either treatment. Exercise improved 
physical functioning but vitamin D did not (contrary to ini- 
tial expectations). However, vitamin D reduced bone loss at 
the femoral neck and increased trabecular density at the 
distal tibia. 
Current evidence for the effectiveness of vitamin D in fall 
prevention is inconsistent, most likely because of varying study 
designs and baseline 25(OH)D levels as well as different dos-

ages or types of vitamin D supplements used. According to 
some experts, an adequate serum 25(OH)D level should be at 
least 30 ng/mL,20,21 while many guidelines consider 20 ng/mL 
to be sufficient.22 We aimed to recruit participants from the gen- 
eral population regardless of vitamin D status, and serum 25 
(OH)D levels were measured only after randomization. 
creased the number of injured fallers. Apparently, this effect 
was attributable to improved physical functioning. Muscle 
strength and balance training has been shown to prevent falls 
in community-dwelling older adults, and recent meta- 
analyses have confirmed that such exercise programs are ef- 
fective in preventing fall-induced injuries.3,27 
There is also inconclusive evidence on whether vitamin 
D could modulate physical functioning.4,8 In a population- 
based survey of men and women 60 years or older, a higher 
25(OH)D level was associated with better neuromuscular 
function.7 Surprisingly, chair stand test performance ap- 
peared to decline at the highest 25(OH)D levels exceeding 120 
nmol/L (>48 ng/mL),7 possibly because of few observations in 
the highest category. This finding needs confirmation. In trials 
using high dosages of vitamin D, high 25(OH)D levels have in- 
creased the risk of falls and fractures, suggesting negative in- 
fluences on balance and mobility.23,24 Little is known about the 
combined effects of vitamin D and exercise. Results of 2 pilot 
studies25,26 have suggested a positive influence. In frail el- 
derly patients with acute hip fracture, Bischoff-Ferrari et al9 
reported that vitamin D treatment reduced hospital readmis- 
sion but not falls, whereas physiotherapy was successful in re- 
ducing falls but not hospital readmission. An effect on falls was 
found in the physical therapy group, although gains in physi- 
cal functioning were found only among participants adher- 
ent to the physiotherapy home program. 
Exercise improved muscle strength, balance, and mobil- 
ity except for the TUG time. Surprisingly, vitamin D seemed 
to worsen the TUG time. Similarly, although normal walking 
speed was maintained in both exercise groups with or with- 
out vitamin D, the vitamin D without exercise group showed 
the greatest decline. Another unexpected finding was that ex- 
ercisers treated with vitamin D supplementation showed con- 
sistently smaller benefits than exercisers receiving placebo. 
Therefore, our results indicate that vitamin D may not im- 
prove neuromuscular function, at least when vitamin D in- 
take is sufficient. 
Despite improved physical performance, exercise con- 
ferred no effect on the overall fall rate. Recent studies28,29 have 
provided similar results. More falls have been reported among 
exercisers despite improved muscle strength and physical 
performance.28 Nevertheless, in our study, the rate of injuri- 
ous falls and injured fallers more than halved among exercis- 
ers. Good physical condition may help prevent injuries dur- 
ing a fall, perhaps via better and safer landing techniques. This 
trend fully concurs with recent meta-analyses.3,27 
In the present trial, exercise training (irrespective of vita- 
min D supplementation) reduced injurious falls and de- 
Exercise training was primarily intended to improve bal- 
ance, muscle strength, and mobility rather than bone density

because limited physical capacity or comorbidities of partici- 
pants were likely to restrict the intensity or type of loading 
needed to strengthen bone. Nevertheless, both vitamin D 
groups showed increased trabecular bone density in the tibia, 
suggesting that the mean 25(OH)D levels were sufficient for a 
skeletal effect (84.6% of participants in both vitamin D groups 
exceeded the target level of ≥30 ng/mL).20 Although vitamin 
D and exercise (alone or in combination) could not increase 
femoral neck BMD, both treatments reduced bone loss at this 
clinically relevant bone site. 
This study has several strengths. To our knowledge, it is 
the first large randomized clinical trial with a long (2-year) du- 
ration that was double-blinded to vitamin D status, evaluat- 
ing the effectiveness of vitamin D and exercise training in pre- 
venting falls and related injuries in older women. Second, 
withdrawal from the study was low at only 9.5%. Third, pill 
compliance was excellent, and participation in exercise train- 
ing was good. Fourth, falls were assessed monthly using fall 
diaries, and all reported falls were scrutinized by the investi- 
gators. Fifth, physical functioning and bone traits were com- 
prehensively assessed. Furthermore, when planning our trial, 
there was no consensus on the definition of injurious falls. In 
2012, Schwenk et al30 proposed a classification, and our defi- 
nition conforms with this recommendation. 
There were also limitations to our study. Because of the 
fortification of fluid milk products in Finland, the baseline 25 
(OH)D levels were likely too high to reveal all potential ben- 
eficial effects of the vitamin. It is possible that vitamin D has 
greater effects on fall risk among women with vitamin D 
depletion.9,10,31 On the other hand, all participants had fallen 
previously and thus were at increased risk of falling, and vi- 
tamin D supplementation is now recommended as a means to 
reduce the risk of falls irrespective of baseline vitamin D lev- 
els. Although the exercise program was planned to be suit- 
able and safe for women with musculoskeletal problems, it was 
challenging to reach and recruit the frailest women. In other 
words, our participants were in good health and physical con- 
dition. Therefore, our results cannot be generalized to frail and 
institutionalized women or to men. 

Given the fact that fall risk is multifactorial, exercise may be 
the most effective and feasible strategy for preventing injuri- 
ous falls in community-dwelling older adults replete with 
vitamin D. Herein, vitamin D increased bone density slightly, 
and exercise improved physical functioning. While neither 
treatment reduced the rate of falling, injurious falls more 
than halved among exercisers with or without vitamin D. 
Our participants were vitamin D replete, with sufficient cal- 
cium intake. Future research is needed to elaborate the role 
of vitamin D to enhance physical functioning in elderly 
women.
