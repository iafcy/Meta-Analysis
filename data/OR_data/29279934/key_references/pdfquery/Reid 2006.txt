PURPOSE: 
Calcium has been shown to have positive effects on bone mineral density in postmenopausal 
women. However, these effects are small, it is unknown whether they are sustained with long-term use, 
they have not been shown with intention-to-treat analyses, and the evidence for fracture prevention with 
calcium monotherapy is inconsistent. 
METHODS: 
A randomized controlled trial of calcium (1 g/day as the citrate) in 1471 healthy postmeno- 
pausal women (aged 74 (cid:1) 4 years) was performed to assess the effects on bone density and fracture 
incidence over 5 years. 
RESULTS: 
Follow-up was complete in 90% of subjects, and average medication compliance was 55% to 
58%. Calcium had a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect on bone density (intention-to-treat analysis), with 
between-groups differences at 5 years of 1.8% (spine), 1.6% (total hip), and 1.2% (total body). Effects were 
greater in a per-protocol analysis (5-year differences of 2.3%, 2.8%, and 1.8%, respectively). A total of 425 
fractures occurred in 281 women. Hazard ratios, based on time to ﬁrst fracture, were 0.90 (95% conﬁdence 
interval [CI], 0.71-1.16) for any symptomatic fracture, 0.72 (95% CI, 0.44-1.18) for vertebral, 3.55 (95% 
CI, 1.31-9.63) for hip, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.41-1.04) for forearm fracture. Per-protocol analysis found 
respective hazard ratios of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.64-1.17), 0.62 (95% CI, 0.33-1.16), 3.24 (95% CI, 0.65-16.1), 
and 0.45 (95% CI, 0.24-0.87). Height loss was reduced by calcium in the per-protocol population (P (cid:2) .03). 
Serum alkaline phosphatase and procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide were lower in the calcium group 
at 5 years, but constipation was more common. 
CONCLUSIONS: 
Calcium results in a sustained reduction in bone loss and turnover, but its effect on 
fracture remains uncertain. Poor long-term compliance limits its effectiveness. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

Calcium is the principal mineral constituent of bone, and the 
use of calcium supplements has long been advocated for the 
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. There is now 
clinical trial evidence that calcium has positive effects on 
bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.1-3 How- 
ever, these effects have been small and would only be 
clinically signiﬁcant if they were progressive with contin- 
ued use. Because most studies have lasted (cid:1)2 years, this is

not known.4 In addition, most studies have involved modest 
numbers of subjects and not provided intention-to-treat 
analyses, so the quality of the evidence for prevention of 
bone loss by calcium is poor by currently accepted 
standards. 
Several studies of calcium monotherapy have suggested 
that the reduced bone loss in postmenopausal women is 
associated with a reduction in fracture risk of up to one 
half,5-7 but meta-analysis of the available studies does not 
demonstrate convincing evidence for fracture protection.4 
There is also evidence that combined intervention with 
calcium and vitamin D reduces fractures in the elderly.8-11

However, a recent study of 5292 women and men with a 
previous fracture showed no beneﬁt from calcium, vitamin 
D, or their combination.12 Thus, there is substantial uncer- 
tainty regarding the value of both these interventions.

was designed to reassess more rig- 
orously the effects of calcium sup- 
plementation on long-term bone 
loss and fracture incidence in this 
population. 
METHODS 
This is a randomized controlled 
trial 
in healthy postmenopausal 
women that is designed to assess 
the effects of calcium on bone 
density and fracture incidence 
over a period of 5 years. The methods have been de- 
scribed.13 Brieﬂy, subjects were aged more than 55 years, 
not receiving therapy for osteoporosis or taking calcium 
supplements, and free of major ongoing disease. Serum 
creatinine was less than 2.3 mg/dL (0.2 mmol/L), and serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D was greater than 10 (cid:2)g/L (25 nmol/ 
L). Lumbar spine density was not below the age-appropriate 
normal range. Women were recruited by advertisement and 
supplements. 
mail-outs using electoral rolls. Their baseline characteristics 
are shown in Table 1 and were comparable between groups. 
● Daily calcium supplements promote sus- 
tained reduction in bone loss and bone 
turnover 
in normal postmenopausal 
women but do not show clear anti-frac- 
ture efﬁcacy. 
● Constipation may contribute to poor 
long-term compliance, which may, 
in 
turn, limit the effectiveness of calcium 
Protocol 
Treatments were allocated randomly by computer. Sub- 
ject numbers were allocated and 
medication was dispensed by 
staff who had no direct contact 
with the other study staff or the 
subjects. The women received 
either 1 g of elemental calcium 
daily (as citrate) or identical pla- 
cebo in 2 divided doses. Compli- 
ance was assessed by tablet 
counts. 
Subjects who had fractures dur- 
ing the study were advised regard- 
ing the options for prevention of 
future fractures, and many of these 
women started anti-osteoporosis 
therapies and took calcium sup- 
plements. In the latter case, trial 
interventions were discontinued, although follow-up was 
maintained. 
Measurements 
At baseline, 30 months, and 60 months, spine (L1-4), hip, 
and total body scans were carried out, and vertebral 
morphometry was performed with a Lunar Expert dual- 
energy x-ray absorptiometer (GE-Lunar, Madison WI,

software version 1.7). Incident vertebral fractures were 
deﬁned as a decrease in any vertebral height of more than 
20%, provided that the absolute decrease was at least 4 
mm. Each vertebra that met these criteria was reviewed 
by 2 experienced clinicians to ensure that the identiﬁca- 
tion of vertebral margins was correct. 
Subjects were asked at each 6-month visit about frac- 
tures. If reported, the relevant radiograph or report was 
obtained. If a subject reported an episode suggestive of 
fracture but a radiograph had not been taken, then this 
was arranged. Symptomatic vertebral fractures diagnosed 
independently of the study’s assessments were classiﬁed 
as “clinical fractures” as long as they also met the criteria 
for deﬁnition of an incident vertebral fracture. 
Subjects kept a diary of falls. Grip strength was mea- 
sured in triplicate in the dominant hand. Height was 
measured using a Harpenden stadiometer. Serum 25- 
hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were measured at base- 
line by radioimmunoassay (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN). 
Serum total alkaline phosphatase activity, 
iron- 
binding capacity, ferritin, and magnesium were measured 
on a Roche Modular autoanalyzer (Roche, Stockholm, 
Sweden). The Roche Elecsys 2010 platform was used for 
serum osteocalcin, serum (cid:3)-C-terminal 
telopeptide of 
type I collagen ((cid:3)-Crosslaps, Roche Diagnostics, Mann- 
heim, Germany), and serum procollagen type-I N-termi- 
nal propeptide (PINP). Adverse events were recorded at 
each visit, but speciﬁc symptoms were not. 

The study was approved by the local ethics committee, 
and each subject gave written informed consent. The study 
was registered with the Australian Clinical Trials Registry, 
ACTRN 012605000242628. 
Statistics 
The primary end point of the study was the time to ﬁrst 
clinical fracture at any site. Secondary end points were bone 
density and the following fracture subgroups: total vertebral 
fractures, hip fractures, distal forearm fractures, and osteo- 
porotic fractures (comprising all fractures except those of 
the head, hands, feet, and ankles, and resulting from major 
trauma). Pathologic fractures (eg, resulting from local ma- 
lignancy) were excluded from all analyses. Intention-to- 
treat and per protocol analyses were carried out. Because of 
the likelihood that other anti-osteoporotic therapies would 
have much greater effects on bone density and fracture than 
calcium, 
the per-protocol analysis was prespeciﬁed as 
primary. 
The study was powered (80%, with (cid:4)(cid:2) 0.05) to detect a 
40% decrease in fracture rate, because previous studies had 
suggested an effect of this magnitude.5-7 The time to ﬁrst 
fracture was modeled using a Cox proportional hazards 
approach with adjustment for the stratiﬁcation variables 
(age and thiazide use). The proportional hazards assumption 
was veriﬁed, and a log-rank statistic was estimated. Com- 
parisons between treatment and placebo arms were made 
using the Fisher exact test for categoric data and the Student 
unpaired t test for normally distributed continuous vari- 
ables. For adverse events with indistinct individual start and 
stop dates (eg, constipation) the number of individuals ex- 
periencing at 
least one episode was compared between 
groups (Fisher exact test). Events per woman-year also were 
accumulated and presented as rate (95% conﬁdence interval 
[CI]). All analyses were conducted using the programs of 
SAS v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). A P value less than .05 
was considered statistically signiﬁcant, and all tests were

ance was approximately 85% in both treatment groups in 
each 6-month period. When subjects who discontinued trial 
medication are included, compliance over the entire study 
was 58% in the placebo group and 55% in the calcium 
group (P (cid:2) .13). 
Bone Mineral Density 
In the intention-to-treat analyses, calcium supplementation 
had a beneﬁcial effect on densities throughout the skeleton 
(Figure 2). In the spine, there was no loss in the placebo 
group, but an increase of 1.5% in the calcium group at 30 
months. This was maintained until the trial’s end, at which 
time the between-groups difference was 1.8%. The patterns 
of loss were more linear in both the total hip and total body, 
with between-groups differences at 5 years of 1.6% and 
1.2%, respectively. The calcium effect on density was most 
evident in the ﬁrst half of the study. When changes between 
30 and 60 months alone were analyzed, there was no sig- 
niﬁcant treatment effect in the spine and total body, al- 
though there was in the total hip (P (cid:2) .04). 
To determine whether the effect of calcium on density 
was inﬂuenced by dietary calcium intake, a series of break- 
points from 400 to 1000 mg/day were considered. Only 
when the cohort was divided at 800 mg/day, did those with 
lower intakes have larger increases in total hip density in 
response to calcium supplementation (P (cid:2) .007). A similar 
analysis of the inﬂuence of age showed no interaction of age 
with treatment effect. 
Analysis of data from the per-protocol population with 
compliance greater than 60% showed a similar pattern of 
density changes (Figure 3). Between-groups differences at 5 
years were 2.3% in the spine, 2.8% in the hip, and 1.8% in 
the total body. This represents a 64% reduction in bone loss 
at the hip and 59% reduction in total body loss in the 
calcium group. In this analysis, the waning of the effect in 
the second half of the study was much less evident, and the 
between-groups differences increased signiﬁcantly during 
this time at the hip (P (cid:2) .0002) and total body (P (cid:2) .0009), 
suggesting that decreasing compliance contributed to the 
waning effect in the intention-to-treat analysis. 
Fractures 
A total of 425 fractures (204 in the calcium group, 221 in 
the placebo group) occurred in 281 women (134 in the 
calcium group, 147 in the placebo group) during the study. 
The cumulative proportion of all ﬁrst clinical fractures in 
the intention-to-treat population is shown in Figure 4, and 
the hazard ratios for various fracture categories are shown in 
Table 2. For total clinical fractures and osteoporotic frac- 
tures, there was little evidence of a difference between 
groups, although hip fractures were more common in those 
allocated to calcium, and forearm fractures seemed to be 
less common in this group. 
Because of the likelihood that any therapeutic effect of 
calcium would be overshadowed by the effects on bone of 
other medications and illnesses, a per-protocol analysis also

Subject Disposition and Adherence 
Subject disposition is shown in Figure 1. Of the women 
entering the study, noncompletion was attributable to death 
in 63, illness in 103, and personal reasons in 50. Among 
those still taking trial medication at 5 years, tablet compli- 



shown in the lower part of Table 2 and Figure 5, and suggest 
that calcium reduces fractures, although this was only sig- 
niﬁcant for forearm fractures. In the placebo group, 229 
subjects had at least one 6-month period in which compli- 
ance was less than 60%, similar to that of the 240 subjects 
in the calcium group. 
Height loss, a surrogate for vertebral fracture, was linear 
in both groups. At 5 years in the intention-to-treat analysis, 
mean ((cid:1) standard error) loss was 10.3 (cid:1) 0.2 mm in both 
groups (P (cid:2) .46). The per-protocol population with compli- 
ance greater than 60% showed height losses of 9.9 (cid:1) 0.3 
mm in the placebo group and 9.0 (cid:1) 0.3 mm in the calcium 
group (P (cid:2) .03), consistent with the trend to fewer vertebral 
fractures. 
Bone Turnover Markers 
Serum alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in all 
subjects at baseline and 5 years (Figure 6). Values decreased 
more in the calcium group than in the placebo group during 
the study (11% vs 6%, P (cid:3) 0.001. Other markers were 
measured at 5 years only in 80 subjects who were still 
taking study medication (40 chosen randomly from each 
group). PINP levels were 22% lower in the calcium group 
(P (cid:2) .03). Serum osteocalcin and (cid:3)-C-terminal telopeptide 
of type I collagen concentrations were also slightly lower in 
the calcium group than in the placebo group (16% and 15%, 
respectively), but neither of 
these differences was 
signiﬁcant. 
Other Measures 
To assess the possibility that calcium might impact on 
muscle function and the frequency of falls, grip strength was 
assessed at each visit. Baseline mean values were compa- 
rable (placebo, 18.4 kg; calcium, 18.6 kg, P (cid:2) .33). Over the 
study period, grip strength declined by 0.51 (cid:1) 0.14 kg in the 
placebo group and by 1.2 (cid:1) 0.15 kg in the calcium group 
(least squares means (cid:1) standard error, P (cid:2) .04). The inci- 
dence of falls was 595 per 1000 woman-years (95% CI, 
566-626) for calcium, and 585 per 1000 woman-years (95% 
CI, 556-615) for placebo (P (cid:2) .81). 
In the 80 subjects who had serum assessments at 5 years, 
the calcium and placebo groups showed comparable levels 
of iron (18 (cid:1) 6, 18 (cid:1) 4 (cid:2)mol/L), 
iron-binding capacity 
(56 (cid:1) 7, 55 (cid:1) 9 (cid:2)mol/L), ferritin (156 (cid:1) 117, 134 (cid:1) 111 (cid:2)g/ 
L), and magnesium (0.84 (cid:1) 0.08, 0.85 (cid:1) 0.06 mmol/L) 
(mean (cid:1) standard deviation, all P values (cid:4) .4). 
Loss of at least one tooth occurred in 25.6% (95% CI, 
21.5-30.2) of women in the placebo group, compared with 
28.8% (95% CI, 24.4-33.6) in those randomized to calcium 
(P (cid:2) .33). 
Adverse Events 
Constipation was reported by 132 women (18%) in the 
calcium group and by 82 women (11%) allocated to placebo 
(P (cid:2) .0002). Two subjects in the calcium group had urinary 
calculi as did four allocated to placebo. Discontinuation of

hip fractures was no longer found, and the trends elsewhere 
toward beneﬁt with calcium were slightly greater. A further

trial tablets was more common in those allocated to calcium 
(336, compared with 296, P (cid:2) .02). Health reasons were 
more often cited as the reason for tablet discontinuation in 
the calcium group (133, compared with 105 for placebo 
group, P (cid:2) .04). This difference seemed to be fully ac- 
counted for by the increased incidence of constipation in the 
calcium group. 
DISCUSSION 
This study conﬁrms the beneﬁcial effects of calcium sup- 
plementation on bone density in healthy older women. It 
shows that these beneﬁts are present throughout the skele- 
ton, that they are independent of age, and that they are 
present in individuals with both high and low dietary cal- 
cium intakes. These results provide conﬁrmation of similar 
ﬁndings in a number of smaller studies, but the size of the 
present trial allows these conclusions to be reached with 
much greater certainty. In particular, the beneﬁcial effects 
of calcium supplementation on bone density are clearly 
statistically signiﬁcant when analyzed with a rigorous in- 
tention-to-treat approach; most previous studies of calcium 
supplementation have only published data from subjects 
who were protocol- and medication-compliant. The present 
study has the further advantage that its duration is greater 
than that of almost all such studies in the past. This allows 
the time course of the effect of calcium on bone density to 
be assessed more adequately. Although most of the beneﬁ- 
cial effect of calcium on bone density in the spine and total 
body scans occurs in the ﬁrst 30 months in the intention- 
to-treat analysis, there are cumulative beneﬁts evident in the 
proximal femur. The per-protocol analysis, however, shows 
a cumulative beneﬁt over time in both the proximal femur 
and the total body, suggesting that decreasing compliance is 
a major contributor to the apparent plateauing of effect. This 
implies that use of calcium supplementation over longer 
periods is likely to result in even greater effects on bone 
density. 
The bone density ﬁndings are reinforced by the bone 
marker data, which indicate that even after 5 years, a re- 
duction in bone turnover is still present in subjects taking 
calcium. The 3 bone-speciﬁc markers assessed show similar 
degrees of suppression; the fact that this was only statisti- 
cally signiﬁcant for PINP is probably a reﬂection of the 
lesser variability of this measure. Thus, the present study 
establishes more clearly than previously that calcium sup- 
plementation provides a signiﬁcant and sustained reduction 
in bone turnover, which results in modest positive effects on 
density. 
The positive ﬁndings with density in this study contrast 
with the lack of a clear-cut effect of calcium on fracture 
rates. The intention-to-treat analysis would be consistent 
with a small beneﬁcial effect on total numbers of symptom- 
atic fractures. When subjects are censored from the time that 
they developed major protocol violations or became non- 
compliant with study medication, the trends to fracture 
reduction become more marked, but are still not conclusive. 
Thus, the present study leaves the important question of the 
anti-fracture efﬁcacy of calcium unresolved but does rule 


future meta-analysis, because it comprises more women- 
years than the total in the Shea review.4 
The apparent increase in hip fracture incidence in the 
present study is surprising, particularly in light of the ben- 
eﬁcial effects of calcium supplementation on density at the 
total hip and femoral neck. This trend in hip fractures is 
contrary to that seen elsewhere in the skeleton. In light of 
this, and the clear evidence in the literature that calcium 
combined with vitamin D prevents hip fractures,15 it is 
likely that the present result is a chance ﬁnding arising from 
the small numbers of this particular fracture. 
The importance of the issue of the anti-fracture efﬁcacy 
of calcium is attested to by the recent presentation of several 
large studies. The RECORD study12 recruited subjects aged 
more than 70 years with a history of fracture. Median 
follow-up was 45 months. For the calcium intervention, the 
hazard ratio was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.81-1.09). Compliance was 
approximately 50%, and there was signiﬁcant contamina- 
tion from other therapies. This result is similar to that of the 
present study. A study of the same size and duration as the 
present one has recently been presented.16 The intention-to- 
treat analysis showed a relative risk of fracture of 0.85, 
which reduced to 0.66 in the protocol-compliant cohort. 
Both studies are suggestive but not conclusive of a weak 
anti-fracture effect. 
The present study highlights the difﬁculties inherent in 
the use of calcium supplementation, both in the context of a 
clinical trial and in clinical practice. These doses of calcium 
are bulky, usually requiring multiple tablets each day. This 
results in considerable problems with subject adherence, 
complicating trial interpretation and clinical utility. The 
increased incidence of constipation is conﬁrmed in the 
present study and is likely to limit adherence. However, this 
study is reassuring in regard to calcium’s effects on iron and 
magnesium levels, although it ﬁnds no beneﬁt on muscle 
strength, falls, or tooth loss. 
The present study is larger and longer than any study of 
calcium monotherapy yet published. As such, it is able to 
establish the beneﬁcial effects of calcium supplementation 
on bone density with greater certainty than has been possi- 
ble thus far. It also shows that calcium effects on bone 
turnover are sustained over time. Although contributing 
these important ﬁndings, the study did not resolve the crit- 
ical question of whether calcium is able to reduce fracture 
incidence. It is probably only through meta-analysis that 
this question will be addressed, and the present study makes 
an important contribution to the quantity of data available 
for such future analyses. In the meantime, the role of cal- 
cium in fracture prevention remains uncertain.

out suggestions from the very limited data available to date 
that total fracture numbers might be reduced by as much as 
50%.7 However, the 10% to 20% reduction in total fracture 
rate suggested by this study would be of value in the large 
osteopenic population that sustains the majority of post- 
menopausal fractures.14 The present data provide a substan- 
tial increase in the quantity of fracture data available for
