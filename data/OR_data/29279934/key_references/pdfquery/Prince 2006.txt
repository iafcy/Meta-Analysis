Effects of Calcium Supplementation 
on Clinical Fracture and Bone Structure 


Background: Increased dietary calcium intake has been 
proposed as a population-based public health interven- 
tion to prevent osteoporotic fractures. We have exam- 
ined whether calcium supplementation decreases clini- 
cal fracture risk in elderly women and its mechanism of 
action. 
Methods: Five-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study of 1460 women recruited from the population and 
older than 70 years (mean age, 75 years) who were ran- 
domized to receive calcium carbonate, 600 mg twice per 
day, or identical placebo. The primary end points in- 
cluded clinical incident osteoporotic fractures, verte- 
bral deformity, and adverse events ascertained in 5 years. 
Bone structure was also measured using dual x-ray ab- 
sorptiometry of the hip and whole body, quantitative ul- 
trasonography of the heel, and peripheral quantitative 
computed tomography of the distal radius. 
analysis, calcium supplementation did not significantly re- 
duce fracture risk (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence in- 
terval, 0.67-1.12). However, 830 patients (56.8%) who took 
80% or more of their tablets (calcium or placebo) per year 
had reduced fracture incidence in the calcium compared 
with the placebo groups (10.2% vs 15.4%; hazard ratio, 
0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97). Calcium- 
treated patients had improved quantitative ultrasonogra- 
phy findings of the heel, femoral neck and whole-body dual 
x-ray absorptiometry data, and bone strength compared 
with placebo-treated patients. Of the 92 000 adverse events 
recorded, constipation was the only event increased by the 
treatment (calcium group, 13.4%; placebo group, 9.1%). 
Conclusion: Supplementation with calcium carbonate tab- 
lets supplying 1200 mg/d is ineffective as a public health in- 
tervention in preventing clinical fractures in the ambulatory 
elderly population owing to poor long-term compliance, 
but it is effective in those patients who are compliant. 
Results: Among our patients, 16.1% sustained 1 or more 
clinical osteoporotic fractures. In the intention-to-treat 


trogen is increased cal- 
and cell studies have con- 
firmed that an important 
physiological effect of es- 
cium transport across the bowel wall and 
kidney tubule.1,2 Thus, the reduction in cir- 
culating estrogen concentration after 
menopause results in a small daily nega- 
tive calcium balance.3 This negative cal- 
cium balance can be partly corrected by 
increasing dietary calcium intake as dem- 
onstrated by the beneficial effects of cal- 
cium supplementation on bone density in 
postmenopausal women.3-7 The unre- 
solved critical issue for patient care is 
whether the effect size is sufficient to re- 
duce clinical fracture rates. 
Reducing the population risk of frac- 
ture is likely to require a public health in- 
tervention for all in addition to treatment 
of high-risk individuals with pharmaceu- 
tical intervention.8 Therefore, the cur- 
rent study was planned as a study of cal- 
cium supplementation in a relatively 
healthy, vitamin D–sufficient, and ambu- 
latory elderly population in which the 
whole population rather than those with 
low bone mass were studied. The study 
also examines the biochemical and struc- 
tural effects of calcium supplementation 
to provide an understanding of the mecha- 
nism of the effect on fracture reduction. 


We recruited 1460 women during 1 year using 
a population-based approach in which a ran- 
dom selection of women (n=24 800) older than 
70 years on the electoral roll in Western Aus- 
tralia received a letter inviting them to join the 
study. Of these, 4312 individuals responded and 
were contacted by telephone (Figure 1). More 
than 98% of women of this age are on the elec- 
toral roll (n=33 366). Although the patients en- 
tering the study were weighted in favor of those 
in higher socioeconomic categories, disease bur-

den and pharmaceutical consumption were similar to data ob- 
tained from whole populations of this age.9 Informed consent 
was obtained, and the Human Rights Committee of the Univer- 
sity of Western Australia, Perth, Australia, approved the study. 

A prevalent fracture was recorded if it occurred after the age of 
50 years, was due to minimal trauma as defined by falling from 
a height of less than 1 m, and was not of the face, skull, or pha- 
langes (Table 1). The number of years since menopause was 
calculated for each patient using reported age at last men- 
strual period, hysterectomy and ovariectomy, or onset of hot 
flushes. A positive smoking history was reported if at least 1 
cigarette per day had been smoked for 3 months or longer at 
any time. Daily intake of protein, calcium, and alcohol was de- 
termined from a self-administered semiquantitative food fre- 
quency questionnaire.10,11 

Grip strength of the dominant hand was recorded as the highest 
of 3 attempts12 using a handheld dynamometer (Hand Grip Dy- 
namometer; TEC, Clifton, NJ). Body mass index was calculated 
as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. 
Activity levels were calculated in kilocalories per day using 
a validated method13 that combines body weight, answers to 
questions on the number of hours and type of physical activ- 
ity, and energy costs of such activities,14,15 with a response of 
no to the activity questions resulting in a 0 score. 
Mobility functioning was measured by the timed Up & Go 
test, which required that patients be timed while getting up, 
walking 3 m, turning, returning to the chair, and sitting down 
again.16 Results of the standing Rhomberg Balance Test17 were 
classified as to whether the patient was able to maintain a tan- 
dem stance for at least 10 seconds. 

Calcaneal quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) measurements 
of the left foot were obtained using an ultrasound densitom- 
eter (Lunar Achilles; GE Lunar Corp, Madison, Wis) at base- 
line and 5 years; the coefficients of variation (CV) for speed of 
sound and broadband ultrasound attenuation were 0.43% and 
1.59%, respectively. Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) bone den- 
sity was measured at the hip and whole body on a fan-beam 
densitometer (Hologic Acclaim 4500A; Hologic Corp, Waltham, 
Mass) at 1 and 5 years. The CVs at the total hip, femoral neck, 
and whole body were 1.2%, 1.4%, and 0.8%, respectively.18 Pe- 
ripheral quantitative computed tomography bone structure and 
density were measured in the radius at a site 4% of the length 
of the radius distal to the wrist joint, using a peripheral quan- 
titative computed tomography device (XCT-2000; StraTec 
Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). The voxel size 
was set at 150 µm in the x and y directions and 1000 µm in the 
z direction. The CVs for trabecular and cortical bone mineral 
density were 4.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The cross-sectional 
area of cortical bone was measured using a threshold of peri- 
osteal and endosteal bone density of 710 and 169 mg/cm3, re- 
spectively. The Stress Strain Index was calculated as the prod- 
uct of the section modulus and cortical density normalized to 
the maximal physiological cortical density of human bones (1200 
mg/cm3) for the polar moment and the bending moments in 
the x and y directions, where the y direction is the widest part 
of the radius and the x direction is perpendicular to this.19 

Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level was measured 
using an immunochemiluminometric method with intra- 
assay and interassay CVs of 3.6% and 6.2%, respectively.20 Total 
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level was measured using an ex- 
traction technique, followed by a competitive binding assay us- 
ing diluted human serum that measures 25-hydroxycholecal- 
ciferol and ergocalciferol levels equally. Intra-assay and interassay 
CVs were 8% and 16%, respectively.21 
RANDOMIZATION TO STUDY TREATMENT 
AND COMPLIANCE 
Patients received calcium carbonate tablets, 600 mg twice per 
day (with morning and evening meals), or identical placebo tab- 
lets (Wyeth Consumer Healthcare, Baulkham Hills, Australia). 
The randomization list was produced by generating 150 blocks 
of 10 numbers. In each block, 5 positions representing placebo 
and 5 positions representing calcium treatment were ordered us- 
ing a letter code according to a random number generator. The 
numbered blocks were ordered according to randomly gener- 
ated numbers, and an identification number was assigned in or- 
der to each letter code in the randomized list. The Pharmacy De- 
partment of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Australia, 
assigned a treatment to the letter code and assigned the appro- 
priate medications to the patient according to this list. The ran- 
domization was stratified by allocating patients to blocks ac- 
cording to whether a prevalent nontraumatic fracture had 
occurred after age 50 years, ensuring that an equal number of 
patients with and without a prevalent fracture received placebo 
or calcium. Medication compliance was checked by counting re- 
turned tablets at each 12-month review and was calculated as a 
percentage of the optimum. Average yearly compliance of less 
than 80% was classified as noncompliant. 

Adverse events resulting in attendance to a health care profes- 
sional were recorded in a diary at 4-month intervals and coded 
using the International Classification of Primary Care, Ver- 
sion 2-Plus, system database of disease coding (Family Medi- 
cine Research Unit, Department of General Practice, Univer- 
sity of Sydney, Sydney, Australia). Adverse events were grouped 
according to 17 categories identified by the International Clas- 
sification of Primary Care, Version 2-Plus, system.22 Atrau-

matic incident clinical fractures and atraumatic symptomatic 
vertebral fractures were reported in the diary. The diagnosis 
and classification of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures were 
confirmed by radiographic reports. 
Vertebral deformities were assessed using morphometric 
x-ray absorptiometry software on a densitometer (software ver- 
sion 9.1, Hologic 4500A; Hologic Corp) at years 1 and 5. The 
positions of 6 reference markers for each vertebra were placed 
at the corners and in the middle of the upper and lower surface 
of each vertebra. The mean CVs in morphometric x-ray absorp- 
tiometry measurements of the anterior, middle, and posterior 
heights of vertebrae varied from 5.8% at T6 to 3.1% at L4. Ver- 
tebral heights reference data and values for deformities were cal- 
culated according to a modification of the procedure described 
by McCloskey et al.23 Incident vertebral deformities were de- 
fined as vertebral deformities not present at year 1, with a re- 
duction in posterior, middle, or anterior heights of 20% or more. 
clinical event was analyzed using the Cox proportional haz- 
ards model with and without adjustment for covariates. Dif- 
ferences between normally distributed characteristics of the treat- 
ment groups were determined by univariate analysis of variance 
with adjustments for covariates. The Mann-Whitney test was 
used to determine the differences between the groups for non- 
normally distributed variables. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, 
and P(cid:1).05 was considered significant. 
Power calculations were conducted before study commence- 
ment, assuming a fracture rate of 3.5% per year in the placebo 
group and assuming that calcium would reduce the event rate 
by 35%. At a power of at least 80%, at an (cid:2) of .05, and allowing 
for a 30% noncompliance rate during the 5-year study, recruit- 
ment of 737 patients per group was required.

dows version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc, Chicago, Ill). The time to first

made it unlikely they would survive the 5 years of the study, 
44 (3.6%) were participating in another clinical trial, and 
2 (0.2%) were not prepared to be assigned to the placebo. 
Another 1580 individuals were not interested. Therefore, 
1510 women were eligible for the study, of whom the first 
1460 were recruited. There were no differences in base- 
line demographic characteristics between the placebo and 
calcium groups. In a randomly selected subset of patients 
(n=81), 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were generally above 
the deficient range because only 6.1% (during winter) and 
2.8% (during summer) of patients had vitamin D concen- 
trations below 12 ng/mL ((cid:1)30 nmol/L) (mean±SD win- 
ter level, 27±14 ng/mL [67±35 nmol/L]; mean±SD sum- 
mer level, 35 ± 12 ng/mL [87 ± 30 nmol/L]). No PTH 
concentrations were above the upper limit of the refer- 
ence range (mean ± SD winter level, 37 ± 11 pg/mL; 
mean±SD summer level, 37±11 pg/mL; n=81). 
The risks of withdrawal and death were the same in 
the calcium group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confi- 
dence interval [CI], 0.63 -1.16) compared with the pla- 
cebo group (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.47-1.23) (Figure 1). 
Eight hundred thirty patients (56.8%) complied with the 
medication regimen throughout the study, with no sig- 
nificant difference in compliance failure in the calcium 
group (310 patients) compared with the placebo group 
(320 patients) ((cid:3)2=0.28; P=.60). Compared with com- 
pliant patients, noncompliant persons were slightly older, 
weaker, and slower and had lower QUS measures 
(Table 1), but there were no differences related to the 
original randomization to calcium or placebo. 

Table 2 and Figure 2 show the fracture outcomes. A 
total of 236 individuals (16.2%) sustained 297 incident 
osteoporotic fractures. The intention-to-treat analysis did 
not demonstrate an effect of calcium to reduce fracture risk, 
recorded as time to first fracture at any site (HR, 0.87; 95% 
CI, 0.67-1.12), time to first fracture of the appendicular 
skeleton (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.65-1.18), time to first ver- 
tebral fracture (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.63-1.54), or incident 
morphometric x-ray absorptiometry vertebral deformity. 
A preplanned per protocol analysis restricted to the 
830 patients (56.8%) who consumed 80% of tablets 
(Figure 2 and Table 2) demonstrated a reduction in all- 
site clinical fractures (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97), ap- 
pendicular fractures (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.43-0.97), and 
upper limb fractures (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92) in 
the calcium group before and after adjustment for age, 
body mass index, and prevalent baseline fracture en- 
tered as covariates. Baseline dietary calcium intake did 
not influence any of the HRs obtained. Although analy- 
sis of the baseline structural assessment of the skeleton 
using heel QUS (broadband ultrasound attenuation or 
speed of sound) adjusted for treatment status showed that 
individuals with higher measurements had reduced in- 
cident fracture risk (HR per 1-SD increase in speed of 
sound, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.58-0.77; HR per 1-SD increase 
in broadband ultrasound attenuation, 0.70; 95% CI 0.61- 
0.80), the addition of baseline QUS bone structural mea- 
sures did not substantially alter any of the fracture HRs 
examined. 
An analysis of fractures in the noncompliant popula- 
tion showed no difference in the number or type of frac- 
tures sustained between placebo- and calcium-treated 
patients. 

There was no difference in any bone factors between cal- 
cium- and placebo-treated patients at baseline (QUS) and 
1 year (DXA) (Table 1). The changes in bone structure 
are shown in Figure 3. The QUS measurements from 
baseline to 5 years, adjusted for body mass index, age, 
and tablet compliance, show significant improvement in 
calcium-treated patients for broadband ultrasound at- 
tenuation and stiffness, but not speed of sound. A reduc- 
tion in the loss of bone content and area but not bone 
mineral density was seen at the femoral neck and whole-

maintenance of or improvement in QUS and DXA mea- 
sures with calcium supplementation supports an effect to 
improve bone mass and possibly architecture. The periph- 
eral quantitative computed tomography data showed that 
the effect of calcium was principally to maintain cortical 
bone in the endocortical area. At the radial site, it was pos- 
sible to demonstrate an increase in cortical volume and 
therefore mass and calculated resistance to torsional and 
bending forces by calcium, an expected result of in- 
creased cortical bone mass. The lack of effect on trabec- 
ular bone density was surprising but may relate to a sub- 
stantially damaged trabecular structure in these individuals 
or a site-specific effect of reduced bone resorption via ef- 
fects on reducing the PTH level.5 This was supported by 
body sites but not other hip sites, in the calcium-treated 
patients before and after adjustment for body mass in- 
dex, age, and tablet compliance during the study. The 
cross-sectional radius peripheral quantitative com- 
puted tomography data measured at 5 years show a larger 
cortical volume in the calcium group compared with the 
placebo group, which had a favorable effect on the bone 
strength factors of the polar Stress Strain Index and Stress 
Strain Index in the x and y directions. 
The PTH level decreased from baseline to year 5 (107 
placebo- and 103 calcium-treated patients) in the calcium 
compared with the placebo group (mean ± SD change, 
−8.9±13.2 and −2.0±13.2 pg/mL, respectively; P(cid:1).001). 

Of the 92 000 adverse events recorded, only constipa- 
tion was higher in the calcium group (13.4%) compared 
with the placebo group (9.1%), with no difference be- 
tween groups in the percentage of patients who stopped 
study medication therapy because of constipation. Two 
patients in each treatment group had kidney stones dur- 
ing the study. Incident ischemic heart disease was diag- 
nosed in 56 patients (7.7%) in the calcium group and in 
51 patients (7.0%) in the placebo group, with no differ- 
ence in the relative risk for the calcium compared with 
placebo group (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.77-1.64). 

The patients recruited for the study were representative of 
non–vitamin D–deficient ambulatory women older than 70 
years who have a 5-year risk of fracture greater than 15%. 
The principal finding was that randomization to a cal- 
cium supplement for 5 years failed to show a significant 
preventive effect on fracture, with results similar to those 
of a previous meta-analysis24 of a number of small studies 
of appendicular fracture (relative risk, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67- 
1.12) and a recently reported study25 of patients with a pre- 
vious fracture (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81-1.09). They are di- 
vergent from previous reports26,27 of beneficial effects of 
combined calcium and cholecalciferol (vitamin D) treat- 
ment in patients who may have been vitamin D deficient 
and studies28,29 showing a reduction in spine fracture with 
calcium supplementation in osteoporotic patients. 
The lack of significance of calcium therapy in the in- 
tention-to-treat analysis is likely due to the lack of com- 
pliance with the medication regimen, which in the power 
calculation before commencement of the study was pre- 
dicted to be 30%, but was in fact 43%. This is a limitation 
of the study but reflects the difficulties of implementa- 
tion of preventive health practice in all such studies. An- 
other possible cause for this relative lack of efficacy may 
be that the vitamin D status of the population, although 
substantially better than that encountered in studies in 
higher latitudes, may have been insufficient to allow op- 
timal absorption and disposal of calcium to the skeleton. 
In the per-protocol analysis of the 56.8% of patients who 
took 80% or more of their assigned medication, the risk 
of any clinical osteoporotic fracture was reduced by a fac- 
tor of 0.34 (absolute risk reduction, 15.4%-10.2%). The

In patients compliant with the medication regimen, base- 
line dietary calcium intake, baseline heel QUS, or 1-year 
hip DXA were not significant covariates in the fracture 
analysis. Thus, the effect of 1.2 g of calcium appears to be 
sufficiently large to be applicable to compliant individu- 
als, irrespective of dietary calcium intake, with no signifi-

cant modifying effect of baseline bone structure. To date, 
studies of the effectiveness of pharmacologic agents other 
than hormone replacement therapy30 in reducing frac- 
ture rates has been restricted to high-risk populations with 
low DXA bone mineral density.31 When patients have not 
been selected on the basis of low DXA bone mass density, 
no hip fracture reduction has been found.32 
The per-protocol analysis potentially violated the origi- 
nalrandomization.Comparedwithcompliant patients, non- 
compliantindividualswereslightlyolder,weaker,andslower 
and had lower QUS measures, but these effects did not op- 
erate differentially in the 2 treatment groups. We also evalu- 
ated differences between treatment groups in fracture in the 
noncompliant patients in addition to the compliant patients. 
The analysis of fracture rates in the noncompliant patients 
showed no difference in risk of fracture related to treatment 
group, thus making it unlikely that patients had become 
noncompliant owing to treatment status. 
Because it is important for a public health interven- 
tion to be safe, we conducted a careful evaluation of ad- 
verse events. Our evaluation showed that, although con- 
stipation increased with calcium treatment, the risk of 
kidney stones, ischemic heart disease, or other adverse 
events was not increased. 
In conclusion, the calcium supplementation regimen 
tested currently cannot be recommended as a public health 
approach to fracture prevention because of the lack of 
long-term compliance. These data should give pause to 
those who consider that public health policy in this area 
should be based on epidemiological or surrogate end- 
point data. However, these data support the continued 
use of calcium supplements by women who are able to 
remain compliant with their use. In these individuals, es- 
pecially if they are under the care of a clinician, calcium 
supplementation is a safe and effective therapy for re- 
ducing the risk of osteoporotic fracture.
