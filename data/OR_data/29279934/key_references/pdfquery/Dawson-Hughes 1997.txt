Background 
Inadequate dietary intake of calcium 
and vitamin D may contribute to the high prevalence 
of osteoporosis among older persons. 


We studied the effects of three years of 
dietary supplementation with calcium and vitamin D 
on bone mineral density, biochemical measures of 
bone metabolism, and the incidence of nonvertebral 
fractures in 176 men and 213 women 65 years of age 
or older who were living at home. They received either 
500 mg of calcium plus 700 IU of vitamin D 
 (chole- 
3 
calciferol) per day or placebo. Bone mineral density 
was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, 
blood and urine were analyzed every six months, 
and cases of nonvertebral fracture were ascertained 
by means of interviews and verified with use of hos- 
pital records.

fractures, 26 were in the placebo group and 11 were

Conclusions 
In men and women 65 years of age 
or older who are living in the community, dietary 
supplementation with calcium and vitamin D moder- 
ately reduced bone loss measured in the femoral 
neck, spine, and total body over the three-year study 
period and reduced the incidence of nonvertebral 
fractures. (N Engl J Med 1997;337:670-6.)

NADEQUATE intake of calcium and vitamin D 
leads to reduced calcium absorption, increased 
serum parathyroid hormone concentrations, 
and bone loss. Low bone mass is a strong pre- 
dictor of fracture. 
 Supplemental calcium reduces 
1 
bone loss in middle-aged, postmenopausal women 
2-8 
and lowers rates of vertebral fracture in women with 
previous vertebral fractures. 
 Supplementation with 
9 
vitamin D alone reduced bone loss from the femoral 
 but it did not 
neck in postmenopausal women, 
reduce the rate of hip fracture among elderly Dutch 
men and women. 
 Annual intramuscular injections 





of vitamin D did, however, reduce rates of arm frac- 
ture among elderly Finnish subjects. 

 



There is a rationale for supplementing the diets of 
elderly subjects with a combination of calcium and 
 and possibly of 
vitamin D. Absorption of calcium 
vitamin D 
 by the 
16 
skin decline with aging. Diets that are deficient in 
calcium tend also to be deficient in vitamin D because 
a single food, milk, is the principal dietary source of 
both these nutrients. Combined calcium and vitamin 
D supplementation has reduced rates of nonvertebral 
fracture among elderly women living in retirement 
homes. 
 In the one available study of men (mean 
age, 58 years) who lived at home, calcium and vita-

of combined supplements in elderly men and wom- 
en living at home is unknown. We examined the ef- 
fects of combined calcium and vitamin D supple- 
mentation on bone loss, biochemical measures of 
bone metabolism, and the incidence of nonvertebral 
fractures in men and women 65 years of age or older 
who were living in the community. 




We studied only healthy, ambulatory men and women 65 years 
of age or older who were recruited through direct mailings and 
presentations in the community. The criteria for exclusion includ- 
ed current cancer or hyperparathyroidism; a kidney stone in the 
past five years; renal disease; bilateral hip surgery; therapy with a 
bisphosphonate, calcitonin, estrogen, tamoxifen, or testosterone in 
the past six months or fluoride in the past two years; femoral-neck 
bone mineral density more than 2 SD below the mean for subjects 
of the same age and sex; dietary calcium intake exceeding 1500 
mg per day; and laboratory evidence of kidney or liver disease. 
We prescreened 848 subjects by means of a questionnaire and 
invited 545 for screening. Of these, 51 were found to be ineligi- 
ble, 49 were potentially eligible but were not enrolled, and 445 
(199 men and 246 women) were enrolled. There were 430 
whites, 11 blacks, and 4 Asians. The protocol was approved by the 
Human Investigation Review Committee at Tufts University, and 
written informed consent was obtained from each subject. 

In this three-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the 
subjects were randomly assigned to either the placebo or the cal- 
cium–vitamin D group with stratification according to sex, race, 
and decade of age. At study entry, we performed physical exami- 
nations and assessed the subjects’ medical history, diet, and phys-

ical-activity level; analyzed blood and urine; and measured bone 
mineral density. The subjects were advised to maintain their usual 
diets and to avoid taking supplemental calcium and vitamin D on 
their own for two months before and throughout the study. At 
bedtime, the subjects took separate pills containing 500 mg of el- 
 and 700 
emental calcium in the form of calcium citrate malate 
IU of cholecalciferol or separate placebo tablets containing mi- 
crocrystalline cellulose. 

Calcium citrate malate (Procter & Gamble, Cincinnati) was 
prepared in two batches; assays confirmed that the contents were 
as expected. The vitamin D tablets used initially contained 707 
IU; two years later, the tablets were found to contain 563 IU (80 
percent) of the planned dose of 700 IU; a second lot initially con- 
taining 768 IU was used during the second half of the study. The 
tablets were stored in opaque bottles at room temperature. 

During the trial, 127 subjects discontinued treatment; 4 died, 
40 stopped for personal reasons (e.g., they lost interest or moved 
away), 46 withdrew because of illness, 17 started estrogen or glu- 
cocorticoid therapy, and 20 withdrew because of problems with 
the medication. The majority of subjects who discontinued treat- 
ment did so in the first year. These subjects were encouraged to 
return for all subsequent follow-up evaluations. At the last visit, 
389 subjects (87 percent of the 445 enrolled) were evaluated and 
were included in the main intention-to-treat analyses. The 318 
subjects who remained in the two study groups (i.e., those who 
took the supplements throughout the study period) were includ- 
ed in the analyses of subjects who completed the study according 
to the protocol. 
(cid:2) 
The mean ( 
SD) rate of compliance with treatment, assessed 
on the basis of pill counts, was 92 
placebo tablets and 93 
tablets among the 318 subjects who completed the study.

The subjects came to the center every six months for measure- 
ments of bone mineral density, biochemical assays, and other 
measurements. Their calcium and vitamin D intake was estimated 
on the basis of a food-frequency questionnaire. 
 During the 
study, 44 of the subjects who completed the study treatment (23 
in the placebo group and 21 in the calcium–vitamin D group) re- 
ported taking products that contained some calcium or vitamin D. 
They were asked to stop taking these products, and the intake from 
supplements was added to their dietary intake during the relevant 
period. Leisure, household, and occupational activity was estimat- 
ed with use of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly question- 
naire. 
 Tobacco use was determined by questionnaire. Height was 
measured with a stadiometer, and weight with a digital scale. 


The subjects were asked to send in a postcard after any fall. When 
such a postcard was received, a staff member called the subject to 
verify the circumstances. Subjects reported any additional falls at 
each follow-up visit. Nonvertebral fractures were identified during 
interviews at the same visits. The principal investigator, who was 
unaware of the subjects’ study-group assignments, classified the 
fractures as nonosteoporotic (resulting from severe trauma) or os- 
teoporotic (resulting from moderate-to-minor trauma — i.e., a fall 
from standing height or less). All but one nonvertebral fracture 
(a presumed toe fracture that was not treated) were verified by 
review of x-ray reports or hospital records. 

Bone mineral density in the hip, spine, and total body was meas- 
ured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry with use of a DPX-L 
scanner (Lunar Radiation, Madison, Wis.). Scanner software ver- 
sions 1.2 and 1.3y were used for data acquisition and analysis, re- 
spectively. The coefficients of variation for the measurements were 
2.0 percent (femoral neck), 1.0 percent (spine), and 0.6 percent 
(total body). The scans of the hip were performed in duplicate, 
with repositioning between scans, and the values were averaged. A 
phantom consisting of bone ash embedded in a 12-cm block was 
scanned every other week as a control; the bone mineral density 
of the phantom was stable throughout the study. 


Blood was drawn between 7:00 and 9:30 a.m. after the subjects 
had fasted for at least eight hours. Urine measurements were made 
in 24-hour collections. Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D was meas- 
ured by the method of Preece et al., 
 plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvita- 
min D by a competitive protein-binding method, 
 serum parathy- 
roid hormone by immunometric assay (Nichols Institute, San Juan 
Capistrano, Calif.), serum osteocalcin by immunoradiometric as- 
-telopeptide cross-links by en- 
N 
say (Nichols Institute), urinary 
zyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Ostex International, Seattle), 
and serum ionized calcium and urinary calcium and creatinine as 
reported previously. 
 The coefficients of variation for these assays 
ranged from 5.6 percent to 7.7 percent. Analyses were performed 
as the samples were collected, except for the plasma 1,25-dihy- 
droxyvitamin D and urinary 
-telopeptide assays, for which initial 
and final samples were analyzed at the same time. 



Comparisons between the study groups were made with two- 
sample t-tests and, when adjustments were required, with analysis 
of covariance. Terms for the interaction of sex and study group in 
analysis-of-variance models of the change in bone mineral density 
were statistically significant only at the femoral neck in the sub- 
jects in the intention-to-treat analysis; this term did not remain 
significant after adjustment for the duration of treatment. The 
relative risks of fracture among the subjects in the calcium–vita- 
min D and placebo groups were compared by means of the chi- 
square test. Analyses were conducted with SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chi- 
cago) and SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.) software. All P values 
are two-sided. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted accord- 
; selected secondary 
ing to the principles described by Newell 
analyses were restricted to subjects who completed the study. 


The base-line characteristics of the 389 subjects 
are shown in Table 1. As compared with placebo, 
supplementation with calcium and vitamin D had a 
significant positive effect on the change over three 
years in bone mineral density measured at the fem- 
oral neck, spine, and total body in all subjects to- 
gether and in the men (Table 2). The women in the 
calcium–vitamin D group had significantly less total- 
body bone loss than those in the placebo group; the 
differences in the changes at the femoral neck and 
spine were smaller and not statistically significant. 
Adjustment for differences between the study groups 
in base-line bone mineral density and calcium intake 
did not alter the results. 
The time course of the response to treatment was 
examined in the 318 subjects who completed the 
study. Their clinical characteristics and bone mineral 
density at base line did not differ significantly from 
those of subjects who discontinued the study treat- 
ment, except that smoking was more prevalent in the 
latter group (10 percent, as compared with 4 percent 
among those who completed the study; P 
0.02). 
During the first year there was significantly less bone 
loss at the hip, spine, and total body in the calcium– 
vitamin D group; during the second and third years, 
however, there was significantly less loss only in the 
total body (Table 3).

in the placebo group, had osteoporotic fractures, and 
the best predictor of osteoporotic fracture was female 
sex (P(cid:6)0.001). Among the 318 subjects who com- 
pleted the study, the relative risk of any first nonver- 
tebral fracture in the calcium–vitamin D group as 
compared with the placebo group was 0.4 (95 per- 
cent confidence interval, 0.2 to 1.0; P(cid:5)0.03), and 
that for fractures classified as osteoporotic was 0.4 
(95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 1.1; P(cid:5)0.06). 
There was no significant difference between the treat- 
ment groups in the percentage of subjects who fell; 
among women, the number of falls per subject who 
fell was somewhat higher in the calcium–vitamin D 
group than in the placebo group (data not shown). 
Two women (one in each study group) had a second 
osteoporotic fracture during the study. 
The supplements were generally well tolerated, but 
11 subjects discontinued treatment because of diffi- 
culty swallowing the pills and 9 discontinued because 
of other side effects (in the placebo group: 2 because 
of epigastric distress and 1 because of flank pain; in 
the calcium–vitamin D group: 3 because of constipa- 
tion, 1 because of epigastric distress, 1 because of 
sweating, and 1 because of hypercalciuria). 

In this study, dietary supplementation with calci- 
um and vitamin D reduced bone loss moderately in 
men and women 65 years of age or older who were 
living in the community. Among the men, there was 
a significant effect of treatment at the hip, spine, and 
total body. In an earlier study by Orwoll et al., a 
similar regimen of calcium and vitamin D had no ef- 
fect, perhaps because the men in that study were 
younger and had a higher mean calcium intake than 
the men we studied (1160 vs. about 700 mg per 
day).18 The reduction in total-body bone loss in 
women in this study was similar to that in other tri- 
als of calcium supplementation alone.3,4 The esti- 
mated differences in bone mineral density at the 
femoral neck and spine among the women in the 
two study groups were similar to those found in oth- 
er studies,2-4,6,10,11,25 although the differences did not 
reach statistical significance in our study. The effect 
of supplementation in all subjects was similar to that 
in the subjects who completed the study, as would 
be expected, given the high degree of overlap be- 
tween the two groups. Treatment caused few symp- 
toms or side effects. 
In both men and women, calcium–vitamin D sup- 
plementation reduced total-body bone loss not only 
in the first year (an effect that could be ascribed to 
the closure of bone-remodeling space26), but also in 
the second and third years, suggesting long-term ef- 
fectiveness of supplementation in terms of the skele- 
ton as a whole. The initial effects of supplementation 
at the hip and spine during year 1 were maintained 
but not increased during the ensuing two years of the

Figure 1. Cumulative Percentage of All 389 Subjects with a First 
Nonvertebral Fracture, According to Study Group. 
By 36 months, 26 of 202 subjects in the placebo group and 11

study. Others have reported a cumulative benefit in 
terms of total-body3,4 and femoral-neck3 bone density 
with the use of higher doses of calcium in younger 
postmenopausal women. Spinal bone mineral density 
increased in both study groups, probably because of 
increases in osteoarthritis and aortic calcification.27,28 
After three years of calcium–vitamin D supple- 
mentation, serum osteocalcin concentrations were 
9 percent lower in the men and 14 percent lower in 
the women than at base line, indicating that supple- 
mentation led to a sustained reduction in the rate of 
bone remodeling. The lack of change in urinary 
N-telopeptide excretion may reflect the variability of 
this measurement. Our study confirms previous ob- 
servations that the rate of bone turnover, as meas- 
ured by urinary excretion of pyridinoline cross-links29 
and serum osteocalcin concentrations,30 is lower in 
men than in women. 
The reduction in the incidence of nonvertebral 
fractures in the calcium–vitamin D group should be 
interpreted with some caution, because of the small 
number of study subjects. Nonetheless, the magni- 
tude of the reduction in the risk of fracture was sim- 
ilar to that reported in a study of more than 3400 
elderly French women treated with 1200 mg of cal- 
cium plus 800 IU of vitamin D or placebo each 
day.17 In a study of 2600 elderly Dutch men and 
women, there was no reduction in the incidence of 
fractures among those given 400 IU of vitamin D 
daily (without calcium), as compared with those giv- 
en placebo.12 Our results differ from those of the 
Dutch study, possibly by chance (we studied fewer 
subjects) or because the treatments differed. When 
comparing the three-year rates of nonvertebral frac- 
tures among women assigned to placebo in several re- 
cent trials, we found that the 19.6 percent rate in this 
study was intermediate between the 9 percent report- 
ed for women who were, on average, 7 years younger 
than our subjects31 and the 27 percent reported for 
women who were 13 years older.17 We do not know 
the individual contributions of calcium or vitamin D 
to the results in our study. 
The limited effect of calcium and vitamin D on 
bone mineral density, which was evident primarily in 
year 1, seems unlikely to account for the constant de- 
cline in the rate of nonvertebral fractures during the 
three-year study. A treatment-induced reduction in 
the incidence of falls does not appear to account for 
the reduction in the rate of fractures, since the num- 
ber of falls was similar in the two groups. The reduc- 
tion in the rate of bone turnover may have influenced 
the fracture rate by reducing the potential for trabec- 
ular perforation and reducing cortical porosity. 
In conclusion, calcium and vitamin D supplemen- 
tation leads to a moderate reduction in bone loss 
and may substantially reduce the risk of nonvertebral 
fractures among men and women 65 years of age or 
older who live in the community.
