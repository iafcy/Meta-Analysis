ABSTRACT 
Antifracture efficacy of high-dose vitamin D (800 IU) and calcium (1000 mg) remains controversial. To determine whether daily 800 IU of 
vitamin D and 1000 mg of calcium supplementation prevents fractures, we randomized 3432 women of the population-based 
Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) Study cohort (ages 65 to 71 years) living in the region of northern Savonia, Finland 
(latitude 628 to 648N) for 3 years to receive 800 IU of cholecalciferol and 1000 mg of calcium as calcium carbonate or to a control group 
that did not receive placebo. The main outcome measure was incident fractures. Fracture data were collected in telephone interviews 
and validated. Data on 3195 women, 1586 in the intervention group and 1609 in the control group, were available for analysis. In 
adjusted Cox proportional hazards models, the risk of any fracture decreased in the vitamin D and calcium group by 17% [adjusted 
hazard ratio (aHR) ¼ 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–1.12], and the risk of any nonvertebral fracture decreased by 13% 
(aHR ¼ 0.87; 95% CI 0.63–1.19). The risk of distal forearm fractures decreased by 30% (aHR ¼ 0.70; 95% CI 0.41–1.20), and the risk of 
any upper extremity fractures decreased by 25% (aHR ¼ 0.75; 95% CI 0.49–1.16), whereas the risk of lower extremity fractures remained 
essentially equal (aHR ¼ 1.02; 95% CI 0.58–1.80). None of these effects reached statistical significance. In conclusion, this study did not 
produce statistically significant evidence that vitamin D and calcium supplementation prevents fractures in a 65- to 71-year-old general 
population of postmenopausal women. (cid:1) 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. 



fractures constitute a major health economic problem in 
elderly women. Vitamin D and calcium are recognized to play an 
important role in bone health. While calcium serves as one of the 
main constituents of bone matrix, vitamin D enhances calcium 
absorption. Further, vitamin D is also known to have an effect 
on muscle strength(1) and on postural and dynamic balance.(2) 
Deficiency of calcium or vitamin D regulates the production of 
parathyroid hormone (PTH).(3) High PTH levels activate bone 
turnover and degradation.(4,5) Normal levels of vitamin D and 
calcium protect the bone matrix by preventing secondary 
hyperparathyroidism.(4,6) Further, normalization of low vitamin D 
status helps to maintain normal muscle function and balance, 
decreasing the risks of falling and fracture.(7–10) 
In most cases, dietary sources of vitamin D are not sufficient, 
and people get most of their vitamin D from sunlight. People 
living in high latitudes have less exposure to sunlight and thus 
lower production of vitamin D.(11) The problem is particularly 
common in the elderly.(12,13) 
Postmenopausal osteoporosis constitutes the highest fracture 
risk in the elderly female population. Several strategies for fract- 
ure prevention in this population have been suggested, and the

fracture-preventing effect of vitamin D has been shown in some 
trials.(14–19) Results of other trials, however, have been conflict- 
ing.(20–27) Meta-analyses suggest that high doses of vitamin D 
((cid:2)600 IU) do prevent fractures and that this effect is stronger 
when combined with calcium.(8–10) However, many of the trials 
focused on high-risk subjects and have been conducted in 
institutionalized subjects. Moreover, many different exclusion 
criteria have been used. Therefore, when vitamin D and calcium 
supplementation is considered as a preventive strategy, general- 
izing the results of trials in the general elderly female population 
is compromised. To minimize the selection bias of the target 
population and to determine whether a prevention program in 
postmenopausal women would be useful, there is a need for a 
population-based randomized, controlled trial. 
Our hypothesis was that 800 IU of cholecalciferol and 1000 mg 
of calcium daily offered as a free supplementation would reduce 
fracture risk. The objective of this population-based randomized, 
controlled, open-label trial was to determine the efficacy of 
vitamin D and calcium supplementation as a population-level 
fracture-prevention strategy in 65- to 71-year-old women. 


The Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) Study 
was launched in 1989 in Kuopio, (eastern) Finland. A population- 
based sample of all women living in the region of northern 
Savonia, previous Kuopio Province (latitude 628 to 648N), born 
between 1932 and 1941 (n ¼ 14,220) was recruited to this obser- 
vational cohort study.(28) A baseline questionnaire in May 1989 
was returned by 13,100 women. The cohort received three postal 
follow-up questionnaires at 5 (1994), 10 (1999), and 15 years 
(2004). Subjects for the present OSTPRE Fracture Prevention 
Study (OSTPRE-FPS) were selected from the original cohort in 
November 2002. The inclusion criteria were age 65 years or older, 
still living in the region of northern Savonia, willing to participate, 
and had not participated in any trials or bone mineral density 
(BMD) measurements of the OSTPRE Study. There were no 
exclusion criteria. The new baseline postal questionnaire of 
OSTPRE-FPS with questions related to health and fracture risk 
was sent to 5407 women of the original sample. A total of 4706 
enquiries were returned, 3744 of which were adequately filled 
out, 3432 by women willing to participate and still living in the 
region of northern Savonia. These 3432 women were finally 
enrolled. The subjects were recruited from August to December 
2002, and the trial was conducted between February 2003 and 
June 2007. This study was carried out in the Bone and Cartilage 
Research Unit (BCRU) of the Clinical Research Centre of the 
University of Kuopio, Kuopio, Finland. The trial was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the study plan 
of OSTPRE-FPS was accepted by the Ethics Committee of the 
University Hospital of Kuopio. All subjects gave written informed 
consent. 

The primary aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of 
calcium and vitamin D supplementation in fracture prevention in 
65- to 71-year-old women as a population-level intervention. A 
secondary aim was to determine the effect of the intervention on 
serum vitamin D levels during follow-up. 

The 3432 enrolled subjects were randomized into intervention 
(n ¼ 1718) and control (n ¼ 1714) groups by an independent 
statistician based on simple randomization. Randomization was 
performed with SPSS for Windows 11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) 
statistical software without any blocking or stratification. 
OSTPRE-FPS was an open-label study. The intervention group 
received tablets containing 400 IU of cholecalciferol and 500 mg 
of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate twice daily (Calcichew 
D3 Forte, Leiras Nycomed, Ltd.). Subjects were advised to take 
the doses separately with meals. Participants in the control group 
did not receive any intervention or placebo. They were free to 
use supplements, but they were asked not to change their use of 
supplemented or dietary vitamin D or calcium. A subsample of 
750 women, 375 from both study groups, was randomly selected 
and invited to the BCRU for clinical testing. The subjects 
were informed by letter to which group they were randomized. 
The letter contained information concerning the trial and the 
prescription for the intervention. Subjects in the subsample 
visited the BCRU at the beginning of the follow-up and received 
their information and prescription there. Supplementation was 
distributed and recorded by the local pharmacies, free of charge. 
Distribution of the regimen was documented by the pharmacists, 
and compliance was calculated as the percentage of delivered 
tablets of the calculated consumption of 
follow-up period. 
Continuation or discontinuation of the supplementation with 
possible reasons (adverse effects or other reasons) was regi- 
stered in telephone interviews together with the primary out- 
come data (see below). 

The primary outcome measure was a fracture. Data on fractures 
were collected by telephone interviews once a year. In the sub- 
sample, telephone interviews were performed every 4 months. 
All self-reported fractures were validated using medical records 
or radiologic reports. Only fractures with radiologic confirmation 
were regarded as valid fractures, with the exception of rib 
fractures, for which a physician’s clinical diagnosis was regarded 
as valid. All fractures, regardless of the trauma energy, were 
included. Thoracic and lumbar vertebral fractures were analyzed 
as clinical vertebral 
fractures. Fractures other than cervical, 
thoracic, or lumbar vertebral fractures were defined and ana- 
lyzed as nonvertebral fractures. We also separately analyzed 
fractures distal from the glenohumeral joint as upper extremity 
fractures and those distal from the hip joint as lower extremity 
fractures. All clinical vertebral fractures and fractures of the 
distal forearm, proximal humerus, and hip were analyzed as 
osteoporotic fractures regardless of mechanism of injury. The 
secondary outcome measure was the effect of the intervention 
on the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] during the follow- 
up period in the subsample. 




Subjects in the subsample were invited to the BCRU at the 
beginning and end of the follow-up period. To avoid seasonal 
variations, nonfasting serum samples for 25(OH)D measurement 
were collected at baseline and at the end of the follow-up in the 
same month between February and May. Frozen serum samples 
were analyzed after trial closure by radioimmunoassay using a 
25(OH)D RIA kit from DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN, USA), with a 
coefficient of variation (CV) from 8.2% to 11.0%, according to the 
manufacturer. 
Subjects also underwent BMD measurements of the lumbar 
spine (L2 to L4) and left proximal femur with dual-energy X-ray- 
absorptiometry (DXA) using a Lunar Prodigy device (General 
Electric, Madison, WI, USA). Quality control determinations of the 
DXA instruments were run daily. The long-term reproducibility 
(CV) for the total femur region was 1.0%. The technical quality of 
each DXA measurement was checked carefully, and measure- 
ments with errors were not included in the statistical analyses. 

The baseline questionnaire contained questions about anth- 
ropometric measures (height in centimeters and weight in 
kilograms), age at menopause (years), use (no/yes) and duration 
(years) of hormone therapy (HT), gynecologic history, use of 
alcohol (doses per week), smoking (no/yes), physical ability, 
previous fractures (no/yes), parental fractures (no/yes), health 
disorders, and medications. Time (years) since menopause was 
calculated using the self-reported beginning of amenorrhea and 
the date of baseline. Total baseline calcium intake was calculated 
as milligrams per day from a 7-day food frequency questionnaire 
about milk products (120 mg/dL of other milk products, 87 mg/ 
slice of cheese(28)) and self-reported use of supplements. Secon- 
dary osteoporosis was considered present if subjects reported 
type 1 diabetes, hyperthyroidism, early menopause (age < 45 
years), chronic malnutrition (body mass index < 18.5), chronic 
malabsorption, or chronic liver disease.(29) 

Power calculations to determine sample size were carried out 
with the expected fracture rate of 30 per 1000 subjects per 
year(30) and an estimated 20% loss during follow-up. The ade- 
quate sample size to show a 30% reduction in fracture rate with 
90% power was calculated to be 1130 per group. 
The main analyses of these data were performed on a modified 
intention-to-treat 
(ITT) basis, where all subjects assigned to 
treatment were included. Subjects who did not provide any 
follow-up data on the primary endpoint variable could not be 
included in time-dependent Cox survival analysis. Thus these 237 
subjects (Fig. 1) were excluded from the analyses. All other subjects 
were analyzed according to the group allocation, including those 
lost to follow-up and those who discontinued the intervention. In 
the ITT analysis, 3195 subjects, 1586 from the intervention group 
and 1609 from the control group, were included. 
For baseline characteristics, group differences of continuous 
normally distributed variables were analyzed with the indepen- 
dent-samples t test and non–normally distributed variables with 
the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Class variables were 
tested with the Pearson chi-square test. The effect of interven- 
tion on fracture risk was calculated as hazard ratios (HRs) 
using the Cox proportional hazards model, where subjects were 
followed from the start of the trial until the end of follow-up, until 
their first incident fracture, or until their loss to follow-up. The 
effect size was calculated for different fracture types separately 
as a univariate model and adjusted for age, body mass index 
(BMI), smoking, use of alcohol, previous fracture, parental hip 
fracture, glucocorticoid use, and diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis 
and secondary osteoporosis, all well-known and well-validated 
confounders of fracture risk estimation.(29) Missing data on the 
continuous variable BMI (3.9%) were replaced by the mean; class 
variables smoking (10.9%) and use of alcohol (16.4%) with an 
extra category; and previous fracture (4.8%), parental hip fracture 
(1.8%), glucocorticoid use (6.7%), diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis 
(0.8%), and secondary osteoporosis (0.8%) were coded as neg- 
ative. The proportionality and linearity assumptions of hazards 
were explored with cumulative hazards and log-minus-log 
blots and confirmed by Schoenfeld and Martingale residuals, 
respectively. We also used a Kaplan-Meier survival model for the 
plotting of fracture-free survival curves with the corresponding 
log rank test. Change in mean 25(OH)D levels within groups over 
time was compared with paired-samples t test. Change in the use 
of prescribed vitamin D in the control group during the follow-up 
was analyzed with the McNemar test. All statistical analyses were 
performed with SPSS for Windows 14.0 statistical software. 


Initially, 3432 women were considered eligible and were enrolled 
and randomized. After randomization, 237 women were exc- 
luded from the analyses, 132 from the intervention group and 
105 from the control group (Fig. 1). In the intervention group, all 
exclusions were due to consent withdrawals. 
In the control 
group, 83 women were excluded owing to consent withdrawal, 
15 owing to death before onset of the trial, and 7 owing to loss of 
contact before the first telephone interview. A total of 1586 
women in the intervention group and 1609 women in the 
control group were assigned to treatment. During follow-up, 20 
women in the intervention group and 36 women in the control 
group were lost from the study. Of the 375 subjects randomly 
selected from each group, 290 in the intervention group and 313 
in the control group were assigned to treatment. The mean time 
of follow-up was 3.01 (SD 0.22) years. 

The baseline characteristics of the study groups are summarized 
in Table 1. A history of previous fracture was more frequent 
and parental history of hip fracture was less frequent in the 
intervention group than in the control group (37.3% versus 
33.4%, p ¼ .02, and 11.9% versua 14.3%, p ¼ .05, respectively). 
There were no other differences between the intervention and 
control groups. We compared all baseline characteristics of 
the 237 women who were excluded from analyses in the 
intervention and control groups, and there were no statistically 




significant differences between the groups. Further, the baseline 
characteristics of the excluded subjects were compared with 
those of the subjects who remained in the study. This analysis 
showed a typical exclusion effect: The excluded subjects had 
statistically significantly higher body weight (72.8 versus 70.7 kg, 
p ¼ .03) and BMI (28.5 versus 27.7, p ¼ .04) and lower self- 
assessed physical ability (restricted walking 21.9% versus 9.5%, 
p < .0001). Further, there were fewer hormone therapy (HT) users 
(40.0% versus 52.3%, p < .0001), and the duration of HT among 
users was shorter (8.6 versus 10.5 years, p ¼ .03) among excluded 
subjects. Similarly, the proportions of smokers (9.1% versus 5.2%, 
p ¼ .02), subjects with a history of previous fractures (42.6% 
versus 35.3%, p ¼ .02), and subjects not using any alcohol (60.8% 
versus 49.3%, p ¼ .01) were higher. 
reasons, and 4 reporting no reason. The most common adverse 
effects causing discontinuation were gastrointestinal symptoms 
(64 of 220), nausea (12 of 220), and skin reactions (9 of 220). 
Compliance data were available for 1508 of 1586 subjects 
(95.1%) in the intervention group who were assigned to treat- 
ment. Mean compliance in the intervention group was 78%. At 
the same time, in control group, intake of prescribed vitamin D 
was elevated from 3.8% to 16.1% ( p < .001) during follow- 
up.Fractures 
During follow-up, a total of 189 fractures occurred in 172 
subjects. The most common type of fracture was a distal forearm 
fracture (n ¼ 60). The number of hip (n ¼ 6) and proximal humeral 
(n ¼ 12) fractures was very low, and risk assessment for these 
fracture types cannot be considered adequate. The distribution of 
different fracture types by groups is displayed in Table 2. 

In the intervention group, 1566 women completed the follow- 
up, and 220 of these discontinued the intervention, 113 owing to 
adverse effects of the treatment, 103 owing to other reported 

In ITT analyses, the hazard ratio (HR) for any fracture in the 
intervention group compared with the control group was 0.85

HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.3–1.66), and the aHR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.29–

the aHR was 1.02 (95% CI 0.58–1.80; Table 3 and Fig. 2). The 
intervention showed no statistically significant effect on fracture 
risk in any of these fractures. The fracture-free survival curves for 
any fracture and upper extremity fractures are shown in Fig. 3. 

We also analyzed antifracture efficacy of the supplementation in 
seven different subgroups (age (cid:2) 70 years, age (cid:2) 68 years, 
calcium intake (cid:3) 700 mg/d, treatment received at any compli- 
ance, treatment received with 90% or greater compliance, and 
prescribed vitamin D (users in the control group excluded, 
subjects with secondary osteoporosis in both groups excluded). 
None of these subgroups provided a statistically significant 
( p < .05) effect in favor of the intervention (data not shown).

50.0 nmol/L (SD 18.7 nmol/L) was elevated by 49% to 74.6 (21.9) 
nmol/L ( p < .001) during follow-up. In the control group, the 
change by 14% from a baseline of 49.1 (17.7) nmol/L to 55.9 
(21.9) nmol/L was remarkably smaller but statistically significant 
( p < .001). 

Supplemented cholecalciferol 800 IU/day and calcium 1000 mg/ 
day caused a clear increase in serum 25(OH)D levels of 49%, 
indicating a compliant use of the supplementation. In the control 
group, a smaller but significant increase of 14% was measured. 
25(OH)D levels of 75 nmol/L or higher have been considered 
sufficient for antifracture efficacy.(31) In the intervention group, 
the mean vitamin D concentration (74.6 nmol/L) reached this 
level. Further, this intervention showed a trend toward dec- 
reasing the risk of any fracture by 17%, any nonvertebral fracture 
by 13%, distal forearm fractures by 30%, and any osteoporotic 
the supplementation decreased 
fracture by 19%. Further, 
upper extremity fractures by 25% in contrast to those of the 
lower extremity, where no effect was seen. However, none of 
these risk reductions reached statistical significance. We also 
have shown a lower risk of recurrent falling in the same vitamin

The result of the decreasing trend of fracture incidence with 
supplementation seems to be consistent with previous literature. 
Some factors cause limitations that may have reduced the effect 
of the intervention in this study. First, the population in this 
study was relatively young and healthy, and therefore, fracture 
incidence was lower than expected. Further, the effect size of the 
intervention was lower than expected. This study was powered 
D–supplemented group.(32) This is in concordance with our 
findings—fractures are often a consequence of falling. 
Previous data on the antifracture efficacy of low-dose vitamin 
D ((cid:3)400 IU) are somewhat controversial. Randomized trials in 
Dutch (n ¼ 2578) and Norwegian (n ¼ 1144) populations(20,21) 
have not shown a fracture-protective effect. However, a Danish 
study of 9605 subjects(18) showed a 16% reduction in fracture 
incidence rate in a nonrandomized setting. Further, Jackson and 
colleagues reported a 29% risk reduction in hip fractures 
with low-dose (400 IU) vitamin D in women with high ((cid:2)80%) 
adherence to treatment(33) in the randomized Women’s Health 
Initiative (WHI) study (n ¼ 36,282). Several trials with a higher 
vitamin D dose (700 to 800 IU) showed a clear antifracture 
effect,(14,16,17) whereas some with an even higher dosage (800 to 
remained negative.(22–27) According to several 
1000 IU) 
metaanalyses, in selected subjects, vitamin D in sufficient dose 
(>600 IU/d) clearly reduces the incident nonvertebral and hip 
fractures,(8–10) and a dose-response effect exists.(34) Further, 
calcium supplementation additionally decreases 
fracture 
risk.(9,10) A trend toward upper extremity fracture risk reduction, 
as suggested by this study, was not reported in any of these trials. 
However, this same finding has been reported by Heikinheimo 
and colleagues(19) 
in a Finnish population with annual 
intramuscular injections of 150,000 to 300,000 IU of ergocalci- 
ferol. While this has been reported only in these two Finnish 
trials, 
it is possible that the preventive effect, that is, the 
improvement in balance, has a clearer effect on falling in high 
northern latitudes, where snow-related slips/falls are more 
frequent.

to detect a 30% decrease in fracture rate with an expected 
incidence of 30 per 1000 per year, an estimate based on a 
Swedish study.(30) The supplementation seemed to decrease the 
fracture risk by only 17%. The detected incidence of first fracture 
also was smaller: 18 per 1000 per year. Thus this study did not 
have enough power to show statistical significance for the 
treatment effect in this population. Second, owing to consi- 
derable vitamin D deficiency in the Finnish population, milk 
products (ie, milk, sour milk, and yoghurt) and fat products (ie, 
butter and margarine) have been fortified with cholecalciferol at 
0.5 mg/100 mL and 10 mg/100 g, respectively, since 2003, that is, 
over the whole duration of this trial.(5) Regardless of supplement 
use in control ssujects, milk and fat products thus form a source 
of moderate basal 
intake of vitamin D in the control group. 
Further, baseline levels of vitamin D were quite high in both 
groups (50.0 and 49.1 nmol/L) and were not too far from the 
fracture-protecting threshold of 75 nmol/L. Third, the additive 
role of calcium supplementation in fracture prevention has been 
recognized.(9,10,35) In the present population, the mean nutri- 
tional calcium intake was relatively high, 895 mg/day in both 
groups, reflecting the exceptionally high use of milk products in 
Finland. High nutritional calcium intake may mask part of the 
additional positive effect of supplementation in this trial. Fourth, 
only 3432 of 5407 women were enrolled in this study, which may 
limit the benefit of low selection bias of a population-based trial. 
Further, the exclusion of the 237 dropouts may cause exclusion 
bias in the study. Typically, subjects who have low adherence 
are older and have more health disorders and medications, so 
they also may have a higher risk of fracture. Fifth, an open-label 
design with a free control group has the disadvantage that 
awareness of the health benefits of the intervention may inc- 
rease the use of supplementation in the control group and dilute 
the effect. In fact, at the end of follow-up, the use of prescribed 
vitamin D was almost fourfold compared with baseline. The mild 
increase in the mean 25(OH)D level (14%) in the control group 
may reflect this change. An open-label design also may have 
In this study, this 
caused biased reporting of endpoint data. 
effect is probably not present because a fracture is an easily 
recalled "hard" surrogate outcome measure. The fracture-confir- 
mation process has been validated in the OSTPRE Study.(36) In 
our opinion, fracture in this study remains a very reliable out- 
come. Sixth, when analyzed on an ITT basis, the presence of 
nonadherent subjects in the intervention group dilutes the 
actual effect of the treatment. Finally, the fact that intervention 
elevates 25(OH)D to an acceptable level, 74.6 nmol/L, still means 
that half the sample remains below 75 nmol/L, the threshold for 
antifracture efficacy. In this manner, this trial also describes the in 
vivo efficacy of uncontrolled intake of the tested intervention on 
25(OH)D levels at the population level. 
The strength of this study lies in its population-based 
strategy for testing the antifracture efficacy of vitamin D and 
calcium. Considering our primary aim, testing the efficacy of a 
population-level intervention, this setting offers better exter- 
nal validity for the result than in many other studies con- 
centrating on high-risk subjects. Further, this population is not 
limited to institutionalized women but consists of a more 
complete variety of subjects with different housing status, 
functional capacity, and health status. The mean compliance of 
this study, 78%, was sufficient 
achievable effect of the intervention. 

In conclusion, supplementation of 800 IU of cholecalciferol 
and 1000 mg of calcium daily as a population-level preventive 
strategy failed to produce a statistically significant reduction in 
fracture risk. A population of relatively young age and in good 
health combined with a good basal intake of vitamin D and 
calcium does not achieve the benefit in fracture prevention. For 
this purpose, the supplementation needs to be targeted more 
effectively.
