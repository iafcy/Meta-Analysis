controlled trials investigating 
the effects of cholecalciferol 
(vitamin D) supplementation 
on falls and fractures have been incon- 
sistent.1-13 Some meta-analyses con- 
clude that 700 to 800 IU of vitamin D 
daily reduces fracture risk by 13% to 
26%,14-18 whereas others conclude that 
vitamin D is ineffective. A Cochrane 
analysis19 and the Vitamin D Indi- 
vidual Patient Analysis of Random- 
ized Trials (DIPART) group,20 pub- 
lished after this study commenced, 
showed a nonstatistically significant in- 
crease in hip fracture risk associated 
with vitamin D supplementation.19-21 
Studies have observed those living in 
long-term care facilities as having 
greater fracture risk reduction than 
community-dwelling elders. Simi- 
larly, fewer fractures were observed in 
participants whose study treatment was 
coadministered with calcium.4,5,16,22 Fur- 
thermore, many studies have found 
treatment adherence to be low1,2,6 and 
fracture risk reduction was greater 
among adherent than nonadherent pa- 

Context Improving vitamin D status may be an important modifiable risk factor to re- 
duce falls and fractures; however, adherence to daily supplementation is typically poor. 
Objective To determine whether a single annual dose of 500 000 IU of cholecalcif- 
erol administered orally to older women in autumn or winter would improve adher- 
ence and reduce the risk of falls and fracture. 
Design, Setting, and Participants A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 2256 
community-dwelling women, aged 70 years or older, considered to be at high risk of 
fracture were recruited from June 2003 to June 2005 and were randomly assigned to 
receive cholecalciferol or placebo each autumn to winter for 3 to 5 years. The study 
concluded in 2008. 

Main Outcome Measures Falls and fractures were ascertained using monthly cal- 
endars; details were confirmed by telephone interview. Fractures were radiologically 
confirmed. In a substudy, 137 randomly selected participants underwent serial blood 
sampling for 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and parathyroid hormone levels. 
Results Women in the cholecalciferol (vitamin D) group had 171 fractures vs 135 in 
the placebo group; 837 women in the vitamin D group fell 2892 times (rate, 83.4 per 
100 person-years) while 769 women in the placebo group fell 2512 times (rate, 72.7 
per 100 person-years; incidence rate ratio [RR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.02-1.30; P=.03). The incidence RR for fracture in the vitamin D group was 1.26 
(95% CI, 1.00-1.59; P=.047) vs the placebo group (rates per 100 person-years, 4.9 
vitamin D vs 3.9 placebo). A temporal pattern was observed in a post hoc analysis of 
falls. The incidence RR of falling in the vitamin D group vs the placebo group was 1.31 
in the first 3 months after dosing and 1.13 during the following 9 months (test for 
homogeneity; P = .02). In the substudy, the median baseline serum 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol was 49 nmol/L. Less than 3% of the substudy participants had 
25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels lower than 25 nmol/L. In the vitamin D group, 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol levels increased at 1 month after dosing to approximately 120 
nmol/L, were approximately 90 nmol/L at 3 months, and remained higher than the 
placebo group 12 months after dosing. 
Conclusion Among older community-dwelling women, annual oral administration 
of high-dose cholecalciferol resulted in an increased risk of falls and fractures.

tients.1,16,22 The evidence of vitamin D 
efficacy in preventing falls suggests that 
daily doses of at least 700 IU reduce falls 
by 19% to 26%.23 
We hypothesized that high-dose cho- 
lecalciferol (500 000 IU) given orally 
once a year to community-dwelling 
older women would reduce falls and 
fractures. The rationale for this dose was 
based on data that an oral dose of 
500 000 IU (administered as 50 000 IU 
daily for 10 days) produced a mean 
(SD) increase in 25-hydroxycholecal- 
ciferol of 32 (15) nmol/L at 17 (7) 
weeks after dose24 and was supported 
by fracture-reduction benefits using 
300 000 of IU cholecalciferol (admin- 
istered as 100 000 IU every 4 months)3 
and 150 000 to 300 000 IU of ergocal- 
ciferol administered intramuscularly as 
a single annual dose.7 The study was de- 
signed so that the vitamin D treatment 
would prevent decreases in 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol over winter,25 
address low adherence, and be a prac- 
tical intervention easily translated to 
clinical practice. 
METHODS 
Study Design 
The Vital D study was a single-center, 
double-blind, randomized, placebo- 
controlled trial involving women 70 
years or older residing in southern Vic- 
toria, Australia (latitude 38°S). The par- 
ticipants were recruited between 2003 
and 2005 and were randomly as- 
signed to receive either a single oral 
dose of cholecalciferol 500 000 IU or 
matched placebo each year for 3 to 5 
years (in autumn or winter). Partici- 
pants were followed up for 12 months 
after their last dose of study medica- 
tion in 2007. 
The study was approved by the in- 
stitutional review boards of Barwon 
Health and the University of Mel- 
bourne and carried out in compliance 
with the Helsinki Declaration. All par- 
ticipants provided written informed 
consent. 
The study recruited 2317 commu- 
nity-dwelling women as previously de- 
scribed.26 Invitation letters were sent to 
all age-eligible women listed on the elec- 
toral roll of the region surrounding the 
study center. Voting is compulsory in 
Australia. 
Women were included in the study 
if they were at higher risk of hip frac- 
ture,27 defined by criteria such as ma- 
ternal hip fracture, past fracture, or self- 
reported faller.26 Women were excluded 
if they could not provide informed 
consent or information about falls or 
fractures; permanently resided at a high- 
level care facility; had an albumin- 
corrected calcium level higher than 2.65 
mmol/L; or had a creatinine level higher 
than 150 µmol/L, or currently took 
vitamin D doses of 400 IU or more, cal- 
citriol, or antifracture therapy. (To con- 
vert calcium from mmol/L to mg/dL, 
divide by 0.25; creatinine from µmol/L 
to mg/dL, divide by 88.4; and serum vi- 
tamin D from nmol/L to ng/mL, di- 
vide by 2.496.) 
Eligible participants were random- 
ized to receive either 500 000 IU of 
cholecalciferol or identical placebo. 
Allocation was performed by an inde- 
pendent statistician using computer- 
generated randomization of numbers 
performed in blocks of 500. Treatment 
allocation status was e-mailed directly 
to the hospital clinical trials pharma- 
cist responsible for dispensing study 
medication. The participants and 
study staff were blinded to interven- 
tion group. 
Study medication was supplied by 
PSM Healthcare, Auckland, New Zea- 
land. Ten tablets were mailed to par- 
ticipants annually (March-August, de- 
termined by recruitment date) with 
instructions to take all tablets on a single 
day. Study staff confirmed by tele- 
phone the ingestion of study medica- 
tion within 2 weeks. Subsequent dos- 
ing occurred within 2 weeks of the 
anniversary of the first dose. 
Outcome Measures 
Participants’ age, calcium intake, and 
fracture-risk profile were collected at 
baseline by questionnaire. Falls were de- 
fined as “an event reported either by the 
faller or a witness, resulting in a per- 
son inadvertently coming to rest on the 
ground or another lower level, with or 
without loss of consciousness or in- 
jury.”28 This definition was explained 
to participants and reinforced twice 
yearly via newsletter. 
All contact with participants was by 
mail and telephone. Falls and frac- 
tures were recorded using postcard cal- 
endars completed daily by writing F if 
they had a fall, fracture, or both and N 
if they did not and were returned 
monthly by prepaid post.26,29 Partici- 
pants unable to send postcards were 
telephoned monthly. 
When a fall or fracture was indi- 
cated, a standardized questionnaire re- 
cording details was administered by 
telephone. Only fractures radiologi- 
cally confirmed were included in the 
analyses. Seventy-three self-reports

were unconfirmed because of 1 of the 
following reasons: (1) not x-rayed (eg, 
suspected rib fracture), 13 vitamin D 
vs 15 placebo; (2) radiologist’s report 
stated no fracture, 19 vitamin D vs 23 
placebo; and (3) vertebral deformity 
with less than 20% height reduction, 2 
vitamin D vs 1 placebo. Falls were clas- 
sified as “resulting from active behav- 
ior”’ when the participant, at the time 
of the fall, was walking, gardening, 
shopping, doing housework, engag- 
ing in sports, rushing, or climbing a lad- 
der or chair. Other circumstances sur- 
rounding falls were classified as 
nonactive behavior. Calcium intake was 
quantified annually by questionnaire.30 
The 150 substudy participants were 
randomly selected and results were as- 
sayed in a manner blinded to treat- 
ment group. Serum 25-hydroxychole- 
calciferol (DiaSorin, Stillwater, 
Minnesota) and intact parathyroid hor- 
mone ([PTH]; Advia Centaur Si- 
emens, Deerfield, Illinois) was mea- 
sured at baseline and 12 months after 
dose. In 2006 and 2007, measure- 
ments were also performed 1 and 3 
months after dose. 
Sample Size 
Based on 80% power and 5% level of 
significance, we calculated that 6855 
person-years were needed to detect a 
22% relative difference in fracture rates.7 
Our previous work demonstrates a 3.3% 
fracture rate among women older than 
70 years31 and suggests that hip and 
forearm fractures could be reduced by 
16% and 31%, respectively, if summer- 
time fracture rates were maintained 
throughout the year.32 By using inclu- 
sion criteria based on risk factors for hip 
fracture, we estimated that our study 
participants would have a fracture rate 
3-fold higher than community- 
dwelling women of the same age. 
Statistical Methods 
All analyses were intention-to-treat. Fall 
and fracture data were inclusive from 
date of first study medication to either 
completion or the last complete month 
of data (withdrawn or lost to follow- 
up). Initial comparisons of outcome

measures between treatment groups 
were performed using (cid:2)2 tests or Wil- 
coxon rank-sum tests, as appropriate. 
The primary outcome measures, num- 
bers of falls and fractures, were ana- 
lyzed using Poisson regression mod- 
els with robust standard errors to allow 
for nonindependence of multiple events 
for the same participant. The models in- 
cluded only treatment group but were 
also fitted adjusting for baseline cal- 
cium intake ((cid:3)800 mg, 800-1100 mg, 
1100-1300 mg, or (cid:4)1300 mg) and age. 
The data were also analyzed using nega- 
tive binomial regression models that ex- 
plicitly allow for overdispersion. For 
comparison with similar studies, time 
to first fracture and fall was analyzed 
using Cox proportional hazards mod- 
els. Kaplan-Meier plots of cumulative 
incidence are presented. 
Post hoc analyses were undertaken 
to investigate the relationship be- 
tween the treatment effect and time 
since ingesting the annual dose. Each 
year of follow-up was split into 2 fol- 
low-up segments: at 3 months and 9 
months after dosing. A generalized es- 
timating equation approach was used 
to allow for correlation between a par- 
ticipant’s falls and fractures at the dif- 
ferent time periods. Estimated inci- 
dence rate ratios (RRs) for 0 through 
3 months and 4 through 12 months af- 
ter dosing are presented with the P value 
testing for homogeneity of the 2 inci- 
dence RRs. 
No adjustment was made for mul- 
tiple testing. All P values are 2-sided to 
detect differences, P (cid:3) .05. Analyses 
were performed in Stata 10.1 (Stata- 
Corp, College Station, Texas). 
Although adverse events were moni- 
tored, there was not a data and safety 
monitoring board or stopping rules be- 
cause at the time the study com- 
menced, these were not usual practice 
for vitamin D randomized controlled 
trials. US Food and Drug Administra- 
tion and European Medicines Agency 
guidelines did not indicate a need, and 
based on published data, we had no ex- 
pectation of harm. 
RESULTS 
Enrollment and outcomes are shown in 
FIGURE 1. There was no difference be- 
tween the treatment groups in the pro- 
portion who withdrew nor in the 
reasons for withdrawal. All other par- 




ticipants were followed up until the pre- 
determined study end in 2008. The pro- 
portion who commenced antifracture 
therapy during the intervention pe- 
riod did not differ (90 of 1131 in the 
vitamin D vs 87 of 1125 in the placebo 
group; P=.84). 
The groups did not differ signifi- 
cantly by age, risk profile, calcium in- 
take, or biochemistry (TABLE 1). The pro- 
portion who received medication in each 
month (March-August) was evenly dis- 
tributed between the groups (P=.66). 
On 163 occasions, participants did 
not receive a dose of study medication 
but continued to participate in the 
study and were included in the analy- 
sis. On 105 of these occasions, doses 
were held because 44 in the vitamin D 
and 61 in the placebo group reported 
taking more than 400 IU of vitamin D 
supplementation. On 58 occasions, 33 
in the vitamin D and 25 in the pla- 
cebo group declined a dose of study 
medication. Ingestion of study medi- 
cation was confirmed annually for all

other participants. At the end of the 
study, approximately 6% in the pla- 
cebo group (as of 2008, 65 of 1125) 
and 3% (38 of 1131) in the vitamin D 
group were taking more than 400 
IU/d of vitamin D supplements. 
Fall Outcomes 
The 2256 participants had a total of 
5404 falls over 6925 person-years. Sev- 
enty-four percent of 1131 women in the 
vitamin D group and 68% of 1125 
women in the placebo group had at least 
1 fall (TABLE 2). The vitamin D group 
had 2892 falls at a rate of 83.4 per 100 
person-years vs 2512 in the placebo 
group at a rate of 72.7 per 100 person- 
years (incidence RR, 1.15; (95% CI, 
1.02-1.30; P = .03; TABLE 3). The re- 
sults did not change after adjusting for 
age nor when analyzed using negative 
binomial regression to allow for overdis- 
persion. The cumulative incidence of 
first fall was increased in the vitamin 
D group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.16; 95% 
CI, 1.05-1.28; P=.003; FIGURE 2). 
Increased falls in the vitamin D 
group were observed for each classi- 
fication of falls: falls with fracture, 
falls without fracture, and falls with 
soft tissue injury (Table 2). The pro- 
portion of falls that resulted in a phy- 
sician visit did not differ: 27.2% (778 
of 2892) in the vitamin D group vs 
26.1% (657 of 2512) in the placebo 
group. 
Fracture Outcomes 
One hundred fifty-five women receiv- 
ing vitamin D sustained 171 fractures 
and 125 receiving placebo sustained 
135 fractures (Table 2). The fracture 
rate in the vitamin D group was 4.9 per 
100 person-years vs 3.9 in the placebo 
group. The incidence RR for fracture 
was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.00-1.59; P=.047) 
compared with the placebo group. Simi- 
larly, the nonvertebral fracture RR was 
1.28 in the vitamin D group (inci- 
dence RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.00-1.65; 
P=.06). The HR cumulative incidence 
of first fracture was 1.26 in the vita- 
min D group compared with the pla- 
cebo group (95% CI, 0.99-1.59; P=.06; 
Figure 2). 




group and 58 from the placebo group. 
One sample from each group was ex- 
cluded because 25-hydroxycholecal- 
ciferol levels of 123 nmol/L and 115 
nmol/L suggested that the women were 
taking more than 400 IU vitamin D 
supplementation per day. 
At baseline, the median 25-hydroxy- 
cholecalciferol level was 49 nmol/L 
(IQR, 40-63; normal lower limit, (cid:4)50 
nmol/L). Less than 3% of the sub- 
study participants had 25-hydroxycho- 
lecalciferol levels lower than 25 nmol/L. 
The 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and 
PTH levels did not differ between the 
groups (Table 1). Approximately half 
of the substudy participants had 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol levels of 50 
nmol/L or lower (vitamin D, 45.9% vs 
61.4%, placebo) but less than 5% had 
levels of 25 nmol/L or lower (vitamin 
D, 4.0% vs 3.5%, placebo). 
In each year of the study, samples 
were obtained 12 months after dose 
(ie, just prior to the second through 
fifth annual dose administrations and 
at study completion). There was a 
marked increase in 25-hydroxy- 
cholecalciferol levels in the vitamin D 
group with some evidence of this 
increase trailing off toward the end of 
the trial. The median 25-hydroxy- 
cholecalciferol levels 12 months after 
dose in the vitamin D group ranged 
from 55 nmol/L to 74 nmol/L over the 
5 intervals with individual values 
ranging from 25 nmol/L to 120 
nmol/L (FIGURE 3). The medians and 
IQRs of the PTH levels remained 
stable 12 months after dosing. 
In 2006 and 2007, samples were col- 
lected at 1 and 3 months after dose in 
102 (74%) of the substudy partici- 
pants. The median 25-hydroxychole- 
calciferol level in the vitamin D group 
1 month after dose was slightly 
more than 120 nmol/L with 82% at 
100 nmol/L or higher and 24% at

a The incidence rate ratio refers to the risk ratio of the vitamin D group compared with the placebo group. The rate ratio 
within 3 months after treatment is significantly different from the rate ratio of the remaining 9 months after treatment 
for falls (P=.02) but not for fracture (P=.36). 
The frequency of falls among women 
who sustained a fracture did not differ 
between groups with a median of 2 
falls (interquartile range [IQR], 1-4) 
throughout the study course. 
Temporal Effect of Annual Dose 
The incidence RR of falls in the vitamin 
D group was 1.31 in the first 3 months 
(95% CI, 1.12-1.54) following dosing, 
but only 1.13 (95% CI, 0.99-1.29) dur- 
ing the remaining 9 months of the year 
(P value for homogeneity=.02; TABLE 4). 
The temporal pattern of excess falls was 
observed each year except the first year. 
Although not statistically signifi- 
cant, the temporal pattern observed in 
falls was also observed in fractures 
(Table 3). The vitamin D fracture in- 
cidence RR compared with the pla- 
cebo group was 1.53 (95% CI, 0.95- 
2.46) in the first 3 months after dosing 
and 1.18 (95% CI, 0.91-1.54) during the 
following 9 months. 
Calcium Intake 
and Questionnaire Data 
The proportion of participants with cal- 
cium intake of less than 800 mg/d de- 
creased from 33% at baseline to 27% 
over the subsequent annual assess- 
ments, whereas the proportion con- 
suming 1100 mg or more increased 
from 40% to 46%. There was no differ- 
ence between the groups in the catego- 
ries of calcium intake (Table 1). The 
median daily calcium intake was 976 
mg (IQR, 691-1311 mg). 
Theincreasedriskofbothfallsandfrac- 
tures in the vitamin D group did not

incidence RR of falling was 1.16 (95% CI, 
1.03-1-31); for fracture, 1.25 (95% CI, 
0.99-1-58; Table 3) in the vitamin D 
group. The groups had a similar propor- 
tion of falls occurring during active be- 
havior (79% vs 81%, respectively).

those invited to participate in the bio- 
chemistry substudy consented. Base-

COMMENT 
Contrary to our hypothesis, partici- 
pants receiving annual high-dose oral 
cholecalciferol experienced 15% more 
falls and 26% more fractures than the 
placebo group. Women not only expe- 
rienced excess fractures after more fre- 
quent falls but also experienced more 
fractures that were not associated with 
a fall. A post hoc analysis found that the 
increased likelihood of falls in the vi- 
tamin D group was exacerbated in the 
3-month period immediately follow- 
ing the annual dose and a similar tem- 
poral trend was observed for frac- 
tures. An increased risk (albeit, not 
significant because of smaller num- 
bers) of falls and fracture in the vita- 
min D group was apparent for each year 
of the intervention. The results were 
similar after adjustment for baseline cal- 
cium intake; age was not included in 
the models because its inclusion did not 
affect the model estimates. 
Data from the substudy indicate that 
the participants had intermediate 25-hy- 
droxycholecalciferol levels at baseline, 
typical of community-dwelling older 
women of the region25 and typical of older 
women in Northern Europe and North 
America.33 The intervention effectively 
increased background 25-hydroxycho- 
lecalciferol levels. Predictably, the lev- 
els increased substantially 1 month after 
dosing and thereafter declined toward 
baseline but remaining on average 41% 
higher than levels in the placebo group 
at 12 months. The pattern is consistent 
with serial measurements done in older 
New Zealanders supplemented with 
500 000 IU cholecalciferol.34 
Only 1 other study has reported an in- 
crease in fracture associated with vita- 
min D treatment.8 Participants (4354 
men, 5086 women) 75 years or older re- 
ceived an annual injection of 300 000 IU 
vitamin D2 as ergocalciferol or placebo. 
In men, treatment had no effect on frac- 
tures. However women treated with vi- 
tamin D had increased risk of nonver- 
tebral (HR, 1.21), hip/femur (HR, 1.80), 
and hip/femur/wrist/forearm fractures 
150 nmol/L or higher (FIGURE 4). By 
3 months, the after-dose median 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol levels de- 
creased to approximately 90 nmol/L in 
the vitamin D group. 
Adverse Events 
A similar number of participants in each 
group reported at least 1 adverse event: 
19.7% in the vitamin D and 17.8% in 
the placebo group. The most common 
adverse events were injury including 
fracture—15.2% (172 of 1131) of 
women taking vitamin D vs 12.1% (136 
of 1125) taking placebo (P = .03)— 
and cardiovascular events—1.5% (171 
of 1131) vs 1.2% (13 of 1125), respec- 
tively. Seven women (0.6%) in the vi- 
tamin D group vs 10 (0.9%) in the pla- 
cebo group were diagnosed with cancer. 
Serious adverse events (Interna- 
tional Conference on Harmonization/ 
WHO Good Clinical Practice defini- 
tion including hospitalization or death) 
did not differ significantly: 244 among 
women taking vitamin D vs 207 women 
taking placebo (P=.06). Eighty-seven 
participants died during the study, 40 
taking vitamin D vs 47 taking pla- 
cebo. None of the serious adverse events

Serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol levels in the vita- 
min D group differ from those of the placebo group 
at all 12-month assessments after dose (P(cid:3).05). The 
medians are shown as the horizontal bar within the 
rectangle and the interquartile range as the ends of 
the rectangle. The 5th and 95th percentiles are shown 
as lines (whiskers), and the closed circles represent out- 
liers. The proportion of biochemistry substudy par- 
ticipants categorized into 25-hydroxycholecalciferol sta- 
tus is (vitamin D group, n=74 vs placebo group, n=57, 
respectively) 25 nmol/L or less: 4% vs 3.5%; 26 to 
50 nmol/L: 41.9% vs 57.9%; 51 to 74 nmol/L: 44.5% 
vs 33.3%; 75 nmol/L or higher: 9.5% vs 5.3%. To

(HR, 1.59). No effect on falls was ob- 
served; however, falls were a second- 
ary outcome and ascertainment was 
based on 6-month recall. Baseline and 
changes in 25-hydroxycholecalciferol 
and PTH levels were very similar to our 
results. Another common feature was 
that calcium supplements were not 
given. Whether calcium supplementa- 
tion is beneficial in vitamin D interven- 
tion studies is uncertain. Studies that 
have shown reductions in fracture with 
vitamin D therapy have variously 
used4,9,10 or not used3,7 a calcium supple- 
ment. The RECORD (Randomised 
Evaluation of Calcium or Vitamin D)2 
study showed no benefit of adding cal- 
cium to vitamin D, using a factorial ran- 
domized study design. 
The study of Chapuy et al4 treated fe- 
male nursing home residents (mean 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol level, 36 
nmol/L) with 800 IU of oral cholecal- 
ciferol plus 1.2 g of calcium or pla- 
cebo taken daily. Hip and nonverte- 
bral fractures were significantly reduced 
by about 25%. Likewise, in community- 
dwelling men and women random- 
ized to receive 100 000 IU of oral cho- 
lecalciferol in 4 monthly doses, Trivedi 
et al3 showed reductions in any frac- 
ture and fracture at the hip, wrist, fore- 
arm, or spine. Other studies report 
either reductions7,9,10 or no effect1,2,6,11,35 
in fracture rates in the active groups. 
The Women’s Health Initiative study1 
showed no effect of daily calcium plus 
400 IU of cholecalciferol on fractures. 
The RECORD study2 showed no effect 
in secondary prevention of fractures or 
falls in elderly participants treated daily 
with 800 IU of cholecalciferol alone, 
cholecalciferol plus calcium, or cal- 
cium alone, although only 54% were 
still taking study medication at 24 
months. Other studies using intermit- 
tent oral vitamin D in older people liv- 
ing in residential care did not show any 
reduction in fractures.11,13 
Meta-analyses suggest that there is a 
threshold level for vitamin D supple- 
mentation of more than 400 IU daily 
for fracture risk reduction and that re- 
ductions in hip and nonvertebral frac- 
tures are independent of calcium 
supplementation.14-18 Doses of 700 to 
800 IU daily reduced the risk of non- 
vertebral and hip fractures with stron- 
ger evidence of benefit in reducing hip 
fracture risk when the analysis was re- 
stricted to institutionalized adults.18 By 
contrast, a Cochrane review20 con- 
cluded that vitamin D therapy alone ap- 
peared unlikely to be effective in pre- 
venting fracture. 
Evidence of risk reduction of falls 
with vitamin D supplementation with 
and without calcium is also inconsis- 
tent. Overall there appears to be an 11% 
to 19% reduction in fall risk with 
supplementation and a possible dose 
threshold of 700 to 1000 IU daily.18,23 
No fall risk reduction was observed for 
doses of less than 700 IU or achieved 
serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol lev- 
els of less than 60 nmol/L, consistent 
with an earlier review of trials using 
varying doses of vitamin D that con- 
cluded that there was insufficient evi- 
dence that cholecalciferol treatment re- 
duced falls.36 Currently 600 IU (15 µg) 
per day is recommended for adults 70 
years or older in the United States and 
Canada 37,38 with an upper limit of 2000 
IU per day (~700 000 IU per year). Cho- 
lecalciferol 1000 IU is listed on the Aus- 
tralian Register of therapeutic goods. Al- 
though our results cannot necessarily 
be applied to high-dose vitamin D ad- 
ministered in divided doses over the 
year, they suggest that further study to 
assess safety is needed. 
The major strength of our study is 
that it was a large randomized, double- 
blind, placebo-controlled trial. Falls 
and fracture ascertainment were ro- 
bust,29,39 although nonclinical verte- 
bral fractures would have been missed. 
The pragmatic design of the study pro- 
vided high potential for translation into 
public health policy and clinical prac- 
tice. The main weaknesses of the study 
are also related to its pragmatic de- 
sign—the participants were not evalu- 
ated at the study center so that base- 
line clinical information may have been 
missed. Biochemical assessment of all 
participants was not possible. We do not 
expect that any participants reached 
toxic levels of 25-hydroxycholecalcif- 
erol of 375 to 500 nmol/L40 because the 
highest level at 1 month in the bio- 
chemistry substudy was 208 nmol/L. 
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans 
given a single, large oral dose of cho- 
lecalciferol indicate that 25-hydroxy- 
cholecalciferol levels peak at 7 to 21 
days and thereafter decrease slowly 
(half-life, 60-90 days), so it is likely the 
peak levels were only marginally higher 
than the 1-month levels.24,41 Further- 
more, the incremental increase in 25- 
hydroxycholecalciferol is likely to be 
lower in those already replete prior to 
supplementation.34 
This is the first study to demon- 
strate increased risk of falls associated 
with any vitamin D intervention and the 
second study to demonstrate an in- 
creased fracture risk associated with an- 
nual high-dose vitamin D therapy in el- 
derly women. Our study used the 
largest total annual dose of vitamin D 
(500 000 IU) reported in any large ran- 
domized controlled trial, raising the 
possibility that the adverse outcome is 
dose-related. The opposing outcomes 
of 2 studies3,8 that used the same total 
annual dose (300 000 IU intramuscu- 
larly) suggest that the dosing regimen 
(ie, 4 monthly vs annually) rather than 
the total dose might determine the out- 
come. This line of reasoning is sup- 
ported by the temporal risk pattern that 
we observed and the fact that harm has 
not been reported in the numerous 
studies that have used more frequent 
dosing. Thus, it is reasonable to specu- 
late that high serum levels of vitamin 
D or metabolites resulting from the 
large annual dose, subsequent de- 
crease in the levels, or both might be 
causal. Furthermore, because the lev- 
els of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol dem- 
onstrated in this study could occur with 
other recommended dosing regi- 
mens,42,43 the outcome of this study sug- 
gests that safety of high-dose vitamin 
D supplementation warrants further 
study.
