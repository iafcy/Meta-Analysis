Abstract 
Aims/objective Conflicting data regarding cardiovascular 
effects of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and extra-skeletal 
effects of vitamin D supported the need for a definitive 
trial. The Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D 
Evaluation (TIDE) trial aimed to assess the effects of TZDs 
(rosiglitazone and pioglitazone) on cardiovascular out- 
comes and the effects of vitamin D (cholecalciferol) on 
cancers and mortality. 
Methods A large multicentre 3×2 factorial double-blind 
placebo-controlled randomised trial recruited from outpatient 
primary care and specialty clinics in 33 countries. From June 
2009 to July 2010, 1,332 people with type 2 diabetes and other 
cardiovascular risk factors aged ≥50 years whose HbA1c was

6.5–9.5% (48–80 mmol/mol) when using two or fewer 
glucose-lowering drugs were randomised by a central 
computer system to placebo (n=541), rosiglitazone 4– 
8 mg/day (n=399) or pioglitazone 30–45 mg/day (n=392); 
1,221 participants were randomised to placebo (n=614) or 
vitamin D 1,000 IU/day (n=607). Participants and all study 
personnel were blind to treatment allocation. The 
primary outcome for the TZD arm was the composite 
of myocardial infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death, 
and for the vitamin D arm it was cancer or all-cause 
death. All randomised participants were included in the 
primary analysis. 
Results From the study design, 16,000 people were to be 
followed for approximately 5.5 years. However, the trial 
was stopped prematurely because of regulatory concerns 
after a mean of 162 days without consideration of the 
accrued data. In the TZD arm, the cardiovascular outcome 
occurred in five participants (0.9%) in the placebo groups 
and three participants (0.4%) in the TZD groups (two 
allocated to pioglitazone, one to rosiglitazone). In the 
the primary outcome occurred in three 
vitamin D arm, 
participants (0.5%) 
in the placebo group and in two 
participants (0.3%) receiving vitamin D. Adverse events 
were comparable in all groups. 
Conclusions/interpretation Uncertainty persists regarding 
the clinically relevant risks and benefits of TZDs and 
vitamin D because of 
this 
comprehensive trial.

Thiazolidinedione 


The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) rosiglitazone and pioglita- 
zone lower glucose levels without causing hypoglycaemia 
[1]. They also reduce many other cardiovascular risk factors 
including: incident diabetes [2, 3]; insulin resistance [4, 5]; 
blood pressure [6]; albuminuria [7]; renal disease [8, 9]; 
inflammatory markers [10]; revascularisation after percuta- 
neous coronary intervention [11]; and carotid [3, 12–14] 
and coronary atherosclerosis [15, 16]. These observations 
and analyses of data from administrative databases in 2005 
show that people prescribed TZDs may have fewer 
cardiovascular events or deaths than people prescribed 
other agents [17, 18] and suggest that TZDs may improve 
cardiovascular outcomes. This hypothesis gained support 
from trials showing that: (1) insulin-sensitising therapies 
(comprising mainly rosiglitazone plus metformin) had 
effects on mortality and cardiovascular events comparable 
with those of insulin-providing therapies in people with 
diabetes and proven coronary artery disease [19]; (2) the 
cardiovascular effects of rosiglitazone in combination with 
either metformin or a sulfonylurea were similar to those of 
metformin plus a sulfonylurea [20]; and (3) pioglitazone 
non-significantly reduced cardiovascular events compared 
the 
with a placebo [21]. However, 
methods of the latter two trials [22–24], the higher risk of 
heart failure with TZDs [25], analyses of other administrative 
databases, and inconclusive meta-analyses of mainly small 
trials comprising few events [26–30] raised uncertainty 
regarding the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone and the 
effects of the TZDs as a class. Collectively, these observa- 
tions highlighted the need for a definitive trial testing the 
hypothesis that TZDs may improve cardiovascular outcomes 
in patients with diabetes and other cardiovascular risk 
factors. 


type 2 diabetes is 
associated with low levels of vitamin D [31], and a growing 
body of evidence links vitamin D deficiency to many of the 
chronic diseases that occur 
in people with diabetes, 
including cancer [32] and cardiovascular disease [33, 34]. 
The possibility that vitamin D supplementation may reduce 
these risks was suggested by a recent meta-analysis of 18 
randomised controlled trials in which a mean of 528 IU/day 
of vitamin D reduced total mortality by 7% over a mean of 
5.7 years [35]. This, and evidence of a neutral effect of 
400 IU/day on cancers and cardiovascular outcomes [36– 
38] and a beneficial effect of 1,100 IU/day on cancer risk 
[39], suggest that higher doses of vitamin D might improve 
health outcomes in people with diabetes. 
The Thiazolidinedione Intervention with vitamin D 
Evaluation (TIDE) trial was designed to explicitly determine 
whether the TZDs and/or vitamin D can safely reduce 
clinically important outcomes. It was designed by an 
international scientific committee of ten experts in clinical 
trials, diabetes and cardiovascular disease plus a representa- 
tive from the sponsor (GlaxoSmithKline—the manufacturer 
of rosiglitazone), with input from representatives of the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) who approved the final 
design. Global implementation of TIDE was led by this group 
and 35 other experts. It was subsequently approved by a total 
of 33 regulatory agencies and 525 research ethics committees 
in 33 countries. Its progress and safety were monitored by an 
independent data-monitoring committee of five international 
experts. Notwithstanding these approvals and safeguards, 
there was ongoing public controversy regarding the safety of 
rosiglitazone [40], prompted by a US Senate Committee 
report [41], and an advisory board was convened by the 
FDA [42, 43]. On 21 July 2010, 
the FDA suspended 
recruitment 
into the trial, and on 23 September 2010 it 
required withdrawal of treatment for all participants enrolled 
in the TIDE trial. This paper reports the course of the TIDE 
trial and its accrued outcomes by treatment group in the 
context of these decisions. 

TIDE was a 3 × 2 factorial double-blind randomised 
placebo-controlled trial. Volunteers were enrolled from 
primary care, diabetes and cardiology clinics if they had 
type 2 diabetes and an HbA1c level ranging from 6.5% to 
9.5% (48 to 80 mmol/mol), were drug-naive or taking up to 
two non-insulin glucose-lowering medications, and were at 
risk of cardiovascular disease on the basis of: (1) age at 
least 50 years with a prior cardiovascular event; (2) age at 
least 55 years with documented arterial stenosis, albuminuria, 
ankle brachial index <0.9 or left ventricular hypertrophy; or 
(3) age at least 60 years with at least two risk factors (tobacco 
use, high LDL-cholesterol, 
low HDL-cholesterol or high 
triacylglycerols, hypertension or obesity). Key exclusion 
criteria were a cardiovascular event within 30 days before 
randomisation, history of pulmonary oedema, symptomatic 
heart failure (New York Heart Association class II–IV), 
known left ventricular ejection fraction below 40% or use of 
a loop diuretic, cancer diagnosed in the prior 3 years or active 
treatment for cancer (other than non-melanoma skin cancer or 
cervical carcinoma in situ), fracture in the prior year, known 


osteomalacia, or hypercalcaemia. The protocol and consent 
forms were approved by ethics committees at all recruiting 
centres, and all participants provided written informed 
consent. 
After 3 weeks of active rosiglitazone and vitamin D 
(cholecalciferol) run-in, participants were randomised by a 
central phone-in computer system to placebo, pioglitazone 
30 mg daily or rosiglitazone 4 mg daily at a 4:3:3 ratio. 
Doses were to be increased to pioglitazone 45 mg daily or 
rosiglitazone 8 mg daily by 12 months. Independent of their 
TZD allocation, participants were also randomised to 
placebo or vitamin D, 1,000 IU daily, in a 1:1 ratio. Due 
to manufacturing delays, the vitamin D study drug was not 
available at the start of the trial. Thus approximately 40% 
of the vitamin D participants were randomised to the 
vitamin D arm after randomisation to the TZD arm. The 
management of glucose levels and all other conditions was 
at the discretion of the local physician as informed by 
clinical practice guidelines and the relevant evidence; open- 
label TZDs were not permitted. Study visits were conducted 
2 and 6 months after randomisation and every 6 months 
thereafter. 
The primary outcome measure for the TZD arm was the 
first occurrence of the composite of myocardial infarction, 
stroke or cardiovascular death, and for the vitamin D arm it 
was all-cause death or cancers requiring hospitalisation, 
chemotherapy or surgery. Other outcomes included a 
composite microvascular outcome (the first occurrence of 
retinopathy requiring laser therapy or vitrectomy, or a 30% 
renal 
decline in estimated GFR [eGFR], or need for 
replacement therapy) for the TZD arm, and hospitalisation 
for heart 
failure, pneumonia or shortness of breath, 
hospitalisation for any reason, revascularisation and frac- 
tures for both study arms. All outcomes except decline in 
eGFR and hospitalisation for any reason were adjudicated 
according to prespecified criteria, without knowledge of 
study-group allocation. 
Serum calcium was measured at baseline, at 2 months 
and at the annual and end-of-study visits. Fasting lipids, 
serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were 
measured at baseline and end-of-study visits. Fasting 
plasma glucose and HbA1c were measured at baseline, 
after 1 year and at the end-of-study visits. All blood tests 
were assayed locally. To facilitate cross-site comparisons, 
if the upper limit of normal for the locally measured 
HbA1c result was not 6% (42 mmol/mol), the measured 
value was divided by the upper limit of normal and 
multiplied by 6%. HbA1c values measured using the 
International Federation of Clinical Chemistry or related 
methods were converted to the Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial-National Glycohaemoglobin Stand- 
ardisation Program (DCCT-NGSP) values using published 
regression equations [44]. 
Statistical analysis Sample size calculations showed that 
16,000 participants would provide approximately 90% 
power to detect a 20% or greater reduction in the primary 
outcome of TZDs vs placebo, assuming an annual event 
rate of 2%, 2 years of recruitment, 5.5 years of follow-up, 
and a two-sided α between 0.025 and 0.05. This sample 
size would include 10,888 people randomised to either 
rosiglitazone or placebo and would exclude a 30% excess 
of events with rosiglitazone compared with placebo using a 
one-sided α level of 0.0125 during a safety analysis after 
4.5 years. The study would also have 90% power to detect a 
26% reduction in mortality or serious cancer with vitamin 
D over 5.5 years and 18% over 10 years assuming an event 
rate of this composite outcome of 1% per year. 
Data were collected, stored and analysed centrally at the 
Population Health Research Institute project office inde- 
pendent of the sponsor. Statistical analyses were conducted 
using SAS version 9.1 software (SAS Institute). All group 
comparisons were done according to the intention-to-treat 
approach. Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses were 
planned. However, following early termination of the trial 
the scientific committee deter- 
and prior to unblinding, 
mined that such analyses would be inappropriate because of 
the small numbers of outcomes. Characteristics of partic- 
ipants at baseline and at the end of the study are tabulated 
as means±SD or number (percentage) and end-of-study 
comparisons were made by Student’s t tests or χ2 tests. 
Incidence rates of primary outcomes, secondary outcomes 
and any safety events were calculated by dividing the 
number of individuals experiencing an event by the person- 
years of follow-up (from randomisation to the time of an 
event or censoring). 

The first participant was randomised in June 2009. By the 
end of January 2010 a total of 143 randomised individuals, 
157 centres, and 18 countries were participating, and by the 
end of February when the US Senate report was released, 
this had risen rapidly to 204 participants, 202 centres, 
and 20 countries. By the time recruitment was sus- 
pended at the end of July 2010, 455 centres located in 
33 countries were eligible to recruit participants. 
However, despite the addition of 253 centres with ethics 
approvals after February, the proportion of centres that 
were screening participants 
subsequently decreased 
(Fig. 1). Thus, a total of 1332 participants were ultimately 
randomised in only 175 of the 455 centres to the TZD arm 
(541 to placebo, 392 to pioglitazone, and 399 to 
rosiglitazone) and 1,221 to the vitamin D arm (614 to 
placebo and 607 to vitamin D). Figure 1 illustrates the 


Baseline characteristics of participants were similar 
across allocated groups (Table 1). The mean age of 
participants was 66.4±6.6 years, 41% were women and 
35% had prior cardiovascular disease. The mean duration of 
diabetes was 8.8±6.9 years and the mean HbA1c was 7.4± 
0.9% (57±10 mmol/mol). Mean duration of follow-up was 
162 days (i.e. 590 person-years) for the TZD arm and 
130 days (i.e. 546 person-years) for the vitamin D arm. Of 
the 1325 surviving participants contacted before it was 
announced that the trial would be stopped, 90% (n=1,187) 
and 91% (n=1,018) were at least 80% adherent to the TZD 
and vitamin D study drugs, 
respectively (91% to 
placebo [n= 487], 87% to pioglitazone [n= 341], and 
91% to rosiglitazone [n=359]; 92% to placebo [n=519] 
and 91% to vitamin D [n=499]). A mean of 2.2% of 
participants stopped the study drug per month before the 
Senate report was publicised, whereas a mean of 2.5% of 
participants stopped the study drug per month in the 
3 months prior to the announcement of trial termination. 
Between that announcement and the end-of-study visit, 
participants were stopping the study drug at a high rate of 
18% per month; thus by the end-of-study visit, 39% of 
participants had stopped the TZD study drug (n=516) and 
34% had stopped the vitamin D study drug (n=417). The 
most common reasons for stopping the TZD study drug 
either temporarily or permanently during the trial were 
hearing that 
the trial was terminated (56%, n =288), 
adverse events (22%, n=115) and fear of adverse events 
(12%, n=62). The most common reasons for stopping the 
vitamin D study drug were hearing the trial was 
terminated (69%, n=288), adverse events (13%, n=56) 
and fear of adverse events (5%, n=21). 
Adjudicated outcomes are presented in Table 2 and 
the outcomes as reported (i.e. prior to adjudication) are 
shown in Electronic supplementary material 
(ESM) 
Table 1. The primary composite cardiovascular outcome 
occurred in five (0.9%) participants in the placebo group 
and three (0.4%) participants in the TZD group (two 
allocated to pioglitazone and one allocated to rosiglita- 
zone). The primary outcome for the vitamin D study (all- 
cause mortality or serious cancers) occurred in three 
(0.5%) placebo group participants and two (0.3%) 
vitamin D group participants. 
Physical measurements, metabolic variables and use of 
concomitant glucose-lowering medications at the end of the 
trial are shown in Table 3. Compared with placebo, 
participants randomised to a TZD (pioglitazone and 
rosiglitazone groups combined) achieved lower HbA1c 
(6.9% vs 7.3% [52 vs 56 mmol/mol], p<0.001), fasting 
plasma glucose (7.2 vs 8.0 mmol/l, p<0.001) and ALT (25 
vs 27 U/l, p=0.006), and increased their weight (88.0 vs 
85.2 kg, p=0.008) and BMI (31.5 vs 30.4 kg/m2, p=0.001).

Fig. 2 Trial profiles of participants based on allocation to (a) the TZD 
arm, and (b) the vitamin D arm. Multiple reasons are possible for 
excluded or non-completed individuals. The 111 participants rando- 
mised to the TZD arm were not randomised to the vitamin D arm 
because the vitamin D study drug was not available at the time of 
study termination 
slightly higher HbA1c (7.0% vs 6.8% [53 vs 51 mmol/mol], 
p = 0.024), and also higher 
triacylglycerols (2.10 vs 
1.67 mmol/l, p<0.001), and lower HDL-cholesterol (1.19 
vs 1.27 mmol/l, p=0.003) at the end of the trial. The use of 
statins, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, 
anti-platelet agents, diuretics and nitrates were similar at the 
end of the trial (data not shown). Vitamin D did not affect 
physical measurements, biochemistry (including serum 
calcium) or concomitant medication use. 
Severe hypoglycaemia (i.e. hypoglycaemia requiring 
assistance from another person, with either a documented 
plasma glucose≤2.0 mmol/l or prompt recovery after oral 
carbohydrate, intravenous glucose, or glucagon administra- 
tion) occurred in none of the participants in the placebo 
group, two (0.5%) in the pioglitazone group and one (0.3%) 
in the rosiglitazone group. Hospital admission for conges- 
tive heart failure occurred in one (0.2%) participant in the 
placebo group, two (0.5%) in the pioglitazone group and 
none in the rosiglitazone group. Fractures occurred in two 
(0.4%) participants in the placebo group, two (0.5%) in the 
pioglitazone group and three (0.8%) in the rosiglitazone 
group. Severe adverse events were reported in seven 
placebo participants, five pioglitazone participants and 
two rosiglitazone participants, and in the vitamin D arm, 
by two placebo participants and nine vitamin D partic- 
ipants. Serious adverse events, tabulated in ESM Table 2, 
included two cardiovascular, three respiratory, two gastro- 
intestinal, three genitourinary, one multi-organ failure, one 
pruritic allergic and two hypoglycaemic events. Each 
specific serious adverse event type occurred in only one 
person, except for hypoglycaemia which was reported in 
two participants. 

The purpose of the TIDE trial was to elucidate the effect of 
TZDs on cardiovascular events while also elucidating the 
effect of vitamin D on cancer and death in people with type 
2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. TIDE was 
designed to recruit 16,000 participants over 2 years and 
would have included 816 sites in 39 countries once all sites 
were activated. Based on the observed recruitment rates in 
early 2010, plans to add more sites, and ongoing support 
for continuation of the trial by the unblinded Independent 
Data Monitoring Committee, it is likely that recruitment 
would have rapidly increased until its completion in mid 
2011. However, the heated political debate, global coverage 
and public controversy surrounding both the trial and 
rosiglitazone attenuated recruitment and led to random- 
isation of only 1,332 of the planned 16,000 participants by 
the time recruitment was stopped. Eight of these 1,332 
suffered the composite primary outcome during a mean 
follow-up period of just 0.4 years of receiving TZD study 
drug—a number from which no conclusions can be drawn. 
The TZDs both reduced HbA1c and ALT levels and 
increased weight, whereas pioglitazone but not rosiglita- 
zone modestly reduced triacylglycerol and raised HDL- 
cholesterol levels compared with placebo. 
Uncertainty will persist regarding clinically relevant 
risks and benefits of either rosiglitazone or pioglitazone. 
Indeed, clinical equipoise regarding the cardiovascular 
effects of the TZDs prompted the American Heart Associ- 
ation and the American College of Cardiology to advocate 
jointly the conduct of definitive cardiovascular outcomes 
trials such as TIDE as recently as 2010 [22]. Such trials are

For glucose-lowering medication use, denominators are the 1,249 TZD arm participants and the 1,175 vitamin D arm participants who provided 
medication data at the final visit 
**p<0.01 and ***p<0.001 for placebo vs TZDs (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone groups combined); †p<0.05, ††p<0.01 and †††p<0.001 for 
pioglitazone vs rosiglitazone 

those that are large and continue for long enough to 
generate reliable results by accruing more than 1,000 
primary outcomes [45–47]. Without such trials, some 
therapies that are now known to be harmful would have 
been promoted because they were considered to be 
beneficial based on weaker evidence (e.g. suppression of 
ventricular premature beats after a myocardial infarction 
[48]) whereas other therapies that are now known to be 
beneficial would have been abandoned because they were 
considered to be harmful based on weaker evidence (e.g. 
lowering of systolic blood pressure in the elderly [49] and 
beta-blockers in heart failure [50]). 
As with the TZDs, no conclusion regarding the 
effects of vitamin D on cancers and mortality can be 
drawn. Previous randomised trials were not designed to 
assess extra-skeletal effects, or used doses of vitamin D 
that were likely inadequate to promote extra-skeletal 
effects [37, 39]. Nevertheless, these data and data from 
physiological studies have been used to actively promote 
its use for such indications. An ongoing trial of 20,000 
people (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01169259) 
is likely to 
resolve this uncertainty. 

The strengths of TIDE were its placebo-controlled 
design, 
inclusion of a research question 
regarding vitamin D in addition to the TZD questions, 
safety oversight by an independent data monitoring 
committee and independent scientific leadership. Its main 
weakness was its timing. Had it been initiated earlier it is 
likely that 
its results would have pre-empted premature 
conclusions and claims by various organisations and 


individuals regarding the efficacy and safety of rosiglita-

provided clear evidence to inform medical care. The history 
of TIDE therefore highlights the importance of conducting 
well-designed outcomes trials such as TIDE early in the 
lifecycle of drugs that are likely to be used for the ongoing 
treatment of chronic diseases such as diabetes.
