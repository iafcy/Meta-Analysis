Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the influence of calcium and vitamin D supplementation 
on PTH and bone turnover. 
Setting, Patients, and Design: At an ambulatory research center, 159 postmenopausal healthy 
white women participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel, longitudinal factorial 
study that was 6 months in duration. 
Interventions: Subjects were randomly allocated to 4 groups: 1) double placebo, 2) calcium (1200 
mg daily) plus placebo, 3) vitamin D3 (100 (cid:1)g) plus placebo, and 4) vitamin D3 and calcium. Serum 
and urine were collected fasting and 2 hours after a calcium load at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. 
Main Outcome Measures: Serum PTH, cross-linked C-telopeptide (CTX), and procollagen type I 
N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) were measured. 
Results: Before study medication, a calcium load resulted in a decline in PTH and CTX and an increase 
in urinary calcium excretion. Serum CTX and P1NP declined over time with calcium supplementation 
but did not change with increased vitamin D intake. There was a decline in PTH in the vitamin D groups 
in the fasting state compared with placebo. Suppression of PTH was greater after a calcium load in the 
vitamin D groups. A calcium load decreased PTH and CTX and raised urinary calcium. 
Conclusions: Fasting PTH declines with vitamin D supplementation. PTH declines after calcium 
intake. Supplementation of the diet with 1200 mg calcium/d reduces bone turnover markers, 
whereas supplementation with up to100 (cid:1)g vitamin D3/d does not. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 
E1702–E1709, 2013) 

etary reference intakes for calcium and vitamin D 
recommended a calcium intake of 1200 mg/d for those 
over 50 years old with a tolerable upper limit (UL) of 2000 
mg/d (1–3). Vitamin D intake of 600 IU/d from age 50 to 
70, and 800 IU/d over 71 years for the recommended daily 
allowance (RDA) with an upper limit of 4000 IU/d was 
recommended. These dietary reference intakes have been 
challenged in an Endocrine Society Clinical Guideline that 
implied that vitamin D intake should be substantially 
higher in much of the population (1500 –2000 IU for the 
RDA and 10,000 IU for the UL) (4). Both conclusions were 
based on the indicator bone health, a composite of factors 
including fracture prevention, bone loss, and osteomala- 
cia. Other nonskeletal indicators of vitamin D sufficiency 
have been proposed, but neither the IOM nor the Endo- 
crine Society found sufficient evidence that informed the 
formulation of an RDA for vitamin D using these putative 
biomarkers (1, 2, 4, 5). 
Clinical trials of fracture prevention confirm a benefi- 
cial effect of calcium with vitamin D supplementation in 
combination (6). However, it is difficult to discern the

separate contributions of these nutrients. In a previous 
study, we examined the influence of calcium intake and 
vitamin D separately as well as their interaction on bio- 
markers of skeletal nutritional sufficiency, ie, serum PTH 
and bone turnover markers (7). Because vitamin D enables 
calcium absorption, studies were also performed after a 
calcium load to examine the influence of calcium and vi- 
tamin D supplementation in the postabsorptive state. Cal- 
cium supplementation was found to lower bone turnover 
markers, but supplementation with 4000 IU vitamin D 
daily had no effect on bone turnover or PTH levels. 
Several weaknesses in this previous study were recog- 
nized. The study population was not uniform in gender, eth- 
nicity, or age, and the study duration was only 3 months. As 
a result of these limitations, we decided to repeat this study 
in a more uniform population of postmenopausal white 
women with a larger sample size and greater study duration. 
Our goal was to reexamine the influence of calcium and/or 
vitamin D supplementation on bone turnover and PTH levels 
in the fasting and postprandial states. 

A total of 363 healthy postmenopausal white participants were 
recruited from Winthrop University Hospital and its surround- 
ing area (Figure 1). Participation in this trial began in December 
2008 and ended in April 2011. Recruitment was carried out 
during winter in consecutive years through e-mail, advertise- 
ments in the local paper, and a direct mail campaign. Subjects 
were enrolled in two consecutive winters. Exclusion criteria in- 

cluded any chronic medical illness, osteoporosis, pregnancy, use 
of medications that influence bone metabolism or interfere with 
vitamin D metabolism, and unexplained weight loss during the 
previous year. Participants agreed to refrain from increasing di- 
etary calcium intake or from taking self-prescribed calcium or 
vitamin D supplements during the study. 
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of 
Winthrop University Hospital. All participants gave written con- 
sent before participation in any study-related activity. All par- 
ticipants and investigators were blinded to allocation through- 
out the study except for the research pharmacist and the 
statistical group. A total of 159 subjects qualified and consented 
to the study. 
Subjects had a baseline screening visit followed by an initial 
randomization visit and then visits 15 and 28 weeks later. A 
complete medical history and physical examination was done. A 
3-day dietary questionnaire was filled out by participants to as- 
sess daily calcium and vitamin D intake. Body weight and height 
(using a Harpenden stadiometer) were recorded. Baseline fasting 
laboratory tests included serum calcium, phosphorus, serum 25- 
hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 
(1,25(OH)2D), serum PTH, serum cross-linked C-telopeptide 
(CTX), serum procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), 
and fasting urine calcium and creatinine (8, 9). After collecting 
fasting blood and urine samples, participants were given a 600-mg 
calcium tablet in the form of calcium carbonate with a light break- 
fast to eat. Breakfast consisted of tea or coffee with a small amount 
of milk and two slices of white bread (40 mg of calcium per slice) 
with butter. Two hours after the oral calcium load, serum calcium, 
1,25(OH)2D, PTH, CTX, and P1NP and urine calcium/creatinine 
(Ca/Cr) were again measured. The fasting and calcium load studies 
described above were repeated at each visit. 
At the second baseline visit, 159 participants who qualified for the 
study were assigned to 1 of 4 groups by a simple randomization: 1) 
placebo vitamin D3 supplement and active calcium supplement, 2) 
active vitamin D3 supplement and placebo 
calcium supplement, 3) both active vitamin 
D3 and active calcium supplements, and 4) 
both placebo vitamin D3 and placebo cal- 
cium supplements. All subjects took one 
600-mg tablet of calcium (or placebo) in the 
morning and in the evening for a dose of 
1200 mg daily (or no calcium). Vitamin D3 
supplements were administered in 50-(cid:1)g 
capsules. All subjects took one dose of vita- 
min D3 (or placebo) in the morning and one 
in the evening for a dose of 100 (cid:1)g (4000 IU) 
daily (or no vitamin D). In this double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel-group, longitu- 
dinal factorial design, patients and research- 
ers were blinded to group assignment. The 
trial was recorded with www.Clinical 
Trials.gov at http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ 
show/NCT00762775?term_nct0076775& 
rank_1. 
Medications were provided in vials 
containing enough doses for 12 weeks. 
The active and placebo calcium supple- 
ments and the active and placebo vitamin 
D supplements had identical appearance 
and weights. The compositions of the 
placebos were inert materials. Any con-

a Reference laboratory ranges are as follows: PTH, 17–72 pg/mL; P1NP, 16 –96 (cid:1)g/L; CTX, 0.142–1.351 ng/mL; 1,25(OH)2D, 39 –193 pmol/L; 
25(OH)D, 50 –125 nmol/L; urinary Ca/Cr, (cid:1)0.37. 
comitant medications or adverse events were recorded. At 
4-week intervals, subjects were contacted to encourage compli- 
ance and record any adverse events. Participants returned for 
visits after 15 and 28 weeks. The 3-day dietary record was col- 
lected along with the remaining pills. A pill count was done as a 
means of measuring compliance. Vital signs, height, weight, and 
travel history were collected. Any concomitant medications and 
adverse events were recorded. Fasting serum calcium, serum 
25(OH)D, serum PTH, serum CTX, and serum P1NP were col- 
lected. Fasting urine samples were analyzed for calcium and cre- 
atinine. Participants were given a 600-mg calcium tablet (cal- 
cium carbonate) again accompanied by a light breakfast. After 2 
hours, postprandial blood and urine samples were collected. All 
unused study medication was collected and counted to evaluate 
for compliance. Vitamin D3 capsules were custom manufactured 
by Tishcon Corp, and their content was verified in an indepen- 
dent laboratory (Vitamin D, Skin, and Bone Research Labora- 
tory, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Med- 
icine, Boston, Massachusetts). 

Serum 25(OH)D was measured by an 
RIA from DiaSorin, Inc. The minimum 
and maximum detectable levels are 3.75 
and 250 nmol/L, respectively. The intra- 
assay precision (coefficient of variation) 
for the mean of 21.5 nmol/L is 11.7% 
and for the mean of 122.5 nmol/L is 
12.5%. The overall intra-assay variabil- 
ity in our laboratory is 4.1%, and inter- 
assay variability is 7.0%. Our laboratory 
participates in and has been certified con- 
tinuously since 2005 by the Vitamin D 
External Quality Assessment Scheme, an 
external quality control program (10). 
The reference range for serum 25(OH)D 
is 50 to 125 nmol/L. Serum and urinary 
calcium were measured by O-cresol- 
phthalein complex using automated 
equipment Dimension-RXL (Dade Beh- 
ring). Urinary creatinine was measured 
by Jaffe reaction with automated instru- 
mentation Dimension-RXL. Serum PTH 
was measured by the Immulite 2000 an- 
alyzer for the quantitative measurement 
of 
intact PTH (Diagnostic Products 
Corp). Serum CTX was measured by the 
Serum Crosslaps ELISA kit made by 
Nordic Bioscience Diagnostics. Serum 
P1NP was measured using the UniQ 
P1NP RIA kit from Orion Diagnostica. 
Serum CTX provides a measure of bone 
resorption, and P1NP is a marker of type 
I collagen synthesis. Serum 1,25(OH)2D

concentrations were measured by an ELISA kit made by Immu- 
nodiagnostic Systems. The inter- and intra-assay variability in 
our laboratory is 17% and 10%, respectively, The reference 
range for this assay is 39 to 193 pmol/L. 

Total daily calcium and vitamin D intake was estimated from 
a 3-day diet history using Nutrition Pro nutrition analysis soft- 
ware (11). 

The study consisted of 159 subjects at baseline with obser- 
vations collected at 3 time points (baseline and 15 and 28 weeks). 
Simple randomization was performed at baseline using a com- 
puter-generated randomization list, and subjects were assigned 
to 1 of the 4 groups, namely placebo, vitamin D alone, calcium 
alone, and vitamin D plus calcium. All enrollments occurred in 
winter. The number of subjects varied at each time point due to 
dropouts. A total of 120 subjects completed the study. 
Descriptive statistics are reported as mean (SD). A repeated- 
measures mixed-effect model (SAS Proc GLIMMIX) was used 
for all primary analysis where time, calcium, and vitamin D were 
taken as fixed effects. The mixed-effect model under the assump- 
tion of ignorability (12) allowed us to include all subjects even 
with the missing data at any time point, thus keeping intact the 
intent-to-treat principle. We considered both 2-way and 3-way 
interaction terms between time, calcium, and vitamin D. A sub- 
ject-specific random slope was also included in the model, and 
unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used throughout. 
In each analysis, we were interested to find the significance of the 
interaction term between calcium and vitamin D with time. A 
post hoc power analysis revealed that our baseline sample size 
was large enough to detect this 2-way fixed-effect interaction 
with sufficient power ((cid:2)80%) but was not sufficient ((cid:1)80%) to 
detect a 3-way interaction between time, calcium, and vitamin D. 
Consistent with the previous study by our group (7), we calcu- 
lated this power for a moderate effect size as described in Cohen 
(13). The significance of each term (interaction and main effects) 
is reported via a traditional F test obtained from a mixed-effect 
ANOVA using SAS software version 9.2. A two-tailed P value (cid:1) 
.05 was used to determine significance, and (cid:2)(type-1 error) was 
kept fixed at 0.05. No statistical correction of P value is reported 
for multiple comparisons because this has an inflationary effect 
on the P value (11). Hence, finding a P value close to a .05 
threshold should be taken as exploratory in nature and requires 
confirmation with a larger study. 


There were no significant differences between the study 
groups in age, BMI, or dietary intake of calcium (Table 1). 
There were also no significant differences in baseline lab- 
oratory values. Mean dietary calcium intake was less 
than the recommended intake of the IOM, and mean se- 
rum 25(OH)D was above the RDA-associated serum 
25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L but below The En- 
docrine Society’s recommended value of 70 to 80 nmol/L. 
There were no significant group differences in dietary cal- 
cium throughout this study. 
The distribution of baseline fasting PTH was as fol- 
lows: (cid:2)65 pg/mL, n (cid:3) 6. The baseline 25(OH)D distri- 
bution was as follows: (cid:1)50 nmol/L, n (cid:3) 35; (cid:2)50 nmol/L 
and less than 75 nmol/L, n (cid:3) 73. Four subjects had serum 
25(OH)D (cid:1)50 nmol/L and PTH (cid:2)65 pg/mL. Serum fast- 
ing CTX and P1NP were above the reference range in 24 
and 17 participants, respectively. 


Influence 2 hours after a calcium load before 
intervention (n (cid:1) 159) 
The influence of the calcium load performed on all sub- 
jects (n (cid:3) 159) before intervention may be seen in Figure 
2. There was no change in serum creatinine or 25(OH)D, 
as expected. Serum calcium increased slightly (P (cid:1) .0001) 
accompanied by a decline in serum PTH (P (cid:1) .0001). 
Serum CTX and P1NP declined significantly, and there 
was a significant increase in urine calcium. 
Values after intervention assignment in the 4 
groups in the fasting state 
Data are presented in Table 2. There were no significant 
interaction terms (time (cid:4) vitamin D and time (cid:4) calcium) 
in the fasting state for serum creatinine or calcium and for 
urine Ca/Cr. There was a significant decline in bone turn- 
over markers for calcium supplementation: P1NP (P (cid:1) 
.002) and CTX (P (cid:1) .001), but no interaction was ob- 
served for the vitamin D interventions. Findings were sim- 
ilar when baseline PTH or the bone turnover markers were 
used as covariates. There was a significant decline (P (cid:1) 
.03) in serum 1,25(OH)2D for the calcium but not the 
vitamin D intervention. 
Fasting serum PTH trended downward for the vitamin 
D intervention (P (cid:3) .075) and for the calcium intervention 
(P (cid:3) .096). The variability in the fasting serum PTH values 
was notable. Because of the significant correlation be- 
tween baseline and subsequent values of PTH, baseline 
adjusted analysis of PTH was performed (Figure 3). In this 
analysis, there was a significant decline in PTH over time 
as captured by the interaction between time and vitamin D 
(cid:3) 4.07, P (cid:3) .046) and a nonsignificant decline in 
(F1,113 
(cid:3) 2.26, P (cid:3) .13) groups. The slope of 
the calcium (F1,113 
change of PTH over time was significant for the combined 
treatment group (P (cid:1) .0003). A separate analysis of PTH 
was also done comparing individual groups with placebo 
alone. There were significant differences in the vitamin D 
(P (cid:1) .05) and combined groups (P (cid:3) .02) and a trend with 
the calcium group (P (cid:3) .07).

a Results are shown as mean (SD). Reference laboratory ranges are as follows: urine Ca/Cr, (cid:1)0.37; serum Ca, 9.1–10.4 mg/dL; 1,25(OH)2D, 
39 –193 pmol/L; P1NP, 16 –96 (cid:1)g/L; CTX, 0.142–1.351 ng/mL; PTH, 14 –72 pg/mL. P values reported are for second-order interaction terms. 
b P values for time (cid:4) vitamin D interaction effect. 
c P values for time (cid:4) calcium interaction effect. 
Values after intervention in the 4 groups after a 
calcium load 
Response to the oral calcium load for each relevant 
parameter is also given in Table 2. Again, as expected, 
there was no change in fasting creatinine or serum calcium. 
Calcium intervention resulted in declines after ingestion of 
a calcium load for PTH, (P (cid:1) .038), P1NP (P (cid:1) .002), and 
CTX (P (cid:1) .003). Serum PTH declined from the fasting 
levels in the vitamin D intervention (P (cid:3) .038). During 
supplementation, the decline in PTH after a calcium load 
was higher in both vitamin D treatment groups (for com- 
bined P (cid:3) .03). The placebo and calcium-alone groups did 
not differ significantly from the fasting results. 

The response of serum 25(OH)D in the vitamin D-sup- 
plemented groups is depicted in Supplemental Figure 1 
(published on The Endocrine Society’s Journals Online 
Figure 3. Groupwise mean plot of 4 groups for response 
to fasting PTH after baseline adjustment. A mixed-effects model 
revealed that the interaction term time (cid:4) vitamin D was significant 
(F1,113

sponse is curvilinear. In the fasting state, the calcium in- 
take group experienced a significant decline in calcitriol 
(cid:3) 4.74, P (cid:3) .03). A similar response was 
over time (F1,259 
seen in the calcium-loaded state, with an even lower P 
(cid:3) 11.26, P (cid:1) .001), suggesting a larger effect

showed a trend toward increase (Supplemental Figure 2). 

Compliance (pill count) was 78% for vitamin D and 
78% for calcium. There were no differences in compliance 
for any group. There were no serious adverse events in the 
study. Reported adverse events are given in Table 3 using 
a scheme similar to MedDRA. The patients who dropped 
out because of adverse events were as follows: placebo 
group, 1 for flank pain; vitamin D group, 1 for a sprained 
ankle and 1 for arthralgia; calcium plus vitamin D group, 
1 for constipation, 1 for upset stomach, 1 for palpitations 
and headaches; and calcium group, 1 for upset stomach 
and 1 for leg cramps and weakness. No change in mean 
serum calcium or phosphate was seen in the fasting state. 
One incident of transient hypercalcemia was noted in the 
calcium plus vitamin D group. 
Using 0.23 for the upper limit for the urine Ca/Cr ratio 
in the fasting state during the intervention periods, the 
frequency of values exceeding this concentration was 
highest in the combined treatment group (10 instances, 
compared with 1–2 in the other groups). Using the less 
sensitive value for defining hypercalciuria of a Ca/Cr 
greater than 0.37, there was only 1 episode of hypercal-

ciuria in each group. No adverse events were believed to be 
related to supplementation other than hypercalciuria. 

This study provides insight into the response to dietary 
supplementation with calcium and/or vitamin D. Before 
group assignment, a calcium load resulted in significant 
declines in PTH and bone turnover markers (CTX and 
P1NP) and an increase in urinary calcium excretion. The 
increase in urinary calcium excretion presumably reflects 
the calcium load that is not used. These responses are likely 
seen after each ingestion of a calcium supplement (or cal- 
cium-rich meal) and result in a postprandial decrease in 
PTH and bone resorption. After long-term dietary sup- 
plementation, a decline in fasting PTH is observed with 
vitamin D supplementation, likely as a result of genomic 
effects of calcitriol on the parathyroid (14). Although cal- 
cium supplementation appropriately suppresses calcitriol 
levels with high vitamin D intake (in the absence of cal- 
cium supplementation), calcitriol levels do not decline 
from baseline even when a calcium load suppresses PTH. 
Calcium loading is more effective in suppressing PTH in 
the presence of vitamin D supplementation. 
These findings are consistent with our previous study 
that was not age-, race-, or gender-specific and found that 
calcium supplementation reduced bone turnover markers 
but vitamin D supplementation did not (7). This finding is 
consistent with a recent food fortification study with a 
similar design and other studies as well (15). 
The decline in PTH under high-calcium/high-25(OH)D 
conditions may represent a pharmacologic effect. Sai et 
al (14) noted that serum PTH declines continuously up 
to 150 nmol/L. They propose that this decline may be 
the result of pharmacologic effects of higher serum 
25(OH)D or calcitriol on the vitamin D response ele- 
ment in the PTH gene (14). In concert with earlier stud- 
ies, we found that serum calcitriol concentration rises 
with increasing doses of vitamin D supplementation 
(see Supplemental Figure 2) (16). 
The mean baseline dietary calcium intake in the current 
study was over 900 mg/d, and baseline serum 25(OH)D 
was above 45 nmol/L, yet calcium supplementation did 
reduce bone turnover despite some studies that would not 
have predicted this (17, 18). Because this was not a dose- 
response study, we can only conclude that 1200 mg/d of 
calcium supplements is more effective in reducing bone 
turnover than an unsupplemented intake of 900 mg/d. The 
calcium intake in the current study was at the UL (2000 
mg/d) recommended by the IOM. The UL value was based 
on an increased risk of kidney stones observed in the cal- 
cium supplementation arm of the Women’s Health Initia- 
tive (19). 
In our previous study, bone turnover markers showed 
a trend to increase in the high vitamin D group (3). In the 
current, more homogeneous study, an increase in bone 
turnover was not observed in the high vitamin D group. 
Thus, with intakes of vitamin D at the current UL (4000 
IU/d), we found no evidence for adverse effects on bone 
health in terms of increased bone turnover. The risk of

increased bone turnover at the UL proposed by The En- 
docrine Society (10 000 IU/d) is unknown. 
We speculate that increasing calcium intake after the 
calcitriol-dependent process is saturated will result in tran- 
scellular transport and a decline in postabsorptive PTH 
levels. The decline in PTH after the calcium load at base- 
line in our study was notable. The effect of increased cal- 
cium intake can best be detected in the postabsorptive 
rather than the fasting state. The intermittent effect of 
calcium intake can be readily detected on the bone turn- 
over markers, indicating a sustained effect on bone turn- 
over. In contrast, vitamin D may have a genomic effect on 
PTH secretion but at high levels may act directly to in- 
crease bone remodeling, thereby counteracting any bene- 
ficial influence of PTH secretion on bone turnover (5). A 
recent study found that standard vitamin D therapy de- 
creased bone turnover to a greater extent than very high 
doses (the equivalent of 6500 IU/d) (15). 
There are several limitations of this study. A 24-hour 
measurement of PTH would have been preferable as 
would a larger sample size. There has been a great deal of 
discussion in recent years about the most accurate assay 
for serum 25(OH)D (20). However, our laboratory was 
certified by the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment 
Scheme when these analyses were performed and was 
within the all-laboratory trimmed mean (ALTM). Fur- 
thermore, this study was performed in subjects who had 
baseline serum 25(OH)D levels actually above the serum 
25(OH)D-linked RDA recommendations of the IOM. 
Nonetheless, the conditions of this study are similar to 
advice that may be given to women currently, and it is clear 
that increased calcium supplementation reduced bone 
turnover, whereas increasing serum 25(OH)D (above 50 
nmol/L) did not. 
Our study supports the benefit of high calcium intake 
in reducing bone turnover in postmenopausal white 
women. The placebo group had a mean daily calcium in- 
take of 946 mg. Bone turnover was significantly reduced 
by the addition of 1200 mg/d of calcium supplements and 
further reduced by a calcium load. Current recommenda- 
tions for nutritional intake of calcium heavily relied on 
calcium balance studies (1). It is unknown whether this 
effect would be sustained or whether it only reflects the 
remodeling transient, although it has been sustained in 
some studies (21–23). Moreover, it is unknown whether 
this is a pharmacologic effect and what the long-term 
safety of very high calcium intake may be (24). Our com- 
bined calcium/vitamin D group had more instances of hy- 
percalciuria. Hypercalciuria has been observed in other 
studies as well (5, 13, 16). Studies using a less sensitive 
definition of hypercalciuria (ie, 0.37 Ca/Cr) may not have 
noted its presence (25).
