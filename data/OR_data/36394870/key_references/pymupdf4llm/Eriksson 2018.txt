**Abstract**
**Purpose To compare acute ACL reconstruction (ACLR) within 8 days of injury with delayed reconstruction after normalized**
range of motion (ROM), 6–10 weeks after injury. It was hypothesized that acute ACL reconstruction with modern techniques
is safe and can be beneficial in terms of patient-reported outcomes and range of motion.
**Methods Sample size calculation indicated 64 patients would be required to find a 5° difference in ROM at 3 months. Seventy**
patients with high recreational activity level, Tegner level 6 or more, were randomized to acute (within 8 days) or delayed
(6–10 weeks) ACLR between 2006 and 2013. During the first 3 months following surgery patients were contacted weekly by
SMS and asked ‘How is your knee functioning?’, with answers given on a Visual-Analog Scale (0–10). ROM was assessed
after 3 months by the rehab physiotherapist. Patient-reported outcomes, objective IKDC and manual stability measurements
were collected by an independent physiotherapist not involved in the rehab at the 6-month follow-up.
**Results At 3-month follow-up, 91% of the patients were assessed with no significant differences in flexion, extension or**
total ROM demonstrated between groups. At the 6-month follow-up, the acute group had significantly less muscle atrophy
of the thigh muscle compared to the contralateral leg. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the acute
group passed or were close to passing the one leg hop test (47 versus 21%, p = 0.009). No difference was found between the
groups in the other clinical assessments. Additionally, no significant difference between the groups was found in terms of
associated injuries.
**Conclusion Acute ACLR within 8 days of injury does not appear to adversely affect ROM or result in increased stiffness in**
the knee joint when compared to delayed surgery.
**Level of evidence II.**

### Introduction

Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)
following an acute rupture is commonly recommended for
people wishing to return to pre-injury athletic activity [29].
In Sweden, the most common activity associated with an
acute ACL rupture is soccer [16]. The incidence of ACL
ruptures continues to increase, particularly amongst females

[16, 18]. Patients who undergo surgery are usually younger

and compete or train at a higher level than those treated
non-operatively [9]. Delayed surgical reconstruction is often
chosen instead of an acute reconstruction due to studies suggesting that this may reduce the risk of developing arthrofibrosis and decreased range of motion (ROM) postoperatively

[6, 28]. However, in these studies, patellar bone-tendon-bone
(BTB) was the preferred graft and semi-open surgical techniques were often utilized.
These techniques differ significantly from contemporary
methods, with recent data showing almost 95% of all primary ACL reconstructions in the Swedish ACL-register are
performed using a hamstring graft and purely arthroscopic
procedures with low pressure systems are now widely used

[16].
Despite these developments, early reconstruction in
the first weeks following ACL rupture is still commonly

avoided due to fear of postoperative stiffness, with many
adhering to the theory that surgery should be postponed
until swelling has subsided and the patient has regained
adequate ROM. Consequently, delayed reconstruction has
been recommended worldwide in clinical practice for more
than 20 years.
The timing of ACLR has been discussed by Wasilewski
et al. [32], and studied more recently by Bottoni et al. in a
randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACLR
with hamstring graft. In this study, no significant difference
in extension or flexion loss was demonstrated when comparing surgery within 21 days of injury compared to surgery
after 6 weeks [4].
Given these findings and the fact that motivated athletes
with an ACL injury commonly wish to avoid unnecessary
postponements to their surgery, there is a need for additional
level 1 evidence confirming the safety of early reconstructive
ACL surgery.
The primary aim of this study was to determine if young
active patients undergoing ACLR within 1 week of injury
had significantly reduced knee range of motion compared to
patients undergoing reconstruction after a delay of approximately 2 months, when initial swelling and stiffness had subsided. The secondary aim was to compare early functional
outcomes between the groups. It was hypothesized that an
acute ACLR results in inferior patient-reported outcomes
and a greater incidence of ROM deficits.

### Materials and methods

From 2006 to 2013, 2088 patients who had presented to the
emergency department with an acute knee injury were followed up within 3 days at a knee clinic. Clinical examination
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. If
an ACL-rupture was diagnosed and the patient consented to
participation, they were assessed for inclusion in the study.
The inclusion criteria were selected to recruit patients
with a high demand for pivoting stability, thus with an obvious need for ACLR, and to exclude patients with factors
that would make it difficult to follow a standardized surgical method and postoperative rehab-protocol. The inclusion
criteria were: uni-lateral primary ACL-injury in patients
between 18 and 40 years of age with no previous kneeinjury to either leg, Tegner activity level score [31] minimum level 6, no additional meniscus or cartilage damage on
MRI indicating the need for major acute meniscus or cartilage surgery, availability for reconstruction within 8 days of
injury, no LCL-injury that needed surgery, no MCL-injury
greater than grade 1, no PCL-insufficiency and no signs of
osteoarthritis.
If all the pre-requisites were fulfilled, a research nurse
performed randomization with the sealed envelope technique

in the same session. Seventy patients were included, 35
patients were randomized to early ACLR and 35 patients
to late reconstruction. One patient from the acute group
dropped out before surgery due to personal reasons, a second
exclusion was needed because one patient could not participate in follow-up according to the study protocol (Fig. 1).
Patient demographics are presented in Table 1. The patients
were prospectively randomized to reconstruction of the ACL
either within 8 days of injury, or with delayed reconstruction after recovery of range of motion (ROM), between 6
and 10 weeks after the injury. The patients randomized to
delayed surgery received pre-operative physiotherapy to
restore normal range of movement and to preserve muscle
strength.

#### Pre‑operative assessments

At the time of inclusion and randomization, the patients
were evaluated regarding ROM (passive ROM measured
with a goniometer and reported as a deficit in extension and
flexion), instrumented laxity using the Rolimeter [2] and
thigh-circumference measured 10 cm proximal to the proximal pole of the patella. Subjective and self-assessed IKDC

[10], KOOS [25], Lysholm and Tegner scores [31] were also
evaluated.
In all clinical tests, the contralateral non-injured side was
used as a reference.

#### Surgical method

In each patient, an arthroscopic ACLR with autologous
quadrupled semitendinosus tendon graft, or quadrupled
semitendinosus- and gracilis tendon-graft if the graft was
not of the defined sufficient length (minimum quadrupled
graft length in this study: 6.5 cm). In the beginning of the
study the tibia was drilled first and transtibial drilling of
the femur was used. The tibial angle was 45°–50° as to
the surgeon’s preferences. A femur entry point at 10 or 2
o’clock was preferred with a knee angle of 80–90 degrees
of flexion; an offset guide of 5–7 mm was routinely used.
Later on in the study due to the evolution of surgical technique at the time, we changed method for tunnel placement.
Footprint positioning was used, with drilling of the femoral
tunnel through an accessory medial portal, aiming for the
center of the femoral footprint. The first technique included
22 patients and the last 47 patients. Fixation was standardized during the whole study period, Endobutton continuous ­loop[®] (Smith & Nephew, Inc., Andover, MA 01810,
USA) was used in femur and tibial fixation was performed
with a metal interference-screw, ­RCI[®] (Smith & Nephew,
Inc., Andover, MA 01810, USA) or Soft ­Screw[®] (Arthrex
Inc., Naples, Florida 34108, USA). The distal fixation was
reinforced with an osteo-suture over a “bone-bridge”. Distal

fixation was performed in 90-degree flexion of the knee joint
with subsequent testing to ensure that full extension could
be attained.
For infection-prophylaxis, one intravenous dose of antibiotics (flucloxacillin) was given just prior to surgery and two
extra doses after 3 and 6 h.

#### Postoperative management

Full weight bearing was allowed from day 1. Antithrombotic
prophylaxis with 5000 U of low molecular weight heparin
was given once daily for 7 days after surgery. A brace was
only used for patients who required suturing of menisci, 3
in the acute group and 1 in the delayed group. The brace
had a fixed ROM 0°–60° for 4 weeks and 0–90 for another
2 weeks, full weight-bearing was permitted with the support
of crutches during the first 3 weeks. Closed-chain exercises
and range of motion training was initiated within 1 week of
surgery. The rehabilitation was standardized to one physiotherapy- center, and the same rehabilitation protocol was
used for all patients. Open-chain exercises were allowed
after 6 weeks, running allowed after 14 weeks and resumption of sport activity after ­Biodex[®] testing showed 90%


strength in injured leg compared to the contralateral leg,
but never earlier than 6 months.

#### Postoperative follow‑up

At 3 months ROM and circumference of the thighs were
assessed by the patient’s physiotherapist. An independent
physiotherapist not involved in the rehabilitation performed
the same assessments at 6, 12 and 24 months.
Follow-up at 6, 12 and 24 months included the same subjective scores as preoperatively as well as functional strength
test assessed with the single leg hop. Isokinetic peak torque
strength at 60, 180 and 240°/s, and isometric torque strength
at 60° and 180°, in both extension and flexion was measured
with ­Biodex[®] [30].
Follow-up included a weekly assessment to the question:
“How is your knee functioning?” Answers were given on a
Visual-Analog Scale (VAS) 0–10 via short message service
(SMS) for the first 3 months. The question was also assessed
at baseline and at 6 months together with the question “How
does your knee affect your activity level?”.
The study was approved by the regional ethics committee
at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Sweden (reference no.
2006/404-31/3/2008/1541-32).

### Results


Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS
22.0 software package for Macintosh. Nominal variables
were tested by the χ[2] test or the Fisher’s exact test. Ordinal
variables and non-normality distributed interval and scale
variables were evaluated by the Mann–Whitney U test, and
the Student’s t test was used for normally distributed scale
variables in independent groups. Longitudinal statistics
were done with the paired-samples t test for normally distributed scale variables and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test
for ordinal and non-normality distributed scale variables.
The tests were two-sided. The results were considered significant at p < 0.05.
A sample size calculation was performed using the primary outcome variable ROM. If the mean difference is 5°
or more (corresponding to means of 122.5 versus 117.5)
and the common within-group standard deviation is 7.0.
The study will have a power of 80% to yield a statistically
significant result with 5% risk of a type-one error, with the
proposed sample size of 32 patients for the two groups.

Demographic data of the study groups are displayed
in Table 2. The only significant difference between the
groups was the time between injury and reconstruction.
Two patients, one in each group, were lost to follow-up at
6 months. It is also notable that mean surgery time in the
acute group was longer, but not statistically significant.
Sixty-four patients (91%) were assessed by a non-blinded
physiotherapist at 3 months. No difference in flexion, extension or total ROM between the groups was found (Table 3).
Similar ROM between the groups was found at 6 months
measured at the hospital unit (Table 3).
Similar results were found in both groups for the weekly
SMS question (Fig. 2) Fewer patients in the acute group
reported having their activity level affected by symptoms
from their knee (Table 4). Both groups had improved Tegner
and Lysholm scores from inclusion to the 6-month followup (Table 4).
After the injury, the acute group were less affected in
the KOOS subscales ‘pain’ and ‘quality of life’. After

6 months, the KOOS was similar in the groups, but with
better improvement within the subscales ‘pain’, ‘symptoms’
and ‘quality of life’ for the acute group (Fig. 3).
The overall objective, IKDC as well as manual laxity
measurements using pivot shift and rolimeter did not display
any statistically significant differences (Table 4).
There was less muscle atrophy and more patients with
a normal one leg hop test in the acute group (Table 4).


However, no differences between the groups in peak torque
was found during the ­Biodex[®] test (Table 4).
With a cutoff for return to sport at 90% or more strength
in the reconstructed limb compared to the contralateral limb
in extension and flexion at 60°/s, 4 of 33 acute and 2 of 34
delayed patients were cleared at 6 months.

### Discussion

The most important finding of this randomized control trial
is that at 6-month follow-up there were no significant differences in ROM between patients who underwent acute ACLR
compared to patients undergoing delayed surgery. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in most of the
subjective outcome scores measured at 6-month follow-up.
This finding challenges the current “state of the art” regarding timing of ACLR, that acute reconstruction should be
avoided due to increased risk of stiffness.
The landmark study by Shelbourne et al [28] is the primary source for the recommendation to delay ACLR by at
least 3 weeks. Other studies have found similar results [23,
32], however, these studies were retrospective, included
patients with additional ligament injuries and did not use
contemporary arthroscopic techniques. Importantly, these
studies also had a restrictive postoperative rehabilitation
regime. Shelbourne et al [26, 27] reported significantly less
arthrofibrosis when an accelerated rehabilitation program
was used.
Mayr et al [20] retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 156
patients with post-operative arthrofibrosis and found significant correlations between knee irritation, effusion and swelling and development of arthrofibrosis, rather than the time
from injury to surgery. The rationale for acute reconstruction
is that if the surgery is performed within the first few days
after the injury, the surgical trauma itself will blend into
the trauma from the injury. In contrast, a slightly delayed
operation when healing is already underway may result in a
second hit, due to surgical trauma, resulting in an increased
risk for arthrofibrosis. In our study, acute reconstruction did
not result in increased stiffness. The acute group had better
one leg hop tests, better improvements within the subscales
pain, symptoms and quality of life in KOOS, and better outcomes regarding how the knee affected their activity level
at 6 months. Additionally, the acute group was not inferior
to the delayed group in any assessment. These findings are
supported by the systematic review by Andernord et al [1].
The timing of surgery may also affect other important
outcomes such as; occurrence of additional injuries (predominantly cartilage and meniscus), development of muscle wasting, final outcome after surgical treatment, time
between injury and return to play as well as patient satisfaction. In a study from 1995, early reconstruction with

time-point

patellar tendon graft, or fascia lata graft, was compared
to delayed reconstruction. Patients with an early reconstruction returned to sports activities sooner and had better
clinical results [19].
Meighan et al. reported that there was no advantage in
early reconstruction within 2 weeks of the injury, and a
higher rate of complications [21]. However, more recent
studies support early reconstruction. Bottoni et al. reported
excellent results after reconstruction within 3 weeks of
injury, with no subjective or clinical differences in ROM.
Their results are more in line with the findings in the present
study [4]. Herbst et al. compared acute ACLR within 48 h
after injury with delayed reconstruction and stated that the
outcome of an ACLR does not depend on surgical timing

[11]. In addition, the likelihood of normalized knee kinematics has been shown to correlate with time between injury and
reconstruction [12–14].
Other studies have examined whether surgery should be
delayed to see if a patient can successfully be managed conservatively. Frobell et al. [7, 8] concluded that early reconstruction was not superior to initial nonsurgical treatment
with optional delayed reconstruction, however at 5-year follow-up 51% in the nonsurgical group had undergone delayed
reconstruction. The odds of having a meniscus lesion significantly increase, as the time between injury to surgery
increase [5, 22] and there are reports of a higher prevalence
of OA with longer time between injury and reconstruction

[15, 17]. This raises the question of whether initial nonsurgical treatment in patients with a high pre-injury activity level
is an acceptable option. We did not find any significant difference between the groups in terms of associated injuries;
a finding supported by other studies [4, 21, 24], though differences in the development of associated injuries have been
seen in larger cohorts [3]. It is possible that no difference
was detected in our study due to the smaller cohort size, or

## 1 3


due to the difference in time-to-surgery between the groups
being too small to influence additional injury outcomes.
The major strength of this study is the prospective, randomized design with four experienced surgeons performing all of the ACLRs with the same surgical technique.
Furthermore, one center with the same postoperative
rehabilitation protocol was used in both groups. The two
groups were also comparable in terms of age, gender and
pre-injury Tegner activity lever, factors which could contribute to selection bias in a non-randomized trial.
Potential limitations are the limited number of patients,
though there were sufficient numbers according to the
power analysis, and the change in surgical method during
the study period (transtibial versus femoral portal drilling).

### Conclusion

In this study, acute ACLR within 8 days did not result in
reduced ROM compared to delayed surgery. The patients
who underwent acute reconstruction had significantly less
muscle hypotrophy in the early phase of the rehabilitation
and significantly better one leg hop test. No difference
was found between the groups in the other clinical assessments. This study provides further evidence that acute
ACL reconstruction can be performed safely without an
increased risk of developing stiffness. Thus, clinicians can
make their decision about the optimal time for surgery
for each individual patient based on other parameters if
reconstruction is planned as the primary treatment after
an acute injury.
