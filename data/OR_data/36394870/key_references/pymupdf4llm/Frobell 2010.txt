**BACKGROUND**
The optimal management of a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee is
unknown.

**METHODS**
We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving 121 young, active adults
with acute ACL injury in which we compared two strategies: structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and structured rehabilitation with the option of
later ACL reconstruction if needed. The primary outcome was the change from
baseline to 2 years in the average score on four subscales of the Knee Injury and
Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) — pain, symptoms, function in sports and
recreation, and knee-related quality of life (KOOS4; range of scores, 0 [worst] to 100

[best]). Secondary outcomes included results on all five KOOS subscales, the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and the score on the Tegner
Activity Scale.

**RESULTS**
Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not
undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent rehabilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS4 score from baseline to
2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed reconstruction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95% confidence interval,
−6.5 to 6.8; P = 0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary outcomes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when
the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received.

**CONCLUSIONS**
In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early
ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional
delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency
of surgical reconstructions. (Funded by the Swedish Research Council and the

upture of the anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) is a serious knee injury
that affects mainly physically active young
people. The injury is characterized by joint insta-R
bility that leads to decreased activity, unsatisfactory knee function, and poor knee-related quality
of life in the short term,[1,2] and it is associated with
an increased risk of osteoarthritis of the knee.[3]

Surgical reconstruction of the torn ligament
has been regarded as critical for a good outcome
and is commonly performed, particularly in those
wishing to resume sports activities.[2,4,5] Despite a
lack of evidence from high-quality randomized,
controlled trials comparing ACL reconstruction
with other treatments,[2,3,6-8] at least 200,000 ACL
reconstructions are performed each year in the
United States, with estimated direct costs of
$3 billion (in U.S. dollars) annually.[9] Structured
rehabilitation supervised by a physical therapist
is a central aspect of treatment,[10] although it is
not always offered to patients.
We conducted a randomized, controlled trial
involving young, active adults with an acute tear
of the ACL to determine whether a strategy of
structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstructive surgery is superior to a strategy of structured rehabilitation with delayed ACL reconstruction offered to subjects who continue to have
symptomatic knee instability.


Methods


**Study Design and Participants**
We conducted the trial (the Knee Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Nonsurgical versus Surgical Treatment [KANON] Study) in Lund, Sweden, with
subjects recruited from the Department of Orthopedics at both Helsingborg Hospital and Lund
University Hospital. Details of the recruitment
have been reported previously.[11] The protocol was
approved by the Lund University ethics committee. The study was performed in accordance with
the protocol, and all subjects provided written
informed consent.
Subjects 18 to 35 years of age who presented
to the emergency department with recent knee
trauma were screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects had rotational trauma to a previously uninjured knee within the preceding 4 weeks, ACL
insufficiency as determined by clinical examination, and a score of 5 to 9 on the Tegner Activity
Scale (TAS)[12] before the injury (scores range from
1 to 10, with a score of 5 indicating participation


in recreational sports, and a score of 9 indicating
participation in competitive sports on a nonprofessional level). Major exclusion criteria were a
total collateral ligament rupture and a full-thickness cartilage lesion visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (Additional exclusion criteria can be found in Table A in the Supplementary
Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.)
All eligible subjects received standardized information about the trial orally, in writing, and
by DVD.[11] They were randomly assigned by
computer-generated random numbers in permuted blocks of 20 to undergo either structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction (referred
to as the early-reconstruction group) or structured rehabilitation with the option of delayed
ACL reconstruction for those with symptomatic
knee instability who met specific protocol guidelines (referred to as the optional delayed-reconstruction group) (see the Supplementary Appendix). An investigator who was not involved in the
randomization procedure prepared all sequential­
ly numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes containing the assigned interventions to ensure that the
sequence was concealed. For the subjects’ convenience, MRI was performed at the time of randomization, but the results were not available
until 2 to 3 days later, at which time the MRI
findings were used to confirm that the inclusion
criteria were met, including the presence of acute
ACL tears (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Randomization was performed without knowledge of the MRI findings, and the MRI scans
were assessed without knowledge of the assigned
intervention. None of the study funders had any
role in data collection, storage, or analysis; in
the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision
to submit the manuscript for publication.

**Study Treatments**
All subjects followed a rehabilitation protocol consistent with the consensus in the literature[13] (see
Appendix A in the Supplementary Appendix). Rehabilitation was initiated before or at the time of
randomization and was supervised by experienced
physical therapists at nine outpatient clinics. The
protocol included goals for range of motion,
muscle function, and functional performance at
each of four levels, and these goals had to be met
before a subject could progress to the next higher level. Slower progression was expected in the
subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus ACL re

construction. Pain and swelling slowed progression, and subjects in whom these problems persisted were scheduled to see the treating clinician.
In the subjects randomly assigned to structured rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, surgery was performed within 10 weeks
after the injury by one of four senior knee surgeons, each of whom performed more than 40
ACL reconstructions annually. The choice of procedure depended on the surgeon’s preference.
The patella–tendon procedure,[14] used in 25 subjects, involves the central third of the ipsilateral
patellar tendon as an autograft with fixation of
the bone blocks within the tibia and femur; the
hamstring–tendon procedure,[15] used in 36 subjects, involves a four-layer autograft made up of
folded-over gracilis and semitendinosus muscle
tendons. In randomized trials, these two methods
have resulted in similar outcomes.[16,17] Surgery
was performed while the patients were under
general anesthesia, and meniscal surgery was
carried out as needed, followed by ACL reconstruction. The subjects randomly assigned to
structured rehabilitation plus optional delayed
ACL reconstruction followed the rehabilitation
protocol. Subjects in this group were referred for
delayed ACL reconstruction, performed by the
same surgeons who performed the surgical procedures in the early-reconstruction group, if they
chose surgery and if prespecified criteria were met
(self-reported symptomatic instability caused by
ACL insufficiency and a positive pivot shift test

[as described in Table B in the Supplementary
Appendix]).

**Other Treatments**
Baseline MRI verified ACL rupture, meniscal
tears, and other injuries (Table 1, and the Supplementary Appendix). In both groups, meniscal
tears were treated with partial resection or fixation when indicated by MRI findings and clinical
signs (see the Supplementary Appendix). In subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL
reconstruction, additional meniscal surgery was
performed if unstable meniscal tears were identified during the baseline surgery. Meniscocapsular separations of less than 10 mm were treated
with arthroscopic fixation. Fixation of larger meniscal tears required a change in the postoperative rehabilitation regimen and therefore resulted
in exclusion from the study (Fig. 1, and the Supplementary Appendix). During follow-up, 24 subjects had signs of a meniscal tear and were treat

ed by means of arthroscopic surgery (Table D in
the Supplementary Appendix).

**Outcome Measures**
Subjects were evaluated 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
after randomization. At each visit, subjects completed the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Medical Outcomes Study 36Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and TAS
questionnaires before seeing the clinician.
The primary outcome was the change from
baseline to 2 years in the average score for four
of the five KOOS subscales, covering pain, symptoms, difficulty in sports and recreational activities, and quality of life (KOOS4), with scores
ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).[19,20] KOOS
has been validated and is used for patients undergoing ACL reconstruction.[19,20,22-24] Prespecified
secondary outcomes included results on all five
KOOS subscales (the fifth scale being activities
of daily living), the scores on the SF-36 physical
and mental components (range, 0 [worst] to 100

[best]),[21] results on the TAS,[12] the area under the
curve (AUC) for the development of absolute
scores (KOOS4 score per visit × time to follow-up

[in days]) from baseline to 2 years, and the percentage of subjects with a KOOS quality-of-life
score below 44 (a prespecified cutoff value consistent with a report of more than moderately
decreased knee-related quality of life) between
6 months and 2 years. Subjects reported their
preinjury TAS score at baseline and their score at
each follow-up visit; we compared scores between
groups as well as the percentage of subjects in
each group whose TAS score at 2 years was at
least as high as their preinjury score.
Exploratory outcomes included knee stability,
as determined with the use of the Lachman test;
results on the pivot shift test; and findings on
KT1000 (MEDmetric) arthrometry, an instrument­
ed test to assess anteroposterior translation of
the knee. These assessments were performed by
one of two experienced clinicians, both of whom
were aware of the treatment assignments.
We performed a post hoc analysis based on the
treatment received: rehabilitation plus early ACL
reconstruction, rehabilitation plus delayed ACL reconstruction, or rehabilitation alone.

**Adverse Events**
Clinic records were reviewed for all study visits
and for appointments that took place outside the
study. The computerized medical records system

for the health care region was searched for any
patient visit to any health care facility during the
2-year follow-up period, and any adverse events
were identified. Anesthesia and surgery records
were retrieved for all surgical procedures, including the initial study treatment. At the 2-year study
visit, the subjects filled out questionnaires to report any adverse events, illnesses, and medication
use since the start of the study. Physical therapists
involved in the study reported any adverse event
that interfered with rehabilitation (Table 2, and
the Supplementary Appendix).

**Statistical Analysis**
All subjects who were assigned to treatment, excluding the 20 who were deemed ineligible after
randomization, were included in the efficacy
analyses. Between-group comparisons of the primary end point were made with the use of analysis of covariance stratified by site and adjusted
for baseline KOOS4 scores. A confidence interval
excluding differences greater than 10 units between groups was interpreted as indicating the
absence of a clinically meaningful difference.[25]

Other end points were analyzed with the use
of analysis of covariance (KOOS and SF-36 scores),
the Mann–Whitney U test and the Kruskal–
Wallis test (TAS score and KOOS4 AUC, respectively, for the two groups in the intention-totreat analysis and the three groups in a post hoc
as-treated analysis), and the chi-square test (frequency of a return to preinjury TAS score, positive Lachman and pivot shift tests, and severely
decreased knee-related quality of life). The frequencies of meniscal resection, procedures requiring general anesthesia, and the distribution
of adverse events were compared between the
two groups with the use of the binomial test for
two Poisson-distributed variables.
The initial sample-size calculation was based
on a plan to stratify according to the preinjury
TAS score (5 to 7 [moderate activity level] vs. 8 or
9 [high activity level]). Assuming a standard
deviation of 15 points for the primary outcome
(change from baseline in the KOOS4 score) and
allowing for a 20% dropout rate, we estimated
that 168 patients would be needed to provide 80%
statistical power to detect a 10-point difference
between the two groups. When 25% of the subjects in the originally estimated sample had been
randomly assigned to a treatment group, a second
sample-size calculation that included empirical


**Characteristics of the Subjects**
Enrollment took place from February 2002 through
June 2006, and the 2-year follow-up was concluded in June 2008. Of 642 subjects screened for eligibility (Fig. 1), 446 were ineligible for inclusion,
and 55 of the 196 eligible subjects declined participation; thus, 141 subjects underwent randomization. The characteristics of the subjects who
declined participation were similar to those of the
subjects assigned to a treatment group.[11] Sixty-nine
subjects were randomly assigned to undergo rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, and 72
to undergo rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL
reconstruction. After randomization but before
treatment, 20 of the initially eligible subjects were
excluded because of findings on MRI (in 12) or
baseline arthroscopy (in 8) (exclusion criteria are
described in Table A in the Supplementary Appendix). Consequently, these subjects were not included in the analyses, leaving 62 subjects in the
early-reconstruction group and 59 in the optional
delayed-reconstruction group. The subjects who
were excluded after randomization were similar
to those assigned to treatment with respect to age,
average KOOS4 score (39.5 and 37.0, respectively),
scores on the SF-36 physical and mental components (data not shown), and median TAS score
(8 for both groups). The subjects in the optional
delayed-reconstruction group had fewer rehabilitation visits than did those in the early-reconstruction group (mean, 53 vs. 63; P = 0.05) (Table
D in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition,
there were no differences in baseline characteristics among the three as-treated groups (Table F
in the Supplementary Appendix).


data was performed by an independent statistician without breaking the code. Again based on
a plan for separate analyses for subjects with
high and those with moderate preinjury activity
levels, inclusion of 120 patients was considered
sufficient to provide 80% power to detect the
requisite 10-point difference. The plan to stratify
according to activity level was abandoned shortly thereafter owing to low recruitment of subjects with moderate activity levels. This further
reduced the necessary sample size. No interim
analysis was performed. All reported P values
are two-sided and were not adjusted for multiple
comparisons.

interval, −6.5 to 6.8; P = 0.96, adjusted for baseline KOOS4 score). Of the 59 subjects in the optional delayed-reconstruction group, 23 underwent
ACL reconstruction an average of 11.6 months
after randomization. Of these 23 subjects, 22 met
specific protocol guidelines and 1 chose delayed
ACL reconstruction without reporting symptomatic instability (Table B in the Supplementary Appendix).

**Secondary and Other End Points**
There were no significant between-group differences for any patient-reported secondary outcomes
at 2 years, including knee-related outcomes, health
status, and return to preinjury activity level (Table 3). Subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus
early ACL reconstruction had greater knee stability at 2 years (Table 3). The post hoc as-treated
analysis likewise showed no significant differences between the three treatment groups at the
2-year follow-up (Fig. 2, and Table G in the Supplementary Appendix).


**Other Treatments**
Subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL
reconstruction had a higher frequency of meniscal surgery at study initiation and a lower frequency of delayed meniscal surgery than did subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus optional
delayed ACL reconstruction. Overall, the number
of meniscal operations in the two groups totaled
40 and 50, respectively (P = 0.20) (see the Supplementary Appendix).

**Safety**
Adverse events were common in both study
groups (Table 3, and Table E in the Supplementary Appendix). The frequency of serious adverse
events involving the index knee did not differ significantly between the groups (P = 0.06). Three
ACL graft ruptures and one case of arthrofibrosis
were reported among subjects randomly assigned
to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction,
and one ACL graft rupture was reported in a subject assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. A total of 80 surgical
procedures (requiring anesthesia) were performed

Discussion


The results of this randomized, controlled trial
involving physically active adults with an acute
ACL rupture indicate that a strategy of early ACL
reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation was
not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation with
the option of delayed ACL reconstruction when
needed. Early reconstruction as compared with
the option of delayed reconstruction did not result in a significant improvement in the primary
outcome — the change in the KOOS4 score between baseline and 2 years — or in any of the
prespecified secondary outcomes, which included pain, symptoms, function in activities of daily
living, function in sports and recreation, kneerelated quality of life, KOOS4 AUC, general health
status, activity level, and return to preinjury activity level at 2 years.
We are aware of two prior randomized, controlled trials comparing surgical and nonsurgical treatment of ACL injuries,[26,27] but both assessed surgical repair (not reconstruction) of the
torn ACL, and one[26] was limited by inconsistencies in treatment assignment and treatment indications for the surgical group.[6] Thus, highlevel evidence is lacking to support the contention
that outcomes are better with routine early ACL
reconstruction than with an initial strategy of
nonsurgical treatment.[6] Two observational studies showed similar outcomes for patients who
underwent ACL reconstructive surgery and those
who received nonoperative treatment of the ruptured ACL,[28,29] but the observational design precludes conclusions about cause and effect.[3,30]

Both groups in our study had substantial improvement over the 2-year follow-up period. The
overall KOOS result at 2 years was similar to that
in other studies of ACL reconstruction[20,22,23,31-33]
and to KOOS4 results 2 years after surgery for
patients of similar age included in the Swedish
National ACL Register (Ageberg E: personal communication).[34] The median activity scores 2 years
after ACL reconstruction in our study were also
similar to those reported by other investigators.[35-38] In addition, rates of normal results on
Lachman and pivot shift tests at 2 years among
the subjects treated with early ACL reconstruc

tion in our trial were similar to those reported
in a meta-analysis of studies of ACL reconstruction.[39] These similarities in outcomes between
our results and those reported elsewhere suggest
that our findings are generalizable.
With the strategy of providing structured rehabilitation alone initially instead of structured
rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, surgical reconstruction was avoided in 61% of the
subjects without compromising the results. Our
post hoc as-treated analysis identified no significant differences in self-reported outcomes at
2 years among the subjects treated with rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, those treated with rehabilitation plus delayed ACL reconstruction, and those treated with rehabilitation alone
(Table G in the Supplementary Appendix).
Small meniscal tears diagnosed by MRI at
baseline were managed more aggressively in the
subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL
reconstruction and were more likely to be left
untreated in the subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction;
this difference probably explains the greater frequency of meniscal surgery during follow-up in
the latter group. Although the rate of adverse
events in our study was higher than the reported
rates in other studies of patients with ACL rupture, we believe this difference reflects our more
comprehensive approach to collecting such information.[40]

Our study had certain limitations. First, we
did not include a sham-surgery control group;
however, the use of sham surgery as a control
would have tended to bias the results in favor of
early surgery. Second, assessors were aware of
the treatment assignments, but they measured
only knee stability. Third, we were unable to
stratify study groups according to activity level,
and our conclusions are best generalized to young
adults who have high preinjury activity levels but
are not professional athletes. Fourth, it cannot
be assumed that rehabilitation programs that
differ from the supervised program used in our
study would result in similar findings. Finally,
continued follow-up is warranted to assess longerterm outcomes, including the risk of knee osteo­
arthritis.[3]
In summary, our findings indicate that in
young, active adults with an acute ACL tear, a
strategy of structured rehabilitation plus early ACL
reconstruction did not result in better patient

reported outcomes at 2 years than a strategy of
rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction in those with symptomatic instability.
With the use of the latter strategy, more than
half the ACL reconstructions could be avoided
without adversely affecting outcomes.
