Postoperative stiffness of the knee is a well-recognised
complication of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).[1-3] In particular, early reconstruction after tears
of the ACL has been associated with an increased incidence
of stiffness and prolonged rehabilitation.[4] A delay in surgical reconstruction also has a potential morbidity, such as
inability to return to employment or sporting activities, as
well as an increased risk of meniscal damage from further

injuries because of instability of the knee.[5] Currently, many
surgeons prefer to treat injuries of the ACL with an initial
period of rehabilitation followed by reconstruction two
months or more after the injury.[4,6]

Previous studies have suggested that the risk of joint
stiffness is greatest if the surgery is carried out two to eight
weeks after injury.[2] It has been proposed that early reconstruction, within a week of injury, will minimise the risk of
stiffness. Immediate reconstruction in suitable patients may
have other advantages, such as a reduction in the overall
rehabilitation period and an earlier return to sporting and
occupational activities.[7] On this basis many surgeons now
carry out an immediate reconstruction of the ACL on athletic patients.[5,8] Although modern methods of reconstruction with minimally invasive techniques and accelerated
rehabilitation appear to have reduced the risks associated
with early reconstruction, there is limited evidence in the literature to support this approach. Our aim in this prospective, randomised study therefore was to compare the
functional outcome of early and delayed reconstruction of
the ACL in order to determine whether there was an advantage to early reconstruction.

### Patients and Methods

We randomised 31 patients with acute tears of the ACL by
selection of an envelope to either an early, within two weeks
(group I), or delayed reconstruction, between 8 and 12
weeks (group II). The inclusion criteria are given in Table I.

Lysholm[9] is given in Table II. There were 28 men and three
women with a mean age of 21 years (15 to 35). Most ruptures had occurred while playing football (18 patients),
rugby (6 patients) and basketball (4 patients).
All the patients were seen at a specialist soft-tissue knee
injury clinic between October 1996 and May 2000. The
diagnosis was made on the basis of an acute haemarthrosis
associated with clinical signs of laxity of the ACL. Patients
with associated medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprains
were excluded. Group I (13 patients) had an early reconstruction carried out within two weeks. Group II (18
patients) had preoperative physiotherapy to restore knee
movement and underwent reconstruction between eight and
12 weeks after injury.
We confirmed the diagnosis at the time of surgery and
the ACL was reconstructed with a quadruple hamstring graft
inserted by an arthroscopically-assisted, single-incision
technique. On the femoral side an Endobutton secured the
graft and on the tibial side a soft-tissue interference screw.
The patients in both groups underwent an identical postoperative programme of accelerated rehabilitation. This
concentrated particularly on the management of the softtissue swelling, the recovery of full extension of the knee
and muscle control, and on proprioception exercises.
All patients were followed up for one year and none was
lost to follow-up. Clinical assessments were made before
operation and after surgery at two, six, 12, 24, and 52
weeks. Any postoperative complications were recorded. A
research physiotherapist (EW), blinded to the randomisation, carried out isokinetic muscle testing of the quadriceps
and hamstring muscles with a dynamometer (Biodex system
2; Biodex Medical Systems Shirley New York) at 12 24

and 52 weeks after operation. The range of knee movement
was measured with a long-arm goniometer. There was an
active warm-up period before each test, followed by measurements of flexion and extension at 180˚/second. The physiotherapist repeated the tests ten times using standardised
commands. The values obtained in the injured limb were
compared with those of the uninjured side, which was considered to be normal for that patient. We expressed the
results for the injured knee as a percentage loss when compared with the normal side. The IKDC score assessed functional outcome.[10,11]

**Statistical analysis. A comparison of means was carried**
out by Student’s t-test. For non-parametric data we used the
Mann-Whitney U test for unpaired data and the Wilcoxon
test for paired comparisons.

### Results

**Early postoperative outcome. The mean tourniquet time**
for group I was 67 minutes compared with 74 minutes for
group II (p = 0.3). Meniscal tears were identified in three
patients in group I and in four in group II. The presence of a
meniscal tear was not associated with a poorer outcome
during the period of study. The reconstruction failed in one
patient in group II shortly after the 12-week assessment. He
subsequently underwent a revision reconstruction and his
data are not included beyond the 12-week assessment. In
group I there was one superficial wound infection and two
patients developed a symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis and
required anticoagulation.
**Range of movement. The range of flexion was reduced in**
group I for all measurements made in the first 12 weeks
after surgery (Table III). This difference was significant at
two weeks. The trend was evident throughout the period of
follow-up, although the differences were most apparent
during the first three months (Fig 1) There was no signifi

cant difference in the loss of extension of the knee between
the two groups at any stage. At the final follow-up (52
weeks) the mean range of movement in both groups was the
same. Clinically significant residual stiffness (fixed flexion
deformity >5˚, flexion <120˚) was present in one patient in
each group. The patient in group II subsequently underwent
a successful arthrolysis.
**Muscle function. The mean quadriceps power and total**
work were reduced in group I at all measurement intervals
(Table IV). This trend continued for 52 weeks but the differences were only significant at 12 weeks (p < 0.03). Hamstring power, torque and total work were reduced at 12
weeks in group I. The difference was not significant. The
results after 12 weeks for the hamstrings were similar in
both groups.
**Functional outcome. There were no differences in the**
IKDC scores at 52 weeks. There were two abnormal results
in group I. One patient had a painful tibial fixation screw
which impaired function at one year. This was subsequently
removed. The other had troublesome knee stiffness (range
of movement 10˚ to 122˚). He declined further surgical
treatment. In group II there were three abnormal results.
One patient had a significant reinjury and ruptured the ACL
graft. Another complained of subjective instability although
the graft was intact. The third had persistent knee stiffness
(range of movement 5˚ to 120˚) and underwent an arthrolysis, which was successful in restoring movement.
The Tegner activity scores were reduced for the whole
study group when compared with their preinjury levels
(Table II; p < 0.002) with no differences between groups I
and II.

### Discussion

We have found no evidence to suggest that an early reconstruction is of benefit to athletic individuals with an acute
rupture of the ACL. The movement returns more slowly and
the recovery of muscle function is delayed after an early
reconstruction. However, one year after surgery there was
no difference between early and delayed reconstruction in
terms of muscle function, range of movement and functional outcome. There was an increased rate of complications in the early group with one patient having stiffness of
the knee and two having clinically significant deep-vein
thromboses. There was no difference in the incidence of
meniscal tears between the two groups


This is the first randomised comparison of early and
delayed reconstruction of the ACL using objective outcome
assessments. The patients were carefully selected in order to
exclude patients with associated sprains of the medial collateral ligament and previous problems in the knee. All
patients underwent identical surgical treatment and accelerated postoperative rehabilitation and objective assessments
were undertaken by a research assistant who was blinded to
the randomisation. The main disadvantage of the study, the
small sample size, is mainly due to the pattern of presentation. Restrictions in access to acute orthopaedic services and
stringent inclusion criteria contributed to the difficulty of
recruiting larger numbers of patients.
Other studies have investigated the risks of immediate
or very early reconstruction of the ACL. Shelbourne and
Foulk[12] found a delayed return of quadriceps strength in
patients who elected to have an early reconstruction and a
slower progress to sport-specific rehabilitation exercises.
An increased incidence of arthrofibrosis was also reported
if the reconstruction was carried out within one week of
injury.[4] They therefore recommended that surgery be
delayed by at least three weeks, and suggested introducing
an accelerated postoperative rehabilitation programme to
reduce knee stiffness. Several authors have found similar
results, with an increase in arthrofibrosis and a decrease in
quadriceps strength after an acute reconstruction.[2,13]

These studies were retrospective, included a variety of ligament injuries and surgical techniques, and had restrictive
postoperative rehabilitation regimes. Accelerated protocols of knee rehabilitation with early knee movement after
reconstruction of the ACL are now common and not associated with an increase in complications or morbidity.[1]

This has led to the widespread practice of early reconstruction on the basis that it may shorten rehabilitation and
allow an earlier return to the preinjury level of muscle
function and sporting activity, as well as an economic
advantage.[7]

Karlsson et al[5] found that reconstruction between two
and 12 weeks after injury resulted in a higher activity level
for competitive athletes. There was also a decrease in
meniscal damage when compared with delayed surgery.
Other authors have found no differences in function or
strength tests relative to the timing of surgery.[5,7,8] These
findings disagree with our results and those of Shelbourne et
al,[4] in which recovery of muscle function was slower in the
early reconstruction group


-----

We therefore conclude that there is no advantage in
early reconstruction for isolated tears of the ACL and that
this is associated with an increased rate of complications.
Delayed surgery is associated with a more rapid return of
movement and muscle function. In addition, a delay in surgical intervention allows the surgeon time to assess more
carefully a patient’s suitability for reconstruction of the
ACL.
