# A comparison of early and delayed arthroscopically-assisted reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using hamstring autograft

**Delayed rather than early reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament is the current**
**recommended treatment for injury to this ligament since it is thought to give a better**
**functional outcome. We randomised 105 consecutive patients with injury associated with**
**chondral lesions no more severe than grades 1 and 2 and/or meniscal tears which only**
**required trimming, to early (< two weeks) or delayed (> four to six weeks) reconstruction of**
**the anterior cruciate ligament using a quadrupled hamstring graft. All operations were**
**performed by a single surgeon and a standard rehabilitation regime was followed in both**
**groups. The outcomes were assessed using the Lysholm score, the Tegner score and**
**measurement of the range of movement. Stability was assessed by clinical tests and**
**measurements taken with the KT-1000 arthrometer, with all testing performed by a blinded**
**uninvolved experienced observer. A total of six patients were lost to follow-up, with**
**48 patients assigned to the delayed group and 51 to the early group. None was a**
**competitive athlete. The mean interval between injury and the surgery was seven days**
**(2 to 14) in the early group and 32 days (29 to 42) in the delayed group. The mean follow-up**
**was 32 months (26 to 36).**
**The results did not show a statistically significant difference for the Lysholm score**
**(p = 0.86), Tegner activity score (p = 0.913) or the range of movement (p = 1). Similarly, no**
**distinction could be made for stability testing by clinical examination (p = 0.56) and**
**measurements with the KT-1000 arthrometer (p = 0.93).**
**Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament gave a similar clinical and functional**
**outcome whether performed early (< two weeks) or late at four to six weeks after injury.**


The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the primary stabiliser of the knee against anterior
translation of the tibia relative to the femur and
is important in counteracting rotational and
valgus stresses.[1-3] It is the most commonly torn
ligament in the knee and is a more common
injury in female patients.[4,5] Reconstruction of
the ACL-deficient knee is accepted as standard
treatment for young and active patients.
Reconstruction of the ACL allows the patient
to resume sporting activities and is reported to
delay the onset of osteoarthritis which is associated with loss of meniscal function.[6-11] There is
uncertainty regarding the timing of surgery with
both early and late reconstruction being advocated. Shelbourne and Patel[12] recommended
reconstruction after three weeks to prevent the
occurrence of arthrofibrosis, and this view has
been expressed by others.[13-15] One report found
an increased incidence of arthrofibrosis if surgery was performed within a week and recommended that surgery be delayed for at least three
weeks.[14] Post-operative stiffness has been well


documented by various studies.[16-18] A number
of authors have suggested that early surgery
adversely affected the outcomes.[19-24] Two studies using hamstring tendons for reconstruction
of the ACL compared the outcome after early or
delayed reconstruction.[25,26 ]Meighal, et al[25] recommended that there was no functional advantage following early reconstruction of the ACL.
Botoni et al[26] and did not observe any loss of
motion following early reconstruction. Daniel
et al[28] have reported a higher incidence of
arthritis of the knee after surgical treatment.
We have compared the clinical and functional
outcome of arthroscopically-assisted reconstruction of the ACL using a quadrupled hamstring autograft performed early (< two weeks)
with that performed late (> four to six weeks)
after injury.

## Patients and Methods
Our study was approved by the institutional
review board and informed consent was
obtained from all the patients. We included

patients who presented to the emergency department of our
hospital and were diagnosed with a torn ACL as seen on an
MR scan. We excluded those with concomitant ligamentous injuries, ipsilateral long-bone injuries and the requirement of an additional procedure such as meniscal repair on
the same knee, aged under 18 years, any previous injuries
or operations on the same knee, and Outerbridge grade-3
and grade-4 chondral injuries detected intra-operatively.
Patients requiring meniscal trimming or trimming of chondral injuries of less than grade 3 on the O’Connors classification system[29] were not excluded.
Between August 2004 and November 2006, 115 patients
presented with rupture of the ACL. Of these, ten were
excluded because of the presence of grade-3 or grade-4
chondral lesions or repairable meniscal injuries. The
remaining 105 patients were randomly allocated into one
of two groups using a computer-generated randomisation
sequence. The patients who were selected for early surgery
had the procedure within one day. Those in the delayed surgery group underwent a pre-operative rehabilitation programme which included range-of-movement exercises on
the knee and hamstrings and quadriceps strengthening
exercises. Additionally, a hinged brace was applied which
was locked in extension for walking, with weight-bearing
allowed as tolerated. When not walking they were allowed
a full range of knee movement in the brace.
At the initial evaluation a detailed clinical history was
obtained regarding the mechanism of injury. The surgical
procedure was standardised for all patients and was carried
out by the same surgeon, (GK). All were operated on under
bupivacaine epidural anaesthesia.
An examination under anaesthesia was performed before
inflation of the tourniquet and included the Lachman, anterior-drawer and pivot-shift tests. Cefuroxime (1 g) was given
intravenously as prophylaxis. An initial arthroscopy was
undertaken to confirm the diagnosis and to assess any associated injuries with chondroplasty and any meniscal trimming
performed as required. A quadrupled hamstring graft was
fashioned from harvested semitendinosis and gracilis tendons
in all patients. A Biotransfix system (Arthrex, Naples, Florida)
was employed for femoral fixation and a Biointerference
screw (Arthrex) was used on the tibial side. The rehabilitation
protocol was the same in both groups. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs were not administered for the first two
weeks after surgery.
**Operative technique. The hamstring autograft was har-**
vested using a tendon stripper through a small incision near
the insertions of gracilis and semitendinosis. A quadruple
construct was made and held with Ethibond stitches on
either side.
After preparing the tibial tunnel using a standard guide, a
transtibial technique was used to make the femoral tunnel.
This was accomplished using a 7 mm offset guide (Arthrex)
with the femoral tunnel made up to a length of 40 mm. The
Biotransfix system guide was used to make a slot for the
proximal fixation of the graft with a Biotransfix screw. A


nitinol wire was passed through this slot and was subsequently pulled out into the tibial tunnel by the standard
guide system. This wire was then used to draw the autograft
into the femoral tunnel. Once in the tunnel care was taken to
make sure that there was a smooth passage of the wire over
the graft.
The Biotransfix screw was passed over the nitinol wire
and tightened. The graft was pulled distally to ensure that
fixation was complete. The nitinol wire was removed and the
knee cycled 20 times to eliminate any creep in the graft. Distal fixation of the graft to the tibia was carried out using a
Biointerference screw with the knee in 20° of flexion. Placement of the screw was confirmed under arthroscopic guidance, the tension in the reconstructed ligament was checked
using a probe and a Lachman test performed. The knee was
irrigated and the portals and medial tibial wounds were
closed. No drains were used at the site of the tibial incision.
The knee was injected with 10 ml of lidocaine (2% plain)
and 10 ml of bupivacaine (0.5% plain).
Post-operative analgesia was provided with tramadol for
24 hours. A single dose of subcutaneous fondaparinux
(2.5 mg) was given six hours post-operatively. The patient
was mobilised and discharged on the first post-operative day.
**Post-operative rehabilitation. Post-operatively, the patients**
were placed in a hinged knee brace and touch weight-bearing
was allowed for two weeks, during which time the range of
movement was restricted to 0° to 90° of flexion. Subsequently, they progressed to weight-bearing as tolerated with
the range of movement no longer restricted, but with wearing of the brace for six weeks.
Rehabilitation consisted of a progression through range-ofmovement exercises, patellar mobilisation, electrical stimulation if needed, and proprioceptive and closed-chain strengthening exercises during the first three months after operation.
This was followed by straight-line jogging and exercises specific to the patients’ preferred sport. The patients were followed up at intervals of two, six and 12 weeks postoperatively, then at six months and thereafter at six-monthly
intervals. They were allowed to return to their pre-injury
sporting leisure activities at a minimum of six months after
reconstruction, using a custom-made brace which was discarded nine months post surgery.
**Clinical evaluation of joint function and stability. The range**
of movement of the knee was measured with a goniometer
with the patient supine using fixed anatomical landmarks
and taking the mean of three values. The heel was elevated
on a support to determine if there was passive hyperextension while active knee extension was measured by asking
the patient to perform a straight-leg raise against gravity.
The range of movement was recorded for both the involved
and normal sides. Examination for laxity included the
Lachman, pivot-shift, anterior-drawer, and varus/valgus
stress tests. The assessment of clinical function and joint
laxity was undertaken by a single blinded observer, who
was a physiotherapist with 15 years experience and had not
been involved in the surgery.

The Lachman test was graded as normal if there was
side-to-side difference of < 5 mm and abnormal if this was

- 5 mm. The pivot-shift test was graded as normal in the
absence of a clunk or abnormal if a clunk was felt. Anterior
tibial translation was measured using the KT 1000
arthrometer (MEDmetric Corporation, San Diego, California) with the knee positioned in 25° to 30° of flexion. Both
knees were measured and the side-to-side difference in anterior tibial translation was determined. The Lysholm and
Tegner activity scores[30] were also recorded.
**Statistical analysis. Considering the proportion of patients**
of at least 70% to be significantly different with the primary
outcome between the two groups and a null value of 50, it
was estimated that 47 patients per group were required with
an α-level of 0.05 and a power of 80%. The outcome scores
in both the groups were compared using the independent
Student’s _t-tests. The Bonferroni[31] correction was used to_
correct for multiple testing at the different time intervals. The
chi-squared test was used for the comparison of categorical
data. The data are presented as the mean (SD) and the statistical analysis performed using SPSS version 14 software
for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). A p-value ≤ 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.

## Results
Of the 105 patients entered into the study, six were lost to
follow-up. Of the remaining 99, 51 were in the early and
48 in the delayed group. Their mean age was 31.4 years
(19 to 38). The mean period between injury and the oper

ation was seven days (2 to 14) in the early group and
32 days (29 to 42) in the delayed group. The mean followup was 32 months (26 to 36). The distribution of age, gender and mechanism of injury for each group is given in
Table I. None was a competitive athlete who had participated in sport at state or national level. The sporting
activities in both the groups were similar (cricket; early
group-12, delayed group-15. Soccer; early group-12,
delayed group-14). Of the 99 patients 60 had chondral
and 73 had meniscal injuries. The distribution of these
injuries in both the early and delayed groups were comparable (Table II). All the meniscal tears identified were
either debrided or underwent partial excision. The chondral injuries were either Outerbridge grade 1 or grade 2.
The recovery of the range of movement at various intervals showed no statistical difference between the two groups
(Table III). No statistically significant difference was found
for the Lysholm score (p = 0.86) and Tegner activity score
(p = 0.913). Stability testing by clinical examination
(p = 0.56) and measurements on the KT-1000 arthrometer
(p = 0.93), were comparable in both groups (Table IV).
**Complications. Two patients in the early group had a**
superficial wound infection around the site of the tibial
tunnel, which responded to treatment with oral antibiotics. One patient in the delayed group had pain at the
site of insertion of the tibial screw at six weeks which had
resolved at the 12-week follow-up.
None of the patients in either group required revision at
the last follow-up.

## Discussion
Our findings show that arthroscopically-assisted reconstruction of the ACL using a quadrupled hamstring
autograft gives a similar clinical and functional outcome
irrespective of the timing of the procedure. Furthermore, no
significant differences were found between the groups for
the recovery of the range of movement. This finding suggests that reconstruction can be reasonably undertaken at
any time within six weeks of injury without compromising
the outcomes.
There are no criteria which define the timing of early or
late surgery for reconstruction of the ACL. Bottoni et al,[26]

classified early as within 21 days and delayed as beyond
six weeks. Meighan et al,[25] described early as less than
two weeks and delayed between eight and 12 weeks.
Majors and Woodfin[23] considered early to be one to
14 days, delayed between 15 and 28 days and late more
than 28 days.


Stiffness of the knee is a well-recognised complication
after reconstruction of the ACL. Early reconstruction has
been associated with an increased incidence of stiffness and
prolonged rehabilitation.[13-15] However, the post-operative
rehabilitation has varied and in some series there have been
associated injuries which have required reconstruction and
which may have compromised the ultimate range of movement.[15] Only one prospectiv6 study has supported early
reconstruction. Bottoni et al[26] reported an excellent outcome
after reconstruction within three weeks of injury and suggested that as long as aggressive rehabilitation was followed
the outcome would not be compromised. Meighan et al[25] in
a prospective study using hamstring tendons reported that
there was no advantage in early reconstruction of isolated
tears of the ACL, but found a higher rate of complications. In
their study, delayed surgery was reported to give a rapid
return of movement and muscle function. However, one year
after surgery there was no difference between early and

delayed reconstruction in terms of muscle function, range of
movement and the functional outcome.
We found that there was no significant difference in the
recovery of the range of movement at any interval
(Table III). Additionally, the final follow-up Tegner and
Lyshom scores were comparable in both the groups, indicating that the functional outcome was similar in early and
delayed reconstruction.
It has been reported that delayed reconstruction of the
ACL is associated with an increase in the incidence of associated damage to the menisci and articular cartilage.[27,32-34]

Our delayed patients were treated before two months after
injury unlike the delayed patients reported elsewhere.[32]

However, the increased incidence of meniscal damage with
delayed surgery has not been found in every series.[26]

In our study the inclusion criteria were strict so that only
isolated injuries of the ACL and meniscal injuries which
required only limited debridement were included. Chondral
injuries more severe than grade 3 or grade 4 were excluded.
The classical report of O’Donoghue[35] described the association of medial meniscal injury with tears of the ACL. In
our study both groups had a greater number of lateral meniscal than medial meniscal tears although this difference was
not statistically significant (Table II). The predominance of
tears of the lateral meniscal has been observed elsewhere.[36,37]

In our study a goniometer was used by a blinded single
observer to measure the range of movement as was
described by Meighan et al.[25] Criticism of the goniometer
method was made by Austin, Phornphutkul and Wojtys[38]

because of the level of the interobserver difference. Readings with a goniometer were taken by an experienced physiotherapist since this is a simple and inexpensive method of
measuring the joint angle. A set protocol was followed and
the same anatomical landmarks were used.
Accelerated protocols of knee rehabilitation with early
movement after reconstruction of the ACL are now common and have not been associated with an increase in complications or morbidity.[39] We believe that the early
mobilisation and rehabilitation of our patients accounted
for the prompt recovery of movement. Our findings are
similar to those of Hunter et al[22] who also concluded that
by using modern arthroscopic surgical techniques and an
aggressive post-operative protocol of physiotherapy, movement and stability could be restored in a high proportion of
patients and that surgical success was independent of the
timing of surgery.
The strength of our study is the large number of patients
included, the prospective documentation of the data, strict
inclusion criteria, and minimal loss to follow-up. We recognise that the exclusion of patients with coexistent grade-3
and grade-4 chondral injuries and meniscal injuries requiring repair, meant we had selected patients who were likely
to have a more favourable outcome. Theoretically those
injuries might have detracted from the results since the
rehabilitation would have had to have been tailored according to these additional injuries.
