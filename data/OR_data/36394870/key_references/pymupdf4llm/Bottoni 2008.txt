**Background: There is a common belief that surgical reconstruction of an acutely torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) should be**
delayed for at least 3 weeks because of the increased incidence of postoperative motion loss (arthrofibrosis) and suboptimal clinical results.

**Hypothesis: There is no difference in postoperative range of motion or stability after ACL reconstructions performed either**
acutely or delayed.

**Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1.**

**Methods: Patients with an acute ACL tear were prospectively randomized to either early (within 21days) or delayed (beyond 6**
weeks) reconstruction using autograft hamstring tendon. Previous knee surgery on the index extremity and a multiligamentous
injury were exclusionary criteria. Surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation were identical for all patients. Postoperative
assessments included range of motion and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements compared with the contralateral knee.
Standardized outcome measures were used including single assessment numeric evaluation (SANE), Lysholm, and Tegner
Activity Score.

**Results: Seventy consecutive patients were enrolled, and 1 patient was dropped after a postoperative infection. Sixty-nine**
patients (34 acute, 35 delayed) with an average age of 27 years composed the study cohort. The mean time from injury to surgery was 9 days (range, 2-17 days) for patients in the early group and 85 days (range, 42-192) for those in the delayed group.
The average follow-up from surgery was 366 days (range, 185-869). Articular cartilage and meniscal injuries were comparable
between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups in degrees of extension or flexion
lost relative to the nonoperative side, operative time, KT-1000 arthrometer differences, or subjective knee evaluations.

**Conclusion: Excellent clinical results can be achieved after ACL reconstructions performed soon after injury using autograft**
hamstrings. Although the authors do not advocate that all reconstructions should be performed acutely, they found that early
ACL reconstructions do not result in loss of motion or suboptimal clinical results as long as a rehabilitation protocol emphasizing extension and early range of motion is employed.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the most common
completely torn ligament injury in the knee.[17] The typical
treatment for a young athlete with a complete ACL tear is
a surgical reconstruction. More than 100 000 ACL reconstructions are performed in the United States annually.[18]

More ACL reconstructions are performed on young male
athletes than female athletes because males participate in
sports that are at high risk for ACL injuries in greater
numbers. However, female athletes have a 2.4 to almost 10
times greater risk to tear their ACL than males when


-----

competing in the same sport.[18] An ACL injury in most cases
prevents an athlete from returning to sports requiring pivoting or cutting maneuvers. Although many factors can contribute to the timing of an athlete’s return to sports after an
ACL reconstruction, most surgeons prohibit their patients
from returning to at-risk activities for 4 to 6 months.[1,3, 4, 8]

The timing of an ACL reconstruction after an acute
injury is an issue of considerable debate. In a landmark
study, Shelbourne and Patel[19] recommended waiting at
least 3 weeks from injury before proceeding with an ACL
reconstruction because of the risk of arthrofibrosis and
suboptimal clinical results. Several studies subsequently
corroborated this recommendation.[10,20,24] In contradistinction, a few studies have found no loss of motion with surgery performed proximate to injury.[2,12,15,16] Patellar tendon
autografts were used for the ACL reconstructions in nearly
all of these studies. There have been no studies that we
have identified that prospectively evaluated patients with
an acute ACL tear who have been randomized to either
early or late reconstructions using hamstring autografts.
The purpose of this study was to prospectively compare
the postoperative range of motion, stability, and early clinical results in a similar group of young athletes with an
acute ACL tear after randomization to either acute or
delayed surgical reconstruction. Because the primary outcome measure was restoration of normal range of motion,
a minimum of 6 months of follow-up was determined to be
adequate. Although in some patients, some improvement
may still be gained at 6 months, if a patient has regained
their preinjury range of motion, they should be at minimal
risk to lose motion thereafter.

##### METHODS


a full range of motion. Their surgery was scheduled at a
minimum of 6 weeks from the date of injury. The patients
in group 2 were not permitted to return to full active duty
or recreational sports during their rehabilitation before
surgery. If a concomitant MCL injury was present, a
hinged knee brace was prescribed that allowed sagittal
plane motion but limited valgus motion and protected the
medial ligament.


##### Preoperative Assessments


The study was approved by our Institutional Review
Board, and all participants consented to randomization.
Only military patients or their family members were eligible for treatment at our hospital. Patients of at least 18
years of age who were seen with an acute ACL tear were
given the option of participating in the study. An MRI was
obtained on all knees to confirm the diagnosis and provide
additional information regarding meniscal and concomitant ligamentous injuries. Exclusion criteria included any
prior ligamentous surgery on the index knee or a concomitant posterior cruciate, fibular collateral, or posterolateral
corner ligamentous knee injury. Concomitant medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries of any grade were not
exclusionary in either group.
Once an acute ACL tear was diagnosed and the patient
consented to study participation, the patients were randomized to either the early (group 1) or delayed (group 2)
surgery group. Randomization was performed via study
design using sealed envelopes that identified the timing of
surgery to be employed. The patients randomized to group
1 were scheduled for surgery at the earliest possible date.
No exceptions were made for swelling, limitations in range
of knee motion, or pain. Patients randomized to group 2
were enrolled in our physical therapy program, where they
began a supervised rehabilitation protocol that emphasized quadriceps muscle strengthening and restoration of


A thorough history was obtained and a physical examination performed on all patients at their initial evaluation.
Information collected included date and mechanism of
injury, prior knee injuries, and surgery on either knee. A
maximum manual side-to-side KT-1000 arthrometer
(MEDmetric, San Diego, Calif) assessment was conducted
to quantify and to compare the anterior translation in the
injured knee to that of the contralateral knee. A battery of
subjective knee evaluation instruments were completed by
all patients preoperatively and then at 6-month intervals
postoperatively. Specifically the single assessment numeric
evaluation (SANE), Tegner Activity Score, and Lysholm
evaluation were used. The SANE score consists of a single
subjective evaluation score from 1 to 100, where 100 is considered “normal function.”[25] The Lysholm score was originally designed to assess ligament injuries of the knee.[14] The
Lysholm score is a condition-specific instrument that consists of 8 domains: limp, locking, pain, stair climbing, use of
supports, instability, swelling, and squatting. An overall
score of 100 is possible and indicates the highest possible
function. The tabulated scores correspond with the following
outcomes: 95 to 100, excellent; 84 to 94, good; 65 to 83, fair;
and <65, poor.The Tegner Activity Score is a numerical score
from 1 to 10 that subjectively assesses a patient’s current
level of activity, with each number corresponding to participation in sporting activities at various levels.[23] The highest
score of 10 corresponds to participation in sports such as
football, soccer, or rugby at an elite level. A score of 6 corresponds with participation in sports at a recreational level,
and a score of 0 would represent an individual on sick leave
or disability due to his or her knee.


General anesthesia via endotracheal or laryngeal mask was
used in all patients. All knees were examined under anesthesia to assess and to grade ligamentous injuries. All patients
received prophylactic intravenous antibiotics. The operative
time was calculated from the first incision to the closure of all
wounds.An arthroscopic evaluation was first performed in all
patients to assess intra-articular pathoanatomy, to confirm
the ACL tear, and to assess meniscal and chondral injuries as
well as reparability of these injuries.
Meniscal tears were repaired or debrided based on wellestablished criteria,[9,13,21] the primary determinants being
residual rim width and configuration of the tear. Using an
inside-out technique as described by Bottoni and Arciero,[6]

all meniscal repairs were performed using double-armed
nonabsorbable meniscal sutures (0 Ethibond Ethicon Inc


##### Operative Technique

Somerville, NJ) in a vertical mattress configuration.
Meniscal debridement, when repair was not feasible, was
performed with a disposable shaver (4.0-mm Tomcat,
Stryker Endoscopy, San Jose, Calif).
Chondral injuries were graded according to the modified
Outerbridge classification[7] and documented. The depth
and size of the articular cartilage injury determined its
classification. The more superficial injuries (grades I and
II) and the more extensive lesions (grades IIII and IV)
were combined for study evaluations. Any loose chondral
flaps were debrided.

##### ACL Reconstruction Technique


rehabilitation closely supervised within our military physical therapy system. Our rehabilitation protocol emphasizes early mobilization and maintenance of extension.
Slight modifications by the therapists were permitted
based on each patient’s individual progress. For patients
with meniscal repair or microfracture, partial weightbearing with crutches for 4 weeks was mandated. The drop-lock
brace applied in the operating room was used continuously
for 4 to 6 weeks until good quadriceps control was restored.
Subsequently, no functional bracing was used for any
patient. Return to sports or full active military duty was
permitted at 4 to 6 months depending on individual
progress.


All knees were reconstructed using a quadrupled hamstrings
autograft.The technique used was described by Bottoni.[5] The
gracilis and semitendinosus tendons were harvested through
a vertical incision over the pes anserinus. The tendons were
released from the tibia together, secured with a heavy-gauge
nonabsorbable suture (#5 Ethibond, Ethicon Inc), and then
stripped to the musculotendinous junctions with an openended tendon stripper (Tendon Harvester, Linvatec Corporation, Largo, Fla). All remaining muscle was removed
from the tendons, and then the free ends were secured with
a locking Krackow stitch of #5 Ethibond. The quadrupled
tendons were sized and placed on 15 lb of tension
(GraftMaster, Smith & Nephew, Andover, Mass) until needed
for the ACL reconstruction.
Soft tissue was debrided using a disposable shaver (5.5mm Tomcat, Stryker Endoscopy) and bipolar electrocautery
device (TurboVac 90, Arthrocare Corporation, Sunnyvale,
Calif) to allow for visualization of the over-the-top position.
The posterior aspect of the tibial footprint of the ACL was
used to determine the proper position for the tibial tunnel. A
tibial guide set at 65° (Arthrex Inc, Naples, Fla) was used to
ensure proper orientation of the femoral tunnel as described
by Howell et al.[11] A femoral tunnel was created using a 5-mm
over-the-top guide (Arthrex Inc) using a transtibial technique. The graft was secured on the femoral side with a 50mm metallic cross pin (TransFix, Arthrex Inc). The graft was
secured with a resorbable interference screw (Full Thread
Bio-Interference Screw, Arthrex Inc) that was the same
diameter as the tibial tunnel. The knee was placed at 20° to
30° of flexion and a posterior force applied to the tibia while
securing the graft on the tibial side. In all cases, the tibial fixation was augmented by a 6.5-mm screw and spiked washer.
The knee was then examined to ensure elimination of the
anterior tibial laxity. All incisions were closed with subcutaneous interrupted absorbable sutures and a subcuticular
skin closure (2-0 Vicryl and 4-0 Monocryl, Ethicon Inc).
Cryotherapy via a compression sleeve (Cryo/Cuff, Aircast/
DJO, Vista, Calif) was applied over a thigh-high compressive
stocking (TED hose, Kendall-LTP, Chicopee, Mass). The knee
was immobilized in a brace locked in extension (Telescoping
Cool ELS, DJO).

##### Postoperative Rehabilitation


##### Postoperative Evaluations


All patients were evaluated at 3 days, 2 weeks, and then
monthly during the first 6 months postoperatively.
Thereafter, patients were evaluated every 6 months. Passive
range of motion knee measurements were recorded using a
goniometer and compared with the patient’s nonoperative
side. A physical therapist who was not part of the surgical
team performed all range of motion and stability measurements. Allowing gravity as the only force, passive extension was recorded while the patient was prone. The
measurements were then compared with those of the
uninvolved knee. Subjective evaluations were made using
established outcome measures at the postoperative visits.
SANE, Tegner Activity Score, and Lysholm evaluation
scores were used.


##### Statistical Analysis


Descriptive statistics were summarized for subject demographic data. The SANE scores were analyzed with a 2 × 2
(group × time) analysis of variance with repeated measures for time. The Lysholm and Tegner Activity scores were
analyzed with separate independent _t tests. Differences_
between groups regarding postoperative range of motion
were also analyzed with separate independent _t tests._
Alpha level for all statistical tests was set at .05. Microsoft
Excel (Office 2000, Microsoft, Redmond, Wash) and SPSS
for Windows (version 11.5) software (SPSS Science Inc,
Chicago, Ill) were used for statistical analysis.


##### RESULTS


Postoperatively, patients from both groups followed the
same closely supervised rehabilitation protocol. All


Seventy consecutive patients with an acute ACL tear were
enrolled in our study (Figure 1). By study design, they
were evenly split between the acute and delayed surgery
groups. Fifty-eight were men, and the average age was 27
years (range, 18-43). Noncontact, pivoting injuries during
sports participation accounted for the majority (70%) of the
ACL tears. There were no statistically significant differences between groups for all demographic characteristics
(Table 1). The mean time from injury to surgery was 9 days
(range, 2-18) in the early group and 85 days (range, 42-192)
in the delayed group. Based on the established criteria, no
patients were excluded for prior knee surgery on the index
knee, a multiligamentous knee injury, or locked knee due

study criteria and underwent an acute ACL reconstruction
(group 1) was dropped after he sustained a postoperative
intra-articular infection that necessitated graft removal.
There were no other perioperative complications. Two
patients (2.9%), 1 from each group, sustained a traumatic
retear of their ACL graft. One patient sustained a reinjury
at 8 months playing basketball and the other at 11 months
during military training. Both of these patients had
returned to full military duty and recreational sports
before their reinjuries. As these patients were available for
follow-up evaluations for a minimum of 6 months, their
range of motion and clinical scores are included until they
sustained their reinjury. Follow-up for all patients averaged 1 year (range, 180-708 days).
Chondral injuries were found in a minority of the
patients. Nine of the knees in group 1 (25%) and 5 of the
knees in group 2 (14%) had chondral injuries. None of these
injuries required microfracture. The specific locations and
classification of these lesions are listed in Table 2.
Meniscal tears were found in 32 of the knees in group 1
(91%) and 24 of the knees in group 2 (69%). Of the 32 tears


in the acute group, 18 (56%) were found in the lateral
meniscus and none were reparable. Most of these were
small radial posterior horn injuries. Of the 14 tears in the
medial meniscus in knees of group 1, 8 (57%) were reparable. In contrast, of the 15 medial meniscal tears in the
knees from group 2, only 4 (27%) were reparable. These
data are shown in Table 3.
The average postoperative range of motion loss as measured by the deficits in flexion and extension compared with
the contralateral knee is shown in Table 4. There was only
1 patient in the delayed group and none in the early group
with >10° loss of extension. If that outlier was dropped, the
extension deficit would be 0.8° compared with 0.6° average
loss in the acute group. There were 2 patients in the
delayed group and 1 patient in the early surgery group
who had 5° to 10° loss of extension. There were only 2
patients in the delayed group and 1 in the early group with
>10° loss of flexion. There were 5 patients in the delayed
group and 5 patients in the early surgery group who had
5° to 10° loss of flexion. There were no statistically
significant differences in extension or flexion deficits

##### DISCUSSION

In this study, our primary objective was to compare the postoperative knee motion and stability after reconstruction in 2
groups of young athletic patients with an acute tear of the
ACL. Half the patients were randomized to receive their surgery acutely and the others delayed. We purposefully did not
exclude patients based on clinical criteria such as limited
preoperative range of motion or persistent hemarthrosis,
both of which, if present, have been identified as criteria to
delay surgery. By not preselecting those patients with an optimal condition for knee surgery and thus biasing our results,
we sought to determine whether reconstructing the ACL in
an acutely injured knee, irrespective of its preoperative status, would be problematic with regard to postoperative


-----

motion or clinical outcome. To the contrary, we found those
patients reconstructed early quickly regained their preinjury range of motion and, subjectively, felt better faster. We
believe that the reason for this is the theory of a “second
hit.” If the surgery is performed proximate to the injury,
the body has just one “trauma” from which to heal. In contradistinction, when the surgery is delayed, the knee
recovers from the first injury. The hemarthrosis resolves,
and motion is restored. However, the subsequent surgery is
then perceived by the body as a “second hit” from which
healing must again commence.
The concept of a cyclops lesion as a cause of arthrofibrosis is also, in our opinion, flawed. As long as any residual
stump of the torn ACL is adequately resected, no tissue
should remain that blocks extension. In our experience,
any loss of active extension noted preoperatively was due
to a limitation secondary to pain. In nearly all cases, on initiation of anesthesia, full knee motion was demonstrated.
Our emphasis on extension immediately postoperatively
prevented loss of terminal hyperextension in either the
early or delayed surgical group in the vast majority of our
patients. The 1 patient with the greatest loss of motion
postoperatively was randomized to the delayed group.
Preoperatively, she had difficulty regaining her full
motion. Despite regaining full extension and flexion at surgery, she had a difficult time in maintaining her full range
of motion postoperatively. Despite aggressive physical
therapy, she ended up with a significant loss of extension
and a suboptimal clinical result. This patient may have
had a fibrotic diathesis and experienced difficulty with
postoperative range of motion irrespective of when she
underwent reconstruction.
The landmark study by Shelbourne et al[22] is the primary
source for the recommendation to delay an ACL reconstruction by at least 3 weeks. This work was a retrospective review of 169 ACL reconstructions followed for 13
weeks. They stratified the patients based on the time from
injury to surgery. Group I was less than 8 days; group II, 8
to 21 days; and group III, >21 days. The authors reported a
significantly increased incidence of arthrofibrosis in
patients reconstructed acutely (group I) when compared
with those reconstructed at 21 days or longer (group III).
The authors also reported that an accelerated rehabilitation program resulted in significantly less arthrofibrosis in
group II patients than when a slower rehabilitation protocol was employed. In designing our protocol, we used their
study as our model. However, several salient differences
are apparent. Shelbourne et al used an ipsilateral bonetendon-bone autograft inserted via a mini-open, 2-incision
technique. The graft was secured on both the femoral and
tibial sides with heavy sutures tied over a polypropylene
ligament button. In contrast, we used an autograft hamstring via a single-incision arthroscopic technique.
Theoretically, the additional trauma from the arthrotomy
in the mini-open technique could have contributed to the
increased arthrofibrosis reported in their study. Shelbourne
et al did not perform any concomitant meniscal repairs in any
of their patients requiring ACL reconstructions. Additionally,
only some of their patients were rehabilitated with an accelerated protocol with an emphasis on extension and early
t ti f ti Th ti t t t d b t 8


and 21 days (group II) fared significantly better when this
“more accelerated” protocol was employed.
Our early group was defined as a reconstruction within
21 days of injury (Shelbourne et al’s groups I and II), but
our goal was to perform the surgery as soon as possible.
Our average time from injury to surgery in our early group
was 9 days. Moreover, nearly half (15 of 34) of the patients
in this early group had their reconstruction within a week
of their injury (equivalent to group I in Shelbourne et al’s
study). Only a few of these patients demonstrated any loss
of flexion or extension.
One theoretical advantage of early surgery is a faster
return to full activities. Patients in group 1, whose surgery
was performed acutely, were able to return to sports earlier
because there was no initial delay in beginning their rehabilitation. Another theoretical advantage of an early reconstruction is the avoidance of further meniscal or chondral
injuries that may occur if an athlete returns to some level of
activities with an ACL-deficient knee. Wasilewski et al[24]

reported a significantly higher incidence of chondral injuries
(44% vs 17%) in knees that underwent delayed ACL reconstruction compared with those performed acutely. However,
they reported a higher incidence of meniscal tears in their
acute group. This correlates with our findings of a high incidence of posterior horn lateral meniscal tears noted in our
acute group (18 vs 9). However, most of these were small
radial tears that required minimal debridement. None of the
knees in the acute group required lateral meniscal repairs,
compared with 2 that required repairs in the delayed group.
Although the incidence of medial meniscal tears was comparable (14 vs 15), twice as many (8 vs 4) of these medial
meniscal tears were reparable in the acute group. The delay
in surgery and probable increased trauma sustained by the
meniscus could account for the inability to repair these
meniscal tears.
Relatively low subjective outcome scores were found for
patients in both the acute and delayed groups. The average
Lysholm scores for both groups categorize the results as fair.
The scores are consistent across different outcome instruments. We believe the reason for the relatively low scores is
the relatively short clinical follow-up (<2 years, as is standard for clinical outcome studies) and possibly the expectations of the servicemen and servicewomen that make up our
study population.The high demands placed on these patients
and the activities required magnify any limitation in function. The subjective evaluation scores obtained for comparison are considered inadequate for clinical comparisons and
thus should not be used as such. Our primary objective was
to ascertain the patients’ assessment of their progress.
One limitation of our study is the fact that none of the
patients in our acute group were given the chance to demonstrate that they could have functioned without an ACL reconstruction. Our justification, however, is that the activities
required of active duty servicemen and servicewomen, in the
vast majority of cases, preclude functioning with an ACLdeficient knee. In addition, the inability of junior enlisted personnel to make autonomous decisions as to their activity level
precludes a “wait and see” approach. They are expected to
participate in training and unit sporting activities unless
given specific limitations defined in a “medical profile” writt b h i i h i i ’ i t t A d t ll


-----

have found that those who continue to attempt to perform at
the high level required of an active duty service member
with an ACL-deficient knee often do considerably more
damage to their knees before their reconstruction.
The results from this study in a military population may
not be applicable to a community orthopaedic practice. The
captive population and relatively quick referrals allowed us
to perform surgery acutely. Additionally, the military population allowed us to adequately protect those patients in the
delayed group from resuming activities that may have
resulted in further injury to their ACL-deficient knees.
Another limitation is the relatively short postoperative
follow-up. However, unlike clinical outcome studies, our primary outcome measure was postoperative range of motion.
We chose 6 months as a minimum period of follow-up. Because
most patients return to sports at or before this time, any postoperative motion gained by this point should not be lost
unless another injury occurs. Although some improvement in
range of motion could be feasible after 6 months, it is not
likely in most cases. Shelbourne et al reported their results at
3 months (13 weeks) postoperatively when it was conceivable
that additional improvement could still be achieved. Using
similar logic, laxity assessments using KT-1000 arthrometer
side-to-side measurements taken at 6 months should not
change unless reinjury occurs.
Another difference of our study from the study of
Shelbourne et al was that we used autograft hamstring
tendons and they used autograft bone–patellar tendon–
bone grafts. The fixation techniques were also different.
However, all patients in both studies were treated with the
same graft. Therefore, the dependent variable was the timing of the surgery.
Our study demonstrated that comparable knee flexion and
extension can be achieved with either early or delayed surgical reconstruction of a torn ACL. Our early results do not
demonstrate any clinical differences in postoperative range
of motion, stability, or early subjective outcome measures
between knees reconstructed acutely or those that are
delayed. Although we do not recommend that the ACL
should be reconstructed acutely, our study demonstrates that
surgery need not be delayed to obtain satisfactory clinical
results. We believe that it is permissible to proceed with an
ACL reconstruction soon after injury and delaying the surgery for some arbitrary period of time is not necessary.
