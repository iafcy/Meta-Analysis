Abstract 
Purpose To compare acute ACL reconstruction (ACLR) within 8 days of injury with delayed reconstruction after normalized 
range of motion (ROM), 6–10 weeks after injury. It was hypothesized that acute ACL reconstruction with modern techniques 
is safe and can be beneficial in terms of patient-reported outcomes and range of motion. 
Methods The effect of acute and delayed ACLR was randomized studied on 70 patients with high recreational activity level, 
Tegner level 6 or more, between 2006 and 2013. Patient-reported outcomes, objective IKDC, KOOS, and manual stability 
measurements were documented during the 24-month follow-up period. 
Results The acute ACLR group did not result in increased stiffness and showed superior outcome regarding strength and how 
the patient felt their knee functioning at 24 months. In addition, the acute group was not inferior to the delayed group in any 
assessment. Regarding patient-related outcomes in KOOS, both groups showed significant improvements in all subscales, 
but no difference was found between the groups. Functional return (FR) rate was almost double compared to the Swedish 
knee ligament register and treatment failure (TF) rate was reduced by half, no significant difference between the groups. 
No difference regarding cyclops removal, re-injury of ACL or meniscus was found between the two surgical timing groups. 
Conclusion Acute ACLR within 8 days of injury does not appear to adversely affect ROM or result in increased stiffness in 
the knee joint and was not inferior to the delayed group in any assessment when compared to delayed surgery. 
Level of evidence I. 


Acute anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture is a common 
and serious injury to the knee. The incidence in Sweden 
is close to 80/100,000 inhabitants, with non-contact ACL 
injuries most commonly occurring in athletes who partici- 
pate in pivoting sports such as soccer, handball, and alpine 
skiing [33]. Though it has been established that ACL recon- 
struction (ACLR) decreases pathological knee laxity and 
reduces episodes of instability [13, 20, 29], many patients 
never return to their pre-injury activity level. In addition, 
irrespective of how the injury is treated, many patients later

develop osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and studies com- 
paring long-term outcomes following ACLR compared to 
non-operative treatment have not demonstrated consistent 
results [12, 13, 16]. 
While it is generally agreed that ACLR is indicated for 
patients with signs of instability and a desire to resume a 
high activity level in pivoting sports, the optimal timing of 
ACLR has not yet been determined. The current recommen- 
dation is to delay ACLR after an acute injury due to the risk 
of arthrofibrosis and suboptimal clinical results [28, 37]. 
However, several studies have shown similar postoperative 
range of motion (ROM) regardless of whether surgery was 
performed within 48 h, 2 weeks, or if ACLR was delayed 
for a minimum of 6 weeks [1, 10, 17, 22, 30]. Early ACLR 
can facilitate early return to sport and work, and has been 
reported to be more cost effective, while increased time 
between injury and surgical intervention is associated with 



 


increased incidence of meniscus and cartilage injuries [9, 
20, 23, 34]. 
In an initial study, involving patients with high activity 
levels, compared outcomes following ACLR performed 
within 8 days of injury to surgery 6–10-week postinjury and 
demonstrated no significant differences in ROM at 6-month 
follow-up [10]. In this study, outcomes for the two groups 
were assessed at a minimum of 24-month post-surgery. It 
was hypothesized that an acute ACLR would not result in 
inferior patient-reported outcomes nor a higher frequency 
of ROM deficits. 

Active adults between 18 and 40 years of age who presented 
to the Orthopaedics Department of Stockholm South Hospi- 
tal with an acute ACL rupture in a previously healthy knee 
were enrolled in the study. Exclusion criteria were: Tegner 
activity level [35] below level 6, major cartilage or menis- 
cus injury on MRI requiring acute surgery, signs of OA on 
acute radiograph, a medial collateral ligament injury grade 
2 or more, or multiple ligament injuries. During this period, 
2,088 patients were assessed and 70 patients were included 
and randomized with the sealed envelope technique. One 
patient in the delayed group dropped out before surgery due 
to personal reasons. In an intial study, the details of recruit- 
ment process, full inclusion and exclusion criteria, patient 
demographics, and the randomization process have previ- 
ously been published [10]. All patients provided written 
informed consent prior to study participation. 
All reconstructions were performed using anatomical 
single-bundle hamstring grafts and all patients underwent 
a standardized rehabilitation protocol at one physiotherapy 
center, with full weight bearing allowed from day 1. 

Demographic data were obtained at baseline and included 
patient age, gender, injured side, time from injury to surgery, 
and concomitant injuries. Knee injury and osteoarthritis out- 
come score (KOOS) [26], Lysholm score [35] and Tegner 
activity level were obtained preoperatively. Patient-reported 
Tegner activity level refers prior to injury was also recorded. 
Preoperative examination was completed with a physi- 
cal examination, including ROM (passive ROM measured 
with a goniometer and reported as a deficit in extension and 
flexion), instrumented laxity using the Rolimeter and thigh- 
circumference measured 10 cm proximal to the proximal 
pole of the patella. Follow-up examinations were performed 
at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively and included the 
same scores as preoperatively as well as functional strength 
test assessed with the single leg hop. Isokinetic peak torque 
strength at 60°, 180°, and 240°/s, and isometric torque 
strength at 60° and 180°, in both extension and flexion was 
measured with Biodex®. ACL graft failures, contralateral 
ACL ruptures and meniscal repair failures requiring revision 
meniscus surgery were recorded. 
The study was approved by the regional ethics committee 
at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Sweden (reference no. 
2006/404-31/3/2008/1541-32). 

Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS 
25.0 software package for Macintosh. Nominal variables 
were tested by the χ2 test or the Fisher’s exact test. Ordinal 
variables and non-normally distributed interval and scale 
variables were evaluated by the Mann–Whitney U test, and 
the Student’s t test was used for normally distributed scale 
variables in independent groups. Longitudinal statistics were 
done with the paired-samples t test for normally distributed 
scale variables and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for ordi- 
nal and non-normally distributed scale variables. The tests 
were two-sided. The results were considered significant at 
p < 0.05. 
A sample size calculation was performed using the pri- 
mary outcome variable ROM at 3 months. If the mean dif- 
ference between the groups was 5° or more (corresponding 
to means of 122.5 vs. 117.5) and the common within-group 
standard deviation was 7.0, a sample size of 32 patients in 
each of the two groups would have a power of 80% to yield 
a statistically significant result, with 5% risk of a type-one 
error. 

Demographic data of the study groups are displayed in 
Table 1. The only significant difference between group I 
(acute reconstruction) and group II (delayed reconstruction) 
was the time between injury and reconstruction. Despite 
several attempts to contact all patients by both mail and tel- 
ephone, not all patients attended the 2-year clinical visit. 
Twelve (17%) patients were lost to follow-up, with no sig- 
nificant difference between groups I and II. 

As shown in Table 2 and Fig. 1, no difference in patient- 
related outcome score was found. Lysholm, KOOS, and Teg- 
ner showed no statistically significant differences between 
the acute and delayed treatment groups. Median Tegner level 
was restored to pre-injury and desired levels in both groups, 
with almost all patients returning to Tegner activity level 6 
or higher, i.e., knee-strenuous sports.

ACL anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction 
Patient demographics at baseline for patients who underwent ACLR 
are displayed as mean ± SD, number and percentage, respectively. 
Statistical significant (p < 0.05) values were only seen for the time 
from injury to reconstruction 


Similar results were found in the groups regarding muscle 
circumference and functional strength measured with the 
one leg hop test. However, significant differences were found 
in isokinetic flexion between groups during the Biodex test, 
Table 2. Values in the acute group were significantly higher 
for the flexor muscles at 180° and 240°/s, by 8.1% (p = 0.05) 
and 9.4% (p = 0.01), respectively. The other strength assess- 
ments performed were not statistically different, although 
higher values were found for group I. 

There was additional surgery in six cases (18%) of the acute 
group and 13 (37%) of the delayed (n.s.), Table 3. One 
patient in each group sustained a graft rupture during the 
study period and both reported a new significant trauma. 
Arthroscopic removal of a cyclops lesion was necessary in 
6 patients in the delayed group and one in the acute. 


Functional recovery was defined as a Knee Osteoarthritis 
Outcome Score (KOOS) above: 90 for Pain, 84 for Symp- 
toms, 91 for ADL, 80 for Sport/Rec, and 81 for quality of 
life (QoL). TF was defined as a KOOS, QoL < 44 [4]. No 
significant difference between the groups, almost 40% in 
each group achieved FR, was found. 

The overall objective IKDC as well as manual laxity 
measurements did not display any significant differences 
between the acute and delayed surgery patients. It also 
showed high scores in both groups, with almost all patients 
within grade AB (normal to nearly normal), as presented 
in Table 2. 

The distribution of range of motion scores according to 
deficits in flexion and extension at 24 months in the study 
groups is presented in Table 2. No statistically significant 
difference was found between the acute and delayed treat- 
ment groups in patients with an isolated ACL tear. The 
patients with an extension deficit at 3-month follow-up 
had regained their ROM by 24 months, i.e., those found 
to have an extension deficit at 24 months had lost ROM 
subsequent to the 3-month follow-up. 
The most important finding of this randomized control trial 
is that good clinical results can be achieved 24 months after 
acute ACLR and that early extension deficits seen at the 
3-month follow-up had resolved. 
This study supports the findings of other recent studies 
which have demonstrated that the timing of ACLR does not 
influence postoperative ROM [1, 7, 10, 17, 24] and con- 
tradicts the findings of older studies including Shelbourne 
et al. [25, 28, 37]. These differences may be due to the fact 
that these older studies were performed without the use 
of contemporary arthroscopic techniques, were retrospec- 
tive, and perhaps most importantly had a more restrictive 
postoperative rehabilitation regime. In addition, a lack of 
classification in the literature regarding which timeframe 
constitutes acute vs. delayed surgery makes it difficult to 
compare these studies [11]. In this study, acute reconstruc- 
tion did not result in increased stiffness. There were superior 
outcomes for the acute group regarding strength and how the 
patient perceived their knee function at 24 months. In addi- 
tion, the acute group was not inferior to the delayed group 
in any assessment. Regarding patient-related outcomes in 
KOOS, both groups showed significant improvements in all 
subscales, but no difference was found between the groups. 
The KOOS results were also slightly better than those from 
the Swedish anterior cruciate ligament registry [2] and the 
results from a US cohort study [32]. This further supports 
the fact that acute ACLR is a safe option. 
Non-operative treatment of an ACL injury remains 
an option and can yield satisfactory results [13, 15, 31],

although the body of evidence is limited due to the scar- 
city of randomized studies. Frobell et al. concluded that 
for adults with acute ACL injuries, there is no difference 
between surgical management (ACL reconstruction fol- 
lowed by structured rehabilitation) and non-operative treat- 
ment (structured rehabilitation only) in patient‐reported 
outcomes of knee function at 2 and 5 years after injury. 
However, nearly, 50% of the participants with an ACL rup- 
ture remained symptomatic following rehabilitation and later 
opted for ACL reconstruction surgery [13]. 
An association between the time from injury to surgery 
and the risk of additional medial meniscal injuries and chon- 
dral injuries has been reported by several studies investigat- 
ing ACL injuries [4–6, 19]. Chhadia et al. found a signifi- 
cant association between medial meniscal injury, as well as 
medial and lateral compartment chondral injury, and delayed 
surgery (beyond 6 and 12 months) [8]. With the increased 
risk for further injuries, it is questionable whether initial 
non-operative treatment in patients with a high pre-injury 
activity level is the best alternative. 
Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is com- 
monly recommended for patients who participate in 
pivoting sports and aspire to return to pre-injury sports 
participation. The rates of return to pre-injury level of 
sport following ACLR differ between studies and between 
elite and non-elite athletes (83% vs. 63%) [3, 21]. Using 
pre-injury level of sport as a measure of successful surgery 
may not accurately reflect positive outcomes, for example, 
patients with pre-injury Tegner levels of ten who subse- 
quently return to a score of eight. The study confirms that 
while not all patients did return to pre-injury level of sport, 
almost all could return to a knee-strenuous sport. No sig- 
nificant difference between the groups in this regard was 
found, but it was noted that fewer had returned in the acute 
group. A further in-depth analysis of these acutely oper- 
ated patients who did not return to knee-strenuous sport 
found that they did not demonstrate inferior outcomes in 
any subjective or objective assessment when compared 
to patients who returned to their previous activity level. 
Furthermore, the FR and TR did not differ between those 
who returned and those who did not. KOOS also showed 
higher score in sport/req, even though fewer returned to 
the same Tegner levels. As such, it is unclear why they 
did not return to their previous level. As this study was 
not designed specifically to look at return to sport, one 
explanation of this finding could be a type 2 error, due to

The FR rate was almost double that seen in a previous 
study found in the Swedish Knee Ligament Register (SKLR) 
[4]. Although waiting time itself does not have an impact 
on the outcome, it can be argued that an acute or early 
ACLR, which is performed before recurrent giving ways 
occur, increases the likelihood of achieving FR. The study 
also showed that TF was reduced by half in the acute group 
compared to the SKLR. This suggests early surgery, before 
recurring giving ways have occurred, decreases additional 
injuries, and increases the likelihood of FR. Finally, it should 
be mentioned that an acute ACLR has been shown to be 
more cost-effective than delayed surgery, and time spent on

rehabilitation before the surgery is better utilized postopera- 
tively [23, 27, 36]. 
The major strength of this study is its prospective, rand- 
omized design and the use of the same surgical technique. 
Furthermore, one center with the same postoperative reha- 
bilitation protocol was used in both groups. The two groups 
were also comparable in terms of age, gender and pre-injury 
Tegner activity level, factors which could contribute to 
selection bias in a non-randomized trial. 
Potential limitations are the limited number of patients. 
Though there were sufficient numbers according to the 
power analysis for the primary endpoint, there may not have 
been enough patients included to detect other significant 
differences. A further limitation was the change in surgical 
method during the study period (transtibial vs. femoral por- 
tal drilling). Furthermore, there were a relative high number 
of patients who were lost to the latest follow-up, although 
with no difference between the groups. 

This study provides further evidence that acute ACL recon- 
struction can be performed safely without an increased risk 
of developing stiffness. Thus, clinicians can make their deci- 
sion about the optimal time for surgery for each individual 
patient based on other parameters and plan acute reconstruc- 
tion if indicated.
