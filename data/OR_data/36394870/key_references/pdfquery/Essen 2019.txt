Abstract 
Purpose To compare the total number of sick-leave days caused by the knee injury from the day of injury and over the first 
year between acute (within 8 days) and delayed (6–10 weeks) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and also 
assess other clinical outcomes during this period. 
Methods Seventy patients with an acute ACL injury and Tegner level of 6 or more were randomized to acute (within 8 days) 
or delayed (after 6–10 weeks) ACLR. Patient-reported outcomes; objective IKDC and manual stability measurements were 
assessed at 6 and 12 months. With data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan) information about 
the number of sick-leave days due to the knee injury over the following 12 months was collected and compared between the 
two groups. 
Results Seventy-one percent received compensation for sick leave (26 in the acute versus 23 in the delayed group). The 
mean number of sick-leave days for the acute group was significantly lower (M = 56.9, SD = 36.4) compared to the delayed 
group (M = 88.5, SD = 50.2), p < 0.05. The acute group was also significantly stronger in flexion in both slow and fast angle 
velocities according to Biodex®. No other differences were found between the groups in other clinical assessments or in 
terms of associated injuries. 
Conclusion Acute and delayed ACLR provided comparable clinical outcomes after 12 months. Acute reconstruction resulted 
in less sick-leave days and as such fewer indirect costs to the individual and society. These findings suggest that if patients 
requiring ACLR can be identified early and ACLR can be performed in the acute phase, socioeconomic costs can potentially 
be reduced by minimizing time off work. 
Level of evidence II. 


A rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a seri- 
ous knee injury most commonly affecting young, physically 
active persons. In both male and female athletes, ACL injury 
is the most frequent cause of permanent disability [1]. The 
incidence of ACL injury is around 7000 cases per year in 
Sweden with approximately 3500 ACL reconstructions 
(ACLR) performed annually [2].

ACL injuries may be managed non-operatively with 
physical therapy and activity modification or with surgical 
reconstruction of the ligament. Although conservative treat- 
ment can be successful in some patient groups [3], it has 
been proven less successful in physically active patients who 
compete or train at a high level [4–6]. 
The optimal timing of surgery has been debated [7–10], 
with surgical reconstruction traditionally delayed for at 
least 6 weeks due to evidence that earlier reconstruction 
may increase the risk of developing arthrofibrosis [11–13]. 
However, recent studies have demonstrated that with newer 
surgical techniques, surgery may be performed in the acute 
phase following the injury without significantly increasing 
the risk of complications [8–10]. 



 


An ACL injury is functionally disabling and may pre- 
dispose the knee to further injuries, such as chondral and 
meniscal injury, while also contributing to early onset of 
degenerative changes in the knee [1, 14–18]. In addition to 
potentially reducing these risks, surgery in the acute phase 
following injury may facilitate earlier return to work, result- 
ing in socioeconomic benefits to both society and the indi- 
vidual. There is currently conflicting evidence regarding 
the socioeconomic costs of acute versus delayed surgery, 
with two recent studies finding early ACLR to be more cost- 
effective than delayed surgery [19, 20] and another finding 
the opposite to be true [21]. 
In Sweden patients are entitled to paid sick leave if a 
doctor determines that work is not possible due to illness 
or injury, with up to 80% of income reimbursed. Costs are 
covered by the patient’s employer during the first 2 weeks 
of leave and subsequently by the government. 
The primary aim of this study was to compare the total 
number of sick-leave days taken following ACL rupture 
in those undergoing acute and delayed reconstruction, as 
a means of measuring socioeconomic cost. The secondary 
aim was to compare early functional outcomes between the 
groups. It was hypothesized that an acute ACLR results 
in lesser sick-leave days without inferior patient-reported 
outcomes. 

From 2006 to 2013, 2088 patients who had presented to the 
emergency department with an acute knee injury were fol- 
lowed up within 3 days at a knee clinic. Clinical examination 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. If 
an ACL rupture was diagnosed and the patient consented to 
participation, they were assessed for inclusion in the study. 
The inclusion criteria for the study were: unilateral primary 
ACL injury in patients between 18 and 40 years of age with 
no previous knee injury to either leg, Tegner activity level 
[22] minimum 6, no additional meniscus or cartilage dam- 
age on MRI indicating the need for major acute meniscus 
or cartilage surgery, logistic availability to reconstruct the 
patient within 8 days of injury, no MCL-injury greater than 
grade 1 and no LCL-injury in need of surgery. 
If all the pre-requisites were fulfilled, a research nurse 
performed randomization with the sealed envelope technique 
in the same session. Patient demographics are presented in 
Table 1. The patients were prospectively randomized to 
reconstruction of the ACL either within 8 days from injury 
or with delayed reconstruction after recovery of range of 
motion (ROM), within 6–10 weeks from injury. The patients 
randomized to delayed surgery received pre-operative physi- 
otherapy to restore normal range of movement and to pre- 
serve muscle strength. 
At the time of inclusion and randomization the patients 
were evaluated regarding ROM (passive ROM measured 
with a goniometer and reported as a deficit in extension and 
flexion), instrumented laxity using the Rolimeter and thigh 
circumference measured 10 cm proximal to the proximal 
pole of the patella. Subjective and self-assessed IKDC [23], 
KOOS [24], Lysholm [22] and Tegner activity level were 
also evaluated. 



All patients underwent an arthroscopic ACLR with a ham- 
string tendon autograft. If the single semitendinosus tendon 
was not sufficient in length or thickness, the gracilis ten- 
don was also harvested. In the beginning of the study the 
tibia was drilled first and transtibial drilling of the femur 
was used. The tibia angle was 45°–50° depending on the 
surgeon’s preferences, and a femur entry-point at 10 or 2 
o’clock was preferred. Later in the study, due to the evolu- 
tion of surgical technique at the time, the method for tunnel 
placement was changed. Drilling of the femoral tunnel was 
done through the anteromedial portal and the aim was to 
place the tunnel in the centre of the native footprint. The 
graft was fixed in the femur with an Endobutton continu- 
ous loop® (Smith & Nephew, Inc., Andover, MA 01810, 
USA). In the tibia the graft was fixed with a metal interfer- 
ence-screw, RCI® (Smith & Nephew, Inc., Andover, MA 
01810, USA) or Soft Screw® (Arthrex Inc., Naples, Florida 
34108, USA). As an additional reinforcement the graft was 
fixed with an osteo-suture over a “bone-bridge” in the tibia. 
Injured menisci were sutured if an injury was discovered 
during the surgery. 

The rehabilitation was standardized to one physiotherapy 
centre and the same rehabilitation protocol was used for all 
patients. Closed-chain exercises and range of motion train- 
ing was initiated within 1 week after the surgery. Open chain 
exercises were allowed after 6 weeks, running allowed after 
14 weeks and resumption of sport activity after Biodex® 
testing showed 90% strength in injured leg compared to the 
contralateral leg, but never earlier than 6 months. 

At 3 months ROM and circumference of the thighs were 
assessed by the patient’s physiotherapist. An independent 
physiotherapist not involved in the rehabilitation assessed 
the patients at 6 and 12 months.

The follow-up at 6 and 12 months included the same 
subjective scores as pre-operatively as well as ROM, cir- 
cumference of the thighs and single leg hop. Isokinetic 
peak torque strength at 60°/s, 180°/s and 240°/s, and iso- 
metric torque strength at 60° and 180°, in both extension 
and flexion was measured with Biodex® [25]. 
The number of sick-leave days claimed by each patient 
within the first 12 months from the injury was obtained 
from the government agency responsible for sick-leave 
payments (Swedish Social Insurance Agency-SSIA, 
http://www.forsa kring skass an.se). Only sick-leave days 
based on a diagnosis of ACL injury were included. 
The study was approved by the regional ethics commit- 
tee at the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm Sweden (refer- 
ence no. 2006/404-31/3/2008/1541-32). 

Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS 22.0 
software package for Macintosh. Nominal variables were 
tested by the χ2 test or the Fisher exact test. Ordinal variables 
and non-normality distributed interval and ratio scale varia- 
bles were evaluated by the Mann–Whitney U test. Student’s t 
test was used for normally distributed interval and ratio scale 
variables in independent groups. Longitudinal statistics were 
done with the paired-samples t test for normally distributed 
scale variables and the Wilcoxon signed rank test for ordinal 
and non-normality distributed scale variables. The tests were 
2-sided. The results were considered significant at p < 0.05.

motion in the knee; hence students and patients who did not

Patient demographics at baseline for patients who underwent ACLR 
are displayed as mean ± SD, number and percentage, respectively. 
Statistically significant (p < 0.05) values were only seen for the time 
from injury to reconstruction 

register for sick leave were not excluded. Furthermore, no 
power analysis regarding differences in days of sick leave 
was performed prior to study commencement, a post hoc 
power analysis using G*Power 3.1.9.2 (Franz Paul, Kiel, 
Germany) was used to determine the power of the present 
study. Based on number and the distribution of sick-leave 
days at 1 year in the study population, an effect size of 0.73 
was calculated, with α set at 0.05 and 2-sided tests, the 
power of the study was calculated to 71%. 

Seventy patients were included, with 35 patients randomized 
to early ACLR and 35 patients to late reconstruction. One 
patient from the delayed group dropped out before surgery 
due to personal reasons, a second was excluded as they were 
unable to participate in follow-up according to the study 
protocol (Fig. 1). 
Demographic data of the study groups are displayed in 
Table 2. At the 12-month follow-up, 66 (94%) patients were 
available for the clinical follow-up. Three from the acute 
and one from the delayed group was missing regarding 
clinical results. The only significant difference between the 
groups at the time of surgery was the time between injury 
and reconstruction. 


 
 


All patients were assessed regarding sick leave during the 
first year. Seventeen (25%) patients out of 69 were stu- 
dents without registered compensation for sick leave. An 
additional 3 (4%) patients were not students, but were not 
registered for any compensation for sick leave from work; 
these patients were predominantly self-employed and did 
not claim any sick leave compensation. 49 out of 69 (71%) 
patients received compensation for sick leave, 26 in the acute 
group and 23 in the delayed group. No differences were seen 
in regard to occupations involving heavy or light manual 
labor; Table 1. 
Total amount of days’ sick leave by study group are pre- 
sented in Fig. 2. The mean number of sick-leave days for the 
acute group was significantly lower (M = 56.9, SD = 36.4) 
compared to the delayed group (M = 88.5, SD = 50.2), 
p < 0.05. 
Distribution of sick-leave days differed between the 
groups, the acute group had one continuous period, while 
the delayed had either one continuous or two separate peri- 
ods depending on the physical demands of the occupation. 
The delayed group was on sick leave for a mean of 23 days 
before reconstruction. 
On average the acute group also had fewer days for recov- 
ery after surgery, but not statistically different (M = 52.0 
SD = 36.1) compared to the delayed group (M = 65.6, 
SD = 45.5), p = n.s.(0.25) (Fig. 3). 

After the injury, the acute group was less affected in 
the KOOS subscales ‘pain’ and ‘quality of life’. After 
12 months, the KOOS were similar in the groups (Fig. 4), 
with significant changes after injury to 12 months, but no 
significant difference between the groups at any time-point. 
Both groups had improved Tegner and Lysholm scores from 
inclusion to the 12-month follow-up (Table 3). 
The overall objective, IKDC as well as manual laxity 
measurements using pivot shift and Rolimeter did not dem- 
onstrate any statistically significant differences (Table 3). 


No differences were found between the groups in the one- 
leg hop test or thigh muscle atrophy. At 12 months after 
reconstruction there were more patients cleared to return to 
sports in the acute group, however there was no statistical 
difference. 































The findings in this study are supporting the conclusion 
of Herbst et al. that ACLR within 48 h is preferable in highly 
active patients to avoid unnecessary delay for return to full 
activity [9]. Our findings are also consistent with those of 
Maher et al. who found a greater improvement of QALY 
with ACLR compared to structured rehabilitation alone and 
concluded that it is the unstable knee that costs the society 
due to the loss of wages, productivity and disability. 
In contrast to the results in this study, Frobell et al. found 
a lesser QALY improvement after ACLR, and therefore 
found ACLR to be less cost-effective. They concluded that 
early reconstruction was not superior to initial nonsurgical 
treatment with optional delayed reconstruction and stated 
that early reconstruction did not have any economic benefits 
[21, 28]. A consideration regarding this conclusion is the 
number of patients in the study that underwent reconstruc- 
tion in the optional delayed group. At the 5-year follow- 
up 51% had undergone delayed reconstruction and these 
patients required significantly more meniscus procedures 
compared to those who underwent early reconstruction [29]. 
The study by Frobell et al. also excluded sick-leave costs that 
did not extend over 14 days. 
The differences in costs between the two strategies are 
affected by several variables and can be measured in dif- 
ferent ways. As such, using sick days as a proxy for socio- 
economic costs has its limitations and may not completely 
reflect socioeconomic costs. However, this study supports 
our assertion that a change in the timing of ACL surgery, 
when indicated, could reduce the socioeconomic costs to 
society resulting from ACL injury. 
It is not always obvious which patients should undergo 
early reconstruction and which patients will achieve a good 
outcome with conservative treatment. A patient with high 
functional demands and risk for giving way, who is not pre- 
pared to adjust activities and has an unstable knee imme- 
diately post-injury, is generally better treated with acute 
ACLR. A low-demand patient with below average risk of 
symptomatic instability can undergo rehabilitation first and 
undergo delayed ACLR should instability arise. The chal- 
lenge is often determining which treatment is optimal in 
patients who do not neatly fit into these two groups, balanc- 
ing the risks of unnecessary surgery for those who could 
successfully be managed conservatively against the risks 
and costs of treatment delay for those who go on to require 
surgery. 
The major strength of this study is the prospective, rand- 
omized design with four experienced surgeons performing 
all of the ACL reconstructions with the same surgical tech- 
nique. Furthermore, one centre with the same postoperative 
rehabilitation protocol was used in both groups. Another 
strength is that the study population was selected from a 
highly motivated patient category with an activity level that 
justifies reconstruction and a strict definition of the time 
Fig. 4 Mean KOOS scores with significant changes after injury to 
12 months, but no significant difference between the groups at any 
time-point 
The muscle strength peak torque in percent of uninjured 
limb was significant higher for the acute group (Biodex® 
test). 

The major finding of this study was that a reduction in indi- 
rect costs (as defined by lost wages and sick-leave days) 
was seen in the acute ACLR group. These results support 
the notion that early ACL reconstruction could be more 
cost-effective than delayed surgical treatment strategies as 
reported in several studies [19, 20, 26, 27]. 
In both groups, there was a significant improvement in 
self-reported quality of life after the injury to 1 year after 
surgery. There was no difference between the groups with 
respect to the IKDC score [23], with 83% of the partici- 
pants in the acute group scoring either A or B compared to 
80% in the delayed. There were no significant differences in 
measurements of knee laxity and knee ROM, suggesting that 
the benefits of acute surgery are primarily seen in the early 
phase after the surgery and that good results can be achieved 
after 1 year regardless of timing. There was no significant 
muscle atrophy of the thigh muscles compared to the con- 
tralateral leg in either group at the 12 months follow-up. 
There was however a significant difference in knee flexion 
strength, with an advantage for acute surgery, indicating that 
there is a potential for faster muscle recovery with acute 
surgery.

loss to follow-up rate was negligible (n = 1) regarding data 
on sick-leave. 
The results of this study should however be interpreted in 
light of some limitations. Firstly, the pre-study power analy- 
sis was made to detect differences in range of motion and 
not days of sick leave. However, the differences between the 
groups are large which increases the likelihood of the results 
being true even with a post hoc power analysis of 70%. Sec- 
ondly, despite there being several other factors that affect 
the total cost of ACLR, we have only assessed the number 
of sick-leave days as a proxy for socioeconomic costs. We 
also did not have a nonoperative counterpart for comparison 
and our study is only focused on individuals with at least a 
moderate activity level. 
As for clinical relevance, this study demonstrates that 
acute ACLR can be performed safely in highly active 
patients and ensure an earlier return to work and full activity. 

Acute and delayed ACLR provided comparable clinical 
outcomes after 12 months. Acute reconstruction resulted 
in less sick-leave days and as such fewer indirect costs to 
the individual and society. These findings suggest that if 
patients requiring ACLR can be identified early and ACLR 
can be performed in the acute phase, socioeconomic costs 
can potentially be reduced by minimizing time off work.
