Abstract
Purpose
This prospective randomized study compared
acute
and
chronic anterior cruciate
ligament
(ACL)
reconstruction using ligament advanced reinforcement
system (LARS) artiﬁcial ligament in young active adults
with a 5-year follow-up.
Methods
Fifty-ﬁve patients were enrolled in this study
and divided into two groups based on the elapsed time
between the injury and reconstruction: the acute group
(3–7 weeks) and the chronic group (6–11 months). The
clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Lysholm knee
scoring scale, the Tegner activity rating, a KT-1000
Arthrometer, and the International Knee Documentation
Committee (IKDC) scoring system. Isokinetic strength of
the quadriceps and hamstring was assessed using the Bio-
dex System 3 isokinetic dynamometer.
Results
Anterior laxity was decreased and quadriceps/
hamstring muscle strength was increased in the acute group
compared to the chronic group (p [ 0.05). There were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences in Lysholm scores,
Tegner activity scores, and the IKDC evaluation form
between the two groups.
Conclusions
These results suggest that earlier ACL
reconstruction using a LARS artiﬁcial ligament may pro-
vide an advantage in the treatment and rehabilitation of
ACL rupture.

Introduction
The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is the primary
structure that provides knee joint stability. The function of
the ACL is to limit excessive anterior displacement during
movement. Thus, an ACL rupture can lead to instability
and increased abrasion of the knee joint, a higher proba-
bility of meniscus injury, and future arthritis.
An ACL rupture is a common sports injury, especially in
an otherwise healthy population of active young people.
However, the beneﬁts of early or delayed ACL reconstruc-
tion, and the optimal time interval between injury and repair
remain controversial [1–7]. Noyes et al. [4] concluded that
patients with acute injury experience less pain and fewer
limitations than chronic cases, and they emphasized the
need for earlier reconstruction and joint stabilization in
active persons. Cipolla et al. [3] suggested that the ‘‘ideal’’
time for an ACL reconstruction is during the 3–6 weeks
after the initial injury, and that patients should follow a well-
planned program of exercises to strengthen the quadriceps
and hamstrings before surgery. In contrast, Wasilewski et al.
[1] reported that knee recovery after acute ACL recon-
struction (performed within 1 month after injury) is signif-
icantly slower than after chronic reconstruction. Other
studies [2, 6] indicate that there are minimal differences in
outcome when comparing early and delayed ACL recon-
struction. One [2] recommendation is that arthroscopic ACL
reconstruction should be performed within 6 weeks of the
primary knee injury, as delayed treatment may predispose
patients to cartilage lesions and meniscal tears.

Reconstruction of an ACL rupture using the ligament
advanced reinforcement system (LARS) graft has become
an increasingly popular treatment option[8–14]. As a
third-generation artiﬁcial ligament, the LARS graft can
provide sufﬁcient strength to imitate normal ACL function
and adapt to daily activities, competitive sports, or stren-
uous activities, when implanted into the knee joint. Due to
its intrinsic properties, the LARS ligament does not
undergo ‘‘ligamentization’’ [15, 16], which is a charac-
teristic of allografts and autografts. This allows the LARS
graft to endure stretching and twisting forces during post-
operative rehabilitation or mild activities [13], and may
provide an advantage in the early return to unrestricted
sports and strenuous activities. As such, LARS may be the
ideal choice for implantation in young active patients.
Indeed, evidence suggests that patients who choose a
LARS graft reconstruction can begin their rehabilitation
earlier [8, 10]. Several studies have focused on evaluating
the outcome of LARS and other grafts such as the bone-
patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) and hamstring grafts [17–
19]. Data have shown that the therapeutic effects of ACL
reconstruction using a LARS ligament can last several
years [8, 10, 12–14, 17–19], but there has not been a
comparison of the clinical outcome between acute and
chronic
patients
treated
with
a
LARS
ligament
reconstruction.
The aim of this study was to compare the clinical out-
come of ACL reconstruction using a LARS ligament in
patients at the acute and chronic stage following knee
injury. We hypothesized that patients undergoing earlier
ACL reconstruction using a LARS ligament would have
better treatment and rehabilitation outcomes than chronic
patients.
Materials and methods
Subjects
From March 2004 to April 2007, 62 patients who under-
went ACL reconstructions using LARS grafts in our
institution were considered eligible to participate in our
prospective randomized study.
The inclusion criteria for this study were: (1) unilateral
ACL rupture with a normal contralateral knee; (2) pri-
mary reconstruction using a LARS graft; (3) a visible
ACL remnant by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
[14]; and (4) patients younger than 50 years of age. The
exclusion criteria were: (1) a combined ligament injury or
additional existing ligament instability in the affected
knee; (2) contralateral knee ligament injury; (3) previous
history of knee surgery; (4) infection or septic arthritis in
either knee; and (5) patients who declined to participate.
In addition, patients who failed to comply with the
rehabilitation protocol, were lost to follow-up, or con-
cealed a repeat injury during the study period were
excluded.
Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients
who participated in this study. The study was authorized by
our institutional review board of Taizhou Hospital and was
performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the
Declaration of Helsinki (revised in 2000) as it was in effect
during the study period. All patients were advised about the
differences and risks associated with autograft, allograft,
and synthetic ligament procedures; the selection of which
graft to use was made by the patient. Pursuant to the
patients’ decisions, ACL reconstructions with LARS arti-
ﬁcial ligaments were performed.
A total 55 patients were ﬁnally enrolled in our pro-
spective, randomized study: 27 patients were randomly
assigned to the acute group and 28 to the chronic group.
We allocated the patients by rolling a dice: those patients
with odd digits were assigned to the acute group, and those
with even digits to the chronic group. All operations were
performed by a treatment team that consisted of two
experienced arthroscopic orthopedic sports medicine sur-
geons (Jia Chen and Aiqun Gu).
Demographic and clinical data before ACL reconstruc-
tion using the LARS ligament are shown in Table 1. The
acute group underwent surgery 3–7 weeks after the initial
ACL injury, and the chronic group underwent surgery
6–11 months after the initial ACL injury. The mean follow-
up time was 61.2 months. The acute group included
15 male and 12 female patients with a mean age of
29.4 ± 5.8 years old. The chronic group included 11 male
and 17 female patients with a mean age of 31.9 ± 7.0 years
old.

techniques.
A
diagnostic
arthroscopy
was
performed
through standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals
under adequate anesthesia. The identiﬁcation of the actual
condition of the ACL rupture and intra-articular structure
was performed at this time. Any medial or lateral meniscus
injuries were treated by partial meniscectomy or meniscus
repair at the same time. During arthroscopic diagnosis, the
scar tissue that had adhered to the deﬁcient ACL and sur-
rounding tissue was slightly loosened. The ACL remnant
was preserved as much as possible, especially on the tibial
side. The LARS (Arc-sur-Tille, France) artiﬁcial ligament
was used for ACL reconstruction in our study.
The surgical procedure and isometric insertion tech-
niques were performed as described by Dericks [13].
Drilling resulted in tibial and femoral tunnels that were
7.5 mm in diameter in all patients. The tibial drill guide
was used to locate the intra-articular point of the tibial
tunnel in the middle of the tibial ACL footprint. The
femoral tunnel was positioned at 10:30 o’clock on the
right knee, and at nearly 1:30 o’clock on the left knee.
Guided by a cannulated tube, a loop wire was inserted
through the tibial tunnel to the center of the ACL stump,
and pierced through into the femoral tunnel until it ﬁnally
reached the lateral thigh. The LARS ligament was intro-
duced by the loop wire, inserted into the intra-articular
joint through the ACL stump, and the longitudinal free
ﬁbers were retained in the joint. The end of the LARS
ligament was ﬁxed in the femoral tunnel with an inter-
ference screw. Reliable tension on the LARS ligament
was achieved by pulling the tibial end of the LARS and
maximally extending and ﬂexing the knee 20 times. The
LARS graft in the tibial tunnel was ﬁxed with an inter-
ference screw with a knee ﬂexion of 30. The residual
ends of the tibial and femoral LARS ligament were cut
off using a customized sharp reamer.

Rehabilitation protocol
A physical therapist (Haitao Jiang) at our institution who
was blinded to subject assignment carried out physiother-
apeutics and rehabilitation in the two groups. The acute
group required four types of treatment interventions during
pre-operative rehabilitation, including counseling, symp-
tom relief, physiotherapy, and gradual exercise (Table 2).
The chronic group was provided with a comprehensive pre-
operative physiotherapy program that did not include
interventions for symptom relief.
All of the patients received the same post-operative
rehabilitation protocol (Table 3). One day after surgery,
several interventions focused on reducing discomfort and
complications, such as pain, swelling, and inﬂammation.
Patients also began some initial exercises on the affected
extremity. A continuous passive motion (CPM) instrument
was set to 0–30 ROM. After 3 days to 1 week, isometric
and isotonic quadriceps exercises were performed to
increase thigh muscle strength. At approximately 1 week,
patients were allowed to undertake partial weight-bearing
activities assisted by crutches. The CPM was set to 0–40
ROM. In the ﬁrst month, patients were asked to achieve
full weight-bearing activities without crutches, and to
begin balance and gait training assisted by a walker. The
CPM passive activity was set to 0–130 ROM. At
2–3 months, patients gradually achieved locomotor activ-
ity without any auxiliary tools. After 1 year or more,
patients could perform some recreational or non-compet-
itive sports.
Clinical outcome evaluation and statistical analyses
Patients in the two groups were followed for an average of
61.2 months
(5.1 years).
The
KT-1000
Arthrometer
(Medmetric, San Diego, CA, USA) was used clinically to
evaluate knee stability. The Lysholm score, the Tegner
activity score, and the International Knee Documentation
Committee (IKDC) scoring systems were used to clinically
evaluate
knee
function
outcomes.
Muscle
strength,
including the quadriceps and hamstring, was evaluated
relative to the strength of the contralateral limb and is
presented as a percentage of the operative knee to the
contralateral limb (100 %). Muscle strength was assessed
using the Biodex System 3 isokinetic dynamometer (Bio-
dex Medical Inc., New York, USA) at an angular velocity
of 60 and 180/s at 1 year following surgery and at the ﬁnal
follow-up visit. Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS 19.0 software. Data are expressed as mean ± SD.
The Levene’s test was used to evaluate whether there was
equal variance in the continuous variables. Data that were
normally distributed as well as paired data were analyzed
using a Student’s t test. Categorical variables were com-
pared using the Chi squared test. The threshold for statis-
tical signiﬁcance was p \ 0.05.
Results
Before ACL reconstruction, there were no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences between the groups in terms of the number of
patients, gender distribution, age, Lysholm score, Tegner
activity score or pre-operative trauma symptoms. Pre-
operative recurrent episodes of instability occurred in
33.3 % (9/27) patients in the acute group, while 25 % (7/
28) patients in chronic group. And 29.6 % (8/27) and 32 %
(9/28) patients suffered from persistent pain pre-opera-
tively in the acute and chronic groups, respectively.
The assessment of knee function is shown in Table 4.
After 1 year, the mean Lysholm scores between the acute
(93.37 ± 3.89) and chronic groups (91.64 ± 5.12) were
not signiﬁcantly different (p = 0.164). At the ﬁnal follow-
up 5 years after
surgery,
the
Lysholm
scores
were
95.04 ± 5.10 and 92.64 ± 5.48 for the acute and chronic
groups, respectively (p = 0.099). The mean Tegner activ-
ity score showed similar trends. One year after recon-
struction, there was no signiﬁcant difference between the
acute
(6.3 ± 1.1)
and
chronic
(6.1 ± 0.9)
groups
(p = 0.413). The acute and chronic groups were similar
5 years after the reconstruction, scoring 6.3 ± 1.3 and
6.3 ± 1.2, respectively (p = 0.978). In terms of the overall
IKDC rating scale, a ‘‘normal’’ grade was attained by 23/27
(85 %) of the patients in the acute group 1 year after sur-
gery and 20/27 (74 %) patients after 5 years. In the chronic
group, 18/28 (64 %) patients attained ‘‘normal’’ function
after 1 year and 17/28 (61 %) after 5 years.
Anterior laxity in the knee was assessed using the KT-
1000 Arthrometer (30 ﬂexion and 134 N) (Table 5). At
the 5-year follow-up, the mean side-to-side difference was
2.35 ± 1.21 and 2.88 ± 1.26 mm in the acute and chronic
groups, respectively (p = 0.116). Even though the results
were not signiﬁcantly different, the actual side-to-side
difference was slightly higher in the chronic group com-
pared with the acute group at the ﬁnal follow-up visit.
The Biodex System 3 isokinetic dynamometer was used
to record quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength at a
velocity of 60 and at 180/s. The maximal peak torque was
evaluated as percentage of the operative knee to the con-
tralateral limb (100 %). The quadriceps strength in the
acute group at both the 1 and 5-year follow-ups was greater
than in the chronic group (Fig. 1). Similar results were
obtained with regard to hamstring strength (Fig. 2). How-
ever, there was not a statistically signiﬁcant difference
between the two groups after the LARS reconstruction.

None of the patients had severe symptoms such as
synthetic ligament rupture and obvious synovitis of the
knee at the ﬁnal follow-up. There were also no superﬁcial
or deep infections in any of the patients, and wound healing
post-operatively
occurred
without
complications.
One
patient in each group was affected by mild arthroﬁbrosis
post-operatively. Only 1 patient in the acute group suffered
persistent arthralgia 8 months after the operation due to
loosening of the femoral screw (Fig. 3).
Discussion
This midterm follow-up of ACL reconstruction using the
LARS ligament showed that patients who underwent ear-
lier ACL reconstruction had improved clinical outcomes,
experienced less pain and instability of the injured knee,
and achieved earlier rehabilitation compared to patients
who delayed surgery. In accordance with our ﬁndings,
Goradia et al. [5] reported that patients who underwent

ACL reconstruction with a triple-strand hamstring tendon
graft within 6 weeks of injury achieved higher scores on
the Lysholm scale and Cincinnati function scale, and more
patients achieved normal grades on the IKDC standard
form, when compared to patients who underwent recon-
struction at 32.3 months after initial injury. In the current
study, post-operative Lysholm scores, Tegner activity
scores, and scores on the IKDC evaluation form were
slightly better in the acute group, although there were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences between the acute and
chronic groups. However, in the chronic group, 25 % of
patients experienced recurrent episodes of instability pre-
operatively, and 32 % of patients suffered from persistent
pre-operative pain. These symptoms were present for
6 months until the patients received their initial surgery.
Acute intervention would provide early relief from this
discomfort.
Compared with autograft reconstructive surgeries, a
LARS graft is able to endure stretching and twisting forces
immediately after surgery. However, ligament laxity is an
inevitable challenge associated with ligament reconstruc-
tion surgery. There is a close relationship between ligament
laxity and the ligament stump. Several studies have noted
that the LARS graft can be implanted while preserving the
remnant of the ACL tissue, especially on the tibial side [13,
14, 20]. The new generation of LARS ligament consists of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The porosity of this
material allows ﬁbroblasts and osteoblast-like cells to grow
into the intra-articular multiﬁlament portion [8, 9, 12, 21].
In the present study, the mean anterior laxity was lower in
the acute group than in the chronic group. This is consistent
with previous work [8] whereby Nau et al. concluded that
the mean measured laxity was greater in their chronic
LARS group, particularly at 6 months post-operation. It is
possible that the ACL remnant forms scar tissue around
itself by 6 months after the injury, which prevents new
neurovascular tissue from adhering to the ﬁber of the
synthetic ligament. If this is the case, the viable stump
would not augment the physical strength of the LARS graft
during stretching and twisting [22]. In vivo and in vitro
evidence suggests that performing ACL reconstruction
earlier after initial rupture can be beneﬁcial for the growth
of the preserved ACL remnant [21], and can help avoid a
variable pattern of scar formation and associated changes
in knee laxity [23]. Furthermore, delayed reconstruction
can result in impingement of the ACL remnant [20] and
abrasion of the cartilaginous surface.
To date, the optimum timing of reconstruction relative
to injury remains controversial. Our study deﬁned an acute
timeframe as less than or approximately 6 weeks post
injury (patients were operated on 3–7 weeks post injury)
and a chronic timeframe as[6 months post injury, which is
consistent with previous reports [1, 4, 6, 10, 24, 25]. Noyes
et al. [4] deﬁned the mean acute pre-operative interval as
6 weeks and the chronic pre-operative interval as ACL
rupture at least 3 months before ACL reconstruction using
a patellar tendon autograft. They showed early ACL
reconstruction restored stability in more knees and resulted
in less pain than chronic ACL reconstruction. However,
some studies [1, 7] have suggested that early ACL recon-
struction can increase the risk of stiffness, swelling, and
other mechanical complications such as a reduced range of
motion. In the present study, we deﬁned the ‘‘acute’’ phase
not as an immediate operation after ACL rupture, but as the
time required to systematically manage rehabilitation and
establish a good mental attitude [1, 26].
Implementing a rehabilitation protocol as early as pos-
sible has equally obvious beneﬁts for restoring the strength
of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles, which play an
important role in knee function. The strength of the
quadriceps and hamstring muscles determines the level of
knee ﬂexion or extension after a reconstruction for ACL
deﬁciency [27]. Schenck et al. [28] found that atrophy in
the quadriceps gradually increased after ACL reconstruc-
tion. This suggests a need to regain control of the leg and to
begin performing exercises to prevent quadriceps/ham-
string co-contractions soon after surgery. Patients who
undergo reconstruction using hamstring, BPTB, or any
other grafts such as an allograft require gradual rehabili-
tative exercise, which prolongs the time interval between
initial injury and reconstruction in comparison to patients
treated using a LARS graft. In the present study, patients in
the acute group had slightly greater peak quadriceps and
hamstring torque than in the chronic group, although there
were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between the
two groups 1 and 5 years after surgery. While performing
an ‘‘earlier’’ ACL reconstruction and a pre-operative knee
rehabilitation protocol may contribute to earlier post-

operative rehabilitation of the injured limb and improved
patients’ subjective satisfaction.
Importantly, we did not observe any immediate post-
operative complications. One patient from each group
suffered from mild post-operative arthroﬁbrosis, which was
resolved through gradual rehabilitation, without arthro-
scopic lysis, to achieve a satisfactory clinical outcome. One
patient in the acute group suffered persistent arthralgia
8 months post-operation. This was attributed to femoral
screw loosening. The screw tail was rubbing against the
hypodermis, causing local swelling and pain, but did not
result in anterior knee laxity. The screw was adjusted, and
the screw tail drilled into the femoral tunnel. The patient’s
symptoms resolved within 2 weeks, consistent with ﬁnd-
ings from Gao et al. [14].
Our study has several strengths. First, we evaluated
clinical outcomes in patients who underwent early and
delayed LARS artiﬁcial ligament reconstruction for ACL
rupture. Second, we implemented a rigid, detailed, and
systematic rehabilitation protocol for all patients, which
aimed to minimize the complications associated with knee
recovery after injury. Finally, we retained the ligament
stump in all enrolled patients to facilitate the reconstruction
of ligamentous and neurovascular tissues. However, our
study is also subject to several limitations. First, we did not
investigate the clinical outcome of meniscal injury. Sec-
ond, the subacute phase deﬁned in some literature was not
included. Addressing the role of the subacute phase is a
goal for our next research study. Third, the number of cases
in our observational cohort was small, and the result could
be different in a large sample size. Finally, while the mean
follow-up time was 5 years, additional studies are required
for longer-term follow-up of patients undergoing ACL
reconstructions with LARS graft.
Conclusion
This study suggests that performing ACL reconstruction
soon after injury using a LARS graft could provide an
advantage for treating and rehabilitating ACL ruptures, as
long as the acute reconstruction is based on the foundation
of a good rehabilitation protocol that improves the recovery
of the patient’s injured limb.
