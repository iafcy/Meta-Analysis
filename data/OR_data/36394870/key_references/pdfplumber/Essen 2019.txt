Abstract
Purpose To compare the total number of sick-leave days caused by the knee injury from the day of injury and over the first
year between acute (within 8 days) and delayed (6–10 weeks) anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and also
assess other clinical outcomes during this period.
Methods Seventy patients with an acute ACL injury and Tegner level of 6 or more were randomized to acute (within 8 days)
or delayed (after 6–10 weeks) ACLR. Patient-reported outcomes; objective IKDC and manual stability measurements were
assessed at 6 and 12 months. With data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan) information about
the number of sick-leave days due to the knee injury over the following 12 months was collected and compared between the
two groups.
Results Seventy-one percent received compensation for sick leave (26 in the acute versus 23 in the delayed group). The
mean number of sick-leave days for the acute group was significantly lower (M = 56.9, SD = 36.4) compared to the delayed
group (M = 88.5, SD = 50.2), p < 0.05. The acute group was also significantly stronger in flexion in both slow and fast angle
velocities according to Biodex®. No other differences were found between the groups in other clinical assessments or in
terms of associated injuries.
Conclusion Acute and delayed ACLR provided comparable clinical outcomes after 12 months. Acute reconstruction resulted
in less sick-leave days and as such fewer indirect costs to the individual and society. These findings suggest that if patients
requiring ACLR can be identified early and ACLR can be performed in the acute phase, socioeconomic costs can potentially
be reduced by minimizing time off work.

Sick‑leave days
All patients were assessed regarding sick leave during the
first year. Seventeen (25%) patients out of 69 were stu-
dents without registered compensation for sick leave. An
additional 3 (4%) patients were not students, but were not
registered for any compensation for sick leave from work;
these patients were predominantly self-employed and did
not claim any sick leave compensation. 49 out of 69 (71%)
patients received compensation for sick leave, 26 in the acute
group and 23 in the delayed group. No differences were seen
in regard to occupations involving heavy or light manual
labor; Table 1.
Total amount of days’ sick leave by study group are pre-
sented in Fig. 2. The mean number of sick-leave days for the
acute group was significantly lower (M = 56.9, SD = 36.4)
compared to the delayed group (M = 88.5, SD = 50.2),
p < 0.05.
Distribution of sick-leave days differed between the
groups, the acute group had one continuous period, while
the delayed had either one continuous or two separate peri-
ods depending on the physical demands of the occupation.
The delayed group was on sick leave for a mean of 23 days
before reconstruction.
160
On average the acute group also had fewer days for recov-
ery after surgery, but not statistically different (M = 52.0
140 SD = 36.1) compared to the delayed group (M = 65.6,
SD = 45.5), p = n.s.(0.25) (Fig. 3).
