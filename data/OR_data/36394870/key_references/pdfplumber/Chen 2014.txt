evidence suggests that performing ACL reconstruction
earlier after initial rupture can be beneficial for the growth
of the preserved ACL remnant [21], and can help avoid a
variable pattern of scar formation and associated changes
in knee laxity [23]. Furthermore, delayed reconstruction
can result in impingement of the ACL remnant [20] and
abrasion of the cartilaginous surface.
