India measurement of the range of movement. Stability was assessed by clinical tests and
measurements taken with the KT-1000 arthrometer, with all testing performed by a blinded
uninvolved experienced observer. A total of six patients were lost to follow-up, with
48patients assigned to the delayed group and 51 to the early group. None was a
competitive athlete. The mean interval between injury and the surgery was seven days
(2to14) in the early group and 32 days (29 to 42) in the delayed group. The mean follow-up
was 32 months (26 to 36).
The results did not show a statistically significant difference for the Lysholm score
(p=0.86), Tegner activity score (p = 0.913) or the range of movement (p = 1). Similarly, no
distinction could be made for stability testing by clinical examination (p = 0.56) and
