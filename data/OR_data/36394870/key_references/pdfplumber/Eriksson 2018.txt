Abstract
Purpose To compare acute ACL reconstruction (ACLR) within 8 days of injury with delayed reconstruction after normalized
range of motion (ROM), 6–10 weeks after injury. It was hypothesized that acute ACL reconstruction with modern techniques
is safe and can be beneficial in terms of patient-reported outcomes and range of motion.
Methods Sample size calculation indicated 64 patients would be required to find a 5° difference in ROM at 3 months. Seventy
patients with high recreational activity level, Tegner level 6 or more, were randomized to acute (within 8 days) or delayed
(6–10 weeks) ACLR between 2006 and 2013. During the first 3 months following surgery patients were contacted weekly by
SMS and asked ‘How is your knee functioning?’, with answers given on a Visual-Analog Scale (0–10). ROM was assessed
after 3 months by the rehab physiotherapist. Patient-reported outcomes, objective IKDC and manual stability measurements
were collected by an independent physiotherapist not involved in the rehab at the 6-month follow-up.
Results At 3-month follow-up, 91% of the patients were assessed with no significant differences in flexion, extension or
total ROM demonstrated between groups. At the 6-month follow-up, the acute group had significantly less muscle atrophy
of the thigh muscle compared to the contralateral leg. Furthermore, a significantly higher proportion of patients in the acute
group passed or were close to passing the one leg hop test (47 versus 21%, p = 0.009). No difference was found between the
groups in the other clinical assessments. Additionally, no significant difference between the groups was found in terms of
associated injuries.
Conclusion Acute ACLR within 8 days of injury does not appear to adversely affect ROM or result in increased stiffness in
the knee joint when compared to delayed surgery.
