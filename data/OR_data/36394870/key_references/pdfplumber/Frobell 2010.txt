RESULTS
Of 62 subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 1 did not
undergo surgery. Of 59 assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL recon-
struction, 23 underwent delayed ACL reconstruction; the other 36 underwent reha-
bilitation alone. The absolute change in the mean KOOS score from baseline to
4
2 years was 39.2 points for those assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL recon-
struction and 39.4 for those assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed recon-
struction (absolute between-group difference, 0.2 points; 95% confidence interval,
−6.5 to 6.8; P = 0.96 after adjustment for the baseline score). There were no signifi-
cant differences between the two treatment groups with respect to secondary out-
comes. Adverse events were common in both groups. The results were similar when
the data were analyzed according to the treatment actually received.
CONCLUSIONS
In young, active adults with acute ACL tears, a strategy of rehabilitation plus early
ACL reconstruction was not superior to a strategy of rehabilitation plus optional
delayed ACL reconstruction. The latter strategy substantially reduced the frequency
of surgical reconstructions. (Funded by the Swedish Research Council and the
Medical Faculty of Lund University and others; Current Controlled Trials number,

† Details are provided in Table C in the Supplementary Appendix.
‡ The Lachman test was used to assess anteroposterior laxity of the knee at rest in a semiflexed position. Scores range
from 0 to 3, with 0 indicating normal laxity and 3 indicating severely increased laxity. Knees with increased laxity
(scores 1 to 3) are represented.
§ In one knee, anteroposterior laxity could not be assessed owing to pain. MRI and arthroscopy confirmed a total ACL
rupture.
¶ In one knee, anteroposterior laxity was found to be normal at baseline, but MRI and arthroscopy confirmed a total
ACL rupture.
‖ In one knee, MRI could confirm only a partial rupture. A positive pivot shift test conducted by two independent clini-
cians confirmed total ACL rupture.
** Meniscal injury was classified as increased signal extending to at least one articular surface of the meniscal body.18
Knees could have more than one meniscal injury reported within the meniscal body. Details are provided in Table C
in the Supplementary Appendix.
†† For all five subscales, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) ranges from 0 to 100, with higher
scores indicating better results. Results at 2 years are shown for KOOS4, which includes four subscales: pain, symp-
toms, function during sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life.19,20
‡‡ Scores on the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) range from 0 to 100, with higher
scores indicating better results.21
§§ The Tegner Activity Scale assesses activity level with specific emphasis on the knee. Scores range from 1 (least stren-
uous activity) to 10 (high knee-demanding activity on a professional level).12

Figure 2. Mean KOOS4 Scores during the 2-Year Study Period, According to Treatment Group.
Panel A shows results of the full analysis for 61 subjects in the group assigned to rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction and for 59 sub-
jects in the group assigned to rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACL reconstruction. Data were not available at two interim visits for 1
subject in the early-reconstruction group, so these results are not included. Panel B shows the results of the post hoc as-treated sub-
group analysis for 60 subjects who underwent rehabilitation plus early ACL reconstruction, 23 subjects who underwent rehabilitation
plus delayed ACL reconstruction, and 36 subjects who underwent rehabilitation alone. Two subjects assigned to rehabilitation plus early
ACL reconstruction completed fewer than 10 rehabilitation visits, so their results are not included. Delayed ACL reconstruction was per-
formed between 5.5 and 19 months after randomization, so that some follow-up visits took place shortly before or after ACL surgery.
The I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. KOOS denotes Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for four subscales (pain,

symptoms, function in sports and recreation, and knee-related quality of life).

activity) to 10 (high knee-demanding activity on a professional level).12
** Subjects were those with a score at 2 years that was the same as or higher than the preinjury score.
†† The KT1000 Arthrometer (MEDmetric) assesses the extent of anteroposterior laxity of the knee in millimeters. The
mean values are the results of three tests performed at 134 newtons.
‡‡ Data were missing for three subjects.
§§ The Lachman test assesses anteroposterior laxity of the knee at rest in a semiflexed position. Results range from 0
(normal laxity) to 3 (severely increased laxity). Data include knees with normal laxity.
¶¶ Data were missing for two subjects.
‖‖ The pivot shift test assesses rotational stability of the knee at rest. Results range from 0 (normal stability) to 3 (severely
increased instability). Data include knees with normal stability.
*** Results of the total area-under-the-curve analysis are shown, with higher scores indicating better results.
††† These subjects had a self-reported KOOS quality-of-life score below 44 at any visit between 6 months and 2 years of
follow-up (predefined treatment-failure criterion).
