Patient-reported outcomes; objective IKDC and manual stability measurements were assessed at 6 and 12 months. With data from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan) information about the number of sick-leave days due to the knee injury over the following 12 months was collected and compared between the two groups.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Seventy-one percent received compensation for sick leave (26 in the acute versus 23 in the delayed group). The mean number of sick-leave days for the acute group was significantly lower (M = 56.9, SD = 36.4) compared to the delayed group (M = 88.5, SD = 50.2), p < 0.05. The acute group was also significantly stronger in flexion in both slow and fast angle velocities according to Biodex®.

Acute reconstruction resulted in less sick-leave days and as such fewer indirect costs to the individual and society. These findings suggest that if patients requiring ACLR can be identified early and ACLR can be performed in the acute phase, socioeconomic costs can potentially be reduced by minimizing time off work.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      II."

            "abstract": "We treated 21 patients with 22 dislocations of the knee by repair or reconstruction of all injured ligaments. Eight knees were treated in the acute phase (less than two weeks after injury); the remainder were treated more than six months after injury (6 to 72). Reconstructions were carried out with a combination of autograft and allograft tendons and by direct ligament repair where possible. At a mean follow-up of 32 months (11 to 77) the mean Lysholm score was 87 (81 to 91) in the acute group and 75 (53 to 100) in the delayed group. The mean Tegner activity rating was 5 in the acute group and 4.4 in the delayed group. The International Knee Documentation Committee assessment revealed no differences between the two groups. Instrumented testing of knee stability indicated better results for anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions which had been undertaken in the acute phase, but no difference in the outcome of posterior cruciate ligament reconstructions. There was no difference in the loss of knee movement between the two groups. Although the differences were small, the outcome in terms of overall knee function, activity levels and anterior tibial translation were better in those knees which had been reconstructed within two weeks of injury."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Heat necrosis due to motorized drilling during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction could be a factor in delayed healing at the bone-tendon graft interface.\n    \n\n\n          Hypothesis:\n        \n      \n      The process of osteointegration could be enhanced using manual drilling. It reduces the invasiveness of mechanical-thermal stress normally caused by the traditional motorized drill bit.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Controlled laboratory study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      ACL reconstruction using semitendinosus tendon autografts was performed in 28 skeletally mature female New Zealand white rabbits, which were randomly divided into 3 groups. In group A (n = 12), the tunnels were drilled using a motorized device; in group B (n = 12), the tunnels were drilled using a manual drill bit; and group C (n = 4) served as a control with sham surgical procedures. The healing process in the tunnels was assessed histologically at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks and graded according to the Tendon-Bone Tunnel Healing (TBTH) scoring system. In addition, another 25 rabbits were used for biomechanical testing. The structural properties of the femur-ACL graft-tibia complex, from animals sacrificed at 8 weeks postoperatively, were determined using uniaxial tests. Stiffness (N/mm) and ultimate load to failure (N) were determined from the resulting load-elongation curves.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The time course investigation showed that manual drilling (group B) had a higher TBTH score and improved mechanical behavior, reflecting better organized collagen fiber continuity at the bone-fibrous tissue interface, better integration between the graft and bone, and early mineralized chondrocyte-like tissue formation at all the time points analyzed with a maximum difference at 4 weeks (TBTH score: 5.4 [group A] vs 12.3 [group B]; P < .001). Stiffness (23.1 ± 8.2 vs 17.8 ± 6.3 N/mm, respectively) and ultimate load to failure (91.8 ± 60.4 vs 55.0 ± 18.0 N, respectively) were significantly enhanced in the specimens treated with manual drilling compared with motorized drilling (P < .05 for both).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The use of manual drilling during ACL reconstruction resulted in better tendon-to-bone healing during the crucial early weeks. Manual drilling was able to improve the biological and mechanical properties of bone-hamstring tendon graft healing and was able to restore postoperative graft function more quickly. Tunnel drilling results in bone loss and deficient tendon-bone healing, and heat necrosis after tunnel enlargement may cause mechanical stress, contributing to a delay in healing. Manual drilling preserved the bone stock inside the tunnel, reduced heat necrosis, and offered a better microenvironment for faster healing at the interface.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      Based on study results, manual drilling could be used successfully in human ACL reconstruction, but further clinical studies are needed. A clinical alternative, called the original \"all-inside\" technique, has been developed for ACL reconstruction. In this technique, the femoral and tibial tunnels are manually drilled only halfway through the bone for graft fixation, reducing bone loss. Data from this study suggest that hamstring tendon-to-bone healing can be improved using a manual drilling technique to form femoral and tibial tunnels."

The combined operation was performed on patients with symptomatic chronic ACL rupture who also had varus malalignment on unilateral weight bearing, usually secondary to a previous medial meniscectomy. All patients originally played regular sports, but before the combined operation, 31 did not play at all. The operation had a low morbidity, and significantly improved clinical symptoms, clinical stability, and functional stability. Postoperatively only one patient could play competitive sports, although a further 26 could play leisure sports. At review there was no radiological progression of osteoarthrosis, and 37 patients (91%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the operation. Performing a valgus tibial osteotomy improved the results of ACL reconstruction in patients with acquired varus malalignment and extended the indications of ACL reconstruction to include patients younger than 40 years of age with early medial compartment osteoarthrosis."

The most appropriate rehabilitation program after meniscus repair is unclear. Many meniscus repairs occur in association with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions. An accelerated program permitting early full weight bearing, unrestricted motion, and no limitations on pivoting sports after the resolution of the postoperative effusion and full motion is established encourages patients and surgeon acceptance of the meniscus repair. To evaluate the success of meniscus repair in this accelerated rehabilitation program, a consecutive series of 63 patients with 65 meniscus tears undergoing arthroscopic meniscus repair were followed for a minimum of 2 years. There were seven failures (11%) at an average follow up of 38 months. The average patient age was 26 (range, 13 to 44). Arthroscopic relooks were done in 26%. Successful meniscal healing occurred in 92% of repairs done with ACL reconstructions, but only 67% of meniscus repairs performed in ACL-deficient knees, and 67% of meniscus repairs done in stable knees with no ACL injury. There was no statistical difference in the failures for acute and chronic meniscus tears, nor in the age of the patient undergoing the meniscal repair. Published rehabilitation protocols differ considerably on the three main issues of immobilization, weight bearing, and return to pivoting sports. These data show a meniscus repair success rate consistent with other published series. No modification of an ACL reconstruction accelerated rehabilitation program is needed for meniscus repairs performed in conjunction with the reconstruction."

An early rehabilitation protocol was instituted. At 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, allograft and autograft groups were compared based on side-to-side arthrometer difference, swelling, pain, range of motion, patellofermoral pain and crepitation, Lachman's test, pivot shift test, and side-to-side thigh circumference difference. Average age in the autograft group was 25 years (range, 15 to 43; standard deviation, 8.1), and in the allograft group was 27 years (range, 15 to 55; standard deviation, 10.9).

Indwelling femoral catheters utilized for 2 days postoperatively provided superior analgesia to a single-injection femoral nerve block. Local anesthetic injections at the surgical wound site or intra-articularly provided equivalent analgesia to regional nerve blocks. Continuous-infusion catheters of a local anesthetic provided adequate pain relief but have been shown to cause chondrolysis. Cryotherapy improved analgesia compared to no cryotherapy in 4 trials, while in 4 trials, ice water and water at room temperature provided equivalent analgesic effects.

Arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction was typically performed using the central one-third of the patellar ligament, as a graft, with bone blocks. Fixing was performed using screws (spongy or interferential, Mitek type). In the cases who required revision of the surgery, we used a graft m. semitendinosus and m. gracilise (STG) or a graft of the patellar ligament (B-Pt-B).

Early and late postoperative complications were noticeable in 3.5% each. Hypotrophy of the upper knee musculature up to 2 cm was present in 53.9% of the operated knees, while minor contractions in 13.6% of them.

In this retrospective study, young adults engaged in nonprofessional sportive activities undergoing ACL reconstruction by the Kenneth-Jones technique were assessed clinically and with gait analysis, to detect any deficits persisting even after rehabilitation at a follow- up of approximately 6 months. Eight patients who had undergone elective ligament reconstruction by Kenneth-Jones were assessed between the 5th and 7th month postsurgery with clinical-anamnestic investigation, including the Hughston Clinic subjective knee questionnaire and by gait analysis with the EL.I.Te. system. Gait analysis showed a reduction of ACL protection mechanisms during initial stance; furthermore, the operated limb globally exhibited greater difficulty in muscle recruitment. Residual deficits in muscle recruitment, exposing the reconstructed ligament to possible injuries, persist after a rehabilitation program and after resuming ofpre-surgery activities, thus adjustment of the rehabilitative program on the basis of these findings is recommended."

            "abstract": "Despite many recent advances in the understanding of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and its function, the optimal treatment of PCL injuries remains controversial. Although it now is well known that the PCL is made up of two distinct bundles, each of which plays a vital role in achieving knee stability, questions abound regarding the need for double-bundle reconstruction rather than single-bundle techniques. Currently, the reconstruction technique is selected based on the injury pattern. In acute (< 3 weeks from the time of injury) combined PCL injuries (PCL/posterolateral corner, PCL/medial collateral ligament, and knee dislocations), a single-bundle reconstruction designed to replicate the anatomy of the anterolateral bundle is used. In acute or chronic PCL injuries in which both the posteromedial bundle of the PCL and the meniscofemoral ligaments remain intact, a single-bundle augmentation is used. A double-bundle reconstruction is performed when all three components of the PCL complex (anterolateral band, posteromedial band, and meniscofemoral ligaments) have been ruptured. These patterns are generally chronic, with severe knee laxity following a previous traumatic injury (PCL/posterolateral corner or knee dislocation). Tailoring the PCL reconstruction technique to the individual injury pattern will likely yield a reconstruction that better replicates the natural biomechanics of the native knee, thereby resulting in better functional outcomes."

The mean age at the time of surgery was 25.7 years (range, 13-56 years). Indications for the combined ACL/ALL procedure were associated Segond fractures, grade 3 pivot shift, or high levels of sporting activity. Patients with chronic ruptures or with multiligament injuries were excluded. The Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), and Marx activity scale were collected preoperatively and at 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Patients with any postoperative complications were identified at the time of this analysis.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The mean follow-up period was 44.8 months. Five patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 38 patients (88.4%) in the final analysis. The mean KOOS for Pain, Symptoms, Activities of Daily Living, Sport/Recreation, and Quality of Life improved from a respective 64.9, 58.6, 75.0, 33.7, and 28.9 preoperatively to 91.1, 81.8, 96.1, 82.8, and 74.3 at the 2-year follow-up (P < .0001). The mean WOMAC scores for pain, stiffness, and function improved from 77.5, 65.3, and 75.0 preoperatively to 94.6, 88.6, and 96.0 at the 2-year follow-up (P < .0001). The VAS pain score improved from 3.4 preoperatively to 0.7 at the 2-year follow-up, and the VR-12 physical score improved from 34.4 preoperatively to 52.7 at the 2-year follow-up (P < .0001 for both ).

For the induction of chondromalacia, we used the Pond-Nuki technique, which involved severance and resection of the anterior cruciate ligament, as a canine model of arthropathy in 27 foxhounds (three groups of nine animals each). In a pilot study, we evaluated the effect of resection of the anterior cruciate ligament with no therapy. Patellar specimens were retrieved at 3, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Subsequently, we compared a treatment group that received intraarticular injections of hyaluronan with a placebo group that received saline solution. The groups were compared at 3, 6, and 12 weeks postoperatively. Three animals from the treatment and placebo groups received five injections of hyaluronan during one of the 4-week intervals (weeks 3-6, 6-9, or 12-15). Specimens were retrieved 5 weeks after the last injection. In both groups, the uninvolved contralateral knee served as a control. The specimens were taken from the medial and lateral patellar poles. Histological analysis included light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The structural and ultrastructural changes were assessed qualitatively and were quantified with use of a modified Mankin score. Our results indicate that chondromalacia patellae may be induced with the Pond-Nuki technique. We found a significant reduction (p < 0.01) of cartilaginous lesions in the hyaluronan group compared with the placebo group. Our results suggest that intraarticularly applied hyaluronan is effective in delaying the degenerative process of cartilage degradation. Therefore, we conclude that the use of hyaluronan may be indicated during the early stages of chondromalacia."

            "abstract": "This review focuses on the management of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction patients when other concomitant pathology may need to be addressed at the time of surgery. Given the role of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus in preventing osteoarthritis progression and contributing to knee stability, medial meniscus repair should always be considered when performing ACL reconstruction. Meniscal transplant may also be appropriate in select patients with normal knee alignment and absent of cartilage abnormalities in the compartment. Varus alignment with a varus thrust or increased posterior tibial slope will increase stress on the ACL graft and may predispose to early failure. Alignment should be assessed with appropriate radiographs and corrective osteotomy in isolation or in conjunction with ACL reconstruction should be considered for certain patients. Low-grade medial collateral ligament (MCL) and lateral collateral ligament (LCL) injuries can be treated nonsurgically prior to ACL reconstruction. These are frequently missed with either physical examination or radiographic imaging. High-grade LCL injuries are often treated with repair versus reconstruction in conjunction with ACL reconstruction depending on the timing of the injury. When chronic MCL injuries show opening in extension, MCL reconstruction may be needed in addition to the ACL reconstruction to improve outcome. The role of extra-articular reconstruction or anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction remains controversial but may have a role in protecting rotatory stability in primary ACL reconstruction for high-risk patients, and in the revision setting. Cartilage lesions noted in the setting of ACL injury should be considered. Small, asymptomatic lesions in locations unrelated to the ACL injury may not necessitate additional intervention. Large symptomatic lesions may require additional cartilage restoration procedures at the time of ACL reconstruction or in a staged fashion. In this ICL, we will address the diagnosis, management, and surgical indications of other concomitant pathology associated with ACL ruptures."

Recent studies suggest that changes in brain activity (i.e., functional neuroplasticity) may be related to ACL injury. The purpose of this article is to summarize the available evidence of functional brain plasticity after an ACL injury. A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of the Joanna Briggs Institute and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The terms \"brain,\" \"activity,\" \"neuroplasticity,\" \"ACL,\" \"injury,\" and \"reconstruction\" were used in an electronic search of articles in PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus databases. Eligible studies included the following criteria: (a) population with ACL injury, (b) a measure of brain activity, and (c) a comparison to the ACL-injured limb (contralateral leg or healthy controls). The search yielded 184 articles from which 24 were included in this review. The effect size of differences in brain activity ranged from small (0.05, ACL-injured vs. noninjured limbs) to large (4.07, ACL-injured vs. healthy control). Moreover, heterogeneity was observed in the methods used to measure brain activity and in the characteristics of the participants included. In conclusion, the evidence summarized in this scoping review supports the notion of functional neuroplastic changes in people with ACL injury. The techniques used to measure brain activity and the presence of possible confounders, as identified and reported in this review, should be considered in future research to increase the level of evidence for functional neuroplasticity following ACL injury."

In chronic and revision settings, these injuries may be missed on MRI because of the apparent continuity of nonfunctional PCL fibers. Posterior tibial translation (PTT) of the medial compartment has been identified as a potential secondary finding of PCL tear on routine MRI. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of PTT on MRI associated with PCL injuries and compare it with the sensitivity of a radiologist's MRI interpretation with preoperative posterior knee stress radiographs as the gold standard.

We included any trial that evaluated surgery for ACL reconstruction using any method of reconstruction, type of reconstruction technique, graft fixation or type of graft.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Three review authors independently screened all titles and abstracts for potentially eligible studies, for which we then obtained full-text reports. Two authors then independently confirmed eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. We used the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We identified one study in which 141 young, active adults with acute ACL injury were randomised to either ACL reconstruction followed by structured rehabilitation (results reported for 62 participants) or conservative treatment comprising structured rehabilitation alone (results reported for 59 participants). Built into the study design was a formal option for subsequent (delayed) ACL reconstruction in the conservative treatment group, if the participant requested surgery and met pre-specified criteria.This study was deemed at low risk of selection and reporting biases, at high risk of performance and detection biases because of the lack of blinding and at unclear risk of attrition bias because of an imbalance in the post-randomisation exclusions. According to GRADE methodology, the overall quality of the evidence was low across different outcomes.This study identified no difference in subjective knee score (measured using the average score on four of the five sub-scales of the KOOS score (range from 0 (extreme symptoms) to 100 (no symptoms)) between ACL reconstruction and conservative treatment at two years (difference in KOOS-4 change from baseline scores: MD -0.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) -6.78 to 6.38; N = 121 participants; low-quality evidence), or at five years (difference in KOOS-4 final scores: MD -2.0, 95% CI -8.27 to 4.27; N = 120 participants; low-quality evidence). The total number of participants incurring one or more complications in each group was not reported; serious events reported in the surgery group were predominantly surgery-related, while those in conservative treatment group were predominantly knee instability. There were also incomplete data for total participants with treatment failure, including subsequent surgery. In the surgical group at two years, there was low-quality evidence of far fewer ACL-related treatment failures, when defined as either graft rupture or subsequent ACL reconstruction. This result is dominated by the uptake by 39% (23/59) of the participants in the conservative treatment group of ACL reconstruction for knee instability at two years and by 51% (30/59) of the participants at five years. There was low-quality evidence of little difference between the two groups in participants who had undergone meniscal surgery at anytime up to five years. There was low-quality evidence of no clinically important between-group differences in SF-36 physical component scores at two years. There was low-quality evidence of a higher return to the same or greater level of sport activity at two years in the ACL reconstruction group, but the wide 95% CI also included the potential for a higher return in the conservative treatment group. Based on an illustrative return to sport activities of 382 per 1000 conservatively treated patients, this amounts to an extra 84 returns per 1000 ACL-reconstruction patients (95% CI 84 fewer to 348 more). There was very low-quality evidence of a higher incidence of radiographically-detected osteoarthritis in the surgery group (19/58 (35%) versus 10/55 (18%)).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      For adults with acute ACL injuries, we found low-quality evidence that there was no difference between surgical management (ACL reconstruction followed by structured rehabilitation) and conservative treatment (structured rehabilitation only) in patient-reported outcomes of knee function at two and five years after injury. However, these findings need to be viewed in the context that many participants with an ACL rupture remained symptomatic following rehabilitation and later opted for ACL reconstruction surgery. Further research, including the two identified ongoing trials, will help to address the limitations in the current evidence, which is from one small trial in a young, active, adult population."

All patients went to surgery afterwards. A total of 30 patients suffered from acute or chronic ligament ruptures. There were 20 ACL ruptures, 2 PCL ruptures, 3 MCL ruptures, and 2 LCL ruptures. In patients with ACL ruptures the MRI had a sensitivity of 80%, a specificity value of 80%, and a negative predictive value of 95%; whereas cat-scan had a sensitivity of 90%, a specificity of 95%, an accuracy of 94%, a positive predictive value of 82%, and a negative predictive value of 98%.

The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial is to assess whether a 6-month course of oral montelukast after ACL reconstruction reduces systemic markers of inflammation and biochemical and imaging biomarkers of cartilage degradation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We will enroll 30 individuals undergoing primary ACL reconstruction to participate in this IRB-approved multicenter clinical trial. This trial will target those at greatest risk of a more rapid PTOA onset (age range 25-50 with concomitant meniscus injury). Patients will be randomly assigned to a group instructed to take 10 mg of montelukast daily for 6 months following ACL reconstruction or placebo. Patients will be assessed prior to surgery and 1, 6, and 12 months following surgery. To determine if montelukast alters systemic inflammation following surgery, we will compare systemic concentrations of prostaglandin E2, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokines between groups. We will also compare degradative changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) collected 1 and 12 months following surgery between groups with reductions in early biomarkers of cartilage degradation assessed with urinary biomarkers of type II collagen breakdown and bony remodeling.\n    \n\n\n          Discussion:\n        \n      \n      There is a complex interplay between the pro-inflammatory intra-articular environment, underlying bone remodeling, and progressive cartilage degradation. PTOA affects multiple tissues and appears to be more similar to rheumatoid arthritis than osteoarthritis with respect to inflammation. There is currently no treatment to delay or prevent PTOA after ACL injury. Since there is a larger and more persistent inflammatory response after ACL reconstruction than the initial insult of injury, treatment may need to be initiated after surgery, sustained over a period of time, and target multiple mechanisms in order to successfully alter the disease process. This study will assess whether a 6-month postoperative course of oral montelukast affects multiple PTOA mechanisms. Because montelukast administration can be safely sustained for long durations and offers a low-cost treatment option, should it be proven effective in the current trial, these results can be immediately incorporated into clinical practice.\n    \n\n\n          Trial registration:\n        \n      \n      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04572256 .

The braided polypropylene ligament augmentation device (Kennedy model) was used with temporary double-end fixation in 279 patients to augment the attachment of the anterior cruciate ligament after acute proximal rupture and in 315 patients to augment a bone-tendon-bone autograft, mainly after chronic instability. Check arthroscopy was performed and the metal fixation hardware was removed after a mean of 11 months. Of the 569 patients evaluated, 101 partial or total breakages of the ligament augmentation device were found. Together with nine breakages detected late in the follow-up period, 110 (19.3%) failures were found. Most of these failures were accompanied by effusion that was immediately alleviated when the failed device was removed. No generalized synovitis was visible. Scanning electron microscopic analysis of 24 retrieved failed ligament augmentation devices showed fatigue to be the principal failure mode, together with local abrasion at the fracture. Synovial biopsies were taken during arthroscopy in 84 patients with and without ligament augmentation device-failure who had given informed consent, and histological evaluation revealed that in 21 patients, chronic but no acute synovial inflammation was found, and wear particles could be identified in foreign body cells in 17. Statistically, the presence of chronic synovitis was predicted neither by wear particles and foreign body cells nor by abrasion or fatigue failure of the ligament augmentation device. Irrespective of the failures, for which ligament augmentation device removal is recommended, in the final Orthopaedische Arbeitsgemeinschaft Knie evaluation (after a mean of 6.2 years), excellent and good clinical results were found in 83.6% of all 594 patients."

            "abstract": "The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one the most commonly injured ligaments of the knee. Chronic ACL insufficiency can result in episodic instability, chondral and meniscal injury, and early osteoarthritis. The intra-articular environment of the ligament precludes normal healing and surgical replacement of the injured ligament is often mandated to restore stability. Current surgical strategies include the use of local autograft or allograft tissues for ligament reconstruction. These procedures have yielded superior long-term clinical results yet have the potential for serious associated morbidities. Existing limitations have prompted ongoing research designed to engineer a replacement ligament that will parallel the native ACL in both its biologic properties and mechanical durability. Ligament engineering necessitates the use of appropriate source cells and a growth matrix to support cell proliferation and collagen synthesis. The identification of appropriate growth modulators including both biochemical factors and mechanical stimuli are requisites for successful tissue growth. The characterization of the elements essential for successful graft development represents a significant challenge for investigators. This review examines the current literature regarding the potential and limitations of ligament engineering and describes the development of a novel 3-dimensional scaffold and bioreactor system at our institution."

Ultrasound imaging may provide a cost-effective and portable alternative for imaging the femoral cartilage.

Synovial samples were obtained from 44 patients with chronic ACL deficiency aged 26 +/- 7 years preoperatively, and from some of them, samples were collected for monitoring at 1 month (n = 22), 3 months (n = 17), 6 months (n = 18) and 12s month (n = 18). Synovial fluid taken from 12 contralateral asymptomatic knees of 12 patients (not necessarily opposite knees of ACL-deficient cases) served as controls. Preoperative values were significantly larger than controls (P < 0.05). PF level reached its maximum value in the 1st month (P < 0.05) and then gradually decreased. It was significantly lower than preoperative values at 6 and 12 months but still greater than controls (P < 0.05). It seems that surgical trauma affects cartilage metabolism for the first 3 months postoperatively. Although reconstruction of the ACL contributes to articular cartilage homeostasis, a complete return to normal values cannot be achieved in 1st postoperative year at least in knees with chronic ACL deficiency. Long-term monitoring is needed to see whether these findings are early signs of osteoarthritis.

In this study, we established two OA models in rat knee joints to simulate the two types of OA, using the type II collagenase injection (CI) and anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT), respectively. After intervention for 2-6 weeks, cartilage and subchondral bone changes were detected in histological staining, immunochemistry, and micro-CT. Results showed that both models with typical pathology changes of OA were successfully induced, while the development and severity of OA process in the models were different. In ACLT rats, the cartilage damage was milder, lasted for a shorter time, and subchondral bone reconstruction occurred earlier, compared with the changes in CI rats. The cartilage damage was secondary to subchondral bone change in ACLT rats, while subchondral bone change was secondary to cartilage degeneration in CI rats. In conclusion, the interaction between cartilage and subchondral bone is different between the natural-occurring and secondary OA models. These two models not only suggest potential different mechanisms of the two types of OA, but also provide new directions for OA treatment and prevention."

            "abstract": "BACKGROUNDAssessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) risk after acute kidney injury (AKI) is based on limited markers primarily reflecting glomerular function. We evaluated markers of cell integrity (EGF) and inflammation (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, MCP-1) for predicting long-term kidney outcomes after cardiac surgery.METHODSWe measured EGF and MCP-1 in postoperative urine samples from 865 adults who underwent cardiac surgery at 2 sites in Canada and the United States and assessed EGF and MCP-1's associations with the composite outcome of CKD incidence or progression. We used single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) of AKI patient biopsies to perform transcriptomic analysis of programs corregulated with the associated genes.RESULTSOver a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.8 (4.2-7.1) years, 266 (30.8%) patients developed the composite CKD outcome. Postoperatively, higher levels of urinary EGF were protective and higher levels of MCP-1 were associated with the composite CKD outcome (adjusted HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.95 and 1.10, 95% CI 1.00-1.21, respectively). Intrarenal scRNA-Seq transcriptomes in patients with AKI-defined cell populations revealed concordant changes in EGF and MCP-1 levels and underlying molecular processes associated with loss of EGF expression and gain of CCL2 (encoding MCP-1) expression.CONCLUSIONUrinary EGF and MCP-1 were each independently associated with CKD after cardiac surgery. These markers may serve as noninvasive indicators of tubular damage, supported by tissue transcriptomes, and provide an opportunity for novel interventions in cardiac surgery.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT00774137.FUNDINGThe NIH funded the TRIBE-AKI Consortium and Kidney Precision Medicine Project.

Chronic rotational instability of the knee after damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) fairly quickly produces undesirable secondary changes in the joint. Concomitant damage may affect the meniscus or the articular cartilage of the femoral condyle. The purpose of our study was to compare outcome in patients who had undergone one-stage surgical repair of damage to the ACL and articular cartilage. Material and methods. We studied 17 patients with associated cartilage and ligament damage. The control group consisted of 36 patients with isolated ACL damage. Joint function was assessed according to the Marshall Scale and the Lysholm and Gilquist Scale. Examinations were performed before treatment, 2 and 6 weeks post-operatively, and again 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery. Results. In the course of rehabilitation we observed a slightly slower recovery in the patients with combined damage up to 6 months after surgery. There were no statistically significant differences in rehabilitation outcome at the end of the observation period Conclusions. This treatment method has the potential to permanently remedy knee slippage and cancel its early effects. The surgical outcome in repair of damage to the patellofemoral joint, combined with centralization of the knee's extension apparatus, are comparable at 2 years to centralization of the patella alone when the normal structure of the articular cartilage has been perserved."

The semitendinosus tendon is harvested via a 3 cm skin incision medial to the tibial tuberosity. A four stranded tendon graft is prepared with a minimum length of 6.5 cm. Alternative grafts for this technique are the patellar tendon, quadriceps tendon, and allografts. The femoral tunnel for the ACL graft is drilled via a deep anteromedial portal under arthroscopic control. For precise placement of the guide wire a specific offset aimer is used. For drilling the knee must be flexed more than 110°. Landmarks are the intercondylar line and the cartilage-bone interface. The position of the guide wire is always controlled by the medial portal (medial portal view). The guide wire is overdrilled with a cannulated drill (4.5 mm when a flip tack is used). The drill diameter for the 30 mm long blind tunnel is chosen according to the graft diameter. A gentle tunnel preparation may be achieved with the use of dilators. At the tibia, the anterior horn of the lateral meniscus is used as a landmark in the absence of ACL stump. The guide wire is first overdrilled with a 6 mm drill. Slight adjustments to the tibial tunnel location can be archieved when the guide wire is overdrilled eccentrically with a larger drill.

Such trauma is a strong risk factor for the future development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA). The molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways modulating response to knee joint trauma remain unclear. Moreover, investigations of biomarkers influencing responses have been targeted rather than broad, unbiased discovery studies. Herein, we characterize the complete complement of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in the synovial fluid of 14 subjects following knee injury. Fluid was collected during surgery from the injured knees, and from the contralateral knee in a subset, undergoing surgical repair of the ACL and/or meniscal repair/debridement. Arthroscopic grading of chondral damage in four knee compartments was performed using the Outerbridge classification. exRNA was extracted and subjected to massively parallel total RNA sequencing. Differential abundance of RNA was calculated between the subject cohorts of injured and non-injured knee, average Outerbridge score ≥0.5 and less, and chronic and acute injury duration defined as ≤4 months till surgery or longer. Overall, expression of several thousand genes was identified in the synovial fluid. Furthermore, differential expression analysis suggests a role of exRNA fragments of matrix metalloproteinases and skeletal muscle fiber genes in the response to traumatic injury. Together, these data suggest that high-throughput approaches can indicate exRNA molecular signatures following knee trauma. Future studies are required to more fully characterize the biological roles of these exRNA and the cadence of their respective release that may lead to translational treatment options for post-traumatic OA. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Muscular work/integrated EMG was stable while EMG/t increased. Twenty weeks postoperatively quadriceps area was decreased to 69%, cf. noninjured control. The early postoperative loss of performance was evidently caused by loss of muscle mass. Neuromuscular relearning appears to be a sizable factor in later recovery. Isokinetic training does not offer any specific advantage in the early muscular rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction."

For medial and lateral meniscal damage, respectively, the relative risks were 2.1 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.9) and 1.0 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.5).

Patients with a BMI ≥30 were 21.6% more likely to have a medial meniscus tear with an ACL injury. Grade III and IV chondral lesions correlated with a BMI ≥30 (p = .029). Patient's age predicted medial meniscus outcome (p = .013). Patients whose age was >25 had a 25.7% higher risk of medial meniscus tear. Chronic ACL patients were 52.6% more likely to have a meniscus injury. BMI, age, Tegner activity score, and ACL classification are good predictors of medial meniscus injury. Patients with a BMI ≥30 exhibit a greater risk of medial meniscus tear with ACL instability; however, BMI does not significantly contribute to increased chondral damage in ACL-deficient patients."

MRI signs have been recently reported, but no series gave information about outcomes. It was hypothesized that primary treatment gave better results than delayed management due to frequent misdiagnosis.\n    \n\n\n          Method:\n        \n      \n      This retrospective study focused on 15 patients, managed acutely (n = 7) or delayed (n = 8). The patients' median age at the time of initial injury was 6.5 years (range 5-9). Lysholm, IKDC 2000 subjective scores, and the measurement of the residual laxity by a side-to-side difference with a KT-1000 junior arthrometer were used at the time of revision.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      After a mean follow-up of 9.8 years (range 1-18.5), the mean Lysholm and IKDC subjective scores were, respectively, 97.7 ± 2.6 and 97 ± 3.4.

Suture fixation of the avulsed fragment allows regularly good results when performed acutely or even 4 years after the injury. The hypothesis that primary treatment gives better result than delayed treatment tends to be wrong as 2 failures were reported in each group. An ACL reconstruction was performed in 3 out of the 4 treatment failures. Progressive resorption of the avulsed fragment was noticed in 3 of the 4 failures suggesting an associated ACL resorption.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      CTEF has a good prognosis even after misdiagnosis and treatment at the time of non-union; this could be due to low-energy mechanism of injury and low rate of associated lesion.

The expression of CD31, RAM-11, VEGF, b-FGF, S-100 protein and collagen I, II and III in the bone-tendon interface was very similar to that in the endochondral ossification. Some of the type-III collagen in the outer layer of the graft, which was deposited at a very early phase after the operation, was believed to have matured into Sharpey-like fibres. However, remodelling of the tendon grafted into the bone tunnel was significantly delayed when compared with this ossification process. To promote healing, we believe that it is necessary to accelerate remodelling of the tendon, simultaneously with the augmentation of the ossification."

All findings were verified at arthroscopy. Acute ACL tears (MRI examination was performed within 6 weeks of injury) were typified by the presence of diffuse (58%) or focal (42%) increased signal within the ligament, whereas chronic ACL tears (MRI examination was performed more than 6 months after injury) usually appeared as either a fragmented ligament (44%) or an intact band of low signal with abnormal orientation (30%). Patients with chronic ACL tears had a higher prevalence of medial meniscal tears (78% versus 40%), articular chondromalacia, and an increased posterior cruciate bow ratio (0.47 versus 0.37) in association with chronic ACL tears. A bone bruise was seen in 68% of acute ACL tears but in no case of chronic ACL tear. On MRI, there are salient differences between acute and chronic ACL tears.

Thirty patients with knee joint injuries who came to our hospital for treatment were selected, and all patients were diagnosed with MRI based on deep learning multimodal feature fusion model (MRI group) and arthroscopy (arthroscopy group). The results showed that deep learning-based MRI sagittal plane detection had a great advantage and a high accuracy of 96.28% in the prediction task of ACL tearing. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MRI in the diagnosis of ACL injury was 96.78%, 90.62%, and 92.17%, respectively, and there was no considerable difference in contrast to the results obtained through arthroscopy (P > 0.05). The positive rate of acute ACL patients with bone contusion and medial collateral ligament injury was substantially superior to that of chronic injury. Moreover, the incidence of chronic injury ACL injury with meniscus tear and cartilage injury was notably higher than that of acute injury, with remarkable differences (P < 0.05). In summary, MRI images based on deep learning improved the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ACL injury diagnosis and can accurately determined the type of ACL injury. In addition, it can provide reference information for clinical treatment plan selection and surgery and can be applied and promoted in clinical diagnosis."

We recorded preoperative data for age, sex, weight, height and function (sports, occupational activities). Surgery data concerned delay between severe sprain and surgery, and the exact surgical procedure used (meniscal tear, associated procedure). Clinical assessment (mobility, effusion, clinical and radiological laxity) and functional scores (Tegner, Lysholm, Arpege, IKDC) as well as delay to recovery of gait and to renewed physical activity were recorded at 3 and 6 weeks and 4, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.

Fifteen complications were observed in each group: 4 reflex dystrophies and 2 cyclope syndromes in each group, 5 patellar syndromes in group A and 1 in group B; 3 painful surgical wound sites in group A and 8 in group B (including one requiring revision). In group A there was one early failure due to a surgical error requiring revision. At 1 year, there were 2 cases of persistent femoropatellar syndromes, one of which occurred after reflex dystrophy.

The only reports in the literature have compared different ambulatory rehabilitation programs that appear to be internationally accepted as the routine procedure. The current trend towards short hospital stays for surgery is compatible with outpatient rehabilitation programs if dependent patients receive proper support from an ambulatory medical unit, a physical therapist or a home assistant. Our study demonstrated that the bone-tendon technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is compatible with an outpatient rehabilitation program if quality medical and surgical follow-up is ensured. This type of rehabilitation program gives results comparable with those obtained after inpatient programs conducted in a rehabilitation facility during the first postoperative month."

Our second aim is to analyze the effects of age, time from injury, and both age and time from injury in the presence or absence of accompanying lesions in these patients. The localization and type of the accompanying lesions of 317 knees with complete rupture of the ACL were recorded by the same observer. We applied therapeutic arthroscopy to all patients after their first visit to our clinic. All of the patients were military personnel and their history revealed that they had elected to not restrict their occupational activities after the first trauma causing ACL insufficiency. We defined the first 6 week period after the initial trauma as the acute, 6 weeks to 12 months as the subchronic and 12 months or longer as the chronic period. The average time from injury to arthroscopy for these patients, who were all male, was 19.4 +/- 20.3 months. Eighty-one percent of the patients had at least one meniscal tear, and 45.1% had at least one chondral lesion. The mean ages at the time of surgery of patient groups with or without medial and lateral menisci lesions were compared, and no statistically significant difference was determined. In the chronic period, the relative risk (RR) values of meniscal tears were 7.75 for medial and 2.40 for lateral. The group consisting of patients with chondral lesions was compared with the group of patients without chondral lesions in terms of their ages and the time from injury to arthroscopy, and the difference was statistically significant. The RR value for patients with co-existence of at least two lesions was 1.761 for more than 30 years of age. The RR values for at least two lesions were 2.356 for the subchronic and 14.909 for the chronic group when compared to the acute group.

It is important to note that the combined effects of advanced age and prolonged time from injury in patients who elected to not restrict occupational activities are more severe due to the increase in the occurrence of intraarticular lesions accompanying ACL insufficiency as compared to their separate effects."

Factors which could affect the ATT are graft choice, ACL injury or reconstruction, intra-articular injuries and whether an ACL injury is chronic or acute. Comparison of ATT between studies should be taken with caution as a high number of different measurement methods are used. To be able to compare studies, more consistency in measuring devices used should be introduced to measuring ATT. The clinical relevance is that an autograft ACLR might give better results than an allograft ACLR as knee laxity is greater when using an allograft tendon. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III."

            "abstract": "Introduction:\n        \n      \n      This is a retrospective case report of three cases with an early postoperative transtibial fistula after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACL).\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      The patients had undergone ACL reconstruction and complained of fluid drainage through the not-healed wound or swelling localized on the anteromedial aspect of the ipsilateral proximal tibia during the early postoperative. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a multilocular fluid-filled cyst arising from the distal hole of the tibial bone tunnel. Open resection of the fistula and the cyst was performed in all cases and communication between the tibial tunnel and the joint space was confirmed. During revision surgery the distal hole of the tibial tunnel was covered with a fascio-periosteal flap.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All wounds healed without complications. There was no recurrence of drainage or cyst formation. At 2 years follow-up the knee function was normal and was not affected by the complication in any of the patients. Early postoperative transtibial fistulae after ACL reconstruction are rare complications that clinically present either as anterior tibial cysts or persistent wound drainage. Surgical treatment is required, and some delay in the rehabilitation routine is required, but the final outcome is not affected."

            "abstract": "Our technique of reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligament in both acute and chronic tears, using both the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons, is described in detail. Combined rotatory instabilities were carefully evaluated and corrected during the same operation. Reefing of the posteromedial capsular ligament was done for anteromedial rotatory instability, and for significant valgus instability, the O'Donoghue medial reconstruction was performed. The Ellison procedure was initially done for associated anterolateral rotatory instability, but has been replaced by the Losee procedure. This combination of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with the appropriate extraarticular procedures has produced our most stable knee joints. Posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was also performed through an anterior incision using both the semitendinosus and gracilis tendons. When both cruciates were found to be incompetent, the gracilis was used to reconstruct the posterior cruciate and the semitendinosus for the anterior cruciate. In addition, all associated rotatory instabilities were corrected at the same operation. This technique has been performed on 372 patients (342 anterior and 30 posterior cruciate ligament tears) by one surgeon over a period of five years. The average follow-up was 22 months. Objective comparison of the reconstructed knee with the sound knee showed 84% good results."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      The distal end of the clavicle accounts for 10-28% of all clavicle fractures of which 52.8% are considered displaced and require internal fixation due to their high percentage of non-union. Numerous surgical techniques have been described for the well-known Neer types IIA, IIB, and V. Still, the literature is scarce for the rare \"extralateral\" (type IIC) fracture where the fracture line is located lateral to the completely torn coracoclavicular (CC) ligaments; such small fractures are sometimes not amenable for standard locking plate fixation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We present a series of seven patients treated surgically with closed-looped double button CC stabilization via an open approach. There were four males and three females with a mean age of 31 years (range: 19-46 years). The mechanism of injury was a motor vehicle accident in four cases and a fall from height in three cases. The average time from injury to surgery was 2.7 ± 1.3 days and the average follow-up period was 25.7 months (range: 16-48 months). A custom-made, closed-looped, double button device was made using the ProCinch Adjustable Cortical Fixation for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan) and another standard or slotted button. The fracture was reduced anatomically and the device was tightened and secured with five to six knots. In two cases, additional interfragmentary sutures were used for extra stability. Postoperatively, the arm was immobilized in a simple sling for four weeks; passive assisted elevation up to 90 degrees was allowed from the second postoperative week, followed by active elevation after the sixth postoperative week. Radiological outcomes (bony union, loss of reduction, implant mispositioning, or subsidence of buttons) were assessed using serial plain radiographs. The Constant score (CS) and the Acromioclavicular Joint Instability Score (AJIS) were used for the final clinical evaluation, at least one year postoperatively.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Bony union was achieved in all patients at a mean time of 2.7 months (range: 2.5-3.6 months). No cases of delayed union, loss of reduction, button migration, or subsidence were noted. The mean CS was 96.6 ± 3.4 and the mean AJIS score was 94.1 ± 4.7 in a mean follow-up period of 25.7 months (range: 16-48 months). One patient developed a hypertrophic scar and another had mild skin irritation by the suture knots; no other complications were noted except for one patient who developed an early superficial skin infection managed with antibiotics and debridement under local anesthesia. Four patients who participated in sports before injury were able to regain almost full activity seven to nine months after the operation. All were satisfied with the final result. Two patients showed ossification of the CC ligaments with no significant clinical implications.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although we retrospectively reviewed a small series of patients, we were able to demonstrate a complete rate of fracture union and excellent clinical outcomes with no major complications. Type IIC distal clavicle fractures are rare and require special attention in terms of reduction and optimal fixation. Open CC fixation with closed-looped double buttons is a relatively easy and reproducible technique. We advocate the readjustment of Neer's classification, including \"extralateral\" fractures as a IIC subtype."

Range of motion was measured with a goniometer and joint swelling with a tape measure, preoperatively and at 6 weeks postoperatively. Neither associated injuries nor the age of the patients differed in the two groups. There was no difference in the range of motion between the two groups at 6 weeks' follow-up. Joint swelling was more pronounced in the AM group both preoperatively and at 6 weeks' follow-up. In this investigation the range of motion was not improved by CPM. The difference in joint swelling between the two groups may be explained by a persistent preoperative variation in joint effusion due to an imbalanced distribution of acute and chronic cases."

The mean injury to surgery interval was 9.6 days in 22 patients (acute group) and 22.5 months in 28 patients (chronic group). Objective outcome, which was noted to be more optimal in the acute group, was better than subjective outcome in either group.

Eighty-eight percent of acutely treated patients had a KT-1000 result of < or = 3 mm, as compared to 61% of chronically treated patients (P < 0.001).

Seven patients were operated on acutely (<3 months postinjury), and 4 were treated for chronic conditions. At follow-up, all patients were subjectively and functionally evaluated with a Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale. Average patient age at surgery was 29 years, and average postoperative follow-up was 28.4 months. Average postoperative Lysholm score was 87.7 (range: 49-100). Four of 11 patients reported occasional mild pain, 2 occasional swelling, and 4 infrequent instability. No patient required a postoperative manipulation to regain his or her range of motion and 10 of the 11 returned to their previous activity level postoperatively. Of the 10 patients able to return for clinical examination, 2 demonstrated a loss of flexion <5 degrees compared to the other side, 7 demonstrated a mild postoperative posterior drawer at 90 degrees (6 at 1+, 1 at 2+), 3 demonstrated a positive Lachman (grade 1), whereas no patient demonstrated any posterior lateral corner instability. The average anterior active difference on KT-1000 was 2.6 (range: 0-6). Simultaneous reconstruction of the ACL and PCL, although technically difficult, is feasible and yields good to excellent functional results."

The clinical examination of the recently injured knee must be considered to be unreliable due to pain. In approximately one-third of knee injuries an incorrect or incomplete diagnosis is made. Even if ligamentous injuries can be established, arthroscopy is mandatory, because this is the only sure way in which acute and degenerative meniscal or cartilaginous lesions can be diagnosed. Arthroscopy should be performed under general or spinal anaesthesia to allow the use of a tourniquet and the immediate repair of ligaments if deemed necessary. The experienced arthroscopist needs only a few minutes to obtain information that could influence the approach to the injury and its longterm prognosis. In a series of 1238 arthroscopies 252 (20.3%) were done for haemarthrosis of unknown origin. In 68% of these cases diagnosis could only have been established by arthroscopy. In this series of 252 cases 23% had an isolated complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, 28% had anterior-medical instability, 8% had partial ACL lesions, 5% posterior cruciate ligament injuries, 15% medial collateral ligament injuries, 11% had only synovial tears or contusions. 5% of cases had chronic ACL instability, 4% had osteochondral fragments which could not be diagnosed radiologically.

To evaluate the clinical benefit of intraoperative isometry measurements in ACL reconstruction, we prospectively compared 59 patients (58% acute) in whom isometry was tested (group I) with 35 patients (77% acute) in whom isometry was not tested (group II). All patients underwent arthroscopically assisted ACL reconstruction using autogenous bone-patella tendon-bone graft and interference screw fixation, and were followed-up for a minimum of 24 months (mean, 30 months). With 88% follow-up, no significant differences were found in objective testing, which included the pivot shift test, the Lachman test, KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, and range of motion. A significant difference was found between the two groups when Lysholm scores (P = .04) and Tegner Scores (P = .02) were compared, with group II having higher scores.

These therapies can be used as the principal treatment or as an augmentation procedure (application after surgical repair or reconstruction). Platelet-rich therapies are produced by centrifuging a quantity of the patient's own blood and extracting the active, platelet-rich, fraction. The platelet-rich fraction is applied to the injured tissue; for example, by injection. Platelets have the ability to produce several growth factors, so these therapies should enhance tissue healing. There is a need to assess whether this translates into clinical benefit.\n    \n\n\n          Objectives:\n        \n      \n      To assess the effects (benefits and harms) of platelet-rich therapies for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.\n    \n\n\n          Search methods:\n        \n      \n      We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (25 March 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013 Issue 2), MEDLINE (1946 to March 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 12) and LILACS (1982 to March 2012).

No language or publication restrictions were applied.\n    \n\n\n          Selection criteria:\n        \n      \n      We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared platelet-rich therapy with either placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling or no platelet-rich therapy for people with acute or chronic musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries.

Treatment effects were assessed using risk ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) for continuous data, together with 95% confidence intervals. Where appropriate, data were pooled using the fixed-effect model for RR and MD, and the random-effects model for SMD. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE criteria.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included data from 19 small single centre trials (17 randomised and two quasi-randomised; 1088 participants) that compared platelet-rich therapy with placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling or no platelet-rich therapy. These trials covered eight clinical conditions: rotator cuff tears (arthroscopic repair) (six trials); shoulder impingement syndrome surgery (one trial); elbow epicondylitis (three trials); anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (four trials), ACL reconstruction (donor graft site application) (two trials), patellar tendinopathy (one trial), Achilles tendinopathy (one trial) and acute Achilles rupture surgical repair (one trial). We also grouped trials into 'tendinopathies' where platelet-rich therapy (PRT) injections were the main treatment (five trials), and surgical augmentation procedures where PRT was applied during surgery (14 trials). Trial participants were mainly male, except in trials including rotator cuff tears, and elbow and Achilles tendinopathies.Three trials were judged as being at low risk of bias; the other 16 were at high or unclear risk of bias relating to selection, detection, attrition or selective reporting, or combinations of these. The methods of preparing platelet-rich plasma (PRP) varied and lacked standardisation and quantification of the PRP applied to the patient.We were able to pool data for our primary outcomes (function, pain, adverse events) for a maximum of 11 trials and 45% of participants. The evidence for all primary outcomes was judged as being of very low quality.Data assessing function in the short term (up to three months) were pooled from four trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions and used four different measures. These showed no significant difference between PRT and control (SMD 0.26; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.71; P value 0.26; I² = 51%; 162 participants; positive values favour PRT). Medium-term function data (at six months) were pooled from five trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used five different measures. These also showed no difference between groups (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.39; P value 0.72; I² = 50%; 151 participants). Long-term function data (at one year) were pooled from 10 trials that assessed PRT in five clinical conditions and used six different measures. These also showed no difference between groups (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.57; P value 0.12; I² = 66%; 484 participants). Although the 95% confidence intervals indicate the possibility of a poorer outcome in the PRT group up to a moderate difference in favour of PRT at short- and long-term follow-up, these do not translate into clinically relevant differences.Data pooled from four trials that assessed PRT in three clinical conditions showed a small reduction in short-term pain in favour of PRT on a 10-point scale (MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.41 to -0.48; I² = 0%; 175 participants). The clinical significance of this result is marginal.Four trials reported adverse events; another seven trials reported an absence of adverse events. There was no difference between treatment groups in the numbers of participants with adverse effects (7/241 versus 5/245; RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.59; I² = 0%; 486 participants).In terms of individual conditions, we pooled heterogeneous data for long-term function from six trials of PRT application during rotator cuff tear surgery. This showed no statistically or clinically significant differences between the two groups (324 participants).The available evidence is insufficient to indicate whether the effects of PRT will differ importantly in individual clinical conditions.\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Overall, and for the individual clinical conditions, there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of PRT for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Researchers contemplating RCTs should consider the coverage of currently ongoing trials when assessing the need for future RCTs on specific conditions. There is need for standardisation of PRP preparation methods."

            "abstract": "This study was designed to analyze how anterior tibial tunnel placement can result in graft impingement by the intercondylar roof. The relationship of the ACL to the intercondylar roof was studied using magnetic resonance scans. An attempt was made to predict the amount of bone that may need to be removed from the intercondylar roof to prevent impingement on a 10 mm thick ACL graft. Magnetic resonance scans of 19 normal ACLs were analyzed. The amount of bone removal required to correct roof impingement was determined for a graft placed either eccentrically or centrally within the ACL insertion, and within the bulk of the normal ACL fibers. An eccentric tibial tunnel placement required approximately 5 to 6 mm and a central placement required 2 to 3 mm of bone removal from the intercondylar roof to prevent impingement. Placing the graft within the bulk of the ACL fibers, just 3 mm posterior to the center of the ACL insertion, required little bone resection to prevent impingement. To prevent ACL graft impingement, roofplasties need to be performed in both acute and chronic ACL reconstructions if the presently accepted locations for positioning the tibial tunnel are used. A more anteriorly placed tibial tunnel requires more bone removal to prevent roof impingement than a more posteriorly positioned tibial tunnel."

We analyzed the data of 55 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at our tertiary medical center from 2015 to 2016.

Patients were evaluated at the 3-month, 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year postoperative periods. Surgeon- and patient-reported outcome scores were collected at each follow-up through a systematic questionnaire designed to determine the patient's level of return to sport and reasons for not returning.

The International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective (p = 0.02), symptomatic (p = 0.001), composite (p = 0.005), Tegner (p < 0.001) and Lysholm (p = 0.049) scores at 2-year follow-up were significantly worse in patients who failed to return to sports. Earliest difference in scores manifested at 3-month postsurgery (p = 0.011). IKDC grade-D patients were 18.1 times less likely to return to sports (p = 0.035). Delayed surgery (p = 0.01) and presurgery inactivity (p = 0.023) were negatively predictive of return to sports. The rate of return to sport is consistent with the literature analyzing other ethnic populations. Both surgeon- and patient-reported outcome scores at 2-year postsurgery exhibited significant differences between those who did and did not return to sports. Patients should be advised to seek surgical treatment as soon as possible and stay active preoperatively to maximize return to sports."

However, there is a lack of evidence supporting these suggestions.\n    \n\n\n          Questions/purposes:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this retrospective prognostic study was to assess the predictive value of pre-operative static ATT in knees with ACL injury on return to sport and in satisfaction after ACL reconstruction. Our hypothesis was that greater static ATT would be associated with lower rates of return to sport and lower levels of satisfaction.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Patients treated with ACL reconstruction were identified from an institutional registry and assigned to one of three groups according to their ACL injury type: acute ACL injury, chronic ACL injury, and failed ACL reconstruction.

Ninety-seven patients (74.6%) returned to their primary sport, of whom 63 (65%) returned to the same level of sport. The mean time to return to sport was 10.1 months (range, 2 to 24 months). Overall, 113 patients (87%) were either very satisfied or satisfied with their outcomes. No difference in medial or lateral ATT was found between patients who returned to sport and those who did not. The failed-ACL reconstruction group had significantly lower rates of return to sport than did acutely and chronically injured patients (60.4% versus 88.5% and 75.9%, respectively).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The degree of pre-operative ATT in an ACL-deficient knee was not correlated with return to sport or satisfaction after ACL reconstruction.

            "abstract": "The complex anatomy of the posterolateral corner of the knee is due largely to the evolutionary changes in the anatomic relationships of the fibular head, the popliteus tendon, and the biceps femoris muscle. Recent research has improved our understanding of the popliteus complex, particularly the role of the popliteofibular ligament. Biomechanical studies provide a scientific basis for clinical examination of the knee with suspected injury of the posterolateral corner. All grade-I and most moderate grade-II injuries of the posterolateral structures can be treated nonoperatively, but residual laxity may remain, especially in knees with grade-II injury. Acute grade-III isolated or combined injury of the posterolateral corner is best treated early, by direct repair, if possible, or else by augmentation or reconstruction of all injured ligaments. Chronic injury of the posterolateral corner, whether isolated or combined, is probably best treated by reconstruction of the posterolateral corner along with reconstruction of any coexisting cruciate ligament injury. Failure to diagnose and treat an injury of the posterolateral corner in a patient who has a known tear of the anterior or posterior cruciate ligament can result in failure of the reconstructed cruciate ligament."

These injuries often can be elusive; a significant number of dislocated knees spontaneously reduce and appear relatively benign on routine radiographs. A high index of suspicion, based on the mechanism of injury, soft-tissue assessment of the limb, and the level of knee instability should alert the physician to the possibility of a dislocated knee. Early recognition and appropriate neurovascular assessment is paramount to the successful treatment of these complex injuries. Controversies exist regarding surgical versus nonsurgical management, early versus delayed surgery, the use of allograft versus autograft tissue, the decision to repair versus reconstruct torn ligamentous structures, and the type of reconstruction technique and postoperative rehabilitation program. To achieve optimal patient care, it is important to be aware of the current evaluation and treatment strategies for complex knee ligament injuries, including modern anatomic reconstruction techniques. Current recommendations include measurement of the ankle-brachial indices in each patient, early surgical management, the use of autograft or allograft tissue, reconstruction as opposed to repair alone of the fibular collateral ligament/posterolateral corner structures, reconstruction of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments, and repair and/or reconstruction of the medial collateral ligament/posteromedial corner depending on the injury pattern and the quality of tissue."

At follow-up evaluation (mean of 38 months), only one patient described the reconstructed knee as normal. Six patients had returned to unrestricted sports activities and four had returned to modified sports. The average extension loss was 3 degrees (range, 0 degree to 10 degrees) and average flexion loss was 5 degrees (range, 0 degree to 15 degrees). The KT-1000 arthrometer measurements at 133 N anterior-posterior tibial load showed a mean side-to-side difference of 4.5 mm (range, 0 to 10) at 20 degrees and 5.0 mm (range, 0 to 9) at 70 degrees. The mean Lysholm score was 88 (range, 42 to 100). International Knee Documentation Committee ratings were six nearly normal, five abnormal, and one grossly abnormal. Two patients required manipulations for knee stiffness.

A normal ACL was found in 16.6% (5/30) of patients. In the MRI evaluation of patients with suspected ACL injury the following results were obtained for both acute and chronic complete disruption on orthogonal (sagittal) and nonorthogonal (oblique sagittal) imaging, respectively: sensitivity, 61 (16/26) versus 100%; specificity, 70 (21/34) versus 100%; positive predictive value, 61 (16/26) versus 100%; negative predictive value 70 (24/34) versus 100%; and accuracy, 66 (40/60) versus 100%. In the evaluation of partial ACL injury, four partial tears were correctly diagnosed on nonorthogonal MRI, with one false-positive diagnosis. Orthogonal imaging failed to correctly identify any of the partial ACL injuries. Two patients in the control population demonstrated evidence of chronic ACL tears.

It was a widespread belief that the timing of surgery was an important factor in determining the resulting stiffness after ACLR. Delayed rather than early reconstruction of the ACL is the current recommended treatment since it is thought to give a better functional outcome. However, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the optimal time of surgical intervention. The purpose of this study was to compare the range of motion and functional outcome in patients who underwent ACLR early with those that were delayed.\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe patients were randomized into two groups; patients who underwent the procedure within three weeks were kept in Group I (Early) and those patients who were reconstructed after six weeks were categorized as Group II (Delayed). Hamstring grafts were used and a standard protocol of surgery and physiotherapy was followed. The range of motion, IKDC and Tegner scores were compared.\n## RESULTS\nA hundred and four patients underwent ACLR; fifty-three patients were grouped as Group I (Early) and fifty one as Group II (Delayed). The range of motion of both groups was comparable.

            "abstract": "To evaluate the differential features of acute and chronic tears of the anterior cruciate ligament at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, the authors performed a retrospective evaluation of findings in 81 MR examinations correlated with results at arthroscopy. Intact anterior cruciate ligaments (ACLs) were present in 29 patients; acute complete ACL tears, in 22; and chronic complete ACL tears, in 30. Acute tears were accurately distinguished from intact ligaments and were characterized by the presence of edema. Chronic tears had a more variable appearance: Nine (30%) were depicted at MR as intact bands with low signal intensity that bridged the expected origin and insertion of the ACL. This appearance is likely due to the presence of bridging fibrous scars within the intercondylar notch. Five of these nine cases were correctly characterized as chronically torn because of the presence of focal angulation. In four of these nine cases the scarred fragments produced a relatively straight band that mimicked an intact ligament. Although chronic and acute ACL tears usually have distinct findings at MR, a chronic tear will occasionally be difficult to distinguish from an intact ligament."

            "abstract": "Femoral nerve block (FNB) has been proposed for pain control following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction. Although numerous studies have assessed the efficacy of FNBs, there has been little to no research into the effect of such blocks on postoperative strength and patient-reported outcomes. We hypothesized that performance of an FNB would result in decreased quadriceps strength and poorer patient-reported outcome scores within the first 6 months following ACL reconstruction. A total of 30 patients scheduled to undergo hamstring autograft ACL reconstruction following an acute ACL injury were randomized to a single-shot FNB group or a control group. Preoperatively, patients completed a Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and isokinetic quadriceps strength testing at 60 degrees/second. At 6 weeks postoperative, 29 of 30 patients completed a KOOS and isometric quadriceps strength testing at 90 degrees. At 6 months postoperative, 23 of 30 patients completed a KOOS and isokinetic strength testing. Quadriceps femoris strength limb symmetry indices (QF-LSI) were calculated at all time points. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) models were then utilized to model the effect of FNB and time on QF-LSI as well as KOOS subscales for activities of daily living, pain, and symptoms. QF-LSI and all KOOS subscales demonstrated improvement with time following ACL reconstruction. Repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated that patients who underwent FNB had a mean QF-LSI that was 13.4% lower than the control group (p = 0.005) and poorer KOOS symptoms subscale scores (10.4 point difference, p = 0.032) at 6 weeks postoperative compared with controls. At 6 months postoperative, no differences were noted in QF-LSI or any of the KOOS subscales based on block status. FNB resulted in decreased strength and poorer KOOS symptom subscale score at 6 weeks following ACL reconstruction compared with controls. These differences resolved by 6 months postoperative. The long-term effect of delayed quadriceps recovery on movement patterns and functional outcome remains unknown and requires further study. The study is a randomized controlled trial with level of evidence 1."

However, there are no definitive findings about its effects on chronic joint diseases such as knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of clinical-like cryotherapy on functional impairment and synovial inflammation in a rat model of KOA generated by anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT). Thirty-two male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 8/group): Control, KOA, KOA + Cryotherapy and KOA + Placebo. The last two groups were submitted to the relevant interventions twice a day for five days (61 to 65), with each session lasting 20 min. Gait test, skin temperature, thermal response threshold and joint swelling were assessed in all groups before ACLT surgery, and pre (60th day) and post (66th day) intervention protocols. On day 66, the animals were euthanized and exsanguinated to remove the synovial membrane for histopathological examination and synovial fluid to determine the leukocyte count and cytokine concentration. After the intervention period (66th day), footprint area only increased in the KOA + Cryotherapy group (P = 0.004; 14%) when compared to KOA and KOA + Placebo, but did not differ from controls. Cryotherapy lowered the synovial fluid leukocyte count (P < 0.0001; ≥95.0%) and cytokine concentration (P < 0.0001; ≥55%) when compared to the KOA and Placebo groups. Synovial score and synovial fibrosis did not differ in the KOA groups. In conclusion, footprint patterns improved in rats with ACLT-induced KOA as a result of clinical-like cryotherapy, which also lowered the synovial fluid leukocyte count and inflammatory cytokine concentration in these rats."

We assessed the role of peritendinous connective tissue in the revascularisation of the patellar tendon graft from the day of implantation up to 24 days in a murine model using intravital microscopy. The peritendinous connective-tissue envelope of the graft was either completely removed, partially removed or not stripped before implantation into dorsal skinfold chambers of recipient mice. Initial revascularisation of the grafts with preserved peritendinous connective tissues began after two days. The process was delayed by five to six times in completely stripped patellar tendons (p < 0.05). Only grafts with preserved connective tissues showed high viability whereas those which were completely stripped appeared to be subvital.

The treating physicians recommended further observation although they stated that a knee joint infection could not be reliably excluded. One week later arthroscopic revision was performed and intraoperative smear tests showed infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, another 6 days later the obviously infected transplant had to be removed. In the long run painful and limited range of motion of the affected knee joint persisted. The patient complained about medical malpractice concerning management of the complication. The expert opinion stated that due to the fateful course of infection the tendon graft could not be retrieved after the eighth day post surgery anyway. Thus, only flawed delay of treatment was criticized. The arbitration board argued, however, that scientific data concerning the fate of infected tendon grafts do not support the expert opinion and that immediate arthroscopy and antibiotic treatment at least had the potential to influence the course of infection in a positive manner. Evidence clearly shows that survival of an infected tendon graft depends on early diagnosis and emergency treatment rather than just on fate. Due to the fact that, although having in mind the possibility of a knee joint infection, the necessary therapy was delayed for 8 days, the arbitration board considered the described medical malpractice a severe treatment error, leading to reversal of evidence in favour of the patient."

Patients who had the allograft reconstruction had significantly lower (P < 0.05) anterior-posterior displacements at followup than those who had the extraarticular procedure. We concluded that osteotomy should be performed early in the disease process for younger athletes who experience symptoms with activity. It may be unrealistic, however, to expect continuation of sports beyond light recreational, given the joint arthrosis that is usually present and the high in vivo joint loadings with athletes.

Twenty-two operations were performed in patients with acute injuries (<30 days after trauma) and 6 operations in patients with chronic instabilities (>30 days after trauma).

In addition, 61 procedures (meniscal suture/resection, medial/lateral reconstruction, tendon suture, and open reduction and internal fixation were performed. Postoperative treatment included continuous passive motion and protected weight bearing. Eleven (27% acute, 83% chronic) patients required revision (ACL/PCL reconstruction, osteotomy, and meniscal repair). At follow-up, 43% of the patients were very satisfied and 46% were satisfied. Seventy-one percent (89% preinjury) of the patients were able to maintain intensive and moderate International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) activity levels. The IKDC evaluation of the patients (acute %/chronic cases %) was graded for symptoms: A 39% (45/17), B 35% (27/67), C 15% (18/0), and D 11% (9/17); for range of motion: A 42% (36/67), B 42% (50/17), C 16% (14/17), and D 0%; and for ligaments: A 21% (18/17), B 33% (45/0), C 42% (32/83), and D 4% (5/0). Radiographic findings were A 18%, B 41%, and C 41%. Primary repair of acute injuries was superior to the delayed repair of chronic instabilities. Preservation of cruciate ligaments in acute combined ACL/PCL tears results in a satisfying knee function despite distinct residual ligament instability. Although suture of the cruciate ligaments in open technique is a therapeutic option in acute multiligamentous knee injuries, it is not recommended for the treatment of chronic instabilities."

Surgical alternatives include PLC repair, which involves repair of the lateral collateral ligament, PLT, and/or popliteofibular ligament if structures can be anatomically reduced to their attachment site. However, repair of acute grade-III PLC injuries with staged treatment of concurrent cruciate injuries is associated with a substantially higher postoperative PLC failure rate8-10.\n    \n\n\n          Rationale:\n        \n      \n      Clinical outcomes have demonstrated that primary repairs have significantly higher rates of reoperation compared with reconstruction; therefore, reconstruction is recommended. Treatment of grade-III PLC injuries with reconstruction of midsubstance tears and any associated cruciate ligament tears results in significantly improved objective stability11. In addition, anatomic PLC reconstruction has demonstrated improved subjective and objective patient outcomes compared with nonsurgical treatment or repair5,11,12.\n    \n\n\n          Expected outcomes:\n        \n      \n      Reconstruction of the PLC offers excellent outcomes after surgery.

Patient demographics, surgical characteristics (articular cartilage injury, medial meniscal [MM] and lateral meniscal [LM] tears), and baseline PROM scores (Marx activity rating scale, International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC] subjective form, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS], and Short Form-36 Health Survey [SF-36]) were collected to determine whether the time from injury to ACLR influences (1) baseline PROMs and (2) the pattern and prevalence of concurrent articular cartilage and meniscal injuries. Analysis of covariance models were used to adjust for confounders on baseline outcome scores (age, sex, body mass index [BMI], smoking status, competition level, education).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The median patient age was 23 years (interquartile range [IQR], 17-35 years), 530 (44.5%) were female, and the median BMI was 25.0 kg/m2 (IQR, 22.3-27.9 kg/m2); however, the chronic group was older, had a higher BMI, and consisted of fewer collegiate athletes. A significantly greater number of partial LM tears were seen in the acute group versus the chronic group (14.2% vs 6.5%, respectively; P < .001), but there were more meniscal tears overall (73.5% vs 63.2%, respectively; P = .001), complete MM tears (49.0% vs 22.5%, respectively; P < .001), and articular cartilage injuries (54.0% vs 32.8%, respectively; P < .001) in the chronic group versus the acute group. After controlling for confounders, patients in the chronic ACLR group reported a significantly lower baseline Marx score (7.75 vs 12.10, respectively; P < .001) but higher baseline IKDC, SF-36 physical functioning, and all KOOS subscale scores except the KOOS-quality of life subscale score compared to those in the acute ACLR group; however, only the KOOS-sports and recreation subscale exceeded the minimum clinically importance difference of 8 points (62.30 vs 48.26, respectively; P < .001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      After controlling for age, sex, competition level, smoking, and BMI, patients in the chronic ACLR group participated in less pivoting and cutting sports but reported better pain/function. Whether decreased activity is deliberate after an ACL injury or patients who undergo chronic ACLR are simply less active and may be treated successfully without surgery warrants further investigation. Nonrandomized studies that utilize PROMs should consider time from injury in study design and data interpretation."

Proprioception, Lysholm and Tegner scores as well as stability (KT-1000) were assessed preoperatively, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. A deficit of proprioception was assessed in either group preoperatively, which could be improved after 3 months only in the arthroscopic group. 6 months postoperatively, either group showed a restitution of proprioception near full extension and full flexion of the knee. In the mid range position, the proprioception could not be restored. There were no differences in stability and the Lysholm and Tegner scores between the groups after 6 months postoperatively.

The hypothesis was that this manual test would be diagnostic for both partial and complete tears of the ACL regardless of the elapsed time from injury.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 400 patients were evaluated and divided into four, equal-sized groups based on time elapsed from injury and MRI findings: Group A (acute phase with positive MRI for complete ACL rupture), Group B (chronic phase with positive MRI for complete ACL rupture), Group C (acute phase with positive MRI for partial ACL rupture), and Group D (chronic phase with positive MRI for partial ACL rupture). Clinical assessment was performed with the Lachman test, the Anterior Drawer test, the Pivot Shift test, and the Lever Sign test. The Lever Sign test involves placing a fulcrum under the supine patient's calf and applying a downward force to the quadriceps. Depending on whether the ACL is intact or not, the patient's heel will either rise off of the examination table or remain down. Additionally, the Lever Sign test was performed on the un-injured leg of all 400 patients as a control.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      All tests were nearly 100 % sensitive for patients with chronic, complete tears of the ACL. However, for patients with acute, partial tears, the sensitivity was much lower for the Lachman test (0.42), Anterior Drawer test (0.29), and Pivot Shift test (0.11), but not the Lever Sign test (1.00).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In general, chronic, complete tears were most successfully diagnosed but acute, partial tears were least successfully diagnosed. The Lever Sign test is more sensitive to correctly diagnosing both acute and partial tears of the ACL compared with other common manual tests. The clinical relevance is that some ACL ruptures may be more accurately diagnosed."

A control group was composed of patients with an MRI and intact ACL and FCL. Sensitivity and specificity of diagnosing FCL injuries on MRI were determined based on review by a fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologist, blinded to the pathology associated with each patient (FCL injury vs control), and compared with the gold standard of examination under anesthesia, followed by surgical confirmation of an FCL tear at the time of FCL reconstruction. The sensitivity of diagnosing an FCL injury based on varus stress radiographs was also determined.

Varus stress radiographs were determined to be more sensitive in diagnosing FCL injuries compared with MRI, with an overall sensitivity of 70% compared with 66%, respectively. Based on MRI, overall specificity was 68%. Based on chronicity of the injuries, MRI was more accurate for detecting acute FCL injuries than chronic injuries (P = .002), and varus stress radiographs were more accurate for detecting chronic FCL injuries than acute injuries (P = .041).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results support the use of both varus stress radiographs and MRI in diagnosing FCL injuries, because MRI is more sensitive in diagnosing an acute FCL tear, and varus stress radiographs are more sensitive in diagnosing a chronic FCL tear.

Fifty patients with acute rupture had the synthetic ligament implanted for protection of anterior cruciate repair. Twenty-seven patients had a salvage procedure with the alloplastic ligament functioning as a prosthesis. Both examiners found a statistically significant increase of degenerative arthritis. Patients with acute anterior cruciate tears had a lower degree of osteoarthritis on the day of surgery compared to the patients with chronic insufficiency, but the postoperative increase was identical in both groups. Statistical analysis revealed correlations between osteoarthric changes and several factors such as concomitant meniscus or posterior cruciate injury and demonstrated no correlation to the grade of postoperative stability or injuries to the medial or lateral collateral ligaments or capsule."

Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organising Committee and Session Chairs for the three working groups. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided initial agreement and comments on the statement via online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty per cent agreement was defined a priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative veresus non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached consensus during the symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support; two reached strong consensus; one did not achieve consensus; and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided.In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting and pivoting sports, early anatomical anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomical ACLR is indicated. The consensus statements derived from international leaders in the field will assist clinicians in deciding between operative and non-operative treatment with patients after an ACL injury.Level of evidence: V."

The purpose of this study was to give answers to the following questions: (i) Does (a) the use of a specific tendon graft, and (b) potentially additional therapy of concomitant pathologies influence surgeons’ choice of a distinct postoperative rehabilitation protocol after ACLR? (ii) To what extent do these rehabilitation recommendations differ? Methods: Retrospective analysis of currently used early rehabilitation protocols after ACLR in German-speaking countries (GER, AUT and SUI) was conducted. Rehabilitation criteria included weight bearing, range of motion (ROM), the utilization of braces, continuous passive/active motion therapy (CPM/CAM), rehabilitation training and sport-specific training. Tendon grafts were differentiated as hamstring (HAM) and bone−patellar tendon−bone grafts (BTB). Concomitant pathologies included meniscus injuries (+M) and unhappy triad injuries (+UTI). Results: Most of the surveyed protocols were differentiated according to the used tendon graft or additional therapy of concomitant injuries (ACLR-differentiated, n = 147 vs. ACLR without graft differentiation, n = 58). When comparing ACLR-HAM and ACLR-BTB, significant differences were found regarding weight bearing (p = 0.01), ROM (p = 0.05) and the utilization of braces (p = 0.03). Regarding ACLR+M, an overall significant decelerated rehabilitation could be detected. After ACLR+UTI-therapy, a significant delayed start to full weight bearing (p = 0.002) and ROM (p < 0.001) was found. Conclusions: Most orthopedic surgeons from German-speaking countries differentiate early rehabilitation after ACLR according to the tendon graft used and therapy of concomitant pathologies. No consensus about early rehabilitation after ACLR is available. However, tendencies for an accelerated rehabilitation after ACLR-BTB and a more restrained rehabilitation of multiple injured knees were detected."

One patient assigned to the early ACL-reconstruction group did not attend the 5-year follow-up visit. Patients were randomly assigned to (1) an early ACL reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation group (n = 62, surgery within 10 weeks of injury) or (2) optional-delayed ACL reconstruction plus structured rehabilitation group (n = 59). The primary outcome measure was change in the average of 4 out of 5 subscales of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The authors also assessed crude KOOS (combined 4 subscales), KOOS subscale scores, general physical and mental health (Short-Form 36), activity level (Tegner Activity Scale), mechanical knee stability (Lachman and pivot shift tests), meniscal surgery status, and presence of knee osteoarthritis on radiographs.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Among patients randomized to the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group, 30 (51%) opted for an ACL reconstruction. The treatment groups had comparable 5-year patient-reported outcomes and changes in patient-reported outcomes (eg, knee pain, knee symptoms, activities of daily living, sport and recreational levels, knee-related quality of life, general physical health, and general mental health). Patients in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group had greater mechanical knee instability than patients who received early ACL reconstruction; however, this was primarily among the patients opting for conservative management alone. In the overall sample, 61 knees (51%) required meniscal surgery over 5 years, regardless of treatment group. At 5 years, radiographs were available for 113 patients (93%). Overall, 29 patients (26%) had knee osteoarthritis at 5 years. Specifically, 13 patients (12%) developed tibiofemoral radiographic osteoarthritis (9 patients [16%] in the early ACL-reconstruction group, 4 [7%] in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group) and 22 (19%) developed patellofemoral osteoarthritis (14 patients [24%] in the early ACL-reconstruction group, 8 [15%] in the optional-delayed ACL-reconstruction group). Patients with patellar tendon grafts (n = 40) had a greater incidence of ipsilateral patellofemoral osteoarthritis than patients with hamstrings tendon grafts (n = 51), but the 2 groups had similar incidences of ipsilateral tibiofemoral osteoarthritis. Six knees (5%) had both tibiofemoral and patellofemoral osteoarthritis.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Early ACL reconstruction plus rehabilitation did not provide better results at 5 years compared with optional-delayed ACL reconstruction plus rehabilitation. Furthermore, the authors found no radiographic differences among patients with early ACL reconstruction, delayed ACL reconstruction, or no ACL reconstruction (rehabilitation alone)."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Strong graft-bone integration is a prerequisite for successful graft remodeling after reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) using soft tissue grafts. Novel strategies to accelerate soft tissue graft-bone integration are needed to reduce the need for bone-tendon-bone graft harvest, reduce patient convalescence, facilitate rehabilitation, and reduce total recovery time after ACL reconstruction.\n    \n\n\n          Hypothesis:\n        \n      \n      The application of ACL-derived stem cells with enhanced expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) onto soft tissue grafts in the form of cell sheets will both accelerate and improve the quality of graft-bone integration after ACL reconstruction in a rat model.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Controlled laboratory study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      ACL-derived CD34+ cells were isolated from remnant human ACL tissues, virally transduced to express BMP2, and embedded within cell sheets. In a rat model of ACL injury, bilateral single-bundle ACL reconstructions were performed, in which cell sheets were wrapped around tendon autografts before reconstruction. Four groups containing a total of 48 rats (96 knees) were established (n = 12 rats; 24 knees per group): CD34+BMP2 (100%), CD34+BMP2 (25%), CD34+ (untransduced), and a control group containing no cells. Six rats from each group were euthanized 2 and 4 weeks after surgery, and each graft was harvested for immunohistochemical and histological analyses. The remaining 6 rats in each group were euthanized at 4 and 8 weeks to evaluate in situ tensile load to failure in each femur-graft-tibia complex.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In vitro, BMP2 transduction promoted the osteogenic differentiation of ACL-derived CD34+ cells while retaining their intrinsic multipotent capabilities. Osteoblast densities were greatest in the BMP2 (100%) and BMP2 (25%) groups. Bone tunnels in the CD34+BMP2 (100%) and CD34+BMP2 (25%) groups had the smallest cross-sectional areas according to micro-computed tomography analyses. Graft-bone integration occurred most rapidly in the CD34+BMP2 (25%) group. Tensile load to failure was significantly greater in the groups containing stem cells at 4 and 8 weeks after surgery. Tensile strength was greatest in the CD34+BMP2 (100%) group at 4 weeks, and in the CD34+BMP2 (25%) group at 8 weeks.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      ACL-derived CD34+ cells transduced with BMP2 accelerated graft-bone integration after ACL reconstruction using soft tissue autografts in a rat model, as evidenced by improved histological appearance and graft-bone interface biology along with tensile load to failure at each time point up to 8 weeks after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      A primary disadvantage of using soft tissue grafts for ACL reconstruction is the prolonged time required for bony ingrowth, which delays the initiation of midsubstance graft remodeling. The lack of consistent correlation between the appearance of a \"healed\" ACL on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging and readiness to return to sport results in athletes being released to sport before the graft is ready to handle high-intensity loading. Therefore, it is desirable to identify strategies that accelerate graft-bone integration, which would reduce the time to biologic fixation, improve the reliability of biologic fixation, allow for accelerated rehabilitation, and potentially reduce the incidence of early graft pullout and late midsubstance failure."

Concerning the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)/posterolateral corner (PLC)/lateral collateral ligament (LCL), varus malalignment was considered a significant risk factor for failure.

In cases of failed ACL reconstruction, the tibial slope should be considered, and slope-reducing osteotomies are often helpful in the patient revised multiple times. In cases of chronic PCL and/or PLC instability, osseous correction of the varus alignment may reduce the failure rate and is often the first step in treatment. Changes in the mechanical axis should be considered in all cases of instability accompanied by early unicompartmental osteoarthritis."

Studies in monkeys transplanted with pig organs lacking α-gal epitopes have suggested that anti-non gal antibodies mediate acute and chronic rejection of xenografts. This overview describes studies of these antibodies in patients who received xenografts and includes (1) an ovarian carcinoma patient receiving three intraperitoneal infusions of mouse fibroblasts in a gene therapy study, (2) orthopedic patients with torn anterior cruciate ligament replaced by a ligament made of pig patellar tendon, and (3) diabetic patients receiving fetal pig islet cell clusters xenograft together with a kidney allograft. Anti-non gal antibodies were found to be continuously produced as long as the xenograft was present in the recipient and were directed against a large number of pig proteins. Monitoring the immune response in the recipient of mouse fibroblasts indicated that the production of anti-non gal antibodies is much slower than that of the anti-Gal antibody, suggesting that they are generated by multiple B-cell clones, each initially comprising relatively few cells. Potent immunosuppression to prevent allograft rejection does not fully inhibit the production of anti-non gal antibodies. Much of this antibody response seems to be due to the differences in amino acid sequences between pig and human orthologous proteins as a result of evolutionary mutations. Overcoming the anti-non gal antibody barrier will require immunosuppressive agents that preferentially inhibit this immune response while maintaining protection against pathogens, or alternatively development of methods for induction of immune tolerance to xenogeneic pig antigens."

Arthrofibrosis prevents the patient from regaining full range of motion, particularly the terminal 5 degrees of full extension, postoperatively. We did a retrospective study of 169 acute ACL reconstructions in a population of young athletes (average age, 22 years). We sought to determine the optimal time to perform acute ACL reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis and the effects of an accelerated versus conventional rehabilitation program. The short-term results were evaluated by range of motion measurements and 13 week Cybex scores. Patients whose ligaments were reconstructed within the 1st week after injury (Group I) had a statistically significant (P less than 0.05) increased incidence of arthrofibrosis (limited extension, scar tissue) over patients who had ACL reconstruction delayed 21 days or more (Group III). At 13 weeks after the reconstruction procedure, Group III patients scored an average of 70% (compared to 51% for Group I, P less than 0.05) on the Cybex evaluation. They also showed a trend toward more flexion of the knee as well as near full extension. Patients who had an ACL reconstruction between 8 and 21 days after injury (Group II) had a similar incidence of arthrofibrosis as Group I when they followed a conventional rehabilitation program postoperatively. However, only a small number of cases (approximately 4%) of Group II patients who followed an accelerated postoperative rehabilitation program had any arthrofibrosis--an observation we also made in the Group III patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Sixty-four patients out of a much larger population who presented within 2 weeks of an acute injury to the knee were found at arthroscopy to have either a chronic tear or chronic incompetent anterior cruciate ligament (group I, 32 patients) or to have an acutely torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (group II, 32 patients). Arthroscopy of both groups allowed the author to compare and contrast the lesions found in each group. Chondromalacia of the femorotibial joint is significantly more frequent in chronic ACL-deficient knees (p less than 0.05), and there is a tendency to degenerative meniscus lesions and chondromalacia patella in these knees too."

            "abstract": "The pivot shift test and its various modifications has been well described for evaluation of chronic anterolateral rotatory insufficiency of the knee. Fifty knees with acute traumatic hemarthrosis were examined under general anesthesia to assess the reliability of the pivot shift in the acute injury. The pivot shift test as described by Galway and MacIntosh was employed. No patients with a history of previous knee injuries were included. Arthrotomy or arthroscopy was performed following the examination in all cases. There were 38 knees with positive shifts, 35 with complete anterior cruciate tears, and 3 with significant partial tears or attenuation of the ligament. The 12 knees with negative shift demonstrated five normal anterior cruciates, five partial tears and two complete tears of the anterior cruciate. Both of the complete tears were associated with complete medial collateral ligament tears and were clinically apparent by drawer and Lachman tests. A positive pivot shift in this study was very accurate for significant anterior cruciate tears. A negative pivot shift ruled out complete anterior cruciate ligament tears but did not preclude the presence of a partial tear. Partial tears associated with a negative pivot shift retained ligament competence. We conclude that: (1) the pivot shift is a direct test of cruciate competence; (2) the pivot shift is present acutely in a very high percentage of cases and does not necessarily develop over time; (3) the pivot shift exam performed under general anesthesia is a very reliable test for significant tears of the anterior cruciate; and (4) the arthroscope remains a useful tool in the evaluation of acute traumatic hemarthrosis, but is not always necessary in establishing competence of the anterior cruciate ligament."

A combined intra- and extra-articular transfer (consisting of the central one-third of the patellar tendon, the prepatellar tissue, and the central one-third of the quadriceps tendon) is necessary to repair ACL instability. Augmentation of the autogenous transfer with polylactic acid-coated carbon fibers has several advantages. It improves the transfer's strength by reinforcing its weak zones; gives initial strength during graft remodeling and vascularization, thus avoiding cast immobilization; and allows early active rehabilitation and possibly return to sports activity. The surgical technique is based on biomechanical and biologic principles. The transfer remains attached to the tibial tubercle, passing through a tibial tunnel, through the intercondylar notch, behind the lateral femoral condyle in a bony groove, then on the lateral aspect of the condyle, beneath the lateral collateral ligament, and ending close to Gerdy's tubercle. The preliminary results in 30 patients are encouraging. The subjective and objective results are similar to those previously obtained with nonreinforced methods of repair, except that there is an early return to normal activities."

We identify the pannexin-1 (Panx1) channel as a therapeutic target for alleviating mechanical allodynia, a cardinal sign of arthritis. In rats, joint pain caused by intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) was associated with spinal adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) release and a microglia-specific up-regulation of P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs). Blockade of P2X7R or ablation of spinal microglia prevented and reversed mechanical allodynia. P2X7Rs drive Panx1 channel activation, and in rats with mechanical allodynia, Panx1 function was increased in spinal microglia. Specifically, microglial Panx1-mediated release of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) induced mechanical allodynia in the MIA-injected hindlimb. Intrathecal administration of the Panx1-blocking peptide 10panx suppressed the aberrant discharge of spinal laminae I-II neurons evoked by innocuous mechanical hindpaw stimulation in arthritic rats. Furthermore, mice with a microglia-specific genetic deletion of Panx1 were protected from developing mechanical allodynia. Treatment with probenecid, a clinically used broad-spectrum Panx1 blocker, resulted in a striking attenuation of MIA-induced mechanical allodynia and normalized responses in the dynamic weight-bearing test, without affecting acute nociception. Probenecid reversal of mechanical allodynia was also observed in rats 13 weeks after anterior cruciate ligament transection, a model of posttraumatic osteoarthritis. Thus, Panx1-targeted therapy is a new mechanistic approach for alleviating joint pain."

The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database was queried to identify all patients who underwent ACLR from 2005 to 2012. Demographic variables, resident participation, 30-day complications, and intraoperative time parameters were assessed for all cases. Resident and nonresident cases were matched using propensity scores. Outcomes were analyzed using univariate and multivariate regression analyses, as well as stratified by resident level of training. Univariate analysis of 1,222 resident and 1,188 nonresident cases demonstrated no difference in acute postoperative complication rates between groups. There was no significant difference in the incidence of overall complications based on resident level of training (p = 0.109). Operative time was significantly longer for cases in which a resident was involved (109.5 vs. 101.7 minutes; p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified no significant predictors of major postoperative complications, while patient history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was the only independent risk factor associated with minor complications. Resident involvement in ACLR was not associated with 30-day complications despite a slight increase in operative time.

In all samples there were 65 metabolites quantified, of which six could be suggested as biomarkers for early post-injury degenerative changes in the knee joints: isobutyrate, glucose, hydroxyproline, asparagine, serine, and uridine. Our results raise a cautionary note indicating that surgical interventions into the knee can result in metabolic alterations that need to be distinguished from those caused by the early onset of OA. Our findings illustrate the potential application of metabolomics as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for detection of injuries to the knee joint. The ability to detect a unique pattern of metabolic changes in the synovial fluid of sheep offers the possibility of extending the approach to precision medicine protocols in patient populations in the future."

Article quality was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 checklist.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 353 studies were assessed for eligibility, 347 were excluded for the following reasons: injuries were not assessed in an acute trauma setting, injuries were not acute, participants had previous ACL injuries or chronic joint deformities affecting the knee, participants were under 18, or participants included animals or cadavers. A total of six studies were included in the review. Common assessment methods included: laxity tests, joint effusion, inability to continue activity, and a history of a 'pop' and 'giving way' at the time of injury. Diagnostic accuracy varied greatly between the assessment method and the assessing clinician. Gold standard diagnostics were MRI and arthroscopy. A weighted meta-mean calculated the time to reach diagnosis to be 68.60 days [CI 23.94, 113.24]. The mean number of appointments to reach diagnosis varied from 2-5. Delay to surgery or surgical consultation ranged from 61 to 328 days.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Clinicians in the Emergency Department are not proficient in performing the assessment methods that are used for diagnosis in acute ACL injury. Reliance on specialist assessments or radiological methods inevitably increases the time to reach a diagnosis, which has repercussions on management options.

ACL reconstruction surgeries are therefore increasingly being performed. Despite the fact that most patients achieve excellent postoperative results, patients can present with recurrent instability and pain. These patients often undergo imaging with radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or computed tomography. An understanding of the imaging appearance of the normal ACL reconstruction and common causes of failure is therefore essential for the interpreting radiologist. This article reviews surgical techniques for ACL reconstruction, highlighting recent technical advances, the normal imaging appearance after ACL reconstruction, etiologies for reconstruction failure, and the diagnosis of these with the aid of imaging."

An arthroscopic examination of the medial meniscus was performed, and modified Outerbridge grades were assigned to the central and posterior medial femoral condyle (cMFC and pMFC, respectively) of ACL-reconstructed patients. Two years after ACLR, 16 patients underwent the same 3-T MRI. UTE-T2(*) maps were generated for the posterior medial meniscus (pMM), cMFC, pMFC, and medial tibial plateau (MTP).

            "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is the most common ligament injury in the knee, and a significant number of patients may develop progressive instability and disability despite aggressive rehabilitation. Various materials have been used for its reconstruction. These include autografts, allografts, prosthetic ligaments, and synthetic augmentation of the biological tissue. The concept of ligament augmentation device (LAD) arose from the observation that biological grafts undergo a phase of degeneration and loss of strength before being incorporated. The LAD is meant to protect the biological graft during this vulnerable phase. However, it provokes an inflammatory reaction in the knee, and has been found to delay maturation of autogenous graft in humans. In experimental situations, the LAD has been found to share loads in a composite graft. It has also been found to be substantially stronger than the biological graft. However, in clinical situations no significant advantages have been observed with the use of LAD to augment patellar tendon or hamstring reconstruction of the chronic ACL-deficient knee or in the acute setting to augment repair of the torn ACL. There are very few reports of the use of LAD in reconstruction of the posterior cruciate ligament, and again these do not suggest any advantage in its use. Insertion of the LAD implies the introduction of a foreign material into the knee, has been associated with complications such as reactive synovitis and effusions, and may also be associated with an increased risk of infection. At present, there is no evidence that its routine use should be advocated in uncomplicated reconstructions of the ACL using biological grafts."

            "abstract": "Knee dislocations are rare and potentially devastating injuries. Significant displacement of the tibia and femur commonly disrupts multiple knee ligaments and also often results in profound disruption to the surrounding soft tissue envelope. Open wounds and neurologic and vascular insult can put the involved limb in jeopardy. Following reduction, the optimal management of the dislocated knee is unknown. Surgery to repair and/or reconstruct torn structures likely affords superior long-term function over nonoperative immobilization strategies. The role of early versus delayed surgery, repair versus reconstruction, and autograft versus allograft tissue for reconstruction remain topics of debate. High-quality research efforts to investigate these controversies are hampered by the heterogeneous nature of the injuries themselves and the many treatment strategies available."

A mean of 7 years had elapsed between the original injury and the reconstruction, and 102 prior operative procedures had been done in 34 of the 40 patients. A total of 64 articular cartilage lesions were noted; 34 knees had lesions in the medial or lateral tibiofemoral compartment. Postoperatively, all had immediate motion and early functional rehabilitation. The results were assessed using the Cincinnati Knee Rating System. At follow-up (mean, 37 months), significant improvements were found for pain, giving-way, and functional limitations with daily and sports activities (P < .01). Fifty-five percent had returned to mostly light athletics (avoiding high impact sports) based on our advice and were asymptomatic. The mean overall rating scores significantly improved (P < .0001, mean improvement 22 points).

Due to eligibility criteria and procedures in our cohort, we can only generalize our model to athletes without major concomitant injuries who follow a similar treatment algorithm. Concomitant meniscal injuries and new knee injuries were important factors in the unfavorable Low and High Before Declining trajectories.

            "abstract": "Resolution of inflammation is defective after spinal cord injury (SCI), which impairs tissue integrity and remodeling and leads to functional deficits. Effective pharmacological treatments for SCI are not currently available. Maresin 1 (MaR1) is a highly conserved specialized proresolving mediator (SPM) hosting potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties with potent tissue regenerative actions. Here, we provide evidence that the inappropriate biosynthesis of SPM in the lesioned spinal cord hampers the resolution of inflammation and leads to deleterious consequences on neurological outcome in adult female mice. We report that, after spinal cord contusion injury in adult female mice, the biosynthesis of SPM is not induced in the lesion site up to 2 weeks after injury. Exogenous administration of MaR1, a highly conserved SPM, propagated inflammatory resolution after SCI, as revealed by accelerated clearance of neutrophils and a reduction in macrophage accumulation at the lesion site. In the search of mechanisms underlying the proresolving actions of MaR1 in SCI, we found that this SPM facilitated several hallmarks of resolution of inflammation, including reduction of proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL3, CCL4, IL6, and CSF3), silencing of major inflammatory intracellular signaling cascades (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, p38, and ERK1/2), redirection of macrophage activation toward a prorepair phenotype, and increase of the phagocytic engulfment of neutrophils by macrophages. Interestingly, MaR1 administration improved locomotor recovery significantly and mitigated secondary injury progression in a clinical relevant model of SCI. These findings suggest that proresolution, immunoresolvent therapies constitute a novel approach to improving neurological recovery after acute SCI.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Inflammation is a protective response to injury or infection. To result in tissue homeostasis, inflammation has to resolve over time. Incomplete or delayed resolution leads to detrimental effects, including propagated tissue damage and impaired wound healing, as occurs after spinal cord injury (SCI). We report that inflammation after SCI is dysregulated in part due to inappropriate synthesis of proresolving lipid mediators. We demonstrate that the administration of the resolution agonist referred to as maresin 1 (MaR1) after SCI actively propagates resolution processes at the lesion site and improves neurological outcome. MaR1 is identified as an interventional candidate to attenuate dysregulated lesional inflammation and to restore functional recovery after SCI."

In Group I, there were 68 meniscal repairs in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and in Group II, 22 isolated repairs in anterior cruciate ligament stable knees. Meniscal healing was assessed using the criteria established by Henning, by either arthroscopy or arthrography, at a mean of 7 months for isolated repairs and a mean of 10 months for repairs done in conjunction with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Average time from injury to surgery was 19 months in Group I patients, and 14 months in Group II patients. The overall rate of successful healing was 82%. Group I repairs were successful 93% of the time compared to a 50% success rate in Group II (P less than 0.00005). Lateral meniscal repairs fared better than medial repairs in both groups. Although a smaller rim width yielded better overall healing, there was no difference in the mean rim width of the two groups. Patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction did better than those with isolated meniscal repair, regardless of tear length. Older patients had better healing than younger ones. Overall, acute repairs were more successful than repairs of chronic tears. Even so, the chronic Group I patients had a 91% successful healing rate."

The time from injury to surgery ranged from 1 week to 6 years. Twenty-five percent of the injuries were considered acute, i.e., less than 6 weeks after the injury, and 75% of the injuries were considered chronic. Nineteen patients (27%) had isolated meniscus injuries. All meniscus repairs were done arthroscopically, using an inside-outside technique. Ligament stabilizing procedures were done on all patients who had ACL deficient knees. Forty-seven patients (67%) had postoperative documentation including either an arthroscopic examination or an arthrogram done an average of 5 to 6 months after surgery. There was one case of peroneal nerve palsy from which the patient made a complete recovery in 6 months. There was one case of infection/thrombophlebitis. One patient had paresthesia and numbness along the medial aspect of the left leg corresponding to a saphenous nerve injury. The aim of this investigation was two-fold, consisting of determining if an arthroscopic technique could be used successfully to repair acute as well as chronic vertical tears involving the meniscus, and also, evaluating the relationship between ACL stability and meniscus healing. The overall success rate of retained menisci following repair was 91%. The time from injury to repair did not affect meniscus healing.

They are strongly associated with acute and chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. These lesions have gained much prominence in recent years, due to a significant increase in their diagnosis and their important biomechanical involvement in the knee. It is known that their presence in ACL-deficient knees is related to instability and if they are not repaired during ACL reconstruction, they can ultimately cause the failure of the graft. Since this type of injury is often underdiagnosed due to its localization at the \"blind\" point of arthroscopic vision, it is crucial to make an accurate preoperative diagnosis of them with MRI. The objective of this article is to review the recent literature regarding meniscal ramp lesions and to summarize the anatomical, biomechanical and fundamentally diagnostic aspects, emphasizing the radiological findings described until now."

Anatomoradiological studies showed that the posterior border of the lateral condyle corresponded with the third of a circle and that the center of this circle was named the \"isometric point\" (F). The variations of the intra-articular length of a ligament between the point F and the center of the A.C.L. tibial attachment did not exceed 2 mm. A radiological study on 50 normal patients knees X-Rayed at 0 degree and 90 degrees of flexion showed a length dependence of 1.5 mm in 84% and 2 mm maximum in 98%. Twenty patients with acute or chronic A.C.L. rupture were operated on; the isometric point F was determined by superimposing a template of circles on the posterior border of the condyle. An original guide allowed to drill a bony tunnel with a pin emerging at the exact previous point F. A per-operative X-Ray studied the good reliability of this guide. The measurements of the variations of length of the ligament between 0 degree and 110 degrees of flexion varied less than 5% in 18 patients, which confirms the good isometry of the reconstruction. On the basis of these data, we propose to improve the implantation of autogenous or synthetic ligament in A.C.L. reconstruction by the use of a pre-operative determination of the isometric femoral point and the use of a guide able to drill easily a bony tunnel at this exact pre-determined point."

The present study compared patient-reported outcomes between the sexes after a minimum of 2 years following arthroscopic ACL reconstruction using bone-patellar tendon-bone autograft. Patients were also categorized as acute or chronic based on the time from injury to surgery. Outcome questionnaires were mailed to 638 patients, resulting in 151 eligible respondents included in the analysis. The outcome instruments used were the Cincinnati scale, the ACL-Quality of Life scale, and the Tegner activity rating scale. At an average of 5 years following ACL reconstruction no differences were found between males (n=74) and females (n=77) on the ACL-QOL scale. Females perceived a significantly higher activity level prior to surgery according to the Tegner scale. However, no other differences were identified by gender or stage based on prior, highest, or current Tegner activity levels. Results of the Cincinnati scale for the entire sample showed that females scored an average of 5.7 points lower than males. Analysis of this difference by patient age indicates a trend toward lower scores in females between 12-18 and over 24 years old. Chronicity was not a factor that affected outcome in either males or females. No differences were found in the number of patients who complained of anterior knee pain.

Many preventable surgical and nonsurgical etiologic factors have been identified. Accurate placement of the tibial tunnel, adequate notchplasty, and the routing of the femoral side of the graft are all critical factors. Several studies report that early range-of-motion therapy emphasizing immediate postoperative \"hyperextension\" and avoiding immobilization in flexion reduces the rate of loss of extension. Initial studies investigating the effect of acute versus chronic ACL reconstruction suggested that acute reconstruction is associated with a higher rate of loss of extension. However, the authors of two recent studies in which modern techniques were used have disputed this conclusion. It is likely that the loss of extension historically seen with acute ACL reconstructions was related to tibial tunnel placement and postoperative immobilization. It is possible that the timing of acute ACL reconstruction has less of an effect than originally postulated. On the basis of the results of several biomechanical studies, it appears that ACL reconstruction may be performed with the knee in full extension during graft placement with excellent results and a very low rate of loss of extension. Use of the descriptive term \"loss of extension\" is preferred to the often misleading terms \"arthrofibrosis\" and \"flexion contracture.\""

            "abstract": "Meniscal injury is common in acute or chronic anterior cruciate ligament insufficiency. The patterns of meniscal lesions are predictable in the acute and chronically unstable knee. The early incidence of meniscal injury is high and increases with time. Meniscal repair has become increasingly successful. Techniques for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction have also improved, and with more progressive rehabilitation programmes, this has become a more tolerable procedure for both patients of highly athletic lifestyles and more moderate recreational athletes. The decision-making process for the sports medicine physician requires an overall assessment of many variables. A delicate balance of factors such as age, sex, joint laxity, activity level, individual motivation, social circumstances, associated meniscal, collateral ligament and/or chondral damage may sway the surgeon towards a nonoperative or operative decision. At the present time, a 'cook book' answer to each case presented is not available. As in all of medicine, each patient is an entity that requires an individual evaluation and a specific course of treatment. This review aims to help in this decision-making process. Future prospective studies investigating the many variables mentioned will hopefully objectively delineate guidelines for the choice of the most effective therapeutic regimen."

Delay in ACL reconstruction has been in variably linked to increase in these injuries but there is lack of consensus regarding optimal timing of reconstruction. The goal of this study was to investigate delay in surgery and other factors, associated with intraarticular injuries in ACL deficient knees.\n    \n\n\n          Materials and methods:\n        \n      \n      A total of 438 patients (42 females; 396 males) enrolled for this prospective observational study.

Reported incidence of arthrofibrosis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction ranges from 4% to 35%.

Comorbidities (simultaneous presence of two or more medical conditions) may be acquired from changes in activity levels and lifestyle after an injury and/or treatment. This study aimed to compare differences in comorbidity proportions between surgical and nonsurgical approaches in Military Health System beneficiaries who had concurrent cruciate and meniscus injuries. The retrospective case control design included 36-month data that were analyzed to reflect 12 months prior to injury/surgery and 24 months after injury/surgery. A comparison of differences within and between groups in surgical and nonsurgical approaches was calculated and logistic regression was used to determine if surgery increased or decreased the odds of comorbidities at 24 months. In our sample of 2,438 individuals with concurrent meniscus and cruciate injury, 79.1% (n = 1,927) received surgical intervention and 20.9% (n = 511) elected for nonoperative management. All comorbidities demonstrated significant within-group differences from pre- to postsurgery for those with a surgical intervention; approximately, half the comorbidities increased (i.e., concussion or traumatic brain injury, insomnia, other sleep disorders, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and tobacco abuse disorder), whereas the other half decreased (i.e., chronic pain, apnea, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, mental health other, depression, and substance abuse disorders). The odds of acquiring a comorbid diagnosis after surgery reflected the bivariate comparisons with half increasing and half decreasing in odds.

We sought to determine what effect, if any, an isolated articular cartilage defect observed at the time of ACL reconstruction would have on the radiographic, subjective, and objective results after surgery if no intervention was performed on the cartilage lesion itself.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      From 1987 to 1999, 2770 ACL reconstructions were performed, and 125 of them were done in patients who had an articular cartilage defect of Outerbridge grade 3 or 4 but had both menisci intact.

Postoperative rehabilitation was not altered because of the chondral defect, and patients were allowed full weight-bearing and the full range of motion of which they were capable.

This procedure involves an advancement and reefing of the POL and adherent posterior capsule to the stout tissue of the intact medial collateral ligament, potentially using suture anchors if the POL tissue is detached from bone. Additionally, in cases of residual laxity, the semimembranosus tendon may be advanced anteriorly to improve dynamic stabilization. This procedure appears to be useful in cases of moderate posteromedial insufficiency and avoids retrieval of a medial tendon graft from the region of the medially stabilizing hamstrings or from the healthy contralateral side."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a rapidly developing orthopaedic field and an area of notable clinical equipoise. The optimal timing of surgery in an acute (< 3 weeks) or delayed (≥ 3 weeks) time frame remains unresolved with a 2010 meta-analysis concluding no difference between these two groups across multiple outcomes. In an era of evidence-based medicine, surgeons are still basing their decisions on when to operate on little more than anecdotal evidence and personal preference. Clear guidance is required to determine whether the timing of surgery can optimise outcomes in this largely young and active patient cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A systematic literature search was performed in January 2018 of Embase, Medline and OpenGrey in accordance with (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 658 articles were retrieved, with 6 suitable for inclusion, covering 576 ACL reconstructions. Four meta-analyses were performed assessing subjective measures of Tegner activity scale and Lysholm score, and objective measures of arthroscopically identified meniscal and chondral injury. Additional relevant outcome measures underwent narrative review. Study bias was assessed and reported using the Downs and Black checklist.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A statistically significant difference of 0.39 points was found on the Tegner activity scale in favour of early surgery within 3 weeks (RR 0.39, CI 0.10, 0.67, p = 0.008). No statistically difference was found between groups for the patient-reported Lysholm score (RR - 0.18, CI - 2.40, 2.05, p = 0.17). There was no statistically significant difference between groups for intra-operative findings of meniscal lesions (RR 0.84, CI 0.66, 1.08, p = 0.17). A trend towards significance was observed for the incidence of chondral lesions in the early surgery group (RR 0.56, CI 0.31, 1.02, p = 0.06). All the studies were rated either fair or good on the Downs and Black checklist with no study excluded due to bias.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Although there was a statistically significant result for the Tegner activity scale in favour of early surgery, the magnitude of the effect is unlikely to translate into any clinically meaningful difference. At present, there remains no clear evidence to determine superiority of acute/early or delayed reconstruction of a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. Further research through methodologically robust randomised controlled trials or through the UK National Ligament Registry may help to provide clearer guidance."

Stability and the scores on the grading system of Lysholm and Gillquist were excellent in the first postoperative year; the results worsened due to complications occurring in the second year of follow-up. There were no differences in the results between patients who had a closed procedure and those who had an open procedure.

The increase in the understanding of the function of the ligament is described and in the light of this experience a programme for the management of these lesions is suggested. In acute lesions in a young sportsman the loss of the stability provided by the central pivot prevents competition at high level and operation to repair, substitute, or reinforce the ligament is recommended. In the older athlete non-intervention may be acceptable in view of the knowledge that the adverse mechanical consequences of a rupture of the ACL may be lessened by appropriate rehabilitation. Such measures may be successful for a couple of years, but usually, within five years, functional symptoms will appear. In patients who are middle aged, or those with no competitive need, rehabilitation only is usually adequate, and surgical reconstruction is rarely necessary. In chronic lesions operation should probably only be undertaken when instability is a notable problem. Reconstruction may be accomplished by an autograft using a bone patella bone, semi-membranosis or semi-tendonosis transfer, allograft substitution or a prosthesis."

Kinematic data were recorded for the lower limb. The muscles examined include vastus lateralis and medialis, biceps femoris and adductor longus. The results obtained from the injured subjects were compared with those of 51 individuals without ACL damage. The acute ACL-deficient patients exhibited a quadriceps avoidance pattern prior to and 6 weeks after surgery. The quadriceps avoidance phenomenon does not develop in chronic ACL-deficient patients. In the individuals operated on, the spatial-temporal parameters and the knee angle had already regained a normal pattern for the ACL-deficient limb during gait 4 months after surgery. However, the relative ACL movement parameter-which describes the tibial translation into the direction of ACL-and the EMG traces show no significant statistical difference compared with the values of healthy control group just 8 months after surgery. The results suggest that: (1) development of a quadriceps avoidance pattern is less common than previously reported, (2) anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and reconstruction significantly alter the lower extremity gait pattern, (3) the gait parameters shift towards the normal value pattern, and (4) the re-establishment of pre-injury gait patterns--including the normal biphase of muscles--takes at least 8 months to occur."

Although immediate-release oral opioids are usually effective in relieving moderate to severe pain, they must be given every 4-6 h. A controlled-release (CR) formulation of oxycodone maintains therapeutic opioid concentrations for a more prolonged period, thus providing sustained pain relief. We designed this study to determine whether CR oxycodone is more effective and clinically acceptable than immediate-release oxycodone for managing pain after ambulatory ACL repair surgery. All patients received a standard general anesthetic and postoperative analgesic regimen with one of three oxycodone dosing regimens: oxycodone 10 mg every 4 h as needed, oxycodone 10 mg every 4 h, and CR oxycodone 20 mg every 12 h. Rescue analgesic consisted of oxycodone 5 mg every 6 h as needed. At 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h, there was a difference in pain scores among the groups (P < 0.0001); there was less pain in the CR oxycodone group. At most times, the fixed-dose group had lower pain scores than the as-needed group. The sedation scores were significantly different at 12 h (P < 0.02) and at 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h (P < 0.0001); the patients were more alert in the CR oxycodone group.

            "abstract": "It has been recommended that reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in skeletally immature patients should not violate the physeal plate of the distal femur or proximal tibia as growth irregularity might occur. Despite the lack of conclusive evidence that tendon transfers through growth areas cause growth irregularity, recent reports suggest that ligament reconstruction be performed in a nonisometric fashion to avoid violating the growth plate. Eight skeletally immature individuals underwent ligament reconstruction (average age: 14 years 9 months) and were reviewed retrospectively at an average of 32 months postsurgery. Surgery was performed using a hamstring tendon autograft through femoral and tibial tunnels (7 to 9 mm). Seven patients underwent scanograms at follow-up to confirm skeletal limb equality. All patients had at least 2 cm longitudinal growth after surgery. Stability tests were performed using both manual and KT-1000 arthrometer measurements. No clinically significant limb-length discrepancy or angular deformity was observed. Stability was excellent in five patients (< 3 mm side-to-side difference) and 8 mm in a patient with a repeat injury. Two patients presented with contralateral ACL-deficient knees. All eight patients were able to return to the same sport as before the injury. Modified Cincinnati Knee Rating scores revealed 100% excellent results in those four patients acutely reconstructed with average postoperative scores of 98 points. The four patients with chronic tears also exhibited average postoperative scores of 98 points. Ligament reconstruction using the semitendinosus and gracilis autograft can give excellent results in the skeletally immature individual. There appears to be minimal risk to the growth areas of the tibia or the femur at the knee. The graft can be safely passed through anatomically accurate bony drill holes in an arthroscopic fashion without apparent damage."

            "abstract": "Injuries to the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) and posterolateral corner of the knee, particularly when combined with anterior cruciate or posterior cruciate ligament injuries, can result in profound symptomatic knee instability. Although many surgical improvements have been made in the reconstruction of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries, reconstruction of the posterolateral corner has had less predictable results, with residual pathologic laxity especially in the chronic situation. This has stimulated many surgeons to recommend acute repair of posterolateral knee injuries. This article will briefly review the relevant surgical anatomy, present a summary of current reconstructive techniques for the posterolateral corner, and describe our preferred method for anatomic reconstruction of the posterolateral corner for chronic instability of the knee by recreating the LCL and popliteofibular ligament using either autogenous or allograft soft tissue and an interference screw technique. We do not use a transtibial tunnel but re-orientate the transfibular tunnel and utilize 2 femoral tunnels an the attempt to recreate the LCL and popliteus tendon. In a small clinical series, this has proven to restore varus rotation and external rotation patholaxities with a high degree of predictability."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Anterior cruciate ligament injury arises when the knee anterior ligament fibers are stretched, partially torn, or completely torn. Operated patients either end up re-injuring their reconstructed anterior cruciate ligament or majority develop early osteoarthritis regardless of the remarkable improvements of surgical techniques and the widely available rehabilitation best practices. New mechanism theories of non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury and delayed onset muscle soreness could provide a novel perspective how to respond to this clinical challenge.\n    \n\n\n          Main body:\n        \n      \n      A tri-phasic injury model is proposed for these non-contact injuries. Mechano-energetic microdamage of the proprioceptive sensory nerve terminals is suggested to be the first-phase injury that is followed by a harsher tissue damage in the second phase. The longitudinal dimension is the third phase and that is the equivalent of the repeated bout effect of delayed onset muscle soreness. Current paper puts this longitudinal injury phase into perspective as the phase when the long-term memory consolidation and reconsolidation of this learning related neuronal injury evolves and the phase when the extent of the neuronal regeneration is determined. Reinstating the mitochondrial energy supply and 'breathing capacity' of the injured proprioceptive sensory neurons during this period is emphasized, as avoiding fatigue, overuse, overload and re-injury.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Extended use, minimum up to a year or even longer, of a current rehabilitation technique, namely moderate intensity low resistance stationary cycling, is recommended preferably at the end of the day.

            "abstract": "Restoring knee stability through reconstruction, while providing symptomatic relief, has not been shown to decrease the incidence of degenerative changes after rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. This suggests that posttraumatic osteoarthritis may not be purely biomechanical in origin, but also biochemical. To test this, we measured the levels of seven cytokine modulators of cartilage metabolism in knee joint synovial fluid after anterior cruciate ligament rupture. We also measured keratan sulfate, a product of articular cartilage catabolism. The sample population consisted of patients with uninjured knee joints (N = 10), and patients with acute (N = 60), subacute (N = 18), and chronic (N = 8) anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knees. Synovial fluid samples were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Normal synovial fluids contained high levels of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist but low concentrations of other cytokines. Immediately after ligament rupture there were large increases in interleukins 6 and 8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and keratan sulfate. Interleukin-1 levels remained low throughout the course. As the injury became subacute and then chronic, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and keratan sulfate levels fell but remained considerably elevated 3 months after injury. Concentrations of interleukin-1Ra fell dramatically. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor concentrations were normal acutely and subacutely but by 3 months after injury were elevated 10-fold. Our data reveal a persistent and evolving disturbance in cytokine and keratan sulfate profiles within the anterior cruciate ligament-deficient knee, suggesting an important biochemical dimension to the development of osteoarthritis there."

Neglected injuries have a direct impact on the prognosis due to residual instability, chronic pain, deformities, and failure to repair other structures. Several techniques are used to reconstruct the posterolateral corner, often with autologous ischiotibial grafts or homologous grafts. An option little used for knee ligament reconstructions is the peroneus longus tendon graft. Although reported as a good alternative for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, we found no case using a peroneus longus tendon graft for posterolateral corner reconstruction. Here, we describe the case of a patient who underwent a non-anatomical reconstruction of the posterolateral corner using a peroneus longus tendon graft. The patient underwent surgical procedures for ligament reconstruction and correction of the deformity caused by a failed graft, but his knee remained unstable. During the preoperative planning, it was decided to reconstruct the posterolateral corner with an ipsilateral peroneus longus tendon graft. Studies have shown that the peroneus longus tendon graft does not increase ankle morbidity, and that its length and diameter favor ligament reconstruction. Thus, the present article highlights the importance of the proper diagnosis of ligament injuries in the acute phase, and describes a new technique for posterolateral corner reconstruction that must be included in the surgeon's body of knowledge, increasing the amount of technical options."

The use of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been studied in muscle rehabilitation programs following anterior cruciate ligament repair. Accelerated recovery and pain reduction were noted. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of electrical stimulation on maintaining calf muscle cross-sectional area volume and improving patient reported outcome measures following Achilles tendon surgery. Randomized controlled clinical trial. Forty patients were enrolled. All patients had undergone repair of the Achilles tendon. A 4 lead NMES device was applied at time of surgery with both patient and surgeon blinded to activity of the device. All patients followed a standardized postoperative protocol. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who received protocol specific NMES. Group 2 was the \"sham device\" control group, receiving subtherapeutic electrical stimulation. Preoperative and postoperative calf circumference (2, 6, 12 weeks) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (2, 6 weeks) were conducted. Patient-reported functional outcome scores were measured. Of the 40 patients, 23 (57.5%) were male and 17 (42.5%) were female. The mean age was 48.9 years (11.1 standard deviation [SD]) with a mean body mass index of 32.2 kg/m2 (5.7 SD). Calf measurements for Group 1 (39.3 cm and 39.7 cm) were slightly higher compared Group 2 (38.4 cm and 39.2 cm) at 6 and 12 weeks postoperative.

Similarly, the prevalence of cartilage injury was equivalent between groups after correcting for age (P=0.167). Among primary ACL-R, there were more medial meniscus repairs in the acute surgical group compared to the chronic group (60.6% vs. 24.2%, P=0.003).

Age appears to play an important role in whether concomitant pathology develops following ACL rupture. Given these findings, early intervention may increase the ability to repair medial meniscus tears in the setting of ACL-R, but this conclusion is less supported in primary ACL-R.Level of Evidence: II."

Most procedures are carried out on an outpatient basis, and though success rates of ACLR are as high as 95%, pain remains the most common postoperative complication delaying patient discharge, and thereby increasing the costs associated with patient care. Despite the success and relative frequency of ACLR surgery, optimal and widely accepted strategies and regimens for controlling perioperative pain are not well established. In recent years, the paradigm of pain control has shifted from exclusively utilizing opiates and opioid medications in the acute postoperative period to employing other agents and techniques including nerve blocks, intra-articular and periarticular injections of local anesthetic agents, NSAIDs, and less commonly, ketamine, tranexamic acid (TXA), sedatives, gabapentin, and corticosteroids. More often, these agents are now used in combination and in synergy with one another as part of a multimodal approach to pain management in ACLR, with the goal of reducing postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and the incidence of delayed hospital discharge. The purpose of this review is to consolidate current literature on various agents involved in the management of postoperative pain following ACLR, including the role of classically used opiate and opioid medications, as well as to describe other drugs currently utilized in practice either individually or in conjunction with other agents as part of a multimodal regimen in pain management in ACLR."

Preclinical and clinical studies investigated ACL repairing techniques in skeletally immature subjects. However, intra-articular bioenvironment following ACL tear has not yet been defined in skeletally immature patients. The aim of this study was to measure cytokine concentrations in the synovial fluid in adolescent population. Synovial levels of IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and TNF-α were measured in 17 adolescent patients (15 boys) with ACL tears who underwent ACL reconstruction including acute (5), subacute (7), and chronic (5) phases. Femoral growth plates were classified as \"open\" in three patients, \"closing\" in eight, and \"closed\" in six. Eleven patients presented an ACL tear associated with a meniscal tear. The mean Tegner and Lysholm scores (mean ± SD) of all patients were 8 ± 1 and 50.76 ± 26, respectively. IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels were significantly greater in patients with \"open\" physes. IL-1ra and IL-1β levels were significantly higher in patients with ACL tear associated with a meniscal tear. Poor Lysholm scores were associated with elevated IL-6 and IL-10 levels. IL-10 levels positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-8 levels, whereas TNF-α concentration negatively correlated with IL-6 levels. Skeletally immature patients with meniscal tears and open growth plates have a characteristic cytokine profile with particularly elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-1β. This picture suggests that the ACL tear could promote an intra-articular catabolic response in adolescent patients greater than that generally reported for adult subjects. The study lacks the comparison with synovial samples from healthy skeletally immature knees due to ethical reasons. Overall, these data contribute to a better knowledge of adolescent intra-articular bioenvironment following ACL injuries."

Except intraarticular fractures, stress fractures of the proximal tibia, as a result of lower extremity malalignment, need earlier treatment to prevent the dislocation of the fragments. Damage to the articular cartilage needs earlier treatment due to its tendency to involve wider area of the joint. Meniscus rupture is not an indication for earlier treatment, except a \"bucket handle\" rupture due to its potential to block the movements of the knee joint.

Different operative techniques to replace the anterior cruciate ligament using exclusively autologous, homologous or heterologous grafts in all cases of chronic instabilities, but the primary sole suture of acute ACL injuries, too, didn't show long-term stable results in many cases. Recurrent ruptures were found first of all at the intraarticular edge of the femoral tunnel caused by permanent abrasions of the replacement. The reason why is the large angle of the ACL and each replacement respectively under motion. The question of what tissue could or should be used for renewed autogenous reconstructions in case of re-instabilities and after using bone-tendon-bone-mid-third patellar-tendon-grafts isn't yet been discussed to the end. Because of the fact that there is no isometric behaviour of the complete ACL but of a few fibres only depending on the position of the knee the complete reconstruction of the ACL is absolutely impossible, but only a partial substitute. The anatomically limited intraarticular joint-space (notch) confines the replacements in their dimension and endangers voluminous reconstructions by an impending impingement especially as a result of the immediately postoperative swelling of the transplants. The use of the mid-third-patellar-tendon-graft destroys a lot of proprioceptors and causes a partly loss of the neuromuscular balance previously impaired by the loss of the ACL including its receptors. In addition to this the still existing proprioceptors of the ligamentous stumps can be definitively destroyed by big tunnels. Each autologous graft passes a long-term transformation and at best achieves to 50% of the maximum stress capacity of an original ACL after two years. Resulting from these reasons synthetic and unlimited-ly available ligaments presented themselves to be used for ACL replacements. The Trevira-ligament of polyethylenetherephthalat (= TRE-VIRA HOCHFEST 730R) seems to be best qualified therefore at the present. It meets the material and technical requirements and makes allowance for all biomechanical knowledge. A modified over-the-top technique by arthroscopy or mini-arthrotomy (minimized operative trauma) enables the preservation of still existing ligamentous tissue on the one hand and guarantees the immediate postoperative functional therapy on the other hand. A recurrent instability independent of cause doesn't bring about a worse starting position for the following renewed stabilization and enables corrective operative techniques including the substitute of a ruptured synthetic ligament if required."

            "abstract": "We presented a case of a 25-year-old woman with early posttraumatic degenerative change to the articular cartilage accompanied with valgus malalignment despite receiving anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction after a multiligamentous injury sustained 2 years earlier. Rapid deteriorating valgus malalignment may result from chronic instability and intra-articular bone loss. Simultaneous distal femoral varus osteotomy and posterolateral complex reconstruction were performed during a single surgery. Six months after the surgery, the patient could walk briskly and climb stairs without any discomfort. Salvage procedures and biological reconstruction could be the primary choice for young patients to recover their knee function while avoiding joint replacement."

            "abstract": "Medial-sided knee injuries can result in pain, instability, and loss of function. Many clinical studies have been written on the treatment of medial-sided knee injuries; however, the vast majority are isolated case series of surgical or nonoperative treatment regimens, and only a few randomized prospective clinical trials can be found in the literature that compare different treatment modalities. Comparison of these treatments is challenging due to the variety of medial-sided structures that can be involved, the multiple different approaches to treatment, and the variability of how objective and subjective clinical outcomes are reported. In this paper we report on the injuries by extent and type of anatomic structures damaged including partial medial-sided injuries, completed isolated medial-sided knee injuries, and combined injuries. In general, most authors concur that isolated partial or complete medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries can be treated nonoperatively with a brace and early motion with good clinical outcomes. Prospective, randomized trials support nonoperative treatment of the MCL in combined anterior cruciate ligament-MCL injuries. Knee dislocations and posterior medial corner injuries appear to have better results with surgical management including reconstruction. Multiple reconstructive techniques have been described for chronic injuries but it is difficult to compare their results."

This study aimed to determine whether longer wait times are associated with a prolonged decrease in quality of life and an increased incidence of secondary joint injury after ACL rupture.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      We recruited 53 patients who presented between 2013 and 2017 at a single sports medicine minor injury clinic with a suspected acute ACL rupture, based on clinical examination; ACL rupture was confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging. Patients were randomly allocated to undergo early reconstruction (< 12 wk after injury) or reconstruction after a regular wait time (≥ 12 wk). We compared scores on the ACL quality of life measure (ACL-QOL) and the incidence of secondary knee injury at baseline and at surgery between the 2 groups. Participants also completed the Tegner scale (level of activity) at the time of consent and within 7 days before surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Twenty-eight patients were randomly assigned to the early surgery group and 25 patients to the regular wait time group. There was no difference in mean age between the 2 groups. There were no between-group differences in mean ACL-QOL score at the time of injury (28.5 [standard deviation (SD) 12.5] v. 28.5 [SD 12.6]) or at surgery (34.9 [SD 17.5] v. 38.0 [SD 17.5]). The mean wait time was significantly longer in the regular wait time group than in the early surgery group (29.6 wk [SD 13.2 wk] v. 10.6 wk [SD 5.1 wk], p = 0.001). In both groups, Tegner scale scores were significantly lower after than before ACL rupture (p < 0.001) and remained low while patients waited for surgery. There were no between-group differences in the incidence of chondral or meniscal injury at surgery, although the study was not adequately powered to draw any statistical conclusions.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Wait time for ACL reconstruction may affect patients' quality of life, as it remained diminished for a longer period when surgery was delayed. A low activity level during the waiting period was observed in both groups; this low activity level may be one reason why no between-group differences in the incidence of secondary injury were observed. The findings suggest that patients with a limited activity level during the waiting period have a low risk of secondary injuries."

Lewis rats underwent unilateral ACL transection and were divided into three groups as follows: (1) no further treatment (ACLT; n = 10); (2) an intra-articular injection of EMBC on day 0 (INJ0; n = 11); and (3) an intra-articular injection of EMBC on day 14 (INJ14; n = 11). Ten additional animals received capsulotomy only (n = 10, SHAM group). The OARSI histology scoring of the tibial cartilage and micro-CT of the tibial epiphysis were performed after 35 days. The ratio of intact/treated hind limb forces during gait was determined using a variable resistor walkway. The OARSI cartilage degradation sum score and total degeneration width were significantly greater in the ACLT group when compared to the INJ0 (p = 0.031, and p = 0.005) and INJ14 (p = 0.022 and p = 0.04) group. Weight bearing on the operated limb only decreased significantly in the ACLT group (p = 0.048). In the rat ACL transection model, early or delayed injection of EMBC ameliorated the significant decrease in weight bearing and cartilage degradation seen in knees subjected to ACL transection without injection. The results indicate that the injection of EMBC may slow the process of PTOA following ACL injury and may provide a promising treatment for PTOA. © 2015 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Surgical treatment offers good functional results documented in the literature by physical examination, arthrometer testing, stress radiography, and knee ligament rating scales. Mechanical tensioning devices are helpful with cruciate ligament tensioning. Some low grade medial collateral ligament (MCL) complex injuries may be amenable to brace treatment, while high grade medial side injuries require combined surgical repair-reconstruction. Lateral posterolateral injuries are most successfully treated with combined surgical repair-reconstruction. Surgical timing in acute multiple ligament injured knee cases depends on the ligaments injured, injured extremity vascular status, skin condition of the extremity, degree of instability, and the patients overall health. Allograft tissue is preferred for these complex surgical procedures. Delayed reconstruction of 2 to 3 weeks may decrease the incidence of arthrofibrosis, and it is important to address all components of the instability. Currently, there is no conclusive evidence that double-bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) reconstruction provides superior results to single-bundle PCL reconstruction in the multiple ligament injured knee. The purpose of this article is to discuss G.F.'s surgical technique for combined PCL and anterior cruciate ligament, medial, and lateral side reconstructions in acute and chronic multiple ligament injured knees with global laxity. This article will focus on recognizing and defining the instability pattern, the use of external fixation, surgical timing, graft selection and preparation, G.F.'s preferred surgical technique, mechanical graft tensioning, perioperative antibiotics, specialized operating teams, postoperative rehabilitation, and our results of treatment in these complex surgical cases."

Therefore, the authors investigated the potential of a preoperatively induced heat injury to predict subsequent postoperative pain ratings in patients undergoing knee surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Twenty patients were studied. The burn injury was induced 6 days before surgery with a contact thermode (12.5 cm2, 47 degrees C for 7 min). The sensory testing, before and 1 h after the injury, included pain score during induction of the burn, secondary hyperalgesia area, thermal and mechanical pain perception, and pain thresholds. Postoperative analgesia consisted of ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Pain ratings (visual analog scale) at rest and during limb movement were followed for 10 days after surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The burn injury was associated with development of significant hyperalgesia. There was a significant correlation between preoperative pain ratings during the burn injury and early (0-2 days, area under the curve) and late (3-10 days, area under the curve) postoperative dynamic pain ratings during limb movement.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      The results of this study suggest that the pain response to a preoperative heat injury may be useful in research in predicting the intensity of postoperative pain. These findings may have important implications to identify patients at risk for development of chronic pain and to stratify individuals for investigations of new analgesics."

            "abstract": "The high incidence of cruciate ligament injuries as a result of acute knee trauma with hemarthrosis and abuse of diagnostic arthroscopies call for a suitable radiological imaging of the central pivot. Computed Arthrotomography (CAT) was used to examine the knee joint in 20 cases of clinically suspected chronic cruciate ligament injury. The images were correlated with arthroscopic and/or arthrotomic findings. Thirteen lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) (65%) were found, plus 1 lesion of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) (5%), 2 associated lesions of ACL + PCL (10%), and 4 normal cases. Confirmation of pathology was available in all cases but one by arthroscopy and/or surgery. The central pivot diseases were classified as follows: absence, detachment, partial or complete tear. CAT findings of cruciate ligament injuries are emphasized and the role of the technique as compared to arthroscopy is discussed. CAT is useful in 3-D evaluation of central pivot and detection of different cruciate ligament injuries, with high sensitivity-specificity for ACL and high specificity-moderate sensitivity for PCL. In the evaluation of the chronic unstable knee, CAT is highly accurate and gives the surgeon useful information towards the planning of therapeutic procedures. CAT is almost non-invasive, well tolerated and easy to perform in out-patients, which make it a first-choice procedure in the screening of chronic ligament injuries."

Evidence supporting best-practice guidelines for the management of ACL injury is to a large extent based on studies with low-level evidence. An international consensus group of experts was convened to collaboratively advance toward consensus opinions regarding the best available evidence on operative versus nonoperative treatment for ACL injury. The purpose of this study was to report the consensus statements on operative versus nonoperative treatment of ACL injuries developed at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019. There were 66 international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, who were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the scientific organizing committee and session chairs for the 3 working groups. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements before the meeting and provided initial agreement and comments on the statement via online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Ultimately, 80% agreement was defined a priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative versus nonoperative treatment of ACL injury reached consensus during the symposium. Overall, 9 statements achieved unanimous support, 2 reached strong consensus, 1 did not achieve consensus, and 1 was removed because of redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports, early anatomic ACL reconstruction is recommended because of the high risk of secondary meniscal and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight-plane activities, nonoperative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomic ACL reconstruction is indicated. The consensus statements derived from international leaders in the field will assist clinicians in deciding between operative and nonoperative treatment with patients after an ACL injury."

In 2006, about 130,000 patients were admitted to hospital for meniscal surgery and 35,000 for ACL surgery in France.

The current trend is towards use of hybrid implants (fixation material combined with suture wire) and an exclusively arthroscopic technique. (ii) Traumatic meniscal lesions do not always require a meniscectomy; no surgery or meniscal repair should systematically be considered. (iii) The assessment and management of non-traumatic degenerative meniscal lesions depend on the extent of cartilage damage. (iv) All ACL ruptures do not require reconstructive surgery. The indication for reconstruction is based on symptoms, in particular functional instability. As far as acute ACL injuries are considered, reconstruction by arthroscopy should preferably be delayed to reduce the thromboembolic events or joint stiffness. (v) Bone-tendon-bone graft and hamstring tendon reconstruction give similar results. (vi) Lateral tenodesis should be limited to specific cases."

IKD needs careful pre-operative planning. There is no universal agreement about the appropriate surgical strategy for IKD. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy, safety, and outcome of the two-staged operation in treatment of IKD. Methods: IKD patients were included from June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2020. In the stage-1 surgery, acute reduction and extra-articular structure repair were performed. Following an intermediate rehabilitation, delayed cruciate ligament reconstructions were performed in stage-2. Physical examination, CT, MRI, and X-ray were performed during the pre-operative period. Knee function, joint stability, ligament laxity, knee range of motion (ROM), and alignment were accessed at follow-ups. The minimum and maximum follow-up times were 0.5 years and 1 year, respectively. Results: In total, 17 IKD patients were included. There were three subjects (17.65%) missing at the 1 year follow-up and the average follow-up was 11.18 ± 2.53 months. After stage-1, normal alignment and superior valgus/varus stability were restored in most subjects; however, a notable anterior-posterior instability still existed in most patients. The intermediate rehabilitation processed smoothly (6.94 ± 1.20 weeks), and all patients achieved knee ROM of 0-120° finally. At 0.5 years and 1 year follow-up after stage-2, all subjects had achieved normal knee stability, ROM, and satisfying joint function. No infection or DVT was observed. Conclusions: The two-staged operation for IKD has superior efficacy on knee stability and function, and it can facilitate the rehabilitation and achieve satisfactory short-term outcome."

            "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury induces maladaptive vascular responses that degrade medial collateral ligament (MCL) function. The purpose of this study was to determine if early or delayed ACL reconstruction can prevent or reverse the abnormal changes in vascular function that occur in the uninjured MCL after ACL injury. Twenty-four rabbits were divided into four groups (n = 6); control, ACL-deficient (ACL-X), immediate ACL reconstructed (ACL-IR) and delayed ACL reconstructed (ACL-DR). After 8 weeks, MCLs were assessed for blood flow, responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and phenylephrine (Phe) and autoregulatory responses, using laser speckle perfusion imaging. In ACL-X knees, blood flow in the MCL increased by 2.5-fold compared to control. MCL hyperemia was diminished in ACL-DR knees and was unaltered in ACL-IR knees. MCL vasculature was unresponsive to ACh and Phe in ACL-X. These responses were partially restored by ACL reconstruction. Autoregulatory responses were not significantly different between groups. ACL-DR decreased hyperemia in the MCL and partially attenuated abnormal MCL vascular responses. ACL-IR was more effective at preventing MCL hyperemia and preserving vascular responsiveness to ACh and Phe. This suggests that the vascular alterations in the uninjured rabbit MCL are largely caused by abnormal mechanical loading resulting from ACL deficiency and can be prevented through early reconstruction. Early ACL reconstruction could limit the progression of microvascular dysfunction of the MCL, and preserve physiological joint homeostasis. This might prevent joint degeneration and delay the progression of osteoarthritis."

Bone bruises with subchondral or osteochondral injuries, or geographic bone bruises seemed to be persistent for years after trauma on MRI. Biopsy samples of the articular cartilage overlying the bone bruise lesions showed degeneration or necrosis of chondrocytes and loss of proteoglycan. Experimental studies using a single impact load revealed chondrocytes death, alteration of the mechanical properties of cartilage explants and/or an increase in the thickness of subchondral bone. These data are indicative of a significant injury to normal articular cartilage homeostasis, and support the suggestion that severe bone bruise is a precursor of early degenerative changes. We recommend delaying return to full weightbearing status when a severe bone bruise is detected to prevent further collapse of subchondral bone and further aggravation of articular cartilage injury."

Of 800 patients who underwent intraarticuar ACL patellar tendon-bone graft reconstruction, performed by the same surgeon, the last 450 patients have followed the accelerated rehabilitation schedule as outlined in the protocol. A longer than 2 year followup is recorded for 73 of the patients in the accelerated rehabilitation group. On the 1st postoperative day, we encouraged these patients to walk with full weightbearing and full knee extension. By the 2nd postoperative week, the patients with a 100 degrees range of motion participated in a guided exercise and strengthening program. By the 4th week, patients were permitted unlimited activities of daily living and were allowed to return to light sports activities as early as the 8th week if the Cybex strength scores of the involved extremity exceeded 70% of the scores of the noninvolved extremity and the patient had completed a sport-specific functional/agility program. The patient database was compiled from frequent clinical examinations, periodic knee questionnaires, and objective information, such as range of motion measurements, KT-1000 values, and Cybex strength scores. A series of graft biopsies obtained at various times have revealed no adverse histologic reaction. The evidence indicates that in this population, the accelerated rehabilitation program has been more effective than our initial program in reducing limitations of motion (particularly knee extension) and loss of strength while maintaining stability and preventing anterior knee pain.

Seventy-two patients with anterior cruciate ligament ruptures who were active in sports requiring sidestepping and pivoting, or who had recurrent episodes of giving way, underwent arthroscopic bone-patellar tendon-bone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. These patients were evaluated for meniscal damage and osteoarthritic changes at the time of surgery and followed up for 7 years. Fifty-three patients underwent radiographic evaluation at 7 years, which included anteroposterior, lateral, skyline, and 30 degrees posteroanterior weightbearing views. Radiographic evaluation was performed by three independent surgeons and graded as per International Knee Documentation Committee criteria. Results revealed that knees with chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency, even those with intact menisci before reconstruction, suffered early osteoarthritic changes.

In all, 10 (18%) of the tears had failed clinically and 11 (19%) appeared unhealed on postoperative imaging. The mean International Knee Documentation Committee score improved significantly from 62 preoperatively to 81 postoperatively (P<0.001). Patients with concurrent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction had better corresponding scores postoperatively than preoperatively (mean, 83 vs 65, P<0.001). The clinical and radiological outcome was not related to the chronicity, location or length of the tear, or patient age.

Multiple physeal respecting techniques have been described to address this vulnerable population; however, none restore the native ACL attachments while keeping the graft and fixation entirely in the epiphysis.\n    \n\n\n          Description of technique:\n        \n      \n      We describe a technique of all-epiphyseal ACL reconstruction for use in prepubescent skeletally immature patients. Intraoperative CT scanning with three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction was used to confirm the precise localization of the all-epiphyseal femoral and tibial tunnels. The femoral tunnel is drilled entirely in the epiphysis of the lateral femoral condyle. The tibial tunnel is drilled from inside-out to the level of the tibial physis using a retrograde drill.

Acute and chronic injuries involving the cruciate ligaments have typical appearances and associated findings. MR imaging interpretation must take into account atypical injuries and imaging pitfalls.

            "abstract": "Augmentation by autogenous tissue in the repair of acute anterior cruciate ligament injury has been found to be of benefit in providing a scaffold for the disrupted tissue and a stent to protect the repaired tissue, thereby ultimately increasing the strength of the repair. In both the acute setting and when autogenous tissue is used to reconstruct a chronic anterior cruciate-deficient knee, the substitute tissues require protection while revascularization and recollagenization take place. Potential solutions to these problems are sought in a ligament prosthesis, such as carbon fibers, that would be capable of providing both a stent for protection and an inducement for collagen ingrowth. Intra-articular reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with autogenous tissue augmented by PLA-coated carbon fibers was performed in one group of ten patients. A second group of matched cases was similarly treated but without augmentation for controls. The results were analyzed at one year postoperation on both the 100-point protocol rating system and the authors' 200-point knee rating system. On the 100-point scale, the study group improved by 14.8% of the preoperative rating, while the comparison group improved by 23.3%. On the 200-point system, the study group improved by 21.9%, the comparison group by 22.6%.

Studies compared ketamine with placebo, or compared ketamine plus a basic analgesic, such as morphine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with a basic analgesic alone.\n    \n\n\n          Data collection and analysis:\n        \n      \n      Two review authors searched for studies, extracted efficacy and adverse event data, examined issues of study quality and potential bias, and performed analyses. Primary outcomes were opioid consumption and pain intensity at rest and during movement at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes were time to first analgesic request, assessment of postoperative hyperalgesia, central nervous system (CNS) adverse effects, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of findings' table.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      We included 130 studies with 8341 participants. Ketamine was given to 4588 participants and 3753 participants served as controls. Types of surgery included ear, nose or throat surgery, wisdom tooth extraction, thoracotomy, lumbar fusion surgery, microdiscectomy, hip joint replacement surgery, knee joint replacement surgery, anterior cruciate ligament repair, knee arthroscopy, mastectomy, haemorrhoidectomy, abdominal surgery, radical prostatectomy, thyroid surgery, elective caesarean section, and laparoscopic surgery. Racemic ketamine bolus doses were predominantly 0.25 mg to 1 mg, and infusions 2 to 5 µg/kg/minute; 10 studies used only S-ketamine and one only R-ketamine. Risk of bias was generally low or uncertain, except for study size; most had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm, resulting in high heterogeneity, as expected, for most analyses. We did not stratify the main analysis by type of surgery or any other factor, such as dose or timing of ketamine administration, and used a non-stratified analysis.Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced postoperative opioid consumption over 24 hours by 8 mg morphine equivalents (95% CI 6 to 9; 19% from 42 mg consumed by participants given placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 65 studies, 4004 participants). Over 48 hours, opioid consumption was 13 mg lower (95% CI 10 to 15; 19% from 67 mg with placebo, moderate-quality evidence; 37 studies, 2449 participants).Perioperative intravenous ketamine reduced pain at rest at 24 hours by 5/100 mm on a visual analogue scale (95% CI 4 to 7; 19% lower from 26/100 mm with placebo, high-quality evidence; 82 studies, 5004 participants), and at 48 hours by 5/100 mm (95% CI 3 to 7; 22% lower from 23/100 mm, high-quality evidence; 49 studies, 2962 participants). Pain during movement was reduced at 24 hours (6/100 mm, 14% lower from 42/100 mm, moderate-quality evidence; 29 studies, 1806 participants), and 48 hours (6/100 mm, 16% lower from 37 mm, low-quality evidence; 23 studies, 1353 participants).Results for primary outcomes were consistent when analysed by pain at rest or on movement, operation type, and timing of administration, or sensitivity to study size and pain intensity. No analysis by dose was possible. There was no difference when nitrous oxide was used. We downgraded the quality of the evidence once if numbers of participants were large but small-study effects were present, or twice if numbers were small and small-study effects likely but testing not possible.Ketamine increased the time for the first postoperative analgesic request by 54 minutes (95% CI 37 to 71 minutes), from a mean of 39 minutes with placebo (moderate-quality evidence; 31 studies, 1678 participants). Ketamine reduced the area of postoperative hyperalgesia by 7 cm² (95% CI -11.9 to -2.2), compared with placebo (very low-quality evidence; 7 studies 333 participants). We downgraded the quality of evidence because of small-study effects or because the number of participants was below 400.CNS adverse events occurred in 52 studies, while 53 studies reported of absence of CNS adverse events. Overall, 187/3614 (5%) participants receiving ketamine and 122/2924 (4%) receiving control treatment experienced an adverse event (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.4; high-quality evidence; 105 studies, 6538 participants). Ketamine reduced postoperative nausea and vomiting from 27% with placebo to 23% with ketamine (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.96; the number needed to treat to prevent one episode of postoperative nausea and vomiting with perioperative intravenous ketamine administration was 24 (95% CI 16 to 54; high-quality evidence; 95 studies, 5965 participants).\n    \n\n\n          Authors' conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and pain intensity. Results were consistent in different operation types or timing of ketamine administration, with larger and smaller studies, and by higher and lower pain intensity. CNS adverse events were little different with ketamine or control. Perioperative intravenous ketamine probably reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting by a small extent, of arguable clinical relevance."

Of the injuries treated, 24 occurred by a twisting mechanism, 10 were the result of contact, and 5 occurred from hyperextension. Thirty-five injuries occurred during sports activities, and 2 were sustained in motor vehicle accidents. The mean duration from injury to operative treatment was 101 days (range, 7 to 696 days). Injuries were classified as acute (n = 17) if surgery was performed within 6 weeks of injury and chronic (n = 22) if surgery was performed after 6 weeks from injury. Relationships between medial and lateral meniscal injuries and the time from injury to surgery were analyzed, and the 2 groups, acute and chronic, were compared.

            "abstract": "Specific knee kinematic alterations have been theorized to correlate with the progression of cartilage degeneration, and therefore, post-traumatic osteoarthritis in patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, how specific knee kinematic alterations contribute to knee joint cartilage degenerations remains to be unclear. To solve this problem, we hypothesized that there are specific cartilage-degenerating kinematic gait patterns that could be supported by the specific areas of cartilage lesions in ACLR knees. Thirty patients with unilateral ACLR knees and 30 healthy controls were recruited for the study. The kinematic differences between the ACLR knees and the healthy control knees during the stance phase were calculated to identify the kinematic patterns. Cartilage lesion distribution characteristics were acquired for patients with ACLR knees to validate the kinematic patterns using magnetic resonance images. Two kinematic patterns were modeled, i.e., sagittal (increased flexion angle and posterior tibial translation) and coronal (increased lateral tibial translation and abduction angle) kinematic patterns. For the sagittal pattern, the cartilage lesion distributions showed that there were more cartilage lesions (CLs) in the superoposterior regions than the posterior regions in the femoral condyles (p = 0.001), and more CLs in the posterior regions than the middle regions in the tibial plateau (p < 0.001). For the coronal pattern, the cartilage lesion distributions showed that there were more CLs in the lateral compartments near the tibial spine than the medial compartments near the tibial spine (tibial sides, p = 0.005 and femoral sides, p = 0.290). To conclude, the cartilage degeneration distribution evidence largely supports that the two kinematic patterns may contribute to cartilage degeneration in ACLR knees. These findings may provide a potential strategy of delaying early cartilage degeneration in ACLR knees by using motion (kinematic) pattern modification or training. However, investigations should be conducted on the actual effects of this potential strategy."

            "abstract": "In a retrospective study, 57 patients were examined following an intra-articular cruciate ligament reconstruction. The patients were divided into four groups according to the type of repair and the lapse of time between injury and operation. Twenty-five patients had undergone reconstruction with a semitendinosus tendon after acute instability (AST) and six, after chronic instability (CST). Eleven patients had received an acute reconstruction using the middle third of the patellar tendon (APT), as had 15 with chronic instability (CPT). The mean follow-up time was 48 months for the AST group, 60 months for the CST, 33 months for the APT, and 36 months for the CPT. In order to compare the groups, we used the Lysholm and OAK scores and the IKDC evaluation system. The only statistically significant difference found involved the IKDC evaluation system between the AST and CST groups. No significant decrease in activity level was noted in any of the groups. With the exception of the CST group, the preoperative Lachman test disappeared significantly at follow-up in all groups. The side-to-side difference of anterior tibial displacement measured with the KT 2000 at 25 degrees knee flexion and a load of 89 newtons was 1.32 mm for the APT group, 2.44 mm for the AST group, 2.47 mm for the CPT group, and 3.33 mm for the CST group. This side-to-side difference was not significant in the APT group. In the CPT group, arthrofibrosis was found in 27% of the patients, which led to reoperation. Reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament using the semitendinosus is no longer indicated for chronic instability. ACL-plasty with the middle third of the patellar tendon restored practically normal stability in acute ACL insufficiency."

            "abstract": "Besides patients having an acute rupture of the ACL with a clear therapeutical strategy there are increasingly young patients with chronical anterior instability and degenerative arthritis of the medial compartment and varus malalignment. This constellation is taxing severely the operative procedure considering that there is not only the instability which has to be treated but that also an improvement of the arthritis symptomatology has to be achieved. In this paper we present a therapeutical concept of high tibial osteotomy combined with an arthroscopic assisted reconstruction of the ACL which is performed as a single procedure since the early 80-ies. The goal is to remove two severe arthrogenic factors correcting the instability and the pathological anatomical axis, to reduce the medial knee pain and to improve the use of the knee in life activities."

            "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the mid-term results of surgical treatment in different groups of patients with multiple knee ligament injuries. Review of our patients' records revealed that 48 acute and chronic patients were surgically treated for combined knee injury. Due to severe capsular damage in these injuries, open techniques were used. In our treatment protocol, avulsed ligaments and tears of the posterolateral and posteromedial corner were repaired if possible, whereas midsubstance tears of cruciate ligaments and chronic cases were reconstructed with autografts. Postoperatively, an accelerated program of rehabilitation was introduced, aiming to progressively mobilize the joint and improve muscle endurance. For the follow-up evaluation we designed a protocol composed of two parts. In the first part, anatomical lesions were recorded and in the second part, clinical evaluation was performed using the Lysholm score, the Tegner rating system, the IKDC evaluation form, and the KT1000. Student's t tests and chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Forty-eight patients (mean age 28.6+/-11.9 years; 41 males) were classified according to the specific anatomical structures involved. Group A included 12 anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial structure injuries, group B included 11 ACL or posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) ruptures combined with posterolateral injuries, and group C consisted of 25 knee dislocations (ACL and PCL ruptures which might be combined with damage of the collateral ligaments). Thirty-eight patients were surgically treated during the acute phase and ten patients were treated chronically. Forty-four patients (91.6%) were followed up at a mean of 51.3+/-29.9 months. Average Lysholm score was 87+/-12.3; average Tegner score was 5.09+/-2.19 before accident and 4.34+/-2.12 in re-examination; IKDC score was A in 10 cases, B in 22, C in 6, and D in 6. The mean range of motion was 129.9 degrees +/-12.5 degrees . The average loss of extension and flexion were 1.6 degrees +/-2.5 degrees and 7.6 degrees +/-7.9 degrees , respectively. The side-to-side difference in corrected anterior and posterior translation in quadriceps neutral angle and in anterior translation in 30 degrees angle was <3 mm for about 65% of our patients. Surgical treatment of multiple knee ligament injuries, using autografts, provided satisfactory stability, range of motion, and subjective functional results. However, despite the improvement of the quality of life, the preinjury patients' activity level was not fully obtained in re-examination. Patients underwent surgical treatment during the acute phase had better scores in several points, but finally there was no statistical significance between acute and chronic patients. Moreover, no statistically significant differences were observed among the groups with specific damaged anatomical structures."

            "abstract": "It is hypothesized that the mechanism, or mechanisms, responsible for donor-specific transfusion (DST)/cyclosporine (CsA) immunosuppression is generated by an active immune response that is most dynamic in the immediate peritransplant period and thus might be at the peak of vulnerability to the influences of added immunosuppression. To better define this concept, four immunosuppressive drugs were combined with a d-1 DST and 14-day course of CsA in the ACl-to-Lewis cardiac transplant model. A 5-day course of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) initiated at d-1 or d+4 with DST/CsA reduced survival vs. DST/CsA alone (27.0 +/- 2.6 days and 24.6 +/- 5.7 days vs. 95.3 +/- 16.3 days, P<.05). Delay of initiation to d+7 improved survival to 39.5 +/- 8.9 days. A 5-day course of methylprednisolone (MP) begun at d-1 with DST/CsA decreased survival vs. DST/CsA alone, 59.2 +/- l0.0 days vs. 95.3 +/- 16.3 days, but delay to d+4 improved survival to 110 +/- l8 days, P<.05 vs d-1. A 3-day course of brequinar (Breq) begun at d-1 with DST/CsA increased survival to 244 +/- 48.6 days, while delay to d+4 reduced survival to 49.0 +/- 6.7 days, P<.05 vs. d-1. Finally, a 5-day course of rapamycin (Rapa), was given with d-1 DST/CsA treatment beginning on d-1, d0, d+l, d+3, d+5, and d+7. In this instance, no significant differences in survival were found between timing groups or DST/CsA control. Together, these data support the hypothesis that DST/CsA treatment generates an active immune response that is inhibited by early initiation of ATG or MP, enhanced by early administration of Breq, and unchanged by early administration of Rapa."

Pathological findings included an absent anterior cruciate (14 knees), severe stretching (13), failed reconstruction or repair (4), midportion tears (3), and avulsion (1). Postoperative patients were evaluated according to the Kennedy criteria. An anterior drawer of 2+ was not observed in any patient. There were no cases of 2+ rotary instability, and no pivot shifts. The possibility of a dynamic or proprioceptive repair was assessed by electromyography. While no evidence of electrical activity was recorded on the gluteus maximus on 60 normal knee examinations, all 10 tested postoperative iliotibial band patients had electrical activity. The failed results of the series showed no evidence of activity."

            "abstract": "With the heightened popularity of childhood sporting activity, the number of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures has increased. Management of these injuries presents a particular challenge due to the open femoral and tibial growth plates. Physeal damage has the potential to cause angular deformity or length discrepancy. This review was conducted to determine the best way to treat this injury. A primary search of Ovid MEDLINE (1 October 2017) used the terms: (ACL or anterior cruciate ligament) and (young or child or children or pediatric or immature or pre-pubescent). Titles/Abstracts of 369 articles were screened for relevance. A total of 217 were excluded, leaving 152 articles for full-paper retrieval. Of these, 9 articles remained with one further article identified during cross-referencing; 10 papers (1 level 2 and 9 level 3) were included for analysis. Comparative studies investigating surgical (140 knees) versus conservative (110 knees) treatment provide evidence in favour of the former, in reducing instability and meniscal tears and improving return to previous activity. Of the papers analysed (163 reconstructions), there was only one case of growth arrest (0.6%) and no cases of length discrepancy. In those studies investigating early (218 patients) versus delayed (140 patients) reconstruction, medial meniscal tears and chondral injuries occurred more frequently in the delayed group. To conclude, for children, there is level 2/3 evidence that early operative ACL reconstruction offers the best chance of a return to pre-injury sporting activity and minimises the risks of further structural damage. Iatrogenic growth disturbance remains a rare but worrying complication."

The purpose was to assess incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome factors. Six postoperative intraarticular infections were detected. Average followup was 3 years (range, 2-8 years). The rate of infection was 0.14%. Five men and one woman with a median age of 32.5 years (range, 20-51 years) comprised the study group. The average interval from the onset of symptoms to the initial arthroscopic intervention was 7.5 days (range, 2-20 days). Staphylococcus aureus was present in three knees, Staphylococcus epidermidis in two, and Streptococcus nonhemolytic in one. All patients had initial arthroscopic debridement and lavage followed by 6 weeks of intravenous antibiotics. Two grafts were removed: one patient had delayed ligament reconstruction and the other had total knee arthroplasty. The remaining patients had full range of motion. In the group with the best result, two patients had Staphylococcus epidermidis and one had Staphylococcus aureus, which was treated 2 days after clinical symptoms began. The other two patients infected with Staphylococcus aureus had unsatisfactory results. Anterior cruciate ligament infection is rare, but diagnosable. When treated early with appropriate antibiotic therapy and arthroscopic debridement, four of six grafts were retained. If the infection does not respond rapidly to early therapy, then graft removal is an option."

            "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the success of the all-inside repair technique for medial bucket-handle meniscus tear (BHMT) and the factors affecting healing. A total of 36 patients with BHMT who were operated between 2012 and 2018 and completed final follow-up examinations were included in the study. Functional evaluation was made with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. Healing was evaluated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slices. The patients were evaluated with respect to the effect on healing of factors such as demographic data, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, anterior cruciate ligament tear reconstruction (ACLTR) applied at the same time as BHMT repair, and the tear being chronic or acute. The mean age of the patients was 28.6 ± 8.6 years (range,18-46 years), the mean follow-up period was 25.8 ± 13.9 months (range, 13-59 months), and BMI was mean 25.6 ± 3.5 kg/m2 (range, 20.1-30.5 kg/m2). The meniscus tears were acute in 16 (44.4%) patients and chronic in 20 (55.6%). ACLTR was applied together with BHMT repair in 25 patients. The hybrid technique, as the outside-in technique in addition to the all-inside technique, was applied to 12 (33.3%) patients, where there was seen to be extension to the anterior horn. The failure rate was determined as 27.8% according to the postoperative MRI evaluation and the Barrett criteria. No positive or negative statistically significant effect on healing was determined of chronic BHMT or of simultaneous application of ACLTR (p = 1.00 and 0.457, respectively). Cigarette smoking and high BMI were determined to have a statistically significant negative effect on healing (p = 0.026 and 0.007, respectively). In conclusion, it can be seen that the success of the all-inside technique for BHMT remains controversial. Due to the features of the application, it can be used in meniscus tears of the posterior horn only. In the current study, with the success rate of 72.2% of the all-inside technique in meniscus body tears, it was seen that a high success rate could not be achieved."

There was no association found between the initial onset of the abnormal displacements in the 21 knees and either the amount of time after surgery or the rehabilitation program. Six of the seven grafts that failed did so in the 1st postoperative year. Serial displacement measurements allow early detection of graft stretching and subsequent modification of rehabilitation or delay in return to strenuous activities.

Matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and collagen Ⅱ are important components of ECM. Earlier we found that quercitrin could significantly decrease MMP13 gene expression and increase collagen Ⅱ gene expression in IL-1β-induced rat chondrocytes and human chondrosarcoma (SW1353) cells. Objectives: The effects and mechanism of quercitrin on OA were explored. Methods: Molecular mechanisms of quercitrin on OA were studied in vitro in primary chondrocytes and SW1353 cells. An anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) rat model of OA was used to investigate the effect of quercitrin in vivo. Micro-CT analysis and Safranin O-Fast Green Staining of knee joint samples were performed to observe the damage degree of tibial subchondral bone. Immunohistochemistry of knee joint samples were conducted to observe the protein level of MMP13, collagen Ⅱ and p110α in articular cartilage. Results: In vitro, quercitrin promoted cell proliferation and delayed ECM degradation by regulating MMP13 and collagen II gene and protein expressions. Moreover, quercitrin activated the Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p110α (p110α)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by targeting p110α. We also firstly showed that the gene expression level of p110α was remarkably decreased in cartilage of OA patients. The results showed that intra-articular injection of quercitrin increased bone volume/tissue volume of tibial subchondral bone and cartilage thickness and reduced the Osteoarthritis Research Society International scores in OA rats. Meanwhile, immunohistochemical results showed that quercitrin exerted anti-OA effect by delaying ECM degradation. Conclusion: These findings suggested that quercitrin may be a prospective disease-modifying OA drug for prevention and treatment of early stage OA."

Using additive manufacturing (AM) technology, we developed a titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) interference screw with chemically calcium phosphate surface modification technology to improve bone integration in the tibial tunnel. After chemical and heat treatment, the titanium screw formed a dense apatite layer on the metal surface in simulated body fluid. Twenty-seven New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into control and additive manufactured (AMD) screw groups. The long digital extensor tendon was detached and translated into a tibial plateau tunnel (diameter: 2.0 mm) and transfixed with an interference screw while the paw was in dorsiflexion. Biomechanical analyses, histological analyses, and an imaging study were performed at 1, 3, and 6 months.

The green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene was inserted the PRG4 gene to facilitate tracing the distribution of the transgene product (AAV-PRG4-GFP) in vivo. Transduction efficiency of AAV-PRG4-GFP was evaluated in joint cells, and the conditioned medium containing secreted PRG4-GFP was used for shear loading/friction and viability tests. In vivo transduction of joint tissues following intra-articular injection of AAV-PRG4-GFP was confirmed in the mouse stifle joint in a surgical model of destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM), and chondroprotective activity was tested in a rabbit anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) model. In vitro studies showed that PRG4-GFP has lubricin-like cartilage-binding and antifriction properties. Significant cytoprotective effects were seen when cartilage was soaked in PRG4-GFP before cyclic shear loading (n = 3). Polymerase chain reaction and confocal microscopy confirmed the presence of PRG4-GFP DNA and protein, respectively, in a mouse DMM (n = 3 per group). In the rabbit ACLT model, AAV-PRG4-GFP gene therapy enhanced lubricin expression (p = 0.001 vs. AAV-GFP: n = 7-14) and protected the cartilage from degeneration (p = 0.014 vs. AAV-GFP: n = 9-10) when treatments were administered immediately postoperation, but efficacy was lost when treatment was delayed for 2 weeks.

During a period of 22 months, we performed clinical and radiological assessments on 20 patients (6 acute and 14 chronic) with isolated posterior instability caused by posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture and on 20 patients with normal knees. The radiological examination included stress radiographs using the Telos device (Telos, Griesheim, Germany) as well as a modification of the routine axial patellofemoral view. Both diagnosis and quantification of the posterior tibial translation was possible in all cases by measuring, on the axial view, the distance between the anterior edge of the tibial plateau and the center of the femoral groove (trochlea). Clinical examination, conventional radiography, KT-1000 arthrometry, stress radiography at 90 degrees and at 20 degrees of flexion, and magnetic resonance imaging all assist in diagnosing a PCL tear. This new radiographic technique is simple, fast, and consistently effective both in patients with acute and those with chronic PCL tears, as well as in those who have undergone PCL reconstruction."

            "abstract": "To characterize veterinary surgeons' preferences in diagnostic, surgical, and postoperative management of cranial cruciate ligament ruptures in dogs, 175 surgeons, including American College of Veterinary Surgeons diplomates, surgery specialty-practice veterinarians, university surgeons, and surgery residents, were surveyed. Their experience with stifle surgery was evenly distributed from 1 to > 21 years. Approximately 70% (118/175) of surgeons treated 3 to 9 dogs with cranial cruciate ligament rupture each month. In diagnosis, 98% (172/175) of the surgeons used a cranial drawer test with the stifle joint at 140 degrees of flexion. Stifle radiography was performed by 53% (93/175) of surgeons for acute and by 81% (141/175) of surgeons for chronic cases. In repair of cranial cruciate ligament ruptures, 32% (56/175) of surgeons did not use intra-articular procedures, whereas 8% (14/175) of surgeons did not use extra-articular procedures. Surgical preferences depended on dog size (P < 0.05). For small dogs (ie, < 11 kg), 80% (140/175) of surgeons used extra-articular methods, and 14% (24/175) used intra-articular methods. For medium dogs (ie, 11 to 29 kg), 52% (91/175) of surgeons used extra-articular and 43% (75/175) used intra-articular methods. For large dogs (ie, > 29 kg), surgeons' preferences depended on the injury's duration (P < 0.05). For large dogs with acute injuries, 39% (68/175) preferred extra-articular and 55% (96/175) preferred intra-articular, whereas in chronic cases, 52% (91/175) preferred extra-articular and 42% (73/175) preferred intra-articular. The most common extra-articular method was placement of a suture from the lateral fabella to a hole drilled in the tibial tuberosity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It has been used to assess functional outcome for many medical conditions, both acute and chronic. The use of this survey in evaluating the effects of treatment of any specific disease or injury allows comparison of treatments across a broad spectrum of disease categories. The purpose of this study was to see if this assessment tool could 1) be used to identify those patients requiring anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, 2) detect changes in the patients with treatment over time, and 3) correlate with the commonly used knee assessment scales. The short-form health survey could not identify those patients requiring anterior cruciate ligament reconstructive surgery. However, it did show important and significant changes with treatment (surgical and nonsurgical) over time. There was a significant correlation between the short-form health survey and the Lysholm and International Knee Documentation Committee scores during this study. The addition of the MOS 36-item short-form health survey to our traditional knee ligament evaluation tools is encouraged. Its use will permit the orthopaedic community to demonstrate the value of our treatment of anterior cruciate ligament injuries to health care planners and generalist physicians."

At 6 months postoperatively, the LSI of IKE was measured at 60°/s, which was used as the main outcome. A correlation analysis was performed with the LSI of IKE at 6 months postoperatively as the dependent variable and the LSI of IKE at 3 months postoperatively as the independent variable.

Average correction angle of the osteotomy was 7 degrees (4-10 degrees) with a mean malalignment of 5 degrees (0-10 degrees).

Members of the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) were surveyed to determine their current ACL reconstruction technique and opinions regarding preoperative and postoperative management. In 1999, members of the AOSSM were mailed surveys asking about their current treatment of ACL injuries. Approximately 76% of the active members responded to the survey, of which a large percentage (92%) currently performs ACL reconstructions. Both the experience of the surgeon and annual number of ACL reconstructions performed were recorded. Most responding surgeons routinely perform ACL reconstructions 3-6 weeks following an acute ACL injury using an endoscopic technique. Bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) with interference screw fixation was the technique of choice for most respondents, with the majority performed on an outpatient basis. Rehabilitation protocols showed more variation regarding postoperative weight bearing, immobilization and bracing, length of physical therapy, and return to sport. Most surgeons prefer early postoperative full weight bearing with an average of 3.8 weeks of postoperative bracing. Physical therapy typically ranged from 1-4 months with return to sport at 6-7 months, generally with a functional brace. Patients with BPTB reconstruction were allowed the earliest return to full activity. Although previous clinical and biomechanical studies show good-excellent results with different ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation techniques, currently most surgeons practicing as members of the AOSSM continue to prefer BPTB grafts with metal interference screw fixation.

The purpose of this study is to report the consensus statements on operative vs. non-operative treatment of ACL injuries developed at the ACL Consensus Meeting Panther Symposium 2019. Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, were convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organizing Committee and Session Chairs for the three working groups. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided the initial agreement and comments on the statement via an online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty percent agreement was defined a-priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative v. non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached the consensus during the Symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support, two reached strong consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting, and pivoting sports, early anatomic ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomic ACL reconstruction is indicated. The consensus statements derived from international leaders in the field will assist clinicians in deciding between operative and non-operative treatments with patients after an ACL injury.Level of evidence V."

The standard criteria for evaluation of the International Knee Documentation Committee, the Lysholm knee score and measurements using the KT 1000 arthrometer all showed satisfactory results. Deterioration in the clinical performance after seven years was associated with osteoarthritic changes and correlated with chronic ligament injuries and meniscectomy. There were three traumatic and three spontaneous ruptures. We believe that the procedure can be successful, but remain concerned about failure of the graft and osteoarthritis.

Patients requiring extra sequences, missed by the radiography technicians, were recalled. The MRI sequences were evaluated in a blinded fashion by three radiologists, and compared to the knee arthroscopy findings, with the normal ACL acting as internal controls. The radiography technicians performed additional ACL sequences in 63 patients (27%); of these, 10 patients had a partial and 12 patients had a complete ACL tear. Only 2 patients (0.6%) were recalled (one with a normal, and one with a full thickness ACL tear).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The filmed ACL evaluation for complete tears and a normal ACL had a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 97.1% and accuracy of 97.3%, slightly higher than evaluating on the monitor. Volume sequences had specificities and accuracies over 95%, with good intraobserver reliability (Kappa 0.859, 95% CI 0.705-1.0). Experienced radiographers identified most cases requiring supplementary MRI ACL sequences. An additional volume sequence was beneficial when filmed. Use of the monitor can offer some benefits. Limited oblique T1 sequence of the intercondylar notch was unreliable."

These effects on postoperative pain perception have never been investigated in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which reflects biochemical alterations in the brain. Therefore, we investigated the associations among cigarette smoking, postoperative pain, and levels of beta-endorphin and substance P in human CSF. Methods: We recruited 160 Chinese men (80 active smokers and 80 nonsmokers) who underwent lumbar puncture before anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, and 5-ml CSF samples were collected. Pain visual analog scale (VAS) scores, post-anesthetic recovery duration (PARD), and smoking variables were obtained. CSF levels of beta-endorphin and substance P were measured. Results: Compared to non-smokers, active smokers had significantly higher pain VAS (2.40 ± 0.67 vs. 1.70 ± 0.86, p < 0.001) and PARD scores (9.13 ± 2.11 vs. 7.27 ± 1.35, p = 0.001), lower CSF beta-endorphin (33.76 ± 1.77 vs. 35.66 ± 2.20, p = 0.001) and higher CSF substance P (2,124.46 ± 217.34 vs. 1,817.65 ± 302.14, p < 0.001) levels. Pain VAS scores correlated with PARD in active smokers (r = 0.443, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Cigarette smoking is associated with increased postoperative pain intensity, shown by delayed pain perception, higher pain VAS scores, and lower beta-endorphin and higher substance P levels in the CSF of active smokers.

To date, there has been no systematic review of the economic literature on anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).\n    \n\n\n          Purpose:\n        \n      \n      To evaluate the overall evidence base for economic studies published on ACLR in the orthopaedic literature. Data available on the economics of ACLR are summarized and cost drivers associated with the procedure are identified.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Systematic review.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      All economic studies (including US-based and non-US-based) published between inception of the MEDLINE database and October 3, 2014, were identified. Given the heterogeneity of the existing evidence base, a qualitative, descriptive approach was used to assess the collective results from the economic studies on ACLR. When applicable, comparisons were made for the following cost-related variables associated with the procedure for economic implications: outpatient versus inpatient surgery (or outpatient vs overnight hospital stay vs >1-night stay); bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) graft versus hamstring (HS) graft source; autograft versus allograft source; staged unilateral ACLR versus bilateral ACLR in a single setting; single- versus double-bundle technique; ACLR versus nonoperative treatment; and other unique comparisons reported in single studies, including computer-assisted navigation surgery (CANS) versus traditional surgery, early versus delayed ACLR, single- versus double-incision technique, and finally the costs of ACLR without comparison of variables.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A total of 24 studies were identified and included; of these, 17 included studies were cost identification studies. The remaining 7 studies were cost utility analyses that used economic models to investigate the effect of variables such as the cost of allograft tissue, fixation devices, and physical therapy, the percentage and timing of revision surgery, and the cost of revision surgery. Of the 24 studies, there were 3 studies with level 1 evidence, 8 with level 2 evidence, 6 with level 3 evidence, and 7 with level 4 evidence. The following economic comparisons were demonstrated: (1) ACLR is more cost-effective than nonoperative treatment with rehabilitation only (per 3 cost utility analyses); (2) autograft use had lower total costs than allograft use, with operating room supply costs and allograft costs most significant (per 5 cost identification studies and 1 cost utility analysis); (3) results on hamstring versus BPTB graft source are conflicting (per 2 cost identification studies); (4) there is significant cost reduction with an outpatient versus inpatient setting (per 5 studies using cost identification analyses); (5) bilateral ACLR is more cost efficient than 2 unilateral ACLRs in separate settings (per 2 cost identification studies); (6) there are lower costs with similarly successful outcomes between single- and double-bundle technique (per 3 cost identification studies and 2 cost utility analyses).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      Results from this review suggest that early single-bundle, single (endoscopic)-incision outpatient ACLR using either BPTB or HS autograft provides the most value. In the setting of bilateral ACL rupture, single-setting bilateral ACLR is more cost-effective than staged unilateral ACLR. Procedures using CANS technology do not yet yield results that are superior to the results of a standard surgical procedure, and CANS has substantially greater costs."

Previous failures in PCL reconstruction and early reports raising potential biomechanical and clinical advantages have spurred interest in this technique. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the minimum 2-year results of PCL reconstruction using a single-bundle bone-patellar tendon-bone graft and tibial inlay fixation.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      The authors prospectively studied 44 patients having isolated or combined PCL reconstruction using the direct tibial inlay fixation technique. The study period was from 1991 to 2001. Two-year minimum follow-up was 93% (41/44) and averaged 39.4 months. These 41 patients comprised the study group. Thirty-one patients were male and 10 patients were female; average age was 28 years. There were 35 primary and 6 revision reconstructions. Surgery was performed in the acute or subacute setting (<8 weeks) in 34% (14/41) and chronic setting in 66% (27/41). Combined reconstructions involving the posterolateral corner, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), or medial collateral ligament (MCL) were done in 85% (35/41). In all patients, preoperative posterior drawer (PD) examination demonstrated greater than 12 mm posterior translation. All PCL reconstructions were performed with bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, which was 12 to 18 mm in width (16 autograft; 25 allograft). Wider tendon grafts were prepared from the allografts and tubularized to fit through an 11-mm tunnel. All patients were evaluated with preoperative and postoperative examination and x-rays. Final follow-up International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective evaluation, final follow-up IKDC objective evaluation, and final follow-up Telos stress radiography were performed in all patients.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Postoperative PD examination demonstrated the following: 0 (normal) in 9 patients, 1+ in 25 patients, 2+ in 7 patients, and none >2+, as compared to preoperative PD 3+ or greater in all patients in this report. No patient had <12 mm PD preoperatively. Mean improvement in PD was >2 grades of translation as compared to preoperative exam. Forty of forty-one demonstrated a solid endpoint on clinical PD testing. Final follow-up Telos stress radiography with 25 kg posterior load applied at 80 degrees to 90 degrees of flexion demonstrated average side-to-side difference of 4.11 mm (-2 to 10 mm). Average flexion loss was 4 degrees (0-15 degrees ). None lost extension. Preoperative IKDC objective evaluation rated all knees as severely abnormal based on instability. Final follow-up objective IKDC evaluation distribution was as follows: A, 4 knees; B, 24 knees; C, 11 knees; and D, 2 knees, as compared to all 41 D preoperatively. Average final follow-up IKDC subjective score was 75.1 (20-100). When assessing final follow-up stability with Telos stress radiography, primary cases were significantly more stable than revision cases (P <.05). There was no difference in stability when comparing allograft versus autograft, but improved IKDC scores were seen with allograft (P <.05). There was a trend for combined reconstructions to be more stable than isolated reconstructions. All patients evaluated their knee as improved or greatly improved and would repeat the procedure.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Reconstruction of the PCL-deficient knee with severe posterior laxity is a challenging surgical problem, as combined instability patterns frequently coexist (85% in this study). When appropriate combined reconstructions or primary repair is used, PCL reconstruction with autologous or allograft bone-patellar tendon-bone graft using tibial inlay fixation was shown to be a successful technique at 2- to 10-year follow-up. Based on their initial experience with this technique and previous experience with open and arthroscopic techniques using a transtibial tunnel, the authors continue to use the tibial inlay technique as their preferred technique for isolated or combined reconstruction of the PCL."

The left knee anterior cruciate ligaments of all mini pigs were transected. The mini pigs were divided into 3 groups postoperatively, with 5 pigs randomly assigned to 1 group. Dual-flip angle-based fast T1 mapping for dGEMRIC was obtained in the sagittal planes at 0 week (group 1), 3 weeks (group 2), and 6 weeks (group 3) after operation, using an 8-channel knee coil. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 3T with dual-flip angle-based fast 3D T1 mapping sequence for morphological cartilage assessment of dGEMRIC T1 values. After MRI analysis, histological and biochemical composition (water, collagen, and glycosaminoglycan [GAG]) of the knee cartilage in the medial femoral condyle was quantified ex vivo.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The T1 values obtained by the dual-flip angle-based fast 3D T1 mapping were positively correlated with the glycosaminoglycan content (r = 0.85; P < 0.05). The values had no significant correlation with the collagen content. The dGEMRIC-T1 values obtained by this method showed the medial femoral condyle cartilage in the anterior cruciate ligament-transected knee after transection decreased with time (P < 0.05). Histological sections of cartilage damage were correlated with MRI data.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      This study demonstrated the reliability of using dual-flip angle-based fast T1 mapping for dGEMRIC for the biochemical assessment of early cartilage degeneration.

            "abstract": "Anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the pediatric and adolescent population are becoming more common with the trends of increased participation in competitive athletics in younger children. The natural history of this injury is similar to that of the adult and results in frequent reinjury, instability, and debilitation. Delayed reconstruction has proven to be a clinically effective treatment method but requires a prolonged restriction of competitive athletics. Reconstruction in the acute and subacute period has been shown by many authors to be a successful, reproducible treatment regimen. Nonetheless, the unique pitfalls of ACL reconstruction in a skeletally immature patient must not be overlooked. A thorough preoperative evaluation for leg-length discrepancy or subtle angular deformity is essential to identify the presence of an entity that might otherwise be attributed to surgical complication. For the patient nearing skeletal maturity with little growth remaining, we recommend the standard tunnel positioning and the use of soft-tissue graft. For younger patients who have significant growth remaining, alternative physeal \"safe\" procedures should be considered. No prospective, randomized studies compare the clinical success of graft type, graft placement, or graft fixation in this age group. Further follow-up of existing study groups and prospective research is warranted to fine-tune the result-based decision making for treatment of this injury."

The study included 156 patients with 156 knee injuries (72 acute and 84 chronic) who were seen during 1 year at Martin Army Hospital at Fort Benning Georgia. All patients were given a primary diagnosis based on their history, physical examination, and routine radiographs. Fifty-seven patients were also given one or more secondary diagnoses. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and arthrograms were not used in the evaluation of these patients. The primary diagnosis was correct in 83% of the knees. Of 57 secondary diagnoses given, 54% were correct and 31% were incomplete. An incorrect diagnosis was made in 14% of knees for both primary and secondary diagnoses. There were four patients with no identifiable lesion other than synovitis. With the increasing cost of medical care, the need for expensive diagnostic studies such as magnetic resonance imaging needs to be evaluated. The cost of a magnetic resonance image scan ranges between $600 to $1200 depending on the institution. The use of magnetic resonance imaging as a routine diagnostic aid in the clinical examination of the knee is unnecessary. Arthroscopic surgery of the knee should be based on the patient's history, physical examination, and radiographs."

One included study used MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score to evaluate PFJ degenerative changes. The overall prevalence of PFJ OA after ACL injury in included studies varied between 4.5% and 80%. The large variation of PFJ OA prevalence is mainly because of different follow-up period and surgical techniques. The pooled data showed that bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, single-bundle ACL reconstruction (ACLR), and delayed ACLR are likely associated with PFJ degenerative changes after ACL injury. ACLR, delayed ACLR, body mass index (BMI), meniscectomy, patellofemoral chondral lesions, age at surgery, and TFJ OA were identified in the literature inducing PFJ OA after ACL injury.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Large variations of PFJ OA after ACL injury are associated with different follow-up period and surgical techniques.

The first series was derived from a review of 150 cases of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with a follow-up of 3 years or more. Arthrosis was seen to have developed in 13.3%. The second series was concerned with 64 cases of unilateral arthrosis treated by upper tibial valgus osteotomy in whom there had been a previous rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. The \"tolerance time\"--that is the time between the original ligamentous injury and the time of osteotomy--for the development of arthrosis was very variable, ranging in cases with a \"natural history\" from 10 to 50 years with a mean of 35 years. It is important to recognise the radiological signs of the onset of arthrosis. These are osteophytosis of the intercondylar notch, osteophyte formation at the posterior part of the medial tibial plateau, and, in particular, narrowing of the medial joint line with posterior subluxation of the medial femoral condyle, well seen in lateral radiographs whilst standing on one lower limb. Early arthroses, appearing after 10 years, may occur as a \"natural arthrosis\", but it develops much more frequently after surgical treatment that had failed to correct anterior laxity and particularly when it had been performed on knees that were already pre-arthrotic. The main factor in arthrosis is anterior laxity measured radiologically by an \"active Lachman\" radiograph. Removal of the medial meniscus, which, in itself, is liable to produce arthrosis is even more harmful in anterior cruciate laxity since it doubles the degree of anterior subluxation of the tibia seen on unilateral weight-bearing. The development of varus deformity, which characterises progressive arthrosis, has its origin in wear of the posterior part of the medial tibial plateau caused by anterior cruciate laxity. Other factors play an important part such as associated lateral laxity, constitutional genu varum and weakness of the hamstring muscles which oppose the subluxating action of the quadriceps."

In this study we functionally evaluate Achilles tendon allografts processed with a previously developed radioprotective treatment based on (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide) crosslinking and free radical scavenging using ascorbate and riboflavin, for ovine anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction was performed using double looped allografts, while comparing radioprotected irradiated and fresh frozen allografts after 12 and 24 weeks post-implantation, and to control irradiated grafts after 12 weeks. Radioprotection was successful at preserving early subfailure mechanical properties comparable to fresh frozen allografts. Twelve week graft stiffness and anterior-tibial (A-T) translation for radioprotected and fresh frozen allografts were comparable at 30 % of native stiffness, and 4.6 and 5 times native A-T translation, respectively. Fresh frozen allograft possessed the greatest 24 week peak load at 840 N and stiffness at 177 N/mm. Histological evidence suggested a delay in tendon to bone healing for radioprotected allografts, which was reflected in mechanical properties. There was no evidence that radioprotective treatment inhibited intra-articular graft healing. This specific radioprotective method cannot be recommended for ACL reconstruction allografts, and data suggest that future efforts to improve allograft sterilization procedures should focus on modifying or eliminating the pre-crosslinking procedure."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common injury. The healing potential of the injured ACL is poorly understood and is considered limited. Therefore, most ACL tears that are treated surgically undergo reconstruction rather than repair. However, there has been renewed interest recently in repairing ACL tears despite unanswered questions regarding the healing capacity of the ACL.\n    \n\n\n          Hypothesis:\n        \n      \n      Gene expression in the injured ACL varies with time from injury.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Descriptive laboratory study.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Transcriptome-wide expression profiles of 24 human ACL remnants recovered at the time of surgical reconstruction were analyzed using the Agilent human 8x60K microarray platform. Gene ontology was performed on differentially expressed transcripts based on time from injury (acute, <3 months; intermediate, 3-12 months; chronic, >12 months). A subset of transcripts with large fold changes in expression between any 2 categories was validated via microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Numerous transcripts representing important biological processes were differentially expressed by time from injury. The most significant changes were noted between the acute and chronic groups. Expression of several extracellular matrix genes- namely, POSTN, COL5A1, COL1A1, and COL12A1-was lower in the chronic tears compared with acute and intermediate tears. In acute tears, processes representing angiogenesis and stem cell differentiation were affected. In intermediate tears, processes representing stem cell proliferation concomitant with cellular component organization/cellular localization were altered. In ACL tears more than 12 months out from injury, processes denoting myosin filament organization, cellular component organization/cell localization, and extracellular matrix organization were affected.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      These findings are consistent with initial repair activity in the injured ACL, which declines with time from injury. Individual genes identified in this study, such as periostin, deserve further investigation into their role in tissue repair.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      The decreased healing capacity of ACL tears over time is relevant to the development of effective techniques for repairing ACL tears and may have some significance for ACL reconstruction techniques as well. The potential for healing appears to be greatest in acute ACL tears, suggesting this window should be the focus of research for ACL repair."

Special investigations of 13 with acute complete ligament repair, followed from 12 months to 48 months (average of 24 months), showed loss of joint motion following this injury. Clinical instability was generally not a problem, but chronic pain and discomfort were present in 46%. The average knee diagnostic score was 43. Seventy-seven percent of the patients returned to vigorous sports activities. Early operative repair followed by cast bracing and manipulation at three months (if flexion was less than 90 degrees) is recommended in young, active patients."

In order to determine whether the structure of the intercondylar notch predisposes a knee to anterior cruciate tears, a computer graphics study was designed. Notch view roentgenograms of 50 patients with an acute ACL injury and 50 \"normal\" patients without history of significant knee injury were compared. An interactive graphics design station was used to obtain the area of the anterior opening (ANT) and posterior arch (POST) of the intercondylar notch. A \"total\" (TOTAL) area was obtained by tracing the distal 7.5 cm of the femur. Only the ratios of areas obtained from each roentgenogram were used for comparison because of varying femur sizes among patients and possible slightly varying techniques of taking the notch view roentgenogram itself. The following ratios were developed: ANT/POST, POST/TOTAL, and (POST-ANT)/TOTAL. The difference between the means of the ratio POST/TOTAL for knees with acute ACL tears and those for normal knees was statistically significant (P less than 0.005). This study suggests that a narrowed posterior arch of the intercondylar notch may predispose a knee to ACL tear."

            "abstract": "One of the most common injuries of the knee joint is a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Most authors believe that early rehabilitation of patients after ACL reconstruction promotes better treatment outcomes. Less is known about the influence of the time that passes from injury to surgical reconstruction. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the dependence of treatment outcomes of ACL on injury-to-reconstruction and reconstruction-to-rehabilitation time lags. The study included 30 patients of the mean age 34 ± 7 years with trauma-related rupture of ACL and its surgical reconstruction. The time range from ligament rupture to its reconstruction was 120-180 days and from reconstruction to rehabilitation was 1-120 days. Postsurgical rehabilitation outcomes were assessed with the Lysholm knee scale and the IKDC 2000 subjective knee evaluation form. The scales were applied before and after rehabilitation. We found distinct improvements in all physical symptoms in the damaged knee joint, regardless of the time elapsed from trauma to ACL reconstruction and from ACL reconstruction to rehabilitation. The beneficial outcomes of rehabilitation were significantly inversely associated with the time elapsing from reconstruction to rehabilitation commencement but failed to depend on the time from ACL rupture to reconstruction. We conclude that rehabilitation should start as early as possible after ACL reconstruction to optimize the beneficial outcomes in terms of functional physical recovery, whereas the injury-to-reconstruction delay is less meaningful to this end."

Standard x-ray's and stress views are very useful imaging modalities but magnetic resonance imaging remains the gold standard imaging study for detecting ligament injuries. Every knee scope should be preceded by an examination under anesthesia.

Acute surgery in patients with combined ligament injuries of the knee can lead to stiffness, primarily with medial-side injuries. Knee dislocations with lateral-side injuries require acute repair to achieve a good long-term result. All knee dislocations should not be grouped together because of the difference in healing potential between medial- and lateral-side injuries. Patients likely prefer a knee that is mildly lax but functional with full range of motion as opposed to a stiff, painful, stable knee. Treatment is based on the individual healing potential of the injured structures and the natural history of these injuries, along with the following principles: (1) medial-side injuries can heal with proper nonsurgical treatment; (2) posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tears with grade II laxity or less can heal with similar long-term results as PCL tears with grade I laxity; therefore, surgery may not be indicated. As surgical techniques are developed and improved upon, a more aggressive approach to PCL reconstruction may be warranted; (3) PCL laxity greater than grade II and a soft end point should be considered for semiacute reconstruction; and (4) anterior cruciate ligament injuries in combination with medial collateral ligament and/or PCL injury can initially be treated nonsurgically and reconstructed later as dictated by patient symptoms and activity level."

            "abstract": "Five of 97 cruciate ligament prostheses (5.15 per cent) implanted for an average of 3 years (8-53 months) in 70 patients with acute chronic cruciate ligament instability were removed due to failure after a mean of 9 (3-15) months. Investigation of the explanted polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-grafts by scanning electron and light microscopy showed not bony but fibrous tissue ingrowth in all parts of the prostheses. The extent of local host response in the interface region differed with the intensity of mechanical strain at the three parts of the prostheses (intra-articular, bone tunnel, cortical). Inflammatory cells and foreign body giant cells were abundant close to the rupture sites at the intra-articular entries of the bone tunnels and scarce at the intra-articular part of the prostheses and at the cortical anchoring. Evaluation of the reasons for early prostheses failure indicates that (1) non-ideal placement of bone tunnels and (2) inadequate strain were responsible for reoccurring instability and rupture after prosthetic cruciate ligament replacement."

The diagnosis of LMRA was made arthroscopically. The effects of gender, activity, grade of laxity, time from injury, and concomitant meniscal lesions were analyzed.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Among 532 patients, 497 (93.4%) underwent primary ACL reconstruction and 35 (6.5%) underwent revision procedures. 383 were acute or subacute injuries (less than 6 months from injury to surgery) and 149 chronic (more than 6 months). Average age was 30.4 years (DS: ± 11.04); there were 422 (79.3%) males and 110 (20.6%) females. A LMRA associated with the ACL injury was detected in 72 cases (13.5%), with a significant prevalence observed in males ([Formula: see text] = 4.65; P = 0.031, statistically significant). In the 149 patients with a chronic injury, 27 patients had LMRA (18.1%), while 45 of the 383 patients with an acute or subacute injury had LMRA (11.7%). There was a tendency, albeit not significant ([Formula: see text] = 3.721; P = 0.054), for the prevalence to increase with time since the initial ACL injury.

At follow-up (mean 45 months) the results were assessed with the Cincinnati Knee Rating System. There were no significant differences between the two groups for symptoms, functional limitations, sports activity levels, or the overall rating score. The ligament augmentation device provided no benefit. In both groups, the allograft and the allograft composite restored posterior stability at lower functional knee flexion angles, but not uniformly at higher flexion angles (70 degrees). Patients with acute ruptures faired significantly better than did those with chronic ruptures because they had lower anterior-posterior displacements and fewer symptoms and functional limitations. We recommend consideration of early arthroscopic posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction for acute ruptures in active patients. An immediate knee motion program was not deleterious to graft fixation and is recommended."

The purpose of this study was to determine how controlled axial loading after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction affects tendon-to-bone healing. Our hypothesis was that controlled cyclic axial loading after a period of immobilization would improve tendon-to-bone healing compared with that associated with immediate axial loading or prolonged immobilization.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      One hundred and fifty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction with use of a flexor digitorum longus autograft. A custom-designed fixture was used to apply an external fixator across the knee parallel to the anterior cruciate ligament graft. Animals were randomly assigned to be treated with immobilization (n = 36) or controlled knee distraction along the long axis of the graft to achieve approximately 2% axial strain beginning (1) immediately postoperatively (n = 36), (2) on postoperative day 4 (\"early delayed loading,\" n = 42), or (3) on postoperative day 10 (\"late delayed loading,\" n = 42). The animals were killed at fourteen or twenty-eight days postoperatively for biomechanical testing, micro-computed tomography, and histomorphometric analysis of the bone-tendon-bone complex. Data were analyzed with use of a two-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc Tukey test with p < 0.05 defined as significant.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Delayed initiation of cyclic axial loading on postoperative day 10 resulted in a load to failure of the femur-anterior cruciate ligament-tibia complex at two weeks that was significantly greater than that resulting from immediate loading or prolonged immobilization of the knee (mean and standard deviation, 9.6 ± 3.3 N versus 4.4 ± 2.3 N and 4.4 ± 1.5 N, respectively; p < 0.01).

            "abstract": "Medial collateral ligament (MCL) injuries are the most common ligamentous injury of the knee. The extent of injury can range from a minor first-degree (1-degree) sprain to an extensive third-degree (3-degree) sprain that can propagate across the knee, rupturing one or both cruciate ligaments, and result in a knee subluxation or dislocation. A common pattern involves the combined anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and MCL injury that is the focus of this chapter. The vast majority of these combined medial-sided injuries are treated nonoperatively with delayed reconstruction of the ACL injury in athletically active individuals. The MCL and associated medial structures are carefully assessed on physical examination, and classification of injury is based upon abnormal limits of joint motion. In vitro cadaveric biomechanical testing has given us a better understanding of ligament deficiency and altered joint motion. Consistency in terminology is necessary for proper classification of injury and reproducible categorization of injury patterns to be able to compare both nonoperative and operative treatment of various injury patterns."

Patients were examined under anesthesia before surgery, using the PS test. During arthroscopy, intra-articular soft-tissue damage of the injured knee was classified as: (1) partial ACL tear; (2) complete isolated ACL tear; (3) complete ACL tear with one meniscus tear; and (4) complete ACL and bimeniscal tears. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to evaluate whether sex, age, body mass index, sport at injury, mechanism of injury, time from injury and intra-articular damage (structural damage of ACL and menisci) were associated with a grade III PS. Intra-articular damage was further analyzed for two sub-cohorts: acute (time from injury ≤ 6 months) and chronic injuries (> 6 months).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      A grade III PS test was observed in 26% of patients. A significant association with PS grading was shown for age, time from injury and intra-articular soft-tissue damage (p < 0.05). Further analyses showed that grade III PS was associated with intra-articular damage in chronic injuries only (p < 0.01). In complete ACL and bimeniscal tears, grade III PS was more frequent in chronic (53%) than in acute knee injuries (26%; p < 0.01). Patients with chronic complete ACL and bimeniscal tears had a grade III PS 3.3 [1.3-8.2] times more often than patients in the acute sub-cohort.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In ACL-injured patients, a preoperative grade III PS was mainly associated with a higher amount of intra-articular soft-tissue damage and chronicity of the injury.

            "abstract": "Tears of the medial collateral ligament (MCL) are the most common knee ligament injury.Incomplete tears (grade I, II) and isolated tears (grade III) of the MCL without valgus instability can be treated without surgery, with early functional rehabilitation.Failure of non-surgical treatment can result in debilitating, persistent medial instability, secondary dysfunction of the anterior cruciate ligament, weakness, and osteoarthritis.Reconstruction or repair of the MCL is a relatively uncommon procedure, as non-surgical treatment is often successful at returning patients to their prior level of function.Acute repair is indicated in isolated grade III tears with severe valgus alignment, MCL entrapment over pes anserinus, or intra-articular or bony avulsion. The indication for primary repair is based on the resulting quality of the native ligament and the time since the injury. Primary repair of the MCL is usually performed within 7 to 10 days after the injury.Augmentation repair for the superficial MCL (sMCL) is a surgical technique that can be used when the resulting quality of the native ligament makes primary repair impossible.Reconstruction is indicated when MCL injuries fail to heal in neutral or varus alignment. Reconstruction might be advisable to correct chronic instability. Chronic, medial-sided knee injuries with valgus misalignment should be treated with a two-stage approach. A distal femoral osteotomy should be performed first, followed by reconstruction of the medial knee structures. Cite this article: EFORT Open Rev 2018;3:398-407. DOI: 10.1302/2058-5241.3.170035."

            "abstract": "We carried out a prospective study of 71 patients who had undergone reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the ABC scaffold. Their mean age was 28 years (18 to 50). All had either sub-acute or chronic traumatic deficiency of the ligament. The mean period of follow-up was five years (four to seven). Assessment included the use of the International Knee Documentation Committee score, the modified Lysholm score, the Tegner Activity score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome score and measurement with the KT-1000 arthrometer. Two patients had mild recurrent synovitis. There were no infections and no failures of the ligament. During the period of study, two patients sustained a traumatic fracture of a femoral condyle. The implants retained their integrity in both cases. All patients returned to their previous or enhanced levels of daily activity by three months after operation and 56 (79%) achieved their pre-injury level of sporting activity by six months. The patients who were competing in National level sports returned to play at one level less after operation than before. The Lysholm score showed that 58% of the patients (41) were excellent, 34% (24) good, and 8% (6) fair, with a mean post-operative score of 93. According to the International Knee Documentation Committee score, 35% of knees (25) were 'normal', 52% (37) 'nearly normal' and 13% (9) 'abnormal'. Complete satisfaction was noted in 90% of patients (64). The development of osteoarthritis and the management of anterior cruciate deficiency associated with laxity of the medial collateral ligament remains uncertain. Our results indicate that in the medium-term, the ABC ligament scaffold is suitable and effective when early and safe return to unrestricted activities is demanded. We acknowledge the current general hostility towards reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with artificial materials following reports of early failure and chronic synovitis associatiated with the production of particulate debris. We did not encounter these problems."

This highlights the importance of considering the effects of delaying surgery when managing patients with such deficiency."

Anterior cruciate ligament tears in children and adolescents: a meta-analysis of nonoperative versus operative treatment. Am J Sports Med. 2014;42(11):2769-2776. Clinical Questions: In pediatric patients, does early operative treatment of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury result in decreased knee instability compared with delayed or nonoperative treatment?\n    \n\n\n          Data sources:\n        \n      \n      This review focused on the PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The following query searches were used: ACL or anterior cruciate ligament and young or child or children or pediatric or immature. Dates searched were not specified. A separate search was also conducted of abstracts published between 2009 and 2011 from the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons; American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine; International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery, and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine; European Society of Sports Traumatology, Knee Surgery, and Arthroscopy; American Orthopaedic Association; Arthroscopy Association of North America; Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America; and American Academy of Pediatrics conferences.\n    \n\n\n          Study selection:\n        \n      \n      Available studies were included only if they were written in English; were of level 1, 2, or 3 evidence (grading taxonomy not stated); were cohort designs that compared nonoperative and operative treatments; involved an early versus delayed ACL reconstruction that could be prospective or retrospective; and reported primary outcome interest measures. Animal studies, basic science studies, case series, reviews, commentaries, and editorials were excluded from the review.\n    \n\n\n          Data extraction:\n        \n      \n      A systematic assessment tool, Guide to Community Preventive Services: Systematic Reviews and Evidence-Based Recommendations, was used by 2 of the authors to independently grade the quality of each study that met the inclusion criteria. The tool focused on 6 areas: intervention and study description, sampling, measurement, analysis, interpretation of results, and other execution factors. This tool helped to ensure consistency, reduce bias, and improve the validity and reliability of preventive health care studies. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Six studies compared nonoperative with operative treatment, and 5 studies compared early reconstruction (open physes) with delayed reconstruction (closed physes). Studies in this meta-analysis consisted of the following: four level-3 prospective studies, four level-3 retrospective studies, one level-2 retrospective study, one level-3 case-control study, and one level-3 study with both prospective and retrospective data collection. All of the studies included data related to patient demographics, treatment interventions, follow-up duration, presence of any meniscal symptoms, time to return to sport participation, patient-reported outcomes (International Knee Documentation Committee [IKDC], Lysholm, or Tegner scores), the need for a second surgical procedure, and any posttreatment problems.\n    \n\n\n          Main results:\n        \n      \n      Of those who chose the nonoperative route, 75% reported instability, whereas only 13.6% of those who had surgery reported instability. These data also showed that nonoperative or delayed-operative patients were 33.7 times more likely to report instability than the early operative group. Those who chose the nonoperative route had a 12 times greater risk (odds ratio = 12.2, 95% confidence interval = 1.55, 96.3) of developing a meniscal tear after the initial injury. Three studies included in the meta-analysis reported return to sport status, but only 2 studies provided adequate data for both operative and nonoperative patients. In 1 study, 92% of operative patients were able to return to sport, but only 43.75% of nonoperative patients were able to do so. The second study reported that all operative and nonoperative patients were able to return to the same level of sport after injury. Of those in the early operative group, 6% required a repeat surgical intervention for either an ACL rerupture or a meniscal tear, and 19% of those who initially chose nonoperative treatment eventually needed surgery to repair the ACL or meniscus. Findings favor the early operative group over the delayed operative and nonoperative groups based on IKDC scores. One study reported a significant difference in operative patients, with an IKDC mean score of 95 compared with 87 in the nonoperative group. Similarly, a different study reported a mean score of 94.6 in the early operative group compared with 82.4 in the delayed operative group and was stated to have met the minimal clinically important difference (MCID). The MCID was not met for the Lysholm and Tegner scores between operative and nonoperative patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      The results of this meta-analysis favor early operative treatment for pediatric patients with ACL tears over delayed or nonoperative treatment. Early operative treatment is initiated shortly after the injury, while the patient is still skeletally immature and the growth plates are open. Current evidence suggests that early ACL reconstruction will result in less knee instability and a more likely return to the preinjury activity level without affecting the growth plates or causing growth disturbances."

Age, sex, time interval from injury, preoperative motion, and concomitant meniscal repair or partial meniscectomy were evaluated for their significance as risk factors. Twenty-two of 188 patients (12%) developed arthrofibrosis; the incidence was lower when the acute anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction was delayed at least 3 weeks from the injury, and when preoperative extension was 10 degrees or better. Age, sex, preoperative flexion, and need for concomitant meniscal surgery were not risk factors. The postoperative motion protocol evolved during the study period. Group 1 patients were braced in 45 degrees of flexion for 1 week before passive extension was allowed. In Group 2, motion was started after 48 hours. Group 3 patients were braced in full extension, with motion starting with 24 hours. With these changes, the incidence dropped from 23% to 3%.

The three testing parameters were the extent of anterior translation at eighty-nine newtons of force and at maximum manual force, and the compliance index. The differences between the involved and the uninvolved knees were calculated. At eighty-nine newtons, all but one of the control subjects had anterior translation of ten millimeters or less, compared with 58 per cent of the patients who had a chronic tear. At maximum manual force, all but two of the control subjects had translation of ten millimeters or less, compared with 20 per cent of the patients who had an acute or a chronic tear. Analysis of variance showed that the clinical diagnosis correlated well with the results for all tests (p less than 0.001). However, when the uninjured knees of patients who had an acute or a chronic tear were compared with the knees of the control subjects, significant differences were noted (p less than 0.001 to 0.006). In the patients who had a chronic tear, there was no relationship between the time from injury to operation and the extent of anterior translation. The arthrometric test at maximum manual force was the strongest discriminant; it differentiated normal from abnormal knees (p less than 0.001) with high sensitivity (92 per cent), high specificity (95 per cent), and high positive predictive accuracy; the cut-off point was eleven millimeters or less.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In the period of January to November 1984 in 81 patients anterior cruciate ligament replacement was performed. A retrospective 2-years follow-up in 72 patients and a second 5-years follow-up in 67 of those 72 patients was possible. There were 38 patients with an acute rupture and 34 patients with chronic instability. Clinical and instrumented laxity revealed a mean displacement difference of not more than 3 mm in 84% of the patients in comparison of the involved with the normal knee at the 2-years and 5-years follow-up. 80% of strength analyses showed a physiological balance of quadriceps and hamstrings in the 5-years follow-up. In the 2-years follow-up only 41% of patients practiced former sports activities again, whereas in the 5-years follow-up 80% of the patients were able to join former sports. 80 to 100 points of Lysholm score demonstrating good to very good results were reached in 91% of the patients. Especially cartilage damages in cases of chronic instabilities worsened the results mentioned by the patients."

Early onset osteoarthritis (OA) can be a devastating and difficult to manage consequence of such an injury. The techniques for reconstructing the ACL are advancing all the time, but the effect that this has on the progression of OA is less well understood. Many factors affect the development of OA following an ACL injury, including direct and indirect trauma to the articular cartilage, associated meniscal injuries, chronic tibiofemoral joint instability, and multiple enzymatic pathways.

            "abstract": "The incidence of meniscal tear was reported to increase with the delay of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). The tear may occur concurrently with the ACL injury or after the ACL injury. Few studies had focused on the patients whose meniscus is intact during ACL injury. We determined the correlation between timing of surgery and incidence of meniscal tears in ACL-deficient knees with initially intact meniscus. We retrospectively reviewed 387 patients who had undergone primary ACLR. Time of initial ACL injury, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination, and surgery was recorded. The MRI was reviewed by experienced radiologic and orthopaedic doctors. Intraoperative arthroscopic images were also obtained and reviewed. The type of tear noted during surgery was classified according to the modification of International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine classification of meniscal tears. Patients were divided into early (surgery within 12 months from injury) and late surgery group (surgery at more than 12 months from injury). There were 216 patients with intact medial meniscus and 257 patients with intact lateral meniscus on the postinjury MRI study. The incidence of medial meniscus tear (MMT) was significantly higher than lateral meniscus tear (LMT) during the ACLR (33.8 vs. 19.8%, p < 0.001). The incidence of MMT is higher in late group than in early group (53.7 vs. 29.1%, p = 0.004, odds ratio= 2.815). The incidence of LMT is mildly higher in late group but without statistics significance (23.8 vs. 18.6%, p = 0.364). In both MMT and LMT, the most common injury pattern observed was a longitudinal tear. The incidence of each type is not different between early and late group. For patients without concurrent meniscal injuries with the ACL tear, the incidence of MMT significantly increased if ACLR was performed more than 12 months after injury. The medial meniscus was more prone to injury than the lateral meniscus in chronic ACL-deficient knee. ACLR should be performed earlier to reduce the risk of meniscal tears for patients without initially concurrent meniscal tear."

This time was significantly different from those with no meniscal damage at diagnosis, but who were found subsequently to have sustained damage to one meniscus, when the median time was 11 months (P = 0.0017) or both menisci, when the median time was 32 months (P = 0.0184). For patients with solitary ACL rupture undergoing a trial of conservative management, an early and thorough assessment of functional stability is essential. If the instability is unacceptable, the patient should be informed of the time dependent risk to the menisci with further delay to surgical reconstruction."

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term isokinetic muscle performance after ACL surgery and to analyze by a multiple stepwise regression which factors (if any) predict the overall outcome. The study subjects were 119 patients who had a complete rupture of the ACL and had been treated surgically at the Tampere University Hospital between 1981 and 1990. They were divided into the acute group (N = 62) and into the chronic group (N = 57) according to the time delay between the injury and the ACL surgery. The isokinetic strength measurements of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were performed on average 4 years after the operation using Cybex II and Cybex 6000 dynamometers (Lumex Inc., Ronkokoma, NY, USA). The peak torques were determined at speeds of 60 and 180 degrees/s and the peak work at speed of 180 degrees/s. The measurements revealed that after the ACL surgery there was still a considerable thigh muscle strength deficit especially in extension of the injured extremity, the average extension strength deficit ranging from 9 to 20%. The extension strength deficit was significantly more prominent in the chronic (18-20%) than in the acute group (9-15%). The extension strength deficit was significantly greater ar the slower (15-20%) than higher (9-18%) speed of the isokinetic movement. In both the acute and chronic groups, a multiple stepwise regression analysis indicated that patellofemoral pain and flexion deficit of the knee were the factors that most frequently and significantly associated with the strength deficits. At the higher speed of the isokinetic movement, these two factors accounted 20% and 21% for the variation seen in the quadriceps strength deficit of the acute group and the chronic group. No correlation could be found between age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, length of the follow-up time, injury type, athletic activity level, immobilization method, knee stability, and the isokinetic muscular performance."

Selection criteria were randomized and quasirandomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared platelet-rich therapy with either placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling, or no platelet-rich therapy for people with acute or chronic musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Primary outcomes were functional status, pain, and adverse effects. The investigators found 19 studies that compared platelet-rich therapy with placebo, autologous whole blood, dry needling, or no platelet-rich therapy. Disorders included rotator cuff tears (arthroscopic repair; 6 trials); shoulder impingement syndrome surgery (1 trial); elbow epicondylitis (3 trials); anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (4 trials), ACL reconstruction (donor graft site application; 2 trials), patellar tendinopathy (1 trial), Achilles tendinopathy (1 trial), and acute Achilles rupture surgical repair (1 trial). They further subdivided the studies based on type of treatment, including tendinopathies in which platelet-rich therapy injections were the main treatment (5 trials), and surgical augmentation procedures in which platelet-rich therapy was applied during surgery (14 trials). The conclusion was that there is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of platelet-rich therapy for treating musculoskeletal soft tissue injuries. Researchers contemplating RCTs should consider the coverage of currently ongoing trials when assessing the need for future RCTs on specific conditions. There is a need for standardization of PRP preparation methods. At this time, the use of PRP in foot and ankle surgery as an orthobiologic does not have an absolute indication. Many of the studies are lower evidence-based from surgical techniques. Several in vitro studies have shown that growth factors promote the regeneration of bone, cartilage, and tendons. More clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of PRP as an orthobiologic. In the author’s opinion, PRP does have a role when conservative treatment has failed and the next treatment option is an invasive surgical procedure"

The same postoperative rehabilitation protocol was used for all patients and follow-up at a median of 31 months (24 to 59) was carried out by independent observers. Four patients (2%) were lost to follow-up. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the Stryker laxity test, one-leg hop test, Tegner activity level, Lysholm score, patellofemoral pain score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score or visual analogue scale, reflecting patient satisfaction and knee function. Slightly decreased extension, compared with the non-operated side, was found in the patellar tendon group (p < 0.05). Patients with associated meniscal injuries had lower IKDC, visual analogue (p < 0.01) and Lysholm scores (p < 0.05) than those without such injuries. Patients in whom reconstruction had been carried out less than five months after the injury had better final IKDC scores than the more chronic cases (p < 0.05). We conclude that patellar tendon and quadruple semitendinous tendon grafts have similar outcomes in the medium term. Associated meniscal pathology significantly affects the final outcome and early reconstruction seems to be beneficial."

The Lateral-Anterior Drawer test (LAD-test) is a suggested alternative that previously demonstrated concurrent validity in situ. Further in vivo LAD-test clinical accuracy examination is required prior to any recommendation for clinical adoption. Thus, this case-control study aims to (1) investigate the LAD-test's in vivo interrater and intra-rater reliability; (2) establish LAD-test concurrent validity against MRI as the reference standard; and (3) examine the correspondence between examiners' professional working experience and LAD-test diagnostic accuracy.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Three examiners with different professional experience levels, blindfolded during testing, and blinded from subjects' identity, medical history, and reference test outcome performed all LAD-testing twice per subject. Reliability analyses included percent agreement, Fleiss' kappa and Cohen's kappa coefficients with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) calculations. Validation parameters included sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios (LR + ; LR-), and predictive values (PPV; NPV) each accompanied by 95%CIs; each tester's percent agreement with the MRI; and their Youden Index.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      The study sample was comprised of 31 subjects of which 14 had a history of unilateral full-thickness PCL-rupture.

However, in the acutely managed patient, early mobility is associated with better outcomes in comparison with immobilization. Acute surgery is highly associated with range-of-motion deficits. Staged procedures may produce better subjective outcomes and a lower number of range-of-motion deficits but are still likely to require additional treatment for joint stiffness. More aggressive rehabilitation may prevent this from occurring in multiple-ligament knee injuries that are treated acutely."

The study was conducted on 25 anterior cruciate ligament deficient subjects prior to and 6 weeks, 4 months, 8 months and 12 months following ACL reconstructive surgery using the bone-patellar tendon-bone technique. Gait analysis was performed by applying the zebris three-dimensional ultrasound-based system with surface electromyograph (zebris). Kinematic data were recorded for the lower limb. The muscles surveyed include vastus lateralis and medialis, biceps femoris and adductor longus. The results obtained from the injured subjects were compared with those of 51 individuals without any ACL damage whatsoever. Acute ACL deficient patients exhibited a quadriceps avoidance pattern prior to and 6 weeks following surgery. No quadriceps avoidance phenomenon develops in chronic ACL deficient patients. In operated individuals, tempo-spatial parameters and the knee angle regained a normal pattern for the ACL-deficient limb during gait as early as 4 months following surgery. However, the relative ACL movement parameter, which describes the tibial translation into the direction of ACL, and the EMG traces show no significant statistical difference compared with the same values of the healthy control group just 8 months following surgery. The analysis of spatial-temporal parameters and EMG traces show that the development of a quadriceps avoidance pattern is less common than previously reported. These data suggest that anterior cruciate ligament deficiency and reconstruction produce considerable changes in the lower extremity gait pattern. The results suggest that gait parameters tend to shift towards a normal value pattern; and the re-establishment of pre-injury gait patterns-including the normal biphase of muscles-takes at least 8 months to occur."

The commonest tear was the single longitudinal vertical split of the medial meniscus. There was an increasing incidence of meniscal tears as the injury became more chronic, with a significant (P < 0.001) increase in medial meniscal tears; the incidence of lateral meniscal tears remained relatively constant. Seventy-five (43%) of the patients had one or both menisci repaired. Acutely, repair was performed more frequently on the medial meniscus than the lateral (80% versus 24%, respectively). All repaired menisci had single longitudinal tears unstable to probing. The incidence of repair dropped to 46% in the medial meniscus and 14% in the lateral meniscus in the chronic stage. Nineteen (25%) of these 75 patients (26 menisci) underwent a check arthroscopy at a minimum of 6 months from repair. All 21 medial menisci and all 5 lateral meniscal tears had healed; however, 1 lateral meniscus had torn along the line of the sutures. At an average followup of 40 months, 92% of the repaired menisci were still in situ and 8% that had required resection were related to the recurrence of anterior cruciate ligament instability.

Three orthopedic surgeons completed a questionnaire immediately after the initial evaluation of a patient with a knee injury and for whom an MRI also was ordered by that surgeon. The questionnaire asked the surgeons' what their proposed clinical diagnoses and treatment plans would be if MRI was not available. Eighty-five patients were included in the study. Initial treatment recommendation was altered for 18 patients (21%) solely because of the MRI results. The physicians and MRI were most accurate for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears followed by medial meniscus tears, and lateral meniscus tears, and significantly behind in accuracy for patellofemoral chondral pathology. These diagnoses were more frequently missed in the face of acute ACL pathology for the clinician and MRI. In 19 cases in which the surgeon was confident of ACL insufficiency, in only 1 (5%) case did the MRI scan provide useful information. In 19 cases in which an ACL reconstruction was performed, the decision to proceed with the reconstruction was hastened in 3 patients because of the MRI results. These results indicate that the use of MRI for decision making in acute ACL tears is not of much benefit unless the diagnosis of ACL insufficiency is in question. Magnetic resonance imaging is more useful for the decision-making process when the pathology involves the menisci or chondral surfaces. In this study, MRI of the knee beneficially altered the treatment plan of the orthopedist in 18% of the patients and resulted in the prolongation of symptoms in 4% of patients."

The aim of this article is to highlight the differences in philosophies and outcomes of historical lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) and contemporary, anterolateral reconstruction.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      A narrative review was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE using the keywords \"lateral extra-articular tenodesis\" and \"anterolateral ligament reconstruction\".\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Results of search strategy: Thirty-seven studies [13 reporting clinical outcomes of isolated LET in ACL deficient knees and 24 comparing isolated anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with ACLR + LET] and 1 study on anterolateral ligament (ALL) reconstruction were identified as relevant and included in the review. Results of literature review: Isolated extra-articular reconstructions are rarely performed in contemporary practice. They are associated with a high rate of persistent anterior instability and early degenerative change. Combined ACL reconstruction and lateral extra-articular tenodeses results in a significant reduction in the prevalence of residual pivot shift, but the majority of the studies do not demonstrate any significant difference with respect to patient-reported outcome measures and return to sport. Although several authors report a trend towards decreased graft rupture rates, significant differences were not demonstrated in most studies. In a single clinical study, combined anatomic ACL and anterolateral ligament reconstruction was reported to be associated with a threefold reduction in graft rupture rates and improved return to sport compared to isolated ACL graft choices.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Historically performed, combined ACL reconstruction and lateral extra-articular tenodeses are associated with improved knee kinematics. Although trends towards decreased graft rupture rates are reported by several authors, the majority did not demonstrate a significant difference, likely as a result of small and underpowered studies using post-operative immobilisation and delayed rehabilitation protocols. More recently, combined ACLR and ALL reconstruction has been shown to be associated with significant improvements in graft failure and return to sport rates when compared to isolated ACLR. However, these results are from a single clinical series with only medium-term follow-up.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      IV."

            "abstract": "The anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are crucial stabilizers of the knee. These ligaments are named by the location of their tibial attachments. Each ligament is composed of separate functional bundles that differ in size but are equally important in function. MR imaging is accurate and sensitive, making it the imaging technique of choice for evaluating these ligaments. Acute and chronic injuries involving the cruciate ligaments have typical appearances and associated findings. MR imaging interpretation must take into account atypical injuries and imaging pitfalls. Knowledge of normal ligament reconstruction techniques allows differentiation of the normal postoperative appearance from reconstruction failure and complications. Ligament reconstruction techniques, complications, and appearances are reviewed in this article."

The purpose of this study was to describe our method of surgical treatment of knee dislocations with use of a standardized protocol and to report the clinical results.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Forty-seven consecutive patients presented with an occult (reduced) or grossly dislocated knee. Fourteen of these patients were not included in this series because of confounding variables: four had an open knee dislocation, five had vascular injury requiring repair, three were treated with external fixation, and two had associated injury. The remaining thirty-three patients underwent surgical treatment for the knee dislocation with our standard approach. Anatomical repair and/or replacement was performed with fresh-frozen allograft tissue. Thirty-one of the thirty-three patients returned for subjective and objective evaluation with use of four different knee-rating scales at a minimum of twenty-four months after the operation.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Nineteen of the thirty-one patients were treated acutely (less than three weeks after the injury) and twelve, chronically. The mean Lysholm score was 91 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 80 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. The Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living scores averaged 91 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 84 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. The Knee Outcome Survey Sports Activity scores averaged 89 points for the acutely reconstructed knees and 69 points for the chronically reconstructed knees. According to the Meyers ratings, twenty-three patients had an excellent or good score and eight had a fair or poor score. Sixteen of the nineteen acutely reconstructed knees and seven of the twelve chronically reconstructed knees were given an excellent or good Meyers score. The average loss of extension was 1 degrees , and the average loss of flexion was 12 degrees . There was no difference in the range of motion between the acutely and chronically treated patients. Four acutely reconstructed knees required manipulation because of loss of flexion. Laxity tests demonstrated consistently improved stability in all patients, with more predictable results in the acutely treated patients.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Surgical treatment of the knee dislocations in our series provided satisfactory subjective and objective outcomes at two to six years postoperatively. The patients who were treated acutely had higher subjective scores and better objective restoration of knee stability than did patients treated three weeks or more after the injury. Nearly all patients were able to perform daily activities with few problems. However, the ability of patients to return to high-demand sports and strenuous manual labor was less predictable."

The LGDT tests and the measurements of external tibial rotational angle (ETRA) were first performed on all the intact knees and then at each time point when an additional structure was sectioned. Results of each LGDT test and the absolute value of increased ETRA compared with the intact knee were recorded. Each knee was tested at 30° of flexion. A navigation system was used to measure motion changes of the tibia with respect to the femur.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Initially, the LGDT tests all showed negative on each of the intact knee.

However, simultaneous sectioning of the distal POP-T and PFL produced significantly increased ETRA with the LGDT tests changed to positive. In addition, for the knee with medial structural injuries, the LGDT test could also be positive only when the posteromedial structures (sMCL, deep MCL, POL) and the cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL) were all sectioned.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      In this cadaveric sequential sectioning study, the LGDT test showed positive merely at the following two situations: (1) the distal POP-T and PFL were both sectioned; (2) the posteromedial structures (sMCL, deep MCL and POL) and the cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL) were all sectioned.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      Accuracy of the LGDT test in diagnosing acute or chronic posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries will improve with the information in this study.

            "abstract": "One hundred and twenty-seven patients who had a rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament agreed to participate in a prospective, randomized study of three arthroscopically assisted reconstruction techniques. One hundred and twenty-five patients (125 reconstructions) were evaluated after a mean duration of follow-up of forty-two months (range, two to five years). Group I included forty patients who had a two-incision reconstruction with use of an autogenous semitendinosus-gracilis graft, group II consisted of forty patients who had a two-incision reconstruction with use of an autogenous patellar-ligament graft, and group III included forty-five patients who had a single-incision reconstruction (endoscopic technique) with use of an autogenous patellar-ligament graft. The male-female ratio, age range, level of athletic activity, interval between the injury and the reconstruction, previous operative procedures, and associated injuries were similar in all three groups. The same postoperative rehabilitation protocol was followed for all patients. Testing with a KT-2000 arthrometer at maximum manual force was done at the follow-up evaluation; the difference in laxity between the involved knee and the contralateral knee was three millimeters or less in thirty-three patients (83 per cent) in group I, thirty-seven patients (93 per cent) in group II, and thirty-nine patients (87 per cent) in group III. A difference of two millimeters or less was found in thirty patients (75 per cent) in group I, thirty-one patients (78 per cent) in group II, and thirty-five patients (78 per cent) in group III. Thirty-five patients (88 per cent) in group I, thirty-eight patients (95 per cent) in group II, and forty patients (89 per cent) in group III returned to at least the same level of athletic activity. Four grafts (two in group I and two in group II) failed as a result of trauma. There was one additional failure in groups I and III, as evidenced by a difference of nine and seven millimeters, respectively, on instrumented testing of laxity. The significant findings were that no knee was rated D according to the system of the International Knee Documentation Committee (p < 0.002, 94 per cent confidence level) and that fewer additional operative procedures were done on patients in group III (p < 0.08). Also, it was found that the patients in group II returned to a greater level of athletic activity (p < 0.02) and that a higher percentage of the patients in this group had a difference of three millimeters or less on testing with the KT-2000 arthrometer than in the other two groups (p < 0.08). However, with the numbers available, there were no significant differences in the over-all outcome among the three groups (p > 0.1). Importantly, the rate of failure was not greater and the outcomes were not less satisfactory for the late reconstructions than they were for the acute reconstructions (those performed less than three weeks after the injury), including those done with an autogenous semitendinosus-gracilis graft in a chronically unstable knee."

The objective was to identify commonly treated conditions for which there was a substantial body of literature from which to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of NMES. Included studies had to apply NMES with visible and tetanic muscle contractions. Method: Four electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, PUBMED, and SCOPUS) were searched for relevant literature published between database inceptions until May 2015. Additional articles were identified from bibliographies of the systematic reviews and from personal collections. Results: The extracted data were synthesized using a consensus process among the authors to provide recommendations for optimal stimulation parameters and application techniques to address muscle impairments associated with the following conditions: stroke (upper or lower extremity; both acute and chronic), anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, patellofemoral pain syndrome, knee osteoarthritis, and total knee arthroplasty as well as critical illness and advanced disease states. Summaries of key details from each study incorporated into the review were also developed. The final sections of the article outline the recommended terminology for describing practice using electrical currents and provide tips for safe and effective clinical practice using NMES. Conclusion: This article provides physiotherapists with a resource to enable evidence-informed, effective use of NMES for PT practice."

            "abstract": "Rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament of the knee is a common injury occurring mostly in young athletic individuals taking part in pivoting, cutting and jumping sports. It is demonstrated by anterolateral rotatory instability on clinical testing. As yet there are no clear guidelines as to whom will benefit from surgical reconstruction as opposed to rehabilitation alone, apart from elite athletes (defined as varsity players or those participating in sport at national or international level). Also, some adolescent knees and those with combined injuries, usually meniscal tears, may benefit from surgery. Even after surgery there is an increased incidence of rerupture and the development of degenerative changes in the operated knee, particularly in the young athlete who has returned to a high level of sporting activity. Early diagnosis is essential to provide a focused care pathway and to avoid the consequences of chronic cruciate insufficiency. Currently, it seems that too many anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions may be undertaken where rehabilitation alone would have sufficed. Better preoperative clinical testing including improved arthrometric assessment, muscle and neurological testing and imaging including radiology and MRI may help refine the diagnosis, thus enabling a better decision on further management. There is also a requirement for better designed clinical studies reporting on the outcomes of treatment be it either surgical or conservative."

Two cases of symptomatic deep-venous thrombosis occurred in the early group. The mean range of movement was significantly greater at two weeks in the delayed group. Quadriceps muscle power was significantly better in the delayed group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05). These trends were evident at later time points, but were not statistically significant. One patient in each group had clinically significant knee stiffness at 52 weeks. IKDC scores and Tegner activity levels were not significantly different at 52 weeks.

            "abstract": "Bone adapts to altered physical stimuli, dietary changes, or injury. Dietary calcium and vitamins play important roles in maintaining skeletal health, but high-fat diets are pervasive in western cultures and may contribute to the increasing prevalence of osteoporosis and incidence of related hip fractures. Exercise helps maintain bone mass and counter osteoporosis, but exercise can also have detrimental effects-particularly for immature bone. Some negative exercise effects may also be linked to diet. For example, insufficient dietary protein during exercise can impair bone development and remodeling. Bone remodeling is a potent example of tissue repair. Chronically altered loading after a joint injury, however, can result in remodeling processes that can be detrimental to the joint. Anterior cruciate ligament injury, for example, commonly leads to osteoarthritis. Early changes in the periarticular cancellous bone may play a role in the development of knee osteoarthritis. Although these factors influence skeletal health, the mechanisms remain unclear by which bone interprets its environment and responds to mechanical stimuli or injury. To understand why different levels of exercise are beneficial or detrimental or why altered joint loading leads to changes in periarticular bone structure, underlying mechanisms must be understood by which bone interprets its mechanical environment."

We included literature published after 1980, focusing on burn outcomes in children aged 5 to 18 years. Each eligible study was systematically reviewed and primary outcomes were classified into outcome domains based on existing frameworks. Fifty-eight studies met inclusion criteria, and reported on physical (n = 24), psychological (n = 47), and social (n = 29) domains. The majority of the studies had sample sizes of <100 participants, burn size of <40%, and findings reported by parents and/or burn survivors. Only eight of 107 different measures were used in three or more studies. Parents and burn survivors generally reported better physical and social outcomes and worse psychological functioning compared to non-burn populations. Physical disabilities were associated with psychological and social functioning in several studies. Follow-up data reported improvements across domains. This review demonstrates the importance of physical, psychological, and social status as long-term outcomes in burn survivors. Mixed findings across three outcome domains warrant long-term research.

In 6 patients a suture-bridge technique via a mini-open approach was performed due to a small or comminuted fracture fragment. In 2 patients an all-arthroscopic technique was performed. No complications. The all-arthroscopic technique requires a solid fragment and enables the surgeon to treat additional pathologies. In general, the arthroscopic technique makes the open posterior approach unnecessary. The arthroscopic techniques achieve slightly higher objective and subjective values compared to the open procedure, despite a higher rate of arthrofibrosis."

            "abstract": "Background:\n        \n      \n      Osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction receives much attention in orthopaedic science. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction is related to increased joint fluid volumes, bone marrow edema, and cartilage biochemical and morphological changes believed to cause fragile joint conditions. These joint conditions may not be able to adequately counter the imposed loads during sports.\n    \n\n\n          Hypothesis:\n        \n      \n      At 6 months after surgery, knee cartilage displays inferior quality in ACL-reconstructed knees when compared with controls. This inferior quality is influenced by the time to return to sports and/or by the time to surgery.\n    \n\n\n          Study design:\n        \n      \n      Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Fifteen patients treated with isolated ACL reconstruction were compared with 15 matched controls. In all participants, a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging cartilage evaluation was performed entailing quantitative morphological characteristics (3-dimensional volume/thickness), biochemical composition (T2/T2* mapping), and function (after a 30-minute run: in vivo deformation including recovery). Nonparametric statistics were executed reporting median (95% CI).\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      No volume and thickness between-group differences existed. In patients, medial femur (FM) T2 was higher (45.44 ms [95% CI, 40.64-51.49] vs 37.19 ms [95% CI, 34.67-40.39]; P = .028), whereas T2* was lower in the FM (21.81 ms [95% CI, 19.89-22.74] vs 24.29 ms [95% CI, 22.70-26.26]; P = .004), medial tibia (TM) (13.81 ms [95% CI, 10.26-16.78] vs 17.98 ms [95% CI, 15.95-18.90]; P = .016), and lateral tibia (TL) (14.69 ms [95% CI, 11.71-16.72] vs 18.62 ms [95% CI, 17.85-22.04]; P < .001). Patients showed diminished recovery at 30 minutes after a 30-minute run in the FM (-1.60% [95% CI, -4.82 to -0.13] vs 0.01% [95% CI, -0.34 to 1.23]; P = .040) and at 30 (-3.76% [95% CI, -9.29 to -1.78] vs 0.04% [95% CI, -1.52 to -0.72]; P = .004) and 45 minutes after exercise (-1.86% [95% CI, -4.66 to -0.40] vs 0.43% [95% CI, -0.91 to 0.77]; P = .024) in the TL. Eight patients returned to sports at 6 months or earlier. Return before 5 months (3/8 patients) was associated with increased cartilage thickness (in TM, TL, and lateral femur [FL]), deformation (in FL), and delayed recovery after running (in FL and FM). Median surgical delay was 10 weeks (range, 5-17 weeks). Surgery within 10 weeks (9/15 patients) was also associated with delayed cartilage recovery (in FL and FM). For the other parameters, no significant relationships could be established for either return to sports or surgical delay.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      At 6 months after surgery, cartilage in patients with ACL reconstruction shows diminished quality and in vivo resiliency compared with controls. Caution is advised in an early return to sports especially when dealing with patients who received prompt surgery. Possibly, high impacts on this qualitatively diminished cartilage might play a role in the development of osteoarthritis in ACL reconstruction. Replication in larger samples and follow-up are warranted."

We conducted a prospective study with randomized assignment of 18 patients into two groups: 9 patients in the \"motion\" group began 10 hours of daily continuous passive motion (CPM) on the 2nd postoperative day, while the remaining 9 in the \"delayed motion\" group used a soft hinged knee brace with knee hinges locked at 10 degrees of flexion and entered into the motion program on the 7th postoperative day. All knees were allowed full 0 degrees to 90 degrees of motion except for a total of seven knees with concomitant mensicus repairs and extraarticular reconstructions where 20 degrees to 90 degrees of motion was allowed, limiting the last 20 degrees of knee extension for the first 4 postoperative weeks to protect the repair. In all other respects, the rehabilitation program after surgery was the same for the two groups, including postoperative compression dressings, exercises, and weight-bearing status. Ten of the eighteen patients had acute ACL disruptions and 8 had chronic ACL insufficiencies. There was an even distribution of acute and chronic knee cases and of open and arthroscopic ligament procedures in the early and delayed motion groups. Associated surgery included four meniscus repairs, three medial collateral ligament repairs, and one lateral collateral ligament repair. Special suturing and fixation techniques were used at surgery to maintain the integrity of ligament and meniscus structures, allowing the surgeon to feel safe in subjecting the joint to early postoperative motion. The objective parameters measured were KT-1000 arthrometer measurements, Cybex isokinetic testing, girth measurements at four lower limb locations, range of motion goniometer measurements, postoperative pain medications, and days of hospitalization. Starting intermittent passive motion on the 2nd postoperative day did not increase joint effusion, hemarthrosis, or soft tissue swelling. In both motion groups, postoperative joint effusions were absent after the 14th postoperative day. There was no statistically significant difference in knee extension or flexion limits, pain medication used, or hospital stay in comparing the two knee motion programs. An important finding of this study was the significant decreases in thigh circumference that occurred within the first few weeks of surgery, which progressed despite a closely supervised inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation program.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common articular degenerative disease characterized by chronic pain, joint inflammation, and movement limitations, which are significantly influenced by aberrant epigenetic modifications of numerous OA-susceptible genes. Recent studies revealed that both the abnormal activation and differential expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs) might contribute to OA pathogenesis. In this study, we investigated the chondroprotective effects of a marine-derived HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat, on anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT)-induced experimental OA rats. The intra-articular administration of 2 or 10 µg of panobinostat (each group, n = 7) per week from the 6th to 17th week attenuates ACLT-induced nociceptive behaviors, including secondary mechanical allodynia and weight-bearing distribution. Histopathological and microcomputed tomography analysis showed that panobinostat significantly prevents cartilage degeneration after ACLT. Moreover, intra-articular panobinostat exerts hypertrophic effects in the chondrocytes of articular cartilage by regulating the protein expressions of HDAC4, HDAC6, HDAC7, runt-domain transcription factor-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-13. The study indicated that HDACs might have different modulations on the chondrocyte phenotype in the early stages of OA development. These results provide new evidence that panobinostat may be a potential therapeutic drug for OA."

The simulation of the trauma situation ex vivo showed no instability whereas increased translation and progressive loosening of secondary stabilizers was found after one year (posterior and total aptranslation, compliance index p < 0.05). The position of the density maxima of the subchondral mineralization are about the same on the operated and the non-operated knee joint. All tendons healed macroscopically, but micromorphology exhibited a persisting increase of cross-sectional areas, a low differentiated ultrastructure of the tendon and an increased cellularity (p < 0.01).\n    \n\n\n          Experimental:\n        \n      \n      1. intraarticular, extrasynovial tendons heal spontaneously even within the synovial environment; 2. healing is defective even one year postop.; 3. the postulate of the significance of the popliteus system for the stability of the knee is proven. Clinical: 1. (isolated) lesions of the popliteus go undetected with clinical and instrumented examination; 2. conservative treatment eventually results in increased posterior translational instability; 3. this will increase strain and load on the menisci and ACL- reconstructions."

Whole body vibration improves early rate of torque development in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. J Strength Cond Res 31(11): 2992-3000, 2017-The purpose of this study was to compare the effect of whole-body vibration (WBV) and local muscle vibration (LMV) on early and late quadriceps rate of torque development (RTD), and electromechanical delay (EMD) in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). Twenty individuals with ACLR were recruited for this study. Participants performed isometric squats while being exposed to WBV, LMV, or no vibration (control) in a randomized order during separate visits. Early and late quadriceps RTD and EMD were assessed during a maximal voluntary isometric knee extension before and immediately after WBV, LMV, or control. There was a significant condition by time interaction for early RTD (p = 0.045) but not for late RTD (p = 0.11) or EMD of the vastus medialis (p = 0.15), vastus lateralis (p = 0.17), or rectus femoris (p = 0.39). Post hoc analyses indicated a significant increase in early RTD after WBV (+5.59 N·m·s·kg; 95% confidence interval, 1.47-12.72; p = 0.007). No differences were observed in the LMV or control conditions, and no difference was observed between conditions at posttest. The ability to rapidly produce knee extension torque is essential to physical function, and WBV may be appropriate to aid in the restoration of RTD after ACLR."

            "abstract": "Injuries to the lateral collateral ligament and posterolateral corner of the knee, particularly when combined with anterior cruciate or posterior cruciate ligament injuries, can result in profound symptomatic knee instability. Although many surgical improvements have been made in reconstruction of anterior and posterior cruciate ligament injuries, reconstruction of the posterolateral corner has had less predictable results, with residual pathologic laxity especially in the chronic situation. This has stimulated many surgeons to recommend acute repair of posterolateral knee injuries. This article describes a more anatomic reconstruction of the posterolateral corner for chronic instability, recreating the lateral collateral ligament and popliteofibular ligament using either autogenous or allograft soft tissue and an interference screw technique. In a small clinical series, this has proven to restore varus rotation and external rotation patholaxities with a high degree of predictability."

            "abstract": "In the context of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery, anterolateral ligament reconstruction is now recognized as a reliable option to control rotatory instability and should be considered in the knee surgeon's modern armamentarium. By highlighting its daily practical application, this infographic presents the indications for this specific additional lateral augmentation, the anatomic and biomechanical principles that underline its rationale, and the clinical outcomes from recent large series. In 2013, Claes et al. updated the anterolateral ligament (ALL) concept, and numerous subsequent studies detailed its precise anatomy. It is now accepted that the femoral insertion is located proximal and posterior to the epicondyle. The biomechanical behavior of the ALL during the knee flexion path has been reported to provide control of tibial internal rotation during the pivot shift and with increasing knee flexion angles (>35). Clinically, when a patient presents with an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury, clinical examination (pivot shift test), radiography (Segond fracture), ultrasound, and 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging are useful to assess a combined ALL injury. The following indications for ALL reconstruction are now well established: ACL revision, high-grade pivot shift test, chronic ACL rupture, young patients, pivoting activities, and patients undergoing medial meniscus repair. It has been reported that anatomic and minimally invasive surgical techniques that control anterolateral rotatory instability can achieve successful outcomes without specific complications. Finally, the addition of ALL reconstruction does not delay postoperative rehabilitation, and no modification is required for an early rehabilitation protocol."

If the pulses have returned to normal, an arteriogram should be obtained. After the vascular repair has been done, a fasciotomy of the lower leg should be performed. In the young healthy active patient who does not have significant necrotic muscle or severe nerve injury, delayed reconstruction and early, very aggressive rehabilitation is recommended. Whether this treatment improves the results of this injury remains to be seen. Discussion with the vascular surgeon concerning the use of a tourniquet is recommended.

Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from 2 sources: the KANON study and the Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) database. Collectively, these 2 sources provided data from 928 ACL-injured patients. Utilities were measured by the Short Form-6 dimensions (SF-6D). Costs were estimated from a societal perspective in 2012 US dollars. Costs and utilities were discounted in accordance with the United States Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Principal outcome measures were average incremental costs, incremental effectiveness (as measured by QALYs), and net health benefits. Willingness to pay was set at $50,000, which is the currently accepted standard in the United States.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      In the base case, the ER group resulted in an incremental gain of 0.28 QALYs over the DR group, with a corresponding lower overall cost to society of $1572. Effectiveness gains were driven by the low utility of an unstable knee and the lower utility for the DR group. The cost of rehabilitation and the rate of additional surgery drove the increased cost of the DR group. The most sensitive variable was the rate of knee instability after initial rehabilitation. When the rate of instability falls to 51.5%, DR is less costly, and when the rate of instability falls below 18.0%, DR becomes the preferred cost-effective strategy.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusion:\n        \n      \n      An economic analysis of the timing of ACLR using data exclusively from the KANON trial, MOON cohort, and national average reimbursement revealed that early ACLR was more effective (improved QALYs) at a lower cost than rehabilitation plus optional delayed ACLR. Therefore, early ACLR should be the preferred treatment strategy from a societal health system perspective."

            "abstract": "Purpose:\n        \n      \n      The purpose of this study was to measure graft tension in vivo in anatomic double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction during active knee extension, as well as to investigate the effect of loading a weight around the ankle on graft tension.\n    \n\n\n          Methods:\n        \n      \n      Seven patients with chronic ACL injury underwent anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Two grafts were temporarily fixed to the 2 tension-adjustable force gauges on the anterior tibial cortex, after they were fixed on the femur. After the creep within the femur-ACL graft-tibia construct was removed, 10 N of the initial tension was applied to each graft at 20 degrees. First, tension to the anteromedial (AM) and posterolateral (PL) grafts was continuously measured during passive extension from 90 degrees to 0 degrees with the patient under general anesthesia. Then, after the patient was awoken from anesthesia, graft tension was again recorded while the knee was actively extended by the patient in the same manner. Finally, after a 2-kg weight was placed around the ankle, the tension of each graft was measured again during active knee extension by the patient himself or herself.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      During passive extension motion, the tension of the AM graft was 19.3 +/- 4.7 N, whereas that of the PL graft was 24.5 +/- 5.9 N at 0 degrees. The tension of each graft increased when approaching full extension. During active knee extension motion, the tension of the AM graft was 24.0 +/- 6.1 N, whereas that of the PL graft was 30.8 +/- 7.3 N at 0 degrees. When the 2-kg weight was placed around the ankle during active motion, the tension was significantly higher than that with no weight at all flexion angles.\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Graft tension was greater during active motion than that during passive motion, and graft tension during active motion increased with a weight placed around the ankle. The highest graft tension was 62.8 N at 0 degrees of flexion with a 2-kg weight placed around the ankle, when 20 N of initial tension was applied at 20 degrees of flexion in anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction. Thus care must be taken during active extension exercise with weights, especially in the first few weeks after ACL reconstruction, because graft tension increases with an increase in initial tension and easily reaches a critical level.\n    \n\n\n          Clinical relevance:\n        \n      \n      Our findings suggest that active knee extension exercise should be performed in moderation in the early phase after ACL reconstruction."

The fibrosis is caused by a pathologic quantity or quality of collagen fiber formation in the knee or in the capsular structures, causing irreversible loss of range of motion, restricted patellar motion and finally patella baja with frank osteoarthritis of the patella. The major factors inducing fibrosis are notch impingement, development of a cyclops on an anterior cruciate ligament graft, scarring of the fat pad and the retinacula and adhesions in the recesses of the joint. Our therapeutic concept includes aggressive physiotherapy and an early arthroscopic procedure if conservative measures fail. A posterior capsulotomy is performed from a posteromedial arthrotomy in cases with flexion contracture persisting over a number of years. In 16 patients reviewed 17 months after arthroscopic treatment of arthrofibrosis the average improvement in range of motion was 13 degrees for extension and 25 degrees for flexion. A further 7 patients with chronic flexion contractures persisting for 1 year or more were treated with a posterior capsulotomy and reviewed 18 months after surgery. The average gain for extension was 15 degrees in these patients at follow-up."

The associated pain and pathohistological changes in cartilage are common features of OA in both humans and animal models. Shea nut oil extract (SheaFlex75) contains a high triterpenoid concentration and has demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic effects in both human and animal studies. In this study, we aim to investigate the potential of SheaFlex75 to prevent articular cartilage deterioration in a rat model of chronic OA progression. By employing anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) with medial meniscectomy (MMx)-induced OA, we found attenuation of both early and chronic onset OA pain and cartilage degeneration in ACLT+MMx rats receiving SheaFlex75 dietary supplementation. Under long-term oral administration, the rats with induced OA presented sustained protection of both pain and OA cartilage integrity compared to the OA-control rats. Moreover, rats subjected to long-term SheaFlex75 ingestion showed normal biochemical profiles (AST, BUN and total cholesterol) and presented relatively lower triglycerides (TGs) and body weights than the OA-control rats, which suggested the safety of prolonged use of this oil extract. Based on the present evidence, preventive management is advised to delay/prevent onset and progression in OA patients. Therefore, we suggest that SheaFlex75 may be an effective management strategy for symptom relief and cartilage protection in patients with both acute and chronic OA."

Ligament injuries included 19 ACL/PCL/posterolateral instabilities, 9 ACL/PCL/medial cruciate ligament (MCL) instabilities, 6 ACL/PCL/posterolateral/MCL instabilities, and 1 ACL/PCL instability. All knees had grade III preoperative ACL/PCL laxity and were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively with arthrometer testing, 3 different knee ligament rating scales, stress radiography, and physical examination. Arthroscopically assisted combined ACL/PCL reconstructions were performed using the single-incision endoscopic ACL technique and the single femoral tunnel-single bundle transtibial tunnel PCL technique. PCLs were reconstructed with allograft Achilles tendon (in 26 cases), autograft bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) (in 7 cases), and autograft semitendinosus/gracilis (in 2 cases). ACLs were reconstructed with autograft BPTB (16 cases), allograft BPTB (12 cases), Achilles tendon allograft (6 cases), and autograft semitendinosus/gracilis (1 case). MCL injuries were treated with bracing or open reconstruction. Posterolateral instability was treated with biceps femoris tendon transfer, with or without primary repair, and posterolateral capsular shift procedures as indicated.\n    \n\n\n          Results:\n        \n      \n      Postoperative physical examination revealed normal posterior drawer/tibial step-off in 16 of 35 (46%) knees. Normal Lackman and pivot-shift test results were found in 33 of 35 (94%) knees. Posterolateral stability was restored to normal in 6 of 25 (24%) knees, and tighter than normal knee results were found in 19 of 25 (76%) knees evaluated with the external rotation thigh foot angle test. In this group, 30 degrees varus stress testing was normal in 22 of 25 (88%) knees, and grade 1 laxity was found in 3 of 25 (12%) knees. 30 degrees valgus stress testing was normal in 7 of 7 (100%) surgically treated MCL tears, and in 7 of 8 (87.5%) brace-treated knees. Postoperative KT-1000 arthrometer testing mean side-to-side difference measurements were 2.7 mm (PCL screen), 2.6 mm (corrected posterior), and 1.0 mm (corrected anterior) measurements, a statistically significant improvement from preoperative status (P =.001). Postoperative stress radiographic side-to-side difference measurements measured at 90 degrees of knee flexion and 32 lb posteriorly directed proximal force were 0 to 3 mm in 11 of 21 (52.3%) knees, 4 to 5 mm in 5 of 21 (23.8%), and 6 to 10 mm in 4 of 21 (19%) knees. Postoperative Lysholm, Tegner, and HSS knee ligament rating scale mean values were 91.2, 5.3, and 86.8, respectively, showing a statistically significant improvement from preoperative status (P =.001).\n    \n\n\n          Conclusions:\n        \n      \n      Combined ACL/PCL instabilities can be successfully treated with arthroscopic reconstruction and the appropriate collateral ligament surgery. Statistically significant improvement is noted from the preoperative condition at 2- to 10-year follow-up using objective parameters of knee ligament rating scales, arthrometer testing, stress radiography, and physical examination. Postoperatively, these knees are not normal, but they are functionally stable. Continuing technical improvements will probably improve future results."

Ninety-one young (x = 25.4 years), active patients were available for an average follow-up of 36.4 months and included 55 patients in the PAT group and 36 in the DST&G group. No patients had previously undergone ACL reconstruction. Knee stability data were obtained yearly and included scores from the Lysholm questionnaire, Lachman exam, and KT-1000 arthrometer at 30 pounds (KT30) and maximum pull (KTMAX). Both autografts were of comparable size, tension, and isometricity. Two separate factorial multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) were used to compare the two series for 3 follow-up years in the categories acute and chronic (A versus C) and meniscectomy and no meniscectomy (M versus NM). Results indicated that in all categories and follow-up years, PAT patients had consistently greater knee stability compared with the DST&G group. Overall MANOVA results showed significantly lower (p < 0.01) Lachman scores in PAT versus DST&G in each of the 3 follow-up years. Significantly lower (p < 0.05) KT30 and KTMAX values were also observed for PAT compared with DST&G in year 1. MANOVA results also showed lower (p < 0.01) Lachman scores in PAT-A versus DST&G-A for 3 follow-up years. Lachman scores in PAT-NM patients were lower (p < 0.01) for postop years 1 and 2 compared with DST&G-NM.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

            "abstract": "Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) of the knee is often attributed to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus injury. The development of PTOA, however, does not seem to depend on whether or not the damaged ACL is reconstructed. There has been a need to develop animal models to study the mechanisms of PTOA following reconstruction of a traumatized knee. Eighteen rabbits underwent closed-joint trauma to produce ACL rupture and meniscus damage. Then, for the first time, the traumatized knee was surgically repaired in this animal model. Upon euthanasia at 1-, 3- or 6-month post-trauma, joint stability, cartilage morphology and mechanical properties, as well as histology of the cartilage and subchondral bone were evaluated. Trauma-induced knee injury involved 72% mid-substance ACL rupture, 28% partial ACL tear and 56% concurrent medial meniscal damage. ACL reconstruction effectively restored joint stability by reducing joint laxity to a level similar to that in the contralateral intact knee. Compared to their contralateral controls, reconstructed limbs showed osteoarthritic changes to the cartilage and subchondral bone as early as 1-month post-trauma. The degeneration progressed over time up to 6-month. Overall, the medial compartments had more tissue damage than their corresponding lateral counterparts. Damage patterns to the ACL, the frequency of observed concurrent meniscal injury, and reductions in cartilage integrity and health were consistent with clinical observations of human patients who undergo ACL injury and reconstruction. Thus, we believe the combined closed-joint injury and surgical repair lapine model of PTOA, being first-ever and clinically relevant, shows promise to evaluate well-targeted therapeutics and other interventions for this chronic disease."

Sixty-six international experts on the management of ACL injuries, representing 18 countries, convened and participated in a process based on the Delphi method of achieving consensus. Proposed consensus statements were drafted by the Scientific Organising Committee and Session Chairs. Panel participants reviewed preliminary statements prior to the meeting and provided initial agreement and comments on the statement via online survey. During the meeting, discussion and debate occurred for each statement, after which a final vote was then held. Eighty per cent agreement was defined a priori as consensus. A total of 11 of 13 statements on operative versus non-operative treatment of ACL injury reached consensus during the Symposium. Nine statements achieved unanimous support, two reached strong consensus, one did not achieve consensus, and one was removed due to redundancy in the information provided. In highly active patients engaged in jumping, cutting and pivoting sports, early anatomical ACL reconstruction is recommended due to the high risk of secondary meniscus and cartilage injuries with delayed surgery, although a period of progressive rehabilitation to resolve impairments and improve neuromuscular function is recommended. For patients who seek to return to straight plane activities, non-operative treatment with structured, progressive rehabilitation is an acceptable treatment option. However, with persistent functional instability, or when episodes of giving way occur, anatomical ACL reconstruction is indicated.

However, there may be instances where the opportunity cost of delayed surgery for the patient may be unacceptable. Concomitant meniscus injuries may also prevent the patient from regaining range of motion in the preoperative period. Every week that surgery is delayed may increase pain and impair mobility for this group of patients. We investigate the functional and clinical outcomes in patients with ACL surgery in the immediate 3-week period following ACL injury. A cohort study was performed to compare the outcome of early ACL (less than 3 weeks after injury) and late ACL surgery (more than 3 weeks after surgery). A total of 58 patients were followed up at fixed time points over a 2-year period. Clinical measurements (range of motion and knee laxity scores) and functional outcome scores (International Knee Documentation Committee, Lysholm's Knee and Tegner's scores) were used to document outcomes over time. The mean time to surgery from the time of injury in the early ACL surgery group was 2 weeks (standard deviation [SD] = 0.45) and the 20 weeks (SD = 9.64) in the late ACL surgery group. The absence or presence of meniscal injuries had no significant effect on the improvement over time for both groups of patients (p > 0.05). Patients in the early ACL group had faster rates of improvement for clinical measurements and functional outcome scores but had started out initially with poorer outcomes at baseline. However, both groups had comparable outcomes (p > 0.05) at the 1- and 2-year mark postsurgery. Patients in both groups had no adverse outcomes.

These results are influenced by graft choice, with a higher quadriceps strength deficit for BPTB grafts. STG grafts induce a higher hamstring strength deficit compared with BPTB grafts. Functional assessment is improved at 9 and 12 months postoperatively compared with preoperatively regardless of graft type. However, an increased preoperative quadriceps strength deficit results in a lower limb symmetry index at 6 and 9 months postoperatively.\n    \n\n\n          Level of evidence:\n        \n      \n      Level IV, therapeutic case series."
