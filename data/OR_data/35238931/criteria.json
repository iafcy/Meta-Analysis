            "criteria": "Studies were eligible for inclusion if they (1) used CCT as the primary intervention or combined CCT with other types of interventions; (2) used a placebo, passive control conditions, traditional cognitive training, or single training tasks as control conditions; (3) reported changes between baseline and posttraining; (4) included participants 18 years or older and (5) were randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Studies were excluded if they (1) were not associated with HIV, (2) were research protocols or feedback reports, (3) were case reports, or (4) did not report findings for domains of interest. Duplicate studies were removed using EndNote X9 software (Clarivate), and 2 reviewers (J.W. and J.H.) separately selected search results based on titles and abstracts. Assessment of full-text articles to determine eligibility of the remaining studies was conducted by the same 2 reviewers. Disagreements about eligibility between reviewers were resolved through discussion with 2 investigators (B.S. and T.Z.). A detailed description of reasons for exclusion is available in eTable 3 in the Supplement, and the study selection process is shown in Figure 1.",
