            "abstract": "## OBJECTIVE\nWe aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive working memory (WM) training (WMT) program, the corresponding neural correlates, and LMX1A-rs4657412 polymorphism on the adaptive WMT, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) participants compared to seronegative (SN) controls.\n## METHODS\nA total of 201 of 206 qualified participants completed baseline assessments before randomization to 25 sessions of adaptive WMT or nonadaptive WMT. A total of 74 of 76 (34 HIV, 42 SN) completed adaptive WMT and all 40 completed nonadaptive WMT (20 HIV, 20 SN) and were assessed after 1 month, and 55 adaptive WMT participants were also assessed after 6 months. Nontrained near-transfer WM tests (Digit-Span, Spatial-Span), self-reported executive functioning, and functional magnetic resonance images during 1-back and 2-back tasks were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit, and LMX1A-rs4657412 was genotyped in all participants.\n## RESULTS\nAlthough HIV participants had slightly lower cognitive performance and start index than SN at baseline, both groups improved on improvement index (>30%; false discovery rate [FDR] corrected p\u2009<\u20090.0008) and nontrained WM tests after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001), but not after nonadaptive WMT (training by training type corrected, p\u2009=\u20090.01 to p\u2009=\u20090.05) 1 month later. HIV participants (especially LMX1A-G carriers) also had poorer self-reported executive functioning than SN, but both groups reported improvements after adaptive WMT (Global: training FDR corrected, p\u2009=\u20090.004), and only HIV participants improved after nonadaptive WMT. HIV participants also had greater frontal activation than SN at baseline, but brain activation decreased in both groups at 1 and 6 months after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p\u2009<\u20090.0001), with normalization of brain activation in HIV participants, especially the LMX1A-AA carriers (LMX1A genotype by HIV status, cluster-corrected-p\u2009<\u20090.0001).\n## INTERPRETATION\nAdaptive WMT, but not nonadaptive WMT, improved WM performance in both SN and HIV participants, and the accompanied decreased or normalized brain activation suggest improved neural efficiency, especially in HIV-LMX1A-AA carriers who might have greater dopaminergic reserve. These findings suggest that adaptive WMT may be an effective adjunctive therapy for WM deficits in HIV participants. ANN NEUROL 2017;81:17-34.\n",

Thirty-three HIV+ adults aged 50+ completed neurocognitive testing and were randomized to either active (n\u2009=\u200917) or sham (n\u2009=\u200916) tDCS. Both conditions received 10 1-hour sessions of SOP CRT, with either active or sham tDCS for the first 20 minutes. Participants then completed a posttest assessment. Repeated measures analysis of variance examining Time X Condition showed small-to-medium effects in the expected direction for an executive (d\u2009=\u20090.36), and SOP measure (d\u2009=\u20090.49), while medium-to-large effects were observed for an executive/attention (d\u2009=\u20090.60) and oral reading measure (d\u2009=\u20090.75). The only statistically significant interaction was the oral reading measure. Small-to-medium and medium-to-large effects (ds\u2009=\u20090.32, 0.58) were found for two SOP measures in the opposite direction (sham group showing greater improvements). Further trials of CRT and tDCS in this population are needed, including larger samples and a nonactive control and tDCS only condition, as is determination of which parameters of each technique (e.g., tDCS montage, timing of tDCS, domain targeted in CRT, number of sessions) are most effective in improving cognitive outcomes, durability of training gains, and translation to everyday functioning.\n",

            "abstract": "The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and stability over time of a cognitive rehabilitation protocol (restorative and compensatory approach) in HIV/AIDS patients with HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). At baseline, 32 HIV/AIDS patients (16 with and 16 without HAND) were assessed with a neuropsychological battery (i.e., pre-assessment) consisting of 22 tests covering eight cognitive domains. Then, the experimental group was administered over 4 months a cognitive rehabilitation protocol aimed at improving four cognitive domains by means of eight paper and pencil/computer-based exercises. The control group received guideline-adherent clinical care (i.e., standard of care). At the end of the cognitive treatment, both groups were re-administered the neuropsychological battery (i.e., post-assessment). Additionally, 6 months after post-assessment, the experimental group was given the same neuropsychological battery (i.e., follow up-assessment). In order to test the efficacy of the cognitive rehabilitation protocol, we compared between groups the results of the neuropsychological battery at the pre- and post-assessments. In order to evaluate the stability over time, the effects of the cognitive rehabilitation protocol was examined comparing within the experimental group the results of the neuropsychological battery at post- and follow up-assessments. Our results show that the two groups did not differ at the pre-assessment, but differed at post-assessment. Specifically, the experimental group showed a significant improvement in five domains (Learning and memory, Abstraction/executive functioning, Verbal fluency, Attention/working memory, and Functional), whereas the control group significantly worsened in the same domains. The improvement of the experimental group did not change in the follow up-assessment in two domains (Abstraction/executive functioning, Attention/working memory, and Functional). Overall, these findings support the efficacy and, to some extent, the stability over time of our cognitive rehabilitation protocol.\n",

In this randomized clinical trial, we assigned 21 adult PLWH to either an experimental cognitive training intervention or an attention-matched control training intervention. Participants completed 12 training sessions across 10\u00a0weeks with assessments at baseline and post-training. Session attendance was excellent and participants rated the program positively. Participants in the experimental arm demonstrated improved working memory function over time; participants in the control arm showed no change. Our results suggest that cognitive training may be a promising intervention for working memory impairment in PLWH and should be evaluated further.\n",

This study examined whether cognition can be improved using a framework targeting impaired individual cognitive domains in PWH with HAND.

Baseline cognitive performance was assessed on eight cognitive domains. A theoretical framework was used to determine the two cognitive domains selected for training. With priority on speed of processing (SOP) and attention impairments, participants received SOP and/or attention training if such impairments were detected; if not, participants were assigned to cognitive training in one/two of the least impaired cognitive domains contributing to their HAND diagnosis. Global cognitive score was slightly improved following training (p\u2009=\u20090.256; d\u2009=\u2009-\u20090.21), but it was\u00a0not significant.

SOP training also improved functioning in other cognitive domains. This individualized cognitive intervention did not change HAND status, but it did result in improved SOP, in turn yielding improvement in other cognitive domains.\n",

            "abstract": "Half of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Fortunately, cognitive training programs can improve function across cognitive domains, which may translate to everyday functioning. The Training on Purpose (TOPS) Study was designed to reverse HAND by targeting cognitive training to specific cognitive impairments that contributed to the diagnosis. A secondary aim of TOPS was to determine whether such cognitive training improved subjective and objective everyday functioning. In this two-group pre-post experimental design study, 109 adults with HAND were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact control group (no training) or (2) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group. Each participant received approximately 10\u2009hours of cognitive training in two selected cognitive domains based on her/his individual baseline cognitive performance. Thus, 20\u2009hours of individualized training on these two cognitive domains occurred over a course of 12\u2009weeks in 1-2\u2009hour sessions. Specific to the secondary aim of TOPS, measures of everyday functioning were administered before and after cognitive training to examine transfer effects. The analyses revealed that in general, speed of processing training produced benefits in everyday functioning as measured by the medication adherence visual analogue scale and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living test. Inconsistent findings were found for the other seven cognitive training protocols in either improving everyday functioning or reducing perceived everyday functioning; however, there may be other contributing factors that obscured such effects needing further research. This study demonstrated that some training protocols vary in efficacy in altering both objective and subjective everyday functioning ability.\n",
