In the United States in 2018, approximately 51% of people 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PWH) were 
aged 50 and older, due both to increasing lifespan of PWH 
and increased rates of new infections in older people (CDC, 
2020); this percentage is estimated to increase to 70% by 
2030 (Wing, 2017). The population of PWH is particularly 
susceptible to cardiac, metabolic, and neurovascular changes 
associated with cognitive aging that may be accelerated by 
HIV (Smail & Brew, 2018). Approximately half of PWH 
experience cognitive symptoms that, if severe enough, result 
in a diagnosis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder 
(HAND) (Wei et al., 2020). Combined with nonpathological 
effects of aging on cognition, the prevalence and severity of 
HAND will likely grow along with the aging HIV popula- 
tion (Goodkin et al., 2017; Smail & Brew, 2018; Vance et al., 
2013). Cognitive impairments in HIV are related to poorer 
everyday functioning on tasks such as instrumental activities 
of daily living (IADL) (e.g., following directions, counting 
change) (Vance, Fazeli, & Gakumo, 2013), driving (Vance 
et al., 2014), medication adherence (Caballero et al., 2019), 
and online shopping and banking (Woods et al., 2017). 
These effects on everyday function are likely to be of greater 
concern to PWH than how well they perform on lab-based 
neuropsychological tests (Kordovski et al., 2019). Given the 
known association between cognition and everyday func- 
tioning, if improving cognition is possible, the same may 
hold for improving everyday functioning. Cognitive training 
represents one strategy to do this. 
There has been extensive publicity and research sur- 
rounding the concept of “Brain Training” or cognitive train- 
ing in recent years. For a recent review of cognitive training, 
including a meta-analysis of such interventions and their 
possible impact on both healthy older adults and those expe- 
riencing mild cognitive impairment see Basak et al. (2020).

that cognitive training is effective in improving cognition in 
both healthy adults, as well as those with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), even though all 215 studies did not

ABSTRACT 
Half of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have HIV-associated neurocognitive dis- 
order (HAND). Fortunately, cognitive training programs can improve function across cognitive 
domains, which may translate to everyday functioning. The Training on Purpose (TOPS) Study was 
designed to reverse HAND by targeting cognitive training to specific cognitive impairments that 
contributed to the diagnosis. A secondary aim of TOPS was to determine whether such cognitive

training improved subjective and objective everyday functioning. 
experimental design study, 109 adults with HAND were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact 
control group (no training) or (2) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group. Each par- 
ticipant received approximately 10 hours of cognitive training in two selected cognitive domains 
based on her/his individual baseline cognitive performance. Thus, 20 hours of individualized train- 
ing on these two cognitive domains occurred over a course of 12 weeks in 1–2 hour sessions. 
Specific to the secondary aim of TOPS, measures of everyday functioning were administered 
before and after cognitive training to examine transfer effects. The analyses revealed that in gen- 
eral, speed of processing training produced benefits in everyday functioning as measured by the 
medication adherence visual analogue scale and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living 
test. Inconsistent findings were found for the other seven cognitive training protocols in either 
improving everyday functioning or reducing perceived everyday functioning; however, there may 
be other contributing factors that obscured such effects needing further research. This study dem- 
onstrated that some training protocols vary in efficacy in altering both objective and subjective 
everyday functioning ability. 


demonstrate positive effects individually. These findings are 
consistent with another systematic review and meta-analysis 
of cognitive speed of processing (SOP) training (Edwards 
et al., 2018), which evaluated 44 studies from 17 randomized 
trials using the Institute of Medicine criteria. This analysis 
indicated that training enhanced neural outcomes (e.g., pupil 
diameter, P3b amplitude), and in particular the cognitive 
outcomes of SOP. 
In a systematic review of cognitive training programs 
looking specifically at PWH, Vance et al. (2019) identified 
13 studies and concluded that, in general, cognitive training 
improved performance in the cognitive domain that was tar- 
geted (e.g., executive functioning training improved execu- 
tive functioning ability). In some studies, cognitive training 
that targets one cognitive domain not only transferred to 
improvement 
in other cognitive domains, but also to 
improvements in measures of everyday functioning. For 
example, in a randomized sample of 46 PWH (no-contact 
control group or SOP training group), those in the SOP 
training group demonstrated improved performance on both 
a measure of SOP (Useful Field of View Test) and the 
Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) test 
(Vance et al., 2012). 

With respect to everyday function, cognitive impairment 
in PWH has been shown to be associated with declines in 
both basic (e.g., bathing) activities of daily living (BADLs) 
and IADLs (e.g., medication adherence) (Johs et al., 2017). 
Likewise, in a sample of 162 PWH and without HIV, Vance 
et al. (2013) found a significant correlation between the per- 
formance-based TIADL test and several measures of SOP as 
well as verbal 
learning and memory, highlighting the 
importance of cognitive function on daily functioning. 
Similarly, significant correlations were observed between 
scores on the Observed Tasks of Daily Living (OTDL) test, a 
measure of complex everyday functioning, and neuropsycho- 
logical performance measures of SOP, executive function, 
and verbal 
In a separate study,

ratings. The 
between cognitive 
impairments and BADL and IADL 
impairments in older PWH, coupled with evidence that cog- 
nitive training yields sustained improvement in cognitive 
impairments, supported exploring the possible effect of tar- 
geted cognitive training on everyday activities. Using the 
logic underlying targeted cognitive domain training (Vance 
et al., 2018), 
in certain cognitive 
improvements 
domains may translate to meaningful improvement in every- 
day activities in which people are experiencing difficulties. 
Similarly, since SOP and attention are core cognitive abilities 
which play a role in all other cognitive domains (Fellows 
et al., 2014), targeted SOP or attention training might result 
in particularly meaningful 
in everyday 
functioning. 



the Training on Purpose Study 
(TOPS) was to examine whether targeted cognitive training 
can reduce the prevalence and severity of HAND in PWH 
40 years of age and older, as those who are aging with HIV 
are more likely to develop HAND than younger PWH 
(Waldrop et al., 2021). Although we were not able to reduce 
the prevalence of HAND (Vance et al., in press), using per- 
formance-based cognitive tests representing eight cognitive 
domains 
to examine training effects, we were able to 
improve functioning in several cognitive domains; in par- 
ticular, SOP training and executive functioning training 
were particularly robust. Thus, the secondary aim of TOPS, 
reported in this article, was to examine whether targeted 
cognitive training would improve subjective and objective 
measures of everyday activities. 



In TOPS, we examined the effectiveness of an algorithm of 
targeted cognitive training to decrease the severity and 
prevalence of HAND, as well as explore such training effects 
on everyday functioning (Vance et al., in press). Utilizing a 
two-group 
participants 
experimental 
40 years and older were randomized to either: (1) a no-con- 
tact control group (no cognitive training at all), or (2) an 
Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group that com- 
pleted 20 hours of cognitive training focused in two cogni- 
tive domains (10 hours each) that contributed the their 
at 
HAND diagnosis. The University 
Birmingham’s Institutional Review Board approved the eth- 
ical conduct of this study. 



As seen from the Consort Diagram (Figure 1), participants 
were recruited from flyers posted at AIDS service organiza- 
tions, an HIV/AIDS clinic, businesses in the community 
(e.g., 
laundromats), AIDS fundraising events, and local 
churches. Those interested called a telephone number listed 
on the recruitment materials and were screened over the 
telephone to determine basic eligibility. Inclusion criteria 
included: (a) (cid:1)40 years of age; (b) diagnosed with HIV for 
þ1 year; (c) not diagnosed with a neuromedical condition 
that impairs cognition (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, schizophre- 
nia, traumatic brain injury); (d) not currently undergoing 
chemotherapy and/or radiation; (e) not legally blind or deaf; 
(f) proficient in spoken/written English; and (g) residing 
within 100 miles of the research center. From this, 135 par- 
ticipants consented at baseline and were administered a 
comprehensive neuropsychological battery to determine 
whether

the Frascati 
(Blackstone et al., 2012). The 109 participants who met the 
HAND criteria (5 or higher on the Global Clinical Rating 
score) were informed of this and then randomized into the 
study. Those 26 participants without HAND were also 
informed and their participation was no longer requested. 
Compensation for time and effort was provided for the pre- 
test/posttest assessments ($50 each) and the cognitive train- 
ing sessions ($15/hour of cognitive training). 




depressive symptomatology. A score of 16 or higher reflects 
significant depressive symptomology. Participants with sig- 
nificant depressive symptomatology were provide educa- 
tional and referral information. 
Cognitive domains and Frascati criteria 
Using standardized normed cognitive performance tests at 
baseline (pretest) and posttest, eight cognitive domains were 
assessed. These cognitive performance tests are routinely uti- 
lized in the neuroAIDS research (Blackstone et al., 2012; 
Woods et al., 2008). T-scores of the cognitive tests approxi- 
mate clinical ratings of objective cognitive functioning for 
each of the eight domains ranging from 1 (above average, if 
T-score is 55 or higher) to 9 (severe impairment, if t-score 
is 19 or below). This cognitive battery consisted of: (1) SOP 
(Trails A, Stroop Color Naming Test); (2) attention (Paced 
Auditory Serial Attention Test); 
(3) executive function 
(4) spatial 
(Stroop Interference, Lezak 1995), Trails B); 
learning and memory (Benton Visual Retention Test – 
Revised); (5) delayed spatial learning and memory (Benton 
Visual Retention Test Delayed – Revised); (6) spatial visual- 
learning and 
ization (WAIS IV Block Design); (7) verbal 
memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised); and (8) 
delayed verbal 
learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal 
Learning Test/Delayed – Revised). From the baseline assess- 
ment, impairments in cognitive functioning were identified 
for 
Procedures/ 
Treatment section). 




Using each participant’s neuropsychological test scores, 
an algorithm was used to calculate a Global Clinical Rating 
score ranging from 1 (above average) to 9 (severe impair- 
ment). If two domains were in the impaired range (5–9), 
then the Global Clinical Rating score reflected the more 
severe level of impairment identified. In this continuum, a 
global 
impairment score of 5 or higher was indicative of 
HAND (Blackstone et al., 2012). Technically, other factors 
such as impairments in everyday functioning and the contri- 
bution of comorbidities to cognitive impairments are taken 
into consideration when diagnosing HAND. For our study, 
only cognitive performance was used in making this diagno- 
sis. (For more information regarding HAND and other 
al., 2018). 
TOPS protocol procedures, 
Therefore, our study required participants to meet at least 
the minimum criteria for HAND, which is the mild cogni- 
tive impairment criterion for ANI (deficits that are 1 SD 
below the mean in 2 cognitive domains). 


Medication adherence visual analogue scale (VAS) 
This measure of medication adherence provides a visual 
analogue scale/line from 0% to 50% to 100% and asks par- 
ticipants to mark an X on that line that corresponds to 
“What percent of your HIV medications did you take?” dur- 
ing the past month. The percentage is the value used in 
analyses (Giordano et al., 2004). 


Participants were administered a (cid:3)1.5 hour neuropsycho- 
logical and everyday functioning assessment at the research 
center at baseline and posttest. The measures administered 
during these assessments relevant to this article are listed in 
the following sections. 
Demographics 
Age, gender, years of education, and employment were indi- 
cated by self-report at baseline. 
HIV health status 
Each participants’ medical providers provided the following 
information: HIV-positive diagnosis 
confirmation, years 
diagnosed with HIV, current and nadir CD4þ lymphocyte 
count, current quantitative HIV RNA by PRC (viral load), 
and types of antiretroviral HIV medication. 
Health information 
A health questionnaire was administered at baseline in 
which participants indicated medical comorbidities, pre- 
scribed medications, tobacco use (i.e., how many cigarettes 
per day smoked), and alcohol use (i.e., number of drinks on 
a typical day when drinking). 
Depression 
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale- 
Revised (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) was used to measure 


Simplified medication adherence questionnaire 
This questionnaire asks three key questions about taking 
one’s medication as prescribed and in a timely manner; 
higher scores indicate better adherence. Two items are on a 
6-point scale and one item on a 5-point scale; this last item 
was transformed mathematically to be on a 6-point scale 
and then summed with the other two items. Higher scores 
indicate better medication adherence. This measure is vali- 
dated with virological outcomes and has good internal con- 
sistency (a ¼ 0.75) and inter-observer agreement (88.2%) 
(Knobel et al., 2002). 
Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) test 
This performance-based test measures the accuracy and time 
it takes to perform five IADLs used in everyday functioning 
including finding a number in a phone book, counting 
change, reading ingredients from food cans, 
locating food 
items on a shelf, and reading directions from a medication 
bottle. A scoring algorithm accounts for the time and accur- 
acy, generating a score with lower scores indicating better 
functioning. Test–retest reliability is 0.64. (Goverover et al., 
2007; Owsley et al., 2002). 
Modified Lawton and Brody Activities of Daily Living 
(ADL) questionnaire 
This self-reported questionnaire consists of 16 ADL domains 
that measure a participant’s self-perceived functional status, 
specifically their decline from prior functioning and need 
for assistance. Scores include a total BADL complaints (e.g., 
dressing) continuous score as well as a total IADL com- 
plaints (e.g., laundry) continuous score, with higher scores 
reflecting more 
impaired activity domains. An IADL 
Dependence categorical variable was also generated, such 
that if current functioning level was lower than the highest 
level of functioning for at least two domains, this resulted in 
a classification of IADL Dependent (Fazeli et al., 2014; 
Lawton & Brody, 1969). 

Participants with HAND were randomized in a 1:1.4 ratio to 
the control group or the cognitive training group to slightly 
favor more participants being assigned the experimental 
treatment as this was the focus of the study with limited 
resources. We employed a block randomization strategy to 
safeguard balanced assignment between Africans Americans/ 
Caucasians and men/women. We did not randomize accord- 
ing to HAND severity; however, baseline global cognitive 
score between the two groups were similar and not signifi- 
group ¼ 7.18 
cantly 
(SD ¼ 1.52) & the treatment group ¼ 7.48, p ¼ 0.26). Time 
and posttest was on average 85.25 
between baseline 
(SD ¼ 48.69) days 
control group ¼ 84.48 
(no-contact 
(SD ¼ 27.76) days; treatment group ¼ 85.92 (SD ¼ 61.22) 
days, p ¼ 0.89). In the no-contact control group, participants 
received no cognitive training (or any type of intervention 
or sham-intervention) and did not have contact with the 



researchers between the baseline and posttest assessments; 
these participants only received the baseline and posttest 
assessments. After posttest, the control group did not receive 
the cognitive training. In the treatment group, participants 
engaged in ten hours of training for two cognitive domains 
(20 hours total) for which impairments were detected at 
baseline. All cognitive training occurred at the research cen- 
ter under the supervision of a neuropsychological trainer to 
monitor participants’ progress, assist with any computer 
issues, offer reassurance and reinforcement, prevent drift in 
the protocol, and ensure treatment fidelity. 
Based on the concerns of cognitive training fatigue lead- 
ing to attrition as well as the diminishing therapeutic return 
of over training (i.e., U-shaped dosage-therapeutic response 
reported by Lampit et al., 2014), we selected a training dose 
of ten hours in each of two cognitive domains. In the cogni- 
tive training literature, a therapeutic dose of 10 hours is 
appropriate to increase function in a targeted cognitive 
domain (Ball et al., 2002; Vance et al., 2012); but to reem- 
phasize, participants 
treatment group received 
10 hours of training for each of the two cognitive domains 
in which they received training for a total of 20 hours of 
cognitive training altogether. 

A problem associated with applying cognitive training to 
address HAND is that participants may have impairments in 
all eight cognitive domains. Training in more than two 
domains represents significant participant burden as such 
training can be fatiguing, resulting in non-adherence. Thus, 
we created a cognitive training algorithm to target the cog- 
nitive domains that hypothetically could best reduce the 
prevalence of HAND for each individual participant. The 
Framework 
Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training 
(Vance et al., 2018) was developed explicitly for this study. 
In step one, participants with cognitive impairments in 
either SOP or attention were assigned cognitive training tar- 
geting their least compromised (but still impaired) cognitive 
domain (i.e., closest to a cut-off of 1 SD below the demo- 
graphically adjusted mean); this was done specifically so par- 
ticipants would no longer meet 
the clinical criteria of 
HAND. Based on the Diminished SOP Theory (Salthouse, 
1996) and the Wickens Model of Information Processing 
(Wickens et al., 2013), SOP and attention are considered 
core cognitive abilities upon which other cognitive domains 
in these cognitive 
depend. Theoretically, 
domains may transfer to improvements in other cognitive 
domains, and possibly improvements in everyday function- 
ing. For instance, in a sample of 186 PWH, Fellows et al. 
(2014) found that SOP “fully mediated the effects of age on 
learning, memory, and executive functioning and partially 
mediated the effect of major depressive disorder on learning 
and memory” (p. 806). Participants’ performance on the 
everyday functioning measures and self-reported cognitive 
complaints were not used in making any determination of 
the cognitive domain chosen for training. 

In step two, if participants did not have impairments in 
either SOP or attention, they were assigned cognitive train- 
ing targeting their least compromised (but still 
impaired) 
cognitive domain (i.e., closest to a cut-off of 1 SD below the 
demographically-adjusted mean); this was done specifically 
so participants would no longer meet the clinical criteria of 
HAND. In step three, participants were assigned to play 
computerized modules that were selected specifically to 
improve performance in their individually selected targeted 
cognitive domains. We worked with participants to schedule 
times for them to complete their individual 
convenient 
training sessions at the research center. More information 
about the cognitive training modules for each domain, can 
be found at www.brainhq.com and in our protocol article 
(Vance et al., 2018). 



Using a treatment adherence checklist, the neuropsycho- 
logical testers monitored the amount of time participants 
engaged in cognitive training for both targeted cognitive 
domains. Also, the cognitive training software automatically 
monitors the amount of time participants spend engaged in 
each exercise. The correlation between the checklist and the 
software on time engaged in training was very high 
(r ¼ 0.935; p ¼ 0.001). To reduce participant burden, partici- 
pants could engage in two hours of training at a time to 
reduce the number of visits to the research center. Cognitive 
training was 
averaging 
1.66 hours/week of cognitive training. In their meta-analysis 
(2014) 
of 52 cognitive training studies, Lampit et al. 
observed optimal therapeutic effects occurred when training 
sessions are administered 1–3 times per week – dosage 
parameters observed in the TOPS Study. In regards to dos- 
age, we considered participants to be fully trained in each 
domain when they successfully completed 7 out of 10 hours 
of cognitive training, an approach similar to the seminal 
ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent 
and Vital Elderly) Study (N ¼ 2,802) (Ball et al., 2002). 
When examining the actual potential of the cognitive train- 
ing, such a completers-only analysis (n ¼ 41) is considered 
appropriate. We had participants (n ¼ 7) who did not com- 
their data were included in an intent-to- 
plete training; 
treat analysis. 

The sample size considerations for the study were based on 
feasibility and, as any pilot project (Leon et al., 2011), the 
study was not powered for formal statistical 
inference. 
Therefore, interpretation is based on in-sample measures of 
effect size and results are considered exploratory. To pro- 
duce fair comparisons between study groups across domains 
of cognitive training, the same cognitive training assignment 
algorithm was applied to participants in the control group 
to determine the training they would have received if they 
had been randomized to the individualized-training group 
and hypothetically assigned training (Imbens & Ruvin, 
2015). Analysis began by examining balance between study 
groups with respect to baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gen- 
der, race, HIV markers, etc.) using measures of effect size, 
such as Cohen’s d (small (cid:3)0.2, medium (cid:3)0.5, large (cid:3)0.8) 
and Cramer’s V (small (cid:3)0.1, medium (cid:3)0.3, large (cid:3)0.5, for 
cross-tabulations comparing two groups) 
(Cohen, 1988). 
Data from all randomized participants were included in the 


group comparisons, regardless of their level of participation 
in the study. Baseline characteristics were also examined for 
association with attrition from the study. Next, for each of 
the Everyday Functioning measures, descriptive statistics 
were tabulated at the pre- and post-intervention time-points 
by study group, and linear mixed-effects models with a ran- 
dom effect for subject were used to estimate the between- 
group difference in change from pre- to post-intervention, 
using a time-by-group interaction coefficient. Following an 
Intention-to-Treat approach, the models used all available 
data at each time-point, and conceptually relevant baseline 
characteristics associated with attrition were used as control- 
ling covariates (age, years of education, and alcohol use) in 
order 
from missing data 
(Groenwold et al., 2012). The variance components from 
each model were used to estimate a pooled standard devi- 
ation for each everyday functioning measure, which was 
then used to standardize the interaction coefficient and pro- 
vide a measure of effect size (Cohen’s d). The Satterthwaite 
approximation to degrees of freedom was used for signifi- 
cance tests of the interaction effect. Using baseline data of 
individuals screened for the study (N ¼ 135), Pearson 
all 
correlations between everyday functioning measures and 
cognitive domain scores were estimated and interpreted 
(small (cid:3)0.1, medium (cid:3)0.3, 
(Cohen, 1988). 
Analyses were conducted using R software version 4.0.3 (R 
Core Team, 2019).

the between-group standardized difference was 
reduced to d ¼ 0.26 (a small effect size). 

Using the ITT approach with posttest completers, Table 2 
presents descriptive statistics and measures of training effect 
on everyday functioning measures regardless of 
training 
received (or hypothetically assigned for control participants). 
A small beneficial effect was observed for the TIADL test (d 
¼ (cid:4)0.2) 
Simplified Medication Adherence 
Questionnaire (d ¼ 0.17). Effects for other measures ranged 
from no effect to trivial magnitude. 

Table 3 presents measures of training effect on everyday 
functioning measures, comparing participants trained in a 
specific domain vs. their respective matched control partici- 
pants. For the sake of parsimony, due to the number of 
comparisons, trivial or small effect findings were not dis- 
cussed, only small-to medium effects or larger are note- 
worthy. Compared to their control counterparts, participants 
who received SOP training showed small improvements on 
the Medication VAS (d ¼ 0.22) and the TIADL test (d ¼ 
(cid:4)0.17) (Table 3). 
Compared to their control counterparts, participants who 
received attention training showed small 
to medium 
improvements on the Lawton & Brody—BADL Complaints 
(i.e., reduced complaints) (d ¼ (cid:4)0.38) and the Lawton & 
Brody – IADL Complaints (d ¼ (cid:4)0.27) (Table 3). 
Compared to their control counterparts, participants who 
received verbal learning and memory training showed small 
to medium beneficial effects on the Simplified Medication 
Adherence Questionnaire (d ¼ 0.3) and the TIADL test (d ¼ 
(cid:4)0.28); however, they showed detrimental effects of small to 
medium magnitude on the Medication VAS (d ¼ (cid:4)0.29),

large improvements on the Medication VAS, the Simplified 
Medication Adherence Questionnaire, and the TIADL test 
(jdj ranging from 0.51 to 1.18); however, they also showed 
medium to large detrimental effects on the Lawton & 
Brody—BADL Complaints 
(d ¼ 0.6) and the Lawton &

medium to large detrimental effects on the Medication VAS 
(d ¼ (cid:4)1.06) and the Simplified Medication Adherence 
Questionnaire (d ¼ (cid:4)0.39) (Table 3). 


Compared to their control counterparts, participants who 
received spatial visualization training showed medium to 
large 
Simplified Medication

In terms of relevant differences found between participants 
who dropped from the study (n ¼ 21) and participants who 
provided a posttest assessment (Table 5), those who dropped 
from the study were more likely to be assigned to cognitive 
training (n ¼ 16, 76.2% vs. n ¼ 48, 54.5%, V ¼ 0.17); tended 
(M[SD] ¼ 54.2[6.97] vs. 50.9[4.7], d ¼ 0.5); 
to be older 
tended to have more years of education (M[SD] ¼ 12.4[2.2] 
vs. 11.4[2.6], d ¼ 0.46); tended to have slightly lower depres- 
sion symptoms (CESD: M[SD] ¼ 17.54[10.7] vs. 20.7[9.6], 
d ¼ 0.31); and tended to consume more alcohol (no. daily 
drinks: M[SD] ¼ 1.8 [0.9] vs. 1.3[0.6], d ¼ 0.61). The charac- 
teristics with the largest magnitude of association with drop- 
out (age, years of education, and alcohol use) were used as 
adjusting covariates in models estimating results shown on 
Tables 2 and 3. 

Overall, those who were assigned cognitive training experi- 
enced a small improvement on a speed-based everyday func- 
tioning task, the TIADL test, and the Simplified Medication 
Adherence Questionnaire compared to those who had no 
training. Yet, when examining specific types of cognitive 
domain training, some findings were consistent with those 
from previous studies, while others were inconsistent. As 
such it is important to dissect and compare these findings 
closely to the literature and results from the TOPS first aim 
article (Vance, et al., in press). Based upon Wickens Model 
of Information Processing and the Diminished SOP Theory 
discussed earlier, both SOP training and attention training 
were expected to exert the greatest cognitive benefits and 
translation to everyday functioning improvements; 
indeed 
we found that both domain training protocols produced 
such positive results. SOP training was associated with 
improvements in the performance-based TIADL test and a 
self-assessment of medication adherence (i.e., Medication 
Adherence VAS). These findings are consistent with previ- 
ous SOP training studies. Small improvement was observed 
for the TIADL performance test in prior studies (Edwards 
et al., 2005; Vance, Fazeli et al., 2012; Brien et al., 2013), 
while the small-to-medium improvement on medication 
adherence is a new finding, but not inconsistent with the 
pattern of 
improved efficiency in everyday functioning. 
Similarly, for attention training, small-medium improvement 
was observed on self-ratings of BADL and IADL complaints. 
Prior electrophysiological studies suggest that after such cog- 
nitive training, adults experience increased N200, N2c, and 
P3b amplitudes (O’Brien et al., 2013; Zendel et al., 2016). It 
is thought that both SOP and attention training uniquely 
reduce dependence on prefrontal regions (an area commonly 
susceptible to dysregulation in HIV; Melrose et al., 2008), 
therefore strengthening functional connectivity in executive 
function and visual attention in seronegative older adults 
(Ross et al., 2019) and reallocating such response to poster- 
ior brain regions. This reallocation of processing is thought 
to potentially reduce the need for top-down cognitive con- 
that can improve both attention and SOP in older 
trol 
improvements 
adults and translate to everyday functional 
(O’Brien et al., 2013). 
When examining the other cognitive training protocols, 
the results are mixed as detrimental effects were found for 
some everyday functioning outcomes. For example, detri- 
mental effects, varying in magnitude, were repeatedly found 
for subjective outcomes such as medication adherence and 
ADL outcomes across the other training protocols. Cautious 
interpretation is warranted for cognitive training protocols 
as sample size was profoundly smaller than the SOP and 
attention training, especially for executive function training. 
To make sense of these findings, it is important to con- 
sider two germane points. First, 
the implicit hypothesis 
underlying these cognitive training programs is that, cogni- 
tive training will improve cognitive ability in that domain 
which will then translate to improved everyday functioning. 
However, if there was a minimal amount of improvement in 
then those findings 
the cognitive domain after training, 
between cognitive training and everyday functioning out- 
comes should be censored, or at least interpreted with cau- 
tion. In our parent study article, large beneficial effects were 
observed for the SOP (d ¼ (cid:4)0.88), executive function (d ¼ 
(cid:4)0.89), and spatial 
learning and memory (d ¼ (cid:4) 0.71) 
domains. Medium to moderate beneficial effects were 
observed for attention (d ¼ (cid:4)0.45) and delayed spatial 
memory (d ¼ (cid:4)0.32). Trivial 
intervention effects were 
observed for verbal learning and memory (d ¼ 0.1) and spa- 
tial visualization (d ¼ (cid:4)0.06). A moderate detrimental effect 
was observed for the delayed verbal memory (d ¼ 0.35). 
Thus, by using a cutoff of d ¼ (cid:4)0.45 or higher effect size, 
only findings on SOP, attention, executive functioning, and 
spatial 
learning and memory training results on everyday 
functioning should be considered clinically meaningful. 
Second, only one of the measures of everyday functioning 
was performance-based (i.e., TIADL test) while all the others 
were self-reported, subjective measures of everyday function- 
ing. Perhaps these cognitive training protocols made people 
more sensitive or observant of how they were not perform- 
ing their everyday activities well. In that regard, some of 
these changes in perceptions of everyday functioning may be 
a result of the cognitive training, and the study itself focused 
on everyday functioning (i.e., Hawthorne effect), increasing 
the cognitive ability to be self-aware and overly or under 
sensitive of how they are negotiating their self-care and their 
environment, which might explain the various findings on 
subjective everyday functioning. 

Combined with the neuroAIDS and cognitive aging litera- 
implications for practice emerge. First, as 
tures, several 
many PWH age and experience cognitive impairments that 
can restrict 
their everyday functioning, growing evidence 
demonstrates that certain types of cognitive training, such as 
SOP training and executive training can improve function- 
ing in TIADLs as well as in driving and perhaps medication 
adherence (Vance, Fazeli, Cheatwood, et al., 2019). A caveat 
of this is that not all training protocols are the same. Some 
cognitive training produces more cognitive benefits than 
others, so the benefits may not be the same across all types 
of cognitive training (Vance et al., in press). Therefore, clin- 
ician recommendations to patients to engage in such cogni- 
clearly stating the 
tive 
advantages over some versions of cognitive training ver- 
sus others. 

Second, as PWH develop cognitive impairments including 
HAND, this can create a concern and anxiety. In TOPS, we 
informed participants of their HAND diagnosis and later 
reaction to this 
qualitatively assessed at posttest 



information (Vance, Jensen, et al., 2019). This qualitative 
analysis revealed several themes including Sadness, Anxiety, 
Unexpected, Concerned, Not Concerned/No Reaction; interest- 
ingly other themes emerged including Confirmation (self- 
revelation of having cognitive 
impairment), Knowledge 
Seeking, and Desire to Improve. Participants expressed fear 
about HAND but also wanted to know more about how to 
prevent or treat it; cognitive training may be an additional 
tool, 
in combination with other positive health behaviors 
such as physical exercise, to help address those concerns 
and fears. Nevertheless, cognitive training may help PWH 
assuage 
and everyday 
their 
functioning. 




From this study, several implications and future directions 
for research are posited. First, additional studies on the 
effects of cognitive training on everyday functioning should 
incorporate more measures of objective, performance-based 
everyday functioning such as the UCSD Performance-Based 
Skills Assessment Brief (UPSA-B (Moore et al., 2017), espe- 
cially measures that have more technology-related everyday 
tasks (i.e., internet used, computer skills) would be of value 
to modernize and extend the science (Vance et al., 2009). 
For example, although the TIADL test is a performance- 
based instrument and has been shown to be sensitive to cog- 
nitive training in some studies, some of the items in it may 
not be reflective of changes in modern everyday functioning. 
On the TIADL test task of looking up a phone number in a 
phone book, with proliferation of smart phones and other 
handheld devices and widespread internet connectivity, pho- 
nebooks are obsolete. In a study of 93 participants with 
PWH (43 with HAND) and 42 neurocognitive normal peo- 
ple without HIV, Woods et al. (2017) examined perform- 
ance on internet-based household IADLs such as internet 
shopping and banking. These researchers found that those 
with HAND experienced lower internet-based task scores 
and that such scores correlated with poorer motor skills, 
executive function, numeracy, and episodic memory. 

in addition to cognitive training to improve 
everyday functioning, training in everyday functioning skills 
may also be a more direct way of doing this for PWH. For 
example, in a sample of community-dwelling older adults, 
V 
R 
Czaja et al. (2020) used both SOP training (i.e., UFOV 
training) and a computer-based functional skills assessment 
training (CFSAT) program in older adults with and without 
cognitive impairments. Participants were assigned to either: 
(2) CFSAT plus SOP training. 
(1) CFSAT alone or 
Technological 
focus of CFSAT which 
the 
included ATM banking, online shopping, ticket kiosk, inter- 
acting with a pharmacy website, and internet IADLs. Using 
this training, researchers were able to improve everyday 
functioning in both groups; however, 29% in the CFSAT 
group achieved “mastery” while 32% those in the combined 
intervention achieved “mastery.” Interesting CFSAT also 
assesses such everyday functioning tasks and could be incor- 
porated into other studies. Incidentally, by learning such 



everyday skills, this in turn may improve cognitive abilities 
as it has also been observed in other studies that show that 
those who learn new skill (i.e., photography) experience 
improvements in memory and other cognitive domains 
(Vance et al., 2009). 
Third, this study provided unique insights suggesting that 
different cognitive training protocols may produce different 
therapeutic benefits on everyday functioning. In fact, a com- 
bination of various cognitive training protocols may yield 
the best therapeutic outcomes. In the TOPS study, 20 indi- 
vidualized combinations of training protocols were deliv- 
ered; regrettably, with such a small sample size, it prevents a 
meaningful comparison between training protocols. Future 
studies could incorporate a multiphase optimization strategy 
(MOST) design to determine which combination of training 
provides the most therapeutic benefit (Collins, 2018). The 
TOPS study provided a precursor to this approach, demon- 
strating that two cognitive training protocols can be admin- 
this 
istered simultaneously. By using the MOST design, 
approach could be conducted more systematically to exam- 
ine this. 

All studies have methodological strengths and limitation; 
this study is without exception. Four study strengths were 
noted. First, standardized norm-based neuropsychological 
measures were used to assess cognition and determine 
HAND, which assists with generalizing the findings across 
the literature. Second, a block randomization procedure was 
utilized to control for race and gender. Third, standardized 
cognitive training modules were employed. This ensured 
that participants received the exact training within the cog- 
nitive domain they were assigned. And, fourth, five meas- 
ures of subjective and/or objective everyday functioning 
were used. 
These strengths are related to some of the limitations 
observed in this study. First, although by no means exhaust- 
ive, the measures of everyday functioning represent a range 
in which to examine the impact of cognitive training on 
everyday functioning; there are clearly other more real world 
and current measures of everyday functioning that were not 
taken into consideration. Second, despite using standardized 
neuropsychological measures, no true cognitive domain tests 
exist. Although cognitive domain tests are carefully designed 
to minimized reliance on other cognitive domains to com- 
plete a test, even some minor cognitive function in other 
domains is recruited such that a cognitive measure is actu- 
ally measuring some aspect of other cognitive abilities (i.e., 
spillover effect). Third, and similarly, just as there is spill- 
over with cognitive tests, there is spillover with cognitive 
training in that there is no “pure” cognitive domain training. 
In fact, with the design of this study, the training effects are 
inter-related between particular cognitive domains depend- 
ing on which cognitive domains were trained in conjunction 
by each individual. Fourth, this was not a longitudinal study. 
Some of 
the changes from cognitive training may take 
months to emerge. Fifth, other variables of interest could 
have also impacted the cognitive training effect such as years 
with HIV (long-term survival), cognitive reserve, 
sleep 
these were not 
hygiene, and past/current substance use; 
accounted for in analyses. Finally, our sample expressed a 
high degree of depressive symptomatology which could have 
had an individual effect on each cognitive training protocol; 
unfortunately, with the small sample size, it was not feasible 
to look at the effect of this variable on each of the nine 
training conditions. 

In summary, this study was the first to administer a com- 
bination of cognitive training protocols in an individualized 
manner tailored to the participants’ cognitive performance 
with the goal of improving everyday functioning and reduc- 
ing HAND. Once the cognitive effect size of each sub-study 
was considered, it appears that some performance-based and 
subjective measures of everyday functioning were improved. 
Observing cognitive training effects in SOP, attention, and 
executive functioning specifically, a future cognitive protocol 
incorporating all three components may prove to be the 
most optimal combination to improve subjective and object- 
ive everyday functioning; in fact, the MOST protocol may 
be a novel way to investigate moving this science forward. 
Albeit, more research and consensus is needed to determine 
how to effectively measure everyday functioning, as current 
objective and subjective measures come with their own 
strengths and limitations that directly impact clinical prac- 
tice and effectiveness.
