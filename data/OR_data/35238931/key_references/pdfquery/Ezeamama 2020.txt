Abstract: The feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of computerized cognitive rehabilitation 
therapy (CCRT) for mitigating neurocognitive decline was evaluated in African adults ≥50 years old. 
Eighty-one Ugandans with (n = 40) and without (n = 41) chronic human immunodeﬁciency viruses 
(HIV) were allocated CCRT—i.e., 20–45-min cognitive training sessions with culturally adapted video 
games delivered via Captain’s Log Software, or standard of care (SOC). Pre and post (i.e., 8-weeks 
later) intervention performance based neurocognitive tests, quality of life (QOL) and frailty related 
phenotype (FRP) were determined in all respondents. Multivariable linear regression estimated 
CCRT- vs. SOC-related diﬀerences (β) in neurocognitive batteries, QOL and FRP. Eﬀect sizes (ES) 
for estimated β were calculated. CCRT protocol was completed by 92.8% of persons allocated to 
it. Regardless of HIV status, CCRT was associated with higher performance in learning tests than 
SOC—interference list (β = 1.00, 95%CI: (0.02, 1.98); ES = 0.43) and delayed recall (β = 1.04, 95%CI: 
(0.06, 2.02); ES = 0.47). CCRT eﬀect on verbal ﬂuency was clinically important (ES = 0.38), but statistical 
signiﬁcance was not reached (β = 1.25, 95%CI: (−0.09, 2.58)). Among HIV-positive adults, clinically 
important post-CCRT improvements were noted for immediate recall (ES = 0.69), working memory 
(ES = 0.51), verbal ﬂuency (ES = 0.51), and timed gait (ES = −0.44) tasks. Among HIV-negative adults, 
CCRT resulted in moderate post-intervention improvement in learning tests (ES = 0.45) and large 
decline in FRP (ES = −0.71), without a positive eﬀect on simple attention and visuomotor coordination 
tasks. CCRT intervention is feasible among older Ugandan adults with potential beneﬁt for learning 
and verbal ﬂuency tests regardless of HIV status and lowering FRP in HIV-negative older adults.

Demographic and epidemiologic transitions have expanded the population of older individuals, [1] 
and neurocognitive dysfunction/impairment has become a public health problem worldwide. 
These transitions combine with forces of globalization and changes in nutrition to increase the risk 
of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) [2] such as type II diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular 
diseases [3] in many Sub-Saharan African countries. In Uganda, the rise in NCD in the general 
population has been characterized as severe [4]. NCDs are often accompanied by metabolic 
dysregulations and frailty, i.e., vulnerability due to decline in function across multiple physiologic 
systems, which constitute independent risk factors for age-related neurocognitive dysfunction, disability 
and low quality of life (QOL) [4–7]. 
Age-related changes are seen in executive activities involving working memory, attention, 
task switching, and motor response speed [8]. These cognitive/behavioral changes with aging are 
matched with neuroanatomical changes, including reduced volume of gray matter in the brain; 
progressive thinning out of the cerebral cortex, particularly in the frontal lobes; lower levels of 
dopamine and serotonin neurotransmitters; and lower binding potential of neurotransmitters to 
respective receptors [8]. Older adults living with human immunodeﬁciency viruses (HIV) infection are 
at especially high risk of premature neurocognitive decline, frailty and low QOL. Aging and NCD-related 
risk factors synergize with virus-mediated neuroinﬂammation [9] and HIV-treatment-related side-eﬀects 
such heart disease [10] to advance the time to onset of various aspects of aging-related neurocognitive 
dysfunction, frailty and low QOL [11]. One functional consequence of these outcomes is that complex 
tasks, such as cooking, are the ﬁrst areas aﬀected, followed by the ability to execute instrumental 
activities of daily living, as neurocognitive decline and frailty worsen [11]. 
There are no known eﬀective treatments to mitigate aging or HIV-associated premature 
neurocognitive decline. However, it has been shown that when the brain is exposed to challenging 
and stimulating tasks, it will grow (like neurogenesis in hippocampus), while deprivation results in 
shrinkage of the brain regardless of age [12]. Hence, tasks that incorporate elements of newness and 
challenge have the potential to maintain or improve neurocognitive performance and increase QOL 
in vulnerable populations [12]. Recent research suggests that cognitive stimulation programs in the 
form of diﬀerent activities that are geared towards memory, attention, gnosis, and executive functions, 
when completed for 24 weeks by HIV aﬀected individuals, result in better neuropsychological test 
performance, even when adjusted for age, gender, education, and race [10]. Our group [13,14] and 
others [10,15–17] have adapted CCRT programs for computer delivery in the form of simple game-like 
programs that can be used by lay individuals on a laptop or tablet with minimal training. This potential 
utility of computerized cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CCRT) for improving aspects of neurocognitive 
function recently has been demonstrated for African children with cerebral malaria [18–21] and in 
several Western studies, including older adults enrolled in the multi-center trial, Advanced Cognitive 
Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE) trial [22], adults with heart disease [23,24], 
and adults subjected to prolonged bed-rest [13,14]. However, the feasibility of CCRT intervention 
for mitigating aging and HIV-associated neurocognitive decline in the African setting is unknown. 
Hence, in this study, we evaluated feasibility of a culturally adapted CCRT intervention among older 
Ugandans with and without HIV-infection. Further, this study assesses the preliminary eﬃcacy of a 
CCRT intervention via eﬀect sizes for improvement in neurocognitive outcomes (primary outcome), 
QOL and reduction in frailty-related phenotype (secondary outcomes) among older adults with and 
without chronic HIV infection. We further explore the variations in CCRT feasibility and beneﬁt by 
HIV status. 




This is a non-randomized trial of CCRT vs. standard of care (SOC, i.e., no CCRT) in older HIV-positive 
patients connected to HIV care at Mildmay Uganda Hospital and HIV-negative community controls 
who were matched to HIV-positive adults by age (±5 years), sex and village of residence. Consenting 
eligible participants were allocated on a ﬁrst-come-ﬁrst-served basis to CCRT intervention or SOC in 
alternating blocks of eight participants of same HIV status till target sample size was attained. 

The feasibility trial was conducted at Mildmay Uganda Hospital—a tertiary comprehensive health 
center that provides care and treatment for HIV-infected persons as its primary function. At the time of 
study initiation, Mildmay Clinic provided care for an estimated 15,300 HIV-infected adults, of whom 
15,200 were on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART). 

Participants were enrolled between July 2017 and April 2018. HIV-infected adults were recruited 
from the study hospital and matched to HIV-negative community controls by age, sex and village of 
residence. Due to staﬃng and space constraints combined with the need to preserve conﬁdentially of 
HIV-positive individuals, allocation to cognitive training was done in blocks by HIV status. A maximum 
of eight individuals could be cognitively trained at any one time. Hence, the ﬁrst 16 individuals were 
identiﬁed and the ﬁrst eight that consented to multiple study visits for the purpose of implementing the 
CCRT protocol were allocated to CCRT arm. The remaining eight individuals were allocated to SOC 
arm. The second block of enrollees were demographically matched HIV-negative controls allocated to 
either CCRT or SOC in the same manner as described for HIV-positive adults. 

Eligibility criteria included: (a) men or women aged ≥50 years old, (b) if HIV+ must be connected 
to HIV care at the Mildmay Uganda Hospital, (c) must reside within 25 km of the hospital, and (d) if 
HIV-negative, must consent to HIV-testing at enrolment. All participants provided written informed 
consent for study participation and were willing to return for implementation of the CCRT protocol 
if allocated CCRT. Subjects who were very ill or physically disabled and thus unable to undergo 
performance-based assessments were excluded. 

Participants in the CCRT intervention arm received 20–45-min sessions of cognitive training on 
laptop computers with culturally adapted video games through Captain’s Log Software delivered 
2 days per week (two training sessions per day) over a minimum of 5 weeks. All participants wore 
sound-deadening headphones and sat far enough apart from one another to avoid being distracted 
by other participants training at the same time. Research assistants proﬁcient in the local language, 
Luganda, supervised CCRT and provided instructions or guidance as needed. CCRT intervention 
consisted of two components—culturally adapted Brain Powered Games—Uganda (BPG-U, 20 min) 
and Spatial Navigation Training (SNT, 25 min). Participants in the SOC arm were not cognitively 
trained, but had neuropsychological, QOL and frailty tests on the same schedule as the CCRT group. 
At all times during this trial, HIV-positive participants continued to receive standard medical 
care according to Uganda’s Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines. In brief, HIV-positive adults are 
initially assigned to the ﬁrst line three drug combination highly active antiretroviral therapy. Typically, 
the ﬁrst line cocktail includes: Abacavir or zidovudine (AZT) or tenofovir (TDF) + lamivudine (3TC) + 
efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP). In case of treatment failure or drug toxicity, patients that were on 


abacavir or TDF are assigned to AZT + 3TC plus a protease inhibitor which could be Atazanavir or 
lopinaviar boosted with ritonavir. All HIV+ persons are maintained on cotrimoxazole prophylaxis or 
dapsone for life and strongly encouraged to consistently sleep under insecticide-treated mosquito nets 
to limit the risk of malaria. In the absence of a system of preventive primary health care in Uganda, 
most “healthy” HIV-negative individuals are not connected to routine care unless they are ill. Thus, 
usual study-related medical care for HIV-negative participants included referral to the national referral 
hospital for further management in case they develop clinical signs/symptoms. This is consistent with 
the standard practice in the Uganda health system. 

At baseline only, we administered a detailed background information questionnaire to obtain socio- 
demographic data, including age, parity, education, residence, employment status, socio-economic 
status variables, marital status, and past/current use of tobacco, alcohol, and other substances. 
The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale was used to assess depressive symptoms [25]. 
Psychosocial adversity was measured as acute (within 30 days), recent (within 5 years) and as a lifetime 
cumulative adversity, using the perceived stress scale and recent and lifetime adversity questionnaires 
adapted and translated for the study setting [26]. Blood samples were collected from each participant 
at enrollment to measure CD4 counts, complete blood counts (CBCs), bilirubin, creatinine, and alanine 
transferase, as part of clinical standard of care for all patients. In addition, lipids proﬁle testing 
(high density lipoproteins (HDL), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides) was done per 
standard protocol. 

Feasibility of the CCRT intervention was assessed by (a) percent of participants completing 
CCRT sessions among those allocated in the intervention and (b) percent of those allocated CCRT that 
completed the study protocol in a timely manner (8 weeks). Preliminary eﬃcacy was assessed with 
respect to (a) performance-based neurocognitive tests (primary outcome), (b) QOL and frailty-related 
phenotype (FRP) (secondary outcomes). Outcome measures described below were evaluated twice—at 
study enrollment and again at week 6 following CCRT training or equivalent time period for the 
SOC group. 

Feasibility/acceptability of intervention was primarily evaluated as overall and HIV-status speciﬁc 
rate of study protocol completion (i.e., pre-intervention neuropsychological test, 20 CCRT sessions 
and post-intervention neuropsychological testing). A second measure of feasibility, timely completion, 
is deﬁned to estimate number of adult participants that completed the study protocol within 8 weeks 
of enrolment. 

Cognitive performance was assessed by performance on a set of standardized paper-and-pencil 
tests previously shown to be culturally-independent and sensitive for detecting HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and HIV dementia (HAD) in HIV+ patients in Uganda by members 
of our team [27]. All the tests have had their instructions and content translated into Luganda—the local 
language, which was used to present all test measures. Tests were scored according to manufacturer’s 
instructions and were analyzed as continuous outcome variables. The cognitive assessment battery 
included nine separate tests covering several cognitive domains, as described below: 







Fine motor function—evaluated using two tests: (i) Finger Tapping (number of taps within 10 s) 
and (ii) the Grooved Pegboard Test, which measures the amount of time (in seconds) it takes to 
place 25 slotted pegs into rows of randomly positioned slots on a board. 
Executive function—measured using Color Trails2 test (time to completion of a complex task 
requiring attention to two aspects of problem solving simultaneously) and verbal (semantic) 
ﬂuency (number correct animals named within 60 s) to quantify proﬁciency in completing tasks 
that require planning, organizing, prioritizing, focus/attention, multi-tasking, and inhibition of 
irrational impulses. 
Speed of Processing—measures how long it takes individuals to complete a cognitive visual 
scanning and simple sequencing task using Color Trails 1 (time (in seconds) to task completion) 
and Digit Symbol test in which participants are asked to draw in small symbols in spaces under 
numbers corresponding to number/symbol pairs at the top of the test sheet (number correct 
matches within 90 s). 





QOL was measured using the short form Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire. Individual scores 
for general health perceptions, physical functioning, pain, vitality, role functioning, social functioning, 
and mental health were computed. An overall QOL score was derived by summing these components 
and scaling total score to a theoretical maximum of 100. 

FRP is a clinical state of increased vulnerability resulting from aging associated decline in multiple 
physiologic systems. It was deﬁned using the Edmonton frail scale to measure functional vulnerability 
in the following domains: cognition, general health status, functional independence, medication use, 
continence, functional performance, social support, and unintentional weight loss. An overall FRP 
score is the sum of respective domains and analyzed as a continuous outcome variable. 

Statistical power: In light of the feasibility pilot nature of this intervention and absence of formal 
a priori hypotheses, speciﬁc power calculation was not applicable. Estimates of the eﬀect sizes from 
the present study will inform power analyses for future more deﬁnitive investigation. 
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive analyses by intervention arm and HIV status summarized the 
distributions of outcomes and potential covariates. To assess feasibility of CCRT intervention, the rates 
of protocol completion overall and according to HIV status were determined. Multivariable general 
linear models were used to estimate CCRT vs. SOC-related diﬀerences (β coeﬃcients) in neurocognitive 
batteries, QOL, and FRP. The dependent variables in these models were primary/secondary outcome 
measures at week 8 (one at a time), and covariates included baseline version of the outcome, number 
of non-HIV comorbid conditions, age, sex, level of education, intervention group (CCRT vs. SOC), 
and HIV status. The coeﬃcients for the intervention group variable (β) and their 95% conﬁdence 
intervals (CIs) provided estimates of the intervention eﬀects. In addition, eﬀect sizes were calculated 
as diﬀerences between group means in the adjusted standard deviation units (square root of the mean 
squared error) to quantify clinical relevance of estimated βs and inform planning of future studies. 
Eﬀect sizes of 0.5 or a larger are ubiquitously universal for deﬁnition of clinical importance, [28] and 
eﬀect sizes of 0.33 or greater are often deemed clinically important as well [29]. All analyses were 
implemented in SAS v.9.4. To explore diﬀerences in CCRT eﬀects according to HIV status; intervention 


group by HIV status interaction was added to the models; and estimates of the CCRT eﬀects (β’s, 
95% CIs, eﬀect sizes) were obtained by HIV status. 

This project was ethically reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of Michigan 
State University, (Protocol #17-205) and Makerere University Research Ethics Committee (MUREC, 
protocol #: REC REF 0403-2017). In addition to these approvals, the implementation of this study 
protocol was further approved by the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology (Permit #: 
HS 2275). 


Male and female Ugandans between 50 and 87 years of age were enrolled. The sample included 
54.6% female (n = 44) and by design equal number of HIV-infected (n = 40, mean age = 57.9 (SD (standard 
deviation) = 7) years) and age (±5 years), sex and village of residence-matched HIV-negative community 
controls (n = 40, mean age = 61.8 (SD = 7) years). All HIV+ adults currently received primary health 
care at Mildmay Hospital. Participants allocated CCRT vs. SOC had similar distributions of matching 
factors (age, sex, village of residence), as well years of education, prevalence of non-HIV comorbid 
diseases, duration of HIV disease, psychosocial stress, immune factors, and baseline performance in all 
neuropsychological test batteries (Table 1).

The median duration on cART among HIV+ adults was 10 years with a range of 1 to 18 years. 
Mean CD4 cell count was 564 (SD = 319) cells per microliter, and 57.5% (n = 23) were virologically 
suppressed. Lipid proﬁle tests, educational level and prevalence of non-HIV comorbid conditions 
were similar across HIV groups. Average performance on WHO UCLA learning tests were similar 
across HIV groups. However, average performance in ﬁnger tapping, timed gait, score digit and 
grooved pegboard tests were higher for HIV-negative community controls relative to HIV+ older 
Ugandans (Table 2).

Overall Sample: Eﬀect of CCRT on neurocognitive performance, QOL and frailty 
Adjusted for baseline value of respective outcomes, non-HIV comorbid disease, HIV status, age, 
sex, and educational attainment; older adults that received CCRT had higher average post-intervention 
scores of clinical importance in tests verbal ﬂuency (β = 1.25, 95%CI: −0.09 to 2.58, ES = 0.38); and the 
following subscales of the WHO UCLA tests of learning: interference list recall (β = 1.00, 95% CI: 
0.02–1.98; ES = 0.43) and delayed recall (β = 1.04, 95%CI: 0.06–2.02; ES = 0.47) relative to peers allocated 
no CCRT intervention. However, time to completion of motor speed/hand-eye coordination tasks was 
modestly elevated for participants that received CCRT vs. no CCRT (grooved peg-board dominant 
hand: β = 0.21, 95%CI: −0.07, 0.50; ES = 0.32). All other CCRT-related diﬀerences in neurocognitive 
outcomes were statistically insigniﬁcant and of only small or modest clinical signiﬁcance. There was 
no association between CCRT and post-intervention quality of life (β = −2.64, 95%CI: −6.7 to 1.4; 
ES = −0.28) and frailty-related phenotype (β = −0.12, 95%CI: −0.74 to 0.50; ES = −0.09) (Table 3). 

Among HIV+ older adults, CCRT intervention resulted in post-intervention score improvement 
of large clinical importance in the areas of immediate recall (β = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.08–1.73; ES = 0.69), 
digit span backwards (β = 0.79, 95%CI: −0.18–1.77; ES = 0.51) and verbal ﬂuency (β = 1.68, 95%CI: 
−0.32–3.67; ES = 0.51). Also among HIV+ older adults, the receipt of CCRT intervention resulted in 
higher scores of clinical importance in post-intervention delayed recall (ES: 0.41 to 0.44, p = 0.168 to 
0.202) and ﬁnger tapping (ES = 0.38, p = 0.233) tests as well as faster time to completion of color trails 
(ES = −0.32, p = 0.306) and timed gait (ES = −0.44, p = 0.167) tasks. 
Among HIV-negative demographically-matched controls, CCRT intervention on the one hand 
resulted in FRP declines of large clinical importance (β = −0.54, 95%CI: −1.00 to −0.08; ES = −0.71) 
and improvement in WHO UCLA learning tests for subscales of interference (ES = 0.45, p = 0.129) 
and delayed recall (ES = 0.45, p = 0.135) of clinical importance. On the other hand, receipt of CCRT 
intervention was associated with lower performance in digit span forward test (ES = −0.44, p = 0.147) 
and longer time to completion of grooved pegboard task (ES = 0.41, p = 0.172) among HIV negative 
community controls that received CCRT vs. no intervention (Table 4).

Estimates shown are age, sex, education and baseline score adjusted for each outcome measure in separate linear 
regression models. Measures of association (eﬀect size and p-value for test of mean diﬀerences by intervention group) 
are shown for overall sample (regardless of HIV-status). Statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences and diﬀerences with 
corresponding eﬀect size >|0.30| are bolded. Given the small sample size, we interpret potential clinical relevance 
using a combination of statistical signiﬁcance and diﬀerences in ES of |0.3| which corresponds to at least a moderate 
eﬀect per literature on patient-reported outcomes. ES diﬀerences of ≤|0.2| are considered ‘small’. # = number.

Estimates shown are age, sex, education, and baseline score adjusted for each outcome (bolded) in separate linear regression models. Measures of association (eﬀect size and p-value for 
test of mean diﬀerences by intervention group) are shown for overall sample (regardless of HIV-status) and within HIV-status groups. Within HIV groups, adjusted least-square means and 
SE for respective tests are shown for CCRT vs. no CCRT groups. Statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences and diﬀerences with corresponding eﬀect size >|0.30| are bolded Given small sample 
size, we interpret potential clinical relevance using a combination of statistical signiﬁcance and diﬀerences in ES of |0.30| which corresponds to at least moderate eﬀect per literature on 
patient reported outcomes. ES diﬀerences of < = |0.2| are considered ‘small’. QOL = Quality of Life, # = Number. 



With more than 90% of individuals assigned to CCRT completing the study protocol, and over 
70% doing so within 8 weeks of enrolment, we concluded that the CCRT intervention is feasible 
among Ugandan adults 50 years and above. Although overall completion rate was similar by HIV 
status, timely protocol completion was lower among HIV-infected adults suggesting that future studies 
will need to increase eﬀorts to encourage timely return for cognitive training among HIV-infected 
adults or potentially develop more local administration options. Overall ﬁndings suggest the potential 
utility of CCRT for mitigating HIV-and aging-related neurocognitive impairment in Ugandan adults 
50 years and above. Given our sample size and the feasibility intent of this investigation, we interpret 
potential clinical relevance using a combination of statistical signiﬁcance and diﬀerences in ES of ≥|0.33|, 
which corresponds to the diﬀerence of at least moderate clinical importance as per literature on patient 
reported outcomes [30–32]. The potential eﬃcacy of CCRT-intervention reported here is similar to 
previous observations among patients with early Alzheimer’s Disease [33]. 
Study results show that regardless of HIV status, older adults who participated in CCRT showed 
improvements of at least modest clinical importance in tests of executive function (verbal ﬂuency) 
and verbal learning/memory (interference list and delayed recall) relative to the control group. 
These preliminary ﬁndings of neurocognitive beneﬁts of modest clinical importance in some cognitive 
domains are consistent with previous reports of CCRT-related neurocognitive beneﬁt in healthy 
older individuals [34], older adults with HIV infection [35–38], and older individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment [39]. Speciﬁcally, among healthy older Americans (mean age = 69, SD = 6.9), 
CCRT targeting auditory perception and visuomotor/working memory domains of cognition was 
associated with post-training improvements in tests of everyday problem solving, working memory 
and matrix reasoning [34]. Our observations that CCRT improved post interference and delayed 
recall in older Ugandans is similar to previously reported cognitive training-related improvement in 
episodic recall and recognition in HIV-negative French individuals with mild cognitive impairment [39], 
and with improvement in tests of processing speed and time to completion of instrumental activities 
of daily living, in a small sample of HIV-infected American adults 40 years or older [35]. Hence, 
emerging data from the present study and others, including a recent meta-analysis of 12 studies in 
patients with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline [40], are in support of the 
thesis that CCRT in populations at high risk of aging- and HIV-related neurocognitive dysfunction 
stimulates neuroplasticity that can build new and stronger connections between neurons and translate 
to measurable improvements observed in some neurocognitive domains [41]. However, not all studies 
have found CCRT-related neurocognitive beneﬁts, including a previously reported observation of no 
cognitive performance beneﬁt of a computer-based cognitive exercise program on age-related cognitive 
decline among American seniors [42]. 
We found more consistent and broader neurocognitive beneﬁt of CCRT vs. no CCRT training among 
HIV-positive older Ugandans with clinically moderate or large cognitively beneﬁcial eﬀects noted in 
the areas of verbal learning/memory (immediate and delayed recall tests), short-term working memory 
(digit span backwards), executive function (verbal ﬂuency), psychomotor function (ﬁnger tapping, 
timed gait), and processing speed (i.e., color trails). Of note, at enrolment, HIV-infected older adults had 
a broader scope of neurocognitive disadvantage relative to demographically-matched HIV-negative 
community controls with worse performance in motor function (Timed gait, ﬁnger tapping, dominant 
hand grooved pegboard), simple attention (digit span forward) and short-term verbal memory 
(digit span backward) tests. Hence, a larger beneﬁt of CCRT intervention in HIV-infected older adult 
partly reﬂects the greater burden of neurocognitive impairment (and thus opportunity for CCRT-related 
remediation) in this group [43,44]. This position is supported by Kaur et al.’s observation that the 
largest post CCRT neurocognitive beneﬁt in their sample occurred in HIV-positive adults that had 
the lowest baseline neurocognitive performance, higher viral load, poorer medication adherence, 
and the greatest number of years lived with HIV infection [45]. In spite of these hypotheses conﬁrming 
association between CCRT and neurocognitive function among HIV-infected adults, in contrast with 


our study hypothesis, there was no evidence that CCRT intervention was beneﬁcial for quality of life 
or FRP reduction among older adults living with HIV. 
Among HIV-negative older adults, a large hypothesis conﬁrming CCRT-related decline in FRP was 
observed although CCRT was unrelated to improvement in QOL. In fact, CCRT intervention-related 
neurocognitive beneﬁt among HIV-negative older adults was relatively inconsistent and occurred 
in fewer cognitive domains compared to HIV-infected peers. The CCRT related reduction in frailty 
aligns with the observation that cognitive training in older patients with mild cognitive impairment 
was associated with modest improvements in self-rated QOL, activities of daily living and functional 
ability [46]. With respect to post-intervention cognitive scores, the CCRT-related moderate improvement 
observed in learning and memory tests among HIV-negative community controls was inconsistent 
with moderately worse scores in tests of simple attention and worse performance in test of hand-eye 
coordination/manual dexterity (grooved pegboard) observed in the same older adults that received 
CCRT vs. SOC. Future studies with larger sample size will be needed to clarify these ﬁndings. 
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst evaluation of the feasibility and promise of CCRT for mitigating 
aging and HIV-associated neurocognitive decline and for reducing FRP in Ugandan adults over 50 years 
old. Cultural adaptation of the CCRT intervention, utilization of open-source technology platform, 
and inclusion of HIV-positive and HIV-negative older Ugandans matched on key demographic factors 
are important strengths in this feasibility study. The fact that CCRT and SOC arms were similar at 
baseline with respect to several demographic covariates and pre-test neuropsychological performance, 
and attrition was low by study end, are additional strengths. However, this study is subject to the 
three limitations that should be considered in the interpretation of this study and in the design of 
deﬁnitive future studies: (a) CCRT intervention was not randomly allocated, limiting our ability to 
exclude confounding by unmeasured covariate; (b) post-test intervention duration was relatively short, 
excluding the ability to test for stability of observed associations, and (c) repeat neuropsychological 
testing did not use a parallel version of respective tools, raising the potential for learning eﬀect upon 
repeat testing. These results are promising and suggests larger investigations are warranted to formally 
test the eﬃcacy of CCRT for mitigation of premature neurocognitive decline, high risk of frailty and 
low quality of life in this vulnerable population. 

Preliminary data from this feasibility study suggest that CCRT may be a promising non-pharmacologic 
intervention for mitigating neurocognitive decline and aging-related disability in older Africans, 
especially those with HIV infection. These ﬁndings underscore the need for prospectively powered 
clinical trials to test the eﬃcacy of this intervention and the corresponding duration of any CCRT-related 
neuroprotective eﬀects. 
If these preliminary ﬁndings are supported by more deﬁnitive studies, 
then CCRT represents a potentially eﬀective yet aﬀordable strategy for making a community-wide 
impact on a growing public health problem in SSA and beyond.
