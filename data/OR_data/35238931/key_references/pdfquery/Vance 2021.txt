Abstract 
Half of people with HIV (PWH) have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). This study examined whether 
cognition can be improved using a framework targeting impaired individual cognitive domains in PWH with HAND. In this 
two-group pre-post experimental design study, 88 adults with HAND were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact control 
group (n = 40) or (2) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group (n = 48). Baseline cognitive performance was 
assessed on eight cognitive domains. A theoretical framework was used to determine the two cognitive domains selected for 
training. With priority on speed of processing (SOP) and attention impairments, participants received SOP and/or attention 
training if such impairments were detected; if not, participants were assigned to cognitive training in one/two of the least 
impaired cognitive domains contributing to their HAND diagnosis. Global cognitive score was slightly improved follow- 
ing training (p = 0.256; d = − 0.21), but it was not significant. Significant improvements were observed on SOP following 
training in that domain (SOP; d = − 0.88; p = 0.011). SOP training also improved functioning in other cognitive domains. 
This individualized cognitive intervention did not change HAND status, but it did result in improved SOP, in turn yielding 
improvement in other cognitive domains.

In 2018, nearly 51% of people with HIV (PWH) in the U.S. 
and dependent areas were aged 50 and older [1]; by 2030 
this number is expected to increase to 70% [2].

Combined with the effects of cognitive aging, the inci- 
dence and severity of such cognitive impairments, often 
referred to as HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder 
(HAND), is expected to increase as people age with HIV [3, 
4]. Such cognitive impairments can impair everyday func- 
tioning (i.e., driving safely, medication adherence, financial 
management) and quality of life (i.e., cognitive complaints, 
depressive symptomatology, poor locus of control) [5]. As 
such, HAND can decrease autonomy and increase the need 
for caregiving support [6]. 

A diagnosis of HAND is established using a neuropsycho- 
logical algorithm called the Frascati criteria [7]. Developed 
by a team of neuroAIDS experts, these criteria require the 
use of norm-based (age/education) cognitive performance 
measures in five or more cognitive domains. HAND is diag- 
nosed when a person performs more than 1 SD below his/ 
her demographically adjusted mean in two or more cognitive 



 
domains (e.g., executive function, memory) [8]. (For more 
details regarding nuances of the HAND diagnosis see Black- 
stone et al. [9]). As such, it is common for PWH to meet 
the criteria for HAND by only a fraction of a SD. If there 
are interventions that can improve cognitive functioning by 
such a fraction, it is possible to reduce the incidence of the 
HAND diagnosis. This finding would represent a shift in 
the way we consider HAND, removing its stigma as a static 
“progressive” diagnosis to something that can be modified 
and treated. Indeed, studies suggest HAND has a variable 
course, as compared to more degenerative conditions such 
as Alzheimer’s disease [10]. 

Fortunately, cognitive training programs resulting in small- 
to-moderate cognitive improvements, perhaps by only a 
fraction of a SD, may sufficiently improve performance in 
an individual’s critical cognitive domain(s). In a systematic 
review of 13 studies on cognitive training programs in PWH, 
Vance and colleagues found that, in general, cognitive train- 
ing successfully improved cognition in the domain that was 
targeted for training [11]. For example, Vance, Fazeli, Ross, 
Wadley, and Ball [12] randomized a sample of 46 adults 
living with HIV to either: (1) a no-contact control group, 
or (2) a speed of processing (SOP) training group. Those in 
the SOP training group received 10 h of computerized exer- 
cises specifically designed to improve the ability to quickly 
process visual stimuli. This study demonstrated that SOP 
training was effective as measured by the Useful Field of 
View test, a cognitive test of visual SOP and visual attention 
(p = 0.04, power = 0.53). In addition, the training improved 
everyday functioning as measured by the Timed Instru- 
mental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) test (p = 0.03, 
power = 0.59). 
Yet, with the relatively few studies, generally under- 
powered due to small sample sizes, of cognitive training 
in PWH, the clinical utility of recommending and adminis- 
tering cognitive training in this clinical population remains 
unclear. Fortunately, studies in older adults without HIV pro- 
vide additional insights. In a meta-analysis of 52 cognitive 
training studies using a variety of computer-based cognitive 
training protocols (in one or multiple cognitive domains) 
conducted with community-dwelling older adults aged 
60–82 years old, Lampit and colleagues [13] determined that 
the average cognitive improvement after cognitive training 
was 0.22 standard deviations (SD). Upon closer examination, 
these researchers found significant cognitive improvement 
across various domains including SOP (g = 0.31), visuospa- 
tial skills (g = 0.30), nonverbal memory (g = 0.24), working 
memory (g = 0.22), and verbal memory (g = 0.08). Although 
these training gains are expressed in small-to-moderate 
effect sizes, based on how HAND is operationalized, such 

cognitive improvement after training may be enough to 
change this classification. 

Although we may be able to improve function in specific 
cognitive domains via cognitive training, such training 
often requires 10–20 h of intense engagement per cognitive 
domain [13]. Many with HAND experience impairments in 
numerous cognitive domains [4]; thus, the time required to 
engage in cognitive training to improve all impaired domains 
could be significant (e.g., 100 h), which represents signifi- 
cant burden and likely would result in non-adherence. A 
strategy to allocate such cognitive training to a smaller num- 
ber of domains may reduce such burden, facilitate adher- 
ence, and improve cognition. 
To address this dilemma, such a strategy was created 
called the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training 
Framework [14]. This framework posits that in order to not 
over burden the participant, cognitive training should target 
the individual’s impairments in SOP and attention first, if 
any impairments in these two domains are detected for the 
participant. Otherwise, cognitive training should focus on 
the domains that are least impaired but still contribute to the 
HAND diagnosis. Thus, only two cognitive domains should 
be targeted for training (10 h of training for each cognitive 
domain). This framework is based on the Diminished SOP 
Theory [15] and the Wickens Model of Information Pro- 
cessing [16], as well as evidence from the cognitive aging 
literature, which demonstrate that improvements in SOP and 
attention are core cognitive abilities that support all other 
cognitive domains. For example, in a sample of 186 PWH, 
Fellows, Byrd, and Morgello [17] observed that SOP “fully 
mediated the effects of age on learning, memory, and execu- 
tive functioning and partially mediated the effect of major 
depressive disorder on learning and memory” (p. 806). Thus, 
improvement in these cognitive domains theoretically can 
transfer to improvement in other cognitive domains. (Details 
of the framework are described in the Methods section.) 

Based on this literature and the Individualized-Targeted Cog- 
nitive Training Framework just described, this study posed 
two aims. Aim 1 was to test the hypothesis that a person- 
centered cognitive training intervention targeting impaired 
individual cognitive domains can reduce the incidence of 
individuals meeting the criteria for HAND in PWH age 40 
and older. Aim 2 was to explore whether targeted cognitive 
training would produce cognitive benefits on global and indi- 
vidual cognitive functioning scores. 

 



The Training on Purpose Study (TOPS) examined an 
Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training Framework, 
an algorithm to allocate domain-specific cognitive training 
to address each participants’ unique pattern of cognitive 
impairment as determined during the baseline assessment. 
This framework was designed to decrease the severity and 
incidence of cognitive impairment in certain domains, and 
thus possibly reduce the severity and incidence of HAND. 
In this two-group pre/post experimental design, partici- 
pants were recruited from a university HIV/AIDS clinic 
and were administered a comprehensive battery of cogni- 
tive and psychosocial measures at baseline. Those who 
met the diagnostic criteria of HAND were randomized to 
either: (1) a no-contact control group, or (2) an Individ- 
ualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group. Participation 
in the no-contact control group was limited to the base- 
line assessment, and then the posttest assessment approxi- 
mately 12 weeks later. Those in the experimental group 
engaged in 20 h of cognitive training programs targeting 
two cognitive domains, with ten hours targeting one cog- 
nitive domain and ten hours targeting another cognitive 
domain in which impairments were detected at baseline. 
Again, the framework was used to determine which spe- 
cific cognitive training programs each participant received 
based on his/her baseline cognitive performance. After 
cognitive training was completed approximately 12 weeks 
later, these experimental participants were administered 
the posttest assessment. Ethical approval for this study was 
granted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s 
Institutional Review Board. 

As can be seen from the Consort Figure (Fig. 1), potential 
participants were recruited from flyers posted at an HIV/ 
AIDS clinic, AIDS service organizations, local churches, 
and public businesses (e.g., laundromats). Those inter- 
ested called a phone number listed on the flyer and were 
screened over the telephone to determine eligibility. Inclu- 
sion criteria included: (a) diagnosed with HIV for at least 
1 year; (b) 40 years of age or older; (c) free from any 
severe neuromedical condition (e.g., schizophrenia, Alz- 
heimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury); (d) not currently 
undergoing radiation or chemotherapy; (e) able to com- 
municate proficiently in written and spoken English; (f) 
adequate vision and hearing; and (g) residence within 100 
miles of the research center. From this, 135 participants 

were consented at baseline and administered a cognitive 
battery; based on their cognitive performance, the Frascati 
criteria were applied to determine whether participants 
met the criteria for HAND (described below). The 109 
participants who met the HAND criteria were informed 
of this and randomized into the study. The 26 participants 
who did not meet the HAND criteria were also informed 
of this result, at which point their participation ended. Par- 
ticipants were compensated for the pretest/posttest assess- 
ments ($50 each) and cognitive training sessions ($15/hour 
of cognitive training). 

Participants completed 1.5–2 h assessments at the research 
center at baseline/pretest and posttest. These assessments 
were administered by a trained cognitive tester who was 
supervised by the Principal Investigator to prevent drift in 
the cognitive assessment protocol. 

Age, gender, education, and other basic demographic infor- 
mation was determined by self-report at baseline.

A health questionnaire was administered at baseline in which 
participants indicated prescribed medications, and alcohol 
(i.e., number of drinks on a typical day when drinking) and 
tobacco use (i.e., number of cigarettes smoked per day). 
cognitive impairments are often considered. For this study, 
only cognitive performance was taken into consideration 
(e.g., meeting the criteria for the least severe category of 
HAND labeled as asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment 
[ANI]). (For more information regarding HAND and other 
TOPS methodological details, see Vance et al. [14]). 


Upon entering the study, participants’ medical providers 
were contacted for the following information: HIV-positive 
diagnosis confirmation, years diagnosed with HIV, current 
and nadir CD4+ lymphocyte count, current viral load, and 
HIV medication regimen. 

Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemio- 
logic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CES-D; [18]). 
A score of 16 or higher reflects significant depressive 
symptomology. 

Eight cognitive domains were assessed using standardized 
normed cognitive measures at pretest and posttest; these 
measures are commonly used in neuroAIDS research [9, 19]. 
Normed T-scores of the cognitive measures were used to 
approximate clinical ratings of cognitive functioning in each 
of the domains ranging from 1 (above average, if T-score is 
55 or higher) to 9 (severe impairment, if T-score is 19 or 
below). This cognitive battery consisted of: (1) SOP (Stroop 
Color Naming Test, Trails A); (2) attention (Paced Auditory 
Serial Attention Test); (3) executive function (Stroop Inter- 
ference), Trails B); (4) spatial learning and memory (Benton 
Visual Retention Test—Revised); (5) delayed spatial learn- 
ing and memory (Benton Visual Retention Test Delayed— 
Revised); (6) spatial visualization (WAIS IV Block Design); 
(7) verbal learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning 
Test—Revised); and (8) delayed verbal learning and mem- 
ory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Delayed—Revised) [9, 
19, 20]. Using this baseline cognitive battery, cognitive 
impairments were identified for training (see the Procedures/ 
Treatment section below). 
Using each participant’s cognitive domains test scores 
combined, an algorithm was used to calculate a Global Clin- 
ical Rating score ranging from 1 (above average) to 9 (severe 
impairment). Specifically, scores from 5 to 9 reflected in 
two cognitive domains indicated HAND. Thus, using this 
continuum, the Global Clinical Rating score of 5 or higher 
was indicative of HAND [9, 19]. In making a medical diag- 
nosis of HAND, other factors such as impairments in eve- 
ryday functioning and the contribution of comorbidities to 
Participants with HAND were randomized to the control 
group (n = 40) or the cognitive training group (n = 48). A 
block randomization strategy ensured a balanced assignment 
between women/men and Africans Americans/Caucasians. 
Time between baseline and posttest was approximately 
85.25 (SD = 48.69) days (control group = 84.48 (SD = 27.76) 
days; cognitive training group = 85.92 (SD = 61.22) days, 
t-value = 0.14(86), p-value = 0.89). Participants in the cog- 
nitive training group received ten hours of training in each 
of two areas of impairment detected during baseline test- 
ing. Under the supervision of a cognitive trainer, all cog- 
nitive training occurred at the research center to monitor 
participants’ progress, assist with logging onto the computer 
program, provide encouragement, and maintain treatment 
fidelity. The cognitive trainer was taught how to administer 
the cognitive training and was supervised by the Principal 
Investigator to avoid drift in the cognitive training protocol. 
Cognitive training requires intense focus and can result in 
fatigue. For this reason, breaks were provided to participants 
as needed. The training dose of ten hours in each of two 
cognitive domains (for a total of 20 h per participant) was 
selected based on the concern that training fatigue would 
lead to attrition as well as the U-shaped dosage-therapeutic 
response reported by Lampit et al. [13]. Other studies sup- 
port 10 h as a sufficient training dose to improve function in 
a particular cognitive domain [12, 21]. 
As mentioned, participants may have impairments in up 
to all eight cognitive domains; however, it is not feasible 
to target 80 h of cognitive training (i.e., 10 h of training/ 
domain × 8 cognitive domains). For this reason, a cognitive 
training algorithm was developed to target the cognitive 
domains that would be most likely to reverse the HAND 
diagnosis for each individual participant, and in which the 
participant might have the greatest amount of cognitive 
reserve. The Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training 
Framework was designed specifically for this study with 
three steps [14]. In step one, participants with impairments 
in either SOP (n = 22) or attention (n = 13) were automati- 
cally assigned cognitive training in one or both of those 
domains; as alluded to previously, these are considered 
core cognitive abilities that support the functioning of other 
cognitive domains. In step two, participants without impair- 
ments in either SOP or attention (or with impairments in 
only one) were assigned to cognitive training in their least 

 

compromised (but still impaired) cognitive domain(s) (i.e., 
closest to cutoff of 1 SD below the demographically-adjusted 
mean). The rationale for this was that participants may have 
more cognitive reserve in relatively preserved domains and 
may obtain greater benefit from training in these domains 
than in more compromised domains. This approach pur- 
posely manipulates the criteria by which HAND is diag- 
nosed by targeting the cognitive domain needing the least 
improvement to no longer meet the HAND criteria. 
In step three, participants were assigned to play comput- 
erized modules that were selected specifically to improve 
their abilities in the targeted cognitive domains. The mod- 
ules used for each cognitive domain were as follows: (a) 
SOP (Double Decision; Hawkeye; Visual Sweeps); (b) 
attention (Divided Attention; Target Tracker); (c) executive 
function (Mind Bender; Mixed Signals); (d) spatial learning 
and memory (Mental Maps; True North); (e) delayed spatial 
learning and memory (Mental Maps; True North); (f) spatial 
visualization (Mental Maps; True North); (g) verbal learn- 
ing and memory (Memory Grid; Syllable Stacks); and (h) 
delayed verbal learning and memory (Memory Grid; Sylla- 
ble Stacks). More information about these cognitive training 
modules can be found at www. brain hq. com. 
A treatment adherence checklist was used to review with 
participants the amount of time that they had engaged in 
cognitive training. The software also monitors the amount 
of time participants spend engaged in each exercise. The 
correlation between the checklist and the software on time 
engaged in cognitive training was very high r = 0.935; 
p = 0.001). For the convenience of the participants, they 
could do two hours of training at a time to reduce the num- 
ber of visits to the research center, but in general, most 
participants spread out their cognitive training sessions. 
Participants completed cognitive training in an average of 
approximately 12 weeks (averaging 1.66 h/week of cognitive 
training). Lampit and colleagues found optimal therapeutic 
effects occurred when training sessions are administered 
1–3 times per week—dosage parameters incorporated in the 
TOPS protocol [13]. Furthermore, similar to the seminal 
ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and 
Vital Elderly) Study (N = 2802), participants were consid- 
ered to be trained in each cognitive domain when they suc- 
cessfully completed 7–10 h of training in each domain [21]. 

To produce fair comparisons between study groups across 
cognitive domains, based on their baseline cognitive assess- 
ment, the same cognitive training assignment algorithm was 
applied to participants in the control group to determine the 
training they would have received had they been randomized 
to the individualized-training group [22]. Thus, outcomes 
from the trained group in a specific domain were compared 
to those from participants in the control group who were 
their matches in the sense that they would have received 
that specific training. From this, two sets of analyses were 
conducted, a completers-only analysis (n = 41 trained vs. 
n = 40 in the control group) and an intention to treat (ITT) 
analysis including n = 7 participants who did not complete 
training (n = 48 in the training group vs. n = 40 in the control 
group). The ITT results are presented in this report. A com- 
pleters-only analysis may be informative when examining 
the actual potential of the cognitive training, and results are 
available as supplemental materials (Supplemental tables 1, 
2 and 3). The main conclusions did not differ across the 
two sets of analyses, although there was some variability in 
the estimates, as expected from changes in small samples. 
The sample size considerations for the study were based 
on feasibility and, as with any pilot project [23], the study 
was not powered for formal statistical inference. Therefore, 
interpretation is based on in-sample measures of effect size 
and results are considered exploratory. Analysis began by 
examining balance between study groups with respect to 
baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, HIV mark- 
ers, etc.) using measures of effect size, such as Cohen’s d 
(small ~ 0.2, medium ~ 0.5, large ~ 0.8) and Cramer’s V 
(small ~ 0.1, medium ~ 0.3, large ~ 0.5, for cross-tabulations 
comparing two groups) [24]. Next, for each of the eight cog- 
nitive domain scores, descriptive statistics were tabulated at 
the pre- and post-intervention time-points by study group 
(matched by assigned training and hypothetical assigned 
training). Linear mixed-effects models with a random effect 
for subject were used to estimate the between-group dif- 
ference in change from pre- to post-intervention, using a 
time-by-group interaction coefficient. The variance compo- 
nents from each model were used to estimate a pooled SD for 
each domain score, which was then used to standardize the 
interaction coefficient and provide a measure of effect size 
(Cohen’s d). The Satterthwaite approximation to degrees of 
freedom was used for significance tests of the interaction 
effect. Analyses were conducted using R software version 
3.6 [25]. 


Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the N = 88 par- 
ticipants included in the ITT analysis. On average, par- 
ticipants were 54.2 (SD = 7) years old, about two thirds 
were male (n = 60, 68.2%), and the majority were African 
American (n = 75, 85.2%). Participants had an average of 
12.4 (SD = 2.2) years of education and reported an average 
income of approximately $17,600 (SD = $14,600). In terms

lowest recorded count/mm3 of 359.6 (SD = 352.9), and the

score was 17.5 (SD = 10.7), with n = 51 (58%) reporting 
CESD ≥ 16, indicating severe depressive symptomatology. 
Measures of effect size did not suggest any major imbalance 
between the study groups, however, a moderate difference 
in mean current CD4+ T lymphocyte count/mm3 scores was 
observed, with a higher value in the control group. On fur- 
ther inspection, it was found that the difference came from 
the right tail of the distribution with a few participants hav- 
ing relatively high CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. After a log 
transformation of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, the between- 
group standardized difference was reduced to d = 0.2 (a 
small effect size). 

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics and measures of train- 
ing effect overall and by each specific cognitive domain. The 
between-group comparisons for specific domains include 
only participants trained in that domain vs. matched con- 
trol participants (i.e., control participants who would have 
received training in that domain had they been randomized 
to the training group). A small beneficial intervention effect 
(d = − 0.21) was observed for the Global Clinical Rat- 
ing. Large beneficial effects were observed for the SOP 
(d = − 0.88), Executive Function (d = − 0.89), and Spatial 
Learning and Memory (d = − 0.71)) domains. Medium to 
moderate beneficial effects were observed for Attention 
(d = − 0.45) and Delayed Spatial Memory (d = − 0.32)). A 
moderate detrimental effect was observed for the Delayed 
Verbal Memory (d = 0.35) domain. 
Table 3 presents measures of training effect on all 
cognitive domains, comparing participants trained in a 
specific domain vs. their respective matched control par- 
ticipants. Herein, due to the number of comparisons, we 
focused on the medium to large effects (d ≥ 0.5), ignor- 
ing trivial and small effects. Compared to their control 
counterparts, participants who received SOP training 
showed medium to large improvements on Attention, Ver- 
bal Learning and Memory, Delayed Verbal Memory, and 
Executive Functioning (d ranging from − 0.7 to − 0.63). 
Participants who received Attention training showed a 
medium to large improvement on Executive Functioning 
and Delayed Verbal Memory. Participants who received 
Delayed Verbal Memory training showed medium to large

Cognitive domain for the cog-

No-contact control group 
(n = 40) 
Individualized-targeted cogni- 
tive training (n = 48) 

*Lower scores indicate better functioning. Cognitive ratings range from: 1 = above average; 2 = average; 3 = low average; 4 = borderline; 5 = defi- 
nite mild impairment; 6 = mild-to-moderate impairment; 7 = moderate impairment; 8 = moderate-to-severe impairment; 9 = severe impairment. 
For comparison purposes, controls in this analysis were compared to treatment group as if they were assigned a similar hypothetical assignment 

improvements on SOP and Executive Functioning. Par- 
ticipants who received Executive Functioning training 
showed medium to large improvements on SOP, Attention, 
and Delayed Verbal Memory. Participants who received 
Spatial Learning and Memory training showed medium 
to large improvements on SOP, Delayed Verbal Memory, 
and Executive Functioning. Participants who received 
Delayed Spatial Memory training showed medium to 
large improvements on SOP and Attention. Participants 
who received Spatial Visualization training showed a large 
detrimental effect on Executive Functioning. 

For the purpose of providing information on potential char- 
acteristics of participants at risk of attrition from future 
cognitive training studies, measures of effect size were used 
to compare the n = 21 participants who were lost to follow- 
up vs. the n = 88 who provided a post-test assessment, on 
sociodemographic characteristics and baseline cognitive 
scores. In terms of the relevant differences found, partici- 
pants who dropped from the study were more likely to be 
assigned to cognitive training (n = 16, 76.2% vs. n = 48, 
54.5%, V = 0.17); tended to be older (M[SD] = 54.2[6.97] 
vs. 50.9[4.7], d = 0.5)); tended to have more years of edu- 
cation (M[SD] = 12.4[2.2] vs. 11.4[2.6], d = 0.46); tended 
to have slightly lower depression symptoms (CESD: 
M[SD] = 17.54[10.7] vs. 20.7[9.6], d = 0.31); and tended to 
consume more alcohol (no. daily drinks: M[SD] = 1.8 [0.9] 
vs. 1.3[0.6], d = 0.61). 

Aim 1 of this study was to examine whether a person- 
centered cognitive training intervention targeting impaired 
individual cognitive domains would reduce the incidence of 
HAND diagnoses. An early interim descriptive study (n = 6) 
comparing experimental and control participants of TOPS 
showed observable cognitive improvement in those who 
received cognitive training, but no change in HAND diag- 
nosis [26]. Completion of the TOPS study revealed similar 
findings; global clinical rating improved, but not to the point 
in which a HAND diagnosis could be changed (i.e., at post- 
test 6 (15%) control and 3 (6.25%) experimental participants 
no longer met the criteria for HAND). Therefore, the inter- 
vention was not effective in changing the diagnosis; how- 
ever, additional analyses on individual domains suggested 
the intervention exerted therapeutic cognitive benefits. 
Aim 2 of this study was to examine, overall, whether 
cognitive training could produce cognitive changes, even 
if not effective in reducing the incidence of HAND. As 
observed in our analyses, SOP was improved. Furthermore, 
some support for the Salthouse Diminished SOP Theory was 
found in that improved SOP transferred to improvement in 
other cognitive domains (i.e., attention, verbal learning and 
memory, delayed verbal learning and memory, executive 
functioning); this suggests that SOP as a cognitive domain 
supports the functioning of other domains. Our finding also 
corresponds to the meta-analysis by Lampit and colleagues 
which found SOP training to be the most robust cognitive 
training approach [13]. Of interest, cognitive training in 
domains other than SOP also transferred to improvements 











 

in non-trained domains, particularly SOP and executive 
functioning. This suggests wide-spread neural activation 
reflective of positive neuroplasticity [27]. 

Several important considerations for clinical practice fol- 
low from this study. First, of the 135 participants at base- 
line, 109 (81%) met the cognitive definition of HAND. Such 
a high incidence of HAND suggests that monitoring and 
screening for cognitive health is an essential component of 
a routine visit. Second, coupled with the existing literature, 
this study provides partial support for the use of cognitive 
training to remediate or protect cognition, especially in the 
domains of SOP and executive function [12]. In fact, in the 
ACTIVE study, older participants who received SOP train- 
ing also experienced other therapeutic benefits including 
reduced incidence of depression and dementia over time 
[28],and also improved in the areas of locus of control, self- 
rated health, health-related quality of life, driving safety 
and mobility, and everyday functioning as measured by 
the TIADL test [29, 30]. As mentioned earlier, in a sepa- 
rate study of 46 PWH randomized to SOP training or a no- 
contact control group, Vance and colleagues also observed 
improved performance in everyday functioning as measured 
by the TIADL after cognitive training [12]. Currently there 
are no consensus guidelines for the treatment of HAND and 
HIV-related cognitive impairment; however, it is likely that 
cognitive training will be one of the recommendations mov- 
ing forward, along with encouraging healthy lifestyle behav- 
iors (i.e., ↑ physical exercise, ↓ stress). Third, a diagnosis of 
HAND can generate much angst and confusion. In fact, in 
this TOPS study, we informed participants of their HAND 
diagnosis and at posttest qualitatively assessed their reac- 
tion to receiving this news from us [31]. The themes that 
emerged were Sadness, Anxiety, Unexpected, Concerned, 
Not Concerned/No Reaction, but surprisingly other themes 
included Confirmation (that they knew they were experi- 
encing cognitive issues), Knowledge Seeking, and Desire 
to Improve. Particularly noteworthy, participants wanted to 
know more about how to treat HAND and improve and pro- 
tect their cognitive abilities, thus assuaging their fears and 
improving their quality of life. Engaging in cognitive train- 
ing can be part of that approach. 

Although cognitive training was somewhat effective in 
improving some cognitive domains, the algorithm used to 
select training domains may not be the most therapeutic for 
two reasons. First, as we selected the least impaired cognitive 
domains for training (unless SOP or attention impairments 
were detected), participants may not have had to improve 
much in order to rise above the criterion for HAND. Sec- 
ond, it is possible that targeting the most impaired domains, 
instead of the least impaired, may produce the greatest over- 
all cognitive improvement by reducing intra-individual vari- 
ability (i.e., dispersion) in cognitive functioning [32, 33]. 
Studies suggest that greater variability in performance across 
cognitive domains (e.g., very poor executive function and 
SOP, but superior verbal memory) predicts progressive cog- 
nitive decline. In fact, intra-individual variability is related 
to cognitive decline in older adults [34], structural atrophy 
in hippocampal and entorhinal areas in normal older adults 
and adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [33], and 
everyday functioning deficits in older PWH [32]. Thus, tar- 
geting those out of range, most impaired, cognitive domains 
for cognitive training may be a better therapeutic approach 
than the algorithm tested in the TOPS study. So instead of 
training to the diagnostic criteria of HAND, cognitive train- 
ing targeting the most impaired cognitive domain may be 
more clinically relevant. Yet this approach assumes that one 
has enough cognitive reserve within that domain to benefit 
from the cognitive training [11, 35]. 

All studies have limitation and strengths; this study is 
no exception. Notable study limitations are below. First, 
although standardized cognitive measures were used, no 
true test of each cognitive domain exists. All domain-spe- 
cific cognitive tests minimize, but never eliminate com- 
pletely (i.e., spillover effect) the contribution of other cog- 
nitive domains to task performance. Second and similarly, 
although cognitive training is directed toward strengthen- 
ing function in one specific cognitive domain, such ben- 
efits also spillover to other domains. Third, it is not clear 
whether the training effects observed are robust over time 
as this was not a longitudinal study. Fourth, due to financial 
limitations of this pilot study, a no-contact control group 
was employed; in future studies, a social and computer con- 
tact control group would have provided a more matched, 
meaningful comparison [36]. In fact, in a cognitive training 
study that used both a no-contact control group and social/ 
computer-contact groups, the effect sizes between the two 
control groups were very similar, which demonstrates that 
they are both effective control groups [37]. Fifth, some attri- 
tion bias may have occurred, with those being assigned to 
the experimental group being slightly more likely to drop out 
of the study, possibly due to the demands of the cognitive 
training. Sixth, although we used a randomization proce- 
dure to control for race and gender, other criteria were not 
considered due to the small sample size. Seventh, as in any 
intervention study, there is the possibility of attention bias 
in that participants may perceive their cognition is improv- 
ing by engaging in the cognitive intervention, regardless of 

whether there is any therapeutic efficacy to the intervention. 
And finally, some self-report items were used (i.e., depres- 
sive symptomatology). 
Likewise, three study strengths were noted. First, we used 
accepted procedures and norm-based standardized cogni- 
tive performance measures to diagnosis HAND. Second, we 
employed a block randomization procedure to control for 
race and gender. And third, we used commercially available, 
standardized cognitive training modules; this ensured that 
the participants received the exact training within each of 
the distinct cognitive domains being targeted. 

In summary, this study is innovative in delivering a combi- 
nation of cognitive training protocols in an individualized 
manner tailored to the participants’ cognitive performance 
level. Although the overall approach was not effective in 
reducing the incidence of HAND, cognitive improvement 
was observed following some cognitive training protocols, 
especially SOP. Future research may consider other algo- 
rithms in which computerized cognitive domain training can 
be combined with other cognitive strategies (e.g., reducing 
intra-individual variability to produce better cognitive stabil- 
ity), and possibly paired with other therapies (e.g., transcra- 
nial direct current stimulation, nootropics) to improve and 
protect cognition as PWH age.
