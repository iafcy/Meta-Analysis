HIV-associated neurocognitive impairments that impact daily function persist in the era of 
effective antiretroviral therapy. Cognitive training, a promising low-cost intervention, has been 
shown to improve neurocognitive functioning in some clinical populations. We tested the 
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of computerized cognitive training to improve 
working memory in persons living with HIV infection (PLWH) and working memory impairment. 
In this randomized clinical trial, we assigned 21 adult PLWH to either an experimental cognitive 
training intervention or an attention-matched control training intervention. Participants completed 
12 training sessions across 10 weeks with assessments at baseline and post-training. Session 
attendance was excellent and participants rated the program positively. Participants in the 
experimental arm demonstrated improved working memory function over time; participants in the 
control arm showed no change. Our results suggest that cognitive training may be a promising 
intervention for working memory impairment in PLWH and should be evaluated further.

While the presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (NCI) has evolved in 
the era of modern antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-associated NCI continues to be a 
serious complication of HIV infection (Heaton et al., 2010; Robertson et al., 2007; Sacktor, 
2002). More than half of the 1.2 million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the United 
States experience NCI (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015; Heaton et al., 
2010). These impairments impact daily functioning and are predictive of adverse outcomes 
(Benedict, Mezhir, Walsh, & Hewitt, 2000; Gongvatana et al., 2009; Heaton, Marcotte, et al., 
2004; Lovejoy & Suhr, 2009; Marcotte et al., 2004; Rabkin, McElhiney, Ferrando, Van 
Gorp, & Lin, 2004; Vivithanaporn et al., 2010). Of particular relevance for PLWH, NCI is 
associated with both increased HIV risk behaviors and suboptimal ART medication 
adherence, which in turn can exacerbate NCI (Anand, Springer, Copenhaver, & Altice, 2010; 
Shrestha & Copenhaver, 2016). The clinical focus for managing NCI thus far has been on 
optimizing medication regimens to minimize the impact of HIV on the central nervous 
system (Clifford & Ances, 2013), but more attention is needed on developing interventions 
that directly address the NCI that continues to occur despite ART. 
In particular, working memory is an important target for intervention. Working memory 
involves short-term storage and processing of information from the present environment to 
accomplish complex cognitive tasks, which can include both reasoning and decision making 
(Baddeley, 1986). As a critical executive function, working memory has been linked closely 
to impulsive decision making (Hinson, Jameson, & Whitney, 2003; Shamosh et al., 2008) 
and self-regulation processes (Hofmann, Schmeichel, & Baddeley, 2012). Indeed, 
computerized working memory training led to decreased impulsive decision making in 
stimulant users in one study (Bickel, Yi, Landes, Hill, & Baxter, 2011). Working memory is 
particularly important for daily functioning, and research in PLWH has shown that working 
memory impairment is a strong predictor of failures in instrumental activities of daily living 
and other functional assessments (Heaton, Marcotte, et al., 2004). 
Originally developed to treat the major cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia, cognitive 
training has been successfully used in a range of conditions associated with cognitive 
deficits (e.g., aging, depression; Keshavan, Vinogradov, Rumsey, Sherrill, & Wagner, 2014). 
While some pilot work has been done (Becker et al., 2012; Boivin et al., 2010; Cody, Fazeli, 
& Vance, 2015; Vance, Fazeli, Ross, Wadley, & Ball, 2012), the potential for cognitive 
training to mitigate deficits found in HIV-associated NCI remains understudied. Cognitive 
training is a promising low-cost intervention that harnesses the brain’s neuroplastic 
capabilities. Training can be delivered by a therapist, workbook, or computer program, and 
progression is individualized as needed. Mechanistically, cognitive training is thought to 
target underlying neural processes using a variety of methods, including exercises to 
improve cognitive skills and compensatory strategies to minimize deficits (McGurk, 
Twamley, Sitzer, McHugo, & Mueser, 2007). Given potentially limited resources in clinical 
settings, cognitive training delivered via a computer program is particularly promising, as it 
would be low cost-effective and require minimal staff time. 
We tested the feasibility and preliminary effects of a computerized cognitive training 
program to improve working memory in PLWH. In this randomized clinical trial, we 
assigned adult PLWH to one of two arms: the experimental intervention (active cognitive 


 


training) or an attention control training intervention. Participants completed assessments at 
baseline and post-training. We hypothesized that participants assigned to active cognitive 
training, compared to those in the attention-matched control arm, would have greater 
improvements in working memory. 


Adult PLWH with working memory impairment were recruited from the Durham area 
between January 2015 and May 2016 via flyers and brochures at community-based 
organizations and infectious diseases clinics. Interested participants completed a brief 
preliminary eligibility screener and, if eligible, then completed an in-person visit that 
screened for study eligibility more comprehensively. Eligible participants returned for 
baseline assessment on another day. 
The baseline assessment included a neuropsychological battery to assess current functioning. 
After completing the baseline assessment, participants were randomly assigned to one of 
two arms (active cognitive training or control training) using simple randomization 
generated by a computer program. Randomization was completed by the principal 
investigator after baseline assessment so that assignment was unknown at the time of 
baseline evaluation. The study team was not blinded to treatment assignment after 
randomization. Participants in both arms then completed 12 training sessions, which 
occurred over 10 weeks. The first session was scheduled within 1 week of the baseline. 
Participants were asked to schedule 2 sessions per week, but 10 weeks were allowed to 
account for missed or cancelled sessions. Participants were not allowed to exceed 2 sessions 
per week. At training sessions, participants assigned to the active cognitive training group 
completed computerized modules designed to enhance working memory, while those 
assigned to the attention-matched control group completed inactive modules that were not 
designed to enhance memory. Training sessions consisted of 5 commercially available 
memory-training tasks from the PSSCogRehab software program, which has been used in a 
wide variety of conditions including schizophrenia, brain injury, and substance abuse (http:// 
www.psychological-software.com/PSS/pssnew/). Within 1 week of the last session, 
participants returned to complete a post-training assessment to evaluate the effects of the 
training intervention. 
Participants were compensated for all visits, including sessions. They received $35 USD for 
the screening visit, $65 USD for the baseline visit, and $85 USD for the post-training 
follow-up. For training sessions, participants were compensated $10 USD for each attended 
session for their time, and earned a cumulative $1 USD bonus for each consecutively 
attended session to encourage consistent session attendance. Therefore, participants could 
earn up to $21 USD for the final session if all 12 sessions were completed consecutively 
within the 10-week time frame. Total potential earnings for completing all sessions were 
$186 USD. To maintain the attendance bonus, participants were required to attend at least 
one session per week. The bonus reset to $1 USD if the participant failed to attend at least 1 
session per week. 


 


Figure 1 shows the flow of participants through the study. Study procedures were approved 
by the institutional review board at Duke University Health System and was registered on 
ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02216591). Participants provided written informed 
consent prior to any study activities. 

The sample included adults living with HIV infection, ages 18–65 years, and living 
independently in the community; the study was open to all gender and racial/ethnic 
identities. Participants had to be in HIV care and on ART for more than 3 months. Because 
the intervention target was working memory, participants had to demonstrate working 
memory impairment, defined as either (a) a T score less than or equal to 40 (i.e., more than 
one standard deviation below average performance) on at least 1 of 2 tests of working 
memory, or (b) T scores less than or equal to 50 (the normative mean) on both tests of 
working memory. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of current substance use disorder 
and/or any drug use other than alcohol or marijuana in the previous 90 days (as verified by 
interview and a urine drug screen). To minimize potential confounds, individuals had to be 
diagnosed with HIV for longer than 6 months (i.e., no longer experiencing acute HIV 
infection). To minimize potential attrition, individuals who lived more than 15 miles away 
from Duke Medical Center and individuals who stated they were planning to move away 
from the area within the next 3 months were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria were: 
English non-fluency; 8th grade education or less; serious neurological disorders, including 
HIV dementia; traumatic brain injury; severe mental illness or acute psychiatric distress; 
impaired mental status; or pregnancy. 

The screening visit included clinical interviews of HIV tests and staging (RAND 
Corporation, 2007), HIV medication adherence (Giordano, Guzman, Clark, Charlebois, & 
Bangsberg, 2004), medical, psychiatric and substance use history (First, Spitzer, Gibbon, & 
Williams, 1996; McGahan, Griffith, Parente, & McLellan, 1986; McLellan et al., 1992; 
Sheehan et al., 1998), and computerized questionnaires that assessed demographics. The 
visit also included urine tests for pregnancy and recent drug use. Participants completed the 
Wechsler Test of Adult Reading, which estimated premorbid verbal IQ by asking 
participants to read aloud 50 words that had atypical grapheme to phoneme translations 
(Wechsler, 2001). To assess current working memory function, participants completed the 
NAB Digits Forward/Digits Backward Test (Stern & White, 2009). Finally, participants 
provided authorization for the release of their health care records to research staff, who 
abstracted HIV clinical variables, including the date of HIV diagnosis, most recent and nadir 
CD4+ T cell count, most recent HIV viral load test, and history of an AIDS diagnosis. 

Neuropsychological function was assessed using a 45-minute battery that covered 7 domains 
of function. The domains were consistent with recommendations for assessing HIV- 
associated NCI, and similar batteries have been found to be sensitive to HIV-associated NCI 
(Antinori et al., 2007). While working memory was the primary outcome measure of 
interest, 6 additional domains were assessed to examine the specificity of the training: 


 




Processing speed: Trail Making Test Part A – number of seconds to completion 
(Reitan & Wolfson, 1993) 
Learning (immediate recall): Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT-R) 
– total number of words recalled on trials 1–3 (Brandt & Benedict, 2001) 



Executive function: Stroop Color and Word Test interference score – difference 
between actual and predicted score on the Color-Word trial (Golden, 1978); Trail 
Making Test Part B – number of seconds to completion (Reitan & Wolfson, 
1993) 



(Diehr et al., 2003); NAB Digits Forward/Digits Backward Test – number correct 
(Stern & White, 2009) 


Using the most up-to-date published normative data, raw test scores were converted to T- 
scores that corrected for demographic factors such as age and education (Diehr et al., 2003; 
Heaton, Miller, Taylor, & Grant, 2004; Norman et al., 2011; Stern & White, 2009). Overall 
domain scores were computed by averaging T-scores of the tests within each domain. 





Sequenced recall of digits - auditory (SRD-A): Participants recalled numbers 
presented aloud. The first trial included three numbers, and each subsequent trial 
increased by one digit following a correct response. If the participant responded 
incorrectly, a different sequence of the same length was presented. The test 
ended after five misses. 
Sequenced Recall Reversed Digits - Auditory (SRRD-A): This module had the 
same requirements as SRD-A, except that participants recalled the digits in the 
reverse order. 
Sequenced Recall of Words - Visual (SRW-V): Participants studied a list of four- 
letter words and then attempted to find them in the correct order from a list of 16 
words. The first trial included three words, and each subsequent trial increased 
by one word following a correct response, up to 11-words. If the participant 
responded incorrectly, a different list of the same number of words was 
presented. The test ended after five misses. 

Spatial Memory – Objects and Locations (SM-OL). Participants viewed a display 
of 30 pictures. Some of the pictures then appeared on the screen for the 


 


participants to memorize. All 30 pictures then re-appeared and participants 
selected the pictures they memorized. If the participant provided an incorrect 
response, the same array was repeated. The test ended after four misses. 

Visual Memory – Sequenced Blocks (VM-SB). Participants saw 12 blocks on the 
screen and watched a hand-shaped cursor touch a series of them. Then 
participants selected the blocks in the same order. If a participant made an error, 
the same sequence was presented. The test ended after three errors in the same 
sequence. 
In each training session, participants completed each of the memory training modules once 
and then completed the module a second time if the first administration did not last at least 5 
minutes. 
Control Training (CON)—The same computer modules were used in the control group 
sessions. However, the control modules did not progressively increase in difficulty across 
trials, such that participants’ working memory was not challenged over the course of the 
modules. Participants in the CON group completed each module at the lowest level of 
difficulty for 5 minutes per module. 

The full neuropsychological assessment battery was repeated at the post-training follow-up 
visit. Participants also completed an intervention process assessment to describe their 
experiences of the intervention and provide feedback on perceived benefits; barriers to 
attendance; and the length, number, and content of sessions. The assessment included ratings 
of satisfaction and helpfulness. Participants used a 5-point scale to rate their overall 
satisfaction with the program (1 = Very dissatisfied, 2 = Somewhat dissatisfied, 3 = Neutral, 
4 = Somewhat satisfied, 5 = Very satisfied) as well as how helpful they thought the program 
was (1 = Very unhelpful, 2 = Somewhat unhelpful, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Somewhat helpful, 5 = 
V 


Analyses were conducted using SPSS 24.0.0.0. Descriptive statistics were used to 
characterize the sample, and baseline group differences on demographic and HIV 
characteristics were examined using chi-square, independent samples t-tests, and the Mann- 
Whitey U test. To examine feasibility and acceptability, independent samples t-tests were 
used to examine group differences on session attendance and intervention process 
assessment questionnaire responses. To examine intervention effects on neuropsychological 
outcomes, we conducted a series of 2 (Arm: ACT vs. CON) × 2 (Time: Baseline vs. Post) 
mixed-model general linear model analyses. Time was the within-subjects factor defined by 
baseline versus post-training follow-up, and study arm was the between-subjects factor. Age 
and years of education were included as covariates. 


 




The sample included 21 adults. Eleven participants were randomized to the ACT arm and 10 
participants were randomized to the CON arm. The sample was mostly male (n = 16, 76%) 
and African American (n = 18, 86%). Participants were 47.90 years of age on average (SD = 
11.15), with a mean of 13.38 years of education (SD = 2.46), and most (82%) had at least a 
high school education. Participants had been diagnosed with HIV for 13.86 years on average 
(SD = 7.99). All participants were receiving ART and were prescribed an average of 2.05 
HIV different pills (SD = 1.02). Participants reported taking approximately 93% (SD = 15%) 
of the prescribed doses of ART in the 4 weeks prior to the screening visit. Nearly half the 
sample (n = 10, 48%) had a detectable viral load (≥ 50 copies/mL). The median most recent 
CD4+ T cell count was 561 cells/mm3 (IQR = 410) and the median nadir CD4+ T cell count 
was 135 cells/mm3 (IQR = 348). Table 1 compares the study groups on demographic, HIV, 
and other characteristics. There were no group differences on any of these characteristics, 
indicating that randomization was effective. 

Participants completed an average of 11.38 (SD = 2.25) sessions out of 12 possible. Within 
the ACT group, 100% (n = 11) of participants completed all sessions. Within the CON 
group, 80% (n = 8) of participants completed all sessions. Of the 2 CON participants who 
did not complete all sessions, one completed 9 sessions and the other completed only 2 
sessions. Both participants reported that work schedules were the principal obstacle to 
completing more sessions. 
There was no difference between arms on overall satisfaction and helpfulness ratings, with 
participants in both groups indicating that they felt satisfied with the sessions and found 
them helpful. As shown in Table 2, the ratings between groups were highly similar, with 
group differences occurring in only 2 items. ACT participants more strongly disagreed than 
CON participants with the statement that using the computer during sessions was difficult, 
and participants in the ACT group more strongly agreed that they would be willing to 
complete a similar program of training on their own than the CON participants. 

Retention to the post-training follow-up was high (95%), with 20 out of 21 participants 
completing the follow-up. The participant who did not complete the follow-up was the 
participant assigned to the CON arm who completed only 2 training sessions. We made 
extensive outreach attempts to schedule him for his post-training follow-up despite his drop- 
out from sessions, but he did not respond to outreach attempts. Therefore, the sample for 
outcome analyses included 11 participants from the ACT arm and 9 participants from the 
CON arm. 
In the 2 (Arm) × 2 (Time) mixed-model general linear model on working memory with age 
and education covaried, a significant main effect of time, F(1,16) = 6.89, p = 0.018, was 
qualified by a significant interaction effect of time by arm, F(1,16) = 7.76, p = 0.013. 


 


Adjusted means indicated that participants in ACT showed a significant increase in the mean 
working memory T score from baseline (M = 45.08) to post (M = 51.33) compared to CON 
participants (η2= .327, indicating a large effect size), whose scores were largely unchanged 
(baseline M = 43.89 and post M = 43.15). There were no significant main or interaction 
effects for any other domains examined (all p > .05). 

Our study provides preliminary support for the acceptability and potential efficacy of a 
computerized cognitive training program to improve working memory function in a sample 
of PLWH with working memory impairment. Overall, participants were satisfied with the 
program and rated it positively. Outcome analyses supported that this type of computerized 
training could significantly improve working memory performance. Indeed, for participants 
in the ACT arm, working memory standardized T scores went from 5 points below mean 
performance to just over mean performance at the post-training follow-up, while 
performance in the CON group was unchanged. 
The results support our hypothesis that the cognitive training program would lead to 
improvements in working memory for the active training group, and that working memory 
for the control training group would not change. We found no other significant effects across 
any of the other neuropsychological domains measured, which indicated that that the effects 
of training were specific to working memory function. These findings provide support for 
the potential of working memory training to be an effective intervention for HIV-associated 
working memory impairment. Our findings add to an emerging literature that supports the 
feasibility of computerized cognitive training and its potential efficacy in other cognitive 
domains for PLWH. One study in a cohort of children living with HIV infection in Uganda 
found that a computerized training program for simple attention and processing speed 
showed promising results in improving function in those domains (Boivin et al., 2010). 
Another study examined a cognitive stimulant program in a sample of 60 participants (with 
and without HIV infection) and found that neurocognitive function improved for participants 
who used the program the most (Becker et al., 2012). Two other studies using speed of 
processing training in middle-aged and older adults with HIV also showed promising effects 
of training on neurocognitive outcomes (Cody et al., 2015; Vance et al., 2012). Our study is 
the first to focus on working memory, a core cognitive function that is important for daily 
living. 
Based on responses to the intervention process assessment, participants perceived the 
training program to be helpful. Participants across both arms rated the program highly across 
multiple characteristics and, most importantly, participants in the ACT group expressed 
willingness to complete a program such as this on their own. These results support the 
feasibility of implementing this type of intervention and indicate that it was acceptable to 
participants. Importantly, participants did not endorse attending solely because of the 
monetary reimbursement for sessions or the attendance bonuses. In addition to participant 
ratings, session attendance for enrolled participants was excellent, with all ACT participants 
completing 100% of sessions. High attendance rates also support the feasibility and 
acceptability of the intervention. 


 


Recruitment was a significant challenge during this clinical trial, with an average enrollment 
of 1 per month. Recruitment was extended for 6 months in order to reach a final sample size 
of at least 20 participants. There were two major barriers to enrollment, both of which 
primarily occurred before an in-person appointment was ever scheduled. First, at pre- 
screening, many participants declined to participate after hearing about study details because 
coming to the lab twice per week during regular business hours to complete the sessions was 
impractical due to work or other commitments. Second, many patients were ruled out at pre- 
screening because they lived more than 15 miles away from the medical center. This 
eligibility criterion was intended to minimize attrition in the clinical trial, but it also 
excluded a proportion of the patients served at local HIV clinics who traveled a good 
distance for their appointments. Our medical center serves a large catchment area, including 
patients living in rural communities of North Carolina and surrounding states. With 
increasing recognition of the physical barriers to HIV care and associated treatments, the 
National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States has emphasized the importance of 
developing innovative models of care to improve access for those living in remote or rural 
areas (The White House, 2015). To address these challenges, future trials examining 
cognitive training should use web-based services that can be completed remotely, either at 
home or at a facility where computers are available for public use (e.g., a library). 
Our study had several notable strengths, including a sound experimental design, 
comprehensive assessment battery, and excellent retention rates. Moreover, we observed a 
significant effect in working memory that supported the potential efficacy of the cognitive 
training program used in this study. At the same time, the study had several limitations that 
should be discussed. First, the duration and frequency of the intervention (12 sessions over 
about 6 weeks) was fairly minimal intensity compared to other cognitive training 
interventions (Vinogradov, Fisher, & de Villers-Sidani, 2012). Future studies should test 
whether effects can be enhanced by using more intensive interventions. Second, the post- 
training follow-up occurred within 1 week of the final training session, so our results do not 
speak to the long-term durability of training effects. Longer follow-up periods are necessary 
to assess how long functional gains made during training are maintained. Third, our sample 
demonstrated only moderate working memory impairment at baseline. Future studies should 
focus on vulnerable populations, including those with more serious working memory 
impairment or those with co-morbid conditions that might contribute to NCI, such as 
substance abuse. Finally, there was some overlap in the cognitive training tasks (sequenced 
recall of digits and sequenced recall of digits reversed) and the working memory assessment 
used at baseline and post-training (Digit Span forwards and backwards). Therefore, it is 
possible that participants improved on those tasks specifically as a result of training and 
those improvements may not generalize to all aspects of working memory function. Future 
studies should use training tasks and neuropsychological assessments that do not have this 
type of overlap. In addition, future studies should include assessments that evaluate real- 
world functional impairments associated with NCI. 

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy 
of computerized working memory training. Our results highlight that cognitive training is a 


 


potentially useful intervention to address HIV-associated NCI. Additional research with 
larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the efficacy of this intervention and to evaluate 
Web-based cognitive training to improve dissemination to a larger number of PLWH who 
experience NCI.

Working memory impairment, a common feature of HIV-associated 
neurocognitive disorder, can have impact on other aspects of cognition as well 
as on daily function. 
Developing cost-effective interventions to address this impairment in persons 
living with HIV is critical. 
Computerized cognitive training is a particularly promising intervention, as it 
is low-cost and requires minimal staff time. 
The results of our pilot study demonstrated the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of computerized working memory training to address 
working memory impairment in persons living with HIV infection. 
Additional research with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm the 
efficacy of this intervention.
