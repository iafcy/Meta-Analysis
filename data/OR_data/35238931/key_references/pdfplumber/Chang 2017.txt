Objective: We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an adaptive working memory (WM) training (WMT) program,
the corresponding neural correlates, and LMX1A-rs4657412 polymorphism on the adaptive WMT, in human immuno-
deficiency virus(HIV) participants compared toseronegative(SN) controls.
Methods: A total of 201 of 206 qualified participants completed baseline assessments before randomization to 25
sessions of adaptive WMT or nonadaptive WMT. A total of 74 of 76 (34 HIV, 42 SN) completed adaptive WMT and
all 40 completed nonadaptive WMT (20 HIV, 20 SN) and were assessed after 1 month, and 55 adaptive WMT partici-
pants were also assessed after 6 months. Nontrained near-transfer WM tests (Digit-Span, Spatial-Span), self-reported
executive functioning, and functional magnetic resonance images during 1-back and 2-back tasks were performed at
baseline andeach follow-up visit,and LMX1A-rs4657412was genotypedin allparticipants.
Results: Although HIV participants had slightly lower cognitive performance and start index than SN at baseline,
both groups improved on improvement index (>30%; false discovery rate [FDR] corrected p<0.0008) and non-
trained WM tests after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p(cid:2)0.001), but not after nonadaptive WMT (training by train-
ing type corrected, p50.01 to p50.05) 1 month later. HIV participants (especially LMX1A-G carriers) also had
poorer self-reported executive functioning than SN, but both groups reported improvements after adaptive WMT
(Global: training FDR corrected, p50.004), and only HIV participants improved after nonadaptive WMT. HIV partici-
pants also had greater frontal activation than SN at baseline, but brain activation decreased in both groups at 1 and
6 months after adaptive WMT (FDR corrected, p<0.0001), with normalization of brain activation in HIV participants,
especially theLMX1A-AA carriers(LMX1A genotypeby HIVstatus, cluster-corrected-p<0.0001).
Interpretation: Adaptive WMT, but not nonadaptive WMT, improved WM performance in both SN and HIV partici-
pants, and the accompanied decreased or normalized brain activation suggest improved neural efficiency, especially
in HIV-LMX1A-AA carriers who might have greater dopaminergic reserve. These findings suggest that adaptive WMT
maybeaneffectiveadjunctive therapyfor WM deficitsinHIV participants.
