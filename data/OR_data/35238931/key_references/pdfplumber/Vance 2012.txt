Abstract
Adults with HIV are at risk for deficits in speed of processing that can interfere with performing
instrumental activities of daily living. In this pilot study, 46 middle-age and older adults with HIV
were assigned to 10 hours of computerized speed of processing training (n = 22) or to a no-contact
control condition (n = 24). ANCOVAs were used to examine treatment effects on a neurocognitive
battery and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) Test. Treatment effects
were detected on the Useful Field of View® Test, F(1, 43) = 4.29, p = .04 and the TIADL Test,
F(1, 43) = 5.02, p = .03; those in the experimental condition improved on these measures. Many of
the participants also indicated that they felt the training improved their cognitive functioning. This
study demonstrated that speed of processing training may improve cognitive and everyday
functioning in this growing population.

Due to the life extending benefits of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), there has been
an increased prevalence of adults and older adults living with HIV in the United States.
Specifically, more than 25% of people living with HIV in the United States are older than 50
years of age (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2008), and this prevalence

is expected to increase to more than half of the HIV population by 2015 (Kirk & Goetz,
2009). Although ART has dramatically decreased HIV-related dementias and has vastly
extended life, many concerns remain that, as people age with HIV, they will be more
vulnerable to age-related cognitive deficits that impair everyday functioning. Declines in
speed of processing are a particular concern because this cognitive domain is sensitive to the
effects of both HIV and aging (Reger, Welsh, Razani, Martin, & Boone, 2002). Wilkie and
colleagues (2003) administered a number of neuropsychological measures to 81 younger
(20–39 years) and 68 older (50+ years) adults with and without HIV and found that the older
adults with HIV performed the worst. In an 8-year longitudinal study, Baldewicz and
colleagues (2004) examined the neuropsychological functioning of adults with and without
HIV and found significant declines in speed of processing in the HIV-infected group.
Likewise, a meta-analysis of 41 studies on the neuropsychological sequelae of HIV infection
found that speed of processing was one of the cognitive domains demonstrating the greatest
decline from early to late stages of HIV (Reger et al., 2002). Thus, adults aging with HIV
may be at an increased risk for speed of processing declines.
Review of the Literature
Everyday Functioning and HIV
Studies have examined how neuropsychological functioning in adults with HIV impacts
everyday functioning abilities such as medication adherence, financial management, and
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Ettenhofer and colleagues (2009) recruited
431 adults with HIV and examined whether cognitive functioning could predict medication
adherence, as measured by microchip-embedded pill bottle caps. Those who were older (50+
years) were more adherent to their ART regimens; however, when examining which
cognitive abilities were associated with poorer medication adherence in the older group,
deficits in executive functioning, motor functioning, and speed of processing were all found
to be predictive.
Driving difficulties have also been observed in adults with HIV. In a sample of 42 adults
with HIV and 21 adults without HIV, Marcotte and colleagues (2006) examined whether a
specific measure of speed of processing and attention, the Useful Field of View (UFOV®)
Test, was predictive of driving impairments in adults with HIV. These researchers found that
adults with HIV experienced poorer performance on the UFOV® Test and other
neuropsychological measures; the deficits were also predictive of more automobile
accidents.
Deficits in other everyday functioning activities, such as IADLs, have also been found in
adults with HIV. Vance, Wadley, Crowe, Raper, and Ball (2011) compared cognitive and
everyday functioning with a group of 201 older and younger adults with and without HIV
(M = 45.25; SD = 7.61; range = 23.67–66.92). Age by HIV status interactions were
observed on five cognitive measures, which demonstrated pronounced cognitive deficits in
older adults with HIV. Also, poorer cognitive performance predicted poorer performance on
the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Test (TIADL), which is a speeded
measure of everyday functioning.
Cognitive Intervention
With speed of processing declines observed in adults with HIV, current training techniques
used in the normal older adult population may also prove to be effective in improving
performance in adults with HIV. Such cognitive training techniques become especially
germane because the number of older adults with HIV is dramatically increasing (Kirk &
Goetz, 2009), and older adults with HIV may be particularly vulnerable for developing
speed of processing deficits (Baldewicz et al., 2004; Reger et al., 2002). Such behavioral

interventions may be more advantageous than pharmaceutical interventions given the extant
pill burden among those with HIV as well as metabolic and potential drug interactions with
HIV medications (Kirk & Goetz, 2009; Vance, Mugavero, Willig, Raper, & Saag, 2011).
Speed of processing training, a type of cognitive remediation therapy, has been developed
and studied extensively in older adults (Ball, Edwards, & Ross, 2007). Speed of processing
training is computerized and easy to use; it has resulted in marked improvements in those
who undergo cognitive remediation. In this intervention, participants play various computer
games designed to tap into speed of processing and visual attention, such as identifying a
central and peripheral stimuli on the screen. The task becomes more difficult: the inspection
time of the stimuli is reduced as the participant correctly completes the task. Thus, the
intervention is tailored to each participant’s level of performance. Older adults who have
undergone such training have demonstrated improved speed of processing, sustained visual
attention (Ball et al., 2002), and faster complex reaction time (Roenker, Cissell, Ball,
Wadley, & Edwards, 2003). This training has also demonstrated transfer to better self-
reported health (Wolinsky et al., 2006), fewer health expenditures (Wolinsky, Mahncke, et
al., 2009), reduced risk of depression (Wolinsky, Vander Weg, et al., 2009), and improved
internal locus of control for cognitive-specific abilities in older adults (Wolinsky et al.,
2010). Also, older adults who have undergone training demonstrate improved performance
on IADL tasks (Ball, Edwards, & Ross, 2007), improved driving safety via fewer dangerous
maneuvers (Roenker et al., 2003), and 50% reduced risk of at-fault crashes (Ball, Edwards,
Ross, & McGwin, 2010). Some of these transfer effects have been maintained across a 5-
year period. Because speed of processing training has repeatedly been effective in older
adults, it may also improve cognitive functioning in middle-age and older adults with HIV
(Vance, Wadley, et al., 2011).
Summary
Altogether, the literature has suggested that adults aging with HIV may be at risk for speed
of processing decrements. Furthermore, speed of processing declines may translate to poorer
performance on several everyday activities such as medication adherence, performance of
IADLs, and driving. Given the growing prevalence of adults and older adults living with
HIV in the United States, examining speed of processing declines in this population has
significant public health implications, particularly with regard to driving safety. While there
is much evidence in the literature on speed of processing declines and their translation to
everyday functioning in adults with HIV, based on a thorough search of the literature, no
studies have examined non-pharmaceutical speed of processing interventions for this
population. Given the efficacy of this type of intervention in older adults without HIV and
the vulnerability of this cognitive domain in adults aging with HIV, our study applied
computerized speed of processing intervention to a sample of adults with HIV in order to fill
in the gaps in the literature and address a relevant and emerging public health issue.
Purpose
The feasibility of speed of processing training in middle-age and older adults with HIV was
tested in a translational pilot study with three aims. Aim 1 was to determine whether speed
of processing training, which has traditionally been used in community-dwelling older
adults, would be effective in improving speed of processing performance in middle-age and
older adults with HIV. Prior studies in cognitive aging have indicated that older adults who
received speed of processing training made significant improvements in their speed of
processing abilities (Ball et al., 2007). Even when speed of processing training was as brief
as 10 1-hr sessions, improvements in speed of processing were robust over several years
(Ball et al., 2002). Therefore, it was hypothesized that speed of processing training would
benefit adults with HIV to improve this cognitive ability compared to those who did not

receive such training. Aim 2 was to determine if speed of processing training would also
transfer to a laboratory measure of everyday functioning (i.e., TIADL Test). It was
hypothesized that participants who received speed of processing training would improve on
the TIADL Test compared to those who did not receive such training. Finally, as this was a
pilot and feasibility study, Aim 3 was to examine the attrition trends of this sample as well
as subjective perceptions of improvement in this intervention group.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited through a larger R03 study designed to examine
neuropsychological differences between younger and older adults with and without HIV.
Participants with HIV infection were recruited through the university’s HIV clinic through
brochures, flyers, and word of mouth (i.e., snowball sampling) as is typical of HIV studies.
Participants were telephone screened to ensure they met study eligibility criteria. The
inclusion criteria included: participants being at least 40 years of age, proficient in English,
and having been diagnosed with HIV for at least 1 year. Changes in brain metabolism are
observed in adults with HIV even after only 1 year of being diagnosed (Lentz et al., 2011).
Exclusion criteria included: being homeless, mentally impaired (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease,
dementia, mental retardation, brain damage), deaf or blind, undergoing chemotherapy or
radiation, having experienced brain trauma with loss of consciousness for greater than 30
minutes, and having any other significant neuromedical co-morbidities (e.g., schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder). Medical chart extraction confirmed that participants did not have these
neuromedical co-morbidities. These exclusions were similar to other neurocognitive studies
of HIV and safeguarded against neuropsychological problems that could obscure the effects
of HIV and aging on otherwise normal cognitive functioning.
Design and Procedure
After completion of telephone screening in which study eligibility criteria were confirmed, a
baseline in-person appointment at the research center was scheduled with each participant
for the neuropsychological battery administration. Participants signed institutional review
board (IRB) for human use-approved consent forms at the initial visit. Participants were
compensated $50 by mail for their time and effort. Immediately after the appointment, only
the older adults with HIV (40+ years) were informed about the training study. Age 40 and
older was chosen because subtle cognitive deficits in HIV may begin to emerge in adults
around this age (Vance, Wadley et al., 2011); therefore, older adults with HIV may benefit
more from speed of processing training compared to younger adults with HIV who have less
impairment due to the interaction of age with HIV. If they were willing to participate,
participants signed another IRB-approved consent form for the current intervention study.
At this point, participants were randomized to either the speed of processing training group
or to the no-contact control group. Those in the speed of processing training group were
asked to return to the research center for additional study appointments and were instructed
how to use the training protocol. In order to minimize attrition, participants were
compensated $10 for each 1-hour training session up to 10 hours. Upon completing the
speed of processing training, participants were scheduled for an abbreviated version of the
baseline assessment. Again, participants were compensated $50 by mail for their time and
effort for this second (posttest) assessment.
Those participants randomly assigned to the no-contact control group were contacted
approximately 5 weeks after the baseline appointment to schedule a posttest assessment. In
studying speed of processing training in older adults, Wadley and colleagues (2006) found

that those assigned to a no-contact control group performed similarly to a social-contact
Internet training group.
Intervention
The speed of processing training was self-administered with a touch-screen monitor using
the Posit Science “INSIGHT” computer program (www.positscience.com). Participants
watched an initial presentation provided by the program that gave them a basic rationale and
instructions about the training protocol. The five games that were used to improve the
participants’ visual speed of processing included Bird Safari, Jewel Diver, Road Tour,
Sweep Seeker, and Master Gardener. Although each game varied slightly in stimuli
presentation and in specific task completion, all shared the same visually-based speed
component that became increasingly difficult (faster). Participants responded by identifying
either what object they saw or where they saw it (location on the screen). In this gaming
platform, if participants responded correctly, they would earn points and would receive a
pleasant sound; if participants responded incorrectly, they would not receive points and
would receive a clunking sound. In all of the games, the program would respond either by
making the exercise easier if the participants were consistently missing the answers or by
making it more difficult if they were consistently answering correctly. This double staircase
process ensured that participants were always operating near their threshold abilities of
visual speed of processing. By operating at near threshold ability, the goal of the program
designers was that participants would then stretch and increase this cognitive ability.
Participants were allowed to play all of the games, but they were encouraged to spend most
of their time on the Road Tour game. Road Tour most closely approximated the traditional
speed of processing training method used in earlier research (Ball et al., 2007). The basic
parameters for this specific type of speed of processing training protocol have been
described elsewhere (e.g., Ball et al., 2002).
Instruments
Demographic Questionnaire
An experimenter-generated measure was used to gather data on background characteristics.
These included gender, ethnicity, age, education, and income.
Health Information
An experimenter-generated measure was used to assess health-related information such as
number of prescribed medications. Specific questions concerning HIV were also asked,
including years diagnosed with HIV, current HIV viral load, and current CD4+ T
lymphocyte count. This information was verified with patient medical chart database
extraction where nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count was also determined. In general,
participant self-reports of HIV viral load (r = .56, p = .008) and CD4+ lymphocyte count (r
= .75, p < .001) were quite accurate; when there were discrepancies, information from the
medical charts was used.
Addiction Severity Index
The Addiction Severity Index, a widely accepted and gold standard measure of alcohol and
drug use, was used to compare the severity of drug and alcohol use in our sample. Questions
are used to survey the amount and type of alcohol and drug use. Composite scores are
created for alcohol and drug use; higher scores indicate greater addiction severity. Inter-rater
reliability is quite high for the alcohol (r = 0.88) and drug use (r = 0.89) composites. Test-
retest within 3 days showed no significant differences (p > .10; McLellan et al., 1992).

Cognitive Measures
Three cognitive measures and one functional measure were administered at baseline and
posttest. These tests were: the UFOV®, the Finger Tapping Test, Wisconsin Card Sorting
Test, and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. These measures were used as
outcome measures to determine the efficacy of the intervention.
Useful Field of View (UFOV®) Test—The UFOV® Test is a measure of visual speed of
processing. It is administered on a computer monitor with touch-screen technology with four
increasingly complex subtests. For each subtest, several presentations ranging from 17 to
500 milliseconds are displayed in order to determine the speed in which visual information
is processed. For subtest 1, participants are instructed to identify a central target (truck or
car) presented in a fixation box. For subtest 2, participants are instructed to identify the
central target and to locate a simultaneously presented peripheral target (car). For subtest 3,
participants are instructed to do the same activity as in the second subtest, except that the
peripheral target is now embedded in distractors, making the task more difficult. For subtest
4, the central box now has two objects (truck and/or car); participants are instructed to
determine whether the two objects in the central field are the same (truck, truck; car, car) or
different (truck, car), as well as to locate a peripheral object (car) embedded in the
surrounding clutter. For each subtest, a double staircase method is used to determine the
presentation speed in which participants correctly complete the task 75% of the time. The
optimal presentation speed is the score in milliseconds. The optimal presentation speed for
all four subtests is combined; fewer milliseconds to correctly perceive the target reflect a
faster visual speed of processing. An association coefficient between 0.74 and 0.81 indicates
good test-retest reliability (Edwards, Vance, et al., 2005).
Finger Tapping Test—The Finger Tapping Test is a widely used psychomotor test that
measures how quickly a participant can tap a finger in 10 seconds averaged over 5
consecutive trials for each hand; from this, the average is taken. The score used in this study
was the overall average across both hands. Higher average number of taps is indicative of
better psychomotor performance. This test is highly reliable for men (r = 0.94) and women (r
= 0.86; Spreen & Strauss, 1998).
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test—Computer version 4 was used in our study. The
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test is a computerized test of executive functioning whereby
participants are required to sort cards according to different principles (color, form, or
number) during test administration. After matching a response card to a stimulus card, the
participant is told whether the choice is correct or incorrect. The participant continues card
matching until 10 cards in a row are matched, and the computer then surreptitiously changes
the sorting principle and the participant needs to figure out the principle; there are 6 possible
categories to complete. In this computer version, once a participant has completed all 6
categories, the test terminates. If the participant does not complete all 6, the computer
terminates the test after 128 trials. In our study, the total percentage of correct responses was
used as the score. This test is highly related to other measures of executive functioning and
has modest test-retest reliability of 0.56 after 1 year. (Lineweaver, Bondi, Thomas, &
Salmon, 1999).
Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL)
The TIADL is a laboratory measure of everyday functioning. Specifically, it measures both
the time needed to complete 5 normal activities that one typically does in life and the
accuracy with which those activities are completed. These 5 activities include finding 2 food
items on a shelf of food, using coins to count out correct change, finding the telephone
number of a person in a telephone book, finding and reading the directions on a medicine

bottle, and finding ingredients on a can of food. For each activity, the amount of time
(seconds) necessary to complete each activity is used as the score. If a participant is unable
to complete the activity within the pre-set limit (e.g., 2 minutes), the activity is then halted
and the participant is prescribed the maximum preset time limit as the score for that activity.
If a participant completes the activity within the pre-set time limit but does so incorrectly, a
time penalty is added. This time penalty is one standard deviation of time that is derived
from the scores of those participants who completed that activity within the pre-set time
limit. The final time scores are transformed into a z-score for all 5 activities in order to
provide a TIADL composite score; such standardization ensures that the activities are
equally weighted. Because z-scores are used, composite scores can be expressed in negative
and positive coefficients; lower composite scores indicate better performance on this test.
This measure has good test-retest reliability (r = .64; Owsley, Sloane, McGwin, & Ball,
2002).
Exit Survey
This experimenter-generated measure was used to assess participants’ perceptions about
whether the intervention improved their mental function. Specifically, this survey includes
questions about what the participants did and did not like about the training, as well as
whether they felt the training improved a variety of cognitive domains as well as overall
mental functioning.
Data Analysis
Data were examined using SPSS 14. Descriptive and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
were used to examine group differences from baseline to posttest; baseline performance was
used as the covariate. Assumptions of normality, homogeneity of variance, and linearity
were satisfied using ANCOVAs to test for treatment effects. Alpha was set at p < .05.
Incidents of missing data were rare (1 for Finger Tapping Test at baseline and 1 for posttest,
1 for Wisconsin Card Sorting Test at posttest); because of these rare events, list-wise
deletion was used in the following analyses rather than imputing the data.
Results
Demographics and Differences between Groups
The average age of the sample was 51.55 years (SD = 7.38). The age ranges for the two
groups were very similar (no-contact control group age range = 41.11–70.64; speed of
processing training group age range = 40.71–69.95). Twenty-seven (58.7%) participants
were Caucasian and 19 (41.3%) were African American. Thirty-four (73.9%) of the
participants were men. No significant baseline differences were detected between the no-
contact control group and the speed of processing group on any of the demographic or HIV
variables (age, race, education level, years diagnosed with HIV, current CD4+ T lymphocyte
count, nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count, number of prescribed medications, being prescribed
ART medications, and addiction severity; see Table 1). Because there were no group
differences found between the training and control groups for demographic and HIV
variables, only baseline performance was used as a covariate. Furthermore, there were no
significant baseline differences between the groups on the neuropsychological measures or
the TIADL measure (p-values not shown).
In general, the sample was moderately healthy as exhibited by average current CD4+ T
lymphocyte counts between 200 and 500 cells/mm3. A CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 200
cells/mm3 or lower is indicative of AIDS; however, in the total sample, six (13.04%) had a
current CD4+ T lymphocyte count of 200 cells/mm3 or lower. Forty-four (95.65%)
participants had been prescribed HIV antiretroviral medication. Likewise, an HIV viral load

less than 50 copies/mL (aka, “undetectable”) is a marker of excellent HIV viral suppression,
which is attributed to ART (Kirton, 2001). In our sample, 14 (30.43%) participants had an
undetectable viral load.
Nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte count is very important from a neurological perspective. Studies
have indicated that once the CD4+ T lymphocyte count drops below 200 cells/mm3
(diagnostic for AIDS), irreparable damage to the nervous system including the brain occurs,
which is expressed as poorer cognitive functioning. Much of this damage persists even when
ART allows the immune system to reconstitute with CD4+ T lymphocytes that far exceed
200 cells/mm3 (Robertson et al., 2007). In our sample, 12 no-contact control participants
and 12 speed of processing participants (52.17% of the total sample) had a nadir CD4+ T
lymphocyte count of less than 200 cells/mm3; these data suggest that a substantial number
may have had more profound neurological damage due to HIV. However, since there was an
equal proportion of the training and control groups with nadir CD4+ T lymphocyte counts
below 200 cells/mm3, this was justification for not controlling for this variable.
Training Effects
Participants randomized to the speed of processing group spent between 2 and 10 hours (M
= 9.32, SD = 2.21) on the intervention. Table 2 displays the neuropsychological and TIADL
mean scores. Baseline to posttest group differences were not detected for the Wisconsin
Card Sorting Test, F(1, 42) = 0.40, p = .53, power = .10. Differences were detected on
UFOV® Test, F(1, 43) = 4.29, p = .04, power = .53; TIADL Test, F(1, 43) = 5.02, p = .03,
power = .59; and the Finger Tapping Test, F(1, 42) = 6.35, p = .02, power = .69.
Specifically, participants in the speed of processing training group experienced improved
speed of processing, via the UFOV® Test, and improved everyday functioning, via the
TIADL Test. Regarding the Finger Tapping Test, surprisingly, those in the no-contact
control group experienced slight improvements in this measure of psychomotor speed.
Attrition and Perceptions of Improvement
Originally, 58 HIV-infected adults ages 40 years and older were randomized to one of the
two conditions; however, 12 were lost to attrition. Differential attrition was not predicted by
group assignment (p > .05). The loss represented an attrition rate of 19.30% over a 5- to 6-
week period. Exact reasons for attrition are not well documented because most of the
participants never responded to letters or telephone messages; in many cases, their phones
were disconnected.
Of those 22 who completed the intervention arm, participants were asked, “Do you feel
playing these games improved your: (a) mental abilities, (b) memory, (c) attention, and (d)
speed of processing?” Responses ranged from 1 (not all) to 5 (extremely). Most participants
reported that they felt the training had improved their functioning moderately or better on
mental abilities (n = 20; 90.90%), memory (n = 20; 90.90%), speed of processing (n = 20;
90.90%), and attention (n = 21; 95.45%).
Discussion
The purpose of our study was to examine the efficacy and feasibility of using a well-known
cognitive remediation therapy from the gerontology literature (i.e., speed of processing
training) and translating it to a new clinical population (i.e., middle-age and older adult with
HIV) in which speed of processing deficits had been well documented. For Aim 1, we found
that the participants who received the speed of processing training improved on the UFOV®
Test, a visual speed of processing measure, compared to the no-contact control group.
Likewise for Aim 2, we found that these same participants improved on the TIADL Test, a

speeded everyday functioning task. It was not surprising that the training effects did not
transfer to the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, a measure of executive functioning, as it has
been shown that this speed of processing intervention may not transfer to other cognitive
domains (Ball et al., 2002). Regarding the Finger Tapping Test, because this intervention
was not a psychomotor intervention, it was not surprising that training did not have a
beneficial effect on this measure. The fact that the control group significantly improved on
this measure was unexpected; however, this could simply have been due to measurement
error or situational differences between participants such as fatigue and motivation.
Regardless, findings concerning the speed of processing training were encouraging and
paralleled findings in the larger gerontology literature that has also demonstrated that
intervention can improve UFOV® and TIADL performance in HIV-uninfected community-
dwelling older adults.
Clinical Implications
Given that the findings of our study reflect those in the gerontology literature, this
intervention may prove to be a cost-effective and medically non-invasive technique for
helping many adults with HIV suffering from neurological sequelae to improve cognitive
and everyday functioning. Other gerontology studies using speed of processing training have
shown improvements in health-related quality of life, driving simulator performance, on-the-
road driving behavior, and locus of control (Ball et al., 2007). The intervention simply
requires a touch-screen monitor or mouse and monitor, computer, and speed of processing
software. Many patients experiencing speed of processing deficits may be able to self-
administer treatment in the privacy of their own homes. Thus, this could give nurse
practitioners and clinicians a ready-made computer program to dispense to patients.
Although additional testing with larger samples is needed to test these conclusions in people
living with HIV, our findings support a very realistic and feasible intervention that may
improve cognitive and everyday functioning and thus augment quality of life.
Our study also has implications for health care providers, including nurses, nurse
practitioners, and physicians. Cognitive and neuropsychological problems associated with
HIV have been well documented in the literature; in fact, 30% to 60% of adults with HIV
experience cognitive impairments at some point in the illness (Thames et al., 2011).
Unfortunately, few interventions, especially behavioral interventions, have been attempted
to improve cognitive functioning in patients with HIV (Vance, Fazeli, Moneyham, Keltner,
& Raper, in press). Our study demonstrates that cognitive functioning can be improved
through cognitive remediation therapy, specifically speed of processing training, but other
cognitive remediation programs that focus on memory, reasoning, and global cognition may
also be effective. In addition, other techniques for improving cognition in adults with HIV,
such as physical exercise, intellectual stimulation, improved nutrition and sleep hygiene,
reduced alcohol and substance use, and treatment of depression and mood disturbances, may
also yield positive results. In fact, Vance, Eagerton, Harnish, McKie-Bell, and Fazeli (2011)
suggested that cognitive prescriptions, a behavioral technique to improve a host of lifestyle
factors (i.e., physical exercise, sleep hygiene, treatment for depression), may be used to
ameliorate cognitive dysfunction in populations susceptible to neuropsychological problems.
Such cognitive prescriptions to improve cognitive functioning in adults with HIV may also
prove helpful; however, more data are needed to determine if this approach is feasible and
effective in people living with HIV infection. Yet, such approaches provide clinicians with
insights into how to intervene to improve cognitive functioning in this population, especially
as they grow older and are more vulnerable to age-related cognitive declines (Vance,
Wadley, et al., 2011).

Strengths and Limitations
All studies have limitations; this study was not without exception. First, attrition was rather
high in this study, at nearly 20%. The reasons for this were not obvious because it was not
possible to get in touch with the participants who dropped out of the study. Anecdotally, it
was suspected that many of the participants were indigent and may have been living in
chaotic environments that could have kept them from having consistent access to a working
phone or transportation in order to fully participate in this study. Second, the study was
based upon a small sample; however, because significance was found even with such a small
sample, this suggested that speed of processing training may be a very robust intervention.
Third, many participants reported that they felt the speed of processing training improved
their mental functioning, but these results may have reflected social desirability. Fourth,
future studies would benefit from having a social-contact control group and perhaps an
alternative therapy for comparison with the speed of processing training. Fifth, two of the
outcome measures (WCST and TIADL) had relatively low to moderate test-retest reliability.
Further work is also needed to examine neurological mechanisms (i.e., neurogenesis, brain
derived neurotropic factor) that can produce cognitive changes in response to training.
Finally, it was not clear how or why those in the no-contact control group improved on the
Finger Tapping Test; however, the change was very small and may have been a statistical
artifact. This point was further compromised by not correcting for alpha inflation due to the
small sample size in our pilot study; alpha inflation in such a small sample is generally not
considered because it can be too restrictive.
Conclusion
Although ART has extended the lives of many people infected with HIV, neurological
sequelae are a common occurrence, especially as people age with this disease. By 2015,
nearly half of people with HIV will be 50 and older (Kirk & Goetz, 2009); this means that
nurses and other clinicians will need to address the cognitive problems that will emerge in
many of their patients (Vance, Fazeli, et al., in press). Therefore, it is imperative to find
affordable and effective strategies to ameliorate or compensate for cognitive losses. Non-
pharmaceutical approaches are favored because of the detrimental impact of pill burden and
the renal, kidney, and liver diseases common in this clinical population (Vance, Mugavero,
et al., 2011). Cognitive remediation therapy, such as speed of processing training, represents
one possible tool that may be used in conjunction with lifestyle changes (e.g., increased
physical activity, depression reduction) to develop individualized cognitive prescriptions
designed to improve and maintain cognitive health of people as they age with HIV (Vance,
Eagerton, et al., 2011).

Clinical Considerations
• Adults aging with HIV may be at risk for cognitive declines, especially in speed
of processing, which can affect everyday functional abilities.
• A cognitive intervention may improve speed of processing and everyday
functional abilities in middle-age and older adults with HIV.
• While further research is needed, nurses should be aware of potential cognitive
disturbances in this at-risk population and consider feasible intervention
strategies, such as cognitive remediation therapy.
