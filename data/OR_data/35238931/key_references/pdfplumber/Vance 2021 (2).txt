order (HAND). Fortunately, cognitive training programs can improve function across cognitive IADLs;speedofprocessing
domains, which may translate to everyday functioning. The Training on Purpose (TOPS) Study was
designed to reverse HAND by targeting cognitive training to specific cognitive impairments that
contributed to the diagnosis. A secondary aim of TOPS was to determine whether such cognitive
training improved subjective and objective everyday functioning. In this two-group pre–post
experimental design study, 109 adults with HAND were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact
control group (no training) or (2) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group. Each par-
ticipant received approximately 10hours of cognitive training in two selected cognitive domains
based on her/his individual baseline cognitive performance. Thus, 20hours of individualized train-
ing on these two cognitive domains occurred over a course of 12weeks in 1–2hour sessions.
Specific to the secondary aim of TOPS, measures of everyday functioning were administered
before and after cognitive training to examine transfer effects. The analyses revealed that in gen-
eral, speed of processing training produced benefits in everyday functioning as measured by the
medication adherence visual analogue scale and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
test. Inconsistent findings were found for the other seven cognitive training protocols in either
improving everyday functioning or reducing perceived everyday functioning; however, there may
beothercontributing factors that obscuredsuch effects needing further research. This studydem-
onstrated that some training protocols vary in efficacy in altering both objective and subjective
everydayfunctioningability.
