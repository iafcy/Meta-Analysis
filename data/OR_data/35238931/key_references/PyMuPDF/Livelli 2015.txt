The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the efﬁcacy and stability over time of
a cognitive rehabilitation protocol (restorative and compensatory approach) in HIV/AIDS
patients with HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). At baseline, 32 HIV/AIDS
patients (16 with and 16 without HAND) were assessed with a neuropsychological
battery (i.e., pre-assessment) consisting of 22 tests covering eight cognitive domains.
Then, the experimental group was administered over 4 months a cognitive rehabilitation
protocol aimed at improving four cognitive domains by means of eight paper and
pencil/computer-based exercises. The control group received guideline-adherent clinical
care (i.e., standard of care). At the end of the cognitive treatment, both groups were
re-administered the neuropsychological battery (i.e., post-assessment). Additionally,
6 months after post-assessment, the experimental group was given the same
neuropsychological battery (i.e., follow up-assessment). In order to test the efﬁcacy
of the cognitive rehabilitation protocol, we compared between groups the results of
the neuropsychological battery at the pre- and post-assessments. In order to evaluate
the stability over time, the effects of the cognitive rehabilitation protocol was examined
comparing within the experimental group the results of the neuropsychological battery
at post- and follow up-assessments. Our results show that the two groups did
not differ at the pre-assessment, but differed at post-assessment. Speciﬁcally, the
experimental group showed a signiﬁcant improvement in ﬁve domains (Learning and
memory, Abstraction/executive functioning, Verbal ﬂuency, Attention/working memory,
and Functional), whereas the control group signiﬁcantly worsened in the same domains.
The improvement of the experimental group did not change in the follow up-assessment
in two domains (Abstraction/executive functioning, Attention/working memory, and
Functional). Overall, these ﬁndings support the efﬁcacy and, to some extent, the stability
over time of our cognitive rehabilitation protocol.

Cognitive Rehabilitation Intervention in HIV
INTRODUCTION
Combination antiretroviral therapy has extended the survival of
patients living with Human Immunodeﬁciency Virus (HIV) and,
as a result, HIV is becoming a chronic disease. At the same
time, however, patients appear to be more commonly aﬀected
by physical, social and cognitive disabilities (e.g., O’Brien et al.,
2014) than the general population. For instance, in a population-
based sample of people living with HIV, over 80% of patients
reported at least one impairment, activity limitation or social
participation restriction (Rusch et al., 2004). One of the most
common causes of disability is HIV-associated Neurocognitive
Disorder (HAND; Heaton et al., 2010). The largest HAND
study to date reported deﬁcits in 52% of HIV-seropositive adults
(Heaton et al., 2010). Since, these disabilities can aﬀect clinical
outcomes, cognitive rehabilitation may be a key step in the
maintenance or improvement of quality of life of HIV patients.
Consensus research criteria for classifying HAND were
published in 2007 (Antinori et al., 2007). Speciﬁcally, the authors
proposed
three
categories:
Asymptomatic
Neurocognitive
Impairment (ANI), Mild Neurocognitive Disorder (MND), and
HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD). The taxonomy is based on
objective diagnostic criteria and account for daily functioning.
The diagnosis of mild (MND) or severe (HAD) symptomatic
HAND, for instance, requires a functional decline in at least two
cognitive domains.
While the incidence of HAD has been reduced with
combination antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of less severe
forms of neurocognitive disorders (i.e., ANI and MND) has
remained relatively stable. Further, a large longitudinal study
found that both ANI and MND were associated with cognitive
worsening (Grant et al., 2014). One explanation for the
persistence of mild HAND is antiretroviral neurotoxicity (Giunta
et al., 2011; Robertson et al., 2012). Such toxicity may occur via
direct drug eﬀects on neurons and glia or indirectly via drug-
linked eﬀects on other organs, such as the cardiovascular system
(Underwood et al., 2015).
The development of treatments for HAND is an important
unmet clinical need. With regard to cognitive rehabilitation,
three studies have been published to date (Boivin et al., 2010;
Becker et al., 2012; Vance et al., 2012) but none employed
HAND diagnoses as inclusion criteria and all used the so-called
restorative approach that aims to restore the neural circuits
underlying impaired cognitive processes by means of practice
and focused training exercises. These studies reported positive
eﬀects on visual learning (Boivin et al., 2010) and speed of
information processing (Boivin et al., 2010; Vance et al., 2012).
However, the improvement did not extend to other ecologically
relevant cognitive domains, such as executive functioning or
working memory, and the durability of the beneﬁts was not
strongly addressed.
In the present study, we aimed to examine the eﬃcacy and
durability of a cognitive rehabilitation treatment for HAND
in HIV+ adults taking suppressive antiretroviral therapy. To
maximize the ecological impact of the training, our intervention
combined the restorative approach of prior studies with the
compensatory approach known to better enable learning of new
strategies and minimizing the impact of remaining impairment
(Robertson and Murre, 1999; Cicerone et al., 2005; Dams-
O’Connor et al., 2009). We predicted a signiﬁcant improvement
of the neuropsychological picture in HAND-treated, respect
to HAND-untreated patients. Additionally, we predicted the
stability over time of these eﬀects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Thirty-two patients (16 with and 16 without HAND) in
care to the Infectious Disease Unit “Division A,” Amedeo
of Savoia Hospital (Turin, Italy) provided written informed
consent to participate in the study, which was approved by
the Local Bioethics Committee (ASL TO2). The study did not
include any pharmacological intervention, and it was performed
in accordance with the ethical standards described in the
Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, 2013).
Patients were randomized 1:1 to either the experimental
group or the control group. The two groups did not diﬀer in
demographic, clinical, or treatment characteristics (all p > 0.05,
see Table 1).
Both
groups
were
administered
a
pre-assessment
neuropsychological battery (see below). Then, the experimental
group was given the cognitive rehabilitation intervention
for 4 months (see below for the full description) and the
control group was given standard of care. At the end of
the cognitive treatment, both groups were re-administered
(post-assessment)
the
neuropsychological
battery.
The
experimental group was also given the neuropsychological
battery 6 months after the post-assessment (follow up) in
a within-subjects randomized order. Raw scores on each

Sixty of 110 tested patients (54%) were diagnosed with HAND (48
ANI, 10 MND, and 2 HAD). Participants (N = 32) were selected
among those with HAND based on speciﬁc eligibility criteria:
receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months, plasma
HIV RNA below 50 copies/mL for at least 6 months, CD4+ T
lymphocyte count above 350 cells/µ L from at least 6 months,
ﬂuent Italian speaker, and absence of severe comorbidities,
including neurodegenerative or psychiatric disease, metabolic
encephalopathy, psychoactive drug use, alcohol use, or head
trauma.
Cognitive Rehabilitation Treatment
The cognitive rehabilitation protocol included both paper-
and-pencil and computer-based exercises and it was composed
of eight diﬀerent exercises repeated in 36 sessions (around
50 min each) over 4 months. The eight tests were administered
in a randomized-within subjects order. The protocol aimed
at improving with the diﬀerent group of tests four cognitive
domains:
• Attention
◦Time Pressure Management (Fasotti et al., 2000)
■Five minute paper-and-pencil exercise to improve
functional impairments related to slowed information
processing
and
complex
attention.
Patients
learn
compensatory strategies as, for instance, allowing
suﬃcient time to manage a task
◦Attention Process Training Task (Cicerone et al., 2005)
■Five
minute
paper-and-pencil
exercise
organized
hierarchically to improve diﬀerent components of
attention: sustained, selective, alternating and divided
attention. Patients learn compensatory strategies as,
for instance, removing environmental distractors or
employing using cues to maintain attention
• Visual-verbal memory and learning
◦COG.I.T.O. (open platform. ASPHI and San Camillo
Hospital, Turin
■Ten
minute
computer-based
exercise
to
improve
attention/visual-spatial memory. Patients have to encode
daily-use objects in domestic environments (i.e., kitchen,
bedroom, garage). Then, objects disappear and they
have to put them back in their correct location, or
recognizing them among distractors and relocating
them, or writing their names and relocating them. From
session to session, the available time decreases whereas
the number of objects increases.

◦Goal Management Training (Levine et al., 2000)
■Five minute paper-and-pencil exercise to improve the
ability to stop and think about what one is doing,

• Metacognitive Awareness
◦Increased Awareness (10 min)
■One minute at the beginning of each session, 1 min at the
end of each exercise for 10 min to improve awareness of
neurocognitive deﬁcits (Dams-O’Connor and Gordon,
2010).
RESULTS
Raw corrected scores on each neuropsychological test at pre
pre-, post-, and follow up- were standardized (T-score). When
necessary, the standard scores were reversed in order to keep the
interpretation of all tests in the same direction, namely higher
scores reﬂecting a better performance. Then the standard scores
were averaged within each domain.
In order to evaluate the eﬃcacy of the cognitive rehabilitation
protocol, we performed a repeated measures ANOVA on
each domain of the neuropsychological battery with the mean
standard scores as dependent variables, TIME (two levels:
pre-assessment, post-assessment) as within-subjects factor, and
GROUP (two levels: experimental, control) as between-subjects
factor.
Respect to “Screening,” the TIME x group interaction resulted
to be signiﬁcant [F(1, 30)
=
7.05, p
=
0.013]. Post-hoc
comparisons (Duncan) revealed that the two groups did not
diﬀer at pre-assessment (experimental group: mean = 50.23,
SE = 1.32; control group: mean = 49.77, SE = 1.31), but

mean = 53.3, SE = 1.74; control group: mean = 46.7, SE = 1.74);
see Figure 1. The analysis on “Speed information processing”
was not signiﬁcant. As regards “Learning and memory,” the
TIME × GROUP interaction was signiﬁcant [F(1, 30) = 31.58,
p < 0.0001]. Post-hoc comparisons (Duncan) revealed that the
two groups did not diﬀer at pre-assessment (experimental group:
mean = 51.11, SE = 1.96; control group: mean = 48.89, SE =
1.95), but diﬀered (p = 0.0002) at post-assessment (experimental
group: mean = 55.75, SE = 1.54; control group: mean = 44.24,
SE = 1.54) because the mean score of the experimental group
signiﬁcantly (p = 0.0005) increased and the mean score of
the control group signiﬁcantly (p = 0.0001) decreased (see
Figure 1). The TIME × GROUP interaction was signiﬁcant
[F(1, 30) = 21.42, p < 0.0001 also for “Abstraction/Executive
Functioning.” Duncan post-hoc showed that the groups did not
diﬀer at pre-assessment (experimental group: mean = 50.41,
SE = 1.9; control group: mean = 49.6, SE = 1.38), but diﬀered
(p < 0.001) at post-assessment (experimental group: mean =
54.51, SE = 1.27; control group: mean = 47.48, SE = 1.27)
because the mean score of the experimental group signiﬁcantly
(p
=
0.003) increased, and the mean score of the control
group signiﬁcantly (p = 0.003) decreased (see Figure 1). The
same was true for the “verbal ﬂuency” in which the TIME ×
GROUP interaction was signiﬁcant [F(1, 30)
=
11.45, p
=
0.002]. Duncan post-hoc analysis revealed that groups did not
diﬀer at pre-assessment (experimental group: mean = 51.95,

signiﬁcantly (p

the control group signiﬁcantly (p

Figure 1). The TIME × GROUP interaction was signiﬁcant
[F(1, 30)

=
0.001] also for “Attention/Working

not diﬀer at pre-assessment (experimental group: mean = 50.62,
SE = 1.49; control group: mean = 49.38, SE = 1.49), but
diﬀered (p = 0.0001) at post-assessment (experimental group:

signiﬁcantly (p

the control group signiﬁcantly (p

same was true for “Functional” in which the TIME × GROUP
interaction was signiﬁcant [F(1, 30) = 12.91, p = 0.001]. Duncan
post-hoc revealed that groups did not diﬀer at pre-assessment
(experimental group: mean = 49.64, SE = 2.54; control group:
mean = 50.36, SE = 2.53), but diﬀered (p = 0.042) at post-
assessment (experimental group: mean = 53.92, SE = 2.31;
control group: mean = 46.08, SE = 2.33) because the mean score
of the experimental group signiﬁcantly (p = 0.021) increased and
the mean score of the control group signiﬁcantly (p = 0.021)
decreased. The analysis on “Mental Health” was not signiﬁcant.
In order to evaluate whether the treatment was able to
induce permanent eﬀects, we performed in the experimental
group a within subject ANOVA on each domain of the
neuropsychological battery which improved from pre- to post
assessments. The mean standard scores were employed as
dependent variables, and TIME (three levels: pre-assessment,
post-assessment, follow up-assessment) as within-subjects factor.
The analysis on “Learning and Memory” (see Figure 2) resulted
to be signiﬁcant [F(2, 30)
=
8.92, p
<
0.001]. Post-hoc
comparisons (Duncan) revealed that the mean score signiﬁcantly
(p = 0.003) improved from pre- (mean = 51.1, SE = 1.94) to
post- (mean = 55.75, SE = 1.55) assessment and worsened (p <
0.001) from post- to follow up-assessment (mean = 50, SE =
2.1). Also the analysis on “Abstraction/executive functioning”
(see Figure 2) was signiﬁcant [F(2,30) = 5, p = 0.008] with
the mean score signiﬁcantly (p = 0.006) improved (Duncan)
from pre- (mean = 50.4, SE = 1.44) to post- (mean = 54.52,
SE = 0.7) assessment and worsened (p = 0.004) from post-
to follow up-assessment (mean = 50, SE = 0.9). The same
was true (see Figure 2) for “Verbal Fluency” [F(2, 30) = 5.5,
p
=
0.01) with the mean score signiﬁcantly (p
=
0.03)
improved (Duncan) from pre- (mean = 51.95, SE = 2.06) to
post- (mean = 56.67, SE = 1.07) assessment and worsened
(p
=
0.005) from post- to follow up-assessment (mean =
50, SE = 2.1). As regards “Attention/working memory” (see
Figure 2), the analysis resulted to be signiﬁcant. However,
post-hoc comparisons (Duncan) revealed that the mean score
signiﬁcantly (p = 0.03) improved from pre- (mean = 50.62, SE =
1.31) to post- (mean = 54.44, SE = 1.22) assessment but did not
change (p > 0.05) from post- to follow up-assessment (mean =
50, SE = 1.74). The analysis on “Functional” (see Figure 2) was
not signiﬁcant (p > 0.05).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we examined the eﬃcacy of a cognitive
rehabilitation protocol that included both restorative and

compensatory approaches for treatment of HAND. Our results
show discordant clinical evolution in ﬁve out of eight domains
in participants who received the intervention compared with
those who did not: treated patients improved, untreated patients
worsened. Additionally, the improvement proved to be stable
over time in four of ﬁve domains.
Within the context of HIV, rehabilitation is a dynamic set
of activities that can beneﬁt the disease as well as linked
social limitations and dysfunctions (Worthington et al., 2005).
With the graying of the HIV population, the demand for
rehabilitation services will likely increase in the near future
(O’Brien et al., 2014). Since a substantial number of HIV
patients have cognitive impairment (e.g., Heaton et al., 2010),
expansion in rehabilitation services should include cognitive
rehabilitation.
One deﬁnition of cognitive rehabilitation is a systematic,
functionally oriented set of therapeutic activities. Cognitive
improvement is achieved by both strengthening previously
learned behavioral patterns and establishing new, compensatory
ones (Bergquist and Malec, 1997). This is possible because of the
brain plasticity, the changes of brain organization that subserve
short- and long-term behavioral modiﬁability. These changes can
be structural (i.e., remodeling of the brain’s physical structures) or
physiological (i.e., dynamic adjustment of cellular processes such
as synapse formation that modulate conductance or resistance
to impulse transmission; see, for instance, Berlucchi, 2011).
These changes can include adaptation to novel environments,
maturation, diﬀerent learning types, and compensatory changes
in response to functional loss (see, for instance, Berlucchi, 2011).
Successful
cognitive
rehabilitation
treatment
typically
targets diﬀerent cognitive abilities, such as attention, memory,
perception, learning, and executive functioning. Metacognitive
awareness, emotional regulation, social skills and community
integration are other, important targets. The main aim of
cognitive rehabilitation is to signiﬁcantly reduce the impact of
disease on daily living. More speciﬁc aims depend on the nature
and severity of the individual cognitive, behavioral, physical,
and emotional diﬃculties as well as on the speciﬁc individual
premorbid achievements (Dams-O’Connor and Gordon, 2010).
With
HAND,
HIV
mainly
aﬀects
fronto-striatal-
thalamocortical circuitry, often being associated with decreased
white matter volume (e.g., Thompson et al., 2005). As a
consequence, cognitive deﬁcits can cover a wide range of
abilities. For instance, patients may develop impairments
of visual/verbal working memory (Martin et al., 2001) as a
consequence of central executive dysfunctions (Hinkin et al.,
2002). Additionally, patients may show working memory
impairments that can inﬂuence even higher-level cognitive
abilities and daily activities (Martin et al., 2004). Nonetheless,
HIV is frequently associated with diﬃculties of attentional
processes (Hinkin et al., 2002), which, in turn, may negatively
aﬀect adherence to antiretroviral therapy (Levine et al., 2005,
2008). As a result, patients can experience multiple personal and
professional diﬃculties and are frequently unemployed (Heaton
et al., 1994; van Gorp et al., 2007).
In the present study, we aimed to maximize the eﬀects of
a cognitive rehabilitation intervention by training patients in
both restorative (i.e., COG.I.T.O) and compensatory abilities
(Time
Pressure
Management,
Attention
Process
Training
Task, Errorless Learning, Process-Oriented Memory Learning,
Metacognitive Strategy Training, Goal Management Training,
Increased
Awareness).
Each
exercise
was
organized
and
administered in diﬀerent steps with progressively increasing
diﬃculty, suitable for gradual improvement of performance
and for learning of any targeted ability. As written above, we
found a signiﬁcant improvement in the experimental, respect
to the control, from pre- to post-assessments in Learning and
memory, Abstraction/executive functioning, Verbal ﬂuency,
Attention/working
memory,
and
Daily
functioning.
The
improvement in Attention/working memory indirectly suggests
beneﬁts for daily functioning (working memory) and medication
adherence (attention). The improvement in Learning and
memory could explain the improvements in self-reported IADLs
at post-assessment as well as the better work eﬃciency reported
by treated patients. In contrast, the control group signiﬁcantly
worsened in the same domains.
At follow up-assessment, the cognitive improvement were
stable (i.e., no signiﬁcant diﬀerence respect to post-assessment)
in two domains. It is worth noticing that previous long-term
(i.e., 5 months to 1 year) beneﬁts of cognitive rehabilitation
(Tesar et al., 2005; Svendsen and Teasdale, 2006; Fink et al.,
2010; Stuifbergen et al., 2012), have been related to patients
continued use of learned strategies in ecological situations, as
well as to the relevance of the intervention to the patient’s
daily functioning (Cicerone et al., 2000). Then, patients of
experimental group used learned strategies in ecological contexts
of daily living. However, in the other three domains, the
experimental group’s performance signiﬁcantly worsened (and,
indeed, this is also the overall trend). Broadly speaking, this is
not surprising but, rather, consistent with the fact that most
long-term follow up studies on the eﬀects of acquired brain
injuries show also some persisting eﬀects (Klonoﬀet al., 1993;
Dikmen et al., 2003; Wood and Rutterford, 2006). Additionally,
ARV neurotoxicity and the potential HIV activities within the
central nervous system acts against the cognitive rehabilitation
process. Indeed, this might also explain, at least in part, the above-
mentioned fact that the control group worsened from pre- to
post-assessment.
Our study had several limitations. First, the sample size
is relatively small. Hence, further studies with larger samples
are required to validate the ﬁndings. Secondly, and more
importantly, the control group was administered standard of
care only but not a structured activity, raising the possibility
that repeating per se the cognitive rehabilitation protocol
might have a role in the improvement observed in the
experimental group. This possibility is countered by the
fact that beneﬁt was not observed in all domains, which
would have been seen if the improvement was solely due to
practice. Still, this remains a limitation of our investigation
and future studies should employ active control activities
such as generalized compensatory cognitive training or low
cognitive demand computer activities (Weber et al., 2013).
Interestingly, those studies might address the eﬀects of diﬀerent
kind of interventions: restorative approaches vs. compensatory

interventions, purely computer-based vs. purely paper-based.
Beyond the presence of a control condition, such strategies
would better enable proof of concept for the use of cognitive
rehabilitation in HAND.
In conclusion, our intervention was associated with better
cognitive performance. According to a recent call to action
(Weber et al., 2013), future studies should prioritize development
of speciﬁc cognitive rehabilitation interventions for HAND,
particularly with emphasis on two issues. First, while our center is
similar to other Italian centers, a speciﬁc battery of standardized
tests for HIV populations should be developed in Italy to
generalize our ﬁndings to diﬀerent countries. Secondly, the
impact of cognitive rehabilitation on daily living, quality of life,
and medication adherence has to be clariﬁed. Since unawareness
is in general a signiﬁcant barrier to treatment (Ownsworth et al.,
2002) and since more than 50% of people with HIV have poor
insight of their cognitive deﬁcits (Weber et al., 2013), more
speciﬁc measures and more sensitive interventions should be
developed.
