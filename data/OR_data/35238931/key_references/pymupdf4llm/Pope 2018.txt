### Abstract

Cognitive impairments seen in people living with HIV (PLWH) are associated with difficulties in
everyday functioning, specifically driving. This study utilized speed of processing cognitive
remediation therapy (SOP-CRT) with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to gauge the
feasibility and impact on simulated driving. Thirty PLWH (Mage = 54.53, SD = 3.33) were
randomly assigned to either: sham tDCS SOP-CRT or active tDCS SOP-CRT. Seven indicators of
simulated driving performance and safety were obtained. Repeated measures ANOVAs controlling
for driver’s license status (valid and current license or expired/no license) revealed a large training
effect on average driving speed. Participants who received active tDCS SOP-CRT showed a slower
average driving speed (p = 0.020, d = 0.972) than those who received sham tDCS SOP-CRT. Nonsignificant small-to-medium effects were seen for driving violations, collisions, variability in lane
positioning, and lane deviations. Combination tDCS SOP-CRT was found to increase indices of
cautionary simulated driving behavior. Findings reveal a potential avenue of intervention and
rehabilitation for improving driving safety among vulnerable at-risk populations, such as those
aging with chronic disease.

### 1. Introduction

**1.1. HIV, aging, and mobility**


By the year 2020, 70% of the individuals currently living with HIV are expected to be 50
years old and older (High et al., 2012) due to medical advances such as combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART) and better knowledge and care for the disease (Sheppard et al.,
2017). Declines normally associated with the aging process are accompanied with deficits in
cognition, including processing speed, or the rate at which an individual processes and uses
information from the environment (Glisky, 2007). With HIV, the discussion of premature
aging is of interest as studies show evidence of both age-related deficits at younger ages (i.e.,
accelerated aging) and exacerbated age-related deficits in age-normative declines (i.e.,
accentuated aging; Sheppard et al., 2017). Furthermore Greene et al. (2015) found that
people living with HIV (PLWH) aged 50 and older reported high rates of geriatric
syndromes (e.g., diseases, problems, frailty, or syndromes normally associated with aging),
including impairments with mobility, cognition, and difficulties with instrumental activities
of daily living (IADL).


**1.2. Driving Rehabilitation**

One common IADL, rated high in importance for older adults, is driving. Driving is a
complex task that involves multiple cognitive, behavioral, and environmental factors
(Anstey, Wood, Lord, & Walker, 2005; Pope, Bell, & Stavrinos, 2017; Pope, Ross, &
Stavrinos, 2016). Driving cessation has been associated with a multitude of negative health
outcomes including decreased engagement in social activities (Marottoli et al., 2000), poorer
psychological well-being including higher ratings of depression and lower life satisfaction
(Siren, Hakamies-Blomqvist, & Lindeman, 2004), and declines in physical functioning
(Edwards, Lunsman, Perkins, Rebok, & Roth, 2009). Prior research has focused heavily on
clinical populations such as those living with traumatic brain injury (TBI; Ortoleva, Brugger,
Van der Linden, & Walder, 2012), dementia (Reger et al., 2004), and HIV (Marcotte et al.,
1999) as they have shown driving performance deficits that vary with disease severity when
compared to healthy controls. Specifically, for PLWH who had cognitive impairment, higher
failure rates on simulated driving scenarios, more simulated driving collisions, and higher
likelihood of being rated as unsafe on driving evaluation scores were seen when compared to
those with HIV who did not show cognitive impairment (Marcotte et al., 1999; Marcotte et
al., 2006; Marcotte et al., 2004). Furthermore, a pilot study by Vance, Fazeli, Ball, Slater,
and Ross (2014) also found a significant association between various HIV related variables
(CD4 count), self-reported driving history (days driven per week), simulated driving
performance (reaction time, speeding, divided attention), and cognitive performance (speed
of processing [SOP], attention, memory, cognitive flexibility) adding to the multifactorial
processes linked with driving.


Studies investigating the neural mechanisms underlying driving behavior and performance
suggest activation of multiple brain areas such as the pre-motor, cerebellar, and
frontoparietal areas (Graydon et al., 2004; Spiers & Maguire, 2007), depending on the
driving behavior or task at hand. One such area includes the ventral attention system, which
encompasses the temporoparietal junction and the ventral frontal cortex (Fox, Corbetta,

Transp Res Part F Traffic Psychol Behav. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 01.


-----

Snyder, Vincent, & Raichle, 2006; Vossel, Geng, & Fink, 2014) and is associated with the
salience network (Sridharan, Levitin, & Menon, 2008). Neural activation corresponds to
unexpected stimuli which diverts or cues resources away from the focus of spatial attention
(Vossel et al., 2014). Spiers and Maguire (2007) found neural evidence suggesting the
activation or role of the ventral frontal cortex during various driving maneuvres such as
turning and stopping. These findings add support for the investigation into rehabilitative
interventions that include the cognitive processes related to driving such as SOP, attention,
and cognitive control.

**1.2.1. Speed of processing cognitive remediation therapy (SOP-CRT)—An**
innovative and frequently studied form of driving rehabilitation is speed of processing
cognitive remediation therapy (SOP-CRT; Ball, Edwards, & Ross, 2007; Ball, Edwards,
Ross, & McGwin, 2010; Edwards, Myers, et al., 2009; Roenker, Cissell, Ball, Wadley, &
Edwards, 2003). This type of CRT utilizes a paradigm of visual SOP and attentional control
processes to target processing speed abilities (Ball et al., 2007). Individuals who received 10
sessions of SOP-CRT in the Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly
(ACTIVE) clinical trial (Ball et al., 2002) showed SOP training gains which were
maintained over 2 years and lower rates of at-fault motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) 6 years
after the initial training (Ball et al., 2010). Furthermore, Vance, Fazeli, Ross, Wadley, and
Ball (2012) found that SOP-CRT in PLWH was associated with better SOP and performance
on a timed IADL task at post-test when compared to the no-contact control group.


**1.2.2. Non-invasive brain simulation – Transcranial direct current stimulation**
**(tDCS)—Non-invasive brain stimulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)**
is a safe, common, and widely studied neuro-modulation technique (Ahn et al., 2017; Bikson
et al., 2016; Fazeli, Woods, Pope, Vance, & Ball, 2017; Nitsche & Paulus, 2000; Priori,
Berardelli, Rona, Accornero, & Manfredi, 1998; Szymkowicz, McLaren, Suryadevara, &
Woods, 2016; Woods et al., 2016; Woods et al., 2014). tDCS is thought to modulate cortical
neuronal membrane potentials which may alter cortical activity such as spontaneous
neuronal activity or changes in neurotransmitters (Woods et al., 2016). Sub-threshold
stimulation is administered to the scalp, targeting relevant cortical areas and neuronal
networks, yet when using conventional electrodes (in contrast to high-definition) focality is
limited and widespread effects are expected (Kessler et al., 2013; Minhas et al., 2010;
Minhas, Bikson, Woods, Rosen, & Kessler, 2012; Woods et al., 2016). Membrane
polarization and observed behavioral effects are conditional to whether stimulation is anodal
(positive charge) or cathodal (negative charge) and the specific tDCS placement (i.e.,
montage) used (Scheldrup et al., 2014; Woods et al., 2016).


The behavioral findings regarding tDCS on cognitive and motor task outcomes are mixed,
with effect sizes depending on methodological design and tDCS factors such as polarity and
selected montages (Hsu, Ku, Zanto, & Gazzaley, 2015; Jacobson, Koslowsky, & Lavidor,
2012; Nilsson, Lebedev, Rydström, & Lövdén). Less investigated, is the role of tDCS with
complex, real-world behavior such as driving (Scheldrup et al., 2014). Beeli, Koeneke,
Gasser, and Jancke (2008) showed immediate change in simulated driving performance, with
individuals who received 15 minutes (min) of 1 milliamp (mA) anodal tDCS stimulation to

the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; 10–20 international system: F3 and
F4, respectively) with the cathode placed on the ipsilateral mastoid, exhibiting overall more
cautionary driving behavior (i.e., larger headway distances, fewer speed violations, slower
driving speed, and fewer revolutions per minute). Similar findings were found by Sakai,
Uchiyama, Tanaka, Sugawara, and Sadato (2014) who showed better driving performance
(e.g., longer headway distance and better lane keeping ability) when the tDCS anode was
placed over F4 and the cathode over F3 compared to the cathode over F4 and anode over F3
as well as the sham stimulation.

**1.2.3. Combination tDCS and CRT—While the exact mechanism behind the**
alteration in neuronal activity is still unknown, combination tDCS and CRT has been a
recent popular methodological design regarding behavior change (Vance, Fazeli, Cody, Bell,
& Pope, 2016). While debated, it has been hypothesized that larger or heightened CRT or
learning effects will be observed in the presence of tDCS, as both have independently shown
evidence of neuroplasticity in healthy and clinical populations (Hill, Fitzgerald, & Hoy,
2016; Nilsson, Lebedev, Rydstrom, & Lovden, 2017; O’Brien, Lister, Peronto, & Edwards,
2015; Scheldrup et al., 2014; Takeuchi & Kawashima, 2012; Woods et al., 2016).


Regarding complex, real-world behavior, Clark et al. (2012) found that when 2.0 mA tDCS
stimulation with the anode over the right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC; 10–20 international
system: F10) and the cathode placed on the contralateral shoulder was paired with virtual
threat-identification training, immediate accuracy of identifying concealed objects was
improved compared to those receiving sham stimulation or 2mA stimulation with the anode
over the partial cortex. This combination paradigm was extended to airplane pilot training,
which found limited behavioral learning evidence, but significant changes in neural activity
of the DLPFC and primary motor cortex (Choe, Coffman, Bergstedt, Ziegler, & Phillips,
2016). In HIV-positive populations specifically, there are currently two studies investigating
combination tDCS and CRT. Ownby and Acevedo (2016) utilized a racing video game
(albeit, not a true CRT) in conjunction with 20 minutes of 1.5 mA tDCS with the anode over
F3 and the cathode placed over the right supraorbital area. Similarly, Fazeli et al. (2017), the
parent study of the current sample and procedure investigated, utilized an online SOP-CRT,
Brain HQ (Posit Science) with the same montage as Clark et al. (2012) (anode over F10 and
the cathode on contralateral shoulder). Both studies found medium-to-large effect sizes
related to training group by time interactions, but limited statistical training-related change
conceivably due to small sample sizes and lack of no-contact control groups. Regarding
driving, while cognitive training and driving simulator training in isolation has been
investigated in samples of older adults (Casutt, Martin, Keller, & Jäncke, 2014; Cuenen,
Jongen, Brijs, Brijs, Houben, et al., 2016; Cuenen, Jongen, Brijs, Brijs, Lutin, et al., 2016), it
is yet to be tested whether combination tDCS and CRT would generalize to real-world
behavior and significantly affect simulated driving performance.


**1.3. Specific aims and hypotheses**

The overall aim of the pilot study was to preliminarily investigate the feasibility and effects
of combination tDCS SOP-CRT on driving simulator outcomes in individuals aged 50 and
older living with HIV. The current study utilized data from the aforementioned Fazeli et al.,

2017 study; this parent study examined neurocognitive outcomes of tDCS SOP-CRT while
the current study examines driving simulator outcomes. This study extends the limited
existing literature on combination tDCS SOP-CRT findings in PLWH by examining this
training paradigm on an important everyday functioning outcome. It was hypothesized that
individuals who received the active tDCS SOP-CRT would show more cautionary driving
behavior (i.e., reduction in overall driving deviations, violations, collisions, less variability in
lane positioning, faster reaction time to hazards, slower speed, and less speed variability) at
post-test when compared to the sham tDCS SOP-CRT group.

### 2. Method


**2.1. Participants**

Adults 50 and older, all who were HIV-positive and from the Birmingham-metro area, were
recruited via Institutional Review Board approved flyers at a university affiliated HIV clinic
in the southeast.


All participants met the self-report inclusion criteria of: (1) being HIV-positive and a current
patient at the university affiliated HIV clinic, (2) 50 and older, (3) having a stable address
(e.g., not homeless), (4) being able to speak and understand English, (5) having no mental
impairments (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or mental retardation), (6) not being
legally blind or deaf, (7) not currently undergoing radiation or chemotherapy, (8) no history
of a brain trauma with loss of consciousness greater than 30 min, (9) no neurological
problems (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, migraines, history of stroke, epilepsy, or
history of seizures), (10) not having untreated hypertension, (11) no intracranial metal
plates, implants, or biomedical devices, and (12) being right-handed. Given that we wanted
to examine the effect of the intervention on driving behaviors in both non-current drivers as
well as current driver (regardless of whether one was a licensed driver or not), driver’s
license status was not included in the eligibility criteria. Further, as 23.3% (n = 7) of the
final sample reported driving at least one day per week without a valid driver’s license; this
confirmed the importance of examining all classifications of drivers in this sample. In efforts
to have a well representative sample, driving exposure (i.e., days driven per week and
driver’s license status) was assessed and used for further analyses. Furthermore, Blows,
Ameratunga, Ivers, Lo, and Norton (2005) found that driving without a valid driver’s license
may indicate a higher level of risk for older drivers, putting them at a possible higher risk for
MVCs.


In total, 119 individuals were screened, with 48 individuals meeting the self-report inclusion
criteria and enrolled, of which 37 completed the baseline, training, and post-test visits (see
Figure 1). After the clinic data were reconciled with self-report data after the completion of
the study, it was determined that four of the 37 did not in fact meet inclusion criteria (clinic
confirmed previous history of stroke and schizophrenia). These four participants were
excluded from the main aim analyses reported in the parent study (Fazeli et al., 2017) given
the potential effect of those conditions on cognitive functioning. The current study sample
size differs from Fazeli et al. (2017) as it includes all participants who completed the
simulated driving portion for baseline and post-test as well as the training. Given the
exploratory nature of the described pilot study, this allowed us to maximize available

simulator data to investigate the current research question. Of the 37 participants who
completed all visits, four suffered from simulator sickness and were unable to complete the
driving portion of the baseline and post-test visits, two failed the practice drive, and one
participant did not complete the simulator portion of the post-test. Compared to the total
sample, these seven individuals did not differ in demographic characteristics (p’s > 0.05),
except for on age (t (38) = −2.27, p = 0.029), with those without complete simulator data
being older in age (Myears = 58.14, SD = 6.52) than those with complete simulator data
(Myears = 54.42, SD = 3.23). The final sample consisted of 30 PLWH aged 50-63 years of
age (Mage = 54.53, SD = 3.33). Of this sample (see Table 1), the majority were African
American (86.7%), male (63.3%), and had a range of education from 9[th] grade to postsecondary education (Myears = 12.40, SD = 1.85).


**2.2. Study procedure**

Participants were screened via a 10-min telephone screener which included the inclusion
criteria previously mentioned. If eligible, participants were scheduled for a 2-hour (h)
baseline visit that involved informed consent, demographic intake, questionnaires, a
comprehensive cognitive battery, and a drive in the driving simulator. After completion of
the baseline visit, participants were randomly assigned (using a stratified randomization
algorithm that matched the two groups on age, gender, years of education, and driving risk
measured by the useful field of view [UFOV[®] task]), to a training group: sham tDCS SOPCRT (referred to as the sham training group) or active tDCS SOP-CRT (referred to as the
active training group). After group assignment, the participants were scheduled for 10 1-h
training visits that were conducted in the lab by a trained researcher that was not affiliated
with the baseline or post-test appointments, but was not blinded to the tDCS randomization.
Post-test assessments were conducted by a blinded trained research assistant to minimize
experimenter bias. These appointments were identical to baseline visits with the addition of
an exit survey on sensations from the tDCS during training as well as expectancy effects of
the training. Participants were compensated $50 for each baseline and post-test assessments,
and $10 for each 1-h training sessions ($100), for a total of $200. This study was registered
in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02391311) and has been further explained in more detail in Fazeli
et al. (2017).


Both training groups received the same amount of SOP CRT (i.e., 10 1-h sessions). The
tDCS electrode placement followed the unilateral monopolar montage provided in Clark et
al. (2012) which targeted the ventral frontal cortex (anode over F10, cathode over the
contralateral shoulder, 2mA, 20 minutes). Duration and stimulation strength was guided by
empirical and clinical-based best practices and recommendations (Ahn et al., 2017; Bikson
et al., 2016; Priori et al., 1998; Woods et al., 2016; Woods et al., 2014). The tDCS
stimulation was administered with a Soterix conventional 1×1 device utilizing a single anode
and cathode system and two saline soaked 5 cm by 7 cm sponges (4 ml per side of each
sponge). A current of 2.0 mA was administered via the anode over F10 and cathode placed
on the contralateral left shoulder. Cranial measurement and electrode placement was done
before cognitive training began using the 10–20 international system. Stimulation was
increased to 2.0 mA for all participants in the sham training group, remained at 2.0 mA for
30 seconds (s), and decreased back to 0, similar to other tDCS procedures (Nilsson et al.,

Transp Res Part F Traffic Psychol Behav. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 01.

2017). The active training group was administered stimulation at 2.0 mA for 20 consecutive
min consecutively unless discomfort was reported at which the stimulation was decreased to
a tolerable level. Various sensations related to the stimulation were assessed at 5 and 10-min
marks of the simulation; see Fazeli et al. (2017). Participants in both conditions continued to
wear the electrodes after the stimulation shut off at 20 min until after the 1-h training session
was complete to prevent unintentional loss of blinding due to skin warming or redness
occurring under the active electrodes vs. sham electrodes.

SOP-CRT was administered using BrainHQ (BrainHQ is a registered trademark of Posit
[Science, Inc., www.brainhq.com). Participants in both training groups were required to](http://www.brainhq.com/)
complete 10, 1-h training sessions alternating between Double Decision and Target Tracker,
exercises designed to tap into visual attention and tracking speed (Edwards et al., 2015).
Participants were instructed to complete the tasks that are presented in a gaming paradigm,
allowing participants to see personal performance and gains. Ten, 1-h sessions, totaling to 10
h of training was chosen as it has shown efficacy in previous training paradigms (see Ball et
al., 2002; Vance et al., 2012). Prior research demonstrates that pairing tDCS with training
tasks simultaneously is more effective than delivering stimulation prior to training (Martin,
Liu, Alonzo, Green, & Loo, 2014). Thus, both CRT and tDCS were delivered
simultaneously. Further descriptive information on training parameters for the sample is
presented in Table 1.


**2.3. Measures**

**2.3.1. Demographics**


**Demographic Questionnaire.: A standard self-report questionnaire was given to**
participants at baseline to collect pertinent sociodemographic information such as age,
gender, race, education, and health history. Along with general health history, self-reported
length of diagnosis, current CD4 count, and viral load were obtained as well as clinic
records to confirm self-reported health information.

**Driving History Questionnaire.: A driving history questionnaire, administered in an**
interview style at baseline, was used to assess whether the participant possessed a current
and valid driver’s license. Participants also reported their current average amount of days
driven per week (regardless of their driver’s license status).


**2.3.2. STISIM Driving Simulator (STISIM Drive, 2007)—Participants completed a**
practice drive (approximately 1 mile) and drove an experimental drive for approximately 5
miles (ranging from 10 – 15 minutes to complete depending on driving speed and reactions
to hazards; Bishop, Biasini, & Stavrinos, 2017) in a driving simulator using STISIM drive
technology (STISIM Drive, 2007). The standardized protocol was also previously used and
published with a different clinical sample of drivers in Bishop et al. (2017). The simulation
was displayed on three 20-inch LCD computer monitors. Participants sat within the
simulator’s driving compartment, which provided a view of the simulated roadway, rearview
mirror, and dashboard instruments, which included a speedometer. Participants were
instructed to move the steering wheel in a typical driving manner and to depress the
accelerator and brake pedals accordingly. The simulator provided naturalistic engine sounds

along with external road noise via the on-board stereo system. The participants were
instructed to drive as they normally would on a real road and were monitored for driving
simulator sickness in both the practice and experimental drives. If simulator sickness
symptoms were apparent, the simulator drive was discontinued immediately. Participants
drove alone in a room, without the experimenter visually present to reduce experimenter bias
and external distraction.

The practice drive consisted of a two lane bi-directional road with suburban daytime scenery,
similar to the experimental drive. To determine successful completion of the practice drive,
participants had to successfully maneuver around an embedded hazard of a pedestrian
walking out from behind a side-parked car. Successful completion of the practice drive
consisted of completing the scenario without a collision within three successive tries. If a
participant could not successfully complete the practice scenario within three successive
tries, it resulted in exclusion from completing the experimental drive. The experimental
drive consisted of a bi-directional roadway with simulated vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians
in both urban and suburban daytime scenery. The scenario contained 8 embedded hazards
which were programmed to interact with the driver and elicit a behavioral response, such as
releasing the accelerator, depressing the breaking, or swerving (Bishop et al., 2017). Based
on previous hazard perception research, the hazards were categorized into three types: (1)
behavioral prediction hazards (e.g., the hazard can be anticipated such as a car in clear sight
on the side of the road that pulls into traffic), (2) environmental hazards (e.g., the hazard
cannot be anticipated directly such as a child steps into the road from behind a van), and (3)
dividing and focusing attention hazards (e.g., multiple hazard factors or precursors that the
participant must monitor in the environment simultaneously such as busy intersections;
Crundall et al., 2012). Scenario hazards varied between pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles.
To capture basic driving performance, the task demand was kept at a low level (e.g., no
complex route planning or secondary distraction tasks). First reaction to the specific hazard
along with other driving metrics and behaviors were recorded by the simulator.


**Driving metrics: Lane deviations: the number of times the left tire of the vehicle came in**
contact with the center line or the right tire came in contact with the road edge (Stavrinos et
al., 2015; Stavrinos et al., 2013).

Violations: the number of speed exceedances (the number of times the vehicle exceeds the
speed limit by 8 mph or greater; Bishop et al., 2017), stop sign tickets, and traffic light
tickets.


Collisions: the number of hit pedestrians, cyclists, objects, and simulated vehicles (number
of times the simulated vehicle hit another vehicle in the scenario) as well as off-road
collisions (number of times the simulated vehicle left the road past a predetermined distance
threshold; Bishop et al., 2017; Stavrinos et al., 2015; Stavrinos et al., 2013).


Hazard reaction time (RT): time in s between the triggering of the hazardous event and one
of four behavioral responses to all hazards (behavioral prediction, environmental, and
focusing attention; Bishop et al., 2017). The behavioral responses included: 1) depressing
the accelerator pedal by 10% to increase vehicle speed; 2) releasing the accelerator pedal by

10% to decrease vehicle speed (Rakauskas, Gugerty, & Ward, 2004; Stavrinos et al., 2015);
3) applying at least 1 pound of pressure to the brake pedal to decrease vehicle speed
(Crundall, Andrews, van Loon, & Chapman, 2010; Garrison & Williams, 2013); and 4)
moving the steering wheel by a 5-degree change to avoid hitting the hazard (Crundall et al.,
2010; Garrison & Williams, 2013). Standard deviation of lane positioning (SDLP): lane
positioning variability (i.e., swerving) in the section of the drive with no hazards (Marcotte
et al., 2003; McGehee, Lee, Rizzo, Dawson, & Bateman, 2004; Stavrinos et al., 2015).

Average driving speed: average driving speed in miles per hour (mph) across the entire drive.
Standard deviation (SD) of speed: speed variability or fluctuation in mph across the entire
drive (Stavrinos et al., 2015; Stavrinos et al., 2013).


**2.4. Data analyses**

All analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 (IBM Corp., 2014) and with an
alpha value of 0.05.


**2.4.1. Preliminary analyses—Shapiro-Wilk tests were conducted to assess the**
normality of the standardized residuals for all the simulated driving outcomes of interest
between groups. Most of the driving outcomes between groups were non-normal (p’s <
0.05). The data were not transformed in efforts of interpretation and that ANOVAs are
generally robust to non-normality regarding Type I errors (Keselman et al., 1998), as well as
the fact that this was a pilot study with the goal of examination of effect sizes of the
intervention approach. Descriptive statistics as well as group differences on participant
characteristics were conducted.

**2.4.2. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) – Driving**
**simulator outcomes—A series of separate two-way RM-ANOVAs were conducted to**
assess group mean differences in driving outcomes from pre-to post-test. For both models,
training group (coded 0 = sham training group, 1 = active training group) was designated as
the between-subjects factor and time (time point 1 = baseline, time point 2 = post-test) was
designated as the within-subjects factor. In the second series of RM-ANOVA driver’s license
status (coded 0 = expired or no license, 1 = valid and current license) was added to the
model to account for differences in driving per fo r ma nc e ba sed o n dr iver ‘s lice ns e st at
us. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to account
for individual differences in baseline performance and avoid interpreting possible regression
to mean effects as training gains (Basak & O’Connell, 2016; Boot, Blakely, & Simons,
2011). Findings were similar across both tests; thus, RM-ANOVAs are reported below.


### 3. Results

Findings regarding tDCS sensations during training, perceptions regarding training, and
combination tDCS SOP-CRT effects on cognitive outcomes (UFOV[®], executive function,
and language ability) is reported in the parent study (Fazeli et al., 2017). While not the aim

**3.1. Preliminary results**

As seen in Table 1, on average the sample drove 3.27 days per week (range = 0 – 7 days) and
did not significantly differ between groups (p = 0.084). Over half of the sample reported
having a valid and current driver’s license (n = 16). There was a significant difference in the
number of participants with a current driver’s license and those who did not, (p = 0.014),
with the active training group having more licensed drivers (n = 11) than the sham training
group (n = 5). The two groups did not significantly differ on lab CD4 count (p = 0.946) and
the majority (n = 28) reported an undetectable viral load. Given that current driver’s license
status significantly differed between the groups, all models were run controlling for driver’s
license status as well as days driven per week to investigate any possible influence on the
training effect. Results were similar when conducted with either covariate, thus reported
analyses controlled for driver’s license status to account for group differences.


**3.2. RM-ANOVAs – Driving simulator outcomes**

Average driving simulator performance on the seven driving performance outcomes is listed
in Table 2. When assessing unadjusted time and training group interactions for all the
driving outcomes, training effects were found for average driving speed and lane deviations.
At the alpha level of 0.05, average driving speed emerged as the only significant driving
variable with a large effect, F (1, 28) = 9.85, p = 0.004, η[2] = 0.260, d = 1.19. Observation of
the means seen in Figure 2a shows a 1.52 mph decrease in average driving speed for the
active training group and a 2.74 mph increase in average driving speed for the sham training
group. Regarding lane deviations, the time by group interaction was significant with a
medium effect only at an alpha level of 0.10, F (1, 28) = 3.57, p = 0.069, η[2] = 0.113, d =
0.714. The same pattern was seen when observing the mean differences for lane deviations
(see Figure 2b) as the active training group showed a decrease in lane deviations by 2.40
deviations while the sham training group increased in lane deviations by 1 deviation from
baseline to post-test.


The interaction effect was not significant for driving violations (p = 0.520, η[2] = 0.015, d =
0.247), collisions (p = 0.893, η[2] = 0.001, d = 0.063), hazard RT (p = 0.467, η[2] = 0.019, d =
0.278), SDLP (p = 0.719, η[2] = 0.005, d = 0.142), and SD of speed (p = 0.279, η[2] = 0.042, d
= 0.419). When investigating raw mean differences regardless of significance level from
baseline to post-test, driving violations, hazard RT, and SD of speed showed the same
pattern of change with the active training group showing 1.47 fewer violations, a 0.10 s
faster RT, and a 0.23 mph smaller deviation in speed compared to the sham training group
which showed 1.53 more violations, a 0.03 s slower RT, and a 0.67 mph larger deviation in
speed. Driving collisions and SDLP showed a different pattern of change as both training
groups showed fewer driving collisions (sham = 0.40, active = 0.33) and more deviation in
lane positioning (sham = −0.14, active = −0.08) at post-test. The main effect of time was not
significant for any of the driving outcomes (p’s > 0.05), suggesting a lack of exposure or
learning effect related to the driving simulator from baseline to post-test.


When controlling for current driver’s license status (see Table 3), the significant large
training effect for average driving speed was still evident (d = 0.972). The training effect at
alpha level 0.10 was no longer present for lane deviations, yet the finding still revealed a

medium effect in the direction as seen in the previous model (d = 0.640). No significant
findings were found for any of the other simulated driving outcomes, but the effect sizes
were similar in that small effects were seen for violations (d = 0.286) and collisions (d =
0.398). Interestingly, after controlling for driver’s license status, the effect size improved for
SDLP from no effect to a small sized effect (d = 0.514). No effect was seen for hazard RT (d
= 0.063) and SD of speed (d = 0.090). When assessing the time by driver’s license
interaction, a significant large effect was present for SDLP (d = 0.876) and a medium effect
at alpha level 0.10 for SD of speed (d = 0.756).


### 4. Discussion

Utilizing a combination tDCS and CRT methodological design, active tDCS SOP-CRT was
found to affect certain, but not all, simulated driving behaviors as compared to sham tDCS
SOP-CRT in older PLWH. Results suggested more cautionary driving behavior following
active tDCS SOP-CRT as individuals randomized to that training group showed fewer lane
deviations (number of centerline crossing and road edge excursions) and a slower average
driving speed. These findings are in comparison to the sham training group who showed an
increase in driving deviations and average driving speed. While not significant, inspection of
raw mean differences revealed the same pattern of change with no-to-small effects sizes for
driving violations (number of speed exceedances, stop sign tickets, and traffic light tickets),
hazard RT (average of the first reaction time to behavioral prediction, environmental, and
focusing attention hazards), and SD of speed.


After controlling for current driver’s licensure status, the significant training effect was only
evident for average driving speed. While lane deviations were no longer significant at an
alpha level of 0.05 or 0.10, the same raw mean difference was evident with the active tDCS
SOP-CRT group showing fewer lane deviations while the sham tDCS SOP-CRT group
increased. Furthermore, while the p-value was no longer significant at an alpha level of 0.10,
a medium effect was still present for lane deviations. This finding of a medium effect as well
as the small effects found for SDLP, violations, and collisions with no statistical significance
may be due to the relation between sample size and p-values, but not effect size (Sullivan &
Feinn, 2012).


While cautionary or safer driving behavior should be interpreted with discretion, typical
driving simulator safety studies focus on performance variables such as deviations and
average speed, as indicators of driving safety (Wang, Zhang, Wu, & Guo, 2007). Regarding
the current findings, the task at hand was for participants to drive as they normally would in
an urban/suburban scenario which was embedded with unexpected hazards, potentially
making slower speeds safer when avoiding such hazards. While slower driving speed may
not always suggest safer driving (Horberry et al., 2004), studies have shown that faster
driving speed is related to crash involvement (Aarts & van Schagen, 2006), such that faster
speeds are related to increased crash risk (Aarts & van Schagen, 2006; Elander, West, &
French, 1993). Furthermore, after administering anodal tDCS to DLPFC, Beeli et al. (2008)
also found reductions in average speed, revolutions per minute (i.e., how many times the
engine is turning per minute) and number of speed errors, and an increase in headway
distance, suggesting a possible upregulation of safe driving behaviors. Regarding lane

-----

deviations, the findings may also conclude safer driving as increased lane deviations have
shown association to distracted driving behaviors (Stavrinos et al., 2015; Stavrinos et al.,
2013), which further increase crash risk and negative driving outcomes (Klauer et al., 2014;
Stavrinos, Pope, Shen, & Schwebel, 2017). Furthermore, practice effects (i.e., main effect of
time) were not found for driving simulator outcomes, suggesting that baseline to post-test
learning was minimal, adding more support for the medium to large training effect sizes
found for lane deviations and average driving speed.

Although these significant findings support the role of the frontal lobes and the response
driven and goal-directed behavior of driving, namely the ventral frontal cortex, prefrontal
cortex, and the premotor cortex, given the limited focality and widespread effects of the
conventional tDCS technique used in the current study (Kessler et al., 2013; Minhas et al.,
2010; Minhas et al., 2012; Woods et al., 2016), regional specificity of these individual
frontal areas cannot be determined. Previous research has shown an association between the
DLPFC and premotor cortex and driving behavior, suggesting the role of cognitive control
and preparatory motor responses in responding to stimuli in the driving environment
(Graydon et al., 2004; Spiers & Maguire, 2007). Less is known about the role of the ventral
frontal cortex, particularly the rIFC, and its association with risk-taking behavior;
specifically the role of the salience network, which aids in the filtering and orienting of
attention to relevant stimuli (Menon, 2015). Furthermore, the salience network has been
associated with mediating the switching between the central executive and the default mode
network by detecting relevant salient events and initiating a sequence of signals, engaging
the central executive and suppressing the default mode network (Goulden et al., 2014;
Menon, 2015; Sridharan et al., 2008). Regarding driving, associations between the ventral
frontal cortex and risky driving behavior have not previously been found (Spiers & Maguire,
2007), but these areas may play a role in detecting and switching attentional focus to key,
safety-related stimulus, aiding in the overall regulation of safe or cautionary driving
behavior. While these findings and the mechanisms behind them need further investigation,
the associations between the frontal lobe areas, salience network, and default mode network
may help to explain the effects seen with combination tDCS SOP-CRT.


There are three notable limitations of needed discussion that may have contributed to the
findings. First, a full factorial design (i.e., a true control group, SOP-CRT only group, and
tDCS only group) was lacking. While these methodological arms are needed for a full
assessment on the effect of combination tDCS SOP-CRT on simulated driving performance,
the study was a preliminary, pilot study which assessed feasibility of a CRT of this nature in
a clinical population know to have deficits in SOP (Fazeli, Marceaux, Vance, Slater, & Long,
2011; Vance et al., 2012) and be at risk for decrements in driving performance (Marcotte et
al., 1999; Marcotte et al., 2004; Vance et al., 2014). The second limitation, sample size also
relates to the preliminary nature of the study. While the sample size was small, it was
consistent with other tDCS studies and larger than both Beeli et al. (2008) (n = 24) and
Sakai et al. (2014) (n = 13) which also focused on simulated driving outcomes. Furthermore,
while recruitment efforts focused on a representative HIV sample in the Southeast United
States, HIV samples are heterogeneous across the nation and globally. Currently, our sample
of mostly African American males is reflective of PLWH in Alabama (Alabama Division of

Transp Res Part F Traffic Psychol Behav. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2019 October 01.

STD Prevention and Control, 2014; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
2014). Future investigation is needed in larger sample sizes.

Lastly, one notable limitation that could have aided in lack of effects on driving outcomes
was the usage of the monopolar montage with the anode placed over the F10 with the
cathode on the contralateral left shoulder. This montage corresponds to stimulation of the
ventral frontal cortex related to attentional shift from a focal point to an unexpected stimuli
(Fox et al., 2006; Vossel et al., 2014), and would result in an overall broad range of
stimulation of the frontal lobe with less focal effects from the return electrode, but possible
dampening of the stimulation due to the distance from the stimulating electrode (Coffman,
Clark, & Parasuraman, 2014). Furthermore, this electrode placement followed other training
paradigms that targeted complex behavior, attention, and learning (Clark et al., 2012;
Coffman, Trumbo, & Clark, 2012; Falcone, Coffman, Clark, & Parasuraman, 2012). The
F10 with contralateral left shoulder montage differs from previous tDCS studies focusing on
cognitive processing (Coffman et al., 2014) and driving (Beeli et al., 2008; Sakai et al.,
2014) as many use a more focalized approach, stimulating the DLPFC (F3/F4), an area of
the frontal cortex related to higher-order cognitive processing, such as executive function
(Banich, 2009). Further studies should target F3/F4 in the context of combination tDCS
SOP-CRT for comparative effects between widespread frontal lobe stimulation and a more
targeted simulation of a specific frontal lobe area.


### 5. Conclusion

Employing a combination tDCS SOP-CRT intervention, active tDCS SOP-CRT over 10
hours was found to increase cautionary simulated driving behavior in older PLWH. While
findings warrant further investigation using different methodological designs and larger
sample sizes, they extend previous research focusing on tDCS and its applicability using
complex real-world behaviors. Findings expose an avenue of intervention and rehabilitation
regarding driving performance which may improve injury prevention efforts and improve
quality of life for the aging population.
