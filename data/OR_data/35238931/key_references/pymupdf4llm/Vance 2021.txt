**Abstract**
Half of people with HIV (PWH) have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). This study examined whether
cognition can be improved using a framework targeting impaired individual cognitive domains in PWH with HAND. In this
two-group pre-post experimental design study, 88 adults with HAND were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact control
group (n = 40) or (2) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group (n = 48). Baseline cognitive performance was
assessed on eight cognitive domains. A theoretical framework was used to determine the two cognitive domains selected for
training. With priority on speed of processing (SOP) and attention impairments, participants received SOP and/or attention
training if such impairments were detected; if not, participants were assigned to cognitive training in one/two of the least
impaired cognitive domains contributing to their HAND diagnosis. Global cognitive score was slightly improved following training (p = 0.256; d = − 0.21), but it was not significant. Significant improvements were observed on SOP following
training in that domain (SOP; d = − 0.88; p = 0.011). SOP training also improved functioning in other cognitive domains.
This individualized cognitive intervention did not change HAND status, but it did result in improved SOP, in turn yielding
improvement in other cognitive domains.

### Introduction

In 2018, nearly 51% of people with HIV (PWH) in the U.S.
and dependent areas were aged 50 and older [1]; by 2030
this number is expected to increase to 70% [2].

Combined with the effects of cognitive aging, the incidence and severity of such cognitive impairments, often
referred to as HIV-associated Neurocognitive Disorder
(HAND), is expected to increase as people age with HIV [3,
4]. Such cognitive impairments can impair everyday functioning (i.e., driving safely, medication adherence, financial
management) and quality of life (i.e., cognitive complaints,
depressive symptomatology, poor locus of control) [5]. As
such, HAND can decrease autonomy and increase the need
for caregiving support [6].

#### HIV‑Associated Neurocognitive Disorder

A diagnosis of HAND is established using a neuropsychological algorithm called the Frascati criteria [7]. Developed
by a team of neuroAIDS experts, these criteria require the
use of norm-based (age/education) cognitive performance
measures in five or more cognitive domains. HAND is diagnosed when a person performs more than 1 SD below his/
her demographically adjusted mean in two or more cognitive

domains (e.g., executive function, memory) [8]. (For more
details regarding nuances of the HAND diagnosis see Blackstone et al. [9]). As such, it is common for PWH to meet
the criteria for HAND by only a fraction of a SD. If there
are interventions that can improve cognitive functioning by
such a fraction, it is possible to reduce the incidence of the
HAND diagnosis. This finding would represent a shift in
the way we consider HAND, removing its stigma as a static
“progressive” diagnosis to something that can be modified
and treated. Indeed, studies suggest HAND has a variable
course, as compared to more degenerative conditions such
as Alzheimer’s disease [10].

#### Cognitive Training

Fortunately, cognitive training programs resulting in smallto-moderate cognitive improvements, perhaps by only a
fraction of a SD, may sufficiently improve performance in
an individual’s critical cognitive domain(s). In a systematic
review of 13 studies on cognitive training programs in PWH,
Vance and colleagues found that, in general, cognitive training successfully improved cognition in the domain that was
targeted for training [11]. For example, Vance, Fazeli, Ross,
Wadley, and Ball [12] randomized a sample of 46 adults
living with HIV to either: (1) a no-contact control group,
or (2) a speed of processing (SOP) training group. Those in
the SOP training group received 10 h of computerized exercises specifically designed to improve the ability to quickly
process visual stimuli. This study demonstrated that SOP
training was effective as measured by the Useful Field of
View test, a cognitive test of visual SOP and visual attention
(p = 0.04, power = 0.53). In addition, the training improved
everyday functioning as measured by the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) test (p = 0.03,
power = 0.59).
Yet, with the relatively few studies, generally underpowered due to small sample sizes, of cognitive training
in PWH, the clinical utility of recommending and administering cognitive training in this clinical population remains
unclear. Fortunately, studies in older adults without HIV provide additional insights. In a meta-analysis of 52 cognitive
training studies using a variety of computer-based cognitive
training protocols (in one or multiple cognitive domains)
conducted with community-dwelling older adults aged
60–82 years old, Lampit and colleagues [13] determined that
the average cognitive improvement after cognitive training
was 0.22 standard deviations (SD). Upon closer examination,
these researchers found significant cognitive improvement
across various domains including SOP (g = 0.31), visuospatial skills (g = 0.30), nonverbal memory (g = 0.24), working
memory (g = 0.22), and verbal memory (g = 0.08). Although
these training gains are expressed in small-to-moderate
effect sizes, based on how HAND is operationalized, such

## 1 3


cognitive improvement after training may be enough to
change this classification.

#### Methods for Changing the HAND Diagnosis

Although we may be able to improve function in specific
cognitive domains via cognitive training, such training
often requires 10–20 h of intense engagement per cognitive
domain [13]. Many with HAND experience impairments in
numerous cognitive domains [4]; thus, the time required to
engage in cognitive training to improve all impaired domains
could be significant (e.g., 100 h), which represents significant burden and likely would result in non-adherence. A
strategy to allocate such cognitive training to a smaller number of domains may reduce such burden, facilitate adherence, and improve cognition.
To address this dilemma, such a strategy was created
called the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training
Framework [14]. This framework posits that in order to not
over burden the participant, cognitive training should target
the individual’s impairments in SOP and attention first, if
any impairments in these two domains are detected for the
participant. Otherwise, cognitive training should focus on
the domains that are least impaired but still contribute to the
HAND diagnosis. Thus, only two cognitive domains should
be targeted for training (10 h of training for each cognitive
domain). This framework is based on the Diminished SOP
Theory [15] and the Wickens Model of Information Processing [16], as well as evidence from the cognitive aging
literature, which demonstrate that improvements in SOP and
attention are core cognitive abilities that support all other
cognitive domains. For example, in a sample of 186 PWH,
Fellows, Byrd, and Morgello [17] observed that SOP “fully
mediated the effects of age on learning, memory, and executive functioning and partially mediated the effect of major
depressive disorder on learning and memory” (p. 806). Thus,
improvement in these cognitive domains theoretically can
transfer to improvement in other cognitive domains. (Details
of the framework are described in the Methods section.)

#### Hypothesis

Based on this literature and the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training Framework just described, this study posed
two aims. Aim 1 was to test the hypothesis that a personcentered cognitive training intervention targeting impaired
individual cognitive domains can reduce the incidence of
individuals meeting the criteria for HAND in PWH age 40
and older. Aim 2 was to explore whether targeted cognitive
training would produce cognitive benefits on global and individual cognitive functioning scores.

### Methods

#### Design Overview

The Training on Purpose Study (TOPS) examined an
Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training Framework,
an algorithm to allocate domain-specific cognitive training
to address each participants’ unique pattern of cognitive
impairment as determined during the baseline assessment.
This framework was designed to decrease the severity and
incidence of cognitive impairment in certain domains, and
thus possibly reduce the severity and incidence of HAND.
In this two-group pre/post experimental design, participants were recruited from a university HIV/AIDS clinic
and were administered a comprehensive battery of cognitive and psychosocial measures at baseline. Those who
met the diagnostic criteria of HAND were randomized to
either: (1) a no-contact control group, or (2) an Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group. Participation
in the no-contact control group was limited to the baseline assessment, and then the posttest assessment approximately 12 weeks later. Those in the experimental group
engaged in 20 h of cognitive training programs targeting
two cognitive domains, with ten hours targeting one cognitive domain and ten hours targeting another cognitive
domain in which impairments were detected at baseline.
Again, the framework was used to determine which specific cognitive training programs each participant received
based on his/her baseline cognitive performance. After
cognitive training was completed approximately 12 weeks
later, these experimental participants were administered
the posttest assessment. Ethical approval for this study was
granted by the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s
Institutional Review Board.

#### Participants

As can be seen from the Consort Figure (Fig. 1), potential
participants were recruited from flyers posted at an HIV/
AIDS clinic, AIDS service organizations, local churches,
and public businesses (e.g., laundromats). Those interested called a phone number listed on the flyer and were
screened over the telephone to determine eligibility. Inclusion criteria included: (a) diagnosed with HIV for at least
1 year; (b) 40 years of age or older; (c) free from any
severe neuromedical condition (e.g., schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury); (d) not currently
undergoing radiation or chemotherapy; (e) able to communicate proficiently in written and spoken English; (f)
adequate vision and hearing; and (g) residence within 100
miles of the research center. From this, 135 participants


**Fig. 1 TOPS consort diagram**

were consented at baseline and administered a cognitive
battery; based on their cognitive performance, the Frascati
criteria were applied to determine whether participants
met the criteria for HAND (described below). The 109
participants who met the HAND criteria were informed
of this and randomized into the study. The 26 participants
who did not meet the HAND criteria were also informed
of this result, at which point their participation ended. Participants were compensated for the pretest/posttest assessments ($50 each) and cognitive training sessions ($15/hour
of cognitive training).

#### Measures

Participants completed 1.5–2 h assessments at the research
center at baseline/pretest and posttest. These assessments
were administered by a trained cognitive tester who was
supervised by the Principal Investigator to prevent drift in
the cognitive assessment protocol.

**Demographics**

Age, gender, education, and other basic demographic information was determined by self-report at baseline.

## 1 3

**Health Information**

A health questionnaire was administered at baseline in which
participants indicated prescribed medications, and alcohol
(i.e., number of drinks on a typical day when drinking) and
tobacco use (i.e., number of cigarettes smoked per day).

**HIV Health Status**

Upon entering the study, participants’ medical providers
were contacted for the following information: HIV-positive
diagnosis confirmation, years diagnosed with HIV, current
and nadir CD4+ lymphocyte count, current viral load, and
HIV medication regimen.

**Depression**

Depression was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CES-D; [18]).
A score of 16 or higher reflects significant depressive
symptomology.

**Cognitive Domains and Frascati Criteria**

Eight cognitive domains were assessed using standardized
normed cognitive measures at pretest and posttest; these
measures are commonly used in neuroAIDS research [9, 19].
Normed T-scores of the cognitive measures were used to
approximate clinical ratings of cognitive functioning in each
of the domains ranging from 1 (above average, if T-score is
55 or higher) to 9 (severe impairment, if T-score is 19 or
below). This cognitive battery consisted of: (1) SOP (Stroop
Color Naming Test, Trails A); (2) attention (Paced Auditory
Serial Attention Test); (3) executive function (Stroop Interference), Trails B); (4) spatial learning and memory (Benton
Visual Retention Test—Revised); (5) delayed spatial learning and memory (Benton Visual Retention Test Delayed—
Revised); (6) spatial visualization (WAIS IV Block Design);
(7) verbal learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning
Test—Revised); and (8) delayed verbal learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Delayed—Revised) [9,
19, 20]. Using this baseline cognitive battery, cognitive
impairments were identified for training (see the Procedures/
Treatment section below).
Using each participant’s cognitive domains test scores
combined, an algorithm was used to calculate a Global Clinical Rating score ranging from 1 (above average) to 9 (severe
_impairment). Specifically, scores from 5 to 9 reflected in_
two cognitive domains indicated HAND. Thus, using this
continuum, the Global Clinical Rating score of 5 or higher
was indicative of HAND [9, 19]. In making a medical diagnosis of HAND, other factors such as impairments in everyday functioning and the contribution of comorbidities to

## 1 3


cognitive impairments are often considered. For this study,
only cognitive performance was taken into consideration
(e.g., meeting the criteria for the least severe category of
HAND labeled as asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment

[ANI]). (For more information regarding HAND and other
TOPS methodological details, see Vance et al. [14]).

#### Procedures/Treatment Design and Rationale

Participants with HAND were randomized to the control
group (n = 40) or the cognitive training group (n = 48). A
block randomization strategy ensured a balanced assignment
between women/men and Africans Americans/Caucasians.
Time between baseline and posttest was approximately
85.25 (SD = 48.69) days (control group = 84.48 (SD = 27.76)
days; cognitive training group = 85.92 (SD = 61.22) days,
_t-value = 0.14(86), p-value = 0.89). Participants in the cog-_
nitive training group received ten hours of training in each
of two areas of impairment detected during baseline testing. Under the supervision of a cognitive trainer, all cognitive training occurred at the research center to monitor
participants’ progress, assist with logging onto the computer
program, provide encouragement, and maintain treatment
fidelity. The cognitive trainer was taught how to administer
the cognitive training and was supervised by the Principal
Investigator to avoid drift in the cognitive training protocol.
Cognitive training requires intense focus and can result in
fatigue. For this reason, breaks were provided to participants
as needed. The training dose of ten hours in each of two
cognitive domains (for a total of 20 h per participant) was
selected based on the concern that training fatigue would
lead to attrition as well as the U-shaped dosage-therapeutic
response reported by Lampit et al. [13]. Other studies support 10 h as a sufficient training dose to improve function in
a particular cognitive domain [12, 21].
As mentioned, participants may have impairments in up
to all eight cognitive domains; however, it is not feasible
to target 80 h of cognitive training (i.e., 10 h of training/
domain × 8 cognitive domains). For this reason, a cognitive
training algorithm was developed to target the cognitive
domains that would be most likely to reverse the HAND
diagnosis for each individual participant, and in which the
participant might have the greatest amount of cognitive
reserve. The Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training
Framework was designed specifically for this study with
three steps [14]. In step one, participants with impairments
in either SOP (n = 22) or attention (n = 13) were automatically assigned cognitive training in one or both of those
domains; as alluded to previously, these are considered
core cognitive abilities that support the functioning of other
cognitive domains. In step two, participants without impairments in either SOP or attention (or with impairments in
only one) were assigned to cognitive training in their least


-----

compromised (but still impaired) cognitive domain(s) (i.e.,
closest to cutoff of 1 SD below the demographically-adjusted
mean). The rationale for this was that participants may have
more cognitive reserve in relatively preserved domains and
may obtain greater benefit from training in these domains
than in more compromised domains. This approach purposely manipulates the criteria by which HAND is diagnosed by targeting the cognitive domain needing the least
improvement to no longer meet the HAND criteria.
In step three, participants were assigned to play computerized modules that were selected specifically to improve
their abilities in the targeted cognitive domains. The modules used for each cognitive domain were as follows: (a)
SOP (Double Decision; Hawkeye; Visual Sweeps); (b)
attention (Divided Attention; Target Tracker); (c) executive
function (Mind Bender; Mixed Signals); (d) spatial learning
and memory (Mental Maps; True North); (e) delayed spatial
learning and memory (Mental Maps; True North); (f) spatial
visualization (Mental Maps; True North); (g) verbal learning and memory (Memory Grid; Syllable Stacks); and (h)
delayed verbal learning and memory (Memory Grid; Syllable Stacks). More information about these cognitive training
[modules can be found at www.​brain​hq.​com.](http://www.brainhq.com)
A treatment adherence checklist was used to review with
participants the amount of time that they had engaged in
cognitive training. The software also monitors the amount
of time participants spend engaged in each exercise. The
correlation between the checklist and the software on time
engaged in cognitive training was very high _r = 0.935;_
_p = 0.001). For the convenience of the participants, they_
could do two hours of training at a time to reduce the number of visits to the research center, but in general, most
participants spread out their cognitive training sessions.
Participants completed cognitive training in an average of
approximately 12 weeks (averaging 1.66 h/week of cognitive
training). Lampit and colleagues found optimal therapeutic
effects occurred when training sessions are administered
1–3 times per week—dosage parameters incorporated in the
TOPS protocol [13]. Furthermore, similar to the seminal
ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and
Vital Elderly) Study (N = 2802), participants were considered to be trained in each cognitive domain when they successfully completed 7–10 h of training in each domain [21].

#### Data Analysis

To produce fair comparisons between study groups across
cognitive domains, based on their baseline cognitive assessment, the same cognitive training assignment algorithm was
applied to participants in the control group to determine the
training they would have received had they been randomized
to the individualized-training group [22]. Thus, outcomes
from the trained group in a specific domain were compared


to those from participants in the control group who were
their matches in the sense that they would have received
that specific training. From this, two sets of analyses were
conducted, a completers-only analysis (n = 41 trained vs.
_n = 40 in the control group) and an intention to treat (ITT)_
analysis including n = 7 participants who did not complete
training (n = 48 in the training group vs. n = 40 in the control
group). The ITT results are presented in this report. A completers-only analysis may be informative when examining
the actual potential of the cognitive training, and results are
available as supplemental materials (Supplemental tables 1,
2 and 3). The main conclusions did not differ across the
two sets of analyses, although there was some variability in
the estimates, as expected from changes in small samples.
The sample size considerations for the study were based
on feasibility and, as with any pilot project [23], the study
was not powered for formal statistical inference. Therefore,
interpretation is based on in-sample measures of effect size
and results are considered exploratory. Analysis began by
examining balance between study groups with respect to
baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, HIV markers, etc.) using measures of effect size, such as Cohen’s d
(small ~ 0.2, medium ~ 0.5, large ~ 0.8) and Cramer’s _V_
(small ~ 0.1, medium ~ 0.3, large ~ 0.5, for cross-tabulations
comparing two groups) [24]. Next, for each of the eight cognitive domain scores, descriptive statistics were tabulated at
the pre- and post-intervention time-points by study group
(matched by assigned training and hypothetical assigned
training). Linear mixed-effects models with a random effect
for subject were used to estimate the between-group difference in change from pre- to post-intervention, using a
time-by-group interaction coefficient. The variance components from each model were used to estimate a pooled SD for
each domain score, which was then used to standardize the
interaction coefficient and provide a measure of effect size
(Cohen’s d). The Satterthwaite approximation to degrees of
freedom was used for significance tests of the interaction
effect. Analyses were conducted using R software version
3.6 [25].

### Results

#### Participant Characteristics

Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the N = 88 participants included in the ITT analysis. On average, participants were 54.2 (SD = 7) years old, about two thirds
were male (n = 60, 68.2%), and the majority were African
American (n = 75, 85.2%). Participants had an average of
12.4 (SD = 2.2) years of education and reported an average
income of approximately $17,600 (SD = $14,600). In terms
of selected HIV characteristics, on average participants had

Measures of effect size did not suggest any major imbalance
between the study groups, however, a moderate difference
in mean current CD4+ T lymphocyte count/mm[3] scores was
observed, with a higher value in the control group. On further inspection, it was found that the difference came from
the right tail of the distribution with a few participants having relatively high CD4+ T lymphocyte counts. After a log
transformation of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts, the betweengroup standardized difference was reduced to d = 0.2 (a
small effect size).

#### Effects of Training on Cognitive Domains

Table 2 presents descriptive statistics and measures of training effect overall and by each specific cognitive domain. The
between-group comparisons for specific domains include
only participants trained in that domain vs. matched control participants (i.e., control participants who would have

## 1 3


received training in that domain had they been randomized
to the training group). A small beneficial intervention effect
(d = − 0.21) was observed for the Global Clinical Rating. Large beneficial effects were observed for the SOP
(d = − 0.88), Executive Function (d = − 0.89), and Spatial
Learning and Memory (d = − 0.71)) domains. Medium to
moderate beneficial effects were observed for Attention
(d = − 0.45) and Delayed Spatial Memory (d = − 0.32)). A
moderate detrimental effect was observed for the Delayed
Verbal Memory (d = 0.35) domain.
Table 3 presents measures of training effect on all
cognitive domains, comparing participants trained in a
specific domain vs. their respective matched control participants. Herein, due to the number of comparisons, we
focused on the medium to large effects (d ≥ 0.5), ignoring trivial and small effects. Compared to their control
counterparts, participants who received SOP training
showed medium to large improvements on Attention, Verbal Learning and Memory, Delayed Verbal Memory, and
Executive Functioning (d ranging from − 0.7 to − 0.63).
Participants who received Attention training showed a
medium to large improvement on Executive Functioning
and Delayed Verbal Memory. Participants who received
Delayed Verbal Memory training showed medium to large

For comparison purposes, controls in this analysis were compared to treatment group as if they were assigned a similar hypothetical assignment


improvements on SOP and Executive Functioning. Participants who received Executive Functioning training
showed medium to large improvements on SOP, Attention,
and Delayed Verbal Memory. Participants who received
Spatial Learning and Memory training showed medium
to large improvements on SOP, Delayed Verbal Memory,
and Executive Functioning. Participants who received
Delayed Spatial Memory training showed medium to
large improvements on SOP and Attention. Participants
who received Spatial Visualization training showed a large
detrimental effect on Executive Functioning.

#### Attrition

For the purpose of providing information on potential characteristics of participants at risk of attrition from future
cognitive training studies, measures of effect size were used
to compare the n = 21 participants who were lost to followup vs. the n = 88 who provided a post-test assessment, on
sociodemographic characteristics and baseline cognitive
scores. In terms of the relevant differences found, participants who dropped from the study were more likely to be
assigned to cognitive training (n = 16, 76.2% vs. n = 48,
54.5%, V = 0.17); tended to be older (M[SD] = 54.2[6.97]
vs. 50.9[4.7], d = 0.5)); tended to have more years of education (M[SD] = 12.4[2.2] vs. 11.4[2.6], d = 0.46); tended
to have slightly lower depression symptoms (CESD:
_M[SD] = 17.54[10.7] vs. 20.7[9.6], d = 0.31); and tended to_
consume more alcohol (no. daily drinks: M[SD] = 1.8 [0.9]
vs. 1.3[0.6], d = 0.61).


### Discussion

Aim 1 of this study was to examine whether a personcentered cognitive training intervention targeting impaired
individual cognitive domains would reduce the incidence of
HAND diagnoses. An early interim descriptive study (n = 6)
comparing experimental and control participants of TOPS
showed observable cognitive improvement in those who
received cognitive training, but no change in HAND diagnosis [26]. Completion of the TOPS study revealed similar
findings; global clinical rating improved, but not to the point
in which a HAND diagnosis could be changed (i.e., at posttest 6 (15%) control and 3 (6.25%) experimental participants
no longer met the criteria for HAND). Therefore, the intervention was not effective in changing the diagnosis; however, additional analyses on individual domains suggested
the intervention exerted therapeutic cognitive benefits.
Aim 2 of this study was to examine, overall, whether
cognitive training could produce cognitive changes, even
if not effective in reducing the incidence of HAND. As
observed in our analyses, SOP was improved. Furthermore,
some support for the Salthouse Diminished SOP Theory was
found in that improved SOP transferred to improvement in
other cognitive domains (i.e., attention, verbal learning and
memory, delayed verbal learning and memory, executive
functioning); this suggests that SOP as a cognitive domain
supports the functioning of other domains. Our finding also
corresponds to the meta-analysis by Lampit and colleagues
which found SOP training to be the most robust cognitive
training approach [13]. Of interest, cognitive training in
domains other than SOP also transferred to improvements

in non-trained domains, particularly SOP and executive
functioning. This suggests wide-spread neural activation
reflective of positive neuroplasticity [27].

#### Implications for Practice

Several important considerations for clinical practice follow from this study. First, of the 135 participants at baseline, 109 (81%) met the cognitive definition of HAND. Such
a high incidence of HAND suggests that monitoring and
screening for cognitive health is an essential component of
a routine visit. Second, coupled with the existing literature,
this study provides partial support for the use of cognitive
training to remediate or protect cognition, especially in the
domains of SOP and executive function [12]. In fact, in the
ACTIVE study, older participants who received SOP training also experienced other therapeutic benefits including
reduced incidence of depression and dementia over time

[28],and also improved in the areas of locus of control, selfrated health, health-related quality of life, driving safety
and mobility, and everyday functioning as measured by
the TIADL test [29, 30]. As mentioned earlier, in a separate study of 46 PWH randomized to SOP training or a nocontact control group, Vance and colleagues also observed
improved performance in everyday functioning as measured
by the TIADL after cognitive training [12]. Currently there
are no consensus guidelines for the treatment of HAND and
HIV-related cognitive impairment; however, it is likely that
cognitive training will be one of the recommendations moving forward, along with encouraging healthy lifestyle behaviors (i.e., ↑ physical exercise, ↓ stress). Third, a diagnosis of
HAND can generate much angst and confusion. In fact, in
this TOPS study, we informed participants of their HAND
diagnosis and at posttest qualitatively assessed their reaction to receiving this news from us [31]. The themes that
emerged were Sadness, Anxiety, Unexpected, Concerned,
_Not Concerned/No Reaction, but surprisingly other themes_
included Confirmation (that they knew they were experiencing cognitive issues), Knowledge Seeking, and Desire
_to Improve. Particularly noteworthy, participants wanted to_
know more about how to treat HAND and improve and protect their cognitive abilities, thus assuaging their fears and
improving their quality of life. Engaging in cognitive training can be part of that approach.

#### Implications for Research

Although cognitive training was somewhat effective in
improving some cognitive domains, the algorithm used to
select training domains may not be the most therapeutic for
two reasons. First, as we selected the least impaired cognitive
domains for training (unless SOP or attention impairments
were detected), participants may not have had to improve


much in order to rise above the criterion for HAND. Second, it is possible that targeting the most impaired domains,
instead of the least impaired, may produce the greatest overall cognitive improvement by reducing intra-individual variability (i.e., dispersion) in cognitive functioning [32, 33].
Studies suggest that greater variability in performance across
cognitive domains (e.g., very poor executive function and
SOP, but superior verbal memory) predicts progressive cognitive decline. In fact, intra-individual variability is related
to cognitive decline in older adults [34], structural atrophy
in hippocampal and entorhinal areas in normal older adults
and adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) [33], and
everyday functioning deficits in older PWH [32]. Thus, targeting those out of range, most impaired, cognitive domains
for cognitive training may be a better therapeutic approach
than the algorithm tested in the TOPS study. So instead of
training to the diagnostic criteria of HAND, cognitive training targeting the most impaired cognitive domain may be
more clinically relevant. Yet this approach assumes that one
has enough cognitive reserve within that domain to benefit
from the cognitive training [11, 35].

#### Strengths and Limitations

All studies have limitation and strengths; this study is
no exception. Notable study limitations are below. First,
although standardized cognitive measures were used, no
true test of each cognitive domain exists. All domain-specific cognitive tests minimize, but never eliminate completely (i.e., spillover effect) the contribution of other cognitive domains to task performance. Second and similarly,
although cognitive training is directed toward strengthening function in one specific cognitive domain, such benefits also spillover to other domains. Third, it is not clear
whether the training effects observed are robust over time
as this was not a longitudinal study. Fourth, due to financial
limitations of this pilot study, a no-contact control group
was employed; in future studies, a social and computer contact control group would have provided a more matched,
meaningful comparison [36]. In fact, in a cognitive training
study that used both a no-contact control group and social/
computer-contact groups, the effect sizes between the two
control groups were very similar, which demonstrates that
they are both effective control groups [37]. Fifth, some attrition bias may have occurred, with those being assigned to
the experimental group being slightly more likely to drop out
of the study, possibly due to the demands of the cognitive
training. Sixth, although we used a randomization procedure to control for race and gender, other criteria were not
considered due to the small sample size. Seventh, as in any
intervention study, there is the possibility of attention bias
in that participants may perceive their cognition is improving by engaging in the cognitive intervention, regardless of

## 1 3


-----

whether there is any therapeutic efficacy to the intervention.
And finally, some self-report items were used (i.e., depressive symptomatology).
Likewise, three study strengths were noted. First, we used
accepted procedures and norm-based standardized cognitive performance measures to diagnosis HAND. Second, we
employed a block randomization procedure to control for
race and gender. And third, we used commercially available,
standardized cognitive training modules; this ensured that
the participants received the exact training within each of
the distinct cognitive domains being targeted.

### Conclusion

In summary, this study is innovative in delivering a combination of cognitive training protocols in an individualized
manner tailored to the participants’ cognitive performance
level. Although the overall approach was not effective in
reducing the incidence of HAND, cognitive improvement
was observed following some cognitive training protocols,
especially SOP. Future research may consider other algorithms in which computerized cognitive domain training can
be combined with other cognitive strategies (e.g., reducing
intra-individual variability to produce better cognitive stability), and possibly paired with other therapies (e.g., transcranial direct current stimulation, nootropics) to improve and
protect cognition as PWH age.
