### Abstract

Some older adults with HIV experience poor sleep which can worsen cognition. Transcranial
direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cognitive training have improved sleep and cognition in
studies of older adults; yet their combined influence is unknown in adults with HIV. Older adults
with HIV (n = 33) and without HIV (n = 33) were randomized to receive 10 one-hour sessions of
speed of processing (SOP) training with tDCS or sham tDCS over approximately 5 weeks. tDCS
with SOP training did not improve sleep. Omitting correction of multiple comparisons for this
exploratory pilot study, main effects for HIV (F[1, 59] = 5.26, p = .03, ηp[2] = .082) and tDCS (F[1,
59] = 5.16, p = .03, ηp[2] = .080) on the Digit Copy Test were detected. A HIV x tDCS interaction
was detected on the Letter Comparison Test (F[1, 59] = 5.50, p = .02, ηp[2] = .085). Useful Field of
View scores improved across all four groups (F[1, 59] = 64.76, p < .001, ηp[2] = .523). No
significant effects for HIV (F[1, 59] = 1.82, p = .18) and tDCS (F[1, 59] = .01, p = .94) were
detected on the Useful Field of View test. While the current study did not show effects of
combined tDCS and SOP training on sleep quality, future studies are needed to examine the effects
of such interventions on sleep-related cognitive functions among those cognitively impaired adults
with HIV.

HIV experience HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders despite the use of combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART) (Bonnet et al., 2013; Heaton et al., 2010). Given adults age 50
and older will comprise 70% of the HIV population by 2020 (U.S. Special Senate
Committee on Aging, 2013), concerns mount that the effects of HIV-related
neuroinflammation and the process of aging may negatively impact cognitive functioning.
While there are multiple contributors to poor cognitive functioning, some age-related
changes in sleep quality may influence cognition. Interventions targeting sleep quality
should be examined in efforts to facilitate better cognitive functioning.

Compared to the general population, some studies suggest there is a higher prevalence of
sleeping problems among adults with HIV (Taibi, 2013; Wibbeler, Reichelt, Husstedt, &
Evers, 2012). In a study of adults with HIV (n = 180) and without HIV (n = 120), Wibbeler
and colleagues (2012) found that compared to adults without HIV, daytime sleepiness was
higher (46.6% versus 19.4%), and the percentage of those with poor sleep quality was higher
(63.9% versus 21.0%) in adults with HIV. Although there are numerous factors that
contribute to differences in sleep quality, some adults with HIV may be more sensitive to
physiological (e.g., immunological state and effects of antiretroviral medications) (Allavena
et al., 2014) and socio-psychological changes such as stress of an HIV diagnosis and lack of
employment (Vance et al., 2015) that may adversely affect their sleep quality. Unfortunately,
poor sleep quality can worsen cognitive function in multiple domains. Also, poor cognitive
function and increased neuroinflammation over time can aggravate sleep quality.


### Sleep and Cognitive Functioning

According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, sleep plays a functional role in synaptic
plasticity or strengthening of neuronal connections and promotes growth of new neurons in
the hippocampus, particularly the dentate gyrus which involves the formation of memories
(Stickgold & Walker, 2013; Tononi & Cirelli, 2014). Poor sleep quality inhibits restoration
of cortical regions of the brain, primarily the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for the
brain to perform higher level cognitive processes such as executive functioning (Plessis et
al., 2014). Given adults with HIV are susceptible to cortical (e.g., cerebral cortex) and
subcortical atrophy (e.g., basal ganglia) (Kuper et al., 2011), the effects of poor sleep quality
on such areas may be more severe and negatively impact cognitive function. In some adults
with HIV, atrophy of subcortical regions of the brain such as the basal ganglia may alter
neurotransmitter levels involved in sleep regulation (e.g., serotonin) which can compromise
sleep quality (Yaffe, Falvey, & Hoang, 2014). Therefore, those with HIV who have
preexisting problems (e.g., mood disorders) regulating neurotransmitter levels may be more
susceptible to poor sleep quality which may further impair cognitive functioning (Cody &
Vance, 2016).


### Cognitive Training and Sleep Quality

Cognitive training, which involves focused learning, may increase the demands for sleep,
and thus induce it (Haimov & Shatil, 2013). Sleep may help restore the brain in preparation
for later use of higher level cognitive processes (Tononi & Cirelli, 2014). The effects of
cognitive training on sleep quality have not been examined in adults with HIV; however,

Haimov and Shatil (2013) examined such effects after randomizing older adults with
insomnia to a cognitive training group (n = 34) or a control group (n = 17). The cognitive
training group completed a home-based computerized cognitive training program
(CogniFit[®]), which consisted of 21 different training tasks that varied in level of difficulty.
The control group completed basic computer tasks (e.g., reading, copying texts, changing
font, drawing, and coloring pictures) in Microsoft Word and Paint. Both groups performed
three 20–30 minute sessions per week with a no-training day in between sessions for a
period of 8 weeks. At baseline and posttest, participants were asked to wear an actigraph for
one week to monitor sleep patterns and examine changes in total sleep time, sleep onset
latency, sleep efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, and total number of awakenings. Also,
the participants were asked to keep sleep diaries during actigraphy monitoring for precise
measurement of sleep quality. Compared to the control group who performed basic tasks in
Microsoft Word and Paint, the cognitive training group showed improvements in sleep
quality (i.e., sleep onset latency and sleep efficiency). In addition, better concentration was
associated with an increase in the duration of sleep which suggests that sleep may influence
attention span (Haimov & Shatil, 2013). Also, Haimov and Shatil’s findings suggest that
sleep may depend on keeping the brain active. Therefore, cognitive training may lead to
cognitive exertion which can increase one’s demand for sleep.

Similarly, speed of processing (SOP) training is a computerized cognitive intervention
designed to increase the speed and accuracy in which participants visually perceive certain
stimuli (Ball, Edwards, & Ross, 2007). A series of tasks involve identifying a target object in
the center of the monitor and simultaneously locating another object in the periphery. The
tasks become increasingly difficult and are adjusted based on the individual’s performance
level (an easier task is presented when a task is performed incorrectly, and a more difficult
task is presented when a task is performed correctly). In concurrent tasks of visual
discrimination and attention, objects are presented at faster speeds and embedded among
distractors. The Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly (ACTIVE)
Study was one of the largest studies of cognitive training and everyday functioning outcomes
in older adults. Findings from this study showed, compared to memory and reasoning
training, SOP training improved cognition and instrumental activities of daily living and
these gains were sustained for 10 years post-training (Ball et al., 2007; Rebok et al., 2014).
For these reasons, in the current study SOP training was chosen as the most robust cognitive
training that may yield the strongest neural benefit to facilitate better sleep.


### Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and Sleep Quality

To date, the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on sleep quality in
adults with HIV have not been examined. However, studies have shown positive effects of
tDCS on sleep quality in adults with other comorbidities such as bipolar disorder (Minichino
et al., 2014). tDCS is a non-invasive technique that uses static direct electrical currents to
stimulate the brain, thereby subtly altering membrane potential of neurons (Brunoni et al.,
2012). tDCS involves the application of a low (≤ 2 mA) direct current to the scalp using two
electrodes, the anode and cathode. The anodal electrode or positive charge is positioned
where the current will enter the brain and excite underlying neurons; whereas, the cathode or
negative charge is positioned where the current will exit and reduce excitability of neurons

### Purpose

 Methods


(Brunoni et al.). Several studies support the use of anodal tDCS for cortical excitability and
targeting the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which according to the 10/20
International Positioning System is located around F8 or F10 (right temple above the
sphenoid bone). Also, some studies have shown that stimulation of specific areas of the brain
using anodal tDCS can improve sleep quality. For example, Minichino and colleagues
(2014) found that placement of the anode (stimulatory electrode) on the left prefrontal area
with the cathode (inhibitory electrode) on the right cerebellar cortex improved subjective
sleep quality in euthymic bipolar patients. Perhaps, concurrent stimulation of certain brain
areas using anodal tDCS and a demanding cognitive training protocol such as SOP training
may lead to cognitive exertion, and thereby increase the demands for sleep. In addition, this
novel approach may enhance noncognitive gains (e.g., protection from depression, better
self-rated health) observed from SOP training alone (Vance, Humphrey, Nicholson, &
Jablonski-Jaudon, 2014). Hence, such benefits may also improve sleep health in older adults
with and without HIV.

The current study was designed to examine global sleep quality and SOP in older (50+)
adults with and without HIV who received tDCS or sham tDCS with SOP training. The
study was conducted to address the following two research aims: Aim 1 – Examine changes
in global sleep quality and SOP among older adults with and without HIV who received
tDCS or sham tDCS with SOP training (controlling for age, education, and baseline scores);
Aim 2 – Examine correlations between change scores for global PSQI and SOP measures by
training group.


For Aim 1, it was hypothesized that older adults that received tDCS with SOP training,
regardless of HIV status, will have more improvements in sleep quality and SOP. Given that
poor sleep and cognitive impairments are common among older adults with and without
HIV, both groups may benefit from the potential effects of the combined intervention.
However, since adults with HIV have certain cognitive vulnerabilities, this study compares
the effects of tDCS and SOP training in adults with and without HIV. For Aim 2, it was
hypothesized that changes in sleep quality would positively correlate with changes in SOP
by training group. Therefore, improvements in sleep quality would correlate with
improvements in speed of processing, and declines in sleep quality would correlate with
declines in speed of processing. This hypothesis was based on the bi-directional relationship
between sleep and cognitive function.


**Design Overview**

In this study of adults with and without HIV, stratified randomization (a balanced protocol
using race, gender, and baseline SOP performance) was used to assign participants to one of
four groups: 1) HIV-positive tDCS, 2) HIV-positive sham tDCS, 3) HIV-negative tDCS, and
4) HIV-negative sham tDCS. All groups concurrently received SOP training (10 one-hour
sessions) with either sham or active tDCS over a period of approximately 5 weeks.

**Participants**

**Intervention**


Participants received a baseline and immediate posttest comprehensive neurocognitive
battery.

Permission was obtained from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)
Institutional Review Board to enroll participation from older adults in the community and
the UAB 1917 HIV/AIDS Clinic. This pre-post experimental study targeted two groups:
adults age 50 and older with and without HIV. Participants were recruited by word of mouth,
flyers, and an online ad. Potential participants were instructed to call the study coordinator
who then screened them to determine if they met study criteria. Participants were excluded
for the following: younger than 50 years of age; homeless; unable to speak and understand
English; mentally impaired (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or mental retardation); deaf
or blind; having experienced brain trauma with loss of consciousness greater than thirty
minutes; having other significant neuromedical diagnosis (e.g., schizophrenia, epilepsy, or
bipolar disorder); currently receiving chemotherapy, radiation, or dialysis; undergoing
treatment for depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders; being left-handed; having
intracranial metal plate implants; having a pacemaker or other biomedical device; having
previously participated in SOP training; having untreated hypertension; not being a licensed
driver; and/or lacking experience using a computer mouse. The only differences between
criteria for HIV+ and HIV-samples was the HIV+ criteria did not exclude those without a
driver’s license or without experience using a computer mouse; however, they were excluded
if they have not been diagnosed with HIV for at least 1 year to minimize other confounders
that may affect cognition such as reactive depression (Vance, Struzick, & Burrage, 2009).
Eligible participants were scheduled an appointment for a baseline visit, after which they
were randomized to either sham tDCS or active tDCS groups.


A newer version of the SOP program, BrainHQ, was used in this study. Participants were
asked to play two games at our lab, Double Decision and Target Tracker, for 1 hour twice a
week over a period of 5 weeks (10 training sessions total). In Double Decision, participants
were presented an object (car/truck) in the center of the computer monitor and a Route 66
sign in one of several peripheral fields at various speeds, and then asked to identify which
central object (car/truck) was presented and the location of the Route 66 sign (see Figure 1).
When participants performed the exercise correctly, the speed at which the objects were
presented increased and then the objects were embedded among distractors, thus making the
task more difficult. When participants performed the exercise incorrectly, the correct answer
was displayed on the computer screen and the exercise automatically decreased in speed.
This double-staircase technique allowed participants to perform the SOP exercises at their
maximum threshold level. Based on their initial performance, if participants improved in
subsequent exercises, they could proceed to levels that were more challenging. If
participants did not improve, they were given the option to replay the game to increase their
score at the current level.

Also, the participants played a game called Target Tracker (see Figure 2). In this game,
participants were initially presented one or more objects (balls or jellyfish) and asked to

**tDCS**


watch the objects as they moved across the screen among several other balls or jellyfish.
When the objects stopped moving, participants were asked to identify the original objects
locations. If participants correctly identified the original objects location, they were
presented an additional object the next trial. If participants incorrectly identified the original
objects, they were presented fewer objects the next trial. At the end of each set of exercises,
those who improved their score had the opportunity to move up to the next level which
required participants to identify a greater number of objects. However, participants who did
not improve could replay the previous level to try and increase their score. Anytime during
the hour, participants could alternate between playing Double Decision and Target Tracker;
hence, these exercises were designed to improve visual SOP and divided attention.

Previously, Clark and colleagues (2012) found that stimulation of F10, the right frontal
cortex, increased learning and correlated with improvements in correctly identifying
concealed objects. Similarly, this single-blind pre-post study adopted the tDCS protocol used
by Clark and colleagues (2012) to examine the effects of tDCS with SOP training on SOP
and sleep quality. In this study, a 4 cm[2] sponge electrode was placed over the right inferior
frontal cortex near F10 and the cathode electrode was placed on the contralateral upper arm.
The participants in the active tDCS group received a 2.0 mA current for 20 minutes while
engaging in SOP training. After such time, the current was turned off although the
participants continued to engage in the SOP training until the end of the hour. Similarly,
those in the sham tDCS condition had an identical protocol except they received the 2.0 mA
current for only 30 seconds, and then the strength of the current ramped down to 0 mA.
During the training, participants were asked to describe the physical sensation of the tDCS
after 5 minutes and 15 minutes using the following descriptors: “0) no sensation, 1) cold, 2)
some tingling, 3) warm, 4) lots of tingling/some itching, 5) very warm, 6) lots of itching, 7)
burning (like a sunburn), 8) burning (like scalding water), 9) ‘hurts a lot’” (Clark et al. 2012,
p.120). If participants indicated a 7 or higher, they were given the option to continue or
reduce the stimulation. One participant in this study indicated a sensation of 7 or higher and
her tDCS amperage was reduced to a level she could tolerate. Otherwise, participants
completed 10 hours of training at the center using the aforementioned combined SOP and
tDCS training protocols.


**Study Measures (Baseline and Posttest)**

Prior to beginning the study, informed consent was obtained from participants. The baseline
and posttest assessments were 2.5-hour visits. At baseline, several measures were used to
gather background information and assess sleep quality and cognitive ability. Sleep quality
and cognitive ability were reassessed at posttest.


**Demographic Questionnaire.—This experimenter-generated measure was used to**
gather information on age, gender, race (0 = minority, 1 = nonminority), household income
before taxes (1 = $0 – $10K; 2 = $10,001 – $20K; etc), and years of education.

**Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.—The PSQI, a questionnaire consisting of 19 items,**
was used to measure participants’ sleep quality in the past month. The seven subscales of

-----

PSQI include sleep efficiency, sleep duration, sleep disturbance, sleep latency onset, sleep
medication use, and daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness. Using a Likert-type scale (0 =
not at all, 1 = less than once a week, 2 = two or more times a week, and 3 = three or more
times a week), participants were asked to what extent do various factors such as waking up
in the middle of the night interfere with their sleep. Scores from the subscales were summed
to yield a global score ranging from 0 to 21, with scores greater than 5 indicating poor sleep
quality. In a study of 80 patients with primary insomnia, test-retest reliability was 0.87
(Backhaus, Junghanns, Broocks, Riemann, & Hohagen, 2002).

**Letter and Pattern Comparison Test.—These two paper-and-pencil tests measured**
SOP. In the Letter Comparison Test, participants were presented two sets of letters
containing three (e.g., HLV, HLX), six (e.g., NLCVZL, NLCVZL), or nine (e.g.,
SLNFZHMBQ, SLHFZNMBQ) segments. Given 20 seconds per section (6 sections),
participants were asked to write as quickly as possible a “S” if the segments were the same
or “D” if the segments were different. The score was the total number of correct responses
ranging from 0 to 192, with higher scores indicating faster SOP (Salthouse, 1991). Similarly,
the Pattern Comparison Test consisted of 96 pairs of patterns containing three, six, or nine
line segments. Given 20 seconds per section (3 sections), participants were asked to write as
quickly as possible a “S” if the patterns were the same or “D” if the patterns were different.
The score was the total number of correct responses ranging from 0 to 96, with higher scores
indicating faster SOP (Salthouse, 1991).


**The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Symbol Substitution and**
**Copy Tests.—The WAIS Digit Symbol Substitution Test was used to measure visuomotor**
coordination and attention, while Digit Symbol Copy test was used to measure psychomotor
speed (Lezak, 1995). First, participants were administered the substitution test. Participants
were presented 9 digits paired with distinct symbols. Participants were given 90 seconds to
write symbols that correspond to the digits in each box. The score consisted of the number
of correctly written symbols, with higher scores indicating better visuomotor coordination.
Similarly, the symbol copy test consisted of 93 symbols and participants were asked to copy
the symbol in the adjacent boxes provided. The time it took for participants to complete the
task was recorded with less time to complete the task indicating better psychomotor speed.

**Useful Field of View (UFOV[®]).—This computerized test was used to measure visual**
attention and SOP. Like previous studies, this test consisted of three subtests beginning with
easy tasks that became more complex. In subtest 1, a measure of simple SOP, an object (car/
truck) was displayed in the center of the computer screen at various speeds between 17 and
500 milliseconds and participants were asked to identify which object (car/truck) was
displayed. In subtest 2, a measure of divided attention, participants were presented an object
in the center of the computer screen in addition to a car in one of eight peripheral visual
fields. Participants were asked to identify the central object while simultaneously selecting
the peripheral location of the car. In subtest 3, a measure of selective attention, participants
were asked again to identify the central object and location of the car in one of eight
peripheral fields; however, the task was more difficult because there were distractors
surrounding the central object and the peripheral car. The computer automatically presented

the central object at a slower speed when participants answered test items incorrectly; in the
same manner, participants were presented the central object at the faster speed when they
answered test tasks correctly. Visual SOP was calculated using the total in milliseconds of
all three subtests; fewer milliseconds indicated faster visual SOP. Test-retest reliability is
quite high and ranges from 0.74 to 0.81 (Ball et al., 2007).


**Statistical Analysis**

Data were examined using SPSS 21. Linear regression was used to impute PSQI baseline
global scores for two participants, one with and the other without HIV. Specifically, two
participants had a single missing component of the baseline PSQI (sleep quality and sleep
disturbance); therefore, the remaining components were used to estimate the missing
component for these two participants. From this, baseline global PSQI scores were both
calculated. Out of 80 cases, fourteen were excluded from this analysis: nine with missing
posttest data (HIV-positive = 4; HIV-negative = 5), one practice participant, and four other
participants in the HIV-positive sample (one with a stroke, two with schizophrenia, and one
with a stroke and schizophrenia). The demographic and baseline SOP and sleep differences
between adults with and without HIV were examined using independent samples t-test and
chi-square analyses (see Table 1). ANOVAs and chi-square analyses were used to examine
demographics, mean global PSQI scores at baseline, and mean scores on SOP measures at
baseline between the four training groups: HIV-positive tDCS (n = 17), HIV-positive sham
tDCS (n = 16), HIV-negative tDCS (n = 17), and HIV-negative sham tDCS (n = 16) (see
Table 2). For Aim 1, separate ANCOVAs were used to examine change in pre-post mean
scores for global PSQI and SOP measures (controlling for age, education, and mean baseline
scores for PSQI and SOP measures) for all four groups (see Table 3). Specifically, main and
interaction effects of independent variables (HIV status and training group) were examined.
In this study, separate ANCOVAs for each SOP outcome measure was performed because
each SOP measure examined a different aspect of SOP. The Letter and Pattern Comparison
Test measured speed and attention, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test measured visuomotor
coordination and attention, the Digit Copy Test measured psychomotor speed, and the
UFOV measured visual attention and SOP. For Aim 2, Pearson-product-moment correlation
analyses were performed to examine change scores for PSQI and SOP measures (see Table
4A and 4B). The change scores for PSQI and the SOP measures were calculated by
subtracting the posttest score from the baseline score. Correlation analyses were conducted
for adults with and without HIV and separated by training groups. Since this was a pilot
study with a limited sample size, correcting for multiple comparisons was not conducted.


### Results

**Descriptives and Group Differences**


The adults with HIV (Mage = 55.82, range = 51–71 years of age) were significantly younger
than those without HIV (Mage = 62.12, range = 50–87 years of age). Compared to adults
without HIV, there were significantly more racial minorities (χ[2][n = 28] = 5.99), p = .01)
and men (χ[2][n = 22] = 10.28), p < .01) among those with HIV. Adults without HIV had a
significantly higher income and were more educated than those with HIV (p < .01).

As seen in Table 1, for mean global PSQI scores, adults with HIV scored higher (M = 9.65;
SD = 5.14) which indicated significantly poorer sleep quality compared to those without
HIV at baseline (M = 5.23; SD = 3.24), t(54) = 4.18, p < .01, d = 1.03. For SOP measures,
adults without HIV scored significantly better (Mnumber correct = 31.91; SD = 6.90) on the
Pattern Comparison Test compared to adults with HIV (Mnumber correct = 28.36; SD = 6.25),
t(64) = 1.46, p < .15, d = 0.54. Sleep and SOP differences were further examined across the
four training groups. As seen in Table 2, there were significant differences (p < .01) in age,
gender, race, education, household income, global PSQI scores, and Pattern Comparison
scores among the four training groups at baseline. At baseline, the two groups of adults
without HIV that received either tDCS with SOP training or sham tDCS with SOP training
were older, had more income, were more educated, had lower global PSQI scores (better
sleep quality), and scored better on the Pattern Comparison Test. Therefore, age, education,
and baseline PSQI and SOP scores were controlled to reduce confounding effects.


**Aim 1 - Examine changes in global sleep quality and SOP among older adults with and**
**without HIV who received tDCS or sham tDCS with SOP training.**

The mean number of adults with HIV and without HIV separately by training group at
baseline and posttest are presented in Table 3, alongside an ANCOVA analysis of the effects
of HIV status, tDCS, and their interaction on the post-measures (controlling for age,
education, and baseline scores).


**Changes in Global Sleep Quality Post-Training—After controlling for age,**
education, and baseline global PSQI scores, there were no significant differences in global
sleep quality between the groups post-training (all p values > .05). Although not significant,
the greatest change in sleep quality was detected among the HIV-positive sham tDCS with
SOP group.

**Changes in SOP Post-Training—After controlling for age, education, and baseline SOP**
scores, there were no significant differences in scores on the Pattern Comparison, Digit
Substitution, and UFOV Tests between the groups post-training (all p values > .05). For the
Digit Copy Test, a main effect for HIV (F[1, 59] = 5.26, p = .03, ηp[2] = .082) and a main
effect for tDCS (F[1, 59] = 5.16, p = .03, ηp[2] = .080) were detected; those who had HIV
and/or received sham tDCS with SOP training performed better on the Digit Copy Test. A
HIV-by-tDCS interaction on the Letter Comparison Test was significant (F[1, 59] = 5.50, p
= .02, ηp[2] = .085); follow up pairwise comparisons using least significant differences
showed that among adults with HIV, those who received tDCS with SOP training scored
significantly better than those who received sham tDCS with SOP training (p = .019), while
there was no significant difference by condition among those without HIV (p = .244). Scores
on the UFOV improved across all the groups (F[1, 59] = 64.76, p <.001, ηp[2] = .523);
however, there were no significant main effects for HIV (F[1, 59] = 1.82, p = .18) and tDCS
(F[1, 59] = .01, p = .94) detected. This finding is consistent with previous studies of SOP
training (without tDCS) in adults with and without HIV (Ball et al., 2007; Vance et al.,
2012).

**Aim 2 – Examine correlations between change scores for global PSQI and SOP measures**
**by training group.**

As seen in Table 4A and 4B, correlations between change scores for global PSQI and SOP
measures were examined by HIV status and training groups. For adults without HIV who
received sham tDCS with SOP training, change score for global PSQI was significantly
correlated with change score for UFOV (r = −.670; p < .01); from baseline to posttest,
improvements on PSQI correlated to declines (i.e., faster speed) on UFOV. For adults with
HIV who received sham tDCS with SOP training, change score for global PSQI was
significantly correlated with change score for Digit Symbol Substitution (r = −.619; p < .01);
from baseline to posttest, improvements on PSQI correlated to improvements on Digit
Symbol Substitution. For adults with and without HIV receiving tDCS with SOP training,
there were no significant correlations between change scores for global PSQI and SOP
measures.


### Discussion

Findings from this study were consistent with those from previous studies in that older
adults with HIV have poorer sleep quality compared to those without HIV (Vance &
Burrage, 2005). For Aim 1, no significant improvements in global sleep quality were
detected across the groups. This finding was not surprising for this pilot study with such a
small sample size. Significant improvements on the Letter Comparison Test were observed
post-training for the HIV-positive tDCS with SOP training group. Contrary to our
hypotheses, significant improvements on the Digit Copy Test were observed post-training
for the HIV-positive and HIV-negative sham tDCS with SOP training groups. It was possible
the combined interventions counteracted each other despite their documented independent
effects on sleep and cognitive function. The independent effects of tDCS on the outcome
variables could not be examined as all the groups received SOP training, and thus there was
no tDCS only condition. As expected, scores on the UFOV improved across all groups
which provides further evidence that SOP training can improve SOP abilities in older adults
with HIV, and possibly those with HAND. However, again we did not have a pure control
group to compare the SOP training against.


Furthermore, for Aim 2, significant correlations between change scores for global PSQI and
SOP measures (i.e., UFOV and Digit Symbol Substitution) were detected. For the HIVnegative sham tDCS with SOP training group, improvements on global PSQI correlated with
better performance on UFOV. Similarly, for the HIV-positive sham tDCS with SOP training
group, improvements on global PSQI correlated to improvements on Digit Symbol. Perhaps,
the PSQI may not have been sensitive enough in this study to detect subtle changes in sleep
quality. Various components of sleep can be better examined using actigraphy. Although
costly, polysomnography should be considered for future study of tDCS and SOP training in
adults with HIV with severe insomnia.


**Strengths and Limitations**

In this study, three strengths were obvious. First, this study provided an excellent
opportunity to compare an intervention in two different, but related, populations. Second,

because stratified randomization was used to assign adults with and without HIV to the
training groups, there was minimal sampling bias. Finally, this was the first study to examine
the application of tDCS aimed at improving sleep in the context of a cognitive intervention.

Additionally, there were six limitations in this study. First, imputed data could potentially
influence the results and limit generalizability; however, as this was conducted for 2 cases
only, the possible bias was minimal (Schafer, 1999). Second, PSQI is a subjective measure
of sleep quality, and participants may have under or over reported their sleeping problems.
While the PSQI was used to inquire about sleep patterns over the past month, the 5 weeks in
which participants were training also overlapped when participants commented about their
sleep quality at posttest. Thus, the full treatment had not been delivered by the time
participants rated their sleep quality. The training effects on sleep quality may have been
attenuated. In this study, this measure of sleep quality was used to examine differences
between adults with and without HIV; however, some components of the PSQI (e.g., number
of hours of sleep per night) were not examined. Third, although participants were asked
about cognitive impairment during telephone screening, there was lack of objective data for
neurocognitive performance. Fourth, statistical power was reduced due to the small sample
sizes. Unfortunately, conducting an intervention study of this intensity is costly, thus
preventing recruitment of larger samples. Larger sample sizes and longitudinal studies are
needed to detect true differences across training groups in global sleep quality and SOP.
Fifth, there was no correction for multiple comparisons due to this study being a pilot study.
In this pilot study, scores on the SOP measures were analyzed separately with more
specificity than as a global score. Finally, this study lacked a non-SOP comparative group
which limited generalizability of these results.


**Implications for Practice**

Granted that SOP training did not improve sleep, it has consistently shown to improve SOP
in adults with and without HIV (Ball et al., 2007; Vance, Fazeli, Ross, Wadley, & Ball,
2012). Independently, SOP training can improve cognitive function and other cognitive
influences such as depression which may indirectly improve sleep over time. Also, for
clinicians caring for adults with HIV, it is important to perform thorough assessments
focusing on factors that influence sleep especially for those with cognitive impairments.
Routine sleep assessments in the clinical setting can help provide insight on other health
issues that can affect cognitive functioning such as depression (Gamaldo et al., 2013) and
sleep apnea (Yaffe et al., 2014). In fact, early diagnosis and treatment of sleep problems can
improve cognitive functioning which may also help adults aging with HIV remain
independent in their everyday functioning activities (e.g., taking medications).


**Implications for Research**

With the increasing number of adults aging with HIV, more research is needed to identify
ways to address problems such as poor sleep given its negative affect on cognitive
functioning (Vance, Heaton, Eaves, & Fazeli, 2011). Although there are lack of studies
showing the impact of tDCS on sleep, future objectives should focus on the mechanisms in
which cortical stimulation can improve sleep quality. Further exploration of variations in
tDCS application and techniques, montage, number of training sessions, and frequency of

exposure are needed to examine its modulating effects on sleep disorders such as insomnia.
Although the groups in this study did have PSQI scores above clinical cutoffs, future studies
should examine the effects of cognitive training and tDCS only among adults with HIV with
severe insomnia.

While this article focused on tDCS, recent evidence has shown that newer modalities of
transcranial direct current stimulation such as transcranial alternating stimulation current
stimulation (tACS) can be beneficial for stimulating cortical excitability (Inukai et al., 2016).
In tACS, during half of the cycle, one electrode serves as the anode and the other as the
cathode at a lower current. During the other half of the cycle, the pattern reverse and the
former anode now serves as the cathode and vice versa. Hence, tACS may influence brain
oscillations which can also improve sleep (Vance, Fazeli, Cody, Bell & Pope, 2016). Such
methods necessitate further examination of its applicability and modulatory effects on sleeprelated cognitive functions in older adults with HIV, particularly those at risk for HAND.


**Conclusion**


While the application of transcranial electrical devices in conjunction with other cognitive
training programs and treatments may improve health outcomes in many populations, further
exploration of various techniques is needed to ensure proper usage and safety. Accurate
application to specific brain areas is necessary as well as close monitoring for long-term
effects. As this area of study continues to develop, a greater focus on cognitive training in
addition to lifestyle behaviors such as sleep hygiene may be beneficial for adults with HIV
as they age.
