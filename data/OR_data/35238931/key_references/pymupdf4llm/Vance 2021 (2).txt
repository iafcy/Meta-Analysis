ABSTRACT
Half of people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Fortunately, cognitive training programs can improve function across cognitive
domains, which may translate to everyday functioning. The Training on Purpose (TOPS) Study was
designed to reverse HAND by targeting cognitive training to specific cognitive impairments that
contributed to the diagnosis. A secondary aim of TOPS was to determine whether such cognitive
training improved subjective and objective everyday functioning. In this two-group pre–post
experimental design study, 109 adults with HAND were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact
control group (no training) or (2) the Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group. Each participant received approximately 10 hours of cognitive training in two selected cognitive domains
based on her/his individual baseline cognitive performance. Thus, 20 hours of individualized training on these two cognitive domains occurred over a course of 12 weeks in 1–2 hour sessions.
Specific to the secondary aim of TOPS, measures of everyday functioning were administered
before and after cognitive training to examine transfer effects. The analyses revealed that in general, speed of processing training produced benefits in everyday functioning as measured by the
medication adherence visual analogue scale and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living
test. Inconsistent findings were found for the other seven cognitive training protocols in either
improving everyday functioning or reducing perceived everyday functioning; however, there may
be other contributing factors that obscured such effects needing further research. This study demonstrated that some training protocols vary in efficacy in altering both objective and subjective
everyday functioning ability.

In the United States in 2018, approximately 51% of people
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PWH) were
aged 50 and older, due both to increasing lifespan of PWH
and increased rates of new infections in older people (CDC,
2020); this percentage is estimated to increase to 70% by
2030 (Wing, 2017). The population of PWH is particularly
susceptible to cardiac, metabolic, and neurovascular changes
associated with cognitive aging that may be accelerated by
HIV (Smail & Brew, 2018). Approximately half of PWH
experience cognitive symptoms that, if severe enough, result
in a diagnosis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder
(HAND) (Wei et al., 2020). Combined with nonpathological
effects of aging on cognition, the prevalence and severity of
HAND will likely grow along with the aging HIV population (Goodkin et al., 2017; Smail & Brew, 2018; Vance et al.,
2013). Cognitive impairments in HIV are related to poorer
everyday functioning on tasks such as instrumental activities
of daily living (IADL) (e.g., following directions, counting
change) (Vance, Fazeli, & Gakumo, 2013), driving (Vance


et al., 2014), medication adherence (Caballero et al., 2019),
and online shopping and banking (Woods et al., 2017).
These effects on everyday function are likely to be of greater
concern to PWH than how well they perform on lab-based
neuropsychological tests (Kordovski et al., 2019). Given the
known association between cognition and everyday functioning, if improving cognition is possible, the same may
hold for improving everyday functioning. Cognitive training
represents one strategy to do this.
There has been extensive publicity and research surrounding the concept of “Brain Training” or cognitive training in recent years. For a recent review of cognitive training,
including a meta-analysis of such interventions and their
possible impact on both healthy older adults and those experiencing mild cognitive impairment see Basak et al. (2020).
This analysis examined 215 published studies and reported
that cognitive training is effective in improving cognition in
both healthy adults, as well as those with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), even though all 215 studies did not

demonstrate positive effects individually. These findings are
consistent with another systematic review and meta-analysis
of cognitive speed of processing (SOP) training (Edwards
et al., 2018), which evaluated 44 studies from 17 randomized
trials using the Institute of Medicine criteria. This analysis
indicated that training enhanced neural outcomes (e.g., pupil
diameter, P3b amplitude), and in particular the cognitive
outcomes of SOP.
In a systematic review of cognitive training programs
looking specifically at PWH, Vance et al. (2019) identified
13 studies and concluded that, in general, cognitive training
improved performance in the cognitive domain that was targeted (e.g., executive functioning training improved executive functioning ability). In some studies, cognitive training
that targets one cognitive domain not only transferred to
improvement in other cognitive domains, but also to
improvements in measures of everyday functioning. For
example, in a randomized sample of 46 PWH (no-contact
control group or SOP training group), those in the SOP
training group demonstrated improved performance on both
a measure of SOP (Useful Field of View Test) and the
Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) test
(Vance et al., 2012).
With respect to everyday function, cognitive impairment
in PWH has been shown to be associated with declines in
both basic (e.g., bathing) activities of daily living (BADLs)
and IADLs (e.g., medication adherence) (Johs et al., 2017).
Likewise, in a sample of 162 PWH and without HIV, Vance
et al. (2013) found a significant correlation between the performance-based TIADL test and several measures of SOP as
well as verbal learning and memory, highlighting the
importance of cognitive function on daily functioning.
Similarly, significant correlations were observed between
scores on the Observed Tasks of Daily Living (OTDL) test, a
measure of complex everyday functioning, and neuropsychological performance measures of SOP, executive function,
and verbal learning and memory. In a separate study,
Morgan et al. (2014) found a significant interaction between
HIV status and age for both BADLs and IADLs and for
Karnofsky Performance Scale ratings. The association
between cognitive impairments and BADL and IADL
impairments in older PWH, coupled with evidence that cognitive training yields sustained improvement in cognitive
impairments, supported exploring the possible effect of targeted cognitive training on everyday activities. Using the
logic underlying targeted cognitive domain training (Vance
et al., 2018), small improvements in certain cognitive
domains may translate to meaningful improvement in everyday activities in which people are experiencing difficulties.
Similarly, since SOP and attention are core cognitive abilities
which play a role in all other cognitive domains (Fellows
et al., 2014), targeted SOP or attention training might result
in particularly meaningful improvement in everyday
functioning.
The primary aim of the Training on Purpose Study
(TOPS) was to examine whether targeted cognitive training
can reduce the prevalence and severity of HAND in PWH


are more likely to develop HAND than younger PWH
(Waldrop et al., 2021). Although we were not able to reduce
the prevalence of HAND (Vance et al., in press), using performance-based cognitive tests representing eight cognitive
domains to examine training effects, we were able to
improve functioning in several cognitive domains; in particular, SOP training and executive functioning training
were particularly robust. Thus, the secondary aim of TOPS,
reported in this article, was to examine whether targeted
cognitive training would improve subjective and objective
measures of everyday activities.

##### Methods

Design overview

In TOPS, we examined the effectiveness of an algorithm of
targeted cognitive training to decrease the severity and
prevalence of HAND, as well as explore such training effects
on everyday functioning (Vance et al., in press). Utilizing a
two-group pre–post experimental design, participants
40 years and older were randomized to either: (1) a no-contact control group (no cognitive training at all), or (2) an
Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training group that completed 20 hours of cognitive training focused in two cognitive domains (10 hours each) that contributed the their
HAND diagnosis. The University of Alabama at
Birmingham’s Institutional Review Board approved the ethical conduct of this study.

Participants

As seen from the Consort Diagram (Figure 1), participants
were recruited from flyers posted at AIDS service organizations, an HIV/AIDS clinic, businesses in the community
(e.g., laundromats), AIDS fundraising events, and local
churches. Those interested called a telephone number listed
on the recruitment materials and were screened over the
telephone to determine basic eligibility. Inclusion criteria
included: (a) �40 years of age; (b) diagnosed with HIV for
þ1 year; (c) not diagnosed with a neuromedical condition
that impairs cognition (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury); (d) not currently undergoing
chemotherapy and/or radiation; (e) not legally blind or deaf;
(f) proficient in spoken/written English; and (g) residing
within 100 miles of the research center. From this, 135 participants consented at baseline and were administered a
comprehensive neuropsychological battery to determine
whether they met the Frascati criteria for HAND
(Blackstone et al., 2012). The 109 participants who met the
HAND criteria (5 or higher on the Global Clinical Rating
score) were informed of this and then randomized into the
study. Those 26 participants without HAND were also
informed and their participation was no longer requested.
Compensation for time and effort was provided for the pretest/posttest assessments ($50 each) and the cognitive train

Measures

Participants were administered a �1.5 hour neuropsychological and everyday functioning assessment at the research
center at baseline and posttest. The measures administered
during these assessments relevant to this article are listed in
the following sections.

Demographics
Age, gender, years of education, and employment were indicated by self-report at baseline.

HIV health status
Each participants’ medical providers provided the following
information: HIV-positive diagnosis confirmation, years
diagnosed with HIV, current and nadir CD4þ lymphocyte
count, current quantitative HIV RNA by PRC (viral load),
and types of antiretroviral HIV medication.

Health information
A health questionnaire was administered at baseline in
which participants indicated medical comorbidities, prescribed medications, tobacco use (i.e., how many cigarettes
per day smoked), and alcohol use (i.e., number of drinks on
a typical day when drinking).

Depression
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale

depressive symptomatology. A score of 16 or higher reflects
significant depressive symptomology. Participants with significant depressive symptomatology were provide educational and referral information.

Cognitive domains and Frascati criteria
Using standardized normed cognitive performance tests at
baseline (pretest) and posttest, eight cognitive domains were
assessed. These cognitive performance tests are routinely utilized in the neuroAIDS research (Blackstone et al., 2012;
Woods et al., 2008). T-scores of the cognitive tests approximate clinical ratings of objective cognitive functioning for
each of the eight domains ranging from 1 (above average, if
T-score is 55 or higher) to 9 (severe impairment, if t-score
is 19 or below). This cognitive battery consisted of: (1) SOP
(Trails A, Stroop Color Naming Test); (2) attention (Paced
Auditory Serial Attention Test); (3) executive function
(Stroop Interference, Lezak 1995), Trails B); (4) spatial
learning and memory (Benton Visual Retention Test –
Revised); (5) delayed spatial learning and memory (Benton
Visual Retention Test Delayed – Revised); (6) spatial visualization (WAIS IV Block Design); (7) verbal learning and
memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised); and (8)
delayed verbal learning and memory (Hopkins Verbal
Learning Test/Delayed – Revised). From the baseline assessment, impairments in cognitive functioning were identified
for training purposes (see the Procedures/
Treatment section).
Using each participant’s neuropsychological test scores,
an algorithm was used to calculate a Global Clinical Rating
score ranging from 1 (above average) to 9 (severe impairment). If two domains were in the impaired range (5–9),
then the Global Clinical Rating score reflected the more
severe level of impairment identified. In this continuum, a
global impairment score of 5 or higher was indicative of
HAND (Blackstone et al., 2012). Technically, other factors
such as impairments in everyday functioning and the contribution of comorbidities to cognitive impairments are taken
into consideration when diagnosing HAND. For our study,
only cognitive performance was used in making this diagnosis. (For more information regarding HAND and other
TOPS protocol procedures, see Vance et al., 2018).
Therefore, our study required participants to meet at least
the minimum criteria for HAND, which is the mild cognitive impairment criterion for ANI (deficits that are 1 SD
below the mean in 2 cognitive domains).

Medication adherence visual analogue scale (VAS)
This measure of medication adherence provides a visual
analogue scale/line from 0% to 50% to 100% and asks participants to mark an X on that line that corresponds to
“What percent of your HIV medications did you take?” during the past month. The percentage is the value used in

Simplified medication adherence questionnaire
This questionnaire asks three key questions about taking
one’s medication as prescribed and in a timely manner;
higher scores indicate better adherence. Two items are on a
6-point scale and one item on a 5-point scale; this last item
was transformed mathematically to be on a 6-point scale
and then summed with the other two items. Higher scores
indicate better medication adherence. This measure is validated with virological outcomes and has good internal consistency (a ¼ 0.75) and inter-observer agreement (88.2%)
(Knobel et al., 2002).

Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) test
This performance-based test measures the accuracy and time
it takes to perform five IADLs used in everyday functioning
including finding a number in a phone book, counting
change, reading ingredients from food cans, locating food
items on a shelf, and reading directions from a medication
bottle. A scoring algorithm accounts for the time and accuracy, generating a score with lower scores indicating better
functioning. Test–retest reliability is 0.64. (Goverover et al.,
2007; Owsley et al., 2002).

Modified Lawton and Brody Activities of Daily Living
(ADL) questionnaire
This self-reported questionnaire consists of 16 ADL domains
that measure a participant’s self-perceived functional status,
specifically their decline from prior functioning and need
for assistance. Scores include a total BADL complaints (e.g.,
dressing) continuous score as well as a total IADL complaints (e.g., laundry) continuous score, with higher scores
reflecting more impaired activity domains. An IADL
Dependence categorical variable was also generated, such
that if current functioning level was lower than the highest
level of functioning for at least two domains, this resulted in
a classification of IADL Dependent (Fazeli et al., 2014;
Lawton & Brody, 1969).

Procedures/treatment design and rationale

Participants with HAND were randomized in a 1:1.4 ratio to
the control group or the cognitive training group to slightly
favor more participants being assigned the experimental
treatment as this was the focus of the study with limited
resources. We employed a block randomization strategy to
safeguard balanced assignment between Africans Americans/
Caucasians and men/women. We did not randomize according to HAND severity; however, baseline global cognitive
score between the two groups were similar and not significantly different (no-contact control group ¼ 7.18
(SD ¼ 1.52) & the treatment group ¼ 7.48, p ¼ 0.26). Time
between baseline and posttest was on average 85.25
(SD ¼ 48.69) days (no-contact control group ¼ 84.48
(SD ¼ 27.76) days; treatment group ¼ 85.92 (SD ¼ 61.22)
days, p ¼ 0.89). In the no-contact control group, participants
received no cognitive training (or any type of intervention


researchers between the baseline and posttest assessments;
these participants only received the baseline and posttest
assessments. After posttest, the control group did not receive
the cognitive training. In the treatment group, participants
engaged in ten hours of training for two cognitive domains
(20 hours total) for which impairments were detected at
baseline. All cognitive training occurred at the research center under the supervision of a neuropsychological trainer to
monitor participants’ progress, assist with any computer
issues, offer reassurance and reinforcement, prevent drift in
the protocol, and ensure treatment fidelity.
Based on the concerns of cognitive training fatigue leading to attrition as well as the diminishing therapeutic return
of over training (i.e., U-shaped dosage-therapeutic response
reported by Lampit et al., 2014), we selected a training dose
of ten hours in each of two cognitive domains. In the cognitive training literature, a therapeutic dose of 10 hours is
appropriate to increase function in a targeted cognitive
domain (Ball et al., 2002; Vance et al., 2012); but to reemphasize, participants in the treatment group received
10 hours of training for each of the two cognitive domains
in which they received training for a total of 20 hours of
cognitive training altogether.
A problem associated with applying cognitive training to
address HAND is that participants may have impairments in
all eight cognitive domains. Training in more than two
domains represents significant participant burden as such
training can be fatiguing, resulting in non-adherence. Thus,
we created a cognitive training algorithm to target the cognitive domains that hypothetically could best reduce the
prevalence of HAND for each individual participant. The
Individualized-Targeted Cognitive Training Framework
(Vance et al., 2018) was developed explicitly for this study.
In step one, participants with cognitive impairments in
either SOP or attention were assigned cognitive training targeting their least compromised (but still impaired) cognitive
domain (i.e., closest to a cut-off of 1 SD below the demographically adjusted mean); this was done specifically so participants would no longer meet the clinical criteria of
HAND. Based on the Diminished SOP Theory (Salthouse,
1996) and the Wickens Model of Information Processing
(Wickens et al., 2013), SOP and attention are considered
core cognitive abilities upon which other cognitive domains
depend. Theoretically, improvements in these cognitive
domains may transfer to improvements in other cognitive
domains, and possibly improvements in everyday functioning. For instance, in a sample of 186 PWH, Fellows et al.
(2014) found that SOP “fully mediated the effects of age on
learning, memory, and executive functioning and partially
mediated the effect of major depressive disorder on learning
and memory” (p. 806). Participants’ performance on the
everyday functioning measures and self-reported cognitive
complaints were not used in making any determination of
the cognitive domain chosen for training.
In step two, if participants did not have impairments in
either SOP or attention, they were assigned cognitive training targeting their least compromised (but still impaired)

demographically-adjusted mean); this was done specifically
so participants would no longer meet the clinical criteria of
HAND. In step three, participants were assigned to play
computerized modules that were selected specifically to
improve performance in their individually selected targeted
cognitive domains. We worked with participants to schedule
convenient times for them to complete their individual
training sessions at the research center. More information
about the cognitive training modules for each domain, can
[be found at www.brainhq.com and in our protocol article](http://www.brainhq.com)
(Vance et al., 2018).
Using a treatment adherence checklist, the neuropsychological testers monitored the amount of time participants
engaged in cognitive training for both targeted cognitive
domains. Also, the cognitive training software automatically
monitors the amount of time participants spend engaged in
each exercise. The correlation between the checklist and the
software on time engaged in training was very high
(r ¼ 0.935; p ¼ 0.001). To reduce participant burden, participants could engage in two hours of training at a time to
reduce the number of visits to the research center. Cognitive
training was conducted around 12 weeks, averaging
1.66 hours/week of cognitive training. In their meta-analysis
of 52 cognitive training studies, Lampit et al. (2014)
observed optimal therapeutic effects occurred when training
sessions are administered 1–3 times per week – dosage
parameters observed in the TOPS Study. In regards to dosage, we considered participants to be fully trained in each
domain when they successfully completed 7 out of 10 hours
of cognitive training, an approach similar to the seminal
ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent
and Vital Elderly) Study (N ¼ 2,802) (Ball et al., 2002).
When examining the actual potential of the cognitive training, such a completers-only analysis (n ¼ 41) is considered
appropriate. We had participants (n ¼ 7) who did not complete training; their data were included in an intent-totreat analysis.

Data analysis

The sample size considerations for the study were based on
feasibility and, as any pilot project (Leon et al., 2011), the
study was not powered for formal statistical inference.
Therefore, interpretation is based on in-sample measures of
effect size and results are considered exploratory. To produce fair comparisons between study groups across domains
of cognitive training, the same cognitive training assignment
algorithm was applied to participants in the control group
to determine the training they would have received if they
had been randomized to the individualized-training group
and hypothetically assigned training (Imbens & Ruvin,
2015). Analysis began by examining balance between study
groups with respect to baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race, HIV markers, etc.) using measures of effect size,
such as Cohen’s d (small �0.2, medium �0.5, large �0.8)
and Cramer’s V (small �0.1, medium �0.3, large �0.5, for
cross-tabulations comparing two groups) (Cohen, 1988).


group comparisons, regardless of their level of participation
in the study. Baseline characteristics were also examined for
association with attrition from the study. Next, for each of
the Everyday Functioning measures, descriptive statistics
were tabulated at the pre- and post-intervention time-points
by study group, and linear mixed-effects models with a random effect for subject were used to estimate the betweengroup difference in change from pre- to post-intervention,
using a time-by-group interaction coefficient. Following an
Intention-to-Treat approach, the models used all available
data at each time-point, and conceptually relevant baseline
characteristics associated with attrition were used as controlling covariates (age, years of education, and alcohol use) in
order to address bias resulting from missing data
(Groenwold et al., 2012). The variance components from
each model were used to estimate a pooled standard deviation for each everyday functioning measure, which was
then used to standardize the interaction coefficient and provide a measure of effect size (Cohen’s d). The Satterthwaite
approximation to degrees of freedom was used for significance tests of the interaction effect. Using baseline data of
all individuals screened for the study (N ¼ 135), Pearson
correlations between everyday functioning measures and
cognitive domain scores were estimated and interpreted
(small �0.1, medium �0.3, large �0.5) (Cohen, 1988).
Analyses were conducted using R software version 4.0.3 (R
Core Team, 2019).

Effects of training on everyday functioning

Using the ITT approach with posttest completers, Table 2
presents descriptive statistics and measures of training effect
on everyday functioning measures regardless of training
received (or hypothetically assigned for control participants).
A small beneficial effect was observed for the TIADL test (d
¼ �0.2) and the Simplified Medication Adherence
Questionnaire (d ¼ 0.17). Effects for other measures ranged
from no effect to trivial magnitude.

who received SOP training showed small improvements on
the Medication VAS (d ¼ 0.22) and the TIADL test (d ¼

who dropped from the study (n ¼ 21) and participants who
provided a posttest assessment (Table 5), those who dropped
from the study were more likely to be assigned to cognitive
training (n ¼ 16, 76.2% vs. n ¼ 48, 54.5%, V ¼ 0.17); tended
to be older (M[SD] ¼ 54.2[6.97] vs. 50.9[4.7], d ¼ 0.5);
tended to have more years of education (M[SD] ¼ 12.4[2.2]
vs. 11.4[2.6], d ¼ 0.46); tended to have slightly lower depression symptoms (CESD: M[SD] ¼ 17.54[10.7] vs. 20.7[9.6],
d ¼ 0.31); and tended to consume more alcohol (no. daily
drinks: M[SD] ¼ 1.8 [0.9] vs. 1.3[0.6], d ¼ 0.61). The characteristics with the largest magnitude of association with dropout (age, years of education, and alcohol use) were used as
adjusting covariates in models estimating results shown on
Tables 2 and 3.

##### Discussion

Overall, those who were assigned cognitive training experienced a small improvement on a speed-based everyday functioning task, the TIADL test, and the Simplified Medication
Adherence Questionnaire compared to those who had no
training. Yet, when examining specific types of cognitive
domain training, some findings were consistent with those
from previous studies, while others were inconsistent. As
such it is important to dissect and compare these findings
closely to the literature and results from the TOPS first aim
article (Vance, et al., in press). Based upon Wickens Model
of Information Processing and the Diminished SOP Theory
discussed earlier, both SOP training and attention training
were expected to exert the greatest cognitive benefits and
translation to everyday functioning improvements; indeed


such positive results. SOP training was associated with
improvements in the performance-based TIADL test and a
self-assessment of medication adherence (i.e., Medication
Adherence VAS). These findings are consistent with previous SOP training studies. Small improvement was observed
for the TIADL performance test in prior studies (Edwards
et al., 2005; Vance, Fazeli et al., 2012; Brien et al., 2013),
while the small-to-medium improvement on medication
adherence is a new finding, but not inconsistent with the
pattern of improved efficiency in everyday functioning.
Similarly, for attention training, small-medium improvement
was observed on self-ratings of BADL and IADL complaints.
Prior electrophysiological studies suggest that after such cognitive training, adults experience increased N200, N2c, and
P3b amplitudes (O’Brien et al., 2013; Zendel et al., 2016). It
is thought that both SOP and attention training uniquely
reduce dependence on prefrontal regions (an area commonly
susceptible to dysregulation in HIV; Melrose et al., 2008),
therefore strengthening functional connectivity in executive
function and visual attention in seronegative older adults
(Ross et al., 2019) and reallocating such response to posterior brain regions. This reallocation of processing is thought
to potentially reduce the need for top-down cognitive control that can improve both attention and SOP in older
adults and translate to everyday functional improvements
(O’Brien et al., 2013).
When examining the other cognitive training protocols,
the results are mixed as detrimental effects were found for
some everyday functioning outcomes. For example, detrimental effects, varying in magnitude, were repeatedly found
for subjective outcomes such as medication adherence and
ADL outcomes across the other training protocols. Cautious
interpretation is warranted for cognitive training protocols
as sample size was profoundly smaller than the SOP and


-----

To make sense of these findings, it is important to consider two germane points. First, the implicit hypothesis
underlying these cognitive training programs is that, cognitive training will improve cognitive ability in that domain
which will then translate to improved everyday functioning.
However, if there was a minimal amount of improvement in
the cognitive domain after training, then those findings
between cognitive training and everyday functioning outcomes should be censored, or at least interpreted with caution. In our parent study article, large beneficial effects were
observed for the SOP (d ¼ �0.88), executive function (d ¼
�0.89), and spatial learning and memory (d ¼ � 0.71)
domains. Medium to moderate beneficial effects were
observed for attention (d ¼ �0.45) and delayed spatial
memory (d ¼ �0.32). Trivial intervention effects were
observed for verbal learning and memory (d ¼ 0.1) and spatial visualization (d ¼ �0.06). A moderate detrimental effect
was observed for the delayed verbal memory (d ¼ 0.35).
Thus, by using a cutoff of d ¼ �0.45 or higher effect size,
only findings on SOP, attention, executive functioning, and
spatial learning and memory training results on everyday
functioning should be considered clinically meaningful.
Second, only one of the measures of everyday functioning
was performance-based (i.e., TIADL test) while all the others
were self-reported, subjective measures of everyday functioning. Perhaps these cognitive training protocols made people
more sensitive or observant of how they were not performing their everyday activities well. In that regard, some of
these changes in perceptions of everyday functioning may be
a result of the cognitive training, and the study itself focused
on everyday functioning (i.e., Hawthorne effect), increasing
the cognitive ability to be self-aware and overly or under
sensitive of how they are negotiating their self-care and their
environment, which might explain the various findings on
subjective everyday functioning.

Implications for practice

Combined with the neuroAIDS and cognitive aging literatures, several implications for practice emerge. First, as
many PWH age and experience cognitive impairments that
can restrict their everyday functioning, growing evidence
demonstrates that certain types of cognitive training, such as
SOP training and executive training can improve functioning in TIADLs as well as in driving and perhaps medication
adherence (Vance, Fazeli, Cheatwood, et al., 2019). A caveat
of this is that not all training protocols are the same. Some
cognitive training produces more cognitive benefits than
others, so the benefits may not be the same across all types
of cognitive training (Vance et al., in press). Therefore, clinician recommendations to patients to engage in such cognitive training should be measured, clearly stating the
advantages over some versions of cognitive training versus others.
Second, as PWH develop cognitive impairments including
HAND, this can create a concern and anxiety. In TOPS, we
informed participants of their HAND diagnosis and later


information (Vance, Jensen, et al., 2019). This qualitative
analysis revealed several themes including Sadness, Anxiety,
Unexpected, Concerned, Not Concerned/No Reaction; interestingly other themes emerged including Confirmation (selfrevelation of having cognitive impairment), Knowledge
Seeking, and Desire to Improve. Participants expressed fear
about HAND but also wanted to know more about how to
prevent or treat it; cognitive training may be an additional
tool, in combination with other positive health behaviors
such as physical exercise, to help address those concerns
and fears. Nevertheless, cognitive training may help PWH
assuage concerns about their cognitive and everyday
functioning.

Implications for research

From this study, several implications and future directions
for research are posited. First, additional studies on the
effects of cognitive training on everyday functioning should
incorporate more measures of objective, performance-based
everyday functioning such as the UCSD Performance-Based
Skills Assessment Brief (UPSA-B (Moore et al., 2017), especially measures that have more technology-related everyday
tasks (i.e., internet used, computer skills) would be of value
to modernize and extend the science (Vance et al., 2009).
For example, although the TIADL test is a performancebased instrument and has been shown to be sensitive to cognitive training in some studies, some of the items in it may
not be reflective of changes in modern everyday functioning.
On the TIADL test task of looking up a phone number in a
phone book, with proliferation of smart phones and other
handheld devices and widespread internet connectivity, phonebooks are obsolete. In a study of 93 participants with
PWH (43 with HAND) and 42 neurocognitive normal people without HIV, Woods et al. (2017) examined performance on internet-based household IADLs such as internet
shopping and banking. These researchers found that those
with HAND experienced lower internet-based task scores
and that such scores correlated with poorer motor skills,
executive function, numeracy, and episodic memory.
Second, in addition to cognitive training to improve
everyday functioning, training in everyday functioning skills
may also be a more direct way of doing this for PWH. For
example, in a sample of community-dwelling older adults,
Czaja et al. (2020) used both SOP training (i.e., UFOV[V]R

training) and a computer-based functional skills assessment
training (CFSAT) program in older adults with and without
cognitive impairments. Participants were assigned to either:
(1) CFSAT alone or (2) CFSAT plus SOP training.
Technological tasks were the focus of CFSAT which
included ATM banking, online shopping, ticket kiosk, interacting with a pharmacy website, and internet IADLs. Using
this training, researchers were able to improve everyday
functioning in both groups; however, 29% in the CFSAT
group achieved “mastery” while 32% those in the combined
intervention achieved “mastery.” Interesting CFSAT also
assesses such everyday functioning tasks and could be incor

-----

everyday skills, this in turn may improve cognitive abilities
as it has also been observed in other studies that show that
those who learn new skill (i.e., photography) experience
improvements in memory and other cognitive domains
(Vance et al., 2009).
Third, this study provided unique insights suggesting that
different cognitive training protocols may produce different
therapeutic benefits on everyday functioning. In fact, a combination of various cognitive training protocols may yield
the best therapeutic outcomes. In the TOPS study, 20 individualized combinations of training protocols were delivered; regrettably, with such a small sample size, it prevents a
meaningful comparison between training protocols. Future
studies could incorporate a multiphase optimization strategy
(MOST) design to determine which combination of training
provides the most therapeutic benefit (Collins, 2018). The
TOPS study provided a precursor to this approach, demonstrating that two cognitive training protocols can be administered simultaneously. By using the MOST design, this
approach could be conducted more systematically to examine this.

Strengths and limitations

All studies have methodological strengths and limitation;
this study is without exception. Four study strengths were
noted. First, standardized norm-based neuropsychological
measures were used to assess cognition and determine
HAND, which assists with generalizing the findings across
the literature. Second, a block randomization procedure was
utilized to control for race and gender. Third, standardized
cognitive training modules were employed. This ensured
that participants received the exact training within the cognitive domain they were assigned. And, fourth, five measures of subjective and/or objective everyday functioning
were used.
These strengths are related to some of the limitations
observed in this study. First, although by no means exhaustive, the measures of everyday functioning represent a range
in which to examine the impact of cognitive training on
everyday functioning; there are clearly other more real world
and current measures of everyday functioning that were not
taken into consideration. Second, despite using standardized
neuropsychological measures, no true cognitive domain tests
exist. Although cognitive domain tests are carefully designed
to minimized reliance on other cognitive domains to complete a test, even some minor cognitive function in other
domains is recruited such that a cognitive measure is actually measuring some aspect of other cognitive abilities (i.e.,
spillover effect). Third, and similarly, just as there is spillover with cognitive tests, there is spillover with cognitive
training in that there is no “pure” cognitive domain training.
In fact, with the design of this study, the training effects are
inter-related between particular cognitive domains depending on which cognitive domains were trained in conjunction
by each individual. Fourth, this was not a longitudinal study.
Some of the changes from cognitive training may take


have also impacted the cognitive training effect such as years
with HIV (long-term survival), cognitive reserve, sleep
hygiene, and past/current substance use; these were not
accounted for in analyses. Finally, our sample expressed a
high degree of depressive symptomatology which could have
had an individual effect on each cognitive training protocol;
unfortunately, with the small sample size, it was not feasible
to look at the effect of this variable on each of the nine
training conditions.

##### Conclusion

In summary, this study was the first to administer a combination of cognitive training protocols in an individualized
manner tailored to the participants’ cognitive performance
with the goal of improving everyday functioning and reducing HAND. Once the cognitive effect size of each sub-study
was considered, it appears that some performance-based and
subjective measures of everyday functioning were improved.
Observing cognitive training effects in SOP, attention, and
executive functioning specifically, a future cognitive protocol
incorporating all three components may prove to be the
most optimal combination to improve subjective and objective everyday functioning; in fact, the MOST protocol may
be a novel way to investigate moving this science forward.
Albeit, more research and consensus is needed to determine
how to effectively measure everyday functioning, as current
objective and subjective measures come with their own
strengths and limitations that directly impact clinical practice and effectiveness.
