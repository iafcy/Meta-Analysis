### Abstract


Neurocognitive impairment (NCI) remains a persistent complication of HIV disease that nearly
half of persons with HIV experience, and rates are even higher in persons who use substances such
as cocaine. Cognitive training is a promising intervention for HIV-associated NCI. In this
randomized controlled trial, we examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a web-based
cognitive training program to improve working memory in a sample of 58 persons with HIV and
cocaine use disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to either the experimental working
memory training arm or the attention control training arm and completed up to 48 daily sessions
over 10 weeks. Overall, treatment completion (74%) and retention rates (97%) were high, and
participant feedback indicated the intervention was acceptable. Our results show that the
intervention successfully reduced working memory deficits in the experimental arm relative to the
control arm. Our findings support both the feasibility and effectiveness of cognitive training in this
population.

### INTRODUCTION

Among the 1.1 million Americans living with HIV, prevalence estimates indicate that up to
half will develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) in their lifetime (1, 2).
With the effectiveness of modern combination antiretroviral therapies (cART), the rates of
severe HAND have declined, but milder forms remain a persistent complication of HIV
disease (2-4). The neurocognitive impairment (NCI) associated with these milder forms of

HAND can lead to concomitant impairments in real-world functioning, including driving
ability, employment, and medication adherence (5-9). While effective cART regimens can
reduce the effects of HIV on the central nervous system (10), behavioral interventions are
needed to address the mild and moderate NCI that now predominate the clinical presentation
of neuroHIV.

The abuse of illicit stimulant drugs like cocaine appears to increase the risk of HAND.
Cocaine use, like other drugs of abuse, is disproportionately common among persons with
HIV in the United States. In a nationally representative sample of adults, the prevalence of
cocaine use in persons with HIV was 58% for lifetime and 13% for past year compared to
16% and 2%, respectively, in persons without HIV (11). Among persons with HIV, cocaine
use is associated with poorer HIV clinical outcomes, including unsuppressed HIV viral load,
faster disease progression, and mortality (12-15). Cocaine is also a concern due to its effect
on the brain. As a powerfully addictive drug, chronic cocaine use causes persistent
neurobiological changes in neural networks that control reward salience, executive control,
and decision making (16-18). Behaviorally, cocaine users demonstrate prominent
impairments in working memory (19-21). Case-control studies have demonstrated the
additive and interactive effects of cocaine and HIV on neurocognitive functioning,
particularly in the domains of executive function and working memory (22-24).


Working memory may be a key target for improving cognitive function in persons with HIV.
Working memory involves the temporary storage and manipulation of information from the
current environment to support complex cognitive tasks, such as comprehension, reasoning,
and decision making (25). As a core executive function that supports self-regulation (26),
working memory plays an important role in daily functioning. Cognitive training, which
harnesses the brain’s inherent capacities for change, may be an effective intervention for
improving working memory function. Cognitive training promotes or restores adaptive
cognitive, socio-affective, and behavioral functioning by targeting underlying neural
processes using controlled learning events, such as skills exercises that get progressively
more challenging as performance improves (27, 28). While cognitive training originally
emerged as a treatment for the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, it has since
been successfully utilized to improve cognitive functions in a multitude of other conditions,
including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, major depression, and anorexia nervosa
(28-33).

Though still a relatively new area of research, a recent systematic review concluded that the
studies to date examining the effects of cognitive training in adults with HIV have shown
promising results in improving cognitive function (34).These studies naturally had some
methodological variability and limitations, including different types of comparison groups,
limited sample sizes, and brief follow-up periods, but collectively they indicate cognitive
training as a viable intervention for HIV-associated NCI (34). Most studies delivered
approximately 10 hours of cognitive training, which is consistent with the standard in the
broader cognitive training literature; however, it is not yet clear whether an increased dosage
of training would benefit HIV-associated NCI (34). Of note, in these studies, substance use
was either exclusionary or was not explicitly characterized. While the potential benefits of
cognitive training for substance abuse remain understudied (35), several working memory

interventions across different substance use populations have yielded promising results on
working memory performance and impulsive decision making (36-39). However, the
potential benefit of cognitive training for improving working memory in persons with HIV
who use substances has not yet been evaluated.


This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of a web-based cognitive training
intervention to improve working memory in persons living with HIV and cocaine use
disorder. Participants in this randomized clinical trial were assigned to either the
experimental working memory training arm or the attention control training arm.
Participants completed 10 weeks of training, with assessments at baseline and post-treatment
to evaluate treatment effects. We hypothesized that participants receiving the working
memory training would show greater improvements in working memory performance over
time relative to participants in the control arm.

### METHODS


**Procedures**


We recruited adults with HIV aged 18–64 years old and residing independently in the
community who reported a history of regular cocaine use. The key cocaine-related eligibility
criteria were regular cocaine use lasting >1 year and lifetime cocaine-type stimulant use
disorder. Participants also had to be on an antiretroviral (ARV) medication for >3 months at
the time of enrollment. The exclusion criteria were: English non-fluency or illiteracy; ≤ 8th
grade education; serious and unstable neurological or psychiatric disorders; impaired mental
status; and pregnancy. To maximize generalizability, there were no exclusions related to
other substance use, such as alcohol, marijuana, or other illicit drugs.

From March 2017 to November 2018, participants were recruited through flyers and
brochures at infectious diseases clinics, a research contact registry, and peer referrals.
Potential participants completed a brief prescreening interview to assess preliminary
eligibility. Participants then attended an in-person screening to assess eligibility more
comprehensively.


Eligible participants returned on another day to complete a baseline assessment that included
a neuropsychological battery. After the baseline assessment, participants were randomly
assigned to one of two arms: active cognitive training (ACT) or control training (CON). This
intervention utilized Lumosity’s web-based cognitive training games (Lumos Labs, Inc.;
[http://www.lumosity.com). Games in ACT targeted working memory, while games in CON](http://www.lumosity.com/)
targeted other domains, such as motor function and processing speed. For randomization,
randomly-ordered blocks of 6, 8, or 10 were generated by the principal investigator using a
permuted block design with a random number generator in Sealed Envelope (40).
Assignments were then placed in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes that were locked
in the principal investigator’s office. Random assignment was completed by the training
administrator (TA), who was a designated staff member responsible for monitoring
participant progress during the intervention phase. The TA retrieved the next available sealed
envelope and broke the seal at the time of randomization.

Participants then completed a tutorial session with the TA in which they received an
overview of the web-based cognitive training program and each game they would be playing
through the program. The TA ensured that the participant understood each game and was
comfortable navigating the website. In addition, if the participant reported having limited or
no access to a computer and/or internet at their residence, they were offered a Chromebook
and hotspot device to use for the duration of the intervention.

The structure of the intervention phase was identical for the ACT and CON arms.
Participants had up to 10 weeks at home to complete up to 48 cognitive training sessions.
After 10 weeks, or within 1 week of completing the 48[th] session (whichever occurred first),
participants completed a post-intervention follow-up assessment to evaluate the effects of the
intervention. For both the baseline and post-intervention visits, the research assistant
conducting the neuropsychological testing and clinical interviews was blind to arm
assignment, in order to prevent any biases during neuropsychological testing.


Participants were compensated for all study assessments, receiving $50 for the screen, $75
for the baseline, and $65 for the post-intervention visit. Participants earned $2 for every
completed session, and, to encourage session completion, they earned an escalating bonus
after the completion of every 6[th] session ($5 bonus after completing 6, 12, 18, and 24
sessions; $10 after 30 and 36 sessions; and $15 after 42 and 48 sessions). Total potential
earnings for completing all 48 sessions was $166. Payments for session completion were
disbursed each time a bonus was earned and at the end of 10 weeks, if the participant did not
complete all 48 sessions. All payments were provided using a reloadable debit card.

Procedures were approved by the institutional review board at Duke University Health
[System and the study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02909101).](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)
Participants provided written informed consent. Figure 1 shows the flow of participants from
the eligibility screening through the post-intervention follow-up. In total, 81 individuals
enrolled and completed an in-depth screening. Of these, 67 (83%) were eligible and 58
(72%) completed the baseline assessment.


**Screening measures**

**Substance use.—We administered several clinical interviews to comprehensively assess**
substance use history. The Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-L), a semi-structured
interview, assessed lifetime substance use and associated problems (41). Module E of the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) assessed clinical symptoms of substance
use disorders (42). To measure frequency of use in the past 90 days, we utilized Timeline
follow-back (TLFB) methodology to record days of use for cocaine and other substances
(43, 44). A rapid urine toxicology screen that tested for cocaine, cannabis, amphetamine,
methamphetamine, oxycodone, methadone, other opioids, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates
was conducted to corroborate self-report of recent substance use.


**Other interviews and questionnaires.—Modules A and B from the SCID-5 assessed**
mood and psychotic disorders. To assess literacy, participants completed the Word Reading
Subtest of the Wide Range Achievement Test-4 (45). Questionnaires to assess demographic
factors (such as age, race, and ethnicity) were administered using audio computer-assisted

self-interview (ACASI). A urine pregnancy test was completed for persons of childbearing
potential.

Finally, participants provided authorization for the release of their medical records for both
current and historical care. Research staff reviewed records to ensure the absence of any
exclusionary history, including unstable neurological conditions or psychiatric disorders.
HIV clinical variables were also abstracted, including date of HIV diagnosis, ARV
treatment, most recent CD4 count and HIV viral load, and nadir CD4 count.


**Baseline measures**

**Substance use.—Frequency of substance use in the past 90 days was assessed via TLFB**
and another rapid urine toxicology screen was conducted.


**Neuropsychological assessment.—Participants completed the Wechsler Test of Adult**
Reading (WTAR), a word reading task that includes words with atypical grapheme to
phoneme translations, to estimate premorbid verbal IQ (46). Participants then completed a
60-minute battery that was designed to align with recommendations for assessing HIVassociated neurocognitive impairment (47). This battery assessed the following 7 domains of
function:

**1.** Working memory: Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task-50 – number correct
(48); WAIS-IV Digit Span subtest – number correct (49); WAIS-IV LetterNumber Sequencing subtest – number correct (49)


**2.** Processing speed: Trail Making Test Part A – number of seconds to completion
(50); Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) Coding subtest – total
number correct (49); Stroop Color and Word Test color naming score – number
of items completed (51)

**3.** Learning (immediate recall): Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT-R)
– total number of words recalled on trials 1-3 (52); Brief Visuospatial Memory
Test-Revised (BVMT-R) – total score for figures correctly recalled on trials 1-3
(53)


**4.** Memory (delayed recall): HVLT-R – number of words recalled on trial 4 (52);
BVMT-R – total score for figures correctly recalled on trial 4 (53)

**5.** Executive function: Stroop Color and Word Test interference score – difference
between actual and predicted score on the Color-Word trial (51); Trail Making
Test Part B – number of seconds to completion (50); Wisconsin Card Sorting
Test-64 (WCST) – total errors (54)


**6.** Verbal fluency: FAS letter fluency – number of words generated; and category
fluency – number of animals generated (55)

**7.** Motor skills: Grooved Pegboard Test dominant and non-dominant hand –
number of seconds to completion (56)


Raw scores for each test were converted to demographically corrected T-scores (M=50,
SD=10) using published normative data (48, 49, 57). To compute severity of impairment, T

scores were converted to deficit scores using a 0-5 rating, with 0 reflecting no impairment
and 5 reflecting severe impairment: T ≥40 = 0, 35-39 = 1, 30-34 = 2, 25-29 = 3, 20-24 = 4,
and <20 = 5. A mean domain deficit score (DDS) was then computed by averaging the
deficit scores for the tests within each domain. By assigning a zero-point value to T scores
within or above one standard deviation of the mean, deficit scores give less weight to
performances that are within normal limits and therefore provide a more accurate
characterization of impairment than simply averaging T scores. A global deficit score (GDS)
was computed by averaging the DDS of the 7 domains. Overall impairment within a domain
was defined as a mean DDS ≥0.5 and global impairment was defined as GDS > 0.5 (58).


**Intervention arms**

Games for each arm were selected based on the designated domain of function identified by
Lumosity. Games selected for ACT specifically designated working memory as the focal
brain attribute for the game, whereas games selected for CON specifically did not designate
working memory or other aspects of memory function. Games increased in difficulty as the
participant played. For example, the number of items a participant needed to remember or
the speed of stimulus presentation increased across trials. Details about each game are
presented in Appendix 1. Participants could complete one session per day and each session
lasted 20-30 minutes. Each session included a random selection of 4 of the possible games,
and each game was played twice back-to-back. After completing each game twice,
participants had the option to play the same game an unlimited number of additional times
or move on to the next game, until they cycled through all 4 games for that session.


The TA received daily data reports from Lumosity to monitor participant progress. The
reports detailed which games were completed, when they were completed, and the scores for
each game. Participants received a check-in call whenever they went more than 2 days
without completing a session. During check-ins, the TA answered any participant questions
and assisted in troubleshooting technical issues as needed. Participants also received a call
after completing every 6[th] session. During this call, participants were encouraged to continue
completing sessions and they were also informed that a payment for that block of sessions,
including the bonus, would be loaded onto their debit card.

**Intervention engagement metrics.—For each participant, we computed the overall**
number of sessions completed to evaluate feasibility. Treatment completion was defined as
≥75% of sessions (36 out of 48). However, because some participants may not have been
actively engaged with the game content while completing sessions, we examined game
scores to check whether participants improved over time, as proxy of engagement. We
computed the overall number of games where scores improved over time (ranging from 0 to
8). Improved performance on a game over time was defined as the average of the final six
scores on a game being greater than the average of the first six scores on that game. If a
participant completed a game fewer than 12 times during the intervention period, change
over time could not be evaluated and that participant’s performance for that game was
therefore categorized as not improved.

**Follow-up procedures**

The post-intervention evaluation repeated the full baseline assessment as well as a follow-up
version of the ASI-L. Participants also completed an intervention process assessment (IPA)
at this visit to evaluate their experiences with the intervention, including perceived benefits
of sessions, barriers to doing sessions, and feedback about the frequency, length, and number
of sessions. Participants read statements about the intervention and rated their level of
agreement with each statement on a 5-point scale. Participants provided ratings for their
general satisfaction with sessions (1 = Very dissatisfied, 2 = Somewhat dissatisfied, 3 =
Neutral, 4 = Somewhat satisfied, 5 = Very satisfied) and how helpful they found sessions
overall (1 = Very unhelpful, 2 = Somewhat unhelpful, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Somewhat helpful, 5
= Very helpful). Acceptability was defined as ratings of >3.5 on the 5-point scales for
satisfaction and helpfulness. To encourage participants to provide both positive and critical
feedback, the IPA was administered using ACASI.


**Data analysis plan**

Analyses were conducted using SPSS 26.0.0.0. To characterize the sample and test for
potential failures of randomization, we utilized chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests,
independent samples t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare the ACT and CON arms.
To examine feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, chi-square and independent
samples t-tests were used to examine group differences on session completion metrics and
the IPA questionnaire responses. Using an intent-to-treat analysis, we examined the
differential effects of treatment arm on the primary outcome of working memory (domain
deficit score) by conducting a 2 (Arm: ACT vs. CON) × 2 (Time: Baseline vs. Follow-up)
mixed-model general linear model analysis. Time was the within-subjects factor defined by
baseline versus follow-up, and study arm was the between-subjects factor. Age, estimated
premorbid IQ (WTAR standard score), and number of games improved (a proxy of
intervention engagement) were included as covariates in the model. To examine the
specificity of the cognitive training intervention, we used the same models to test for
differences on performance in other cognitive domains. Statistical significance was defined
as p-value of <0.05.


### RESULTS

**Sample characteristics**


In the final sample of 58 adults, 29 participants were randomized to each arm. Participants
were 48.62 (SD = 9.15) years old with 11.97 (SD = 2.37) years of education on average. The
majority of participants were male (72%) and African American (86%). All participants
were currently engaged in HIV care. The mean number of years since HIV diagnosis was
15.90 (SD = 7.53), and the most recent HIV viral load was suppressed at <50 copies/mL for
83% of participants. The median most recent CD4 cell count was 633.50 (IQR = 395.00)
and the median nadir CD4 was 158.00 (IQR = 346.00). Table 1 compares the study arms on
key characteristics. There were no significant differences on any demographic, HIV, or
substance use characteristics, indicating that randomization was effective. The majority of
participants (62%) in both arms had GDS scores indicating impairment [χ[2](1) = 0.29, p =
0.59]. The only difference between arms on baseline neuropsychological testing was that

participants in CON had higher impairment scores in the motor skills domain relative to
participants in ACT.


**Feasibility and acceptability**

A total of 43 (74%) participants were loaned computer equipment for the trial, with 42
(72%) using a Chromebook and 28 (48%) utilizing a hotspot, and there was no difference on
equipment usage by arm [χ[2](1) = 0.81, p = 0.37], Session completion metrics are
summarized in Figure 1. Participants completed 37.33 (SD = 18.53) of the 48 possible
sessions on average [t(56) = −1.35, p = 0.18]. The majority of participants (59%) completed
all 48 sessions, 16% completed 36-47 sessions, 16% completed 2-35 sessions, and 10%
completed only one session [χ[2](3) = 2.25, p = 0.52]. There was no difference in treatment
completion by arm for any metric.


Ratings from the process assessment are presented in Table 2. Participants agreed that they
completed sessions because they believed the sessions would be helpful to them (M = 4.20,
SD = 0.64). However, while participants in ACT were generally neutral about payment as a
motivator for completing sessions, participants in CON were significantly more likely to
agree that they completed sessions because they knew they would be paid. Objectively,
participants in CON had a greater number of games with improved scores over time relative
to ACT participants [M = 6.59, SD = 2.68 and M = 4.79, SD = 2.97, respectively; t(56) =
−2.41, p = 0.02]. In terms of participants’ own perceptions, though, participants in ACT
agreed more strongly than CON participants that their performance improved over time.

Mean ratings for overall satisfaction (M = 4.09, SD = 1.21) and perceived helpfulness (M =
4.09, SD = 1.08) of the intervention were both above the 3.5 cut-off, indicating that
acceptability was high. Participants across both arms agreed that the games were fun (M =
4.00, SD = 0.95) and challenging (M = 4.07, SD = 0.78). Participants also disagreed that the
games were too difficult (M = 2.43, SD = 1.02), though there was trend for ACT participants
to feel more neutral about this statement.


There were no differences by arm in evaluating the structure of the intervention. Participants
found playing games twice back-to-back was helpful (M = 3.88, SD = 1.01). They felt the
length of each session (M = 3.05, SD = 0.59) and the number of sessions overall (M = 2.91,
SD = 0.79) were “just right.” They also disagreed that it was difficult to complete 5-6
sessions per week (M = 2.25, SD = 1.15) or to complete sessions for 10 weeks (M = 2.21,
SD = 1.16).


**Post-intervention outcomes**

Retention in the trial was high, with 97% completing the post-intervention follow-up, and
there were no differences by arm in attrition [Fisher’s test, p = 1.000]. One participant from
each arm was lost to follow-up (one moved out of state and the other went to a long-term
residential treatment program).


In the 2 (Arm) × 2 (Time) mixed-model general linear model, there was a significant groupby-time interaction for the working memory DDS with a medium effect size [F(1, 51) =
4.47, p = 0.04, ηp[2] = 0.08], such that ACT had greater improvements relative to CON

AIDS Behav. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 May 01.


-----

(Figure 2). From baseline to follow-up, ACT working memory DDS decreased from 0.29

[standard error (SE) = 0.09] to 0.14 (SE = 0.07), whereas CON scores increased from 0.21
(SE = 0.09) to 0.26 (SE = 0.07). There were no significant main effects for time or arm-bytime interaction effects for other cognitive domains with all p > 0.05. There were main
effects for group on both motor [F(1, 51) = 8.25, p = 0.01, ηp[2] = 0.14] and fluency DDS

[F(1, 51) = 4.96, p = 0.03, ηp[2] = 0.09]. Consistent with baseline scores, DDS was lower in
ACT relative to CON for motor (ACT M = 0.26, SE = 0.17; CON M = 0.98, SE = 0.17) and
fluency (ACT M = 0.10, SE = 0.08; CON M = 0.38, SE = 0.08). Overall, these results
suggest that the intervention effect was specific to working memory.


### DISCUSSION

This randomized controlled trial supports the acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of a
web-based cognitive training program to improve working memory in persons with HIV
who use cocaine. Participants’ ratings for both satisfaction and helpfulness were high, and
the large majority completed at least 36 sessions over 10 weeks. In support of our
hypothesis, the intent-to-treat analyses revealed differential effects by study arm on working
memory over time, with deficit scores decreasing in ACT but increasing in CON. Moreover,
the intervention effects were specific to working memory. Given that the training sessions
are fully computerized and administered by participants at home on their own schedule, this
promising intervention could be easily integrated into HIV services.


A key finding of our study is that web-based cognitive training was feasible to implement in
this sample of persons with HIV, most of whom were actively using cocaine. Participants
across both arms indicated that the number of sessions and the duration of the intervention
overall were acceptable, and their general response to the web-based program and its content
was positive. However, given limited financial resources, many of our participants did not
have internet and computer access. As such, providing Chromebooks and mobile hotspots
was key to facilitating engagement. Additionally, because many participants required basic
computer instruction and assistance during the trial, the tutorial session and the availability
of a staff member for technical troubleshooting throughout the intervention were important
for ensuring treatment completion.

Our results suggest that participants in the ACT arm developed internal motivation to
complete the sessions. On the process measure, participants in CON agreed that payment
motivated their session completion, whereas ACT participants were neutral to this statement.
This finding is intriguing, given that CON participants had a greater number of games with
improved scores compared to ACT participants, which suggests that they were engaged
while completing sessions. Ultimately, these differences may be related to the difficulty of
the games in ACT relative to those in CON. Because the ACT arm targeted working
memory, those games likely required more cognitive effort and objectively were more
difficult than the CON games, which required only simple set-shifting or processing speed.
Indeed, participants’ perceptions support this idea. All participants felt the games were
challenging, but ACT participants perceived the games to be more difficult than their CON
counterparts.

Building upon on the growing literature on the efficacy of cognitive training in persons
living with HIV (34), our study provides the first examination of cognitive training in
persons with HIV who use substances, a group that is at particularly high risk for NCI. A
major strength of this trial was the attention-matched comparison group, in which
participants completed an equivalent number and intensity of games that differed only in the
cognitive skills that were targeted. In addition, our experimental design utilized a
comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included multiple tests for each domain of
function, and our retention rates for the post-intervention follow-up were excellent. Our
study does has several limitations that should be noted. First, our follow-up occurred right
after the intervention was completed. Therefore, our findings represent only the short-term
effects of the intervention. A longer follow-up period would be necessary to determine the
long-term durability of effects. Second, our assessment did not include an evaluation of
functional impairment, which would be important in examining the real-world impact of the
intervention. Future studies should include a detailed evaluation of functional impairment
pre- and post-treatment. Finally, due to the experimental design of the two arms, the
intervention had to be delivered on a computer. As the intervention is rolled out for
implementation on a smartphone or tablet, whose portability would allow more flexibility in
both timing and location of completing sessions, engagement in the sessions may be further
enhanced. A recent study supports the acceptability of mHealth interventions among people
with HIV who use cocaine (59).

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of webbased cognitive training for improving working memory in persons with co-occurring HIV
infection and cocaine use disorder. Cognitive training is an exciting avenue to pursue in HIV
care because it is relatively low cost and scalable in resource-limited settings with few
mental health specialists. A larger trial with a longer duration of training and targeting more
domains is needed to test the durability of effects and improvement in daily living.
