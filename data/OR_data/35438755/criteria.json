            "criteria": "In accordance with the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline (Figure 1),8 2 authors (S.B.A. and P.L.) independently searched the bibliographic databases (Embase, Ovid, MEDLINE, and Scopus) and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov) from inception through March 1, 2020. Published trials fulfilling the PICO criteria (Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) were included. Participants included adult patients with any cancer. The intervention included treatment with anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 and/or anti-CTLA4 drugs. The comparison included drug regimens that used monotherapy or a combination of chemotherapy, targeted therapy, vaccines, or any medication used to treat that cancer. Trials using placebo or supportive care were also included in the comparison arm. Outcomes included NAEs of any grade or type. Only phase II and III randomized control trials (RCTs) comparing single or dual ICI with the standard of care or placebo were selected. Only those studies where full-text articles were available were screened for the final analysis. In the event of multiple publications from the same trial, only those with the largest sample size were included in our analysis. Any trials whose results were not published in a peer-reviewed journal were excluded. All databases were searched for publications containing anti\u2013PD-1/PD-L1 or anti\u2013CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors by using the search string: ipilimumab OR tremelimumab OR nivolumab OR pembrolizumab OR MED10680 OR AMP-224 OR pidilizumab OR atezolimab OR MED14736 OR avelumab OR BMS-936559 AND durvalumab OR MEDI4736. Two independent reviewers (P.F. and A.M.) examined all selected studies, and disagreements were resolved with mutual consensus or third-party review (M.Z.F.).",
