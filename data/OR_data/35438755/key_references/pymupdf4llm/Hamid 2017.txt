Abstract Aim: To evaluate the protocol-specified final analysis of overall survival (OS) in the
KEYNOTE-002 study (NCT01704287) of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients
with ipilimumab-refractory, advanced melanoma.
Methods: In this randomised, phase II study, eligible patients had advanced melanoma with
documented progression after two or more ipilimumab doses, previous BRAF or MEK
inhibitor or both, if BRAF[V600] mutant-positive. Patients were randomised to pembrolizumab
2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks or investigator-choice chemotherapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab was allowed following progression on chemotherapy. The protocol-specified final
OS was performed in the intent-to-treat population. Survival was positive if p < 0.01 in one
pembrolizumab arm.
Results: A total of 180 patients were randomised to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 181 to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and 179 to chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 28 months (range 24.1e35.5),
368 patients died and 98 (55%) crossed over to pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (hazard
ratio[HR]0.86, 95% confidenceinterval [CI]0.67e1.10, p Z 0.117) and10 mg/kg (0.74, 0.57e0.96,
p Z 0.011) resulted in a non-statistically significant improvement in OS versus chemotherapy; median OS was 13.4 (95% CI 11.0e16.4) and 14.7 (95% CI 11.3e19.5), respectively, versus 11.0
months (95% CI8.9e13.8),withlimited improvement after censoring for crossover.Two-year survival rates were 36% and 38%, versus 30%. Progression-free survival, objective response rate and
duration of response improved with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy, regardless of dose.
Grade IIIeV treatment-related adverse events occurred in 24 (13.5%), 30 (16.8%) and 45
(26.3%) patients, respectively.
Conclusion: Improvement in OS with pembrolizumab was not statistically significant at either
dose versus chemotherapy.

1. Introduction

The introduction of targeted therapy with BRAF and
MEK inhibitors and checkpoint inhibitors improved
survival outcomes in patients with advanced, metastatic
melanoma [1e4]. Ipilimumab potentiates the antitumour
response by blocking signalling through the inhibitory
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated (CTLA-4) receptor
expressed on activated T cells [5] and improves response
rates and survival in patients with advanced melanoma,
regardless of the BRAF mutation status [6]. At the time
of this study, BRAF plus MEK inhibitors (in patients
with BRAF-mutated melanoma) and ipilimumab were
the standard-of-care as front-line therapies for treatment
of advanced melanoma [3,4]. When patients progressed
after treatment with BRAF or MEK inhibitors or ipilimumab, their systemic treatment options were limited, as
no agent had shown survival advantage in this setting.
The monoclonal anti-programmed cell death (PD-1)
antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have shown
clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma [7e13].
Treatment with nivolumab improved objective
response but not progression-free survival (PFS) or
overall survival (OS) with fewer side-effects versus
chemotherapy in patients with ipilimumab-refractory,
advanced melanoma in CheckMate 037 [14,15]. In the
protocol-specified second interim analysis of the phase
II KEYNOTE-002 study of pembrolizumab versus
investigator-choice chemotherapy for ipilimumabrefractory advanced melanoma, pembrolizumab


improved objective response and PFS versus chemotherapy with a favourable safety profile. The
KEYNOTE-006 study of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in patients with advanced melanoma showed
that PFS, OS and overall response rates (ORRs) were
superior with pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab and led
to the approval of pembrolizumab for the treatment of
advanced melanoma in the front-line setting [12,13].
Here, we present results of the protocol-specified, eventdriven final OS analysis of KEYNOTE-002.

2. Patients and methods

2.1. Study design

KEYNOTE-002 (NCT01704287) was an international,
randomised, controlled, phase II study comparing the
efficacy and safety of two doses of pembrolizumab with
investigator-choice chemotherapy in patients with
advanced melanoma refractory to ipilimumab [13]. The
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. All patients provided written, informed
consent. The protocol and amendments were approved
by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee
at participating institutions.

2.2. Patients and treatment

Study criteria for KEYNOTE-002 were published previously [13]. Briefly, patients were randomly assigned


-----

1:1:1 to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab
10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks (Q3W) or
investigator-choice chemotherapy (carboplatin [eliminated with protocol amendment one], carboplatin plus
paclitaxel, dacarbazine, paclitaxel alone or oral temozolomide). Randomisation was stratified by the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(0 or 1), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (normal or
elevated [ 110% upper limit of normal]) and BRAF
�
mutational status (wild type or V600 mutant). Patients
and investigators were masked only to the pembrolizumab dose. Additional details in Appendix.
The co-primary efficacy end-point was OS (time from
randomisation to death). An updated summary of the coprimary efficacy end-point PFS, (time from randomisation to first documented disease progression [PD] per
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours

[RECIST], version 1.1 by an independent central review

[IRC]), was included as a supportive analysis. Secondary
end-points included ORR (proportion of patients with
complete response [CR] or partial response [PR] per
RECIST, version 1.1 by IRC), duration of response (DOR

[time from first CR or PR until PD or death]), safety.
Details of all end-points were published previously [13].

2.3. Assessments

Tumour response assessments were performed during
screening (baseline), week 12 and then Q6W until week
48. After week 48, assessments were performed every 3
months. During follow-up, survival was assessed Q12W.
Additional details in Appendix.

2.4. Statistical analyses

Protocol-specified analysis of OS was to be performed
after 370 deaths across all groups. With 370 deaths
and assuming a median OS of 6 months with
chemotherapy and a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.65 for
comparison of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy,
the study had 90% power to detect a difference in OS for
at least one pembrolizumab group, using the Hochberg
testing procedure at a one-sided alpha of 2% at final
analysis [16]. Statistical analyses were done with SAS
(version 9.3). Efficacy was assessed in the intent-to-treat
population. Safety was assessed in all patients who
received 1 dose of study treatment. KaplaneMeier
�
methods were used to estimate PFS, OS and DOR.
Additional details in Appendix.

3. Results

From 30th November 2012 to 13th November 2013, 540
patients were randomised to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg
Q3W (n Z 180), 10 mg/kg Q3W (n Z 181) or chemotherapy (n Z 179). Patient characteristics were well


balanced, and most patients had two or more prior lines
of therapy and visceral metastases (Table 1) [13]. At data
cut-off of 16th November 2015, median duration of
follow-up was 28 months (range 24.1e35.5) and treatment was ongoing for 17 (9%) patients with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 31 (17%) with pembrolizumab
10 mg/kg; no patients were receiving chemotherapy.
Ninety-eight of 179 (55%) patients in the chemotherapy
arm crossed over to pembrolizumab (Appendix); median
follow-up duration for these patients was 28.1 months
(range 24.5e35.5). Including the crossover population, at
least one line of subsequent anticancer therapy was
received by 80 (44%) patients who discontinued pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 54 (30%) who discontinued pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and 57 (32%) who discontinued
chemotherapy, including 34 (6%) who received ipilimumab re-induction, 50 (9%) who were re-treated with
BRAF/MEK inhibitors and 61 (11%) patients who
received chemotherapy (Appendix). In addition, six (3%)
patients who discontinued chemotherapy received subsequent antiePD-1 or antiePD-L1 therapy versus nine
(5%) and two (1%) patients who discontinued pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively.
At final analysis 368 patients had died. Survival
improved with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.86, 95%
confidence interval [CI] 0.67e1.10; p Z 0.117) and
10 mg/kg (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57e0.96; p Z 0.011)
versus chemotherapy, although the pre-specified
threshold for significance of p < 0.01 for a single pembrolizumab arm over chemotherapy was not reached.
There was no difference in OS between the pembrolizumab doses (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.67e1.12;
p Z 0.290). Median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI,
11.0e16.4) and 14.7 months (95% CI 11.3e19.5) with
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively,
versus 11.0 months (95% CI 8.9e13.8) with chemotherapy (Fig. 1). Two-year OS rates were 36% (95% CI
28.9e43.0), 38% (95% CI 31.1e45.2) and 30% (95% CI
23.0e36.7) with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and
chemotherapy, respectively. Adjusting for crossover had
limited effect on OS in patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58e1.08) or
10 mg/kg (0.67, 0.49e0.92; Fig. 2). OS was consistent
across all protocol-specified subgroups, including those
with 0e1 or 2 prior therapies, visceral metastases and
�
regardless of PD-L1 expression (Fig. 3).
With a total of 466 PFS events (RECIST, version 1.1,
IRC) at final analysis, PFS improved with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46e0.73;
p < 0.0001) and 10 mg/kg (0.47, 0.37e0.60; p < 0.0001)
versus chemotherapy, confirming the PFS benefit reported at the second interim analysis. Estimated 2-year
PFS was 16% (95% CI 10.9e22.1) and 22% (95% CI
16.1e28.3) with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg,
respectively, versus 0.6% (95% CI 0.1e3.2) with
chemotherapy.

The ORR (RECIST, version 1.1, by IRC) was 22%
and 28% in 40 and 50 patients receiving pembrolizumab
2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, versus 4% in eight
patients receiving chemotherapy (p < 0.0001 for both
pembrolizumab doses versus chemotherapy). There was
no difference between the pembrolizumab doses
(p Z 0.214). At median follow-up of 28 months, 20
(50%) of 40 responders to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 29
(58%) of 50 responders to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and
one (13%) of eight responders to chemotherapy were
alive and progression free, without subsequent anticancer therapy. Median DOR was 22.8 months (range
1.4 to 25.3 ) with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and was
þ þ
not reached (range 1.1 to 28.3 ) with pembrolizumab
þ þ
10 mg/kg, versus 6.8 months (range 2.8e11.3) for
chemotherapy. At analysis, eight patients receiving
pembrolizumab had response durations greater than 2
years (Fig. 4).
Of the 540 patients enrolled, 528 received 1 dose of
�
study treatment and were evaluated for safety. Median
time on treatment was 112.5 days (range, 1.0e988.0)
and 145.0 days (range, 1.0e967.0) for patients receiving
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively,
versus 62.0 days (range, 1.0e491.0) for chemotherapy.
Incidence of any-grade treatment-related adverse events
(AEs) was similar among the arms and occurred in 125
(70%) of 178 patients, 136 (76%) of 179 and 138 (81%) of
171 patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg,
10 mg/kg and chemotherapy, respectively. Treatmentrelated grade IIIeIV AEs were highest with chemotherapy (45 [26%] of 171 patients), versus 24 (13%) of
178 patients with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 29 (16%)
of 179 patients with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg (Table 2).
AE profiles of the pembrolizumab doses were similar
and consistent with previous reports [13]. Common
grade IIIeIV treatment-related AEs with incidence 1%
�


were diarrhoea and fatigue in (n Z 4 [1.1%] patients
each); vomiting in (n Z 2 [<1%] patients) for the combined pembrolizumab doses; anaemia (n Z 9 [5.3%]),
fatigue (n Z 8 [4.7%]), leucopenia (n Z 7 [4.1%]), neutropenia (n Z 6 [3.5%]), thrombocytopenia, nausea and
vomiting in (n Z 4 [2.3%] each) and peripheral neuropathy (n Z 2 [1.2%]) for chemotherapy. One
treatment-related death attributed to a general deterioration in physical health precipitated by grade III diarrhoea, and grade III pneumonia occurred in an 85-yearold patient treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg. Permanent treatment discontinuation due to treatmentrelated AEs occurred in eight (4%) patients receiving
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 15 (8%) receiving pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and nine (5%) receiving chemotherapy (Table 2).
AEs of an immune nature, regardless of attribution
to treatment by investigator, occurred in 32 (18%) patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 38 (21%)
treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and three (2%)
patients treated with chemotherapy (Appendix). The
most common immune-mediated AEs were hypothyroidism in 16 (9%) and 15 (8%) patients treated with
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively;
hyperthyroidism in seven (4%) and two (1%),
respectively and pneumonitis in four (2% [one grade III
event]) and five (3% [three grade III events]), respectively. Grade III treatment-related immune-mediated
AEs were 2% and 6% for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and
10 mg/kg, respectively. No patients experienced grade
IV or V events. Immune-mediated AEs were generally
managed by treatment withdrawal, supportive care or
corticosteroid therapy. Discontinuations due to
immune-mediated AEs occurred in 2% and 6% of patients treated with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/
kg, respectively.

4. Discussion

In this final analysis of KEYNOTE-002, with median
follow-up of 28 months, pembrolizumab versus
investigator-choice chemotherapy provided numerical
but not statistically significant, improvement in OS
in patients with heavily pretreated, ipilimumabrefractory, advanced melanoma. With an additional
18 months of follow-up, responses to pembrolizumab
continued to be more durable with increased incidence
of PR and CR. In addition, the PFS benefit of pembrolizumab was confirmed with approximately 20% of
patients alive and progression-free at 24 months. ORR
remained five- to six-fold greater with pembrolizumab
versus chemotherapy [13]. All analyses favoured pembrolizumab over chemotherapy across all subgroups
evaluated, including baseline LDH, tumour size,
M-status and hepatic involvement. There were no significant differences in efficacy between pembrolizumab
doses, consistent with data from KEYNOTE-001 and


KEYNOTE-006 (pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in
advanced, including treatment-naı¨ve melanoma), that
showed no significant difference in outcomes based on
dose density (2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg) and frequency
(Q2W versus Q3W).
At final analysis, improvement in median OS was not
statistically significant with pembrolizumab versus
chemotherapy. This lack of OS benefit is not surprising,
given the demanding statistical crossover design of
KEYNOTE-002 and baseline patient characteristics. At
final analysis, no patients remained on chemotherapy,
and over half (98 of 179 [55%]) of the patients had
crossed over to pembrolizumab; six patients also
received antiePD-1 therapy off-study, for an effective
crossover rate of 58% (104 of 179). These factors may
have contributed to an improvement in OS in the
chemotherapy arm. Adjusting for crossover provided a
numerical, but not statistically significant, benefit in OS
with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy. Moreover,
patients were heavily pretreated, (397 [74%] of 540

refractory disease, which may explain why the OS in
this study was lower than that seen in the KEYNOTE001 study of pembrolizumab in a mixed population of
patients with treatment-naı¨ve and ipilimumabrefractory melanoma [17,18]. In the latter, median OS


was 23 months, with 1- and 2-year OS rates of 66% and
49%, respectively, in the total patient population and
was 31 months with 1- and 2-year OS rates of 73% and

therapy in the first line which is typically greater than

the responses seen in heavily pretreated patient
populations.
Prior treatment with CTLA-4 blockade and chemotherapy may affect the tumour microenvironment and
impair response to antiePD-1 therapy. This is suggested
by the lower ORR to nivolumab in patients with progression following ipilimumab in CheckMate 037 (32%)

[14] compared with ORR in treatment-naı¨ve (40%) patients receiving nivolumab [11]. Similarly, in a pooled
analysis of KEYNOTE-001, ORR was 29% in patients
with ipilimumab-refractory melanoma versus 39% in the
treatment-naı¨ve patients. Differences were seen also in
the 1- and 2-year OS rates between patients who were
ipilimumab refractory (63% and 46%) versus treatment
naı¨ve (71% and 53%). In a longer term follow-up of
CheckMate 037, although ORR (27% versus 10%) and
DOR (31.9 months versus 12.8 months) remained higher
with nivolumab versus chemotherapy, median OS was
not significantly improved (15.7 months versus 14.4
months; HR 0.95), and there was no improvement in
median PFS (3.1 months versus 3.7 months; HR 1.0)

[15]. At the time of initiation of KEYNOTE-002, ipilimumab was among standard-of-care as first-line therapy
for advanced melanoma. As currently the clinical standard is PD-1 inhibitor in the first line, few patients can
be treated in this sequential fashion. However, the current data support the use of pembrolizumab over
chemotherapy for patients who have failed ipilimumab.
For patients not treated with PD-1 inhibitor, these data
indicate benefit of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy
as next-line therapy.
The overall safety of pembrolizumab was tolerable
versus chemotherapy, with manageable immune-related
AEs. The incidence of treatment-related AEs was similar
to that seen at the second interim analysis, with fewer
grade IIIeIV AEs versus chemotherapy, despite an
almost two-fold longer treatment exposure. Rates of
immune-mediated AEs were similar to those reported at
second interim analysis. Most were grade IeII and
manageable with supportive care, immunosuppressive
therapy or treatment discontinuation. No new immune
toxicities were reported.
In summary, these data show that treatment with
pembrolizumab improved OS versus chemotherapy in
patients with heavily pretreated, ipilimumab-refractory
melanoma, but this did not meet statistical significance.
The significant PFS benefit, durable response and lower
rate of high-grade treatment-related AEs support the
benefit of antiePD-1 therapy in this patient population
and pembrolizumab as a standard-of-care for advanced
melanoma.
