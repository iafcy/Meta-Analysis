**BACKGROUND**
The combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib showed antitumor activity in a phase
1b trial involving patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma.
Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib
in such patients was unclear.

**METHODS**
In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously
untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg)
intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients)
or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429
patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in
the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective response rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.

**RESULTS**
After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who
were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 78.3%
in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38
to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for
disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group
and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of
pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal
Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and
poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or
higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.

**CONCLUSIONS**
Among patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment
with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and
progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment
with sunitinib. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme; KEYNOTE-426 ClinicalTrials.gov

enal-cell carcinoma is characterized by susceptibility to both immunotherapeutic and antiangiogenic treatment
approaches and resistance to cytotoxic chemo-R
therapy.[1] Agents such as sunitinib that target the
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway are standard first-line therapy for advanced
disease.[2-7] Despite the approval of several targeted therapies by entities such as the Food and
Drug Administration, the European Medicines
Agency, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical
Devices Agency, the survival rate among patients
with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma has plateaued.[8,9]

Both the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib and the anti–programmed death 1
(PD-1) monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab have
shown antitumor activity in patients with previously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell
carcinoma.[6,10] In a phase 1b trial involving patients with previously untreated metastatic renalcell carcinoma, 73% (95% confidence interval

[CI], 59 to 84) of the patients who received
pembrolizumab plus axitinib had a response;
65% of patients had at least one treatment-related
adverse event.[11] We conducted the KEYNOTE-426
trial to determine whether pembrolizumab plus
axitinib would result in better outcomes than
sunitinib in patients with previously untreated
advanced renal-cell carcinoma.


Methods


**Patients**
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older;
had newly diagnosed or recurrent stage IV (according to the American Joint Commission on
Cancer, seventh edition, classification) clear-cell
renal-cell carcinoma; had received no previous
systemic therapy for advanced disease; had a
Karnofsky performance-status score of 70 or
more (on a scale from 0 to 100, with lower
scores indicating greater disability)[12]; had at
least one measurable lesion as evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1[13]; and had an available tumor sample for biomarker assessment.
Patients were excluded if they had symptomatic
central nervous system metastases, active autoimmune disease, or poorly controlled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥150 mm Hg or
diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg), if they


had had an ischemic cardiovascular event or
New York Heart Association class III or IV congestive heart failure within 1 year before screening, or if they were receiving systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Full eligibility criteria are
listed in section 5.1 in the trial protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

**Trial Design and Treatments**
In this open-label, phase 3 trial, patients were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pembrolizumab (Keytruda, Merck Sharp & Dohme)
plus axitinib (Inlyta, Pfizer) or sunitinib (Sutent,
Pfizer). Randomization was stratified according
to International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group (favorable, intermediate, or poor risk) and geographic
region (North America, Western Europe, or the
rest of the world). Favorable risk corresponds to
an IMDC score of 0, intermediate risk to a score
of 1 or 2, and poor risk to a score of 3 to 6.[14]
IMDC risk score is determined by the total number of the following six risk factors that are
present: Karnofsky performance-status score of
less than 80, time from initial diagnosis to randomization of less than 1 year, hemoglobin level
below the lower limit of the normal range, corrected serum calcium level above the upper
limit of the normal range, absolute neutrophil
count above the upper limit of the normal range,
and platelet count above the upper limit of the
normal range.[14]

Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg once every 3 weeks. Axiti­
nib was administered orally at a dose of 5 mg
twice daily; the dose could be increased to 7 mg,
then 10 mg, twice daily if safety criteria were
met and reduced to 3 mg, then 2 mg, twice
daily to manage toxic effects. Sunitinib was administered orally at a dose of 50 mg daily for the
first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle; the dose
could be reduced to 37.5 mg, then 25 mg, for the
first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle to manage
toxic effects. Treatment was continued until disease progression, development of unacceptable
toxic effects, or physician or patient decision to
discontinue. Pembrolizumab was administered
for a maximum of 35 cycles. Patients who had a
confirmed complete response could discontinue
treatment. Patients with unconfirmed disease
progression who were in clinically stable condition could continue to receive treatment at the


2 n engl j med nejm org


-----

discretion of the investigator until progression
was confirmed by means of subsequent imaging
performed at least 28 days after radiographic
progression was first observed; patients could be
treated beyond confirmed progression if prespecified criteria were met. If one drug in the
pembrolizumab–axitinib group was discontinued
because of toxic effects, the other drug could be
continued. Full guidelines regarding treatment
decisions and management of adverse events are
provided in section 5.2 in the protocol.

**End Points and Assessments**
The dual primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival according to
RECIST, version 1.1, as determined by blinded,
independent central review. The key secondary
end point was the objective response rate according to RECIST, version 1.1, as determined by
blinded, independent central review. Other secondary end points included duration of response
and safety. Efficacy was assessed in the intentionto-treat population, which included all patients
who underwent randomization. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, which includ­
ed all randomly assigned patients who received
one or more doses of trial treatment.
Data on adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were collected regularly throughout the
treatment period and for 30 days thereafter (data
on serious adverse events and events of interest
were collected for 90 days after the end of the
treatment period) and were graded according to
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Tumor imaging was performed at baseline and
week 12 and then every 6 weeks through week
54 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Bone scans
were required at baseline. If the baseline bone
scan was positive, additional scans were performed at week 18 and then every 12 weeks
through week 54 and every 24 weeks thereafter.
Response was assessed according to RECIST,
version 1.1.[13] Patients were contacted for assessment of survival every 12 weeks during follow-up.
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
in archival or newly obtained, formalin-fixed tumor samples was assessed at a central laboratory
with the use of the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx
assay (Agilent Technologies) and was characterized according to the combined positive score,
which was calculated as the number of PD-L1–


positive cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, and
macrophages) divided by the total number of
tumor cells, multiplied by 100.

**Trial Oversight**
The trial was designed by academic advisors and
employees of the sponsor. An independent data
and safety monitoring committee oversaw the
trial, periodically assessed safety, and assessed
efficacy at the prespecified interim analysis. The
trial protocol and all amendments were approved
by the appropriate ethics body at each center. All
patients provided written informed consent before enrollment.
The trial was conducted in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the authors
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the
data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol and attest that they had access to the data
and that they participated in writing or reviewing and editing drafts of the manuscript. As part
of the site agreement, investigators agreed to
keep all aspects of the trial, including the data,
confidential. Assistance with the preparation of
the manuscript was provided by a medical writer
employed by the sponsor.

**Statistical Analysis**
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate
overall survival, progression-free survival, and
duration of response. The stratified log-rank test
was used to assess between-group differences in
overall survival and progression-free survival. A
stratified Cox proportional-hazards model and
Efron’s method of handling ties were used to
assess the magnitude of the treatment difference. The stratified method of Miettinen and
Nurminen with weights proportional to the
stratum size was used to assess the difference
in response rate. The stratification factors used
at randomization were applied to all stratified
analyses.
The full statistical analysis plan is available in
section 8.0 in the protocol. The graphical method of Maurer and Bretz was used to control the
family-wise type I error rate at a one-sided alpha
level of 0.025 across all hypotheses and interim
analyses. We estimated that with enrollment of
861 patients, the trial would have 99% power to
detect a hazard ratio for disease progression or
death of 0.60 for the comparison of pembroliz­
umab plus axitinib with sunitinib, at a one-sided


n engl j med nejm org 3

alpha level of 0.002, assuming 487 instances of
disease progression or death and one interim
analysis (performed after approximately 75% of
the target number of events had occurred) and
80% power to detect a hazard ratio for death of
0.75, at a one-sided alpha level of 0.023, assuming 404 deaths and two interim analyses (performed after approximately 48% of the target
number of deaths had occurred for the first interim analysis and 74% of the target number of
deaths had occurred for the second interim
analysis). The first interim analysis was to be
performed at least 7 months after the last patient underwent randomization and after at least
305 instances of disease progression or death
had been observed; it was estimated that approximately 195 deaths would be observed at
this time. At the cutoff date for the first interim
analysis (August 24, 2018), a total of 395 patients
had disease progression or had died, and 156
deaths had occurred; the one-sided P value
thresholds for declaring the superiority of pembrolizumab plus axitinib over sunitinib were
0.0001 for overall survival and 0.0013 for progression-free survival; if the overall and progression-free survival thresholds were met, response
rate could be tested at a one-sided alpha level of
0.025. All data reported here are based on the
first interim analysis.


Results


**Patients and Treatments**
A total of 1062 patients at 129 sites in 16 countries were screened for eligibility; of these, 861
patients at 124 sites underwent randomization
from October 24, 2016, to January 24, 2018. A
total of 432 patients were assigned to the pembrolizumab–axitinib group, and 429 patients
were assigned to the sunitinib group (Fig. S1 in
the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM
.org). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were as expected for a trial involving
patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma and
were balanced between the groups (Table 1). The
IMDC risk category was favorable for 31.2% of
patients, intermediate for 56.2%, and poor for
12.5%. Among the 822 patients with tumor
samples that could be evaluated for PD-L1 expression, 60.5% had a combined positive score
of 1 or more.
A total of 429 patients in the pembrolizumab–


axitinib group and 425 patients in the sunitinib
group received at least one dose of the assigned
treatment. The median duration of any treatment
was 10.4 months (range, 0.03 to 21.2) in the
pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 7.8 months
(range, 0.07 to 20.5) in the sunitinib group. In
the pembrolizumab–axitinib group, the median
duration of treatment was 8.3 months with pembrolizumab and axitinib, 9.2 months with pembrolizumab, and 9.6 months with axitinib. The
median daily dose of axitinib was 9.8 mg, and
the median daily dose of sunitinib was 50.0 mg.
Median follow-up (defined as the time from
randomization to death or the date of data cutoff for those who were alive) was 12.8 months
(range, 0.1 to 22.0) in the intention-to-treat
population. In the as-treated population, 253 of
the 429 patients (59.0%) in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group and 183 of the 425 patients
(43.1%) in the sunitinib group were still receiving the trial treatment. The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was disease
progression (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the pembrolizumab–axitinib group,
88 patients (50.0% of the 176 patients who discontinued pembrolizumab plus axitinib) received
subsequent anticancer therapy, most commonly
a VEGF or VEGF receptor inhibitor (44.3%). In
the sunitinib group, 147 patients (60.7% of the
242 patients who discontinued sunitinib) received
subsequent anticancer therapy, most commonly
a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor (37.6%) (Table S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix).

**Efficacy**
The estimated percentage of patients who were
alive at 12 months was 89.9% (95% CI, 86.4 to
92.4) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and
78.3% (95% CI, 73.8 to 82.1) in the sunitinib
group. The corresponding estimates for 18 months
were 82.3% (95% CI, 77.2 to 86.3) and 72.1%
(95% CI, 66.3 to 77.0) (Fig. 1A). The median
survival was not reached in either group. The
risk of death was 47% lower in the pembroliz­
umab–axitinib group than in the sunitinib group
(hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to
0.74; P<0.0001). The median progression-free
survival was 15.1 months (95% CI, 12.6 to 17.7)
in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 11.1
months (95% CI, 8.7 to 12.5) in the sunitinib
group (Fig. 2A). The hazard ratio for disease progression or death was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84;

(range, 1.4+ to 18.2+ months), and the median
duration of response was 15.2 months (range,
1.1+ to 15.4+) in the sunitinib group (with plus
signs in the ranges indicating an ongoing response at the time of data cutoff). The estimated
percentage of patients with an ongoing response
at 1 year was 70.6% in the pembrolizumab–­
axitinib group and 61.6% in the sunitinib group
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

**Safety**
Adverse events of any cause occurred in 98.4% of
the 429 patients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib
group who received the assigned treatment and
in 99.5% of the 425 patients in the sunitinib group
who received the assigned treatment. These events
were of grade 3 or higher in 75.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and
in 70.6% of the patients in the sunitinib group;
62.9% of the patients in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group and 58.1% of the patients in the
sunitinib group had events of grade 3 or higher
that were attributed by the investigator to trial
treatment. In the pembrolizumab–axitinib group,
adverse events of any cause led to discontinuation of either drug in 30.5% of patients, discontinuation of both drugs in 10.7%, interruption
of either drug in 69.9%, and dose reduction of
axitinib in 20.3%. The median time to discontinuation of both pembrolizumab and axitinib because
of adverse events of any cause was 105.5 days, and
the median time to discontinuation of pembrolizumab because of adverse events of any cause


was 65 days. In the sunitinib group, adverse events
of any cause led to discontinuation in 13.9% of
patients, interruption in 49.9%, and dose reduction in 30.1%. A summary of treatment-related
adverse events is provided in Table S3 in the
Supplementary Appendix. Of the 11 patients
(2.6%) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group
who died from adverse events, 4 (0.9%) died
from treatment-related adverse events (from myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis,
and pneumonitis, in 1 patient each). Among the
15 patients (3.5%) in the sunitinib group who
died from adverse events, 7 patients (1.6%) died
from treatment-related adverse events (from acute
myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, fulminant
hepatitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intracranial hemorrhage, malignant neoplasm progression, and pneumonia, in 1 patient each).
In both groups, the most common adverse
events of any cause and the most common adverse events related to treatment were diarrhea
and hypertension (Table 3, and Table S3 in the
Supplementary Appendix). The between-group
difference in the risk of adverse events of grade 3
or higher that occurred in at least 10% of patients is provided in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher
that occurred in 10% or more of patients were
hypertension and increased alanine aminotransferase levels in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group
and hypertension in the sunitinib group.
Adverse events of interest, which were determined on the basis of a list of terms specified by
the sponsor and were considered regardless of
whether the investigator determined that they
were related to treatment, occurred in 51.3% of
patients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group
and in 36.2% of patients in the sunitinib group
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Grade 3 events occurred in 8.4% of patients in
the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and in 1.6%
in the sunitinib group, grade 4 events occurred
in 1.6% and 0%, respectively, and grade 5 events
occurred in 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively.


The results of this randomized, phase 3 trial of
patients with previously untreated advanced renalcell carcinoma showed that treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in a 47% lower
risk of death and a 31% lower risk of disease

progression or death than treatment with sunitinib. The objective response rate was 23.6 percentage points higher in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group than in the sunitinib group.


Although subgroup analyses should be considered hypothesis-generating only, it is notable
that the benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib
was observed across all subgroups tested, including in all IMDC risk groups and both in patients
who had tumors with PD-L1 expression and
those who had tumors without PD-L1 expression.
These data build on the single-agent activity of
pembrolizumab and axitinib.[6,10] The significant
overall survival advantage is particularly notable
because it has not been achieved with first-line
treatment of renal-cell carcinoma with the use of
anti–VEGF-based therapy administered alone or
in combination.[2-7,15]

Results of other trials have also suggested
that combination therapy with a checkpointinhibitor backbone has anticancer activity as firstline therapy in patients with advanced renal-cell
carcinoma. Among patients who had intermediate or poor risk according to the IMDC criteria,

a combination of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab
and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab resulted in longer
overall survival and a higher objective response
rate (the primary end points) than sunitinib;
nivolumab plus ipilimumab also resulted in a
complete response in 9% of patients.[16] An exploratory analysis involving patients with favorable risk showed that sunitinib resulted in longer
progression-free survival and a higher objective
response rate than nivolumab plus ipilimumab.
The combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab
and axitinib resulted in longer progression-free
survival and a higher objective response rate than
sunitinib among patients with previously untreated PD-L1–positive disease.[17] Additional follow-up
is required to determine whether avelumab plus
axitinib will improve overall survival. The combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab
with the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevaciz­
umab resulted in longer progression-free survival
and fewer grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse
events than sunitinib among patients with previously untreated PD-L1–positive disease.[18]

The observed safety profiles of pembrolizu­
mab plus axitinib and of sunitinib were as expected on the basis of the known profiles of these
three drugs, although the incidence of grade 3
or 4 elevations in liver-enzyme levels in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group was higher than previously observed when each agent was used as
monotherapy.[19,20] There were no deaths related to
hepatic adverse events in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group. Further characterization of hepatic adverse events in this trial is ongoing. Discontinuation of any treatment because of adverse
events occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group than in the sunitinib
group. The incidence and severity of adverse
events of interest were as expected on the basis
of previous experience with pembrolizumab monotherapy.[10,19] The exception is a greater incidence
of hyperthyroidism and of hypothyroidism, which


was not unexpected given that thyroid abnormalities are also a known side effect of axitinib.[20]

A limitation of our trial was the short duration of follow-up. Because of this, the number
of deaths that accrued in certain subgroups was
small, which led to large confidence intervals
around the point estimates. The short duration of
follow-up may also mean that responses, including complete responses, are still evolving. No
further alpha-controlled efficacy testing will be
performed because the protocol-specified criteria
for declaring a significant benefit of pembrolizu­
mab plus axitinib as compared with sunitinib
were met. However, patients will continue to be
followed for assessment of efficacy and safety.
In conclusion, the results of the KEYNOTE-426
trial showed that among patients with previously
untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted
in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival and a significantly higher
objective response rate than sunitinib alone. The
hepatic toxic effects of pembrolizumab plus
axitinib require further examination, but the
overall frequency of toxic effects was similar in
the two groups. The benefit of pembrolizumab
plus axitinib was observed across all IMDC prognostic risk categories and in both PD-L1 expression subgroups.
