### Summary
**Background Pomalidomide and dexamethasone is a standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma in whom**
**bortezomib and lenalidomide treatment has failed. KEYNOTE-183 assessed efficacy and safety of pomalidomide**
**and dexamethasone with or without pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.**
**Here, we present the findings of an unplanned, ad-hoc interim analysis at the request of the US Food and Drug**
**Administration (FDA).**

**Methods KEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 97 medical centres across 11 countries**
**(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). Patients aged at**
**least 18 years with multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1,**
**previously treated with at least two lines of therapy (excluding pomalidomide) and refractory to the last line were**
**randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group or the pomalidomide**
**and dexamethasone group via an interactive voice response or integrated web response system. Patients received oral**
**pomalidomide 4 mg daily on days 1–21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in 28-day**
**cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The dual primary endpoints were**
**progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was**
**assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,**
**number NCT02576977, and it is closed for accrual.**

**Findings Between Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 249 patients were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab**
**plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). On**
**July 3, 2017, the FDA established that risks associated with the triple combination outweighed benefits and halted the**
**study. Median follow-up was 8·1 months (IQR 4·5–10·9). Median progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI**
**3·7–7·5) in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 8·4 months (5·9–not reached)**
**in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group; progression-free survival estimates at 6 months were 48% (95% CI**
**37–58) versus 60% (49–69) at 6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1·53; 95% CI 1·05–2·22; p=0·98). Median overall survival**
**was not reached (95% CI 12·9–not reached) versus 15·2 months (12·7–not reached; HR 1·61; 95% CI 0·91–2·85;**
**p=0·95); overall survival estimates at 6 months were 82% (95% CI 74–88) versus 90% (82–95). Serious adverse events**
**occurred in 75 (63%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus**
**56 (46%) of 121 patients in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. Four (3%) treatment-related deaths occurred**
**in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (one each of unknown cause, neutropenic**
**sepsis, myocarditis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome); myocarditis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were considered**
**related to pembrolizumab. No treatment-related deaths were reported in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone**
**group.**

**Interpretation The results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit–risk profile**
**of pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with relapsed or refractory**
**multiple myeloma.**

pomalidomide, proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib
and carfilzomib, and effective combination with novel
therapies with different mechanisms of action such as
daratumumab have improved overall survival in multiple
myeloma.[3–9] Most patients still undergo cycles of remission
and relapse until the disease becomes refractory. Prognosis
is poor in patients who are refractory to immunomodulatory
imides or proteasome inhibitors.[10] Effective combination
of novel therapies with different mechanisms of action
remains an unmet need.
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanised mono-​
clonal antibody against PD-1 that blocks interaction between
PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, with antitumour
activity across multiple tumour types.[11–14] In two phase 1
studies, pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combin­
ation with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone had
manageable safety and promising antitumour activity in
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.[15,16] In
a phase 2 study, pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and
dexamethasone led to a response in 60% of patients, a
median response duration of 14·7 months (95% CI 7·9–
17·5), and manageable safety, supporting a randomised trial
of pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with relapsed
or refractory multiple myeloma [17]


**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
We did a PubMed search using the terms “relapsed” and
“multiple myeloma” filtered by article type (clinical trial) and
publication dates (Jan 1, 2013, to Nov 27, 2018) with no
language restrictions, which yielded 70 articles. Treatment of
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma poses the unique
challenge of balancing efficacy and safety in patients who tend
to have had many previous treatments and are older. Therefore,
several ongoing phase 1 and 2 trials are being done to assess
combinations of the following drugs: bendamustine,
tivantinib, bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, delanzomib,
venetoclax, ricolinostat, vorinostat, lenalidomide,
pomalidomide, daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab and
pembrolizumab. The phase 2 ELOQUENT-3 study in patients
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma showed
improved progression-free survival in patients treated with
immunostimulatory antibody against SLAMF7 (elotuzumab)
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone versus pomalidomide
and dexamethasone alone (10·3 months vs 4·7 months; hazard
ratio 0·54; p=0·008). This result led to the recent US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the elotuzumab
combination in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

Narrowing the search by adding filters for the terms “multiple
myeloma” and “PD-1” yielded only two results relevant to
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, both involving a PD-1
inhibitor. One phase 2, single-arm trial reported acceptable
safety (grade 3 or 4 adverse events in 40% of patients) and
promising activity (response in 60% of patients and median


progression-free survival of 17·4 months [95% CI 11·7–18·8])
with the combination of pembrolizumab and pomalidomide
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma. A phase 1b study showed acceptable safety
(drug-related adverse events in 63% of patients) and
antitumour activity (complete response after radiotherapy in
one [4%] of 27 patients) with nivolumab in patients with
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. These results provide
a promising backdrop for the KEYNOTE-183 study.

**Added value of this study**
This phase 3 study was done to assess the efficacy and safety of
the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with pomalidomide
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma. Despite positive results in a previous study,
an interim analysis done at a median follow-up of 8·1 months
(IQR 4·5–10·9) at the request of the US FDA showed an
unfavourable benefit–risk profile for the pembrolizumab plus
pomalidomide and dexamethasone combination in patients
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and
KEYNOTE-183 was halted.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Although the results of KEYNOTE-183 are unlikely to change
clinical practice in light of alternative, efficacious, and safe triplet
and quadruplet treatments in this setting, this study might
provide valuable information to guide the design of future
clinical studies involving checkpoint inhibitors in relapsed or
refractory multiple myeloma.


In the KEYNOTE-183 study, we assessed clinical effects
of combining pembrolizumab with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory
multiple myeloma. We present the results of the
unplanned, interim efficacy (survival outcomes and
tumour response) and safety analyses.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
KEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3
trial of pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and
dexamethasone compared with pomalidomide and
dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or
refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were enrolled at
97 medical centres across 11 countries (Australia,
Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan,
New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). The trial
protocol is available in appendix 2 (pp 1–151). The study
was done in accordance with the protocol and amend-​
ments, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the
Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and subsequent
amendments were approved by the appropriate
institutional review board or ethics committee at each
participating institution


-----

Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; confirmed
diagnosis of active multiple myeloma and measurable
disease; at least two previous lines of anti-myeloma
therapy, including immunomodulatory imides (lenali-​
domide or thalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors
(bortezomib, ixazomib, or carfilzomib); failure of last
line of therapy, defined as refractory (resistant to
treatment or documented progression during or within
60 days of completing immunomodulatory imide or
proteasome inhibitor-based treatment) or relapsed and
refractory (relapse within 6 months of stopping treat­
ment with an immunomodulatory imide or proteasome
inhibitor-containing regimen); Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1;
adequate organ (protocol-defined haema­tological, renal,
hepatic, and coagulation) function; and provision of
bone marrow biopsy sample or aspirate material for
disease assessment and biomarker analysis. Patients
were ineligible if they had non-secretory or oligosecretory
myeloma; smouldering multiple myeloma; monoclonal
gammopathy of unknown significance; plasma cell
leukaemia; Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia; hyper­
sensitivity to thalidomide, lenalidomide, or dexa­metha­
sone; previous therapy with pomalidomide; active
autoimmune disease necessitating systemic treatment
in the past 2 years; evidence of active, non-infectious
pneumonitis; active infection requiring intravenous
systemic therapy; known psychiatric or substance abuse
disorders that would interfere with compliance with
trial requirements; history of repeated infections,
primary amyloidosis, hyperviscosity, or POEMS syn­
drome; history of immune suppression or is receiving
systemic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy within
7 days of first dose of study drug; previous monoclonal
antibody within 4 weeks of study or ongoing adverse
events due to drugs administered more than 4 weeks
earlier; previous antimyeloma therapy within 2 weeks of
study; previous allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell
transplantation (SCT) in 5 years before the study;
autologous SCT in the 12 weeks before the study;
plasmapheresis in the 4 weeks before the study; inability
to undergo thrombo­embolic prophylaxis; peripheral
neuropathy grade 2 or worse; another malignancy in the
5 years before the study; previous therapy with an antiPD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 antibody;
HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection; received live
vaccine in 30 days before first dose of study drug; or if
they had an immediate relative who is investigational
site or funder staff involved in this trial. All patients
provided written informed consent to participate.

#### Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembro-​
lizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group
or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group using
an interactive voice response system or integrated web


response system (randomised allocation schedules were
generated by the funder and provided to site staff as
required via an automated telephone system). Rando-​
misation was stratified by number of previous lines of
therapy (two vs ≥three) and disease status (lenalidomide
refractory _vs sensitive). This was an open-label study;_
therefore, masking was not performed.

#### Procedures
Patients received oral pomalidomide 4 mg daily on
days 1–21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg
for patients aged >75 years) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in
28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab
200 mg every 3 weeks. Dose interruptions were permitted
in cases of medical or surgical events or for logistical
reasons unrelated to study therapy; patients continued
with study therapy within 28 days of the scheduled
interruption. Dose modification occurred per prespecified
protocol guidance for each of the treatment drugs in
response to toxicity (details in the redacted protocol).
Treatment was continued until confirmed progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or physician or patient decision to
withdraw.
Disease response was assessed every 4 weeks; patients
were considered non-evaluable if they had received at
least one dose of study treatment but had not had posttreatment assessment or if they had been assigned to a
group but had not received study treatment. Patients who
discontinued for reasons other than progression had
post-treatment follow-up visits for disease status every
4 weeks until progression, initiation of non-study cancer
treatment, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up.
Patients were contacted for assessment of survival status
every 12 weeks after the end of treatment.
Adverse events were graded per Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and monitored
throughout treatment and for 30 days (90 days for serious
adverse events) after treatment end. Immune-mediated
adverse events were defined as adverse events—specified
by the sponsor (non-serious and serious) and included
by the investigator—associated with pembrolizumab
exposure that were consistent with immune phenomena
and had a potentially immunological cause regardless of
attribution to study treatment or immune relatedness.
Attribution of adverse events to the study drugs was
determined by site investigators.
Patients could withdraw consent at any time for any
reason or be excluded from the trial at the investigator’s
discretion in the event of untoward effects. Patients could
also have been withdrawn for the following reasons:
documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse
events, intercurrent illness preventing further study
treatment, confirmed pregnancy, receipt of non-protocolspecified anti-myeloma therapy before documented
disease progression, non-adherence to trial treatment or
procedures, loss to follow-up, and administrative reasons.
The trial was to be terminated prematurely if quality or

adherence to the protocol and regulatory requirements
were poor, plans were made to modify or discontinue
development of pembrolizumab, or in response to a
request by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
or other health authority because of safety concerns.

#### Outcomes
The dual primary endpoints were progression-free
survival, defined as time from randomisation to first
documented disease progression or death from any
cause per International Myeloma Working Group 2011
criteria[18] by masked independent central review, and
overall survival, defined as time from randomisation to
death from any cause. Secondary efficacy endpoints were
overall response, duration of response, disease control,
safety and tolerability of both treatments, and secondary
progression-free survival (time from randomisation to
subsequent disease progression after initiation of new
anticancer therapy or death from any cause, whichever
occurs first, based on investigator assessment; not
reported here). Overall response was the proportion of
patients who achieved at least a partial response, assessed
by masked central review.[19,20] Duration of response was
defined as the time from first documented partial
response until progression or death, assessed by masked
central review. Disease control was the proportion of
patients with confirmed complete response, very good
partial response, partial response, minimal response, or
stable disease for at least 12 weeks before confirmed
progression. The International Response Criteria for
multiple myeloma[19] were used to define complete, very
good partial, and partial responses, and stable and
progressive disease. Full description of these criteria is in
appendix 1 (p 4). Median time to progression, defined as
time from randomisation to first documented
progression, was also assessed.

#### Statistical analysis
Hypothesis testing of objective response rate, progressionfree survival, and overall survival was controlled by a
family-wise type I error rate of 2·5% (one-sided α).[21] A
sample size of 300 patients was planned. For progressionfree survival, based on 236 events (estimated to occur
about 20 months after the first patient enrolled), the study
had 90·6% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·635
with pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexametha­
sone versus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (assuming
median progression-free survival of 4·0 months) at a
one-sided α of 1·5%. For overall survival, based on
182 events (estimated to occur 10 months after progressionfree survival analysis), the study had 80·5% power to
detect a HR of 0·6 for pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide
and dexamethasone versus poma​lidomide and
dexamethasone (assuming a median overall survival of
12·7 months) at a one-sided α of 0·5%. For overall
response based on the first 210 randomly assigned


patients, the study had 88·7% power to show
a 25% difference between the groups (55% for pem­
brolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone _vs_
30% pomalidomide and dexamethasone) at a one-sided α
of 0·5%.
Progression-free survival was compared between
treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test with a
stratified Cox regression providing the HR. Proportions
of progression events were estimated within treatment
groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Duration of
response was assessed descriptively using Kaplan-Meier
statistics. Safety was analysed using descriptive statistics
overall and a tiered approach. There were no tier 1 events
(subject to inferential testing for statistical significance
between groups); tier 2 events, which must occur in at
least four patients in any treatment group, were assessed
using point estimates with 95% CIs for between-group
comparisons; tier 3 events (adverse events that are
neither tier 1 nor tier 2) were analysed using point
estimates only. Immune-mediated adverse events were
summarised separately by toxicity and grade (including
counts, percentages, and 95% CIs). Two interim analyses
were protocol-specified before final analysis: a final
analysis of objective response and a final progressionfree survival analysis and interim overall survival analysis
(appendix 2 p 104). Statistical analyses were done using
SAS software, version 9.4.
Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population
of all patients assigned to a treatment group. Safety was
assessed in patients who received at least one dose of
study treatment (safety population). An external data
monitoring committee assessed safety and efficacy at
interim timepoints and made recommendations
regarding patient safety and study integrity. This trial is
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02576977.

#### Role of the funding source
The funder of the study was involved in study design,
data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the
report, but not data collection. All authors had full access
to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for
the decision to submit for publication.

### Results
Between Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 348 patients were
screened, of whom 97 were not eligible and two were not
assigned to a group before the study was halted, and
249 were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or
the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). Of
these, 120 patients in the pembrolizumab plus
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group and 121 in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group were treated
(figure 1). Dexamethasone 20 mg was given from the start
of treatment in 81 patients (37 in the pembrolizumab plus
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group and 44 in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group) A list of key

changes made to the protocol after the start of the study is
in appendix 1 (p 3). On July 3, 2017, the FDA halted
KEYNOTE-183 on the basis of interim data presented to
the data monitoring committee, which indicated that the
risks associated with the pembrolizumab combination
outweighed the benefits.[22] Pembrolizumab was
immediately discontinued after the FDA decision to halt
the trial and patients were transferred to available
standard-of-care therapies at their physician’s discretion
and according to local institutional regulations. Patientreported outcomes, pharmacokinetic endpoints, and
exploratory biomarker endpoints were not analysed and
the two preplanned interim analyses were not done
because of early trial termination.
Baseline patient and disease characteristics were
generally similar between groups (table 1). More patients
in the pembrolizumab group had high-risk cytogenetics
than in the pomalidomide and dexa-​methasone group
(28 [22%] of 125 in the pembrolizumab group vs 17 [14%]
of 124 in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group),
including del17p13 (15 [12%] of 125 vs six [5%] of 124) and
plasmacytoma (15 (12%) of 125 [six extramedullary] _vs_
six [5%] of 124 [three extramedullary]; table 1). At the time
of the unplanned interim analysis, median follow-up was
8·1 months (IQR 4·5–10·9) across both groups and
7·8 months (IQR 4·0–10·5) in the pembrolizumab group
versus 8·6 months (IQR 5·1–11·1) in the pomalidomide
and dexa​methasone group (appendix 1 p 5). At data
cutoff, 40 (33%) of the 120 patients who started treatment
in the pembrolizumab group versus 53 (44%) of the
121 who started treatment in the pomalidomide and
dexamethasone group were still on study treatment;
80 (67%) patients versus 68 (56%) had discontinued
(figure 1). Disease progression was the most common
reason for study discontinuation in both treatment
groups (46 [38%] patients in the pembrolizumab group vs
41 [34%] patients in the pomalidomide and
dexamethasone group), followed by adverse events
(22 [18%] _vs nine [7%]). 18 (15%) patients in the_
pembrolizumab group and five (4%) in the pomalidomide
and dexamethasone group discontinued because of
treatment-related adverse events.
Because of premature study termination, progressionfree survival and response endpoints were assessed by
substantiated investigator assessment. At database cutoff
(June 2, 2017), median progression-free survival was
5·6 months (95% CI 3·7–7·5) in the pembrolizumab
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus
8·4 months (5·9–not reached) in the pomalidomide and
dexamethasone group; with an HR for disease
progression or death of 1·53 (95% CI 1·05–2·22; p=0·98;
figure 2A). The number of progression-free survival
events was 115 (65 [52%] patients in the pembrolizumab
group and 50 [40%] in the pomalidomide and dexa-​
methasone group). Median time to progression was
8·1 months (95% CI 5·6–not reached) in the
pembrolizumab group versus 8·7 months (6·6–not

reached) in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group. Estimated progression-free survival was 48%
(95% CI 37–58) versus 60% (49–69) at 6 months and
68% (58–76) versus 79% (70–85) at 3 months (figure 2A).
Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI
12·9–not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus
15·2 months (12·7–not reached) in the pomalidomide
and dexamethasone group; the HR for death was 1·61
(95% CI 0·91–2·85; p=0·95). Estimated overall survival
was 82% (95% CI 74–88) versus 90% (82–95) at 6 months
and 90% (83–95) versus 98% (93–100) at 3 months
(figure 2B). The HR for comparison of overall survival
was similar among subgroups, except for ECOG
performance status 0, disease stages 1 and 2, and patients
from Japan (appendix 1 p 19). The HR for comparison of
progression-free survival was similar among subgroups,
except for the race (other) and Japan subgroups
(appendix 1 p 20)


-----

43 (34%; 95% CI 26·1–43·4) of 125 patients in the
pembrolizumab group achieved an overall response
(partial response or better) compared with 50 (40%;
31·6–49·5) of 124 in the pomalidomide and dexa-​
methasone group (appendix 1 p 6). Disease control was
achieved by 106 (85%; 77·3–90·6) patients in the
pembrolizumab group and 105 (85%; 77·1–90·5) in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. Median
duration of response was 8·2 months (95% CI 5·2–not
reached) in the pembrolizumab group and was not
reached in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group
(appendix 1 p 5).
Median duration of study treatment was 123·5 days
(IQR 57·5–225·0) in the pembrolizumab group and
127·0 days (78·0–253·0) in the pomalidomide and
dexamethasone group (appendix 1 p 6); at analysis,
patients had received a median of 4·4 cycles (2·0–9·0) of
treatment.
Adverse events of any grade were reported in 119 (99%)
of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab group versus
116 (96%) of 121 in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group; grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in
90 (75%) of 120 versus 77 (64%) of 121 patients; and
serious adverse events were reported in 75 (63%) of 120
versus 56 (46%) of 121 patients (appendix 1 p 7). Grade 5
adverse events occurred in 13 (11%) patients in the
pembrolizumab group versus three (2%) in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (table 2). Anygrade adverse events with an at least 5% difference in
incidence between groups were neutropenia, anaemia,
fatigue, pneumonia, nausea, headache, back pain, and
increase in alanine aminotransferase (table 2). Grade 3 or
4 adverse events with an at least 5% difference between
groups were neutropenia (41 [34%] of 120 vs 26 [21%] of
121) and thrombocytopenia (14 [12%] of 120 vs eight [7%]
of 121). No serious adverse events occurred with at least a
5% difference between groups; serious adverse events
with at least 3% difference between groups are in
appendix 1 (p 7). Data regarding timing of onset of
adverse events are not available. Immune-mediated
adverse events (most commonly pneumonitis,
hyperthyroidism, and rash in 3% of patients each)
occurred in 21 (18%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab
group (table 3). The minimum median time to onset of
any immune-mediated adverse event in patients who
received pembrolizumab was 10 days (severe skin
reaction), with an IQR of 14–65 across all immunemediated adverse events. Only one patient had immunemediated neutropenia, and there were no cases of
immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.
Adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in
24 (20%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab group
versus ten (8%) of 121 patients in the pomalidomide and
dexamethasone group. The most common (occurring in
at least two patients in either group) were death (three [3%]
_vs 0), pneumonia (two [2%]_ _vs one [1%]), neutropenic_
sepsis (two [2%] vs 0) cerebrovascular accident (two [2%]

_vs one [1%]), and dyspnoea (two [2%]_ _vs 0). Of these,_
the cases of neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, and
cerebrovascular accident were considered by the
investigator to be related to treatment. Treatment-related
adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in
18 (15%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and
five (4%) patients in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group; adverse events resulting in treatment interruption
occurred in 72 (60%) and 60 (50%) patients.
As of June 2, 2017, 50 patients had died: 29 (23%) of
125 in the pembrolizumab group (16 from progressive
disease and 13 from adverse events) versus 21 (17%) of
124 in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group
(18 from progressive disease and three from adverse
events). Four (3%) of 120 patients died as a result of
treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab
group (one each of unknown cause, neutropenic sepsis,
myocarditis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome; table 4).
Deaths from myocarditis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome
were attributed to pembrolizumab by the investigator.
Three non-treatment-related deaths occurred in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (one each of
unknown cause, anaemia, and pneumonia; table 4). A
review of disease characteristics among patients who died
showed that more patients in the pembrolizumab group
than the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group had
International Staging System stage III disease (15 [52%] of
29 in the pembrolizumab group vs four [19%] of 21 in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group), high-risk
cytogenetics (ten [34%] _vs six [29%]), plasmacytoma_
(seven [24%] _vs three [14%]), and ECOG performance_
status of 1 (21 [72%] _vs 13 [62%]) at baseline (appendix 1_
p 8). The HR for death was 1·23 (95% CI 0·57–2·66;
p=0·69) when patients with these high-risk disease
characteristics were excluded (appendix 1 p 21). After
exclusion of patients with high-risk characteristics, of the
13 deaths in the pembrolizumab group, four were from
progression and nine were from adverse events (one each
of myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, pericardial
haemorrhage, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome, three
sepsis, and two unknown cause); two of these adverse
events (Stevens–Johnson syndrome and unknown cause)
were considered by the investigator to be related to
pembrolizumab. Of the 13 deaths in the pomalidomide
and dexamethasone group after exclusion of patients with
high-risk characteristics, 12 were from progression and
one was from an adverse event (unknown death).
After study termination, a post-hoc analysis was done
to identify potential factors associated with the imbalance
in the number of deaths between the two treatment
groups. Factors associated with being prognostic or
predictive of death were first assessed by retrospective
random forest analysis. A multivariable Cox regression
analysis was subsequently done to calculate differences
between groups with factors associated with risk for
death identified from the random forest analysis. Age,
ECOG performance status disease stage presence of


**_Figure 2: Progression-free survival by investigator assessment (A) and overall survival (B), in the intention-_**
**to-treat population**

plasmacytoma, and double-refractory status were more
relevant contributors to death than treatment (appendix 1
p 22). Multivariable analysis showed that age, ECOG
performance status, and plasmacytoma significantly
contributed to the risk for death. ECOG performance
status was both prognostic and predictive of outcome. An
ECOG performance status of 0 was associated with
reduced risk for death (HR 0·86; 95% Wald confidence
limits 0·32–2·29), whereas ECOG performance status 1
was associated with increased risk for death (HR 2·3;
95% Wald confidence limits 1·11–4·76). The clinical
course of patients who died from adverse events in the
pembrolizumab group is summarised in appendix 1
(pp 9–18).

### Discussion
In this non-protocol-specified interim analysis of
KEYNOTE-183, after a median follow-up of 8·1 months
(IQR 4·5–10·9) an increased risk for death was observed


-----

with pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexa­
methasone versus poma​lidomide and dexamethasone
alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
myeloma. The early mortality signal led to a halt of
enrolment by the data monitoring committee and to
subsequent study termination by the FDA on July 3, 2017.[22]
Early study termination resulted in incomplete data
collection; at analysis, only 50 (27%) of the 182 protocolspecified events required for analysis of overall survival
and 115 (49%) of the 236 required for analysis of
progression-free survival had occurred. Treatment
exposure was also shortened, with a median of
4·5 treatment cycles (IQR 2·0–8·0) in the pembrolizumab
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (37 [31%]
of 120 patients had fewer than three cycles) compared
with a median of 5·0 treatment cycles (3·0–9·0) in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (29 [24%] of
121 had fewer than three cycles). Longer follow-up
is necessary to discern efficacy outcomes with
immunotherapies given the non-proportional hazards
effect that leads to delayed clinical response and late
separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves.[23–25] As such,
although the overlapping CIs for progression-free survival
and overall response in this premature analysis suggest


-----

no difference between the two treatment groups, this
interpretation is limited by the early study termination.
The acknowledged association between severity of
disease and degree of immune system dysfunction[26,27]
suggests that PD-1 blockade is safer and more effective in
patients with lower burden of disease and less-impaired
immune systems. Therefore, the failure of pembro-​
lizumab to improve the outcomes in patients with
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in our study
population might be attributable to the considerable
immunodeficiency that exists in these patients.[28]

The incidence of any-grade adverse events was similar
between groups, although grade 3 or 4 and serious adverse
events occurred more frequently with pembrolizumab
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone than with
pomalidomide and dexamethasone. All common, nonsevere adverse events were manageable and no specific
type led to treatment discontinuation. The most common
immune-mediated adverse events were pneumonitis,
hyperthyroidism, and rash (each in 3% of patients) in the
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group. Two grade 5 immune-mediated adverse events of
myo­carditis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome occurred,
events expected per the label for pembrolizumab that
were attributed to this drug.[29] Overall, the type and
incidence of immune-mediated adverse events in the
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group were consistent with those reported previously for
pembrolizumab[11–14] and those observed in KEYNOTE-185.[30]

More deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group than in the
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. However, the
numbers of patients who discontinued or died from
disease progression were similar between groups,
suggesting that the risk for progression was similar,
implying that progression-free survival in the
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group could have been influenced by the imbalance in the
number of deaths, two of which were pembrolizumab
related. Similarly, in the KEYNOTE-185 study[30] of patients
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, more deaths
occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group (19 [13%] of 149) than in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (nine [6%]
of 145).
The frequency of high-risk features at baseline among
patients who died prematurely was higher in the
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group than in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group, despite the safeguard of randomisation. Disease
characteristics were generally not balanced between the
treatment groups in this study, probably because patient
enrolment was still ongoing at the time of early study
termination and the unplanned ad-hoc nature of the
analysis. Specifically, among the patients who died early
during the study, a greater proportion of those in the
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone


group than in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone
group had stage III disease, high-risk cytogenetics, or
extramedullary plasmacytoma (three [43%] of seven _vs_
one [33%] of three), factors typically associated with poorer
prognosis; this imbalance might account for the difference
in early death that led to early termination of KEYNOTE-183.
Moreover, when adverse-event-related death was assessed
between the two treatment groups, after removal of
patients with these high-risk characteristics, there was no
significant difference in numbers of deaths between
groups. A multivariable analysis to identify factors
associated with risk for death indicated that only ECOG
performance status 1 was both predictive and prognostic of
risk for death. This might indicate that the performance
status assessment of patients at study entry was under­
estimated, considering patients with ECOG performance
status of 2 are usually included in multiple myeloma
clinical studies but were not (per exclusion criteria) in this
study. Together, these analyses suggest that the imbalance
in the number of deaths is not only related to treatment
(two deaths were pembrolizumab related) but also to nontreatment-related adverse events.
This study was limited by the ad-hoc unplanned nature
of the analysis. The trial was terminated during the
enrolment period. Early termination also probably
affected results of this unplanned analysis because of the
absence of longer-term follow-up efficacy data. The
findings of this study are not generalisable to other
indications; it is not possible to establish whether the
problems encountered in the patients who received
pembrolizumab in combination with standard-of-care
therapy would be observed in other indications.
Our findings are disappointing given the positive
outcomes reported in the previous phase 2 study of

pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone
in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
myeloma.[17] In the previous trial, the combination was
well tolerated and showed encouraging antimyeloma
activity, with a response achieved by 29 (60%) of 48
patients and median progression-free survival of
17·4 months (95% CI 11·7–18·8);[17] median follow-up was
longer than in our study.
Although these data showed an imbalance in the
number of deaths between treatment groups, the interim
analyses were underpowered and inconclusive because
of the shortened follow-up at termination. Additional
studies are necessary to optimise identification of
patients who would benefit from PD-1 inhibition in
combination with pomalidomide. Furthermore, given
the effectiveness of pembrolizumab combinations in the
treatment of other diseases, checkpoint inhibitors should
be appropriately investigated with other treatment
backbones.
