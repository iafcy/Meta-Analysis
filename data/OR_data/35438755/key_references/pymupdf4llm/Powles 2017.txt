### Summary
**Background** **Few options exist for patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after progression**
**with platinum-based chemotherapy. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab (anti-programmed**
**death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) versus chemotherapy in this patient population.**

**Methods We conducted this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial (IMvigor211) at 217 academic**
**medical centres and community oncology practices mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.**
**Patients (aged ≥18 years) with metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy**
**were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice and web response system with a permuted block design (block**
**size of four), to receive atezolizumab 1200 mg or chemotherapy (physician’s choice: vinflunine 320 mg/m², paclitaxel**
**175 mg/m², or 75 mg/m² docetaxel) intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by PD-L1 expression**
**(expression on <1% [IC0] or 1% to <5% [IC1] of tumour-infiltrating immune cells** **_vs ≥5% of tumour-infiltrating_**
**immune cells [IC2/3]), chemotherapy type (vinflunine** **_vs taxanes), liver metastases (yes_** **_vs no), and number of_**
**prognostic factors (none vs one, two, or three). Patients and investigators were aware of group allocation. Patients,**
**investigators, and the sponsor were masked to PD-L1 expression status. The primary endpoint of overall survival was**
**tested hierarchically in prespecified populations: IC2/3, followed by IC1/2/3, followed by the intention-to-treat**
**population. This study, which is ongoing but not recruiting participants, is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number**
**NCT02302807.**

**Findings** **Between Jan 13, 2015, and Feb 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 931 patients from 198 sites to receive**
**atezolizumab (n=467) or chemotherapy (n=464). In the IC2/3 population (n=234), overall survival did not differ**
**significantly between patients in the atezolizumab group and those in the chemotherapy group (median 11·1 months**

**[95% CI 8·6–15·5; n=116] vs 10·6 months [8·4–12·2; n=118]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·87, 95% CI 0·63–1·21;**
**p=0·41), thus precluding further formal statistical analysis. Confirmed objective response rates were similar between**
**treatment groups in the IC2/3 population: 26 (23%) of 113 evaluable patients had an objective response in the**
**atezolizumab group compared with 25 (22%) of 116 patients in the chemotherapy group. Duration of response was**
**numerically longer in the atezolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (median 15·9 months [95% CI 10·4 to**
**not estimable] vs 8·3 months [5·6–13·2]; HR 0·57, 95% CI 0·26–1·26). In the intention-to-treat population, patients**
**receiving atezolizumab had fewer grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events than did those receiving chemotherapy**
**(91 [20%] of 459 vs 189 [43%] of 443 patients), and fewer adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation (34 [7%]**
**_vs_** **78 [18%] patients).**

**Interpretation** **Atezolizumab was not associated with significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy in patients**
**with platinum-refractory metastatic urothelial carcinoma overexpressing PD-L1 (IC2/3). However, the safety profile for**
**atezolizumab was favourable compared with chemotherapy, Exploratory analysis of the intention-to-treat population**
**showed well-tolerated, durable responses in line with previous phase 2 data for atezolizumab in this setting.**

### Introduction
Advanced urothelial carcinoma has a poor prognosis,
with few patients surviving more than 5 years after
diagnosis.[1] First-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy can
improve overall survival,[2,3] but most patients have disease
progression Treatment patterns for locally advanced or


metastatic urothelial carcinoma following platinumcontaining chemotherapy vary globally. Vinflunine
(approved only in the European Union [EU]) and taxanes
are commonly used,[4,5] with prospective clinical data for
these drugs showing a modest median overall survival of
6–7 months in this setting [6,7] In the past few years

checkpoint inhibitors have changed the treatment of
metastatic urothelial carcinoma.[8] In a randomised phase
3 trial,[9] patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma
given pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed death-1
(PD-1) drug, had longer survival than did those given
chemotherapy. Additionally, atezolizumab—a mono­
clonal antibody that inhibits programmed death-ligand 1
(PD-L1) while leaving the PD-L2–PD-1 interaction
intact[10,11]—is active and well tolerated across multiple
cancers, including metastatic urothelial carcinoma.[11–16]

US approval of atezolizumab in patients with
platinum-treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma was
based on findings from phase 1 and 2 studies showing
durable responses with long-term clinical benefit.[12,16]
Although atezolizumab has shown activity in patients
with all levels of PD-L1 expression, response rates were
notably higher in patients with higher PD-L1 expression
on tumour-infiltrating immune cells.[12,16] We therefore
designed the IMvigor211 study to compare overall
survival with atezo­lizumab to that with chemotherapy by
PD-L1 expression in patients with platinum-treated
metastatic urothelial carcinoma. To increase our
understanding of the biology of metastatic urothelial
carcinoma, we also explored the relevance of tumour
mutation burden to overall survival Here we report


**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
Between Jan 1, 2005, and Sep 5, 2014, we searched PubMed
and international congress presentations pertaining to phase
3 studies of platinum-treated urothelial carcinoma. We
searched PubMed for articles published in English with medical
subject heading search terms ”advanced” AND “bladder cancer”,
“urothelial carcinoma”, “transitional cell carcinoma”. Before the
present study (IMvigor211), vinflunine was the only drug
approved by a health authority (in Europe) for the treatment of
advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after progression
with platinum-based chemotherapy based on phase 3 data.
Vinflunine and taxanes were commonly used drugs globally,
but no standard appeared to predominate, and these drugs
were associated with poor overall survival and toxicity. Because
cancer immunotherapies had provided breakthroughs in
numerous tumour types, and because urothelial carcinomas
might be especially immunogenic on the basis of high somatic
mutation burden, checkpoint inhibitor drugs targeting the
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)–anti-programmed
death-1 pathway warranted investigation in this setting.
Single-arm phase 1 and 2 data with atezolizumab from
2014–17 have demonstrated safety and activity in this setting
of previously treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma.

**Added value of this study**
To our knowledge, IMvigor211 is the first phase 3 randomised
trial to report results for an anti-PD-L1 antibody in patients with
metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Atezolizumab did not prolong


overall survival in the predefined population of patients with
PD-L1 expression on 5% or more of tumour-infiltrating immune
cells, which precluded further statistical analysis. The PD-L1
biomarker enriched for responses in both the chemotherapy and
the atezolizumab groups, which was unexpected and partly
accounted for the negative result of the trial. Atezolizumab was
associated with well tolerated, durable remissions in both the
PD-L1-selected and intention-to-treat populations—a finding
that was consistent with previous phase 2 data and that is
uncommon with chemotherapy. Exploratory analysis showed
differential overall survival benefit within the control group,
based on chemotherapy choice, which could have accounted for
some of the findings. Our results additionally show promise for
alternative biomarkers beyond PD-L1 expression, such as
tumour mutation burden. The data suggest that the risk–benefit
profile for atezolizumab could be acceptable in patients with
platinum-treated advanced urothelial carcinoma.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Five immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved in at
least one country for patients with platinum-treated metastatic
urothelial carcinoma. Data from randomised phase 3 trials exist
for only atezolizumab and pembrolizumab. These checkpoint
inhibitors appear attractive compared with chemotherapy in
unselected patients in this setting and have potential to change
the standard of care.

### Methods
#### Study design and patients
We conducted this multicentre, open-label, phase 3
randomised controlled trial at 217 academic medical
centres and community oncology practices mainly in
Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region
(appendix pp 9–12). The study protocol (appendix
pp 26–185) was approved by the independent ethics
committee of each study site.
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with
metastatic urothelial carcinoma, had measurable disease
at baseline as per Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors version 1·1 (RECIST v1.1), an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0 or 1, and an evaluable sample for PD-L1 testing
(regardless of PD-L1 status). Patients had received
no more than two previous lines of therapy and
had progressed during or following one or more
platinum-containing regimens for metastatic urothelial
carcinoma (or neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy with
progression within 12 months). A predominance of
transitional histology was required. We excluded patients
with previous autoimmune disease or those who

ITT=intention-to-treat. *One patient was assigned to chemotherapy twice (first to docetaxel, then to vinflunine) due to a randomisation error. This patient was
counted only once in this report. †An additional two deaths (n=1 per group) were collected from public records and were not recorded under study discontinuation, but
were included as uncensored deaths in the efficacy analyses. ‡As of data cutoff (March 13, 2017). An additional five deaths (n=4 in the chemotherapy group, n=1 in the
atezolizumab group) were collected from public records and are recorded under “patient withdrawals” and included as uncensored deaths in the efficacy analyses.


had received therapies targeting CD137, CTLA4, or
PD-L1–PD-1, and patients with symptomatic brain
metastasis or inadequate renal or liver function. The
appendix (pp 3–8) provides a full list of inclusion and
exclusion criteria. This study was done in accordance
with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written
informed consent.

#### Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive
voice and web response system (IXRS) with a permuted
block design (block size of four) to receive atezolizumab
or chemotherapy. Randomisation was stratified by
PD-L1 expression (expression on <1% [IC0] or 1% to
<5% [IC1] of tumour-infiltrating immune cells vs


≥5% of tumour-infiltrating immune cells [IC2/3]),
chemotherapy type (vinflunine _vs taxanes), liver_
metastases (yes _vs no), and number of prognostic_
factors (none _vs one, two, or three—defined as_
time from previous chemotherapy <3 months, ECOG
performance status ≥1, and haemo­globin <10 g/dL).
Investigators and participants were aware of treatment
allocation. The primary endpoint of overall survival
mitigates most potential biases associated with an
open-label study. Patients, investigators, and the
sponsor were masked to PD-L1 expression status.
Before randomisation, investigators selected a chemo­
therapy regimen (vinflunine, paclitaxel, or docetaxel)
that the patient had not previously received. The
sponsor was not permitted to do any populationlevel summaries of outcome data until the time of

primary analysis.

#### Procedures
Archival or fresh tumour samples were centrally and
prospectively evaluated with the VENTANA SP142 PD-L1
immunohistochemistry assay (Ventana Medical Systems,
Tucson, AZ, USA). Scoring criteria designated tumour
samples as IC2/3, IC1, or IC0. Patients received
atezolizumab 1200 mg or chemotherapy (vinflunine
320 mg/m², paclitaxel 175 mg/m², or docetaxel 75 mg/m²)
intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity,
RECIST v1.1 progression, or informed consent with­
drawal. Tumour imaging was done at baseline and every
9 weeks (every 12 weeks after week 54). Atezolizumab
treatment could continue beyond radiographic pro­


gression if deemed of clinical benefit by the investigator.
No prespecified crossover was planned per protocol.
Survival follow-up occurred every 3 months after
treatment discontinuation. National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
version 4.0 was used to assess adverse event frequency
and severity.
For analysis of tumour mutation burden, tumour
DNA extraction and preparation were done with
HistoGeneX NV (Antwerp, Belgium). Foundation
Medicine (Cambridge, MA, USA) did sequencing library
con­struction, hybridisation capture, DNA sequencing,
and genomic alteration detection.[17] In addition to
sample processing, Foundation Medicine estimated
the mutation burden for each sample using an algo­
rithm that leverages genomic alterations detected by the
targeted FoundationOne test to extrapolate to the whole
exome or genome.[18] We categorised tumour mutation
burden as high (at or above the median) or low (less than
the median).

#### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the
time from randomisation to death. Secondary efficacy
endpoints were investigator-assessed RECIST v1.1
objective response rate, progression-free survival, and
duration of response. Confirmed objective response rates
were exploratory. We additionally assessed safety and
prespecified patient-reported out­comes (European
Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 [EORTC QLQ-C30]
health-related quality of life, physical functioning, and
fatigue; appendix p 8).

#### Statistical analysis
This study was designed to enrol 931 patients, including at
least 230 patients with IC2/3 status and at least 537 with
IC1/2/3 status. Comparisons of overall survival between
treatment groups were tested with a hierarchical
fixed-sequence procedure based on a stratified log-rank
test at a two-sided level of 5% significance (similar to that
used for objective response rate)[15,16] in prespecified
populations: IC2/3, followed by IC1/2/3, followed by the
intention-to-treat population. The intention-to-treat
population included all randomly assigned patients
regardless of whether they received study treatment. The
IC2/3 and IC1/2/3 populations included all patients in
the intention-to-treat population with IC2/3 and IC1/2/3
status, respectively. Statistical significance was required at
each step before formal testing of the subsequent
population. If overall survival benefit with atezolizumab
was statistically significant in all three populations, the
null hypothesis of no difference in overall survival between
the two groups was rejected, and key secondary efficacy
endpoints could then be tested in the same order (ie,
objective response rate followed by progression-free
survival) The primary efficacy analysis was planned when


-----

roughly 152 deaths were observed in the IC2/3 population,
403 deaths were observed in the IC1/2/3 population, and
652 deaths were observed in the intention-to-treat
population, whichever occurred last. There was no
planned maximum follow-up period or interim analysis
based on the event-driven endpoints per protocol. The
number of events required to demonstrate overall survival
benefit with atezolizumab versus chemotherapy were
estimated on the basis of a two-sided significance level
of 5%, 94% power in the IC2/3 subgroup analysis
with an hazard ratio (HR) of 0·57 (corresponding to a
median overall survival improvement from 7·5 months
to 13·2 months), 98% power in the IC1/2/3 analysis with
an HR of 0·68 (corresponding to a median overall
survival improvement from 7·5 months to 11 months),
97% power for the intention-to-treat population with
an HR of 0·74 (corresponding to a median overall survival
improvement from 7·5 months to 10·1 months),
a 1:1 randomisation ratio, and a dropout rate of 5% per
year over 24 months.
In analysis of overall survival, patients who were not
reported to have died by the data cutoff date were censored
at the last date they were known to be alive (or at
randomisation day for those with no post-baseline data).
We used the Kaplan–Meier approach to estimate overall
survival, progression-free survival, and duration of
response, with Brookmeyer–Crowley methodology used
to estimate 95% CIs. HRs were estimated with a stratified
Cox regression analysis (stratification factors were the
same as those used for randomisation, unless otherwise
indicated). RECIST v1.1 objective response rates and
95% CIs for each treatment group were calculated with
the Clopper–Pearson method and were compared
between groups with the Mantel–Haenszel test. We used
descriptive statistics to summarise study drug exposure
(treatment duration, number of doses, and dose intensity)
for each treatment group. Safety-evaluable patients
included randomised patients who received any amount
of study treatment. Deaths were reported during the study
or follow-up period and summarised by treatment group.
We did statistical analysis with SAS (version 9.2). An
independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety
roughly every 6 months. This study, which is ongoing
but not recruiting participants, is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02302807.

#### Role of the funding source
The sponsor of the study had a role in study design, data
collection, data analysis, and data interpretation. All
authors had full access to all the data in the study, and the
corresponding author had final responsibility for the
decision to submit for publication.

### Results
Between Jan 13, 2015, and Feb 15, 2016, we randomly
assigned 931 patients (intention-to-treat population) from
198 sites (appendix pp 9–12) to receive atezolizumab


(n=467) or chemotherapy (n=464; figure 1). The treated
(safety-evaluable) population included 902 patients
(figure 1). Of 443 patients who received chemotherapy,
242 (55%) received vinflunine, 148 (33%) received
paclitaxel, and 53 (12%) received docetaxel (figure 1).
Baseline characteristics between groups were similar in
both the IC2/3 and intention-to-treat populations (table 1).
At data cutoff (March 13, 2017) in the intention-totreat population, 133 (28%) of 467 patients remained
in the study in the atezolizumab group, and
89 (19%) of 464 patients remained in the study in the
chemotherapy group (figure 1). Treated patients received
atezolizumab for a median of 2·8 months (range 0–24),
vinflunine for a median of 2·1 months (0–15), paclitaxel
for a median of 2·1 months (0–23), and docetaxel for a
median of 1·6 months (0–10). 81 (18%) patients who
received atezolizumab, 12 (5%) who received vinflunine,
and two (1%) who received paclitaxel were treated for
1 year or more. At data cutoff, 65 (14%) patients receiving
atezolizumab and nine (2%) patients receiving chemo­
therapy remained on treatment (figure 1). After treatment
discontinuation, 108 (23%) patients in the atezolizumab
group and 118 (25%) patients in the chemotherapy group
received at least one subsequent non-protocol treatment
(appendix p 13), with 28 (6%) patients in the chemotherapy
group receiving post-protocol immunotherapy. The
median follow-up duration in the intention-to-treat
population was 17·3 months (range 0–24·5). A total of
674 (72%) deaths occurred: 324 in the atezolizumab group
and 350 in the chemotherapy group

Complete data for progression-free survival and duration of response are shown in table 2. Vertical lines indicate
censored events (death or progression). HR=hazard ratio. *In the subset of patients with objective response.

The efficacy analysis was first done in the IC2/3
population. Overall survival did not differ significantly
between the atezolizumab group and the chemotherapy
group (median 11·1 months [95% CI 8·6–15·5] _vs_
10·6 months [8·4–12·2]; stratified HR 0·87, 95% CI
0·63–1·21; p=0·41; figure 2), precluding further formal
statistical comparisons and rendering subsequent
analyses exploratory in nature Exploratory forest plot


analyses for overall survival were evaluated in subgroups
on the basis of baseline characteristics (appendix p 18).
Most efficacy differences between treatment groups were
marginal (appendix p 18). For patients receiving
chemotherapy, vinflunine outperformed study expec­
tations; unstratified HRs were 0·95 (95% CI 0·62–1·45)
and 0·69 (0·44–1·10) in subgroups based on chemo­
therapy stratification with vinflunine (n=106) and taxanes
(n=128), respectively. We also recorded variations in
overall survival HRs for upper-tract renal pelvis urothelial
tumours (appendix p 18).
Confirmed objective response rates were similar between
treatment groups in the IC2/3 population (table 2).
16 (62%) of 26 responders to atezolizumab and five (20%) of
25 responders to chemotherapy had ongoing responses;
the duration of response was numerically longer in
the atezolizumab group (table 2, figure 2). Progressionfree survival was numerically longer in patients given
chemotherapy; however, patients given atezolizumab had
fewer progression-free survival events (table 2, figure 2).
The proportion of patients with adverse events
was similar between groups in the IC2/3 and intentionto-treat populations, although results for the intention-totreat population were more robust in view of the higher
number of patients (table 3). In the IC2/3 population,
treatment-related adverse events leading to treatment
discontinuation occurred in seven (6%) of 114 patients in
the atezolizumab group and 17 (15%) of 112 patients in
the chemotherapy group (appendix p 14). We recorded
two (2%) atezolizumab-related deaths and two (2%)
chemotherapy-related deaths in the IC2/3 population.
These safety results were mirrored in the intention-totreat population, in which treatment discontinuations due
to adverse events occurred in 16 (3%) of 459 patients in the
atezolizumab group and 63 (14%) of 443 patients in the
chemotherapy group; treatment-related deaths occurred
in four (1%) and nine (2%) patients, respectively
(appendix pp 14, 15). Adverse events of any grade deemed
treatment related by the investigator occurred in 85 (75%)
atezolizumab-treated patients versus 99 (88%) chemo­
therapy-treated patients in the IC2/3 population (table 3).
For both the IC2/3 and intention-to-treat populations,
treatment-related adverse events occurring in 10% or
more of patients in both groups were fatigue, asthenia,
decreased appetite, and diarrhoea (table 3). For both
populations, treatment-related fatigue, nausea, con­
stipation, and alopecia of any grade occurred in 22% or
more of patients receiving chemotherapy, but did not
meet this threshold for patients receiving atezolizumab
(table 3). Conversely, treatment-related pruritus was more
common in the atezolizumab group of the IC2/3 and the
intention-to-treat populations (table 3). In the IC2/3
population, treatment-related rash was likewise more
common with atezolizumab then chemotherapy (table 3).
In both the IC2/3 and intention-to-treat populations,
grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were less
common with atezolizumab than chemotherapy (table 3)


-----

Subsequent overall survival analyses were done in the
intention-to-treat population for exploratory purposes
only (figure 3, appendix p 19). We did this analysis for
two primary reasons: to explore potential reasons for
the negative primary endpoint in the IC2/3 population
and to inform understanding around the hypothesis
that atezolizumab would provide benefit regardless of
PD-L1 expression, but would perform better in the
IC2/3 subgroup. Overall survival in the intention-totreat population was numerically improved in the
atezolizumab group compared with the chemotherapy
group (figure 3). At 12 months, the overall survival rate
was 39·2% (95% CI 34·8–43·7) with atezolizumab and
32·4% (28·0–36·8) with chemotherapy (figure 3).
Results from prespecified subgroup analyses of overall
survival in the intention-to-treat population by baseline
and clinical characteristics generally agreed with those
from the IC2/3 population (figure 3). In exploratory
analyses we additionally assessed overall survival in the
intention-to-treat population by investigator-prespecified
chemotherapy subgroup (taxane and vinflunine).
Atezolizumab demonstrated better comparative overall
survival in patients intended for treatment with taxanes
(median 8·3 months [95% CI 6·6–9·8; n=215]
_vs_ 7·5 months [6·7–8·6; n=214]; HR 0·73, 95% CI
0·58–0·92), but not in those given vinflunine (median
9·2 months [7·9–10·4; n=252] vs 8·3 months [6·9–9·6;
n=250]; 0·97, 0·78–1·19; appendix p 21).
Confirmed objective response rates were lower for
both atezolizumab-treated and chemotherapy-treated
patients in the intention-to-treat population than for
those in the IC2/3 population (table 2). Median response
durations were longer with atezolizumab than
chemotherapy in the intention-to-treat population
(table 2, figure 3), mirroring the results in the IC2/3
population (table 2, figure 2). In the intention-to-treat
population, 39 (63%) of 62 responders receiving
atezolizumab had ongoing responses compared with
13 (21%) of 62 responders receiving chemotherapy.
Progression-free survival in this population was
longer in patients given chemotherapy than in those
given atezolizumab (table 2, figure 2). The appendix
(pp 16, 20, 22) shows results for additional exploratory
analyses of key efficacy endpoints (overall survival,
objective response rate and duration, and progressionfree survival) for the IC1/2/3 population.
In an exploratory biomarker analysis, 544 (58%) of
931 patients in the intention-to-treat population
had tumour samples evaluable for measurement of
tumour mutation burden. Baseline characteristics of
the overall biomarker-evaluable population, including
PD-L1 status (appendix p 23), were generally balanced
between treatment groups and representative of the
intention-to-treat population. Median tumour mutation
burden in the biomarker-evaluable population was
9·65 mutations per megabase (IQR 8·78) and was also
similar between groups (appendix p 23) The correlation


observed between PD-L1 expression and tumour
mutation burden was modest (r=0·13). We assessed
overall survival based on patients whose samples had
high (at or above the median) or low (below the median)
values for tumour mutation burden (appendix p 23). For
patients with samples with high tumour mutation
burden (n=274), overall survival was numerically longer
for those treated with atezolizumab than for those
treated with chemotherapy (median 11·3 months

[95% CI 8·7–13·2] vs 8·3 months [7·2–10·4]; HR 0·68,
95% CI 0·51–0·90), whereas for those with samples
with low tumour mutation burden (n=270), survival was
similar between groups (median 8·3 months [6·4–9·8]
_vs 8·1 months [6·2–10·4]; 1·00,_ 0·75–1·32; appendix
p 23). We next evaluated whether PD-L1 status conferred
a survival advantage for patients with samples with high
tumour mutation burden (appendix p 23). In patients
with samples with high tumour mutation burden and
PD-L1 IC2/3 samples (n=96), median survival for
patients given atezolizumab was 17·8 months (95% CI
9·7–not estimable) versus 10·6 months (8·2–14·3) for
those given chemotherapy (HR 0·50, 95% CI 0·29–0·86;
appendix p 23).
In a further analysis, we evaluated prespecified
patient-reported outcomes based on EORTC QLQ-C30
global health status, physical functioning, and fatigue
scores (appendix pp 24, 25), and measured baseline
scores in the intention-to-treat population (appendix p 17).
Mean changes in these scores initially deteriorated,
but returned to baseline after several cycles and re­


-----

mained stable thereafter for the atezolizumab group;
mean scores changes were worse, particularly for
fatigue, in the chemotherapy group (appendix p 25).
Although event-to-patient deterioration rates remained
low at time of analysis, median time to deterioration was
similar between groups for global health status and


prolonged with atezolizumab for physical function and
fatigue (appendix p 24).

### Discussion
In this randomised phase 3 study, the primary endpoint
of overall survival improvement with atezolizumab was
not met in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma
with at least 5% PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating
immune cells, precluding additional formal statistical
analysis. Our hierarchical study design hypothesised
that efficacy would be associated with PD-L1 expression
on the basis of phase 1 and 2 findings with
atezolizumab[12,16,19] and other checkpoint inhibitors.[20,21]
Unexpectedly, in our study, overexpression of PD-L1
(SP142 immunohistochemistry assay) resulted in a
more favourable outcome (longer overall survival and
increased response rates) with both chemotherapy and
atezolizumab, negating its potentially predictive effects.
The reasons for these results remain unclear and differ
from previous positive phase 3 studies of atezolizumab
in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer[14]
and pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic
urothelial carcinoma (KEYNOTE-045).[9] An ex­planation
for these inverse results is not readily available,
although PD-L1 assay disparities—widespread in this
field[22]—might contribute to these differences. Indeed,
the assay used in KEYNOTE-045 (22C3 antibody)
measured PD-L1 expression on both immune and
tumour cells, which, unlike SP142, was associated with
a poor prognosis.[9] These results underscore the risks of
biomarker-focused statistical designs without supportive
randomised data, and highlight the need for improved
predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy.[23,24]
Kaplan–Meier analysis also revealed non-proportional
hazards, with curve separation and inflection occurring
relatively late. This outcome is common with immune
checkpoint inhibitors,[9,25] but appears more pronounced
here, partially accounting for the statistical findings of
the study. Atezolizumab was associated with a longer
duration of response, consistent with other immune
checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic urothelial carcinoma
and associated with notable 12 month landmark
overall survival rates.
The adverse event profile for atezolizumab was
favourable compared with chemotherapy for both
the IC2/3 and intention-to-treat populations. Patients
receiving atezolizumab had lower rates of adverse
events leading to treatment discontinuation and fewer
treatment-related adverse events than did those receiving
chemotherapy. The safety profiles for cancer immuno­
therapies and chemotherapy are distinct; rates for
grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest were less
than 10% for atezolizumab in IC2/3 and intention-totreat patients, with immune-mediated events generally
consistent with previous atezolizumab studies.[16] These
data further translated to sustained health-related quality
of life with atezolizumab


-----

Because of an absence of global consensus, the control
group permitted different chemotherapy regimens;
however, our results revealed numerical differences
when efficacy was evaluated by chemotherapy type.
Survival with vinflunine was better than the protocol
hypothesised on the basis of previous studies,[6,9]
potentially compromising the statistical assumptions.
This finding was not exclusive to the PD-L1-selected
subgroups, but was also noted in the intention-to-treat
population. Although previous data suggested similar
overall survival rates for vinflunine, paclitaxel, and
docetaxel,[6,7] comparative randomised studies with these
drugs have not been done, which calls into question the
suitability of a mixed control group and potentially affects
our results. Furthermore, improved clinical proficiency
and post-approval patient selection in western Europe,[26–29]
where most patients were enrolled, might have also
contributed to these findings. The primary analysis of
KEYNOTE-045 did not pursue a hierarchical PD-L1
biomarker-driven approach and demonstrated positive
survival results for pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy;
however, comparisons between biomarker-selected and
unselected trials are challenging because of intrinsic
differences in patient populations.
We did prespecified exploratory efficacy analyses of the
intention-to-treat population to better understand the
results of the study and evaluate atezolizumab versus
chemotherapy in a biomarker-unselected comparison,
which, with more than 900 patients treated in that
population, is to our knowledge the largest interventional
study of metastatic urothelial carcinoma. Median
survival rates were shorter in the intention-to-treat
population than in the IC2/3 population, potentially due
to the enrichment of responders occurring in both
groups in the IC2/3 cohort. Comparative efficacy signals
(overall survival HR 0·85, 95% CI 0·73–0·99) were
similar to those in the IC2/3 population, underlining the
problem with our biomarker enrichment hypothesis for
the primary endpoint. Toxicity and duration of response
for the IC2/3 and intention-to-treat populations were
similar. Exploratory analysis showed that notable 1 year
milestone survival rates were achieved with atezolizumab
compared with chemotherapy in the intention-totreat population (39·2% _vs 32·4%). Similar to the_
IC2/3 subgroup, delayed separation of the Kaplan–Meier
curves was observed when indirectly compared with
KEYNOTE-045. Median progression-free survival is
short for all immune checkpoint inhibitors in this
setting, irrespective of biomarker selection. Different
strategies will be required to achieve disease control in
most patients. These data from the intention-to-treat
population were not formally tested for statistical
significance. However, in view of the high unmet need
in this population, the well tolerated, durable remissions
observed with atezolizumab, and the complications
associated with chemotherapy, the benefit–risk ratio for
atezolizumab can be considered favourable for patients

with metastatic urothelial carcinoma previously treated
with platinum-containing regimens. Atezolizumab is
approved in this setting in the US.[30] EU approval
of atezolizumab was granted in patients with
platinum-treated metastatic urothelial carcinoma partly
on the basis of these data.[31]

We attempted to identify alternative biomarkers for
atezolizumab in view of the absence of predictive values
for the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry biomarker. Tumour
mu­tation burden, which is high in bladder cancer, is
thought to be a surrogate marker for neoantigen
expression and might be required for immune recognition
of tumours. Previous exploratory studies have shown that
tumour mutation burden outperforms PD-L1 expression
as a biomarker for nivolumab in other tumour types.[32]
Our study showed similar results. These consistent
results across different tumour types suggest similar
broad mechanisms of action for this group of drugs.
These results are hypothesis generating; if validated
in future trials, tumour mutation burden—alone or
with other biomarkers—could improve the accuracy of
selection of patients for monotherapy.
