**BACKGROUND**
The programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor pembrolizumab has been found to prolong
progression-free and overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma. We conducted a phase 3 double-blind trial to evaluate pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy in
patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma.

**METHODS**
Patients with completely resected stage III melanoma were randomly assigned (with
stratification according to cancer stage and geographic region) to receive 200 mg of
pembrolizumab (514 patients) or placebo (505 patients) intravenously every 3 weeks for
a total of 18 doses (approximately 1 year) or until disease recurrence or unacceptable
toxic effects occurred. Recurrence-free survival in the overall intention-to-treat population and in the subgroup of patients with cancer that was positive for the PD-1 ligand
(PD-L1) were the primary end points. Safety was also evaluated.

**RESULTS**
At a median follow-up of 15 months, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly
longer recurrence-free survival than placebo in the overall intention-to-treat population
(1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 75.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 71.3 to 78.9] vs.
61.0% [95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1]; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to
0.74; P<0.001) and in the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1–positive tumors (1-year rate
of recurrence-free survival, 77.1% [95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9] in the pembrolizumab group and
62.6% [95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.69;
P<0.001). Adverse events of grades 3 to 5 that were related to the trial regimen were reported
in 14.7% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 3.4% of patients in the placebo
group. There was one treatment-related death due to myositis in the pembrolizumab group.

**CONCLUSIONS**
As adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage III melanoma, 200 mg of pembrolizumab administered every 3 weeks for up to 1 year resulted in significantly longer recurrencefree survival than placebo, with no new toxic effects identified. (Funded by Merck;

-----

he development of effective adjuvant therapies for patients with high-risk
melanoma has been preceded by the recent arrival of active agents to treat metastatic T
melanoma, including ipilimumab (an anti-CTLA4
antibody), pembrolizumab and nivolumab (both
monoclonal antibodies against programmed
death 1 [PD-1]), and combination BRAF and MEK
inhibition for patients whose tumors harbor a
_BRAF mutation.[1-6] Pembrolizumab has been found_
to be associated with longer progression-free
survival and overall survival in advanced melanoma than ipilimumab, regardless of PD-1 ligand
(PD-L1) expression level and _BRAF mutation_
status.[5] Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy of
these drugs as adjuvant therapy for patients with
resected high-risk melanoma have been undertaken. In 2015, ipilimumab was approved on the
basis of a significant advantage over placebo
with regard to recurrence-free survival in resected
stage III melanoma, and a similar advantage for
overall survival was shown in 2016.[7,8] In 2017,
dabrafenib–trametinib and nivolumab were independently shown to have efficacy in resected
_BRAF-mutant melanoma of stage III and in re-_
sected _BRAF-mutant and_ _BRAF–wild-type mela-_
noma of stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV, respectively.[9,10] The
European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 1325 (KEYNOTE-054)
trial involved the same high-risk patient population with stage III melanoma as the EORTC
18071 trial of ipilimumab versus placebo, which
limits its trial population to patients with stage
IIIA disease who have a high risk of recurrence
based on tumor load in the sentinel node (diameter, >1 mm, according to the Rotterdam Criteria).[11-13] In the randomized, double-blind, phase 3
EORTC 1325 trial, we compared pembrolizumab
(200 mg every 3 weeks) with matching placebo
as adjuvant therapy for patients with resected,
high-risk stage III melanoma.


Methods


**Patients**
We enrolled patients who were 18 years of age or
older and had histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma with metastasis to regional lymph
nodes. The patients had to have either stage IIIA
melanoma (patients with stage N1a melanoma
had to have at least one micrometastasis measuring >1 mm in greatest diameter) or stage IIIB


or IIIC disease with no in-transit metastases as
defined by the American Joint Committee on
Cancer 2009 classification, 7th edition.[14] A complete regional lymphadenectomy was required to
have been performed within 13 weeks before the
start of treatment. Exclusion criteria included an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status score of more than 1 (scores
range from 0 to 5, with higher numbers indicating greater disability), autoimmune disease, uncon­
trolled infections, use of systemic glucocorticoids,
and previous systemic therapy for melanoma.
A tumor sample from melanoma-positive
lymph nodes was required to be sent for central
pathological evaluation of PD-L1 expression.
Membranous expression of PD-L1 in tumor and
tumor-associated immune cells was assessed by
means of a clinical trial immunohistochemistry
assay (22C3 antibody) and was scored on a scale
of 0 to 5 that has been developed specifically for
melanoma (with higher numbers reflecting a
higher level of PD-L1 expression); a score of 2 or
higher (i.e., staining on >1% of cells) was considered to indicate PD-L1 positivity.[15]

**Trial Design**
Registration was performed centrally at the
EORTC headquarters. A central interactive voiceresponse system was used for randomization,
which was based on a minimization technique.
Randomization was stratified according to stage
(stage IIIA, stage IIIB, stage IIIC with one to
three positive nodes, or stage IIIC with four or
more positive nodes) and geographic region (17
regions, each formed by 1 to 3 countries). Only
the local pharmacists were aware of trial-group
assignments, whereas the clinical investigators,
patients, and those collecting or analyzing the
data were not.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio
to receive either an intravenous infusion of 200 mg
of pembrolizumab or placebo every 3 weeks for
a total of 18 doses (approximately 1 year [part 1 of
the trial]) or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxic effects, a major protocol violation, or
withdrawal of consent occurred (Fig. S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full
text of this article at NEJM.org). The rules regarding the withholding of a dose of pembrolizumab
or placebo and the management of immunerelated adverse events are detailed in the protocol, available at NEJM.org. If a recurrence was


2 n engl j med nejm org


-----

documented, patients were eligible for crossover
or repeat treatment with pembrolizumab (part 2
of the trial).
The primary end point was recurrence-free
survival in the overall intention-to-treat population
and in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1–
positive tumors. Secondary end points included
distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival,
safety measures, and measures of health-related
quality of life.

**Assessments**
Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both were performed every 12 weeks
for the first 2 years, every 6 months through
year 5, then annually. Recurrence or metastatic
lesions had to be histologically confirmed whenever possible. The first date when recurrence was
observed was taken into account.
Recurrence-free survival was defined as the
time from randomization until the date of first
recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death from any cause. For patients without any event, follow-up was censored at the
latest disease evaluation performed according to
the trial protocol.
Data on adverse events were collected for
each treatment course with the use of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Immunerelated adverse events were programmatically
determined from a predefined list of _Medical_
_Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms,_
which was updated in accordance with each new
version of MedDRA.

**Trial Oversight**
The trial protocol was approved by the EORTC
protocol review committee and independent ethics
committees. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with
Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation. All patients
provided written informed consent.
The trial was sponsored by Merck and was
designed by the academic authors. Data were
collected, computerized, and analyzed at the
EORTC headquarters. All the authors participated
in the revision and finalization of the manuscript
and approved submission of the manuscript for
publication. The authors vouch for the accuracy
and completeness of the data and for the adher

ence of the trial to the protocol. No one who is
not an author contributed to the writing of the
manuscript.
The EORTC independent data and safety
monitoring committee assessed the safety data
twice per year, without formal stopping rules. In
December 2017, the independent data and safety
monitoring committee also assessed the first
analysis of recurrence-free survival, which was
performed by an independent statistician. On-site
source-data verification was provided by a clinical research organization.

**Statistical Analysis**
We planned for the trial to include 900 patients.
We determined that a total of 409 events (recurrences or deaths without recurrences) would be
required in order to provide 92% power to detect
a hazard ratio for recurrence or death of 0.70,
corresponding to a 1-year recurrence-free survival rate of 58.3% in the placebo group versus
68.5% in the pembrolizumab group and a 3-year
recurrence-free survival rate of 35.3% in the placebo group versus 48.3% in the pembrolizumab
group, at a one-sided alpha level of 1.4%. If the
results in the overall intention-to-treat population were significant, the treatment comparison
would be performed in the subgroup of patients
with PD-L1–positive tumors at a one-sided alpha
level of 2.5%.[16]

In July 2017, the positive results of the CheckMate 238 trial, in which the effect of adjuvant
therapy in melanoma with nivolumab or ipilimu­
mab was evaluated, were announced, and they
were subsequently published in September 2017.[10]
The estimated hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death in association with nivolumab
versus ipilimumab was 0.65 (97.56% confidence
interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.83), on the basis of an
interim analysis. In August 2017, the EORTC
1325 protocol was amended to include an interim analysis of recurrence-free survival based on
the 1019 patients who underwent randomization,
conducted with the use a Lan–DeMets alpha
spending function with an O’Brien–Fleming
boundary.[17] At the clinical cutoff date (October 2,
2017), 351 events (recurrences or deaths) had
been reported in the intention-to-treat population. The interim analysis was performed at a
one-sided alpha level of 0.8% (two-sided alpha
level, 1.6%). In December 2017, the independent
data and safety monitoring committee reviewed


n engl j med nejm org 3


-----

the unblinded results and recommended the reporting of the primary end points and safety.
Because the results were positive in the intentionto-treat population, the interim analysis of recurrence-free survival became the final analysis. To
preserve the alpha error, a hierarchical testing
approach will be applied to the two remaining
efficacy end points — distant metastasis–free
survival first, and then overall survival (see the
protocol).
The recurrence-free survival distribution was
estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, and
the confidence intervals for the 12- and 18-month
survival rates were obtained with the Greenwood
variance formula. Comparisons between the
trial groups were performed with the use of
a log-rank test stratified according to disease
stage at randomization, at a two-sided alpha
level. A Cox proportional-hazards model stratified according to disease stage as provided at
randomization was used to estimate the hazard
ratio and its corresponding confidence interval,
which was 98.4% (100 minus 1.6) for the total
patient population and 95% (100 minus [2 times
2.5]) for the PD-L1–positive subgroup.
For exploratory purposes, we investigated the
predictive importance of several factors with regard to the differences in recurrence-free survival. Forest plots were produced, and a test of
interaction between each variable and the trial
group in a Cox model was conducted. For these
subgroup analyses, the hazard ratios were plotted along with their 99% confidence intervals.
The primary analysis of recurrence-free survival included all the patients who underwent
randomization, according to the intention-totreat principle. The safety profile was assessed
in the group of patients who started their randomly assigned trial regimen. All analyses were
performed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS
Institute), and the power calculations were performed with East software, version 6.4 (Cytel).


Results


**Patients and Trial Regimen**
From August 2015 through November 2016, a
total of 1019 patients underwent randomization
at 123 centers in 23 countries: 514 patients were
assigned to the pembrolizumab group, and 505
were assigned to the placebo group. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar
in the two groups (Table 1).


Eight patients did not start the regimen that
had been randomly assigned (Fig. 1). The median
number of doses received was 18 (interquartile
range, 9 to 18) in the pembrolizumab group and
18 (interquartile range, 8 to 18) in the placebo
group.
Of the 509 patients who started pembrolizu­
mab, 70 (13.8%) discontinued the regimen owing
to an adverse event; in 66 patients (13.0%), the
event was considered by the investigators to be
drug-related. Among the 502 patients who received placebo, 11 (2.2%) discontinued the regimen owing to an adverse event; in 8 patients
(1.6%), the event was considered to be placeborelated. A total of 109 patients (21.4%) in the
pembrolizumab group discontinued the regimen
because of disease recurrence, as compared with
179 patients (35.7%) in the placebo group. A
total of 282 patients (55.4%) in the pembrolizu­
mab group and 294 (58.6%) in the placebo group
completed the 1-year treatment period (Fig. 1).
The overall median duration of follow-up was
15.1 months — 14.7 months in the pembrolizu­
mab group and 15.4 months in the placebo group.

**Efficacy**
_Overall Intention-to-Treat Population_
In the overall intention-to-treat population, the
12-month rate of recurrence-free survival was
75.4% (95% CI, 71.3 to 78.9) in the pembrolizu­
mab group and 61.0% (95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1) in
the placebo group (Fig. 2A). Recurrence-free
survival was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI,
0.43 to 0.74; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). The results were
similar in the per-protocol population (hazard
ratio for recurrence or death, stratified according to stage, 0.56; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to 0.74;
P<0.001). At 18 months, the rates of recurrencefree survival in the intention-to-treat population
were 71.4% (95% CI, 66.8 to 75.4) in the pembrolizumab group and 53.2% (95% CI, 47.9 to
58.2) in the placebo group.
A total of 351 patients had a first recurrence
of disease or died: 135 in the pembrolizumab
group and 216 in the placebo group. There were
78 patients (15.2%) in the pembrolizumab group
in whom distant metastases developed, alone or
combined with locoregional recurrences, as compared with 138 patients (27.3%) in the placebo
group (Fig. 2A). The 18-month cumulative incidence of distant metastasis being the first site of

recurrence was 16.7% and 29.7% respectively
(hazard ratio, 0.53; 99% CI, 0.37 to 0.76) (Fig. S2
in the Supplementary Appendix).

_Recurrence-free Survival According to Tumor PD-L1_
_Expression_
In the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1–
positive tumors (melanoma score, ≥2), the
12-month recurrence-free survival rate was 77.1%
(95% CI, 72.7 to 80.9) in the pembrolizumab
group and 62.6% (95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0) in the


placebo group (Fig. 2B). Recurrence-free survival
was significantly longer in the pembrolizumab
group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio
for recurrence or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to
0.69; P<0.001). Pembrolizumab was also consistently effective in patients with PD-L1–negative
tumors (Figs. 2C and 3) and in those with undetermined tumor PD-L1 expression (Fig. S3 in the
Supplementary Appendix).

_Recurrence-free Survival According to Other_
_Variables_
The between-group difference in recurrence-free
survival was consistently observed across subgroups that were based on baseline characteristics (Fig. 3). The benefit from pembrolizumab
was similar in patients with stage IIIA, IIIB, and
IIIC disease; the 12-month rate of recurrencefree survival among patients with stage IIIB or
IIIC disease in the pembrolizumab group was
72.2% (95% CI, 67.6 to 76.2). The benefit from
pembrolizumab was also similar in patients

with microscopic or macroscopic nodal involvement; it was greater, but not significantly so, in
patients with ulcerated melanomas (hazard ratio,
0.52) than in patients with nonulcerated melano

baseline body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in
meters) did not significantly influence the dif

ference in recurrence-free survival between the
pembrolizumab and placebo groups (Fig. 3, and
Figs. S4 and S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
For instance, the between-group difference was
similar among men regardless of whether they
were obese or had a normal body-mass index.

**Safety**
Adverse events of any grade that were considered
to be related to the trial regimen occurred in 396
patients (77.8%) in the pembrolizumab group
and in 332 patients (66.1%) in the placebo group
(Table 2). The rates of fatigue or asthenia and of
diarrhea were similar in the two trial groups.
Adverse events of grade 3, 4, or 5 that were
related to the trial regimen occurred in 14.7% of
patients in the pembrolizumab group and in
3.4% in the placebo group. There was one pembrolizumab-related death due to myositis.
Immune-related adverse events of any grade
occurred in 190 (37.3%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 45 (9.0%) patients in the
placebo group. A higher incidence of endocrine
disorders occurred in the pembrolizumab group
than in the placebo group (23.4% in the pembrolizumab group and 5.0% in the placebo group);
the most common endocrine disorders were
hypothyroidism (14.3% and 2.8%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2% and 1.2%), and all cases were of
grade 1 or 2 except one case of grade 3 hyperthyroidism. The incidence of sarcoidosis was low
(1.4% and 0%), and all cases were of grade 1 or
2. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 immune-related
adverse events was also low (7.1% and 0.6%);
grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events included colitis (2.0% and 0.2%), hypophysitis or
hypopituitarism (0.6% and 0%), and type 1 diabetes mellitus (1.0% and 0%). In the pembrolizu­
mab group, a total of 43 grade 3 or 4 immunerelated adverse events occurred in 36 patients
(7.1%). Among these events, 34 resolved, including 21 within 2 months after the last dose of
pembrolizumab.


Discussion


In this randomized, phase 3 trial involving patients with resected, high-risk stage III melanoma, pembrolizumab was associated with a rate
of recurrence-free survival at 1 year that was
significantly higher than that with placebo. The
risk of recurrence or death in the total popula

tion was 43% lower in the pembrolizumab group
than in the placebo group; the risk was 46%
lower in the pembrolizumab group than in the
placebo group among patients with PD-L1–positive tumors, with similar results in the subgroup
with PD-L1–negative tumors. In the overall intention-to-treat population, the estimated betweengroup difference in the 18-month rate of recurrence-free survival was 18.2 percentage points
(71.4% for pembrolizumab vs. 53.2% for placebo).
These data provide more evidence that drugs
that are effective in advanced melanoma also
have effectiveness as adjuvant therapy.[18]

The EORTC 1325 trial will continue to its
secondary end points, distant metastasis-free
survival and overall survival. We recently found
that the effects of treatment on recurrence-free
survival correlate very well with the effects on
overall survival in trials of adjuvant therapy with
interferon alfa and with ipilimumab in high-risk
melanoma.[19] Therefore, one may reasonably expect
that the benefit of pembrolizumab for relapse-free
survival that we have found in our trial will translate into an overall survival benefit, unless effective post-relapse treatments compensate for the
initial disadvantage; this is a question that may
be answered by the crossover design of the trial.
Pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy, which in
this analysis had a rate of grade 3 or higher
treatment-related adverse events of 14.7%, appears to be less toxic than ipilimumab (45.9%)
and similar to nivolumab (14.4%). There was one
pembrolizumab-related death (0.2%), as compared with none with nivolumab and five (1.1%)
with ipilimumab in the respective trials of these
agents as adjuvant therapy.[7,8,10] The immune-related
adverse events that were relatively frequent in
association with pembrolizumab were hypothyroidism (14.3%) and hyperthyroidism (10.2%),
pneumonitis (3.3%), and sarcoidosis (1.4%), with
the majority of events being of grade 1 or 2. The
incidence of grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events was low (7.1%), and most events
resolved within 2 months after the last dose of
pembrolizumab, findings similar to those in advanced melanoma.[20,21]

Adjuvant therapy for high-risk melanoma has
improved, with pembrolizumab and nivolumab
now available as effective agents, along with the
combination of dabrafenib and trametinib as an
additional option for _BRAF-mutant melanoma._

(in which patients with disease recurrence were eligible to cross over or receive repeat treatment with pembrolizumab).
The severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 4.0.

take years, the use of interferon alfa may continue; however, on the basis of the EORTC 18952
and 18991 trials[22-26] and an individual-patient data
meta-analysis comprising all trials in which
interferon alfa was compared with observation
only,[27] interferon alfa treatment would be limited
to patients with stage IIB or III disease with ulcerated melanoma.
Although completion lymph-node dissection
has been a mandatory component in all adjuvant
phase 3 trials to date, in light of the results of
the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial
(MSLT-II) and the Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group (DeCOG) trial[18,28-30] it is no longer
considered mandatory. Since the hazard ratios
for recurrence or death among the sentinel node–
positive patients in the nivolumab, pembrolizu­
mab, and dabrafenib–trametinib trials are low,
adjuvant therapy also seems reasonable in patients in this group who are not undergoing
a completion lymph-node dissection; however,
it must be acknowledged that data from these
trials do not speak directly to this point.


In conclusion, pembrolizumab as adjuvant
therapy for patients with resected, high-risk
stage III melanoma was associated with a significantly longer recurrence-free survival than
placebo and had a safety profile consistent with
the toxicity spectrum that has already been defined for the drug.
