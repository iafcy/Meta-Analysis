**BACKGROUND**
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1
(PD-1) that has antitumor activity in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
with increased activity in tumors that express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).

**METHODS**
In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 305 patients who had previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells
and no sensitizing mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene to receive either pembrolizumab (at
a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks) or the investigator’s choice of platinum-based
chemotherapy. Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group
was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic
review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.

**RESULTS**
Median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7
to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2)
in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95%
CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was
80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard
ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P = 0.005). The response rate was higher in
the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the
median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months]
vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any
grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3,
4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%).

**CONCLUSIONS**
In patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells,
pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall
survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.

pproximately 23 to 28% of patients
with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) have a high level of programmed

# A death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, which is de
fined as membranous PD-L1 expression on at
least 50% of tumor cells, regardless of the staining intensity (i.e., a PD-L1 tumor proportion score
of 50% or greater).[1,2] Data from the phase 1
KEYNOTE-001 and phase 3 KEYNOTE-010 studies indicated that patients with advanced NSCLC
and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or
greater were more likely than those with lower
tumor proportion scores to have a response to
pembrolizumab, a highly selective, humanized
monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1
(PD-1) that prevents PD-1 from engaging PD-L1
and PD-L2.[1-3]

Current first-line treatment decisions for advanced NSCLC are based on the presence of genetic aberrations, such as sensitizing mutations
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
translocations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK). However, most patients with NSCLC do
not harbor these oncogenic drivers, and for these
patients, treatment options are limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy. In patients enrolled in the
KEYNOTE-001 trial who had previously untreated
NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of
50% or greater, pembrolizumab (administered
every 2 or 3 weeks at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight) was associated with a response rate of 58.3%, median progression-free
survival of 12.5 months, and 24-month overall
survival of 60.6%.[4]

In the international, randomized, open-label,
phase 3 KEYNOTE-024 trial, we compared
pembrolizumab (administered at a fixed dose of
200 mg every 3 weeks) with the investigator’s
choice of cytotoxic chemotherapy as first-line
therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC and a
PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater.


Methods


**Patients**
Patients 18 years of age or older were eligible for
enrollment if they had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC with no sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK translocations, had
undergone no previous systemic therapy for
metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status


score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher scores indicating
increasing disability), at least one measurable
lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,[5] a life
expectancy of at least 3 months, and a PD-L1
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater. Patients
were ineligible if they were receiving systemic
glucocorticoids (excluding daily glucocorticoidreplacement therapy for conditions such as adrenal or pituitary insufficiency) or other immunosuppressive treatment or if they had untreated
brain metastases, active autoimmune disease for
which they had received systemic treatment during the previous 2 years, active interstitial lung
disease, or a history of pneumonitis for which
they had received glucocorticoids.

**Trial Design and Treatment**
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio,
to receive treatment with either pembrolizumab
(administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg
every 3 weeks) for 35 cycles or the investigator’s
choice of one of the following five platinumbased chemotherapy regimens for 4 to 6 cycles:
carboplatin plus pemetrexed, cisplatin plus pemetrexed, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin
plus gemcitabine, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org).
Chemotherapy regimens that included pemetrexed were permitted only for patients who had
nonsquamous tumors; these patients could continue to receive pemetrexed as maintenance therapy after the completion of combination chemotherapy. The intended chemotherapy regimen,
including the use of pemetrexed maintenance
therapy, was chosen before the patient underwent randomization. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance-status score (0 vs. 1),
tumor histologic type (squamous vs. nonsquamous), and region of enrollment (East Asia vs.
non–East Asia) and did not include any provisions regarding equal distribution of enrollment
across participating sites or stratification by site.
Treatment was continued for the specified number of cycles or until the patient had radiologic
disease progression (defined according to RECIST;
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), had
treatment-related adverse events of unacceptable
severity, or withdrew consent or until the investigator decided to withdraw the patient, which

2 n engl j med nejm org


-----

ever occurred first. Patients in the chemotherapy
group who had disease progression, which was
verified by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review, could cross over to receive
pembrolizumab, if safety criteria were met. There
was no preplanned crossover from the pembrolizumab group to the chemotherapy group, and
there were no guidelines regarding therapy after
disease progression for patients in the pembrolizumab group. Patients in either treatment group
who were in clinically stable condition and were
considered by the investigator to be deriving
clinical benefit could continue therapy after disease progression. Full guidance on treatment
decisions, including the management of adverse
events, can be found in the trial protocol, available at NEJM.org.

**Trial Assessments**
PD-L1 expression was assessed in formalin-fixed
tumor samples at a central laboratory with the
use of the commercially available PD-L1 IHC
22C3 pharmDx assay (Dako North America).[6,7]
Tumor samples were obtained by core-needle or
excisional biopsy or from tissue resected at the
time the metastatic disease was diagnosed. Fineneedle aspirates or samples obtained from irradiated sites or before the administration of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy were not permitted
to be used. Imaging studies of the tumors were
obtained every 9 weeks, and the response to
treatment was assessed according to RECIST by
means of blinded, independent, central radiologic
review. Adverse events were reviewed, a physical
examination was performed, and vital signs, a
complete blood count with a differential count,
and a comprehensive blood panel were assessed
every 3 weeks during treatment and at the time
of treatment discontinuation; T3, free T4, and
thyrotropin were assessed every 6 weeks. During
the survival follow-up phase, patients were contacted every 2 months for an assessment of survival. The full assessment schedule is available
in the trial protocol. All adverse events and abnormalities were graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0.

**End Points**
The primary end point was progression-free survival, which was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death from


any cause. Secondary end points included overall
survival, which was defined as the time from
randomization to death from any cause; objective response rate, which was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete
or partial response; and safety. An exploratory
end point was duration of response, which was
defined as the time from the first documentation of a complete or partial response to disease
progression. A full list of end points is available in the protocol. Efficacy was assessed in
the intention-to-treat population, which included
all patients who underwent randomization. Safety
was assessed in the as-treated population, which
included all patients who received at least one
dose of the assigned trial treatment.

**Trial Oversight**
The KEYNOTE-024 trial was designed by Merck
representatives and academic advisors. Data were
collected by investigators and associated site personnel, analyzed by statisticians employed by
Merck, and interpreted by academic authors and
Merck representatives. An external data and safety
monitoring committee oversaw the trial and
assessed the safety and efficacy at prespecified
interim analyses. Committee members are listed
in the Supplementary Appendix.
The trial protocol and all amendments were
approved by the appropriate institutional review
board or independent ethics committee at each
trial center. The trial was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and
the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All
the patients provided written informed consent
before enrollment.
All the authors had full access to the data,
vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the
data, and attest that the trial was conducted in
accordance with the protocol and all amendments.
The first draft of the manuscript was written by
the first and last authors with input from authors
employed by Merck. All the authors participated
in reviewing and editing the manuscript, and
approved the submitted draft. As part of the site
agreement signed before trial participation,
investigators agreed to keep all aspects of the
trial, including the resultant data, confidential.

**Statistical Analysis**
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate
progression-free and overall survival. For the


n engl j med nejm org 3


-----

analysis of progression-free survival, data for patients who were alive and had no disease progression or who were lost to follow-up were
censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. For the analysis of overall survival, data
for patients who were alive or who were lost to
follow-up were censored at the time of the last
contact. Between-group differences in progressionfree and overall survival were assessed with the
use of a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios
and associated 95% confidence intervals were
assessed with the use of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model with Efron’s method of
handling ties. The same stratification factors
used for randomization were applied to the stratified log-rank and Cox models. Differences in
response rate were assessed with the use of the
stratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen.
The overall type I error rate for this trial was
strictly controlled at a one-sided alpha level of
2.5%. The full statistical analysis plan is available in the protocol. The protocol specified two
interim analyses before the final analysis. The
first interim analysis was to be performed after
the first 191 patients who underwent randomization had a minimum of 6 months of followup; at this time, the objective response rate would
be analyzed at an alpha level of 0.5%. The primary objective of the second interim analysis,
which was to be performed after approximately
175 events of progression or death had been
observed, was to evaluate the superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy with respect to
progression-free survival, at a one-sided alpha
level of 2.0%. If pembrolizumab was superior
with respect to progression-free survival, the superiority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy
with respect to overall survival would be assessed
by means of a group-sequential test with two
analyses, to be performed after approximately
110 and 170 deaths had been observed. We calculated that with approximately 175 events of
progression or death, the trial would have 97%
power to detect a hazard ratio for progression or
death with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy
of 0.55. At the time of the second interim analysis, the trial had approximately 40% power to
detect a hazard ratio for death with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy of approximately
0.65 at a one-sided alpha level of 1.18%.
The second interim analysis was performed


after 189 events of progression or death and 108
deaths had occurred and was based on a cutoff
date of May 9, 2016. The data and safety monitoring committee reviewed the results on June 8,
2016, and June 14, 2016. Because pembrolizu­
mab was superior to chemotherapy with respect
to overall survival at the prespecified multiplicityadjusted, one-sided alpha level of 1.18%, the
external data and safety monitoring committee
recommended that the trial be stopped early to
give the patients who were receiving chemotherapy the opportunity to receive pembrolizu­
mab. All data reported herein are based on the
second interim analysis.


**Patient Characteristics and Treatment**
A total of 1934 patients at 142 sites in 16 countries were screened for enrollment, including
1729 who submitted samples for PD-L1 assessment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Of the 1653 patients whose samples could be
evaluated for PD-L1, 500 (30.2%) had a PD-L1
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater. Between September 19, 2014, and October 29, 2015,
a total of 305 patients at 102 sites who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to either the
pembrolizumab group (154 patients) or the chemotherapy group (151 patients). In the chemotherapy group, the most common regimen was
carboplatin plus pemetrexed (in 67 patients). All
the patients in the pembrolizumab group received the trial treatment. In the chemotherapy
group, 1 patient withdrew consent before receiving the planned trial treatment, and 46 patients
received pemetrexed maintenance therapy after
completion of combination chemotherapy. The
demographic characteristics of the patients and
the disease characteristics at baseline were generally well balanced between treatment groups
(Table 1), although more patients in the chemotherapy group than in the pembrolizumab group
had never smoked (12.6% vs. 3.2%) and more
patients in the pembrolizumab group than in
the chemotherapy group had brain metastases
(11.7% vs. 6.6%). These differences were not
statistically significant.
As of May 9, 2016, the median duration of
follow-up was 11.2 months (range, 6.3 to 19.7),
and 48.1% of the patients in the pembrolizumab

group and 10.0% of the patients in the chemotherapy group were still receiving the assigned
treatment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median duration of treatment was
7.0 months (range, 1 day to 18.7 months) in the
pembrolizumab group and 3.5 months (range,
1 day to 16.8 months) in the chemotherapy group.
The median number of treatment cycles in the
pembrolizumab group was 10.5 (range, 1 to 26);
the median number in the chemotherapy group
was 4 (range, 1 to 6), both for patients who had
squamous tumors and for those who had nonsquamous tumors. In the chemotherapy group,
66 patients (43.7%) crossed over to receive pembrolizumab after disease progression. Of the patients who crossed over, 57.6% were still receiving pembrolizumab at the time of data cutoff.


**Progression-free Survival**
In the intention-to-treat population, on the basis
of 189 total events of progression or death, median progression-free survival was 10.3 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached)
in the pembrolizumab group and 6.0 months
(95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group
(Fig. 1A). The estimated percentage of patients
who were alive and had no disease progression
at 6 months was 62.1% (95% CI, 53.8 to 69.4) in
the pembrolizumab group and 50.3% (95% CI,
41.9 to 58.2) in the chemotherapy group. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in
the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68;
P<0.001). The benefit of pembrolizumab with


n engl j med nejm org 5

-----

respect to progression-free survival was evident
in all subgroups examined (Fig. 1B).

**Overall Survival**
At the time of the second interim analysis, 108
deaths had occurred. The estimated percentage
of patients who were alive at 6 months was
80.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 85.7) in the pembrolizumab group and 72.4% (95% CI, 64.5 to 78.9)
in the chemotherapy group (Fig. 2); median overall survival was not reached in either group.
Overall survival was significantly longer in the
pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy
group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41
to 0.89; P = 0.005).

**Objective Response Rate**
The objective response rate, assessed according
to RECIST, was 44.8% (95% CI, 36.8 to 53.0) in
the pembrolizumab group and 27.8% (95% CI,
20.8 to 35.7) in the chemotherapy group (Table 2).
The median time to response was 2.2 months in
both groups. The median duration of response
was not reached (range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months)
in the pembrolizumab group and was 6.3 months
(range, 2.1+ to 12.6+) in the chemotherapy
group. (Plus signs in the ranges indicate the response was ongoing at cutoff.)

**Adverse Events**
During treatment with the initially assigned therapy, treatment-related adverse events occurred in


73.4% of the patients in the pembrolizumab
group and in 90.0% of the patients in the chemotherapy group (Table 3). Grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred in twice as
many patients in the chemotherapy group as in
the pembrolizumab group (53.3% vs. 26.6%).
Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred
in a similar percentage of patients in the pembrolizumab group and the chemotherapy group
(21.4% and 20.7%, respectively). Discontinuation
of treatment because of treatment-related adverse
events occurred in 7.1% of patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 10.7% of patients in
the chemotherapy group. Treatment-related adverse events that led to death occurred in one
patient in the pembrolizumab group (sudden
death of unknown cause on day 2) and three
patients in the chemotherapy group (one death
due to pulmonary sepsis on day 25, one death
due to pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage on day
112, and one death of unknown cause on day 8).
The most common treatment-related adverse
events were diarrhea (in 14.3% of the patients),

in 9.7% and 0.7% of patients, respectively (Table 3). The only grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated
events that occurred in two or more patients occurred in the pembrolizumab group: severe skin
reactions (in 3.9%), pneumonitis (2.6%), and
colitis (1.3%). There were no grade 5 immunemediated events.


Discussion



- The intention-to-treat population included all patients who underwent randomization. NR denotes not reached.
† Objective response was considered to be a confirmed complete or partial

­response, as assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic
review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1.
The estimated difference between the pembrolizumab group and the chemotherapy group, which was assessed with the use of the stratified method of
Miettinen and Nurminen, was 16.6 percentage points (95% CI, 6.0 to 27.0).
‡ Time to response and duration of response were evaluated in the patients who
had an objective response (69 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 42 in
the chemotherapy group).

fatigue (10.4%), and pyrexia (10.4%) in the pembrolizumab group and anemia (44.0%), nausea
(43.3%), and fatigue (28.7%) in the chemotherapy group (Table 3). Grade 3, 4, or 5 treatmentrelated adverse events that occurred in four or
more patients were diarrhea (in 3.9% of the patients) and pneumonitis (2.6%) in the pembrolizumab group and anemia (19.3%), neutropenia
(13.3%), decreased platelet count (6.0%), thrombocytopenia (5.3%), decreased neutrophil count
(4.0%), fatigue (3.3%), and decreased appetite
(2.7%) in the chemotherapy group. Although decreased neutrophil count and neutropenia may
reflect the same condition, they were listed by
the investigators as two distinct events; this is
also the case for decreased platelet count and
thrombocytopenia.
Immune-mediated adverse events, both those
that were and those that were not attributed by
the investigator to treatment, occurred in 29.2%
of patients in the pembrolizumab group and in
4.7% of patients in the chemotherapy group;
grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated events occurred


The results of this randomized trial showed the
superiority of anti–PD-1 therapy over platinumbased combination chemotherapy as first-line
treatment for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and with
no sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. First-line treatment with pembrolizumab
resulted in significantly longer progression-free
and overall survival than did standard chemotherapy, which included the use of pemetrexed
maintenance therapy for patients with nonsquamous tumors. The magnitude of benefit observed
in the chemotherapy group is consistent with
that previously observed with platinum-based
combination regimens and pemetrexed maintenance therapy.[8-10] The longer progression-free
survival with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy was observed across all subgroups analyzed and thus appeared to occur independently
of patient age, sex, ECOG performance-status
score, tumor histologic type, region of enrollment, presence or absence of brain metastases at
baseline, chemotherapy regimen administered,
and smoking status, although the low number of
patients who had never smoked (24 patients)
precludes accurate interpretation of the benefit
in this population. The benefit of pembrolizu­
mab observed in patients who had squamous
tumors is notable, given the limited treatment
options available for these patients. Pembrolizu­
mab was also associated with a higher objective
response rate, a longer duration of response, and
a lower frequency of treatment-related adverse
events than was chemotherapy.
Pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer overall survival than was chemotherapy, despite the low number of deaths observed and the potentially confounding effect of
crossover from the chemotherapy group to the
pembrolizumab group. On the basis of data
from the second interim analysis, the data and
safety monitoring committee recommended that

the trial be stopped and that patients remaining
in the chemotherapy group be offered pembrolizumab. At the time of data cutoff, 35.4% of the
enrolled patients had died and 43.7% of the patients in the chemotherapy group had crossed
over to receive pembrolizumab. These data underscore the substantial benefit of pembrolizumab
as initial therapy for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1
expression on at least 50% of tumor cells.
All the patients enrolled in this study had a
PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater.
The 50% cutoff was established on the basis of
data from the KEYNOTE-001 trial that showed
a significantly increased objective response rate
in this population.[2] The prevalence of a tumor proportion score of 50% or greater in the
KEYNOTE-024 screened population (30.2%) was
consistent with the prevalence observed in the
KEYNOTE-001 trial among previously untreated
patients (24.9%) and in the KEYNOTE-010 trial
among previously treated patients (28%).[1,2] Ongoing phase 3 studies, such as KEYNOTE-042
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02220894), will
assess the benefit of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy in previously untreated patients who have
a tumor proportion score of 1% or greater.
In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab
was administered at a fixed dose. Pharmacokinetic modeling suggested that a 200-mg fixed
dose of pembrolizumab would provide exposure
similar to the weight-based dosing regimens
used in previous studies of pembrolizumab.[11]
The progression-free survival, overall survival,
objective response rate, and duration of response
observed in the pembrolizumab group in this
trial are consistent with those observed in patients enrolled in the KEYNOTE-001 trial who
had previously untreated NSCLC with a PD-L1
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater and

**References**


who were treated with pembrolizumab at a dose
of 10 mg per kilogram[4]; these results suggest
that 200 mg is an appropriate dose of pembrolizumab for this patient population.
The safety profile of pembrolizumab observed
in this trial was consistent with that seen previously with pembrolizumab for the treatment of
advanced NSCLC[1,2] and other tumor types.[12-16]
The safety profile of chemotherapy was also as
expected. Immune-mediated adverse events (including pneumonitis) occurred more frequently
in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group, whereas cytopenias occurred more
frequently in the chemotherapy group than in the
pembrolizumab group; these results are consistent with the mechanism of action for each
therapy. Most immune-mediated events were of
grade 1 or 2 severity, and none led to death.
However, the overall safety profile appeared to
be better with pembrolizumab than with chemotherapy.
In conclusion, the results of the KEYNOTE-024
trial showed that pembrolizumab was associated
with longer progression-free and overall survival
and fewer treatment-related adverse events than
was platinum-based combination chemotherapy
in patients with previously untreated advanced
NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of
50% or greater.
