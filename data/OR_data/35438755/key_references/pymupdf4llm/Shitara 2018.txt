### Summary
**Background Patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progresses on chemotherapy**
**have poor outcomes. We compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro-**
**oesophageal junction cancer that progressed on first-line chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine.**

**Methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at 148 medical centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients**
**were randomised (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response**
**system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or standard-dose paclitaxel. Primary**
**endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with a programmed cell death ligand 1**
**(PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or higher. Safety was assessed in all patients, irrespective of CPS. The**
**significance threshold for overall survival was p=0·0135 (one-sided). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov,**
**number NCT02370498.**

**Findings Between June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled. Of the 395 patients who had a PD-L1 CPS**
**of 1 or higher, 196 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab and 199 patients were assigned to receive paclitaxel.**
**As of Oct 26, 2017, 326 patients in the population with CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 196 patients in the**
**pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Median overall survival was 9·1 months**
**(95% CI 6·2–10·7) with pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6–9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI**
**0·66–1·03; one-sided p=0·0421). Median progression-free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4–2·0) with pembrolizumab**
**and 4·1 months (3·1–4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03–1·57). In the total population, grade 3–5 treatment-**
**related adverse events occurred in 42 (14%) of the 294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 96 (35%) of the**
**276 patients treated with paclitaxel.**

**Interpretation Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel as second-line**
**therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Pembrolizumab**
**had a better safety profile than paclitaxel. Additional trials of pembrolizumab in gastric and gastro-oesophageal**
**cancer are ongoing.**

### Introduction
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and is
the third most common cause of cancer mortality
worldwide.[1] Chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoro­
pyrimidine is the recommended first-line therapy for
patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro­
oesophageal junction cancer who have good performance
status; patients who have human epidermal growth
factor 2 (HER2)-positive tumours should also receive
trastuzumab.[2–6] In the second-line setting, treatment
options include cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel,
paclitaxel, or irinotecan and the vascular endothelial
growth factor 2 (VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody


ramucirumab given as either monotherapy or in
combination with paclitaxel.
In recent years, immunotherapy with immune
checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of
advanced cancer. One such checkpoint is programmed
death 1 (PD-1), which is a negative costimulatory receptor
expressed mainly on activated T cells.[7] In tumour cells,
inhibition of PD-1 prevents PD-1 from binding to its
ligands, PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2),
thus restoring antitumour immunity. Overexpression of
PD-L1 has been observed in gastric cancer,[8] making PD-1
pathway inhibition a rational target in patients with
gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
We searched PubMed on Feb 10, 2018, with the terms “PD-1 OR
PD-L1 OR MK-3475 OR pembrolizumab OR Keytruda OR
BMS-936558 OR nivolumab OR Opdivo OR MPDL3280A OR
atezolizumab OR Tecentriq OR MEDI4736 OR durvalumab OR
Imfinzi OR MSB0010718C OR avelumab OR Bavencio” AND
“gastric cancer OR gastroesophageal junction cancer.” No limits
were applied to the search. We also searched the abstracts from
the 2017 and 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology
Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, the 2016 and 2017
American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, the
2016 and 2017 World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancer, and
the 2016 and 2017 European Society for Medical Oncology
Congress using the same terms to identify results of any clinical
trials that were not yet published in the peer-reviewed scientific
literature. We identified one randomised phase 3 trial of
anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy for advanced gastric or gastrooesophageal junction cancer, the ATTRACTION-2 study of
nivolumab versus placebo as third-line or later therapy. We also
identified phase 1 and phase 2 studies of anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy for advanced gastric or gastrooesophageal junction cancer (KEYNOTE-012 and KEYNOTE-059
studies of pembrolizumab and the JAVELIN study of avelumab).
In three additional phase 1 and phase 2 studies of anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 combination therapy, pembrolizumab was tested in
combination with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine
(KEYNOTE-059), ramucirumab (JVDF), or margetuximab,
nivolumab was tested in combination with ipilimumab
(CheckMate 032), and durvalumab was tested in combination
with ramucirumab. We focused on the studies of anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy.

**Added value of this study**
This is the first report of data from a randomised trial of
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy as second-line therapy for


advanced gastric cancer and the first report of data from a
randomised trial of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy to include
an active comparator. Although the prespecified boundary for
detecting a statistically significant improvement in overall
survival with pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel in patients with
PD-L1-expressing tumours was not reached, the results of the
protocol-specified exploratory subgroup analysis suggest that
pembrolizumab might have antitumour activity in patients
with a good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status. Data from post-hoc analyses suggest that
pembrolizumab also has antitumour activity in patients whose
tumours had higher levels of PD-L1 expression or high levels of
microsatellite instability. The findings show that
pembrolizumab has a favourable safety profile compared with
paclitaxel, with patients treated with pembrolizumab having
fewer adverse events attributed to study treatment that were
high-grade or led to treatment discontinuation.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies appear to have antitumour
activity in select patients with advanced gastric or gastrooesophageal cancer, as well as a favourable safety profile. The
greatest relative benefit for these therapies, when given as
monotherapy, might be in the setting of third-line therapy and
beyond in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or
higher (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) and
as second-line therapy in patients with good performance
status or patients whose tumours show high levels of
microsatellite instability or higher levels of PD-L1 expression.
These hypothesis-generating results suggest that prospective,
controlled assessments of these subgroups are of value. Data
from phase 1 and phase 2 studies suggest that combination
regimens that include anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies are
worthy of further assessment, particularly in early lines of
therapy for advanced disease or earlier stages of disease.


Pembrolizumab is a humanised, high-affinity, IgG4-κ
monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1, preventing the
interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 and PD-L2. In the phase
2 KEYNOTE-059 study,[9] pembrolizumab had antitumour
activity and a manageable safety profile in patients
with previously treated gastric cancer who received
pembrolizumab monotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg
on day 1 of each 3-week cycle. Patients with advanced
gastric cancer that progressed on two or more lines of
previous therapy had a response rate of 11·6%; the
response rate in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive
score (CPS) of 1 or more was 15·5% in those who
received pembrolizumab as third-line or later therapy
and 22·7% in those who received pembrolizumab as
third-line therapy. On the basis of the observed response
rate and the durability of response, the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval


of pembrolizumab for the treatment of recurrent locally
advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro-oesophageal
junction adenocarcinoma that expresses PD-L1 (CPS ≥1)
and progressed on or after two or more previous
lines of therapy including platinum-containing and
fluoro­pyrimidine-containing chemotherapy and, if
appropriate, HER2/neu-targeted therapy.
Here we present results of the KEYNOTE-061 study of
pembrolizumab compared with paclitaxel as second-line
therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at
148 medical centres in 30 countries (Argentina, Australia,
Belgium Canada Chile Colombia Denmark Estonia


-----

Finland, Germany, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Ireland,
Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Norway, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa,
South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, and USA). An
open-label design was chosen because the different
pembrolizumab and paclitaxel administration schedules
would make it difficult to do a masked study. Eligible
patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically or
cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach
or gastro-oesophageal junction that was metastatic or
locally advanced but unresectable, had progression as per
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1
(RECIST v1.1)[10] after first-line therapy with a platinum
and fluoropyrimidine, as well as with trastuzumab in
patients with HER2-positive tumours, had an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status of 0 or 1, and had provided a tumour sample for
PD-L1 assessment. Initially, patients were enrolled
irrespective of PD-L1 expression status. After 489 patients
were enrolled, the independent data monitoring com­
mittee recommended that enrolment be restricted to
patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher on the basis of
outcomes in patients with a CPS less than 1. Exclusion
criteria included squamous-cell or un­differentiated
histology, previous therapy with any PD-1, PD-L1, or
PD-L2 inhibitor, and active autoimmune disease that
necessitated systemic treatment. A complete list of
inclusion and exclusion criteria is included in the
appendix.
The study protocol and all amendments were approved
by the institutional review board or ethics committee at
each institution. The study was done in accordance with
the protocol and its amendments and Good Clinical
Practice guidelines. All patients provided written
informed consent before enrolment.

#### Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) using a central
interactive voice-response and integrated web-response
system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously
every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m² intravenously on
days 1, 8, and 15 of 4-week cycles. The allocation schedule
was generated by the system vendor using a computerised
random list generator. Enrolment of the first 125 patients
was stratified by geographical region (Europe, Israel,
North America, and Australia vs Asia vs rest of world) and
ECOG performance status (0 _vs 1). Following a protocol_
amendment, enrolment of the remaining 467 patients
was stratified by geographical region (Europe, Israel,
North America, and Australia vs Asia vs rest of the world),
time to progression on first-line therapy (<6 months _vs_
≥6 months), and PD-L1 CPS (<1 vs ≥1). The stratification
factors were changed because time to progression on
first-line therapy and PD-L1 expression status are
predictive of response in second-line gastric cancer
treatment and therefore might affect overall survival.
Treatment was allocated in blocks of four in each stratum


Patients, treating doctors, the external data monitoring
committee, and sponsor representatives were not masked
to treatment assignment. The central radiological
reviewers were masked to treatment assignment.

#### Procedures
Premedication with an oral corticosteroid, an anti­
histamine, cimetidine, and an antiemetic according to
local guidelines was recommended in the paclitaxel
group. Treatment was continued for 35 cycles (roughly
2 years; pembrolizumab only) or until disease pro­
gression, intolerable toxicity, doctor decision, or patient
withdrawal of consent. Patients with radiological disease
progression who were clinically stable could continue
study treatment until progression was confirmed on a
scan obtained at least 4 weeks later. Patients who achieved
confirmed complete response could discontinue treat­
ment if they received treatment for at least 24 weeks and
received at least two doses of treatment beyond the time
complete response was initially declared. Patients in the
paclitaxel group were not permitted to cross over to
receive pembrolizumab.
Radiographic imaging was done every 6 weeks.
Response was assessed per RECIST v1.1[10] by masked and
independent central review. Adverse events were
collected throughout treatment and for 30 days thereafter
(90 days for serious adverse events and events of special
interest to pembrolizumab) and graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events version 4.0. PD-L1 expression was
assessed in archival or newly collected tumour samples
at a central laboratory using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3
pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies; Carpinteria, CA,
USA) and measured using the CPS, defined as the
number of PD-L1–positive cells (tumour cells, lympho­
cytes, macrophages) as a proportion of the total number
of tumour cells multiplied by 100. DNA mismatch repair
in five mononucleotide repeat markers (NR21, _NR24,_
_BAT25,_ _BAT26,_ _MONO27) was assessed using DNA_
extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
tumour samples and blood (normal control) using the
MSI Analysis System version 1.2 (Promega; Madison,
WI, USA). Tumours with high levels of microsatellite
instability were those for which two or more markers
were changed compared with normal controls.

#### Outcomes
Primary endpoints were overall survival, defined as
the time from randomisation to death from any cause,
and progression-free survival, defined as the time
from randomisation to radiological disease progression
(assessed per RECIST v1.1 by masked and independent
central review) or death from any cause, in patients with
a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Secondary efficacy endpoints
included: response rate, defined as the proportion of
patients with complete or partial response, and duration
of response defined as the time from first documented

complete or partial response to radiological disease
progression or death due to any cause (both assessed per
RECIST v1.1 by masked and independent central review
and by investigator assessment) in patients with a PD-L1
CPS of 1 or higher and in the total population;
progression-free survival (assessed per RECIST v1.1 by
masked and independent central review) and overall
survival in the total population; progression-free survival
(assessed per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment
and per irRECIST by masked and independent central
review) in the population with CPS of 1 or higher and in


the total population; and time to progression, defined as
the time from randomisation to radiological disease
progression (assessed per RECIST v1.1 by masked and
independent central review and by investigator
assessment) in the population with CPS of 1 or higher
and in the total population. Safety in all patients,
irrespective of CPS, was also a secondary endpoint and
was assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters,
including adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs.

#### Statistical analysis
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and response
rate were analysed in the intention-to-treat population,
defined as all patients who were randomly allocated to
treatment, irrespective of whether they received the
treatment. Duration of response was analysed in all
patients who had a best response of complete or partial
response. Safety was assessed in all patients who received
at least one dose of study treatment.
The protocol specified one interim analysis and a final
analysis. After reviewing the results of the interim
analysis of overall survival, which was done by an
unmasked statistician and was the primary analysis of
progression-free survival, the external data monitoring
committee recommended the study continue as planned.
From inception, the study was designed to show a
difference in overall survival or progression-free survival
in patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. The final
analysis was planned for when at least 290 deaths
occurred in patients with a CPS of 1 or higher or about
15 months after the last patient was randomised,
whichever occurred later. Assuming overall survival
follows an exponential distribution with a median of
7·5 months in the paclitaxel group (based on data from
the RAINBOW trial[11]), an enrolment period of 14 months,
a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·67 between pembrolizumab and
paclitaxel, and an annual dropout rate of 2%, we calculated
that 360 patients with a CPS of 1 or higher would have to
be enrolled to provide 91% power to detect an HR of 0·67
for overall survival at a one-sided α value of 0·0215. The
Hwang-Shih-DeCani alpha-spending function with the
gamma parameter of –4 was used to construct the actual
boundaries at the final analysis on the basis of the actual
α spent at the interim analysis and the number of events
recorded at the interim and final analyses. The familywise type I error rate was strictly controlled at a one-sided
α of 2·50%, with 0·35% allocated to the hypothesis of
progression-free survival and 2·15% allocated to the
hypothesis of overall survival (appendix); superiority of
pembrolizumab was only required for one of the primary
endpoints to conclude a significant treatment effect for
pembroli­zumab. With 326 deaths observed in the
population of patients with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher at
the time of final analysis, the significance threshold for
overall survival was p=0·0135 (one-sided).
For overall survival, data for patients who were alive or
lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last


-----

confirmed contact. For progression-free survival, data for
patients without disease progression or who were lost to
follow-up were censored at the time of last tumour
assessment. For duration of response, data for patients
who were alive with ongoing response at the time of
analysis or who discontinued the study without radio­
graphic evidence of progression were censored at the
time of the last radiographic assessment showing
response. For both progression-free survival and duration
of response, data for patients who started new anticancer
therapy without radiographic evidence of progression
were censored at the time of the last tumour assessment
before new anticancer therapy was initiated.
SAS version 9.4 was used for all statistical analyses.
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration
of response were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Treatment differences in overall and progressionfree survival were assessed using the log-rank test
stratified by the randomisation stratification factors.
HRs and their associated 95% CIs were calculated using
stratified Cox proportional hazards models with Efron’s
method of tie handling. In a post-hoc analysis designed to
account for the non-proportional hazards effect associated
with the overall survival curves for immunotherapy, the
treatment difference in overall survival was assessed
using the weighted log-rank test from the FlemingHarrington G(ρ–γ) family with ρ value of 1 and γ value
of 1,[12] such that events that occurred at middle timepoints
were weighted more heavily than early and late events,
with stratification by geographical region and time to
progression on first-line therapy. The response rate was
compared between treatment groups using the Miettinen
and Nurminen method.
This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
NCT02370498.

#### Role of the funding source
The funder participated in study design, data analysis
and interpretation, and manuscript writing. The funder
maintained the study database. All authors had full
access to the data and had final responsibility for the
decision to submit for publication.

### Results
983 patients were screened for enrolment between
June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016. 593 patients met all
eligibility criteria; one patient withdrew consent, and the
remaining 592 patients were randomly assigned to
pembrolizumab (n=296) or paclitaxel (n=296); at least one
dose of treatment was received by 294 patients in the
pembrolizumab group and 276 patients in the paclitaxel
group (figure 1). 395 randomly allocated patients had a
PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher (196 patients in the
pembrolizumab group and 199 patients in the paclitaxel
group); of these, 194 patients in the pembrolizumab group
and 188 patients in the paclitaxel received at least one dose
of treatment In the total population 136 (46%) of


-----

296 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 171 (58%) of
296 patients in the paclitaxel group received at least one
subsequent therapy. The most common subsequent
therapies in the pembrolizumab group were paclitaxel
(96 [32%] of 296 patients), irinotecan hydrochloride
(60 [20%]), and ramucirumab (47 [16%]); no patients
received subsequent immunotherapy. The most common
subsequent therapies in the paclitaxel group were
irinotecan (108 [36%] of 296 patients), fluorouracil

(47 [16%]), and ramucirumab (47 [16%]); 30 (10%) of
296 patients received subsequent immunotherapy.
As of Oct 26, 2017 (data cutoff date), median follow-up
was 7·9 months (IQR 3·4–14·6) in the total population
and 8·5 months (3·7–15·7) in the population with a
PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. No patients remained on
paclitaxel, whereas 15 (5%) of 296 patients in the
pembrolizumab group, including 13 (7%) of 196 patients
with a CPS of 1 or higher, remained on pembrolizumab
(figure 1). Additionally, eight (3%) of 296 patients in the
pembrolizumab group completed study treatment,
including seven (4%) of 196 patients with a PD-L1 CPS of
1 or higher.
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics
were as expected and were generally balanced between
groups in the total population and the population with a
PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher (table 1). Most patients were
male, had gastric adenocarcinoma, had HER2-negative
tumours, and had disease progression within 6 months
of first-line therapy.
At the time of data cutoff, 326 patients in the population
with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of
196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of
199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Pembrolizumab
did not significantly prolong overall survival (HR 0·82,
95% CI 0·66–1·03; one-sided p=0·0421). Median overall
survival was 9·1 months (95% CI 6·2–10·7) for
pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (95% CI 7·6–9·0) for
paclitaxel (figure 2). The estimated proportion of patients
surviving at 12 months was 40% (95% CI 33–47) with
pembroli­zumab and 27% (21–33) with paclitaxel;
proportions at 18 months were 26% (95% CI 20–32) and
15% (10–20), respectively. In a post-hoc analysis of the
treatment difference in overall survival using the weighted
log-rank test, the one-sided p-value was 0·0009.
The treatment effect for pembrolizumab versus
paclitaxel was mostly similar across subgroups of the
population with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher, with overlapping
CIs in all subgroups (figure 2). Among these protocolspecified subgroups, the pembrolizumab treatment effect
was greater in patients with an ECOG performance status
of 0 and in patients with a primary tumour in the gastrooesophageal junction. Median overall survival in patients
with an ECOG performance status of 0 was 12·3 months
(95% CI 9·7–15·9) with pembrolizumab versus
9·3 months (8·3–10·5) with paclitaxel (HR 0·69, 95% CI
0·49–0·97; figure 3A); median overall survival in patients
with an ECOG performance status of 1 was 5·4 months
(95% CI 3·7–7·7) with pembrolizumab versus 7·5 months
(95% CI 5·3–8·4) with paclitaxel (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·73–
1·32; figure 3B). In post-hoc analysis, the pembrolizumab
treatment effect was greater for patients with a PD-L1 CPS
of 10 or higher (HR 0·64, 95% CI 0·41–1·02; median
overall survival 10·4 months [95% CI 5·9–17·3] with
pembrolizumab vs 8·0 months [5·1–9·9] with paclitaxel;
figure 3C) and for patients whose tumours had high levels
of microsatellite instability irrespective of the CPS


-----

(HR 0·42, 95% CI 0·13–1·31; median overall survival not
reached [95% CI 5·6 months–not reached] vs 8·1 months

[2·0–16·7]; appendix). In the protocol-specified subgroup
with a PD-L1 CPS less than 1, the HR was 1·20 (95% CI
0·89–1·63), and median overall survival was 4·8 months
(95% CI 3·9–6·1) with pembrolizumab versus 8·2 months
(6·8–10·6) with paclitaxel (appendix).
In the population with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher,
361 patients had disease progression or died, including
177 (90%) of 196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and
184 (94%) of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group. The HR
for progression-free survival for pembrolizumab versus
paclitaxel was 1·27 (95% CI 1·03–1·57; figure 4). Median
progression-free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI
1·4–2·0) for pembrolizumab and 4·1 months (3·1–4·2)
for paclitaxel. The estimated proportion of patients alive
and without disease progression at 12 months was 14%
(95% CI 9–19) and 9% (5–14), respectively. The HR for
progression-free survival in the protocol-specified
population with PD-L1 CPS less than 1 was 2·05 (95% CI
1·50–2·79; appendix).
In the population of patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or
higher, confirmed responses were observed in 31 of
196 patients in the pembrolizumab group (response rate
16%, 95% CI 11–22) and in 27 of 199 patients in the
paclitaxel group (response rate 14%, 95% CI 9–19);
complete responses were observed in seven (4%) of
196 patients in the pembroli­zumab group and five (3%) of
199 patients in the paclitaxel group. Responses were more
durable in the pembroli­zumab group than in the paclitaxel
group, with a median response duration of 18·0 months
(95% CI 8·3–not estimable) versus 5·2 months (3·2–15·3;
appendix). Response rates in the subgroups with PD-L1
CPS less than 1 and CPS of 10 or higher and in ECOG
performance status subgroups of the population with a
PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher are shown in the appendix. In a
post-hoc analysis of patients whose tumours had high
levels of microsatellite instability, irrespective of CPS,
responses were observed in seven (47%) of 15 patients in
the pembrolizumab group and in two (17%) of 12 patients
in the paclitaxel group.
Similar to the findings for progression-free and overall
survival, pembrolizumab did not prolong time to
progression compared with paclitaxel (appendix). As
expected, the treatment effect for pembrolizumab for
overall survival was less in the total population than in
the population with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher; similarly,

preferred terms listed, related terms were also included.

**_Table 2: Adverse events in the overall as-treated population_**

the HRs for progression-free survival and time to
progression in the total population were higher than
those in the population with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher
(appendix) Although the response rate was lower for


pembrolizumab in the total population, the duration of
response was the same as that observed in the population
with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher (appendix). Outcomes
for progression-free survival, time to progression, and
response rate based on RECIST v1.1 by investigator
assessment were generally similar to assessment by
masked and independent central review (appendix).
Of 570 patients who received at least one dose of study
treatment, irrespective of PD-L1 CPS, the mean treatment
duration was 4·4 months (SD 6·1) in the 294 patients who
received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and
3·5 months (3·4) in the 276 patients who received at least
one dose of paclitaxel. Adverse events attributed to study
treatment by the investigator occurred in 155 (53%) of
294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 232 (84%)
of 276 patients treated with paclitaxel (table 2). These
events were of grade 3–5 severity in 42 (14%) of 294 patients
in the pembrolizumab group and 96 (35%) of 276 patients
in the paclitaxel group and led to discontinuation of study
treatment in nine (3%) patients and 15 (5%) patients,
respectively. Deaths attributed to study treatment occurred
in three (1%) of 294 patients in the pembrolizumab group
(colitis, interstitial lung disease, and death in one patient
each) and in one (<1%) of 276 patients in the paclitaxel
group (pulmonary embolism).
Adverse event profiles were as expected for pembroli­
zumab and paclitaxel (table 2). The most common
grade 3–5 adverse events attributed to study treatment
were anaemia (seven [2%] of 294 patients) and fatigue
(seven [2%]) in the pembrolizumab group and decreased
neutrophil count (28 [10%] of 276 patients) and
neutropenia (20 [7%]) in the paclitaxel group. Adverse
events of interest to pembrolizumab based on their likely
immune aetiology, irrespective of attribution to study
treatment, occurred in 54 (18%) of 294 patients treated
with pembrolizumab and 21 (8%) of 276 patients treated
with paclitaxel (table 2). The only adverse events of interest
of grade 3–5 severity that occurred in two or more patients
in the pembrolizumab group were hepatitis (four [1%] of
294 patients), hypophysitis (two [<1%]), and pneumonitis
(two [<1%]).

### Discussion
In this randomised, open-label, phase 3 study, pembroli­
zumab did not significantly improve overall survival
compared with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric
or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with a PD-L1 CPS
of 1 or higher that progressed after one line of chemo­
therapy containing a platinum and fluoropyrimidine. The
overall survival curve for the pembrolizumab group
appeared to plateau at about 20 months, supporting a
long-term benefit for pembrolizumab in some patients.
There was no improvement in progression-free survival
or response rate; however, pembrolizumab responses
were more durable than paclitaxel responses. The lack of a
progression-free survival benefit with pembrolizumab is
consistent with findings from other studies of second-line


-----

PD-1 inhibition in advanced cancers, including the
KEYNOTE-045 study[13] of pembrolizumab versus
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy for previously
treated advanced urothelial cancer. The safety profile of
pembrolizumab was consistent with that previously
observed for pembrolizumab in patients with advanced
solid tumours and was better overall than that of paclitaxel,
with a lower frequency of treatment-related adverse events
of any grade, of grade 3 or worse severity, and that led to
treatment discontinuation.
The median overall survival in the paclitaxel group
was generally consistent with that previously observed
for paclitaxel given as second-line therapy for advanced
gastric cancer.[11,14] Although the combination of ramuci­
rumab and paclitaxel significantly improved overall
survival compared with paclitaxel alone in the secondline advanced gastric cancer setting[11] and is currently
the global standard-of-care second-line therapy for
patients with advanced gastric cancer and a good
performance status, this was not the case when
KEYNOTE-061 was designed in late 2014. We therefore
chose paclitaxel monotherapy for our control group. We
acknowledge that future studies of second-line therapy
should use ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination
therapy as the comparator.
Protocol-specified subgroup analysis in the primary
population of patients with a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher
showed that patients with an ECOG performance status
of 0 had a greater relative treatment effect with
pembrolizumab compared with patients who had a
performance status of 1, as did patients with a primary
tumour location of the gastro-oesophageal junction
compared with the stomach. Better ECOG performance
status was also associated with a higher response rate
and longer overall survival with pembrolizumab in
KEYNOTE-059.[9] The prognostic effect of performance
status in KEYNOTE-061 appeared to be more pronounced
in the pembrolizumab group than in the paclitaxel group.
Further analysis is necessary to determine why the
prognostic effect differs between treatment groups.
Combination therapy with pembrolizumab and cytotoxic
chemotherapy could help overcome the delayed response
of pembrolizumab and the less durable responses of
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Data from a small phase 1 cohort
of KEYNOTE-059 suggest that pembro­lizumab combined
with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine has a
manageable safety profile and promising antitumour
activity in patients with previously untreated advanced
gastric or gastro-oesophageal cancer.[15] In the ongoing
phase 3 KEYNOTE-062 study (NCT02494583), the efficacy
and safety of this combination is being compared with
those of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine and
those of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with
previously untreated advanced gastric or gastrooesophageal cancer.
Consistent with results of KEYNOTE-059[9] and study
findings for pembrolizumab in other tumour types [16–18]


a relationship between greater PD-L1 expression and a
greater treatment effect for pembrolizumab was found in
KEYNOTE-061. These data reinforce the utility of PD-L1
expression for selecting patients for treatment with
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Of note, data from the
Asian ATTRACTION-2 study, in which the anti-PD-1
mono­clonal antibody nivolumab was compared with
placebo in patients with advanced gastric cancer whose
disease progressed after two or more previous chemo­
therapy regimens, showed a significant benefit for
nivolumab in all patients, including those with PD-L1negative tumours.[19] However, PD-L1 expression in
ATTRACTION-2 was assessed retrospectively on tumour
cells using the 28-8 pharmDx assay, with PD-L1 expression
available for only 39% of patients. In KEYNOTE-061,
PD-L1 expression was prospectively assessed on tumour
cells and tumour-associated lymphocytes and macro­
phages using the 22C3 pharmDx assay, which might be a
better predictor of outcomes than tumour PD-L1
expression alone.
Defects in mismatch repair result in tumours that have
an increased number of somatic mutations, which could
induce an innate antitumour immune response and
render tumours more responsive to immune checkpoint
blockade.[20] On the basis of data from phase 1 and phase 2
studies,[21–23] in which levels of microsatellite instability were
assessed locally using PCR or immuno­histochemistry,
pembrolizumab was approved in the USA for the
treatment of patients with previously treated advanced
solid tumours of any type that have a high level of
microsatellite instability. In a post-hoc exploratory analysis
of this study, patients whose tumours had high levels of
microsatellite instability (as assessed retrospectively at a
central laboratory by PCR and irrespective of PD-L1 CPS)
had a particularly large treatment effect with pembroli­
zumab. These findings confirm the use of mismatch
repair deficiency and microsatellite instability as predictive
biomarkers for pembrolizumab. Analyses of other
biomarkers that might predict response to pembrolizumab,
including the presence of Epstein-Barr virus RNA,[8,24] are
ongoing.
Examination of the Kaplan-Meier curve for overall
survival in the primary population of patients with a
PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher showed that for about the first
8 months after randomisation, the paclitaxel group
outperformed the pembrolizumab group. At 8 months,
the survival curves crossed. After this divergence, the
separation in favour of pembrolizumab was sustained,
probably because of the greater durability of benefit
in those patients who had response or prolonged stable
disease. The crossing of survival curves has been
observed in studies of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in other
tumour types[13,25–27] and might reflect the time it takes to
induce an effective antitumour immune response. The
delayed onset of benefit for immunotherapy and the
violation of the proportional hazards assumption
highlight the need for alternative statistical methods to


-----

accurately assess the benefit of these therapies.[28]
One alternative is to use the weighted log-rank test. A
post-hoc analysis of the treatment difference between
pembrolizumab and paclitaxel using the weighted logrank test, such that more weight was placed on the events
that occurred around the middle of the follow-up
duration (ie, around the time at which the overall survival
curves crossed) and less weight on events that occurred
early or late, resulted in a one-sided p-value of 0·0009.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published
report of findings from a global, randomised, activecontrolled trial of an immune checkpoint inhibitor in
advanced gastric cancer. The other published report of a
randomised study of a checkpoint inhibitor for advanced
gastric cancer was the aforementioned ATTRACTION-2
study of nivolumab versus placebo in patients from
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan whose disease progressed
after two or more prior chemotherapy regimens.[19]

A limitation of this study is the open-label design,
which led to the larger number of patients who were
randomised but did not receive study treatment in the
paclitaxel group than in the pembrolizumab group. These
patients probably went on to receive other therapies,
which could have affected the results in the paclitaxel
group and thus the relative benefit of pembrolizumab
versus paclitaxel. Although the treatment groups
appeared well balanced, the exclusion of patients with a
PD-L1 CPS less than 1 after 83% of patients were enrolled
and the change in stratification factors after 21% of
patients were enrolled might have introduced bias that
affected the results.
Our data show that pembrolizumab monotherapy did
not significantly improve overall survival compared with
paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer with
a PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher that progressed on firstline chemotherapy containing a platinum and fluoro­
pyrimidine. However, a benefit from pembrolizumab
emerged with long-term follow-up, with clinically
meaningful 12-month and 18-month survival estimates
of about 40% and 26%, respectively. Protocol-specified
and post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that
the treatment effect of pembrolizumab might be more
pronounced in patients with a better performance status,
greater levels of PD-L1 expression, and tumours with
high levels of microsatellite instability. Along with the
favourable safety profile, these data support further
exploration to identify patients who are likely to benefit
from pembrolizumab monotherapy and the ongoing
development of pembrolizumab as part of combination
therapy regimens.
