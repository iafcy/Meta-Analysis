**BACKGROUND**
First-line therapy for advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that lacks
targetable mutations is platinum-based chemotherapy. Among patients with a tumor
proportion score for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) of 50% or greater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of choice.
The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly higher
rates of response and longer progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone in
a phase 2 trial.

**METHODS**
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) 616 patients
with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations who
had received no previous treatment for metastatic disease to receive pemetrexed
and a platinum-based drug plus either 200 mg of pembrolizumab or placebo every
3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to a total of
35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab monotherapy was permitted among the patients in the placebo-combination group who
had verified disease progression. The primary end points were overall survival and
progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review.

**RESULTS**
After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the estimated rate of overall survival at
12 months was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembrolizumab-combination group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in the placebocombination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001).
Improvement in overall survival was seen across all PD-L1 categories that were
evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) in the
placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52;
95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2%
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 65.8% of those in
the placebo-combination group.

**CONCLUSIONS**
In patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without
_EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy_
of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantly longer overall
survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by Merck;

nhibitors of programmed death 1 (PD-1)
and its ligand PD-L1 are effective therapies for
metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

# Ilacking sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations. Pem
brolizumab (Keytruda, Merck), nivolumab (Opdivo,
Bristol-Myers Squibb), and atezolizumab (Tecentriq, Genentech) are approved as second-line therapy. Among patients in whom the percentage of
tumor cells with membranous PD-L1 staining
(tumor proportion score) is 50% or greater, pembrolizumab has replaced cytotoxic chemotherapy
as the first-line treatment of choice. However, patients with a tumor proportion score of 50% or
greater represent a minority of those with NSCLC.
Because patients with advanced NSCLC can undergo rapid clinical deterioration during disease
progression, less than one half of patients with
advanced NSCLC ever receive second-line therapy.[1,2]
First-line combination regimens that include a
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor may maximize the chance
of response and lead to prolonged survival. Modulation of the immune response through PD-1 inhibition may be enhanced by the potential immunogenic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as
increasing the potential for antigen cross-presentation by dendritic cells after the destruction of
tumor cells,[3] inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells,[4] increasing the ratio of cytotoxic lymphocytes to regulatory T cells,[5] and blocking the
STAT6 pathway to enhance dendritic-cell activity.[6]

A randomized, phase 2 trial of carboplatin plus
pemetrexed (Alimta, Eli Lilly) with or without
pembrolizumab showed significantly better rates
of response and longer progression-free survival
with the addition of pembrolizumab than with
chemotherapy alone.[7] In the global, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 trial,
we compared the combination of pemetrexed and
a platinum-based drug plus either pembrolizumab
or placebo in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC
with any level of PD-L1 expression.


Methods


**Patients**
Patients who were at least 18 years of age were
eligible for enrollment if they had pathologically
confirmed metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations; had received no previous systemic therapy for metastatic
disease; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 0 or


1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating increasing disability)[8]; had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version
1.1[9]; and had provided a tumor sample for determination of PD-L1 status. Patients were excluded
if they had symptomatic central nervous system
metastases, had a history of noninfectious pneumonitis that required the use of glucocorticoids,
had active autoimmune disease, or were receiving systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Because of an increased risk of pneumonitis,[10] patients were also excluded if they had received
more than 30 Gy of radiotherapy to the lung in
the previous 6 months. Full eligibility criteria are
listed in the trial protocol, available with the full
text of this article at NEJM.org.

**Trial Design and Treatment**
In this double-blind trial, patients were randomly
assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either 200 mg of
pembrolizumab or saline placebo, both administered intravenously every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Randomization was performed by means of
an integrated interactive voice-response and Webresponse system (i.e., treatment assignments could
be provided by following a series of prompts on
a touch-tone phone or by following the same
prompts in a Web-based portal). Randomization
was stratified according to PD-L1 expression
(tumor proportion score, ≥1% vs. <1%), choice of
platinum-based drug (cisplatin vs. carboplatin),
and smoking history (never vs. former or current).
All the patients received four cycles of the
investigator’s choice of intravenously administered cisplatin (75 mg per square meter of bodysurface area) or carboplatin (area under the concentration–time curve, 5 mg per milliliter per
minute) plus pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter), all administered intravenously every 3 weeks,
followed by pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter)
every 3 weeks. All the patients received premedication with folic acid, vitamin B12, and glucocorticoids administered according to local guidelines
for pemetrexed use.
Treatment was continued until radiographic
progression, unacceptable toxic effects, investigator decision, or patient withdrawal of consent. If
toxicity was clearly attributed to one agent, that
drug alone could be discontinued. Patients in the
placebo-combination group in whom disease progression was verified by blinded, independent

central radiologic review were eligible to cross over
to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy. Additional details regarding treatment decisions, including the management of adverse events, are
provided in the protocol.

**Assessments**
PD-L1 expression was assessed during screening
at a central laboratory by means of the PD-L1 IHC
22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent) in formalin-fixed
tumor samples obtained by core-needle or excisional biopsy from tissue resected at the time that
metastatic disease was diagnosed. Expression was
categorized according to the tumor proportion
score (i.e., the percentage of tumor cells with
membranous PD-L1 staining).[11] Investigators, patients, and representatives of the sponsor were
unaware of the patients’ tumor proportion scores.
Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were
graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,
version 4.0. Tumor imaging was scheduled for
weeks 6 and 12, then every 9 weeks through
week 48 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response
was assessed according to RECIST, version 1.1.[9]
Patients were contacted every 12 weeks to assess
survival during follow-up.

**End Points**
The two primary end points were overall survival
(time from randomization to death from any cause)
and progression-free survival (time from randomization to disease progression, as assessed by
blinded, independent central radiologic review, or
death from any cause, whichever occurred first).
The secondary end points were the response rate
(the percentage of patients with a confirmed complete or partial response), the duration of response
(time from first documented complete or partial
response to disease progression or death), and
safety. Both the response rate and the duration of
response were assessed by blinded, independent
central radiologic review. Exploratory end points
included the effect of PD-L1 expression on efficacy and patient-reported outcomes. The full list
of end points and the statistical analysis plan are
available in the protocol.

**Trial Oversight**
The trial was designed by a panel of academic
advisors and employees of Merck (in Kenilworth,
New Jersey), the trial sponsor. An external moni

toring committee oversaw the trial and assessed
efficacy and safety at prespecified interim analyses. The trial protocol and all amendments were
approved by the appropriate ethics panel at each
center. All the patients provided written informed
consent before enrollment. Eli Lilly provided the
pemetrexed but otherwise had no role in the trial.
All the authors attest that the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol and all
its amendments and with Good Clinical Practice
standards. All the authors had access to the data
and participated in the writing or reviewing and
editing of the manuscript. The first draft of the
manuscript was written by the first author with
input from authors employed by the sponsor. Assistance in the preparation of the manuscript was
provided by a medical writer employed by the
sponsor. The investigators agreed to keep all aspects of the trial confidential. All the authors vouch
for the accuracy and completeness of the data and
analyses.

**Statistical Analysis**
Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat
population, which included all the patients who
had undergone randomization. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, which included
all patients who had undergone randomization
and received at least one dose of the assigned combination therapy. The Kaplan–Meier method was
used to estimate overall and progression-free survival. Data for patients who were alive or lost to
follow-up were censored for overall survival at
the time they were last known to be alive; data
for patients who crossed over were not censored
at the time of crossover. Data for patients who
were alive and did not have disease progression
or who were lost to follow-up were censored for
the analysis of progression-free survival at the
time of the last imaging assessment. The stratified log-rank test was used to assess betweengroup differences in overall and progression-free
survival. Hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals were calculated with the use of a
stratified Cox proportional-hazards model and
Efron’s method for handling tied events to assess
the magnitude of the treatment difference. Differences in response rate were assessed with the
stratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen. The
randomization stratification factors were applied
to all stratified efficacy analyses.
The full statistical analysis plan specified the

performance of two interim analyses and a final
analysis. The family-wise type I error rate was
strictly controlled at a one-sided alpha level of
0.025 with the use of the graphical method of
Maurer and Bretz (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary
Appendix, available at NEJM.org). If a significant
benefit with regard to one of the primary end
points was found in the pembrolizumab-combination group, the corresponding alpha level would
be rolled over for testing of the other primary end
point. The Lan–DeMets O’Brien–Fleming spending
function was used to control the type I error in
the interim and final analyses.
We determined that the trial would have a
power of 90% to show a hazard ratio for disease
progression or death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha
level of 0.0095 (based on 468 events) and a hazard
ratio of 0.70 for death at a one-sided alpha level
of 0.0155 (based on 416 deaths) for the comparison between the pembrolizumab-combination
group and the placebo-combination group. The
planned enrollment was 570 patients.
The first interim analysis was to be performed
after enrollment was complete and approximately
370 events of progression or death had occurred;
it was estimated that approximately 242 deaths
would have occurred at this time. As of November 8, 2017, there were 410 events of disease progression or death and 235 deaths. On the basis of
the observed number of events, the multiplicityadjusted, one-sided alpha levels at the first interim analysis were 0.00559 for progression-free
survival and 0.00128 for overall survival. Results
were reviewed by the external monitoring committee on January 10, 2018. The monitoring committee reported that the efficacy boundaries for
overall survival and progression-free survival had
been met. The trial is continuing in order to evaluate outcomes with additional follow-up. All data
reported here are based on the first interim
analysis.


Results


**Patients and Treatment**
A total of 965 patients were screened for enrollment at 126 sites in 16 countries (Fig. S2 in the
Supplementary Appendix). Between February 26,
2016, and March 6, 2017, a total of 616 patients
from 118 sites who had met all the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumabcombination group (410 patients) or the placebo

combination group (206 patients). The baseline
demographic and disease characteristics were generally well balanced between the groups, although
the percentage of men was higher in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebocombination group (62.0% vs. 52.9%, P = 0.04)
(Table 1). A PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 1%
or greater was reported in 63.0% of the patients,
carboplatin was the chosen platinum-based drug
in 72.2% of the patients, and 88.1% of the patients
were current or former smokers.
Of the 616 patients who were enrolled, 405 in
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 202 in
the placebo-combination group received at least
one dose of the assigned combination therapy.
With a median follow-up of 10.5 months (range,
0.2 to 20.4), the mean (±SD) duration of treatment
was 7.4±4.7 months in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 5.4±4.3 months in the placebocombination group. All four planned doses of
cisplatin or carboplatin were received by 82.5%
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and by 74.3% of those in the placebocombination group; 76.5% and 66.8%, respectively, received five or more doses of pemetrexed.
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix shows
the exposure to treatment in patients who received
carboplatin and in those who received cisplatin.)
At the time of the data cutoff in the as-treated
population, 137 of 405 patients (33.8%) in the
pembrolizumab-combination group and 36 of
202 patients (17.8%) in the placebo-combination
group were still receiving the assigned treatment
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the
intention-to-treat population, 125 of 410 patients
(30.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group
and 96 of 206 patients (46.6%) in the placebocombination group had received at least one subsequent therapy either while continuing to participate in the trial or outside the trial (Table S2 in
the Supplementary Appendix). In the placebocombination group, 67 of 206 patients (32.5%) had
crossed over during the trial to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy after disease progression.
An additional 18 patients (8.7%) had received immunotherapy outside the trial, which resulted in
an effective crossover rate of 41.3% in the intention-to-treat population and 50.0% in the 170 patients who had discontinued all trial drugs. The
effective crossover rate in the intention-to-treat
population was similar across the subgroups of
PD-L1 tumor proportion score.

- Patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group received pemetrexed, a platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab;
those in the placebo-combination group received pemetrexed, a platinum-based drug, and placebo. Percentages may
not total 100 because of rounding.
† There was a significant between-group difference in the proportion of men (P = 0.04). There were no significant differences in any other baseline characteristics between groups at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.
‡ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status scores range from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher scores indicating greater disability.[8] Data regarding the ECOG status were missing for 2 patients
(0.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 1 patient (0.5%) in the placebo-combination group.
§ Other histologic features include large-cell carcinoma (5 patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 2 in
the placebo-combination group), adenosquamous tumors (2 patients in the placebo-combination group), and other
nonsquamous tumor (1 patient in the pembrolizumab-combination group).

- The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score was defined as the percentage of tumor cells with
membranous PD-L1 expression.
‖ PD-L1 expression could not be evaluated because specimens had an inadequate number of tumor cells or no tumor
cells. For stratification purposes, patients with PD-L1 expression that could not be evaluated were included in the subgroup with a tumor proportion score of less than 1%; these patients were excluded from analyses of efficacy according
to the PD-L1 tumor proportion score.

**Overall Survival**
With 235 deaths in the intention-to-treat population, the estimated proportion of patients who
were alive at 12 months was 69.2% (95% confi

dence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 49.4% (95% CI,
42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-combination group.
The median overall survival was not reached in

the pembrolizumab-combination group and was
11.3 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 15.1) in the placebocombination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49;
95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). The
benefit of the pembrolizumab combination was
observed in all subgroups that were analyzed
(Fig. 1B), including those with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of less than 1% (12-month overall
survival rate, 61.7% vs. 52.2%; hazard ratio for
death, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.92), a score of 1 to
49% (12-month overall survival rate, 71.5% vs.
50.9%; hazard ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.90),
and a score of 50% or greater (12-month overall
survival rate, 73.0% vs. 48.1%; hazard ratio, 0.42;
95% CI, 0.26 to 0.68) (Fig. 2).

**Progression-free Survival**
With 410 events of progression or death, the
median progression-free survival was 8.8 months
(95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5)
in the placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for
progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64;
P<0.001) (Fig. 3A). The estimated proportion of
patients who were alive and progression-free at
12 months was 34.1% (95% CI, 28.8 to 39.5) in
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 17.3%
(95% CI, 12.0 to 23.5) in the placebo-combination
group. The results were similar when progression
was assessed according to investigator review
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The hazard ratio for progression-free survival was less than
1.00 across all subgroups that were analyzed
(Fig. 3B) and across all subgroups of PD-L1 tumor proportion score (Fig. 4), although the upper boundaries of the 95% confidence intervals
crossed 1.00 for patients who were 65 years or


older (median, 9.0 months vs. 6.7 months; hazard
ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.02) and those with
a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of less than 1%
(median, 6.1 months vs. 5.1 months; hazard ratio,
0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.05).

**Tumor Response**
The response rate as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review was 47.6% (95% CI,
42.6 to 52.5) in the pembrolizumab-combination
group and 18.9% (95% CI, 13.8 to 25.0) in the
placebo-combination group (P<0.001). The results
were similar when the response was assessed by
investigator review (Table S3 in the Supplementary
Appendix). The disease control rate (the proportion
of patients with a confirmed complete or partial
response or stable disease) was 84.6% in the
pembrolizumab-combination group and 70.4%
in the placebo-combination group. The change
from baseline in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions is shown in Figure S4 in the
Supplementary Appendix.
The median duration of response was 11.2
months (range, 1.1+ to 18.0+) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 7.8 months (range, 2.1+
to 16.4+) in the placebo-combination group. (Plus
signs in the ranges indicate that there was no
progressive disease at the time of the last disease
assessment.) The response rate was higher in the
pembrolizumab-combination group than in the
placebo-combination group across all categories of
PD-L1 tumor proportion score, with the greatest
between-group difference in patients with a tumor
proportion score of 50% or greater (61.4% vs.
22.9%) (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).

**Adverse Events**
Adverse events of any cause and regardless of attribution to treatment by the investigator occurred
in 99.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumabcombination group and in 99.0% of those in the
placebo-combination group (Table 2). These events
were of grade 3 or higher in 67.2% and 65.8% of
the patients, respectively. Discontinuation of all
trial drugs because of adverse events occurred in
13.8% of the patients in the pembrolizumabcombination group and in 7.9% of those in the
placebo-combination group; discontinuation rates
of pembrolizumab and placebo were 20.2% and
10.4%, respectively (Table 2). The rates of adverse
events were similar in patients who received carboplatin and cisplatin (Tables S4 and S5 in the
Supplementary Appendix). Adverse events led to

in the placebo-combination group (Table 3). These
events were of grade 3 or higher in 36 of 405 patients (8.9%) and 9 of 202 patients (4.5%), respectively. Three immune-mediated adverse events (all
pneumonitis) led to death in the pembrolizumabcombination group.


Discussion


death in 27 of 405 patients (6.7%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 12 of 202
patients (5.9%) in the placebo-combination group.
In the two groups, the most common adverse
events were nausea, anemia, and fatigue (Table 2;
exposure-adjusted rates are provided in Table S6
in the Supplementary Appendix). The only adverse
events that were reported in at least 10% of the
patients that were more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group were diarrhea and
rash (Fig. S6A in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that were reported in at least 10% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group or the placebocombination group were anemia (16.3% and 15.3%)
and neutropenia (15.8% and 11.9%) (Table 2). The
only adverse event of grade 3 or higher that was
more frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group was febrile neutropenia (Fig. S6B in
the Supplementary Appendix). Acute kidney injury
occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumabcombination group than in the placebo-combination group (5.2% vs. 0.5%). In the pembrolizumab-combination group, acute kidney injury
was of grade 3 or higher in 8 patients (2.0%) and
led to the discontinuation of all trial therapy in
8 patients (2.0%); at the time of this analysis, acute
kidney injury of grade 3 or lower had resolved or
was resolving in 9 of 19 patients.
Immune-mediated adverse events, which were
defined on the basis of a list of terms specified
by the sponsor and were included in the analysis
regardless of whether they were attributed to treatment by the investigator, occurred in 92 of 405
patients (22.7%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 24 of 202 patients (11.9%)


In this phase 3 trial, we found that adding pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy with pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in a risk
of the two primary end points that was approximately 50% lower than the risks with standard
chemotherapy alone in patients with untreated,
metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing EGFR or ALK mutations. Together with the
results from KEYNOTE-024,[12,13] the data from
KEYNOTE-189 suggest that introducing immunotherapy as a first-line therapy may have a favorable
long-term effect on outcomes.
The survival benefit associated with the pembrolizumab combination was observed in all subgroups of PD-L1 tumor proportion scores, including patients with a score of less than 1%, a
population for which single-agent PD-1 and PD-L1
inhibition have a small chance of benefit.[12,14-19] The
greatest relative benefit was observed in the subgroup with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of
50% or greater, a finding that was consistent with
the results of previous studies of PD-1 pathway
inhibition in advanced NSCLC.[14,15,20,21] An important question for further study is whether the
addition of pembrolizumab to pemetrexed and a
platinum-based drug has greater efficacy than
pembrolizumab monotherapy in these patients.
Without direct comparisons, physicians and patients will need to have an individualized discussion of benefit.[22]

Although the outcomes in the placebo-combination group appeared to be poorer than those in
patients who had received pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug in some historical studies,[23-25] the
rates of disease control and progression-free survival were consistent with those in many landmark
studies.[12,26-29] The median overall survival in our
trial may change with longer follow-up because
there was substantial censoring of the Kaplan–
Meier curves around the time that the medians

- Listed are all adverse events that occurred during the trial period or within 30 days thereafter (within 90 days for serious events), regardless
of attribution to any trial treatment by the investigator. Adverse events that occurred during crossover from the placebo-combination group
to pembrolizumab monotherapy are excluded. The as-treated population included all the patients who had undergone randomization and
received at least one dose of the assigned combination therapy.
† This category includes patients who discontinued pemetrexed, a platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab or placebo because of an adverse event at any time and patients who discontinued pemetrexed and pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing
four cycles of a platinum-based drug.
‡ Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event.
§ The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were pneumonitis in 3 patients; intestinal ischemia in 2 patients; and acute kidney injury, acute kidney injury plus neutropenic sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrest plus respiratory failure, cardiac failure, cardiopulmonary failure, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, encephalopathy, hemoptysis, ischemic stroke, lung
infection, mesenteric-artery embolism, myocardial infarction, neutropenic sepsis, peritonitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, pneumonia,
and septic shock in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death in the placebo-combination group were cerebral hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemoptysis, intracranial hemorrhage, hypokalemia plus supraventricular tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonia plus respiratory failure, renal failure,
respiratory failure, and septic shock in 1 patient each; 1 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause.

- The events of interest are those with an immune-related cause and are considered regardless of attribution to a trial
drug by the investigator. The events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination
group. In addition to the specific preferred terms that are listed, related terms were also included. The as-treated population included all the patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned combination therapy.


were reached in this analysis. As expected in the
era of immunotherapy, the survival curves in the
two groups seemed to be reaching a plateau at
the time of this analysis.
The addition of pembrolizumab did not appear to increase the frequency of adverse events
that are commonly associated with chemotherapy
regimens involving pemetrexed and a platinumbased drug. Similarly, the incidence of most immune-mediated adverse events was not higher
with pembrolizumab-combination therapy than
that previously observed with pembrolizumab
monotherapy.[12,14,20] The exception may be nephritis
and acute kidney injury, both of which are also
associated with pemetrexed[30] and platinum-based
drugs[31] and occurred with a greater frequency in
this trial than in earlier trials of pembrolizumab
monotherapy.[12,14,20] The frequency of deaths attributed to pneumonitis in this trial was consistent
with the frequency previously observed with pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC.[12,14,20]


In conclusion, in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without sensitizing _EGFR or_
_ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab_
to induction therapy with pemetrexed and a
platinum-based drug and to pemetrexed maintenance therapy resulted in significantly longer
overall survival and progression-free survival and
a higher response rate than the addition of placebo at a cost of a low incidence of renal dysfunction at the first interim analysis. The survival
benefit for pembrolizumab-combination therapy
was observed across all categories of PD-L1 expression.
