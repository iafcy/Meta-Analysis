### Summary
**Background** **There are few effective treatment options for patients with recurrent or metastatic head-and-neck**
**squamous cell carcinoma. Pembrolizumab showed antitumour activity and manageable toxicity in early-phase trials.**
**We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care therapy for the treatment of**
**head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.**

**Methods We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 97 medical centres in 20 countries. Patients with head-**
**and-neck squamous cell carcinoma that progressed during or after platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or**
**metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3–6 months of previous multimodal**
**therapy containing platinum for locally advanced disease, were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum**
**with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every**
**3 weeks intravenously or investigator’s choice of standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab intravenously**
**(standard-of-care group). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was**
**analysed in the as-treated population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042, and is no**
**longer enrolling patients.**

**Findings Between Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 247 patients were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab and**
**248 were randomly allocated to standard of care. As of May 15, 2017, 181 (73%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab**
**group and 207 (83%) of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group had died. Median overall survival in the intention-**
**to-treat population was 8·4 months (95% CI 6·4–9·4) with pembrolizumab and 6·9 months (5·9–8·0) with standard**
**of care (hazard ratio 0·80, 0·65–0·98; nominal p=0·0161). Fewer patients treated with pembrolizumab than with**
**standard of care had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events (33 [13%] of 246 vs 85 [36%] of 234). The most**
**common treatment-related adverse event was hypothyroidism with pembrolizumab (in 33 [13%] patients) and**
**fatigue with standard of care (in 43 [18%]). Treatment-related death occurred in four patients treated with**
**pembrolizumab (unspecified cause, large intestine perforation, malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-**
**Johnson syndrome) and two patients treated with standard of care (malignant neoplasm progression and pneumonia).**

**Interpretation The clinically meaningful prolongation of overall survival and favourable safety profile of pembrolizumab**
**in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma support the further evaluation of**
**pembrolizumab as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapy in earlier stages of disease.**

### Introduction
Despite multimodal therapy including platinum-based
chemoradiotherapy, more than 50% of patients with
loco­regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck have recurrence or develop metastases
(or both) within 3 years of treatment.[1–3] Platinum-based
combination chemotherapy regimens and cetuximab
are commonly used in the first-line recurrent and
metastatic settings.[1,2] The EXTREME regimen, which
consists of platinum, fluorouracil, and cetuximab, is
approved in many countries for first-line treatment of


patients whose disease pro­gressed more than 6 months
after receiving a platinum-containing chemoradiotherapy
regimen ad­mi­nistered with curative intent.[4] Until 2017,
treatment options for recurrent and metastatic disease
following progression on a platinum-based regimen
were limited to single-agent chemotherapy or cetuximab,
which yield a median overall survival of 7 months
or less.[1,2,5–7]

Inhibitors of the programmed death 1 (PD-1) path­
way, which is implicated in tumour immune escape,
have emerged as valid treatment options in patients

with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck on
the basis of their antitumour activity and safety profiles.[8–14]
The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab
had a manageable safety profile and produced objective
responses in 16–18% of patients with recurr­
ent or metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell carci­
noma in the phase 1b KEYNOTE-012[8,9] and phase 2
KEYNOTE-055[12] studies. On the basis of these data, we
initiated the international, randomised, open-label, phase
3 KEYNOTE-040 trial to compare the efficacy and safety
of pembrolizumab with those of an investigator’s choice
of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab (standard of
care) in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck that progressed
during or after platinum-based chemotherapy.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at
97 medical centres in 20 countries. Patients were eligible
for enrolment if they met the following criteria: aged
18 years or older; had histologically or cytologically
confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity,
oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx, incurable by local
therapies; had disease progression during or after


**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
We searched PubMed on April 11, 2018, using the terms “PD-1”,
“PD-L1”, “MK-3475”, “lambrolizumab”, “pembrolizumab”,
“Keytruda”, “BMS-936558”, “nivolumab”, “Opdivo”,
“MPDL3280A”, “atezolizumab”, “Tecentriq”, “MEDI4736”,
“durvalumab”, “Imfinzi”, “MSB0010718C”, “avelumab”, or
“Bavencio” and “head and neck cancer”. We applied no time
limits or language restrictions to the search. We also searched
the abstracts for the 2016 and 2017 American Society of Clinical
Oncology Annual Meeting and the 2016 and 2017 European
Society for Medical Oncology Congress using the same search
terms to identify results of any clinical trials that were not yet
published in the peer-reviewed literature. We identified one
randomised phase 3 trial of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) or
anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) monotherapy for
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck—the
CheckMate 141 study of nivolumab versus investigator’s choice
of docetaxel, methotrexate, or cetuximab for patients with
recurrent or metastatic disease following platinum-based
chemotherapy. Phase 1 and phase 2 studies of anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy for recurrent or metastatic squamous
cell carcinoma of the head and neck were identified, including
the phase 1 KEYNOTE-012 and phase 2 KEYNOTE-055 studies of
pembrolizumab, a phase 1 study of atezolizumab
(NCT01375842), and the phase 2 HAWK study of durvalumab.

**Added value of this study**
To our knowledge, these data are the first published report of
a randomised, controlled trial of pembrolizumab as therapy


for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the
head and neck. Pembrolizumab provides a clinically
meaningful prolongation of overall survival and has a
favourable safety profile compared with standard-of-care
therapy with methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab. There
was a clear relationship between higher PD-L1 expression and
the benefit of pembrolizumab relative to standard-of-care
therapy. Receipt of an immune checkpoint inhibitor by
patients in the standard-of-care group appeared to decrease
the treatment effect of pembrolizumab, a finding that has
implications for future oncology studies, particularly those
done in patients with cancer for which immune checkpoint
inhibitors have received regulatory approval.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapy have a favourable
benefit-to-risk profile in patients with recurrent or metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that progress
after platinum-based chemotherapy. The benefit of
pembrolizumab monotherapy appears to be greater in
patients whose tumours express PD-L1 than in patients
whose tumours do not express the ligand. The survival benefit
and safety profile of monotherapy with anti-PD-1 and antiPD-L1 therapies in the recurrent or metastatic setting support
the evaluation of monotherapy in earlier stages of disease
and the evaluation of combination regimens that include
PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors.


platinum-containing treatment for recurrent or meta­
static disease (or both) or had recurrence or progression
within 3–6 months of previous multimodal therapy
containing platinum for locally advanced disease;
received two or fewer lines of therapy for recurrent or
metastatic disease; had known human papilloma virus
(HPV) p16 status for oro­pharyngeal cancer; had known
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression status;
had at least one measurable lesion according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),
version 1.1;[15] and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) per­for­mance status score of 0 or 1
(on a five-point scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms
and higher numbers indicating greater disability).[16]
Patients were ineligible if their disease progressed
within 3 months of completing definitive treatment for
locoregionally advanced or recurrent disease or had
received previous immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.
Full eligibility criteria are listed in the trial protocol,
which is available in the appendix.
The trial protocol and all amendments were approved
by the appropriate ethics body at each centre. The study
was done in accordance with the protocol and its amend­
ments and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients
provided written informed consent before enrolment


-----

#### Randomisation
Patients were enrolled by the study investigators and
randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio using a central interactive
voice response and integrated web response system
(Almac Clinical Technologies, Souderton, PA, USA)
to receive pembrolizumab or investi­gator’s choice of
methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab. Randomisation was
stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), p16 status
in the oropharynx (positive vs negative), and PD-L1 tumour
proportion score (≥50% vs <50%). Treatment was allocated
in blocks of four in each stratum. The allocation schedule
was generated by the system vendor using a computerised
random list generator. Neither patients nor investigators
were masked to group assignment.

#### Procedures
Patients assigned to pembrolizumab received 200 mg
every 3 weeks intravenously. Those assigned to investi­
gator’s choice received either methotrexate 40 mg/m²
per week intravenously (could be increased to 60 mg/m²
per week in the absence of toxicity), docetaxel
75 mg/m² every 3 weeks intravenously, or cetuximab
250 mg/m² per week intravenously following a loading
dose of 400 mg/m². Patients received treatment until
disease progression, development of unacceptable
toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or physician decision; the
maximum duration of pembrolizumab treatment was
24 months. Clinically stable patients with radiological
disease progression could continue study treatment until
pro­gression was confirmed on a scan obtained at least
4 weeks later. There was no planned crossover on disease
progression. Tumour imaging was done at baseline,
week 9, then every 6 weeks during year 1 and every
9 weeks thereafter. Patients were contacted every
12 weeks to assess survival during follow-up. Adverse
events and laboratory abnormalities were collected
throughout treatment and for 30 days thereafter (90 days
for seri­ous adverse events and those of special interest to
pembrolizumab treatment) and graded using the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
Oropharyngeal p16 status was assessed as a surrogate
of HPV association using the CINtec p16 Histology assay
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA) with a
cutoff point for positivity of 70% of cells. PD-L1 expression
was assessed at a central laboratory in formalin-fixed
tumour samples during screening using the PD-L1 IHC
22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria,
CA, USA). Expression was categorised by the tumour
proportion score, defined as the percentage of tumour
cells with membranous PD-L1 staining, and by the
combined positive score, defined as the number of
PD-L1-positive cells (tumour cells, lymphocytes, and
macro­­phages) divided by the total number of tumour
cells multiplied by 100. The combined positive score was
previously reported as a percentage but is now reported
as a unitless measure


#### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival, defined as the
time from randomisation to death from any cause in
the total population. Secondary endpoints were overall
survival in the popu­lation with a PD-L1 combined positive
score of 1 or higher and the following endpoints in all
participants and those with a PD-L1 combined positive
score of 1 or higher: safety; progression-free survival,
defined as the time from randomisation to disease
progression or death from any cause, assessed according
to RECIST version 1.1[15] and modified RECIST (which is
the same as RECIST version 1.1 except that a confirmatory
assessment of disease progression done at least 4 weeks
after the initial progressive disease assessment is
required) by masked, independent central radiological
review; objective response rate, defined as the percentage
of patients who had a complete or partial response,
regardless of confirmation, assessed according to RECIST
version 1.1 by masked, indepen­dent central radiological
review; duration of confirmed response, defined as
the time from the first documentation of complete or
partial response to disease progression or death, assessed
according to RECIST version 1.1 by masked, independent
central radiological review; and time to progression,
defined as the time from randomisa­tion to first
documented disease progression, assessed according to
RECIST version 1.1 by masked, independent central
radiological review. Protocol-specified exploratory end­
points included overall and progression-free survival and
the proportion of patients with an objective response in
the population with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of
50% or higher. The full list of exploratory endpoints is
available in the protocol.

#### Statistical analysis
The protocol specified two interim analyses and a final
analysis. The independent data monitoring committee
(appendix) recommended that the study continue as
planned after reviewing the results of both interim
analyses, which were done by an unmasked statistician.
The protocol-specified final analysis was planned for
when approximately 340 deaths had occurred. Assuming
median overall survival of 6·2 months in the standard-ofcare group and 340 total events at final analysis, we
calculated that enrolment of 466 patients would provide
the study with 90% power to show a hazard ratio (HR) for
death of 0·70 or better for the comparison of overall
survival in the pembrolizumab group versus the standardof-care group in the total population. The family-wise
type I error rate was strictly controlled at a one-sided α
of 0·025 using the Hwang-Shih-DeCani α-spending
function with a γ parameter of –4. α was allocated in a
stepwise manner starting with the comparison of overall
survival in the total population (appendix). The protocolspecified final analysis was done on the basis of a data
cutoff date of May 15, 2017 (efficacy boundary for overall
survival in the total population one-sided α of 0·0175) At

the time of the protocol-specified final analysis, survival
status was not confirmed for 12 patients. A post-hoc
analysis of overall survival based on the same cutoff date
(ie, May 15, 2017) was done after confirming the survival
status of all 495 randomly allocated patients, including
the aforementioned 12 patients


Overall survival, progression-free survival, objective
response rate, and time to progression were assessed
in the intention-to-treat population, which included all
patients randomly allocated to study treatment. Duration
of response was analysed in all patients who had a best
response of complete or partial response. Safety was
assessed in the as-treated population, which included all
patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.
All statistical analyses were done using SAS, version 9.4.
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and duration of
response were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
Data for patients who were alive or lost to follow-up were
censored at the time of last contact for estimation of
overall survival. Data for patients without disease pro­
gression or who were lost to follow-up were censored
at the time of last tumour imaging for estimation of
progression-free survival. Data for patients who were alive
without evidence of disease progression who discontinued
the study without radiographical evidence of progression
were censored at the time of the last radiographical
assessment showing response. For both progression-free
survival and duration of response, data for patients who
started new anticancer therapy without radiographical
evidence of progression were censored at the time of the
last tumour assessment before new anticancer therapy
was initiated. Between-group differences in overall and
progression-free survival were tested using the stratified
log-rank test. HRs and their associated 95% CIs were
calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards
model and Efron’s method of handling ties.[17] Differences
in the proportion of patients with an objective response
were assessed with the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen
method.[18] The same stratification factors that were applied
to randomisation were applied to all stratified efficacy
analyses. A post-hoc exploratory analysis of the interaction
of subgroups with treatment effect was done using
the likelihood ratio test. This study is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02252042.

### Results
Between Dec 24, 2014, and May 13, 2016, 495 patients
were randomly allocated to pembrolizumab (n=247) or to
investigator’s choice of standard-of-care therapy (n=248)
at one of 97 sites in 20 countries. Of these participants,
246 in the pembrolizumab group and 234 in the standardof-care group received study treatment (figure 1). Baseline
demographics and disease characteristics were generally
balanced between the two treatment groups (table 1). A
PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or higher was

observed in 196 (79%) of 247 patients in the pembro­
lizumab group and 191 (77%) of 248 patients in the
standard-of-care group. Baseline demographics and
disease characteristics for the population with a PD-L1
combined positive score of 1 or higher and the population
with a tumour proportion score of 50% or higher are
summarised in the appendix.
The median duration of follow-up from randomisation
to data cutoff or death, whichever came first, was
7·5 months (IQR 3·4–13·3; 8·4 months [3·3–14·5] in the
pembrolizumab group and 7·1 months [3·7–12·4] in the
standard-of-care group). Overall, 22 (9%) of 247 patients
in the pembrolizumab group and two (1%) of 248 patients
in the standard-of-care group remained on study
treatment at the time of data cutoff (figure 1).
At the time of the protocol-specified final analysis, which
was based on a data cutoff of May 15, 2017, death had
occurred in 179 (72%) of 247 patients in the pembrolizumab
group and 198 (80%) of 248 patients in the standard-ofcare group, with survival status unconfirmed for
12 patients (three in the pembrolizumab group and nine
in the standard-of-care group). The HR for death for
pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care was 0·82 (95% CI
0·67–1·01; one-sided p=0·0316; appendix), which did not
meet the efficacy boundary. After confirming the survival
status of the 12 outstanding patients based on the
same data cutoff, the number of deaths in the intentionto-treat population increased to 181 (73%) of 247 in
the pembrolizumab group and 207 (83%) of 248 in the
standard-of-care group, and the HR for death was 0·80
(95% CI 0·65–0·98; nominal p=0·0161; figure 2A).
Median overall survival was 8·4 months (95% CI 6·4–9·4)
with pembrolizumab and 6·9 months (5·9–8·0) with
standard of care; the estimated proportion of patients who
were alive at 12 months was 37·0% (95% CI 31·0–43·1) in
the pembrolizumab group and 26·5% (21·2–32·2) in
the standard-of-care group. The HR for death was similar
across most subgroups examined, with all 95% CIs
overlapping those of the overall population (figure 2B).
With 300 deaths among the 387 patients with a PD-L1
combined positive score of 1 or higher (138 [70%] of 196 in
the pembrolizumab group and 162 [85%] of 191 in the
standard-of-care group), the HR for death was 0·74
(95% CI 0·58–0·93; nominal p=0·0049; figure 3A).
Median overall survival was 8·7 months (95% CI 6·9–11·4)
with pembrolizumab and 7·1 months (5·7–8·3) with
standard of care. The estimated proportion of patients
surviving at 12 months was 40% (95% CI 33–47) in the
pembrolizumab group and 26% (20–33) in the standardof-care. With 84 deaths among the 104 patients with a
combined positive score less than 1 (42 [84%] of 50 in the
pembrolizumab group and 42 [78%] of 54 in the standardof-care group), the HR was 1·28 (95% CI 0·80–2·07;
p=0·8476) and median overall survival was 6·3 months
(3·9–8·9) in the pembrolizumab group and 7·0 months
(5·1–9·0) in the standard-of-care group (figure 3B). The
nominal two-sided p value for the interaction of treatment


effect and PD-L1 combined positive score was 0·07
(figure 2B). In the population with a PD-L1 tumour
proportion score of 50% or higher, 97 deaths occurred in
129 patients (41 [64%] of 64 in the pembrolizumab group
and 56 [86%] of 65 in the standard-of-care group; HR 0·53,
95% CI 0·35–0·81; nominal p=0·0014; figure 3C). Median
overall survival was 11·6 months (95% CI 8·3–19·5) with
pembrolizumab and 6·6 months (4·8–9·2) with standard
of care, and estimated overall survival at 12 months
was 47% (34–58) and 25% (16–37). In the population with
a tumour proportion score of less than 50%, 287 of
362 patients (139 [76%] of 182 in the pembrolizumab

had died (HR 0·93, 95% CI 0·73–1·17; p=0·2675); median
overall survival was 6·5 months (95% CI 5·6–8·8) with
pembrolizumab and 7·1 months (5·7–8·1) with standard
of care (figure 3D). The nominal, two-sided p value for the
interaction of treatment effect and PD-L1 tumour
proportion score was 0·015 (figure 2B).
In the intention-to-treat population, 36 of 247 patients
in the pembrolizumab group and 25 of 248 in the
standard-of-care group had a confirmed or unconfirmed
response, resulting in a response rate of 14·6% (95% CI
10·4–19·6) and 10·1% (6·6–14·5), respectively (nominal
p=0·0610; appendix). Among the 26 patients in the
pembrolizumab group and 18 patients in the standardof-care group who had a confirmed response, median
time to response was 4·5 months (IQR 2·3–6·4) with
pembrolizumab and 2·2 months (2·1–3·5) with stan­
dard of care. The median duration of response was
18·4 months (95% CI 5·8–18·4) with pembrolizumab
and 5·0 months (3·6–18·8) with standard of care
(appendix). The proportion of patients who had an
objective response in the pembrolizumab group was
higher in patients whose tumours expressed PD-L1 than
in those whose tumours did not, whereas the proportion
in the standard-of-care group was similar regardless of
PD-L1 expression (appendix). Duration of response was
not affected by PD-L1 expression, although the medians

With 442 events of death or disease progression
assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 in the total
population (218 [88%] of 247 in the pembrolizumab group
and 224 [90%] of 248 in the standard of care group), no
difference in progression-free survival between treatment
groups was observed (figure 4). Median progression-free
survival was 2·1 months (95% CI 2·1–2·3) with
pembrolizumab and 2·3 months (2·1–2·8) with standard

categories were east Asia vs the rest of the world). Although not a prespecified
subgroup analysis, the PD-L1 combined positive score breakdown of less than
1 versus 1 or higher was included for completeness. *Subgroups are based on
what the investigator chose before the patient was randomly allocated to
treatment with either pembrolizumab or standard of care (investigators were
required to select a standard-of-care therapy for all patients before random
allocation should they be allocated to that group). The hazard ratios for death
for the comparison of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care therapy in all
subgroups were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by
the randomisation stratification factors. The interaction of each subgroup with
treatment was a post-hoc exploratory analysis done using the likelihood ratio
test. The two-sided p values are not adjusted for multiplicity and, therefore,
nominal only; small p values suggest that the treatment effect varies across
subgroups. ECOG=Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group. HR=hazard ratio.

of care. Progression-free survival in the population with a
PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or higher was similar
to that of the total population, whereas progressionfree survival was longer with pembrolizumab in the
population with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50%
or higher (figure 4); progression-free survival appeared to
be shorter with pembrolizumab than with standard of
care in the populations with a combined positive score of
less than 1 and tumour proportion score of less than 50%.
Median progression-free survival was longer in both
treatment groups when assessed according to modified
RECIST than when assessed with standard RECIST, and
the HRs were close to 1·00 in both the total population
and population with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1
or higher (appendix). No difference in time to progression
assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 was observed in
either the total population or the population with a PD-L1
combined positive score of 1 or higher (appendix).
In the intention-to-treat population, 84 (34%) of
247 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 101 (41%)


of 248 patients in the standard-of-care group received
subsequent therapy, including 11 (4%) of 247 patients in
the pembrolizumab group and 31 (13%) of 248 patients
in the standard-of-care group who received subsequent
therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor
(appendix). In a post-hoc exploratory analysis in the
standard-of-care group, the 31 patients who received
subsequent immune checkpoint inhibition had longer
overall survival than the 70 patients who received other
subsequent therapy and the 147 patients who received
no subsequent therapy (med­ian overall survival of
20·1 months vs 9·7 months vs 4·5 months; appendix).
In a post-hoc sensitivity analysis in which patients in
both treatment groups were censored at the time of
first subsequent immune checkpoint inhibitor, the
HR for death was 0·72 (95% CI 0·58–0·88; nominal
p=0·0008; appendix). In this analysis, median over­
all survival was 8·3 months (95% CI 6·4–9·4) with
pembrolizumab and 6·6 months (5·4–7·5) with stan­
dard of care

In the as-treated population, treatment-related adverse
events occurred in 155 (63%) of 246 patients treated with
pembrolizumab and 196 (84%) of 234 patients treated
with standard of care (table 2). These events were of
grade 3–5 severity in 33 (13%) of 246 patients treated with
pembrolizumab and 85 (36%) of 234 patients treated
with standard of care, and led to treatment discontinuation
in 15 (6%) of 246 and 12 (5%) of 234 patients, respectively.
The incidence of treatment-related adverse events


was similar in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive
score of 1 or higher, with events of any grade occurring in
128 (66%) of 195 patients treated with pembrolizumab
and 150 (82%) of 183 patients treated with standard of
care, events of grade 3–5 severity occurring in 31 (16%) of
195 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 71 (39%)
of 183 patients treated with standard of care, and events
leading to discontinuation occurring in 13 (7%) of
195 patients treated with pembrolizumab and ten (5%) of


-----

183 patients treated with standard of care. In the total
population, four patients treated with pembrolizumab
and two patients treated with standard of care died from
adverse events attributed by the investigator to treatment.
The treatment-related events that led to death were
death of unspecified cause, large intestine perforation,
malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson
syndrome in the pembrolizumab group and malignant
neoplasm progression and pneumonia in the standardof-care group. All but one of the deaths in the pembro­
lizumab group occurred in patients with a combined
positive score of 1 or higher.
The most common treatment-related adverse event
was hypothyroidism (33 of 246 patients [13%]) with
pembrolizumab and fatigue (43 of 234 patients [18%])
with standard of care (table 2). In the pembrolizumab
group, there were four treatment-related adverse events
of grade 3–5 severity that occurred in two or more
patients each compared with 19 such events in the
standard-of-care group. A summary of all treatmentrelated adverse events is available in the appendix. The
adverse events of interest with regard to pembrolizumab,
regardless of attribution to treatment by the investigator,
are summarised in table 2; one of 246 (<1%) patients had
a grade 5 event (ie, resulting in death), which was a
severe skin reaction (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

### Discussion
In the randomised, open-label, phase 3 KEYNOTE-040
trial, pembrolizumab prolonged overall survival com­
pared with investigator’s choice of methotrexate, docetaxel,
or cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. The
benefit of pembrolizumab compared with standard-ofcare therapy was greater in patients with PD-L1 expression
on their tumours or in the tumour microenvironment
than in those without PD-L1 expression. Pembrolizumab
had a better safety profile than standard of care, with
overall profiles consistent with those previously observed
and no new or unexpected toxicities. The frequency of
adverse events of grade 3–5 severity that were attributed to
study treatment by the investigator was 2·7 times lower
with pembrolizumab than with standard of care. More
patients in the pembrolizumab group died from
treatment-related adverse events, although the proportion
was low overall (four [2%] of 246 in the pembrolizumab
group and two [1%] of 234 in the standard-of-care group).
As previously observed for pembrolizumab and
other immune checkpoint inhibitors,[8–10,12–14] responses to
pembrolizumab were durable. The median duration of
response was 18·4 months in the pembrolizumab group,
compared with only 5·0 months in the standard-of-care
group. Also consistent with previous studies of immune
checkpoint inhibitors in the PD-L1–unselected recurrent
or metastatic setting was the absence of a progressionfree survival benefit for pembrolizumab compared with
standard-of-care therapy [10,19–21]


In a post-hoc exploratory analysis not adjusted for
multiplicity, an interaction between the treatment effect
for overall survival and PD-L1 expression appeared to be
present, such that benefit of pembrolizumab was greater
in patients with a combined positive score of 1 or higher
versus those with a combined positive score of less than
1 and those with a tumour proportion score of 50% or
higher versus those with a score of less than 50%.
Although not formally tested, the benefits on progressionfree survival and objective response of pembrolizumab
com­pared with standard-of-care therapy were greater in
patients whose tumours had PD-L1 expression than in
those who did not express the ligand. Of note, all four
complete responses and 30 of 32 partial responses in the
pembrolizumab group occurred in patients with a PD-L1
combined positive score of 1 or higher. Treatment
differences were even greater in patients with a PD-L1
tumour proportion score of 50% or higher The benefit of


-----

pembrolizumab has been shown to be enriched in
patients with PD-L1 expression on their tumours in other
advanced malignancies, including non-small-cell lung
cancer.[22] These data suggest that PD-L1 expression could
be used as an enrichment strategy in future trials of PD-1
blockade.
Our data share similarities and differences with those
of the CheckMate 141 study,[10] in which the anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibody nivolumab showed superior over­
all survival compared with investigator’s choice
of methotrexate, docetaxel, or cetuximab in a similar
patient population to that enrolled in KEYNOTE-040
(HR 0·70, 97·73% CI 0·51–0·96, p=0·01). KEYNOTE-040
and CheckMate 141 used the same comparator treatments
of methotrexate, cetuximab, and docetaxel. Although
docetaxel was the chosen chemo­therapy for a similar
proportion of patients in the standard-of-care group in
CheckMate 141 (45%) and KEYNOTE-040 (44%) trials, the
doses administered were different. In CheckMate 141,
docetaxel was administered at a dose of 30–40 mg/m²
per week, compared with 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks in
KEYNOTE-040. This dif­ference might be relevant given
that data from patients with head-and-neck squamous
cell carcinoma,[23,24] non-small-cell lung cancer,[25] and pros­
tate cancer[26] suggest that lower weekly doses of docetaxel
have less efficacy than higher doses administered once
every 3 weeks. Although neither KEYNOTE-040 nor
CheckMate 141 was powered to compare outcomes in the
experimental group with the individual therapies in
the standard-of-care group, of note is that the relative
treatment effect of pembrolizumab for overall survival in
KEYNOTE-040 was less apparent compared with
docetaxel (HR 0·86) than with metho­trexate (HR 0·75)
or cetuximab (HR 0·56); the HRs in the CheckMate 141
study were 0·82 for docetaxel, 0·64 for methotrexate,
and 0·47 for cetuximab. Both KEYNOTE-040 and
CheckMate 141 enrolled pa­tients with locally advanced
disease that progressed within 6 months of receiving
platinum-based therapy with curative intent. However,
because eligibility in KEYNOTE-040 was restricted to
platinum-refractory disease that progressed between
3 months and 6 months, patients with locally advanced
disease in KEYNOTE-040 might have had a better
prognosis than those in CheckMate 141. Patients whose
only previous systemic therapy was definitive and
administered in the locally advanced setting appeared
to have a greater treatment effect with pembrolizumab
compared with standard of care than the overall study
population. This finding raises speculation not only
about the reasons that the standard-of-care group in
KEYNOTE-040 had a higher than expected survival, with
1 year survival estimates of 26·5% in KEYNOTE-040 and
16·6% in CheckMate 141,[10] but also the prospect that
adjuvant therapy with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors might be
effective in patients with locally advanced squamous cell
carcinoma of the head and neck. Despite the differences
in eligibility criteria between the studies the estimated


survival at 1 year in the pembrolizumab group of
KEYNOTE-040 (37%) was nearly identical to that of the
nivolumab group of CheckMate 141 (36%).[10]

To further understand the better-than-expected overall
survival observed in patients receiving standard-of-care
therapy, we did several post-hoc exploratory analyses.
With a minimum follow-up of 12·2 months since the
last patient enrolled, one or more subsequent immune
checkpoint inhibitors were received by 13% of patients in
the standard-of-care group, compared with only 5% of
patients in the pembrolizumab group. The patients in
the standard-of-care group who received a subsequent
immune checkpoint inhibitor had a median overall
survival that was two times longer than that of patients
who received subsequent therapy other than a checkpoint
inhibitor, and four times longer than that of patients
who received no subsequent therapy (20·1 months _vs_
9·7 months vs 4·5 months, respectively). In an analysis
of overall survival in which patients in both treatment
groups were censored at the time at which they started
subsequent immune checkpoint therapy, median overall
survival in the standard-of-care group decreased to
6·6 months, which was closer to the predicted overall
survival of 6·2 months based on historical data, and the
HR for death decreased to 0·72 (95% CI 0·58–0·88).
These data strongly suggest that subsequent immuno­
therapy influenced outcomes in the standard-of-care
group and confounded analysis of overall survival. To the
best of our knowledge, a similar analysis was not done
in CheckMate-141, in which 5·3% of patients in the
nivolumab group and 10·1% of patients in the standardof-care group received a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor
with a minimum follow-up of 24·2 months since the last
patient enrolled.[27] Future studies of immunotherapy,
particularly those done in patients with cancers for which
checkpoint inhibitors are already approved, should
adequately account for subsequent immunotherapy use
during study design, particularly as this factor pertains to
power calculations.
The results of this study solidify the role of PD-1
checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma. The large population size
and ability to collect tissue samples from the majority
of participants helped show that PD-L1 expression is a
predictive biomarker in this population. Limitations of
the data include the inability to assess the efficacy and
safety of pembrolizumab in patients who did not receive
platinum-based therapy, a group that represents a
substantial minority of patients with head and neck
cancer. Moreover, several hypotheses arise from these
data that will need to be tested to explain the outcomes
observed in various subgroup analyses, including the
subgroups based on HPV status and geographical region
of enrolment.
Our findings suggest that pembrolizumab provides
a clinically meaningful survival benefit compared with
investigator’s choice of methotrexate docetaxel or


-----

cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic headand-neck squamous cell carcinoma that progressed
during or after platinum-based therapy. Post-study
crossover in the standard-of-care group appeared to
confound the analysis and might have decreased the
apparent magnitude of the benefit of pembrolizumab on
overall survival. Pembrolizumab had a favourable safety
profile compared with standard-of-care therapy, and no
new safety signals were observed. Together, these data
support the benefit of pembrolizumab for patients with
recurrent or metastatic head-and-neck squamous cell
carcinoma.
