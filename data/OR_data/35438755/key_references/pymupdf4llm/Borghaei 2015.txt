### Abstract


**Background—Options for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)**
whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy are limited. This randomized, open-label,
international phase 3 study evaluated efficacy and safety of nivolumab versus docetaxel in this
patient population after failure of platinum doublet chemotherapy.

**Methods—Patients were randomized to nivolumab 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks or**
docetaxel 75 mg per square meter every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival.


**Results—Nivolumab improved overall survival versus docetaxel. Median overall survival was**
12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) for nivolumab (n=292) and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7)
for docetaxel (n=290) (hazard ratio, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; P=0.002). One-year overall
survival rates were 51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) for nivolumab and 39% (95% CI, 33 to 45) for
docetaxel. Updated efficacy results with additional follow up are available for overall survival
only: 18-month overall survival rates were 39% (95% CI, 34 to 45) for nivolumab and 23% (95%
CI, 19 to 28) for docetaxel. Response rates were 19% for nivolumab and 12% for docetaxel
(P=0.02). Although progression-free survival did not favor nivolumab (2.3 months for nivolumab
versus 4.2 months for docetaxel), 1-year progression-free survival was higher for nivolumab (19%)
than docetaxel (8%). Nivolumab further improved efficacy across all endpoints at predefined ≥1%,
≥5%, and ≥10% programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor membrane expression levels. Grade
3–5 treatment-related adverse events were reported in 10% of nivolumab and 54% of docetaxeltreated patients.

**Conclusions—Compared to docetaxel, nivolumab demonstrated superior overall survival, with**
PD-L1 expression conferring enhanced efficacy in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC
after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. The safety profile of nivolumab was favorable
versus docetaxel.


### Introduction

Effective options for patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
whose disease progresses after first-line chemotherapy are limited. Docetaxel was approved
as second-line treatment for advanced NSCLC based on improvement in survival versus best
supportive care.[1–3] More tolerable newer agents, such as pemetrexed and erlotinib, were
either shown to be non-inferior or have failed to show superiority in overall survival
compared to docetaxel in this setting.[4,5]

### Methods

**Patients**


The programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor expressed on activated T cells is engaged by
tumor-expressed ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 to downregulate T-cell activation and promote
tumor immune escape.[6] Nivolumab, a fully human IgG4 PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor
antibody, disrupts PD-1-mediated signaling and may restore antitumor immunity.[7–9] In
phase 1 studies, nivolumab monotherapy demonstrated durable anti-tumor activity and
encouraging survival in all NSCLC subtypes.[7,9,10] In heavily pretreated patients with
advanced non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab demonstrated a response rate of 17.6%, 1-, 2-,
and 3-year overall survival rates of 42%, 23%, and 16%, respectively, and a 1-year
progression-free survival rate of 18%.[10] Nivolumab is approved in the United States for
treatment of patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC and progression on or after
platinum-based chemotherapy[11] and in the European Union for locally advanced or
metastatic squamous NSCLC after prior chemotherapy.[12] We report results of a phase 3
study (CheckMate 057; NCT01673867) comparing nivolumab to docetaxel in previously
treated advanced non-squamous NSCLC.

Eligible patients had documented stage IIIB/IV or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC
following radiation therapy or surgical resection, and disease recurrence or progression
during or after one prior platinum-based regimen. An additional line of tyrosine kinase
inhibitor therapy in patients with known EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and
continuation or switch maintenance therapy with pemetrexed, bevacizumab or erlotinib was
allowed. Patients 18 years of age or older, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (a 5-point scale in which higher numbers indicate
greater tumor-related disability), adequate hematologic, hepatic, and renal function, and
treated stable central nervous system (CNS) metastases were eligible. Pretreatment tumor
tissue for biomarker analyses was required but not used for patient selection. Exclusion
criteria included autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease, systemic
immunosuppression, prior treatment with immune-stimulatory antitumor agents including
checkpoint-targeted agents, or docetaxel. Complete eligibility details are provided in the
[study protocol available at NEJM.org.](http://NEJM.org)


**Study design and treatments**

From November, 2012 to December, 2013, 792 patients were enrolled and 582 randomized
to either nivolumab 3 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks (n = 292), or docetaxel 75 mg per
square meter every 3 weeks (n = 290), both intravenously (Fig. S1A). Patients were treated
until disease progression or discontinuation due to toxicity or other reasons (Fig. S1B).


Randomization was stratified by prior maintenance treatment and line of therapy (second- vs
third-line). Nivolumab patients could continue treatment beyond initial progression if the
investigator assessed that the patient was having clinical benefit and tolerating study drug.
Criteria for treatment delay or discontinuation for treatment-related adverse events, and
docetaxel dose reductions for toxicities, per product label, were defined. Nivolumab dose
reductions were not permitted.

**Endpoints and assessments**

The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was assessed while on treatment, and
every 3 months after treatment discontinuation. All randomized patients were followed for
survival, unless they had withdrawn consent from survival follow up. Survival information
was obtained through a search of publicly available sources for patients who withdrew
consent for or were lost to follow up. Secondary efficacy endpoints included investigatorassessed confirmed objective response rate and progression-free survival, efficacy by tumor
PD-L1 expression, and patient-reported outcomes. All randomized patients were followed
for disease progression, except for those who had withdrawn consent from the study or who
were lost to follow up. Tumor response was assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria In
Solid Tumors, version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1)[13] at week 9 and every 6 weeks thereafter until
disease progression. Safety was assessed by evaluating the incidence of adverse events and
laboratory parameters, graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Select adverse events (those with potential
immunologic etiologies) were grouped according to predefined categories. Analyses of
patient-reported outcome measures are ongoing.


**PD-L1 biomarker analysis**

Tumor PD-L1 protein expression was retrospectively assessed in prospectively collected,
pretreatment (archival or recent) tumor biopsies using a validated, automated
immunohistochemical assay (Dako North America, Carpinteria, CA) using a rabbit antihuman PD-L1 antibody (clone 28–8; Epitomics Inc, Burlingame, CA). Predefined
expression levels were defined by tumor cell membrane staining (any intensity) in a section
containing at least 100 evaluable tumor cells.


**Study oversight**

The study was designed by the authors in collaboration with the sponsor, which worked
jointly with investigators to collect and analyze data. The study protocol was approved by an
Institutional Review Board or ethics committee at each participating center, and conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on
Harmonization Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice; the protocol and statistical analysis
plan are available with the full text of the manuscript at www.nejm.org. Written informed
consent was collected from all patients before enrollment.


An independent data monitoring committee provided oversight of safety and efficacy. On
April 16, 2015, the committee declared superiority in overall survival for nivolumab versus
docetaxel. We report the interim analysis results here, including overall survival, objective
response rate, progression free survival and safety, based on a March 18, 2015 database lock.
Updated efficacy results with additional follow up are reported for overall survival only,
based on a July 2, 2015 database lock.

All authors attest that the study was conducted in accordance with the protocol and vouch
for data accuracy. The first draft of this manuscript was written by first and last authors; all
authors contributed to subsequent drafts, agreed to submit the manuscript for publication,

the sponsor, was provided by StemScientific.


**Statistical analyses**

Overall survival and progression-free survival were analyzed using a two-sided log-rank test
stratified by prior maintenance treatment and line of therapy. Hazard ratios and confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated using a stratified, Cox proportional hazards model. Survival
curves and rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Objective response rates
were compared using a stratified, two-sided Cochran-Mantel Haenszel test. Nonconventional benefit (i.e., a reduction in the size or number [or both] of target lesions with
simultaneous appearance of new lesions or initial progression followed by either tumor
reduction or no further progression for at least two tumor assessments) in patients treated
beyond initial progression was not included for response-based analyses (objective response
rate or progression-free survival). Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed on overall
survival, objective response rate and progression-free survival to assess the consistency of
treatment effects among patient subpopulations. All prespecified subgroup analyses of
survival are reported in the supplementary appendix using unstratified hazard ratios and 95%
CIs; hazard ratios were not computed for subgroups with fewer than 10 patients per
treatment group. Additional prespecified analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic
and predictive roles of PD-L1 expression, with an interaction P value of <0.2 considered a
signal of predictive association.


Demographic and efficacy analyses included all randomized patients. Safety analyses
included all treated patients (received at least one dose of study drug). At the time of interim
analysis, 413 patients had expired (93% of the 442 deaths required for the final analysis).
The boundary for declaring superiority for overall survival at the interim analysis was
P<0.0408, based on the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. If superiority for overall
survival was demonstrated, then response rate and progression-free survival were tested
hierarchically at the 5% alpha level. The formal primary endpoint testing was based on the
interim analysis. For full description of the additional follow-up data, an updated p-value is
provided based on July 2, 2015 database lock.


### Results

**Patients and treatment**


Of randomized patients, 287 were treated with nivolumab and 268 were treated with
docetaxel. Median age was 62 years. Most patients were ECOG performance status 1, stage
IV, and current/former smokers (Table 1 and S1). Baseline characteristics were balanced
between treatment groups, with slight imbalances for male sex and age 65 or younger.

A median of 6 doses (range, 1–52) of nivolumab and 4 doses (range, 1–23) of docetaxel
were administered. In the nivolumab and docetaxel groups, respectively, 83% and 66% of
patients received at least 90% of the planned dose intensity. At least one dose delay occurred
in 39% of nivolumab and 37% of docetaxel patients. Most nivolumab (53%, 117/219 cycles)
and docetaxel (67%, 99/147 cycles) delays lasted ≤7 days; 26% of patients required a

docetaxel dose reduction. Forty-five percent of nivolumab and 46% of docetaxel delays were
due to adverse events.

At the time of interim analysis, 15% of nivolumab and no docetaxel patients were continuing
treatment (Table S2). Subsequent systemic therapy was received by 42% of nivolumab and
50% of docetaxel patients. Of nivolumab patients, 23% received subsequent docetaxel; 2%
of docetaxel patients received subsequent immunotherapy (Table S3).


**Efficacy**


Nivolumab significantly improved overall survival versus docetaxel (Fig. 1A). At the time of
interim analysis (minimum follow-up for overall survival, 13.2 months), median overall
survival was 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) for nivolumab and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1
to 10.7) for docetaxel, a 27% reduction in risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to
0.89; P=0.002). One-year overall survival rates were 51% (95% CI, 45 to 56) and 39% (95%
CI, 33 to 45) for nivolumab and docetaxel, respectively. Overall survival hazard ratios
favored nivolumab across most predefined patient subgroups, except for third-line therapy (n
= 66), rest of world region (n = 98), CNS metastases (n = 68), never smokers (n = 118) and
EGFR mutation-positive status (n = 82) (Fig. 1B and S2). With additional follow-up
(minimum, 17.2 months), median overall survival was 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.1) for
nivolumab and 9.4 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 10.7) for docetaxel, a 28% reduction in risk of
death (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.88; P=0.0009) (Fig. S3). Eighteen-month overall
survival rates were 39% (95% CI, 34 to 45) and 23% (95% CI, 19 to 28) for nivolumab and
docetaxel, respectively.

Confirmed objective response rate was significantly higher for nivolumab versus docetaxel
(Table 2 and Fig. S4); 19% (95% CI, 15 to 24) versus 12% (95% CI, 9 to 17) (P=0.02).
Median time to response was 2.1 months (range, 1.2–8.6) for nivolumab and 2.6 months
(range, 1.4–6.3) for docetaxel (Table 2 and Fig. 1C). Median duration of response was 17.2
months (range, 1.8–22.6+) for nivolumab and 5.6 months (range, 1.2+ to 15.2+) for
docetaxel.


Median progression-free survival and 1-year progression-free survival rates were 2.3 months
(95% CI, 2.2 to 3.3) and 19% (95% CI, 14 to 23), respectively, for nivolumab and 4.2
months (95% CI, 3.5 to 4.9) and 8% (95% CI, 5 to 12), respectively, for docetaxel (Fig. 1D).
The hazard ratio for progression-free survival was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.1; P=0.39) (Fig.
1D). Progression-free survival hazard ratios numerically favored nivolumab across most
predefined patient subgroups, except for third-line therapy, rest of world region, never
smokers, KRAS mutation not detected (n = 123) and EGFR mutation-positive status (Fig.
S5).

In total, 71 (25%) nivolumab patients continued treatment beyond initial progression, 16
(23%) of whom demonstrated a non-conventional pattern of benefit. Characteristics of
patients treated beyond progression, including change in tumor burden over time, are
provided (Fig. S6 and Table S4).

**Safety**


Of randomized patients, 78% (455/582) had quantifiable PD-L1 expression. Rates of PD-L1
expression were balanced between groups (Table S5). At the time of interim analysis, test
for interaction suggested a strong predictive association between PD-L1 and clinical
outcome at all expression levels for all efficacy endpoints (Table S6). Nivolumab
demonstrated improved overall survival, progression-free survival (Fig. S7) and objective
response rates (Table S5) at prespecified ≥1%, ≥5% and ≥10% PD-L1 expression levels.
Progression-free survival across all prespecified PD-L1 subgroups based on the interim
analysis database lock is provided in Fig. S8A. Overall survival by PD-L1 expression level
based on the July 2015 database lock is shown in Fig. S8B; the difference in overall survival
between nivolumab and docetaxel among patients whose tumors express PD-L1 was still
evident with additional follow-up. Median duration of response was longer with nivolumab
versus docetaxel across all PD-L1 expression levels (Table S5).

The frequencies of all-causality, any-grade adverse events were similar between arms, but
fewer grade 3– 4 adverse events were reported with nivolumab than docetaxel (Table S7).
Treatment-related adverse events were low in severity with nivolumab and less frequent
(any-grade: 69%; grade 3–4: 10%) than with docetaxel (any-grade: 88%; grade 3–4: 54%)
(Table 3 and S8). The most frequently reported any-grade treatment-related adverse events
for nivolumab were fatigue (16%), nausea (12%), decreased appetite (10%), and asthenia
(10%). The most frequently reported any-grade treatment-related adverse events for
docetaxel were neutropenia (31%), fatigue (29%), nausea (26%), and alopecia (25%).
Treatment-related serious adverse events were less frequent with nivolumab (any-grade: 7%;
grade 3–4: 5%) than docetaxel (any-grade: 20%; grade 3–4: 18%) (Table S9).


The most frequently-reported (≥2.5% of patients) any-grade treatment-related select adverse
events (nivolumab versus docetaxel) were rash (9% versus 3%), pruritus (8% versus 1%),
erythema (1% versus 4%), diarrhea (8% versus 23%), hypothyroidism (7% versus 0%),
increased alanine aminotransferase (3% versus 1%), increased aspartate aminotransferase
(3% versus 1%), infusion related reaction (3% versus 3%), and pneumonitis (3% versus
<1%) (Table S10). Across categories, median times to onset of any-grade treatment-related
select adverse events for nivolumab ranged from 0.9 to 31.1 weeks (Table S11). Of those
who experienced treatment-related select adverse events across categories (Table S11), 11%
to 70% were treated with immune-modulating agents (generally glucocorticoids), per
protocol guidelines. Across categories, 44% to 100% of treatment-related select adverse
events resolved, with median times to resolution ranging from 0.1 to 12.1 weeks (Table
S11). Median time to resolution of treatment-related select endocrinopathies was not
reached, as a proportion of these events are not expected to resolve. The frequencies of
treatment-related adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events leading to
discontinuation were similar between patients with ≥1% PD-L1and <1% PD-L1 expression
(Table S12).

Discontinuation due to treatment–related adverse events was less frequent with nivolumab
(5%) than docetaxel (15%) (Tables S13 and S14). The most common treatment-related
adverse event leading to discontinuation was pneumonitis (1%) for nivolumab, and fatigue

(3%) for docetaxel. One death each in the nivolumab (encephalitis, reported before but
causality changed after the database lock) and docetaxel (febrile neutropenia) groups were
assessed as treatment-related.


### Discussion

Despite the increased number of treatment options for NSCLC, minimal improvement in
overall survival has been noted, except in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK
translocations. Docetaxel is regarded as the standard of care for previously treated advanced
NSCLC and is an appropriate comparator for this trial. In our phase 3 study in advanced
non-squamous NSCLC, nivolumab was associated with a significant survival benefit versus
docetaxel (27% reduction in risk of death at 13.2 months minimum follow up) that persisted
with extended follow up (28% reduction in risk of death at 17.2 months minimum follow
up).


The observed overall survival curve for nivolumab in this population is consistent with a
prior nivolumab study.[10] Furthermore, a delay in the separation of nivolumab and docetaxel
overall survival curves is consistent with results of other immune system-modifying agents
in advanced melanoma.[14]

In a recently published phase 3 study, docetaxel with ramucirumab, a vascular endothelial
growth factor 2 inhibitor, showed a 1.4 month improvement in survival over docetaxel alone
(11.1 versus 9.7 months; hazard ratio, 0.83) in patients with non-squamous NSCLC.[15] In our
study, the overall survival improvement is 2.8 months (12.2 versus 9.4 months; hazard ratio,
0.73) with nivolumab monotherapy which persisted with extended follow-up. A percentage
of patients who were randomized to receive docetaxel were never treated (8%, 22/290);
however, those patients were followed for overall survival, and the impact on the overall
results is minimal. Benefit of nivolumab was further reflected by a significantly higher
objective response rate (19% versus 12%) and markedly better response durability (17.2
versus 5.6 months) as compared to other treatment options for patients in this setting.[4,16,17]


Nivolumab showed significant improvement in overall survival and response rate but not in
progression-free survival. A crossing of progression-free survival curves was noted with a
delay in benefit of nivolumab supported by a 1-year progression-free survival rate of 19%
versus 8% for docetaxel, which may be typical for immunotherapy. The numerically lower
median progression-free survival observed for nivolumab is not due to underperformance, as
median progression-free survival reported here is consistent with another nivolumab study,[10 ]

but may be explained in part by the higher median progression-free survival of docetaxel in
this study (4.2 months) versus previously reported data in non-squamous NSCLC (2.8 to 3.7
months).[15,18] It is also possible that the observed progression-free survival results may be
driven by patient subgroups, as suggested by the subgroup analyses for smoking status and
EGFR mutation. Outcomes observed for patients with EGFR mutation-positive tumors may
be attributed to better outcomes on the docetaxel arm. However, interpretation of these
results is limited by the wide CIs for calculated hazard ratios in a small subset of patients,
and possibly by incomplete collection of mutation data. A biological rationale for different
outcomes in never smokers and EGFR mutation-positive patients may be related to low

levels of mutational heterogeneity, as preliminary data suggest that sensitivity to immunecheckpoint inhibitors may be higher in tumors bearing high levels of somatic mutations.[19,20 ]

However, this study is not designed to test this hypothesis, and additional studies are
warranted to address this question.


The current study, which included patients regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level and
comparison to a control arm, is the first to demonstrate a predictive association between PDL1 expression and benefit from anti-PD-1 treatment. Analyzed tumor samples included
archived tissue, suggesting applicability in a real world setting where fresh tissue may not be
available or repeat biopsy not feasible. For each of the predefined expression levels
examined, the descriptive treatment-biomarker interaction P value met the predefined
threshold, suggesting a predictive association with clinical benefit. Although benefit of
nivolumab was observed in the overall population, the magnitude of benefit across all
efficacy endpoints was greater among those whose tumors express PD-L1 (Figs. S7 and S8
and Table S5). Consistent with a recently reported phase 1 study of pembrolizumab in
NSCLC,[21] there was a trend toward greater response rate as PD-L1 expression level
increased; however, a meaningful separation of the overall survival curves was observed
across all predefined expression levels. Among patients whose tumors express PD-L1 (≥1%,
≥5% and ≥10% expression levels), nivolumab nearly doubled median overall survival versus
docetaxel. No meaningful differences in overall survival were noted between nivolumab and
docetaxel among patients whose tumors have no PD-L1 expression. These data are in
contrast to results with squamous NSCLC, where PD-L1 expression did not impact
nivolumab clinical activity.[22,23] This may imply inherent differences in the immune milieu
of squamous and non-squamous histologies, suggesting two distinct diseases.

Although there was no difference in overall survival between nivolumab and docetaxel
among patients whose tumors have no PD-L1 expression, the improved safety profile and
durability of responses to nivolumab suggests it might be a reasonable option for patients
regardless of PD-L1 expression. Additional work is warranted to characterize subpopulations whose disease progresses early and who may benefit from combination
therapies.


The safety profile of nivolumab observed in this study (Table 3) is consistent with prior
studies and was favorable versus docetaxel, with most patients experiencing adverse events
of low severity. Only a small percentage of nivolumab patients reported immune-related
adverse events, including pneumonitis, which were managed using protocol guidelines.

In summary, nivolumab led to a statistically superior survival benefit versus docetaxel in
unselected patients with advanced previously treated non-squamous NSCLC.
