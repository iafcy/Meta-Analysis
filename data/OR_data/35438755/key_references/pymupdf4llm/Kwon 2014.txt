### Summary


**Background—Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds cytotoxic T-**
lymphocyte antigen 4 to enhance antitumour immunity. Our aim was to assess the use of
ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that
progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.

**Methods—We did a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial in which men with at**
least one bone metastasis from castration-resistant prostate cancer that had progressed after
docetaxel treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy (8
Gy in one fraction) followed by either ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to
four doses. Non-progressing patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo
as maintenance therapy every 3 months until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effect, or
death. Patients were randomly assigned to either treatment group via a minimisation algorithm,
and stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, alkaline phosphatase
concentration, haemoglobin concentration, and investigator site. Patients and investigators were
masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival, assessed in the
[intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)
NCT00861614.


**Findings—From May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned (399 to**
ipilimumab and 400 to placebo), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95% CI 9·5–12·7) with ipilimumab and 10·0 months

(8·3–11·0) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·85, 0·72–1·00; p=0·053). However, the assessment of
the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was violated (p=0·0031). A piecewise hazard
model showed that the HR changed over time: the HR for 0–5 months was 1·46 (95% CI 1·10–
1·95), for 5–12 months was 0·65 (0·50–0·85), and beyond 12 months was 0·60 (0·43–0·86). The
most common grade 3–4 adverse events were immune-related, occurring in 101 (26%) patients in
the ipilimumab group and 11 (3%) of patients in the placebo group. The most frequent grade 3–4
adverse events included diarrhoea (64 [16%] of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group vs seven

[2%] of 396 in the placebo group), fatigue (40 [11%] vs 35 [9%]), anaemia (40 [10%] vs 43

[11%]), and colitis (18 [5%] vs 0). Four (1%) deaths occurred because of toxic effects of the study
drug, all in the ipilimumab group.

**Interpretation—Although there was no significant difference between the ipilimumab group and**
the placebo group in terms of overall survival in the primary analysis, there were signs of activity
with the drug that warrant further investigation.

**Funding—Bristol-Myers Squibb.**


### Introduction

Prostate cancer is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and is the second
leading cause of cancer deaths in men.[1] Prostate cancer that progresses despite castrate
concentrations of testosterone is termed castration-resistant prostate cancer.[2,3] Recently,
several treatments have been approved for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer
after progression with docetaxel chemotherapy, each of which extended overall survival
compared with controls.[4–7] However, new treatments that provide durable disease control
are still needed.


Prostate cancer tissues are often infiltrated by inflammatory cells,[8,9] suggesting that this
cancer is the target of a host immune response. This response can be constrained by various
mechanisms that undermine antitumour immunity.[9–13] As such, a goal of immunotherapy is
to overcome these constraints to enhance tumour regression.[14,15] Currently, the only
approved immunotherapeutic approach for prostate cancer is a vaccine that targets prostatic
acid phosphatase, sipuleucel-T, which has been shown to extend overall survival for patients
with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,
but does not affect prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, induce tumour regression,
or increase progression-free survival.[16] Prostvac VF, a vaccinia virus-based PSA vaccine, is
another antigen-specific immunotherapy[17] that is currently in phase 3 testing for minimally
[symptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov number](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)
NCT01322490), but also has not shown an effect on PSA concentration, tumour regression,
or progression-free survival.

Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the inhibitory cytotoxic Tlymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and thereby enhances antitumour immunity.[18] Responses
triggered by ipilimumab are not believed to be antigen specific, and instead result from
prevention of the CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-lymphocyte activity. On the basis
of results showing increased overall survival in patients with advanced melanoma in phase 3
trials, ipilimumab has been approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in more than

40 countries at a dose of 3 mg/kg.[19,20] Notably, a proportion of patients with melanoma who
received ipilimumab within the clinical development programme remained alive more than 2
years after treatment, suggesting the potential for long-term survival.[21–23] Ipilimumab has
side-effects that are related to its immune-based mechanism of action, but these are
generally manageable using standard treatment algorithms, including proactive monitoring
and early intervention with corticosteroids.

Prostate cancer was one of the first malignant diseases in which CTLA-4 blockade was
tested in preclinical models.[15,24] Clinical potential for this treatment was subsequently
confirmed in several studies of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer,[25–27] including a phase 1/2 dose-escalation trial of ipilimumab in chemotherapynaive and chemotherapy-pretreated patients.[27] Evidence from both preclinical and clinical
studies suggests that radiotherapy might activate the immune system.[28–32] Thus,
radiotherapy is a rational modality to stimulate immune priming amenable to subsequent
amplification by ipilimumab. Consistent with this hypothesis, the combination of
immunotherapy and radiotherapy in a transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops
prostate cancer was shown to result in antitumour T-cell activation, but only when
radiotherapy was given before immunotherapy.[28] Although the precise mechanisms by
which radiotherapy promotes immunotherapeutic responses remain unknown, radiotherapy
might sensitise tumour cells to killing by antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.[29 ]

Radiotherapy also promotes the local infiltration of immune cells into the tumour,[30] and
might trigger antitumour immune responses at locations distant from the original site of
irradiation (abscopal effect).[31,32] In the clinical setting, the combination of radiotherapy and
ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg is well tolerated in patients with metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer.[27]


On the basis of existing evidence, phase 3 trials of ipilimumab for patients with metastatic
[castration-resistant prostate cancer were initiated in chemotherapy-naive (ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)
number NCT01057810) and post-docetaxel populations. Here, we report results from a
phase 3 trial of ipilimumab after radiotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer who progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy.


### Methods

**Study design and patients**


In this randomised, double-blind, controlled phase 3 trial (CA184-043), done in 191 centres
across 26 countries, we enrolled male patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or
cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, at least one bone metastasis that
could be irradiated or warranted irradiation in the clinical judgment of the investigator,
testosterone concentration less than 1·74 nmol/L, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Patients must have received at least one
previous docetaxel-containing regimen for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,
consisting of at least two cycles of docetaxel, and progressed while receiving, or within 6
months of receiving, the docetaxel regimen. Disease progression was assessed on the basis
of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group’s recommendations.[2] Patients were
excluded if they had received more than two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for

castration-resistant prostate cancer or if they had brain metastases, an autoimmune disease,
or a known HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection.

The institutional review boards at all participating centres approved the study, which was
done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.
All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the study.


**Randomisation and masking**

Random assignment was done with an interactive voice response system via the Pocock and
Simon minimisation algorithm, stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), alkaline
phosphatase concentration (<1·5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] vs ≥1·5 times ULN),
haemoglobin concentration (<110 g/L vs ≥110 g/L), and investigator site.


**Procedures**


The study funder, patients, and site staff were masked with respect to each patient’s
assignment until the database cutoff date for this report (ie, when the required number of
events [deaths] for the primary analysis had occurred). Local pharmacists and the pharmacy
monitors (who prepared and dispensed study drugs to the blinded research staff ) were not
masked. An independent data monitoring committee had access to unblinded data to enable
review of emerging safety data. In the event of a medical emergency in an individual patient,
the treating physician could be informed of the assigned treatment if knowledge of the
investigational product was crucial to the patient’s management.

We randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive bone-directed radiotherapy followed
by either ipilimumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ, USA) at 10 mg/kg or placebo
every 3 weeks for up to four doses. Both ipilimumab and placebo (0·9% sodium chloride or
5% dextrose) were given by intravenous infusion over a 90-min period. Non-progressing
patients could continue to receive ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg or placebo as maintenance
therapy every 3 months. Treatment with either ipilimumab or placebo continued until
confirmed disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, clinical deterioration, death,
withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. No dose reductions were permitted. A dose of
study drug could be skipped for any grade 2 or higher non-skin-related adverse event, any
grade 3 or higher laboratory abnormality, or any grade 3 or higher skin-related adverse
event, irrespective of cause. Treatment could be discontinued at any time because of an
unacceptable toxic effect (ie, an adverse event attributable to the study drug that required
permanent discontinuation of the drug or an adverse event that, in the investigator’s opinion,
presented a substantial risk to the patient with continued administration), clinical
deterioration, or confirmed disease progression (by PSA or radiographic assessment).
Patients were treated as per local standard of care after discontinuing study treatments;
crossover was not permitted.


All patients received a single dose of radiotherapy of 8 Gy for at least one, and up to five,
bone fields, at the investigator’s discretion. This single-administered radiation dose (8 Gy in
one treatment fraction) was previously shown to be therapeutically equivalent to a
fractionated regimen (30 Gy in ten treatment fractions over 2 weeks) with respect to pain

palliation.[33] Radiotherapy was done some time within the 2 days before initiation of the
study drug regimen, and palliative radiotherapy was allowed for any bone lesion while on
study. Sites of radiotherapy included the arm, leg, pelvis, spine, rib, and skull. We did not
assess the efficacy of the radiotherapy with respect to pain palliation or lesional regression
as part of the study, because it was given to stimulate immune response. Until database lock,
investigators assessing disease progression (including by radiographic assessment) remained
masked to treatment allocation.

Tumour assessments by radiographic imaging (eg, MRI or CT of chest, abdomen, pelvis,
and other soft tissue, and bone scans, as applicable) were done every 12 weeks. Progression
per bone scan was defined as the appearance of two or more new lesions in two consecutive
assess ments; nodal or visceral disease progression in target lesions was assessed by
modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.0. PSA concentrations
were measured in serum panels by use of an automated immunochromatographic membrane
assay at a central laboratory every 6 weeks until the patient received subsequent therapies,
after which they were measured every 12 weeks. Pain response was assessed every 12 weeks
with the Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form), and was defined as a decrease in average daily
worst pain intensity (question 3) by at least 30% from baseline, maintained over two
consecutive assessments, without any rescue drug treatment, or increase in analgesic use in
the same time period. Safety characterisation was based on events that occurred throughout
the on-study period (from the first dose of study drug to 70 days after the last dose of study
drug, including maintenance therapy). Adverse events were graded in accordance with the
National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).


**Outcomes**


The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival, defined as time from random
assignment to death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included progression-free
survival, pain response, and safety profile. Progression-free survival was a composite
endpoint based on confirmed PSA progression, which was defined as a PSA increase of at
least 25% and at least 2 µg/L above PSA concentration nadir on or after week 12 (confirmed
over two subsequent assessments), confirmed radiological progression, clinical
deterioration, or death. Clinical deterioration was defined as a persistent decrease in
performance status (ie, lasting more than 14 days) of at least 2 points from baseline
performance that was attributable to: disease progression; any symptomatic clinical event
attributable to disease progression that, in the investigator’s opinion, suggested that the
patient was not benefiting from study treatment and could be managed by supportive care
(eg, bisphosphonates or bone-directed radiotherapy); or any change of antineoplastic therapy
because of prostate cancer. Exploratory endpoints included PSA response rate and quality of
life.


**Statistical analysis**

The primary analysis was a between-group comparison of overall survival by use of a
stratified log-rank test in the intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients).
The study was designed to ensure 90% power (two-sided α=0·05) to reject the null
hypothesis of no effect of ipilimumab, assuming a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0·76. Under an

exponential distribution, this HR would correspond to a median overall survival of 15·8
months for the ipilimumab group and 12·0 months in the placebo group. We planned to
enrol 800 patients to observe 560 events (deaths). The study database was locked for the
primary analysis on Feb 6, 2013, when a total of 574 deaths had occurred. All efficacy
endpoints were based on the intention-to-treat population, apart from the PSA analyses
(done in PSA-assessable patients), and safety was assessed in all treated patients. For PSA
response, assessable patients were defined as randomly assigned patients with both a nonmissing PSA baseline value and at least one on-study value.

We used the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method[34] to estimate the overall and progressionfree survival probabilities for each treatment group.[34,35] We examined proportional-hazards
assumptions by testing the period-by-treatment interaction term in a time-dependent Cox
model,[36] with period as a binary variable (before or after the timepoint when obvious
separation of the curves began). In an exploratory analysis, we used a piecewise hazard
model to further assess the assumptions of the Cox model, and to provide estimates of the
HR over time (ie, before, during, and after crossover of the survival curves). We also did
post-hoc analyses of overall survival in protocol-specified subgroups, based on clinically
known prognostic risk factors for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, using a
multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Additionally, we did post-hoc treatment
interaction tests using baseline prognostic factors as covariates; separate Cox models were
used (one for each baseline factor), with treatment and each baseline factor as main effects
and the treatment-by-baseline factor interaction included to test whether the treatment effect
differed for patients with different levels of the specific factor.


The protocol specified that a statistical comparison of progression-free survival between
groups was to be done only if the groups differed significantly for the primary endpoint of
overall survival. Although there was no significant difference in overall survival between
patients groups, we decided to compare progression-free survival anyway to allow us to
further assess the potential activity of ipilimumab in metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer. Accordingly, statistical findings for secondary and exploratory analyses are reported
for descriptive purposes only. Demographic and baseline characteristics, safety, and
outcome research instruments (eg, pain intensity) are summarised descriptively.

Statistical analyses were done with SAS version 8.2.

### Results


From May 26, 2009, to Feb 15, 2012, 799 patients were randomly assigned: 399 to the
ipilimumab group and 400 to the placebo group (figure 1). Baseline patient characteristics
were balanced across groups, and were indicative of advanced disease (table 1). 12 (3%) of
399 patients in the ipilimumab group and eight (2%) of 400 patients in the placebo group
discontinued before receiving the assigned treatment; of these patients, six (2%) and four
(1%), respectively, received radiotherapy only. Of the 387 patients who received
radiotherapy and ipilimumab, and the 392 who received radiotherapy and placebo, 198
(51%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 262 (67%) in the placebo group received at least
four doses of study drug. Patients did not receive all four initial doses of study drug for
various reasons, most often disease progression (118 [30%] of 387 patients in the
ipilimumab group, and 221 [56%] of 392 patients in the placebo group), or toxic effects of
the study drug (71 [18%] and six [2%], respectively). Of 393 patients in the ipilimumab
group, 95 (24%) received maintenance therapy, as did 62 (16%) of 396 patients in the
placebo group. Use of subsequent anticancer therapy was similar between the ipilimumab
and placebo groups (161 [41%] of 393 vs 185 [47%] of 396, respectively; appendix p 1),
with median times to first subsequent therapy of 171 (IQR 100–284) and 119 days (87–183),
respectively (data not shown).

After median follow-up of 9·9 months (IQR 4·3–16·7) in the ipilimumab group and 9·3
months (IQR 5·4–14·6) in the placebo group, 269 deaths had occurred in the ipilimumab
group and 305 in the placebo group. Median overall survival was 11·2 months (95% CI 9·5–
12·7) for ipilimumab and 10·0 months (95% CI 8·3–11·0) for placebo (HR 0·85, 95% CI
0·72–1·00; p=0·053; figure 2A). Crossover of the Kaplan-Meier survival curves occurred at
7–8 months. An assessment of the proportional hazards assumption showed that it was
violated (p=0·0031). We therefore implemented an exploratory piecewise hazard model,
which showed that the HR decreased over time: the estimated HR before 5 months was 1·46
(95% CI 1·10–1·95), from 5 to 12 months inclusive was 0·65 (95% CI 0·50–0·85), and
beyond 12 months was 0·60 (95% CI 0·43–0·86).


1-year overall survival was 46·8% (95% CI 41·8–51·8) for ipilimumab and 40·4% (95% CI
35·4–45·3) for placebo. 2-year overall survival was 26·2% (95% CI 21·0–31·4) for
ipilimumab and 15·0% (95% CI 10·6–19·4) for placebo; however, this finding should be
interpreted with caution because of the high proportion of censored patients at the time of
the database lock (180 [80%] of 225 censored patients were censored before 2 years).

The results of prespecified subgroup analyses suggest that ipilimumab might provide a
benefit for some subgroups of patients, particularly those with favourable prognostic
features (figure 2B). The largest difference was between patients with and without visceral
metastases— the presence of visceral metastases was the only prognostic feature that
showed a significant interaction with treatment (table 2). Furthermore, a prespecified
multivariate Cox analysis was done to identify covariates associated with overall survival
among the features measured at baseline. We used log adjustments to normalise the
continuous variables (alkaline phosphatase concentration and PSA). Treatment with
ipilimumab, age, log of alkaline phosphatase concentration, log of PSA concentration,

haemoglobin concentration, number of bone regions with metastases, presence of visceral
metastases, and average daily worst bone pain intensity were all associated with overall
survival after adjustment for other factors in the model (appendix p 2).

On the basis of these findings, we did a post-hoc assessment of predefined subgroups of
patients with multivariate analyses on all baseline prognostic features. These results also
suggest that ipilimumab could be most active in patients with favourable prognostic features,
particularly those with an alkaline phosphatase concentration of less than 1·5 times ULN, a
haemoglobin concentration of 110 g/L or higher, and no visceral metastases. For this subset
of patients, median overall survival was 22·7 months (95% CI 17·8–28·3) with ipilimumab
(n=146) compared with 15·8 months (13·7–19·4) with placebo (n=142; HR 0·62, 95% CI
0·45–0·86; p=0·0038; figure 3A). In all other patients—ie, a mixed population in which all
patients had at least one adverse prognostic feature—median overall survival was 6·5
months (5·7–7·9) with ipilimumab (n=253) compared with 7·3 months (6·7–7·8) with
placebo (n=258; HR 0·98, 0·81–1·19; p=0·8756; figure 3B). The results of additional
multivariate analyses done on baseline prognostic features are reported in the appendix (pp
19–22).


At data cutoff, 347 patients in the ipilimumab group had progressed or died, as had 369 in
the placebo group. Treatment with ipilimumab improved progression-free survival
compared with placebo (median 4·0 [95% CI 3·6–4·3] vs 3·1 [2·9–3·4] months; HR 0·70,
95% CI 0·61–0·82; p<0·0001; figure 4). 323 progressions or deaths had occurred before 3
months (34 censored): 139 in the ipilimumab group (102 progressions and 37 deaths) and
184 in the placebo group (171 progressions and 13 deaths). 42 additional deaths occurred
within the first 3 months after progression: 22 in the ipilimumab group and 20 in the placebo
group. Progression-free survival at 6 months was 30·7% (95% CI 26·0–35·3) for the
ipilimumab group and 18·1% (14·2–22·0) for the placebo group. Post-treatment PSA
reductions were more frequent in the ipilimumab group (appendix p 23), as assessed by the
proportion of patients with a confirmed reduction of 50% or more at any time (39/297

[13·1%, 95% CI 9·5–17·5] for ipilimumab and 16/305 [5·2%, 3·0–8·4] for placebo; appendix
p 3). The numbers of patients with a pain response were too small to draw meaningful
conclusions about differences between the groups (appendix p 3).

The safety analyses included 393 patients in the ipilimumab group and 396 patients in the
placebo group. 385 (98%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 364 (92%) in the placebo
group had an on-study adverse event; grade 3–4 on-study adverse events occurred in 232
(59%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 162 (41%) in the placebo group, and 66 (17%)
patients in the ipilimumab group and 45 (11%) in the placebo group died on study because
of adverse events. On-study adverse events of any grade that led to discontinuation of
treatment occurred in 137 (35%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 62 (16%) in the
placebo group.


Table 3 summarises the most common adverse events and immune-related adverse events; a
full list of events is reported in the appendix (pp 4–14). Drug-related adverse events of any
grade were more frequent in the ipilimumab group (295 [75%] of 393 patients) than in the
placebo group (180 [45%] of 396 patients). The most common drug-related adverse events

were immune-related: 249 (63%) patients in the ipilimumab group and 86 (22%) in the
placebo group had an immune-related adverse event of any grade, with grade 3–4 immunerelated adverse events occurring in 101 (26%) and 11 (3%) of patients, respectively
(appendix pp 4–14). The most frequently reported on-study immune-related adverse events
of any grade in the ipilimumab group were diarrhoea, pruritus, rash, colitis, increased
aspartate aminotransferase, and increased alanine aminotransferase (table 3). Diarrhoea was
the only on-study immune-related adverse event reported by more than 5% of patients in the
placebo group.

Most immune-related adverse events, including severe immune-related adverse events,
occurred during the period in which patients were given the initial four doses of study drug.
After standard ipilimumab management algorithms were followed, 91 (89%) of 102
immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group and seven (70%) of ten in the
placebo group resolved. In the ipilimumab group, the median time to onset of grade 3–4
immune-related adverse events ranged from 3·7 weeks (95% CI 2·6–6·4, for skin disorders)
to 11·1 weeks (not estimable [NE], for neurological disorders); the median time to resolution
ranged from 2·9 weeks (1·6–4·7, for gastrointestinal disorders) to 11·1 weeks (2·4–NE, for
endocrine disorders; appendix p 16).


In addition to the deaths noted above, one ipilimumab-related death (from pneumonia)
occurred more than 70 days after the last ipilimumab dose (during survival follow-up) and
thus was not regarded as an on-study event. Two patients in the ipilimumab group (one
within 70 days and the other more than 70 days after the last dose) and one in the placebo
group (within 70 days of last dose) had serious adverse events related to the study drug with
fatal outcomes (cholangitis and gastrointestinal perforation or peritonitis in the ipilimumab
group, and multiorgan failure in the placebo group). The causes of death in the remaining
patients were unknown (appendix p 17).

Five (1%) cases of gastrointestinal perforation were reported in the ipilimumab group,
whereas none were reported in the placebo group. Of these five cases, two occurred on study
and were classified as drug-related events, one of which had led to patient death, and the
other resolved. One on-study gastrointestinal perforation was not drug-related and resolved.
The two other gastrointestinal perforations were drug-related but occurred after the study
treatment was discontinued (more than 70 days from the last dose), of which one resolved,
and the other led to patient death. Among ipilimumab-treated patients, frequency and
severity of gastrointestinal adverse events were numerically similar between those who
received baseline pelvic radiotherapy and those who did not (appendix p 15).


Among treated patients, 266 (68%) deaths occurred in the ipilimumab group and 304 (77%)
in the placebo group, with most caused by disease progression (204 [77%] and 243 [80%],
respectively; appendix p 17). 81 (30%) of 266 deaths in the ipilimumab group and 62 (20%)
of 304 deaths in the placebo group occurred within 70 days of the last dose of study drug (ie,
on study). Of these deaths, 73 (90%) in the ipilimumab group and 52 (84%) in the placebo
group occurred within the first 5 months of the study. Among patients who died or were
censored on study within the first 5 months, fatal (grade 5) adverse events were reported in
56 (14%) of 393 patients in the ipilimumab group and 39 (10%) of 396 patients in the

placebo group. Of the on-study deaths, three in the ipilimumab group were related to toxic
effects of the study drug. These three deaths were caused by pulmonary embolism,
perforated diverticulitis, and performance status decrease with heart failure and respiratory
distress, respectively. Most of the other deaths were unrelated to study drug, and were
attributed mainly to disease progression; other causes of death included cardiac disorders,
respiratory disorders, and infections (appendix p 17). We noted an imbalance in baseline
prognostic features in favour of the placebo group in the subset of patients who died or were
censored within 5 months of random assignment (appendix p 18). Ipilimumab-treated
patients who died or were censored within 5 months were not more likely to have severe
immune-related adverse events than were those who lived longer than 5 months.


### Discussion

The primary objective of this phase 3 study was to assess the ability of ipilimumab to extend
overall survival compared with placebo in patients with metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer who had progressed after docetaxel chemotherapy, due to the strong
evidence of an endogenous immune response against prostate cancer cells (panel). The
proportional hazards assumption was violated in the primary analysis, in which no
difference in overall survival was noted between patients who received ipilimumab and
those who received placebo after bone-directed radiotherapy. However, an exploratory
piecewise hazard model suggested that the hazard ratio for overall survival decreased over
time, with ipilimumab seeming to be associated with better survival than placebo at later
timepoints.


Length of follow-up for the primary analysis (median of less than 1 year) precluded an
assessment of whether a durable survival benefit exists, as has been shown for ipilimumabtreated patients with advanced melanoma.[21–23] Such an effect for patients with metastatic
castration-resistant prostate cancer will be assessed in continuing survival follow-up.
Notably, median overall survival in both treatment groups was less than was predicted
during the statistical design of the study. Although the reasons for this finding are unknown,
we might have enrolled patients with worse than expected survival outcomes because of the
presence of one or more adverse prognostic features for metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer (eg, a baseline bone pain score of 4 or higher was reported in 48% of
patients). Since administration of bone-directed radiotherapy was included in both study
groups and was not controlled for in the study, its effect on overall survival or other efficacy
outcomes is unclear (although because it was balanced between both groups it is unlikely to
have had any differential effect).

Ipilimumab was associated with reductions in PSA concentration and an improvement in
progression-free survival. The proportion of patients showing a PSA response in the
ipilimumab group (13·1%) is consistent with previous findings. In a phase 1/2 study[27] in
which 50 patients received ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg with or without radiotherapy, the
proportion of patients with a PSA response was higher among the chemotherapy-naive
patients (six [26%] of 23 patients) than among the chemotherapy-pretreated patients (two

[7%] of 27 patients). These results suggest that the PSA response induced by ipilimumab
could be negatively affected by more advanced disease and previous chemotherapy.

Whether the reductions in PSA concentrations in the present study were caused, at least
partly, by the use of corticosteroids for the management of immune-related adverse events is
unclear. Moreover, the results of the present study are unable to address potential
associations between PSA reductions and incidence of immune-related adverse events,
number of bone lesions irradiated, or other efficacy outcomes (progression-free and overall
survival).

More patients in the placebo group had early disease progression (ie, before 3 months) than
in the ipilimumab group. However, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear and
will need further investigation. Although prolongation of progression-free survival in this
population with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer could be a reflection
of immune-mediated responses against prostate cancer cells, additional studies will be
necessary to assess whether the antitumour clinical activity seen in the present study is
indeed immune related, tumour specific, and consistent with the putative mechanism of
action of ipilimumab (ie, CTLA-4 blockade).


In the exploratory and post-hoc subgroup analyses, we noted an apparent overall survival
benefit for ipilimumab in a subset of patients without visceral metastases, with non-raised or
mildly raised alkaline phosphatase, and without anaemia. Thus our results suggest that
ipilimumab treatment might be effective in patients with favourable prognostic features. We
did not investigate the safety profile in patient subgroups, and further analyses will be
necessary to determine whether safety profiles differ between patient subgroups. A phase 3
[study currently in progress (CA184-095; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01057810) is assessing the](http://ClinicalTrials.gov)
efficacy and safety of ipilimumab in chemotherapy-naive, asymptomatic or minimally
symptomatic patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (patients with
visceral metastases are excluded). As such, although the CA184-095 trial was designed
before the results of the present study were known, it will allow for testing of important
hypotheses generated from our study.

In the treated study population, less than 2% of fatal adverse events in either treatment group
were regarded as drug-related, but more on-study deaths occurred overall and in the first 5
months in the ipilimumab group than in the placebo group. Treatment-related adverse events
were common and mainly consisted of immune-related adverse events, which were
generally manageable with standard ipilimumab treatment algorithms. Although
comparisons across studies are not statistically valid, the incidence and severity of immunerelated adverse events was similar to those reported in previous studies of ipilimumab
monotherapy at 10 mg/kg for melanoma,[37,38] apart from a higher incidence of
gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events attrib utable to diarrhoea and colitis, and a
lower incidence of skin immune-related adverse events. In the present study, one death in
each treatment group was attributed to an immune-related adverse event. The incidence of
drug-related on-study gastrointestinal perforation was low, and most gastrointestinal
immune-related adverse events responded to standard management, including cortico steroid
treatment. The frequency of gastrointestinal perforations in this study was consistent with
the use of ipilimumab for the treatment of advanced melanoma, for which the frequency of
gastrointestinal perforation is roughly 1%.[39] In view of the possibility that pretreatment
radiotherapy could increase the incidence of colitis associated with ipilimumab treatment,

we compared the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal adverse events in ipilimumabtreated patients who received pretreatment bone-directed radiotherapy to the pelvis and
those who did not, but detected no meaningful differences between these groups. This
finding suggests that pretreatment radiotherapy to the pelvis did not have a major effect on
gastrointestinal adverse events associated with ipilimumab in this study.

In summary, this study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival in a
population with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, we did
identify some evidence of antitumour activity with ipilimumab treatment as assessed by
prespecified secondary and exploratory endpoints, including reductions in PSA
concentration and improved progression-free survival. Other exploratory endpoints, such as
quality of life, will be reported elsewhere.
