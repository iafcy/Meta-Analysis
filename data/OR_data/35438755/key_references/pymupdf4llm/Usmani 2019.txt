### Summary
**Background Lenalidomide and dexamethasone has been a standard of care in transplant-ineligible patients with newly**
**diagnosed multiple myeloma. The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy.**
**KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab**
**in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis**
**done to assess the benefit–risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).**

**Methods KEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries**
**(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain,**
**UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma,**
**Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and**
**randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and**
**dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system. Patients received oral lenalidomide**
**25 mg on days 1–21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles, with or without**
**intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was**
**investigator-assessed because of early trial termination. Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients and**
**safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered at**
**ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863, and it is closed for accrual.**

**Findings Between Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 301 patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus**
**lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=150). On**
**July 3, 2017, the FDA decided to halt the study because of the imbalance in the proportion of death between groups. At**
**database cutoff (June 2, 2017), with a median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6), 149 patients in the pembrolizumab**
**plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had received**
**their assigned study drug. Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival**
**estimates at 6-months were 82·0% (95% CI 73·2–88·1) versus 85·0% (76·8–90·5; hazard ratio [HR] 1·22; 95% CI**
**0·67–2·22; p=0·75). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide**
**and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common**
**serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide**
**and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone**
**group. Six (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group**
**(cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocarditis, large intestine perforation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism) and**
**two (1%) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and respiratory failure).**

**Interpretation The results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit–risk profile**
**of pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with newly diagnosed,**
**previously untreated multiple myeloma. Long-term safety and survival follow-up is ongoing.**

### Introduction
Multiple myeloma, a malignancy of plasma cells,
predominantly affects older patients and is associated
with hypercalcaemia renal impairment anaemia and


bone disease.[1,2] Treatment options have evolved over the
past decade and include chemotherapy, autologous stemcell transplantation, immunomodulators, proteasome
inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies [3]

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
We did a PubMed search using the keywords “multiple
myeloma” and “PD-1” filtered by “article type: clinical trial” and
“publication dates: 01/01/2013 to 11/27/2018” with no
language restrictions, which yielded only two results relevant to
multiple myeloma (a third article was on melanoma). Both
studies involved a PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab or
nivolumab, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
myeloma and showed promising efficacy and safety. These
results raise a pertinent unanswered question regarding the use
of PD-1 inhibitors combined with immunomodulators and
dexamethasone as first-line treatment in patients with multiple
myeloma. We did another search of PubMed on Nov 27, 2018,
with the keywords, “multiple myeloma” and
“transplantation-ineligible” using the same filters and found six
results. In the phase 3 FIRST study of lenalidomide and
low-dose dexamethasone until disease progression, or
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone for 72 weeks, or
melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide for 72 weeks in
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, overall
survival was improved with continuous lenalidomide and
dexamethasone compared with with melphalan, prednisone,
and thalidomide. In the second article, the alkylator-containing
triplets, melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide, were shown
to be not superior to the alkylator-free lenalidomide and lowdose dexamethasone doublet in patients with
transplantation-ineligible multiple myeloma. These results
provide support for the choice of the comparator group in this
study, KEYNOTE-185. The third, fourth, and fifth articles
concerned regimens—such as bortezomib and dexamethasone
or bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone and
bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone—based on the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in newly diagnosed


transplantation-ineligible multiple myeloma. In the phase 3b
UPFRONT study in US community practices, all
bortezomib-containing regimens showed favourable
outcomes. The phase 3 ALCYONE study showed that the
addition of daratumumab to bortezomib, melphalan, and
prednisone led to a lower risk of disease progression or death
but an increased occurrence of grade 3 or 4 infections. The sixth
article reported results of the phase 3, SWOG SO777 study and
showed that the addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide and
dexamethasone improved survival outcomes.

**Added value of this study**
The phase 3 KEYNOTE-185 study was done to assess the
efficacy and safety of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in
transplantation-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed
multiple myeloma. Preclinical evidence reported by Gorgun and
colleagues in 2015 suggested that combination of PD-1
blockade with lenalidomide resulted in greater antitumour
activity in multiple myeloma. However, an unplanned interim
analysis of KEYNOTE-185, done at a median follow-up of
6·6 months at the request of the US FDA, showed an
unfavourable benefit–risk profile for the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination and
KEYNOTE-185 was halted.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Although KEYNOTE-185 is unlikely to change clinical practice in
light of alternative, efficacious, and safe triplet and quadruplet
treatments in this setting, it is likely to provide valuable
information to guide the design of future clinical studies
involving checkpoint inhibitors in newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma.


Standard of care for patients with transplantationineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the USA
consists of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, with or
without bortezomib.[3,4] The European Society for Medical
Oncology clinical practice guidelines recommend another
option in the non-transplantation setting: bortezomib,
melphalan, and prednisone.[5,6] Addition of daratumumab
to bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone lowered the
risk of disease progression and death in patients in the
first line setting, resulting in another efficacious and safe
treatment option.[7] Most patients with myeloma relapse;
so new treatment options for subsequent lines of therapy
are needed.
Plasma cells from most patients with multiple
myeloma express PD-L1,[8] and PD-L1 upregulation is
associated with disease relapse.[9] Combination PD-1 and
PD-L1 blockade and lenalidomide showed enhanced
effector cell-mediated multiple myeloma cytotoxicity.[10]
Thus, immune check­points might be important in
myeloma resistance and are an attractive therapeutic


target. Combination of immune checkpoint inhibition
and lenalidomide plus dexa­methasone might provide
synergistic antitumour activity in patients with multiple
myeloma.[11] The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab as
monotherapy or combined with lenalidomide and lowdose dexamethasone or pomalidomide and low-dose
dexamethasone had shown acceptable safety and
promising antitumour activity in 50% (monotherapy)
and 60% (in combination) of patients with relapsed
refractory multiple myeloma.[12–14] We hypothesised that
inhibiting the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway in patients with
treatment-naive multiple myeloma might improve
efficacy outcomes. This KEYNOTE-185 trial was done to
assess safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide
and dexa­methasone alone in patients with treatmentnaive multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of
an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the
benefit–risk profile of the combination therapy at the
request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
KEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3
trial of pembrolizumab with lenalidomide and low-dose
dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and low-dose
dexamethasone in newly diagnosed and previously un­
treated patients with multiple myeloma. Patients were
enrolled at 95 medical centres across 15 countries
(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel,
Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa,
Spain, UK, and USA; appendix 1 pp 3–5). The protocol
and its amendments were approved by the appropriate
institutional review board or independent ethics
committee. The trial was done in accordance with Good
Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed
consent.
Patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed,
treatment-naive, active multiple myeloma with
measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and
adequate organ function were enrolled. Patients had to
be ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation
because of age (≥65 years) or any clinically significant
co-existing medical condition (cardiac, renal, pulmonary,
or hepatic dysfunction) likely to have a negative effect on
their tolerability of autologous stem cell transplantation.
Patients also had to provide bone marrow biopsy samples
or aspirate material for disease assessment. Measurable
disease was defined as at least 10% bone marrow plasma
cell percentage, biopsy proven bony, or extramedullary
plasmacytoma; serum monoclonal protein concentration
of at least 5 g/L, urine monoclonal protein concentration
of at least 200 mg per 24 h or, if monoclonal protein is
not measurable, an abnormal serum free light chain
ratio with involved free light chain concentration of at
least 100 mg/L; and presence of hypercalcaemia, renal
impairment, anaemia, or bone disease. Adequate organ
function was assessed as absolute neutrophil count
more than 1000 per µL, platelets at least 75 000 per µL,
haemoglobin of at least 75 g/L, creatinine maximum
1·5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine
clearance at least 30 mL/min, total bilirubin maximum
1·5 times the ULN, aspartate transaminase and alanine
transaminase maximum 2·5 times the ULN, and
international normal­ized ratio or prothrombin time
maximum 1·5 times the ULN. Exclusion criteria were
oligosecretory myeloma; smouldering multiple mye­
loma; monoclonal gammopathy of unknown signifi­
cance; Waldenström’s macroglobulin­aemia; history of
plasma cell leukaemia; history of repeated infections or
immunosuppression; history of or active pneumonitis
necessitating steroids; active autoimmune disease
requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years; active
infections necessitating intravenous systemic treatment;
grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy; known HIV,
active hepatitis B or active hepatitis C infection; and live


vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of study
medication. Other exclusion criteria were previous
therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, antiCD137, or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
antigen-4 antibody; previous anti-myeloma therapy,
previous or current participation in another anti-mye­
loma therapy study; previous allogeneic haemo­poietic
stem cell transplantation in the past 5 years; known
hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs; known
additional malignancy requiring active treatment in past
5 years; known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders
that would interfere with study compliance; pregnant or
breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within projected
duration of the trial; unable or unwilling to undergo
thrombo­embolic prophylaxis; lactose intolerance;
invasive fungal infection; and immediate relative who is
investigational site or funder staff involved in this trial.

#### Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group
using an interactive voice or integrated web response
system (randomised allocation schedules were generated
by the funder). Randomisation was stratified by age
(<75 vs ≥75 years) and International Staging System stage
(I or II _vs III). There was no masking of treatment_
allocation in this open-label trial.

#### Procedures
Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab plus oral
lenalidomide and oral low-dose dexamethasone or
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. Lenalidomide
was given as 25 mg daily on days 1–21 and dexamethasone
as 40 mg daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day
cycles with or without pembrolizumab 200 mg
intravenously every 3 weeks. The dexamethasone dose
was 20 mg for patients older than 75 years. Patients
received study treatment until documented confirmed
disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or
withdrawal from study.
Progression-free survival and response endpoints were
investigator-assessed. Every 4 weeks, response was
assessed per International Myeloma Working Group 2011
response criteria.[15] Response was also assessed using a
full myeloma laboratory panel and calcium, creatinine,
and haemoglobin laboratory results, radio­graphy (x-ray or
MRI or CT or MRI with PET or CT with PET as clinically
indicated) for patients with extramedullary soft tissue
plasmacytomas and bone marrow biopsy specimen or
aspirate material for confirmation of complete response
or disease progression. Low-dose CT and MRI bone
surveys were allowed.
Cytogenetic analyses were done locally and not
assessed centrally; CD138 selection was not done at all
centres. Analysis of baseline lactate dehydrogenase
concentrations was not available

FDA=US Food and Drug Administration. *Reasons are not exclusive—ie, one patient can meet more than one
criterion. †One additional patient had progressive disease in the lenalidomide-dexamethasone group but is not
included in this figure because the discontinuation visit occurred after the database cutoff date. ‡All UK patients
discontinued pembrolizumab and continued standard of care treatment. The sponsor agreed to supply
lenalidomide to those patients who did not have access to it.

Patients were followed up for survival status every
12 weeks after end of study treatment and monitored
for adverse events until 30 days (90 days for serious
adverse events) after the end of study treatment.
Adverse events were graded per National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version 4.0.
The trial was to be terminated prematurely if quality or
quantity of data recording was inaccurate or incomplete


adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements was
poor, there were plans to modify or discontinue
development of pembrolizumab, or in response to a
request by the FDA or other health authority because of
safety concerns.

#### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival,
defined as the time from random group assignment to the
first documented instance of disease progression or death
from any cause, whichever occurred first. Secondary
endpoints were safety, overall survival, overall response,
duration of response, disease control, and secondary
progression-free survival (time from random­isation to
subsequent disease progression after initiation of new
anti-cancer therapy or death from any cause, whichever
occurs first, based on investigator assessment; not
reported here). Overall survival was defined as time from
randomisation to death from any cause. Overall response
was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved at
least a partial response per International Myeloma
Working Group 2011 criteria based on central review.
Duration of response was defined as the time from first
documented evidence of at least a partial response by
central review until disease progression or death. Overall
responses (complete response, very good partial response,
partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease)
were defined per the International Myeloma Working
Group 2011 criteria (appendix 1 p 15). Disease control was
defined per International Myeloma Working Group 2011
criteria as the percentage of patients who achieved
confirmed stringent complete response, complete
response, very good partial response, partial response,
minimal response, or stable disease per central review for
at least 12 weeks before any evidence of progression.
Median time to progression (time from randomisation to
first documented instance of pro­gression) was assessed.
Immune-mediated adverse events, defined as adverse
events (non-serious and serious) associated with
pembrolizumab exposure that were consistent with
immune phenomena and that had a potentially
immunological cause, were prespecified as events of
interest.

#### Statistical analysis
A sample size of 640 patients was planned. For
progression-free survival, based on 227 events, the study
had 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65 with
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone at a one-sided α
of 2·5%. The sample size calculation was based on the
following assumptions: (1) progression-free survival
follows an exponential distribution with a median of
25·5 months in the control group; (2) enrolment period is
18 months with at least 12 months’ follow-up; and
(3) cumulative dropout of participants is 2% at the end of
the first year and 5% at 4 years


-----

Hypothesis testing of objective response, progressionfree survival, and overall survival was strongly controlled
by a family-wise type I error rate of 2·5% (one-sided α).
Boundaries and the α level were established from the
actual number of events at the time of the interim
analysis using the corresponding α-spending function.[16]
A stepdown approach was used to control the type I
error rate for the testing of endpoints. The primary
endpoint (progression-free survival) was tested first;
then, if significant, the secondary endpoint (overall
survival) was tested.[16] Patients were censored for overall
survival analysis at the last date they were known to
be alive.
Progression-free survival and overall survival were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients who
did not have documented disease progression or did not
die were censored for progression-free survival analysis
at the last disease assessment. Treatment difference
between groups was assessed using the stratified logrank test. HRs and associated 95% CIs between treatment
groups were calculated using a stratified Cox proportional
hazards model with the Efron method of tie handling.
Age and International Staging System were used in the
stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model.
Additional details are in appendix 1 (p 2).
Overall responses and disease control were compared
between treatment groups using the stratified Miettinen
and Nurminen method[17] and were stratified by age and
International Staging System stage. Duration of response
was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. To analyse
duration of response, patients with missing data were
censored at the last assessment date if they responded at
the time of analysis.
One interim analysis was planned when all patients
had been enrolled and about 115 progression-free survival
events had been observed. The interim analysis was
planned for potential early detection of superiority (with
group sequential boundaries) or futility (with nonbinding bounds) of pembrolizumab plus standard of
care versus standard of care alone.
Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients
(intention-to-treat population). Safety was analysed in all
randomly assigned patients who received at least
one dose of their assigned study drug (safety population).
SAS software, version 9.4, was used for statistical
analyses. Full statistical plans to continue or stop the trial
are provided in the protocol available in appendix 2
(pp 102–15). An external data monitoring committee
monitored interim data and made re­commend­ations to
the executive oversight committee about overall risk and
benefit to trial participants. This study is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863.

#### Role of the funding source
The funder was involved in study design, data analysis
data interpretation, and writing of the report, but not
data collection All authors had access to all the data and


had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
publication.

### Results
400 patients were screened for enrolment at 95 sites in
15 countries. 90 were ineligible and nine were not
assigned to a group before the study was halted
(figure 1). Between Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017,
301 patients were randomly assigned to the
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group (n=150) group. Of these, 149 in the pembrolizumab
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in
the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group received
their assigned treatment. In the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group, 34 patients
discontinued because of adverse events and eight

because of disease progression; in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group, 20 discontinued because of
adverse events and 11 because of progression (figure 1).
The most commonly reported adverse events that led to
discon­tinuation are in appendix 1 (p 16). 156 patients
started treatment with a dose of 20 mg of dexamethasone
(78 in each group)


Changes made to the trial protocol after the start of the
study are in appendix 1 (pp 6–14). On July 3, 2017, the
FDA halted this trial on the basis of interim data
presented to the data monitoring committee, which
showed an unfavourable benefit–risk profile of
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone.[18]
Based on that decision, all patients stopped study
treatment, completed the discontinuation visit, and
moved into the long-term safety and survival follow-up
period per protocol; a long-term survival analysis is
planned. Per the FDA decision, no long-term efficacy
data will be collected. Quality-of-life assessments will not
be reported because of early trial termination. Subsequent
treatment decisions were made by the physicians per
standard of care; data will not be collected.
At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), median follow-up was
6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6). Baseline characteristics were
mostly similar between the groups, except high-risk
cytogenetics (24 [16%] of 151 in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group _vs ten [7%] of_
150 in the lena­lidomide and dexamethasone group),
anaemia (84 [56%] vs 68 of [45%]), and renal impairment
(21 [14%] vs 12 [8%]; table 1).
The primary endpoint of median progression-free
survival was not reached in either group; 24 (16%)
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group and 20 (13%) patients in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had had a
progression-free survival event at analysis. The HR for
progression-free survival was 1·22 (95% CI 0·67–2·22;
p=0·75; figure 2A). Progression-free survival was
88·5% (81·3–93·0) in the pembro­lizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus
89·3% (82·3–93·7) in the lenalidomide and dexa­metha­
sone group at 3 months and 82·0% (73·2–88·1) versus
85·0% (76·8–90·5) at 6 months. Median time to
progression was not reached in either group; six (4%) in
the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexa­
methasone group versus 11 (7%) in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group had progression events, and the
HR was 0·55 (0·20–1·50; p=0·12; figure 2B).
Median overall survival was not reached in either group;
19 (13%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide
and dexamethasone group versus nine (6%) in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group died, and the HR
was 2·06 (95% CI 0·93–4·55; p=0·97; figure 2C). 3-month
overall survival was achieved by 94·7% (89·3–97·5) of
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group versus 91·8% (85·7–95·4) in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; 6-month overall
survival was achieved by 87·2% (79·9–92·0) versus
93·9% (88·1–96·9).
Overall responses were similar between groups:
96 (64%; 95% CI 55·4–71·2) patients in the
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group and 93 (62%; 53·7–69·8) in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group achieved an overall response

(partial response or better). Disease control results were
also similar between groups: 123 (82%; 95% CI 74·3–87·3)
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group versus 127 (85%; 77·9–90·0) in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group achieved disease
control (appendix 1 p 17). Median time to response was
1·1 months (95% CI 1·0–1·9) in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group versus
1·1 months (1·0–1·3) in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group, and median duration of response
was not reached in either group (appendix 1 p 18). KaplanMeier estimates for response duration of at least 6 months
were 89% of patients in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 94% in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group.
Median treatment duration was 131·0 days
(IQR 44·0–253·0) in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexa­methasone group and 162·0 days
(83·0–246·0) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group (appendix 1 p 19). At analysis, patients had
received a median of 5·0 cycles (IQR 2·0–9·0) of
treatment in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group and 6·0 cycles (3·0–9·0) in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group.
Adverse events of any grade occurred in similar
proportions of patients in the pembrolizumab plus


lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (140 [94%]
of 149) and the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group
(133 [92%] of 145; table 2). Grade 3–5 adverse events
(107 [72%] in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group _vs 73 [50%] in the lenalidomide_
and dexamethasone group) and serious adverse events
(81 [54%] _vs 57 [39%]) occurred more frequently in the_
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group than in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group. Adverse events led to death in 13 (9%) patients in
the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexa­
methasone group versus eight (6%) patients in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and to discon­
tinuation in 44 (30%) versus 20 (14%); treatment-related
adverse events led to discontinuation in 31 (21%) versus
12 (8%) patients; adverse events resulting in treatment
interruption occurred in 91 (61%) versus 61 (42%)
patients. Adverse events that occurred more frequently
in the pembro­lizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group than in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group (≥5% difference) and serious
adverse events in at least 3% of patients are in appendix 1
(pp 20, 21). No grade 3–5 events or serious adverse
events occurred with at least a 5% difference in incidence
between groups. Immune-mediated adverse events
occurred in 48 (32%) of 149 patients in the


-----

pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group; rash (13 [9%]), hypothyroidism (11 [7%]), and
hyperthyroidism (nine [6%]) were the most common
(table 3). The minimum median time to onset of
immune-mediated adverse events was 14 days. Only
two patients had immune-mediated neutropenia and
one patient had immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.
19 [13%] of 149 patients died in the pembrolizumab
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (six because
of disease progression and 13 because of adverse events),
and nine [6%] of 145 patients died in the lenalidomide
and dexamethasone group (one because of disease
progression and eight because of adverse events). Six
(4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group (table 4). Of these deaths, cardiac arrest, cardiac
failure, myocarditis, and pneumonia were considered by
the investigator to be related to pembrolizumab (table 4).
Two (1%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group


Patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group who died were older than those in
the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (18 [95%] of
19 in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group _vs seven [78%] of nine in the_
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group were aged
≥70 years; eight [42%] of 19 vs three [33%] of nine were
aged ≥80 years) and had high-risk cytogenetics (four [21%]
of 19 vs none; appendix 1 p 22). A similar trend in age and
high-risk cytogenetics was observed among patients who
died because of an adverse event (appendix 1 p 23). The
clinical courses of patients in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group who died
because of adverse events are in appendix 1 (pp 24–38).
To assess higher risk for death in the pembrolizumab
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group, a retro­
spective, random forest analysis was done, followed by a
multivariable Cox regression analysis; however, this did
not lead to conclusive results because of the small
number of deaths (28 [14%] of the predefined 195 deaths
required) at analysis.

### Discussion
Results of this non-protocol-specified analysis, with a
median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6), showed
an increased risk for death with pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide
and dexamethasone alone Because of the imbalance in


-----

the proportion of death between groups, the data
monitoring committee halted enrolment; this was
followed by FDA termination of the study on July 3, 2017.
Consequently, data collection was incomplete and the
efficacy analysis was underpowered. 19% of the protocolspecified 227 events required for analysis of progressionfree survival and 14% of the protocol-specified 195 events
necessary for analysis of overall survival occurred by the
time of analysis. Median progression-free survival
(primary endpoint) and median overall survival were not
reached in either group. Proportions of patients with a
response were similar between groups. Treatment
exposure was truncated, with patients in either group
receiving a median of six treatment cycles at analysis;
47 [32%] of 149 patients in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 36 [25%] of
145 patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group received fewer than three cycles of treatment.
Although overlapping Kaplan-Meier curves for
progression-free survival or overall survival in this
unplanned interim analysis suggested similar pro­
gression-free or overall survival between groups, this
interpretation is limited by early study termination.
Cancer severity is associated with immune system
dysfunction; therefore, it is possible that, because of the
degree of immunodeficiency associated with multiple
myeloma, these patients might not have had an optimal
response to treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor.[19,20] Evidence
of efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with multiple
myeloma is increasing; however, patients continue to
relapse, which can partly be a consequence of immune
blockade.[21] Early intervention might be particularly
relevant for patients with multiple myeloma treated with
immune-based therapies.
The frequencies of grade 3–5 adverse events and
serious adverse events were higher in the pembrolizumab
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group than the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. More patients
discontinued because of adverse events in the
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group than in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group. The immune-mediated adverse event profile was
consistent with that previously reported for
pembrolizumab in other cancers[22–24] and with those
observed with pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed, refractory
multiple myeloma in the KEYNOTE-183 study[25] and the
study by Badros and colleagues.[14] The most common
immune-mediated adverse events were rash,
hypothyroidism, and hyper­thyroidism. 34 (23%) patients
had grade 3–5 immune-mediated adverse events, with
rash most commonly reported. One patient died because
of an immune-mediated adverse event (myocarditis).
Safety profiles of standard of care therapies have
included similar percentages of grade 3–5 adverse
events. In the ALCYONE study, patients who received
bortezomib melphalan and prednisone alone versus


with daratumumab had similar percentages of grade 3
or 4 neutropenia (137 [39%] of 354 vs 138 [40%] of 346),
thrombocytopenia (133 [38%] vs 119 [34%]), anaemia (70

[20%] vs 55 [16%]), and infections (52 [15%] vs 80 [23%]).[7]
Patients in the SWOG S0777 study who received
lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone versus with
bortezomib also had similar percentages of grade 3 or 4
blood adverse events (70% _vs 73%) or bone marrow_
adverse events (34% _vs 41%), grade 3 infections_
(29% _vs 29%), and grade 3 neurological adverse events_
(21% vs 76%).[26] Notably, in our study, more patients died
in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexa­
metha­sone group than in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group. More deaths occurred because
of disease progression in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group than in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. Additionally,
number of deaths attributed to adverse events was
numerically different between groups; however, no
specific adverse event was exacerbated in patients who
received pembro­lizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone. Age and unfavourable risk factors might
have contributed to increased toxicity and early (3-month)
mortality of 8% of patients in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 5% in the
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. These early
mortality results are higher than the 4-month mortality
results reported in a previous study for patients with
myeloma who were treated with lenalidomide 25 mg on
days 1–21 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1–4, 9–12,
and 17–20 of a 28-day cycle (high dose, 5% mortality) or
lenalidomide on the same schedule and dexamethasone
40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle (low dose,
<1% mortality).[27] The authors noted that the increased
percentage of deaths in the high-dose cohort, especially
in the first 4 months, might have been related to toxicity
in older patients.[27] In our study, the starting dose of
dexamethasone was reduced to 20 mg for 156 patients
who were older than 75 years. Although the lenalidomide
25 mg dose was established in the dose-confirmation
phase of the KEYNOTE-023 study,[13] reducing the dose to
15 mg in older patients should be considered, based on
the increased frequency of adverse events observed in
this study.
To understand the imbalance of proportion of deaths
between groups, baseline characteristics were assessed
among patients who died during the study. More patients
who died in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group than in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group were aged at least 70 years (95% in
the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone
group _vs 78% in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone_
group) and had high cytogenetic risk (21% _vs 0)._
Furthermore, among all study patients, there was an
imbalance of disease severity and manifestation at
baseline, whereby patients in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had more

advanced disease than those in the lenalidomide and
dexamethasone group (29% had stage III disease vs 21% in
the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; 14% _vs 8%_
had renal impairment). According to the International
Myeloma Working Group recommendations, cytogenetic
abnormalities by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation, ISS
stage, and renal failure are some of the factors used for risk
stratification in patients with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma.[28] It is plausible that the imbalance between
groups of risk factors such as ISS stage III and high
cytogenetic risk, which are associated with poor prognosis,[28]
contributed to the incidence of early progression and
subsequent death. These risk factors might have led to the
observed differences in treatment-related adverse events
and deaths in this study. These results suggest that the
observed imbalance in proportion of deaths between
groups might have resulted from diverse non-treatmentrelated adverse events or differ­ences in patient baseline
characteristics. This study was limited by the ad-hoc
unplanned nature of the analysis. Enrolment was ongoing
at more than 100 international sites at the time the trial
was prematurely terminated. Subsequent longer-term
follow-up efficacy data were not collected, probably leading
to imbalances in the reported results.
In conclusion, an imbalance was observed between
groups in the number of deaths. However, the shortened
follow-up time resulting from premature study term­
ination rendered this interim analysis underpowered
and inconclusive. Future study designs testing PD-1
inhibitors with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in
multiple myeloma should consider excluding unfit
patients, patients older than 75 years, and patients with
high tumour burden or tumour staging. Other treatment
combinations should also be assessed and excluding
dexamethasone might reduce toxicity and improve
T-cell activation. Stratification of patients by renal
function and ECOG performance status could also be
considered in future study designs.
