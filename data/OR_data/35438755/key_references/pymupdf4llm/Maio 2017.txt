### Summary
**Background New therapeutic strategies for malignant mesothelioma are urgently needed. In the DETERMINE study,**
**we investigated the effects of the cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) monoclonal antibody**
**tremelimumab in patients with previously treated advanced malignant mesothelioma.**

**Methods** **DETERMINE was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done at 105 study centres across**
**19 countries in patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma who had progressed after**
**one or two previous systemic treatments for advanced disease. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with**
**Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease as defined in the modified**
**Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma or RECIST version 1.1**
**for peritoneal mesothelioma. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) in blocks of three, stratified by European**
**Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer status (low risk vs high risk), line of therapy (second line vs third**
**line), and anatomic site (pleural vs peritoneal), by use of an interactive voice or web system, to receive intravenous**
**tremelimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo every 4 weeks for 7 doses and every 12 weeks thereafter until a treatment**
**discontinuation criterion was met. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.**
**Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. The trial is ongoing but no longer**
**recruiting participants, and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374.**

**Findings Between May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 571 patients were randomly assigned to receive tremelimumab**
**(n=382) or placebo (n=189), of whom 569 patients received treatment (two patients in the tremelimumab group were**
**excluded from the safety population because they did not receive treatment). At the data cutoff date (Jan 24, 2016),**
**307 (80%) of 382 patients had died in the tremelimumab group and 154 (81%) of 189 patients had died in the placebo**
**group. Median overall survival in the intention-to-treat population did not differ between the treatment groups:**
**7·7 months (95% CI 6·8–8·9) in the tremelimumab group and 7·3 months (5·9–8·7) in the placebo group (hazard**
**ratio 0·92 [95% CI 0·76−1·12], p=0·41). Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in**
**246 (65%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 91 (48%) of 189 patients in the placebo group; the most**
**common were dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs 27 [14%] patients in the placebo group),**
**diarrhoea (58 [15%]** **_vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%]_** **_vs none). The most common serious adverse events were_**
**diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients in the tremelimumab group** **_vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group), dyspnoea_**
**(29 [8%] vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%] vs none). Treatment-emergent events leading to death occurred in 36** **(9%)**
**of 380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of 189 in the placebo group; those leading to the death of**
**more than one patient** **were mesothelioma (three [1%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs two [1%] in the placebo**
**group), dyspnoea (three [1%]** **_vs two [1%]); respiratory failure (one [<1%]_** **_vs three [2%]), myocardial infarction_**
**(three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%] patients vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%] vs one [<1%]), and colitis**
**(two [<1%]** **_vs none). Treatment-related adverse events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in the_**
**tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group. The causes of death were lung infection in one patient,**
**intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin**
**ulcer in one patient.**

**Interpretation Tremelimumab did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with placebo in patients with**
**previously treated malignant mesothelioma. The safety profile of tremelimumab was consistent with the known**
**safety profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors. Investigations into whether immunotherapy combination regimens can provide**
**greater efficacy than monotherapies in malignant mesothelioma are ongoing.**

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
We searched PubMed for reports published in English from Jan 1,
2006, to Dec 31, 2016, using the terms “mesothelioma”,
“anti-CTLA-4”, and “immunotherapy”, and limited our results to
clinical trials. There are currently no approved second-line
therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory malignant
mesothelioma; thus, new treatments are urgently needed.
Therapeutic blockade of the immune checkpoint
cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) has been
shown to result in durable clinical benefit in melanoma and thus
could be efficacious for other indications, including
mesothelioma. In a preliminary study of tremelimumab
(15 mg/kg every 90 days) in malignant mesothelioma,
early evidence of clinical activity was recorded. However,
retrospective data from studies of melanoma suggested that this
dosing schedule might have resulted in tremelimumab
underexposure. As such, an intensified dosing schedule of
tremelimumab (10 mg/kg every 4 weeks for seven doses
followed by the same dose every 12 weeks thereafter) was then
investigated and showed promising antitumour activity and an
acceptable safety profile in mesothelioma. These data led to the
assessment of tremelimumab in patients with malignant
mesothelioma in a randomised setting in this phase 2b trial.


**Added value of this study**
This Article is the first publication on DETERMINE, a randomised
clinical trial investigating the antitumour activity and safety of
tremelimumab versus placebo in patients with previously
treated malignant mesothelioma. In this study, tremelimumab
did not significantly prolong overall survival compared with
placebo. No clinically meaningful differences in progression-free
survival or the proportion of patients achieving objective
responses were recorded between the treatment groups.
The safety data were consistent with those reported previously
for tremelimumab, as well as with other CTLA-4 inhibitors in
other tumour types.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Our results provide further information about the clinical utility
of anti-CTLA agents in malignant mesothelioma and show that
patients with malignant mesothelioma do not derive clinical
benefit from single-agent tremelimumab. Preliminary studies
investigating other checkpoint inhibitors (eg, anti-PD-1/PD-L1)
have shown early signs of clinical activity with an acceptable
safety profile. Ongoing studies are investigating whether
combinations of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents will
be efficacious in patients with malignant mesothelioma.


### Introduction
Malignant mesothelioma is an asbestos-related tumour
that mainly originates in the pleural and peritoneal
mesothelial surfaces.[1] Most cases are pleural malignant
mesothelioma, with a smaller proportion of patients
presenting with primary peritoneal disease.[2] Cisplatin and
pemetrexed combination therapy is the recommended
first-line treatment for advanced pleural malignant
mesothelioma.[3] Although no first-line treatments have
been approved for advanced peritoneal disease, cisplatin
and pemetrexed are also commonly used in this
population.[3] The addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin and
pemetrexed combination therapy has been shown to
significantly improve overall survival compared with
cisplatin and pemetrexed alone in newly diagnosed pleural
malignant mesothelioma.[4] No therapies have shown
survival benefit as second-line treatments for relapsed or
refractory disease and consequently no agents have been
approved for use following progression on first-line therapy.

Immunotherapy-based immune checkpoint blockade
has shown promising antitumour activity across various
types of cancer.[5] Malignant mesothelioma is associated
with lymphocyte infiltration,[6] including regulatory T cells
and inhibitory cytokines that induce a highly immuno­
suppressive environment within the tumour.[7] Thus,
a rationale exists for investigating immunotherapy-based
regimens in advanced malignant mesothelioma.

Cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)
is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells that
reduces the amplitude of CD28-mediated T-cell activation


by competitively binding to CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2)
ligands.[8] Blockade of CTLA-4 enhances T-cell activation
and might be associated with antitumour immune
responses. The CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab has been
shown to lead to a durable survival benefit in patients
with metastatic melanoma.[9]

Tremelimumab is a selective human immunoglobulin
G2 monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4[10] that promotes
T-cell activity but does not deplete regulatory T cells.[11]
Tremelimumab showed clinical activity in two
investigator-initiated phase 2, open-label, single-arm,
single-centre studies, each of which enrolled 29 patients
with chemotherapy-resistant advanced malignant
mesothelioma.[12,13] In the first trial (MESOT-TREM-2008),[12]
tremelimumab was given at a dose of 15 mg/kg
every 90 days; median progression-free survival was
6·2 months (95% CI 1·3–11·1) and median overall
survival was 10·7 months (0·0–21·9). However,
a retrospective analysis of data from patients with
melanoma suggested that this dose might have led to
underexposure to tremelimumab[14] and therefore the
second trial (MESOT-TREM-2012)[13] used an intensified
dosing schedule (10 mg/kg given every 4 weeks for
six doses, then every 12 weeks). The clinical activity of
tremelimumab was encouraging, with four (14%)
immune-related partial responses, immune-related
progression-free survival of 6·2 months (95% CI
5·7–6·7), median overall survival of 11·3 months
(3·4–19·2), and 1 year survival of 48·3% (30·1–66·5).[13]
Tremelimumab also had a manageable tolerability


-----

profile,[13] consistent with that reported in other tumour
types.[15] These data led to further assessment of
tremelimumab in a randomised setting in patients with
advanced malignant mesothelioma.

In this Article, we present results from the DETERMINE
trial, which compared tremelimumab with placebo in
patients with unresectable pleural or peritoneal malignant
mesothelioma after progression on one or two previous
systemic treatments for advanced disease.

### Methods
#### Study design and participants
DETERMINE was an international, multicentre, random­
ised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial done
at 105 study centres in 19 countries (appendix pp 19–22).
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with
histologically or cytologically confirmed unresectable
pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma that had
progressed after one or two previous systemic treatments
for advanced disease, as confirmed by investigators (who
also confirmed the stage of disease). Progression at
inclusion was investigator-determined based on standard
clinical criteria such as evidence of radiological or clinical
progression. Previous systemic treatment must have
included a first-line pemetrexed (or other anti-folate)based regimen in combination with a platinum agent; for
patients in whom pemetrexed was contraindicated, not
tolerated, or not an approved therapy (eg, those with
peritoneal mesothelioma), previous treatment with a firstline platinum-based regimen was required. Additionally,
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 0 or 1 and measurable disease,
defined as at least one measurable lesion that could be
accurately assessed at baseline by CT or MRI and suitable
for repeated measurements (in accordance with modified
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST]
version 1.0 for pleural mesothelioma[16] or RECIST
version 1.1 for peritoneal mesothelioma[17]), were also
required for enrolment. Patients with any histological
subtypes of malignant mesothelioma (epithelioid,
sarcomatoid, and biphasic) were allowed to participate.
Eligible patients had to have adequate bone marrow,
hepatic, and renal function measured within 14 days
before randomisation, which were defined as platelet
count of at least 75 000 platelets per mL, an absolute
neutrophil count of at least 1000 cells per mL, haemoglobin
of at least 9 g/dL, total bilirubin up to 1·5-times the upper
limit of normal (ULN; except for patients with Gilbert’s
syndrome [>5 times ULN] or those with liver metastasis,
who had to have baseline total bilirubin ≤3·0 mg/dL);
aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase
up to three times the ULN (≤5 times ULN for patients
with liver metastasis); and serum creatinine up to
2·0 mg/dL or calculated creatinine clearance of at least
50 mL/min as calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault
equation. Negative screening test results for HIV and
hepatitis A B and C were also required for eligibility


Patients were excluded if they had failed more than two
previous systemic treatments for advanced malignant
mesothelioma, or had received any previous monoclonal
antibody against CTLA-4, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1),
or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Patients who
received chemotherapy or radiotherapy less than 2 weeks
before randomisation and those who were receiving
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive
medications, or with a condition that necessitated chronic
use of corticosteroids, were also excluded.

Patients were not eligible for the study if they had a
history of chronic inflammatory or autoimmune disease
with symptomatic disease within 3 years before
randomisation; active, untreated CNS metastasis; history
of other malignancy unless the patient had been diseasefree for at least 3 years; active or history of diverticulitis,
inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome,
coeliac disease or other serious gastrointestinal chronic
conditions associated with diarrhoea; active or history of
systemic lupus erythematosis or Wegener’s granulo-​
matosis; or a history of sarcoidosis syndrome. Additional
inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the
appendix (p 2).

The study was done in accordance with the ethical
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
International Council on Harmonization guidelines on
Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol was reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Board or
independent ethics committee at all participating centres.
The full trial protocol is available online.

All patients provided written informed consent to
participate.

#### Randomisation and masking
By use of an interactive voice or web response system,
patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to treatment with
tremelimumab or matching placebo. Randomisation was
stratified by European Organisation for Research and
Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) status (low risk _vs high_
risk),[18] line of therapy (second line _vs third line), and_
anatomic site (pleural _vs peritoneal). Enrolment of_
patients without previous first-line pemetrexed-based
treatment was capped at 20%. Treatment was allocated in
blocks of three via a schedule generated by Perceptive
Informatics (Nottingham, UK) who used a computerised
randomised list generator. Patients, treating physicians,
and representatives of the study funder were masked to
study treatment assignment. The interactive voice or web
response system was used to assign the investigational
product kit numbers to patients, and tremelimumab and
placebo were identically labelled and indistinguishable in
appearance.

#### Procedures
Patients received tremelimumab (intravenous infusion
at 10 mg/kg) or matching placebo, every 4 weeks
for seven doses as induction treatment followed by

maintenance dosing every 12 weeks until a treatment
discontinuation criterion was met. Permanent dis­
continuation criteria included withdrawal of patient
consent, loss to follow-up, pregnancy or intent to become
pregnant, patient non-compliance, initiation of alternative
anticancer therapy, confirmed disease progression, adverse
event or laboratory abnormality contraindicating further
dosing or two consecutive doses missed due to ongoing
treatment-related adverse event (appendix p 2), and
administration of infliximab or another tumour necrosis
factor α inhibitor. No dose reductions were allowed.
Criteria for skipping the next scheduled dose included
ongoing grade 2 treatment-related laboratory abnormalities
or toxicities (appendix p 2), as assessed with National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (CTCAE). Persistent CTCAE grade 1
treatment-related toxicities (duration >10 days) were
managed in the same way as CTCAE grade 2 toxicities. All
treatment-related toxicities had to be resolved to grade 1 or
lower before dosing could be resumed at the next
scheduled dose.

Clinical laboratory assessments included serum
chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis and were done at
baseline, every 4 weeks during the induction period,
every 6 weeks during weeks 25–61, and every 3 months
thereafter, and at the end of treatment and every 30 days
through to 90 days after the last dose. Adverse events
were recorded continuously from the first dose to 90 days
after the last dose of tremelimumab or placebo, graded in
accordance with CTCAE version 3.0.

Tumour imaging assessments were done at baseline and
every 3 months during the induction dosing period, every
6 weeks during weeks 25–61, and every 3 months
thereafter, until confirmed objective disease progression,
irrespective of whether or not the patient discontinued
study drug. A modified version of RECIST for
mesothelioma[16] was used to assess pleural mesothelioma
via CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and
peritoneal mesothelioma was assessed with RECIST v1.1.[17]

Given that an initial increase in tumour burden
or the appearance of new lesions could precede
immunotherapy-induced tumour regression,[19] patients
initially assessed as having progressive disease on RECIST
criteria for mesothelioma, in the absence of significant
clinical deterioration warranting discontinuation of study
treatment, were to continue treatment and receive a
confirmatory scan at least 4 weeks later.[19] If the tumour
burden at the confirmatory scan was more than 20% larger
than the tumour burden at the initial scan showing
progressive disease, the patient was deemed to have
confirmed progressive disease and was to be discontinued
from study treatment. However, if the tumour burden at
the confirmatory scan was within 20% of the tumour
burden at the initial scan showing progressive disease, the
patient was deemed to have stable disease and was to
continue treatment until the next scheduled scan 3 months
after the initial progressive disease Any subsequent


scheduled tumour assessment visit showing that the
tumour burden was more than 20% larger than the tumour
burden at the initial scan showing progressive disease was
regarded as confirmed progressive disease, and the patient
was to be discontinued from study treatment.

Patient-reported outcomes were assessed with the
Lung Cancer Symptom Scale-mesothelioma (LCSSMeso; for disease-related symptoms and health-related
quality of life), Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-sf;
for pain), and EQ-5D 3 level version (EQ-5D-3L; for
health status), and collected with an electronic patientreported outcome device. The BPI-sf questionnaire was
collected before any study procedures at screening, at or
before study visits during the induction and
maintenance treatment periods, and at the end of
treatment. An exception to this was for the BPI-sf worst
pain score item, which was collected daily. The LCSSMeso questionnaire was collected at screening, daily
during the induction and maintenance treatment
periods, and at the end of treatment. Other assessments
included pharmacokinetics and anti-tremelimumab
antibodies, which were measured with a validated
electrochemiluminescence assay on a Meso Scale
Discovery platform (Meso Scale Diagnostics, Rockville,
MD, USA).

All patients were followed up for safety at 30, 60, and
90 days (or within 3 days of each timepoint) after the last
dose of tremelimumab or placebo or at the time of initiation
of new systemic anticancer treatment. After 90 days, only
patients with treatment-related serious adverse events were
followed up for safety. All patients were followed up for
survival every 3 months (or within 14 days of each
timepoint) until the end of the study.

#### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival, which was
defined as the time from randomisation until death from
any cause. For patients who were alive at the time of data
cutoff for the primary analysis or lost to follow-up, overall
survival was censored on the last date when patients
were known to be alive.

Secondary endpoints were 18-month overall survival
(proportion of patients alive at 18 months, as estimated
with the Kaplan-Meier method), disease control
(proportion of patients with a best response of complete
response, partial response, or stable disease for at least
12 weeks’ duration measured from date of random­
isation; this endpoint was prospectively added as an
additional variable to the statistical analysis protocol
before the database lock and unblinding of the study)
and durable disease control (proportion of patients with
best response of complete response, partial response,
or stable disease for at least 6 months measured from
the date of randomisation), progression-free survival
(time from randomisation to the first record of disease
progression or death from any cause [whichever
occurred first] censored at the last tumour assessment


-----

date for patients who were alive and progression-free at
the time of data cutoff), proportion of patients achieving
an objective response (complete response or partial
response), duration of response (time from first
documen­tation of objective response [complete
response or partial response] to the first documented
disease progression or death from any cause, whichever
occurred first), patient-reported outcomes, pharmaco­
kinetics (not reported in this Article), immunogenicity
of tremelimumab, and safety and tolerability. The two
key patient-reported outcome endpoints were time to
deterioration in worst pain (from BPI-sf) and time to
deterioration of disease-related symptoms (using the
symptom burden index [SBI] from LCSS-Meso). The
evaluation of these endpoints is described in detail in
the appendix (p 2).

Safety endpoints included adverse events and serious
adverse events, changes from baseline in clinical laboratory
assessments, electrocardiogram results, and vital signs. To
aid detection of important toxicities or reactions that are
associated with the anti-CTLA-4 drug class (ie, ipilimumab),
we analysed the following categories of adverse events
of special interest: diarrhoea; colitis or enterocolitis;
endocrinopathy; dermatitis; hepatitis or hepatic toxicity;
hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, or infusion
reactions; pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease; neuro­
pathy or neuromuscular toxic effects; pancreatitis; and
renal failure or nephritis (appendix pp 2–3).

Exploratory objectives were: to estimate and compare
durable disease control, progression-free survival, pro­
portion of patients achieving an objective response, and
duration of response based on immune-related response
criteria between the two treatment arms; to examine
health-related quality of life, disease-related symptoms,
pain, and health status in patients with durable clinical
activity; and to examine biomarkers and their association
with tremelimumab treatment and clinical outcome. The
results of these analyses are not reported in this Article.

#### Statistical analysis
The formal statistical analysis for this trial was to test the
following hypotheses: H0, that there was no difference
between tremelimumab and placebo; and H1, that there
was a difference between tremelimumab and placebo.
The trial was amended from a 180-patient phase 2 trial
(80% power with a two-sided α of 0·20) because of a
review of data from two single-arm, investigator-initiated
phase 2 studies in mesothelioma.[12,13] At the time of this
protocol amendment (Jan 23, 2014), neither the funder
nor the investigators were aware of treatment allocation
within the study because of the double-blind design. The
study had randomised 107 patients prior to this
amendment and written approval was obtained from the
appropriate Institutional Review Board or Independent
Ethics Committee before the implementation of the
amendment. After the amendment, the planned sample
size of the study was changed to about 564 patients


(randomised 2:1), on the basis of a group sequential
design with two planned interim analyses. The sample
size and power calculations were based on simulations
under a nonproportional hazard model that accounted for
the potential delayed treatment effect for immunotherapy.
Assuming an exponential distribution of overall survival
with a median time of 7 months for placebo and a
4-month delayed effect (ie, hazard ratio [HR] of 1 for the
first 4 months and HR of 0·56 thereafter) for
tremelimumab, 456 overall survival events (deaths) were
needed to provide approximately 90% power and to
control the overall two-sided α of 0·05 with two planned
interim analyses. Under these assumptions, the
1000 simulations generated a mean overall HR of 0·71
and a median overall survival of 7·0 months for the
placebo group and 9·3 months for the tremelimumab
group.

The primary endpoint of overall survival was compared
between the two treatment groups in the intention-totreat population (all randomised patients) via a stratified
log-rank test. We estimated the HR of tremelimumab
versus placebo and the 95% CI with a stratified Cox
regression model. The planned stratification factors were
anatomic site, EORTC status, and line of therapy.
However, because of the low percentage of randomised
patients with peritoneal malignant mesothelioma (<5%),
only the stratification variables of EORTC status and line
of therapy were included within the final stratified
statistical analysis, as prespecified in the statistical
analysis plan, before unblinding and database lock.
A hierarchical gate-keeping strategy was applied in this
study, in which hypotheses were tested in a predefined
order, where overall survival (primary endpoint) was
tested first. The other hypotheses were then tested in the
multiple testing procedure with an α-exhaustive recycling
strategy.[20] We used the intention-to-treat population for
the primary analysis of all secondary efficacy endpoints.
We compared overall survival at 18 months, estimated
with the Kaplan-Meier method, between the
two treatment groups via a normal approximation under
a com­plementary log-log transformation,[21] stratified by
EORTC status and line of therapy. We analysed
progression-free survival (based on investigatordetermined response data) with the same methods as for
the primary endpoint. We estimated 95% CIs for durable
disease control, disease control, and the proportion of
patients achieving an objective response for each
treatment group using an exact probability method.
Sensitivity analyses for overall survival included
assessment of the pattern of censoring between the two
treatment groups. We generated a Kaplan-Meier plot of
time to censoring in which the censoring and event flags
were reversed. Additionally, we did subgroup analyses of
overall survival (prespecified subgroups were EORTC
status [low risk _vs_ high risk], line of therapy [second _vs_
third] anatomic site [pleural vs peritoneal], age [<65 years
_vs ≥65 years] race [white vs not white] C-reactive protein_

level [≤1·5 _vs_ >1·5 times ULN), sex [male _vs_ female],
histology [epithelioid, sarcomatoid, and biphasic] and
country [USA vs non-USA]) and a global interaction test
at the 0·1 level of significance for the Cox regression
model to establish whether there were any potential
treatment-by-covariate interactions.

We evaluated patient-reported outcomes of time to
deterioration in worst pain (from BPI-sf) in the intentionto-treat population subset who reported asymptomatic or
minimal pain at baseline and who did not take opioids
within 4 weeks before randomisation, and evaluated time
to deterioration of disease-related symptoms (SBI from
LCSS-Meso) in patients with pleural mesothelioma in the
intention-to-treat population. We analysed the patientreported outcome time to deterioration endpoints using
the same methods as for the primary endpoint.

Tolerability and safety were assessed by summarising
adverse events and serious adverse events occurring
from the first dose of study drug to 90 days after the last
dose, electrocardiogram results, ECOG performance
status, vital signs, and laboratory assessments (including
haematology and blood chemistry) during the study. We
based the tolerability and safety analyses on the safety
population (all patients who received at least one dose of
study drug), with analysis by treatment group and for all
patients combined. The safety analysis was descriptive
in nature and we made no formal statistical
comparisons.

Two interim analyses were planned: the first to assess
futility and superiority of overall survival; the second to
assess superiority of overall survival only. The first
interim analysis was planned to be done after 128 overall
survival events (deaths) had occurred in the first
180 patients randomised, with the futility analysis based
on these 180 patients and superiority analysis based on
all patients randomised up to that time. The second
interim analysis was planned to be done after 342 overall
survival events had been observed. An independent data
monitoring committee of external experts reviewed the
data and informed the funder whether the interim
boundaries were crossed. The futility boundary at the
first interim analysis was based on the predictive power
being less than 10% (corresponding roughly to an HR
of 1). The interim and final efficacy boundaries were
based on O’Brien−Fleming type flexible α-spending
methods. The actual efficacy boundaries at the
two interim and final analyses were to be adjusted
according to the actual number of observed events at
each analysis so that the overall type I error was controlled
at the two-sided 0·05 level by use of ADDPLAN
version 6.0 (appendix p 5).

We did all data analyses with the SAS system version 9.3
in a UNIX environment. This study is registered with
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01843374.

study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpret­
ation, and preparation of the report, and gave approval to
submit for publication. All authors had full access to the

### Results
Between May 17, 2013, and Dec 4, 2014, 658 patients were
enrolled into the DETERMINE study. Trial accrual was
very rapid. The independent data monitoring committee
recommended the study continue at both interim
analyses because futility (first interim analyses only

[predictive power <10%]) and superiority boundaries
were not met. As such, we present the final analyses of
results. At the time of the final analysis data cutoff
(Jan 24 2016) 571 patients had been randomly assigned

to tremelimumab (n=382) or placebo (n=189) and were
included in the intention-to-treat analysis set and
analysed for overall survival (figure 1); 87 patients were
not assigned to treatment (ie, were excluded from the
intention-to-treat analysis) because of screening failure
(n=66), consent withdrawal (n=19), or other reasons
(n=2). 569 patients received study treatment, including
380 who received tremelimumab and 189 who received
placebo, and were included in the safety analysis
set. Patient demographics and baseline characteristics
were balanced across the two treatment groups, with
most patients being elderly (median age 66·0 years

[IQR 60·0–72·0]) and male (434 [76%] of 571 patients). Of
the 571 patients randomised, 545 (95%) had pleural
malignant mesothelioma, 475 (83%) had epithelioid
histology, and 530 (93%) had stage III or IV disease at
study entry (table 1). The median number of doses was
3·0 (IQR 2·0–5·0) and median dose intensity was 100%
(75·7–100·0) with tremelimumab and 100% (90·3–100·0)
with placebo. Median treatment duration was 57·0 days
(IQR 29·0–113·5) in the tremelimumab group and
58·0 days (30·0–140·0) in the placebo group. 61 (16%) of
the 382 patients assigned to tremelimumab remained
on-study (six patients still receiving trial treatment) at
data cutoff versus 25 (13%) of 189 patients in the placebo
group (three patients still receiving trial treatment). The
most common reason for treatment discontinuation was
disease progression (187 [49%] of 382 patients in the
tremelimumab group and 130 [69%] of 189 patients in
the placebo group). Death was the most common reason
for study withdrawal (302 [79%] of 382 patients in the
tremelimumab group and 150 [79%] of 189 patients in the
placebo group).

At data cutoff, 461 patients had died: 307 (80%) of 382 in
the tremelimumab group and 154 (82%) of 189 in the
placebo group (appendix p 6). Median overall survival did
not differ significantly between the treatment groups:
it was 7·7 months (95% CI 6·8–8·9) in the tremelimumab

Overall HR derived from a stratified Cox analysis of overall survival in the intention-to-treat population, stratified by
EORTC status and line of therapy; subgroups were derived from unadjusted Cox analysis. Shading represents the size
of 95% CI for the overall intention-to-treat population. HRs are not presented if there were fewer than ten events in

group and 7·3 months (5·9–8·7) in the placebo group
(HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·76−1·12, p=0·41; figure 2). A plot of
the complementary log-log of the estimated survivor
function versus log(time) by treatment group showed
little evidence of non-proportional hazards, since lines
on the plot were reasonably parallel and crossover was
not extensive (appendix p 17). Additionally, formal testing
with a model including terms for treatment and a
treatment time-dependent variable of the proportionality
assumption, as well as the stratification factors of EORTC
status and line of therapy, provided a p value of 0·996.

Overall survival was generally consistent across
prespecified subgroups, including treatment line, sex,
age, and EORTC status, as well as exploratory post-hoc
subgroups (disease stage at study entry; figure 3). The
global interaction test for the two stratification factors
(EORTC status and line of therapy) was not significant at
the 10% level (p=0·97).

Because a hierarchical gate-keeping strategy was
applied and the primary endpoint was not met, statistical
significance could not be assessed for the other


endpoints. However, point estimates, CIs and p values
are presented for information. Overall survival at
18 months did not differ between treatment groups
(17·4% [95% CI 13·4–21·8] in the tremelimumab group
and 18·2% [12·7–24·5] in the placebo group; HR 1·01

[95% CI 0·79−1·29], p=0·926). We detected no clinically
meaningful differences in progression-free survival
between tremelimumab and placebo (appendix p 18).
Objective responses were achieved by 17 (4·5%, 95% CI
2·6–7·0) of 382 patients receiving tremelimumab
(table 2), all of which were partial responses. In the
placebo group, two (1·1%, 0·1–3·8) of 189 patients
achieved an objective response, both of which were also
partial responses. The median duration of response was
4·8 months (95% CI 2·6–8·3) in the tremelimumab
group and 5·6 months (2·8–8·3) in the placebo group.
In the tremelimumab group, 106 (27·7%, 23·3–32·5) of
382 patients achieved disease control, compared with
41 (21·7%, 16·0–28·3) of 189 patients in the placebo
group. 64 (16·8%, 95% CI 13·1–20·9) of 389 patients in
the tremelimumab group and 22 (11·6%, 7·4–17·1) of
189 patients in the placebo group had durable disease
control. Patient-reported outcome analyses are described
in the appendix (p 4), but interpretation of patientreported outcome data was limited by the absence of data
collection beyond the end of treatment or discontinuation.
The incidence of anti-tremelimumab antibodies was low
(appendix p 4).

Subsequent anticancer treatment was received by
93 (24%) of 382 patients in the tremelimumab group and
58 (31%) of 189 patients in the placebo group (appendix
p 7). Most of these patients received subsequent
chemotherapy (90 [24%] patients in the tremelimumab
group and 57 [30%] in the placebo group). No patients in
either group received subsequent immune checkpoint
inhibitors, such as anti-PD-L1/PD-1 agents.

Treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were
reported in 364 (96%) of 380 patients in the tremelimumab
group and 179 (95%) of 189 patients who received placebo.
Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or worse
occurred in 246 (65%) patients in the tremelimumab
group and 91 (48%) patients in the placebo group (table 3;
appendix pp 8–12). The most common of these were
dyspnoea (34 [9%] patients in the tremelimumab group vs
27 [14%] patients in the placebo group), diarrhoea
(58 [15%] _vs one [<1%]), and colitis (26 [7%]_ _vs none)._
Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred in
278 (73%) patients in the tremelimumab group and
101 (53%) patients in the placebo group. Grade 3 or worse
treatment-related adverse events occurred in 110 (29%)
patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) patients
in the placebo group. The most common of these were
diarrhoea (55 [15%] patients in the tremelimumab group
_vs one [<1%] patient in the placebo group) and colitis_
(25 [7%] _vs none). Concomitant steroid medication was_
administered to 237 (62%) patients in the tremelimumab
group and 57 (30%) patients who received placebo


-----

Across both treatment groups, 303 (53%) of 569 patients
had serious adverse events; 218 (57%) of 380 patients in
the tremelimumab group and 85 (45%) of 189 patients
receiving placebo (appendix pp 13–15). The most common
serious adverse events (those present in ≥5% of patients
in either group) were diarrhoea (69 [18%] patients
receiving tremelimumab vs one (<1%) receiving placebo),
dyspnoea (29 [8%] _vs 24 [13%]), and colitis (24 [6%]_ _vs_
none).

Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to study
treatment discontinuation occurred in 104 (27%) of
380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 10 (5%) of
189 patients in the placebo group. The most common
adverse events leading to discontinuation (those occurring
in ≥1% of patients in the tremelimumab group) were
diarrhoea (49 [13%] patients receiving tremelimumab _vs_
one [<1%] patient receiving placebo), colitis (16 [4%] _vs_
none), and vomiting (four [1%] _vs none). Treatment-_
related adverse events leading to study treatment
discontinuation occurred in 88 (23%) patients in the
tremelimumab group and 4 (2%) patients in the placebo
group. The most common treatment-related adverse
events leading to discontinuation were diarrhoea
(49 [13%] patients receiving tremelimumab vs one [<1%]
patient receiving placebo) and colitis (16 [4%] vs none).

Adverse events leading to death occurred in 36 (9%) of
380 patients in the tremelimumab group and 12 (6%) of
189 patients in the placebo group (appendix p 16).
Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to the death
of more than one patient were mesothelioma (three [1%]
patients in the tremelimumab group _vs two [1%] in the_
placebo group), dyspnoea (three [1%] _vs two [1%]);_
respiratory failure (one [<1%] _vs three [2%]), myocardial_
infarction (three [1%] vs none), lung infection (three [1%]
_vs none), cardiac failure (one [<1%]_ _vs one [<1%]), and_
colitis (two [<1%] _vs none). Treatment-related adverse_
events leading to death occurred in five (1%) patients in
the tremelimumab group and none in the placebo group.
The causes of death were lung infection in one patient,
intestinal perforation and small intestinal obstruction in
one patient; colitis in two patients, and neuritis and skin
ulcer in one patient.

The most common treatment-emergent adverse events of
special interest (those occurring in >10% of patients) were
diarrhoea and dermatitis (table 4). The adverse events of
special interest (of any grade) that occurred in a larger
proportion of patients (≥10% difference) in the
tremelimumab group than in the placebo group were
diarrhoea (180 [47%] patients vs 36 [19%] patients), dermatitis
(169 [44%] vs 25 [13%]), and colitis or enterocolitis (39 [10%]
patients vs no patients). Notable secondary events for entero­
colitis or colitis included gastrointestinal perforation. Other
serious sequelae included severe dehydration and acute
renal insufficiency, metabolite abnormalities (either from
diarrhoea or dehydration-induced acute renal insufficiency),
blood loss from colitis, and anaemia requiring transfusion.
Three patients who had Clostridium difficile infections


reported as adverse events or positive tests, continued to
have diarrhoea or colitis after antibiotic treatment, and
required further treatment with steroids to resolve the
events. Grade 3 or worse endocrinopathy occurred in
eight (2%) patients in the tremelimumab group and no
patients in the placebo group. Elevations or reductions in
thyroid-stimulating hormone outside the normal reference
ranges (defined as ≥5 times ULN and ≤0·3 times lower
limit of normal) were reported in 12 (3%) and 21 (6%)
patients, respectively, in the tremelimumab group and in
zero and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group.

### Discussion
The results of the DETERMINE study show that in this
population of patients with previously treated relapsed
pleural or peritoneal malignant mesothelioma,
tremelimumab did not significantly improve overall
survival compared with placebo. The findings for
secondary efficacy outcomes, including progression-free
survival, objective responses, and disease control, also
showed no clinically meaningful differences between the
tremelimumab and placebo groups. A higher proportion
of patients in the tremelimumab group than in the
placebo group had a treatment-emergent adverse event
that was grade 3 or worse, serious, or led to dis­
continuation of study treatment. However, the safety
profile of tremelimumab was consistent with the known
safety profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors.

The study population in DETERMINE included
patients with unresectable pleural and peritoneal
malignant mesothelioma that had progressed after one
or two previous systemic treatments for advanced
disease. Although the treatment and prognoses of
patients with advanced peritoneal and pleural


-----

mesothelioma are not identical, they are considered to be
sufficiently similar to justify their inclusion in the same
trial[22] and this approach was acceptable to the regulatory
authorities during the trial set up. According to
investigator assessments, very few patients in the study
had stage I or II disease at study entry (<5%) and, despite
the fact that roughly 25% had stage I–III disease (when
patients can typically undergo resection), all patients
were deemed to have unresectable disease by
investigators at study entry


The overall survival analysis had a high maturity;
approximately 80% of patients had died at the time of data
cutoff. Furthermore, the median overall survival in the
placebo group (7·3 months) was consistent with the
median overall survival that the sample size calculation was
originally based on (ie, 7 months). This value was chosen
on the basis of results from the phase 3 VANTAGE 014
study, which showed no significant difference in overall
survival between vorinostat (7·1 months) and placebo
(6·2 months) as second-line or third-line treatment for


-----

pleural malignant mesothelioma.[23] Subsequent anticancer
treatment was given to a small number of patients in
DETERMINE and was mainly chemotherapy in both
groups; thus, no evidence suggests a potential confounding
effect of subsequent therapies on overall survival.

Progression-free survival data also had a high maturity;
roughly 90% of patients had progressed or died at the time
of data cutoff, and no clinically meaningful difference in
progression-free survival was detected between the
treatment groups. Evidence has shown that CTLA-4
blockade can lead to durable responses in melanoma.[24,25]
However, we noted no clinically meaningful differences
between treatment groups in disease control or durable
disease control. Consistent with the known activity profile
of CTLA-4 inhibitors,[12,13,26] a small proportion (<10%)
of patients achieved an objective response in the
tremelimumab group.

Treatment-emergent adverse events in the
tremelimumab group, including grade 3 or worse adverse
events, adverse events leading to death, and serious
adverse events, were consistent with the known safety
profile of CTLA-4 inhibitors,[12,13,26,27] were associated with
the underlying disease, or both. As with other antiCTLA-4 agents,[28] and in accordance with the two previous
phase 2 single-arm trials of tremelimumab,[12,13] steroid use
was central to the management of treatment-related sideeffects.

The adverse events in patients receiving tremelimumab
were similar to those reported for ipilimumab at a dose
of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks in stage III or IV unresectable
melanoma.[26] In that ipilimumab trial, the median
number of ipilimumab doses was four (ie, a median total
dose of 12 mg/kg),[26] whereas a median of three doses of
tremelimumab were administered in the current study
(ie, a median total dose of 30 mg/kg). In the ipilimumab
study,[26] the incidence of all-grade adverse events and
grade 3 or worse adverse events typically associated with
CTLA-4 inhibitors was similar to the incidence with
tremelimumab in DETERMINE, with the exception of
diarrhoea (47% of patients in the tremelimumab group
and 19% with placebo in this study _vs 33% and 5%,_
respectively, in the ipilimumab study). However, when a
more similar dosing regimen of ipilimumab (10 mg/kg
every 3 weeks) was reviewed against the tremelimumab
10 mg/kg dosing regimen used in this study, the
incidence of diarrhoea and grade 3 or worse diarrhoea
was similar between tremelimumab and ipilimumab.[29]

Gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhoea and enterocolitis)
were more common with tremelimumab than with
placebo and notable secondary events for enterocolitis or
colitis included gastrointestinal perforation, suggesting an
association between tremelimumab and colitis or
enterocolitis and perforation. In the tremelimumab group,
clinically significant grade 3 or worse endocrinopathy
occurred in a small number of patients (2%) and elevations
in thyroid-stimulating hormone were reported in 3% of
patients Hypothyroidism and its associated symptoms


develop over a prolonged period of time; thus, the small
number of cycles of tremelimumab that were administered
in the present study might have resulted in an
underestimation of hypothyroidism with tremelimumab
treatment. Consistent with the safety profile of CTLA-4
inhibitors, most endocrinopathy adverse events did not
resolve, but were managed with steroids, hormone
replacement therapy, or both. Hepatic toxicities occurred
in both treatment groups and were mainly asymptomatic
laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that tremelimumab
is not associated with hepatic toxicity.

Tremelimumab showed encouraging clinical activity in
two previous phase 2 studies in patients with pretreated
pleural and peritoneal malignant mesothelioma.[12,13]
Additionally, pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that
the more intensive dosing schedule used in the second
of these studies (MESOT-TREM-2012), and as used
in DETERMINE, would maintain tremelimumab con­
cen­trations throughout the dosing interval at or above
the target concentration of about 30 µg/mL.[13 ]Although
results from these two trials should be placed in context,
it is worth mentioning that both studies were small
single-centre, single-arm trials, which could partly
explain why these results did not translate into positive
results in the multicentre, randomised DETERMINE
study. Conversely, increased site experience with
checkpoint inhibitor treatment and patients’ com­
prehensive management in the course of therapy in the
single-centre trials might also have partly contributed to
the differences in outcomes between the two previous
phase 2 studies and DETERMINE.

The incidence of anti-tremelimumab antibodies in
patients receiving tremelimumab in this study was low;
thus, immunogenicity was unlikely to have been
responsible for the lack of observed efficacy The high


-----

concomitant steroid use by patients in the active
treatment group compared with the placebo group might
have affected the efficacy of tremelimumab in this study,
although no data from other immune checkpoint
blockade studies suggest a link between steroid use and
reduced antitumour activity.[30]

Immune checkpoint inhibitors are speculated to be
more effective in tumours with higher mutational loads
and therefore greater numbers of neoantigens, as
suggested by data from studies in lung cancer[31] and the
high mutational load detected in melanomas and Lynchsyndrome-associated tumours.[32] An analysis of the
malignant mesothelioma genome established that the
load of somatic mutations is low in this type of cancer.[33]
Thus, the absence of an overall survival benefit in
DETERMINE could be a result of the low mutational load
in malignant mesothelioma. A further explanation could
be that the highly immunosuppressive environment in
malignant mesothelioma[7] might preclude immune
activation in response to tremelimumab therapy. The
absence of a predictive biomarker for CTLA-4 blockade
means that identification of patients more likely to
respond to tremelimumab and other CTLA-4 inhibitors is
challenging and more research is required in this area.

The results of the Mesothelioma Avastin Cisplatin
Pemetrexed Study (MAPS) showed that bevacizumab
added to cisplatin and pemetrexed significantly improves
overall survival compared with cisplatin and pemetrexed
alone in newly diagnosed pleural mesothelioma.[4]
Although second-line pemetrexed has been shown to
improve progression-free survival and disease control
over best supportive care in previously treated malignant
mesothelioma where pemetrexed had not been used in
the first-line setting,[34] no randomised phase 3 study has
yet shown a significant improvement in overall survival
in second-line malignant mesothelioma in the postpemetrexed setting.[23,34]

To our knowledge, DETERMINE is the first random­
ised immune checkpoint inhibitor study in malignant
mesothelioma. Its double-blind design and large
sample size are important strengths; however, the study
also had some limitations. Patients had limited
exposure to study treatment (median of three doses),
which might have been a consequence of the advanced
disease in this trial population, given that the median
number of doses and treatment duration were the same
in both groups. Because of the low percentage of
patients in the study with peritoneal disease (<5%),
review of overall survival by anatomic site (a key
stratification factor) via subgroup analysis was not
possible. Additionally, interpretation of patient-reported
outcome data was limited by the absence of patientreported outcome data collection beyond the end of
treatment or discontinuation.

The rapid accrual to the DETERMINE trial underscores
the urgent and unmet need for new treatment options for
patients with malignant mesothelioma and for further


research to identify alternative therapeutic strategies.
Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monotherapies have shown
preliminary signs of clinical activity in malignant
mesothelioma;[35–37] thus, combining antibodies that target
the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway and the CTLA-4 pathway could
provide additional therapeutic benefit. Indeed, combined
CTLA-4 and PD-L1 blockade has been reported to enhance
antitumour activity compared with single-agent blockade
in preclinical models,[38] and has also shown a manageable
safety profile and preliminary signs of antitumour activity
in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.[39,40]
Multiple immune checkpoint blockade combination
regimens are currently under investigation in malignant
mesothelioma,[41] including tremelimumab with the antiPD-L1 agent durvalumab in the phase 2, open-label,
single-arm NIBIT-MESO-1 study (NCT02588131).
