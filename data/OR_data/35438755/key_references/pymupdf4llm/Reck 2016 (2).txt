Purpose
Patients with extensive-stage disease small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have poor survival outcomes
despite first-line chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum. This randomized, double-blind phase III
study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in
patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC.

Patients and Methods
Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide
and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total
of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab
or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance
every 12 weeks. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) among patients receiving at least one
dose of blinded study therapy.

Results
Of 1,132 patients randomly assigned, 954 received at least one dose of study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 478; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 476). Median OS was
11.0 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months for chemotherapy plus placebo
(hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P = .3775). Median progression-free survival was
4.6 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo
(hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). Rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events
were similar between arms, except for diarrhea, rash, and colitis, which were more frequent with
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Rate of treatment-related discontinuation was higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (18% v 2% with chemotherapy plus placebo). Five treatment-related
deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and two with chemotherapy plus placebo.

Conclusion
Addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy did not prolong OS versus chemotherapy alone in patients
with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. No new or unexpected adverse events were
observed with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Several ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in
combination with programmed death-1 inhibitors in SCLC.

INTRODUCTION


Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts
for 10% to 15% of lung cancer cases,[1] is an extremely aggressive tumor type; 70% of patients present with extensive-stage disease (EDSCLC).[2][,][3] The current first-line standard of care is
platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles
of etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin)


in the United States and Europe[4][-][7] and irinotecan
plus a platinum agent in Japan.[8] Despite high
initial response rates, nearly all patients with
ED-SCLC experience disease recurrence or rapid
progression after first-line chemotherapy. The
median progression-free survival [PFS] is approximately 2 to 3 months,[9] and long-term survival remains poor (2-year overall survival [OS]
is, 5%).[3][,][10] Multiple trials evaluating other


-----

agents or the addition of a third drug have failed to show a significant
improvement in median OS over etoposide and platinum.[3][,][10][,][11]

Thus, there is a significant need for effective therapy.
Several lines of evidence provide a rationale for the use of
immunotherapy in SCLC. The high frequency of somatic mutations in SCLC,[3][,][12] along with the presence of autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes,[13][,][14] suggests that SCLC is an immunogenic
tumor type. Preliminary studies have shown activity of immune
checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC.[15][-][17]

Ipilimumab, a fully human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal
antibody that abrogates binding of the checkpoint protein cytotoxic
T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) with its ligands, significantly
improved OS in patients with advanced melanoma in two phase III
trials.[18][-][20] Ipilimumab has also been evaluated in combination with
chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies of different tumor
types.[17][,][19][,][21][-][23] In a phase II trial, ipilimumab administered in
a phased regimen with carboplatin and paclitaxel significantly
improved immune-related PFS over carboplatin and paclitaxel alone
and showed a numeric though not statistically significant increase in
median OS over carboplatin and paclitaxel (12.9 v 9.9 months) in
patients with previously untreated ED-SCLC.[17] The phased ipilimumab regimen also significantly improved immune-related PFS
and PFS over carboplatin and paclitaxel alone in patients with
previously untreated non-SCLC (NSCLC).[23] The phase II results[17]

and preclinical data[22] led to the initiation of this multicenter,
randomized, double-blind phase III trial evaluating ipilimumab or
placebo in combination with etoposide and platinum therapy in
patients with newly diagnosed ED-SCLC (CA184-156 study [clinical
trial information: NCT01450761]).


PATIENTS AND METHODS


Patients
Patients with documented ED-SCLC were eligible. Inclusion criteria
included age 18 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and no prior systemic therapy for
ED-SCLC. Exclusion criteria included brain metastasis requiring treatment, uncontrolled pleural effusion, autoimmune disease, systemic immunosuppression, and any cancer immunotherapy.
The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board or
ethics committee at each participating center as appropriate and was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical
Practice. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment. An independent data and safety monitoring committee provided
oversight of safety and efficacy.

Study Design and Treatment Plan
The study consisted of induction followed by a maintenance phase
(Data Supplement). Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to
one to receive ipilimumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) or placebo using an
interactive voice response system with a stratified, permuted, blockrandomization method. Research staff was blinded to treatment assignment. Ipilimumab or placebo was administered in a phased dosing
regimen. During cycles one to four of induction (3-week cycles), patients
in both arms received etoposide 100 mg/m[2] IV on days 1, 2, and 3 of each
cycle and investigator’s choice of platinum agent on day 1 of each cycle
(cisplatin 75 mg/m[2] IV or carboplatin area under the concentration-time
curve 5 IV). During cycles three and four of induction, patients received ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo (3-week cycles) in addition to


chemotherapy; during cycles five and six of induction, patients received
only ipilimumab or placebo (Data Supplement). Patients who achieved
a complete or partial response per modified WHO criteria[24] during induction could undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI; investigator’s
choice) before the start of the maintenance phase. The maintenance
phase began 9 to 12 weeks after the last induction cycle (depending on the
timing of and recovery from PCI, if administered). Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg
or placebo was administered every 12 weeks until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death, for a maximum of 3 years from the first
ipilimumab or placebo dose. The rationale for this dose schedule of
ipilimumab was based on prior phase II/III melanoma and phase II lung
cancer trials.[17][,][19][,][23][,][25][-][27]

Random assignment was stratified by ECOG PS (0 v 1), lactate
dehydrogenase level (# upper limit of normal v . upper limit of normal),
choice of platinum agent during induction (cisplatin v carboplatin), and
region (North America or Western Europe v other). Criteria for treatment
delay and discontinuation because of treatment-related adverse events
(AEs) are detailed in the Data Supplement. No dose reductions were
permitted for ipilimumab or placebo. Results are provided for patients who
were treated with at least one dose of blinded study drug.

Treatment Assessments
Tumor assessment (including bone or brain imaging) performed at
screening was used as baseline for efficacy assessments. Tumor response
was investigator assessed per modified WHO criteria at weeks 7, 13, 19, and
25 and then every 12 weeks thereafter until progression or end of treatment. Safety was assessed by evaluating the incidence of AEs and laboratory
parameters and graded using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). AEs of interest were
defined as those with potential immunologic etiologies and grouped into
predefined categories: enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies,
and neuropathies. AEs of interest considered drug related by the investigator
were referred to as immune-related AEs.

End Points
The primary end point was OS among patients who received at least
one dose of study therapy. Patients were observed continuously for survival while receiving treatment and then every 3 months after treatment
discontinuation.
The trial was originally designed with a primary end point of OS in all
randomly assigned patients. During the study, it was determined that the effect
of ipilimumab on OS could not be accurately measured in this population of all
those randomly assigned. To avoid attenuation of the potential treatment effect,
the end points were modified by a protocol amendment.
Secondary end points included OS in all randomly assigned patients
and PFS per modified WHO criteria among patients who received at least
one dose of study therapy. Exploratory end points included best overall
response rate (ORR), duration of response, survival rate, and safety.

Statistical Analyses
Estimation of sample size was based on the results of a phase II study
in ED-SCLC and NSCLC.[17][,][23] Approximately 1,100 patients were to be
randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one; assuming a dropout rate of 15%
during the first two cycles of chemotherapy, it was estimated 935 patients
would receive study drug. The primary analysis was not conducted until
a total of 618 events had occurred in 935 randomly assigned patients who
received study therapy, which was estimated to ensure 90% power to detect
a statistically significant difference in OS, with a type I error rate of 5%
based on a two-sided log-rank test. For this power computation, an exponential distribution and a true hazard ratio (HR) of 0.77 in the
post-chemotherapy alone period was assumed. The expected smallest
statistically significant treatment effect corresponded to an HR of 0.85.
For OS and PFS, treatment arms were compared using an unstratified, two-sided log-rank test. HRs and corresponding 95% CIs were
estimated using an unstratified Cox model with treatment arm as the only


-----

covariate. Survival curves and rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. Best ORR per modified WHO criteria was calculated in evaluable
patients, and corresponding 95% exact CI was calculated using the ClopperPearson method. Statistical considerations in all randomly assigned patients
are presented in the Data Supplement.


RESULTS


##### Patients and Treatment
From January 2012 to September 2014, 1,414 patients were
enrolled at 224 study sites in 34 countries, with 1,132 patients
randomly assigned to receive etoposide and platinum plus ipilimumab (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab) or etoposide and platinum plus placebo (chemotherapy plus placebo; n = 566 in each


arm). A total of 1,123 patients received treatment (one or more
cycle of platinum and etoposide); the most common reason for not
receiving treatment was that the patient no longer met eligibility
criteria. Of those treated, 15% of patients (n = 169) discontinued
during cycles one to two, before administration of study drug, and
85% (n = 954) received at least one dose of blinded study therapy
(chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, [n = 478]; chemotherapy plus
placebo, [n = 476]; Fig 1; Data Supplement). This report focuses
on efficacy and safety analyses performed in randomly assigned
patients who received at least one dose of blinded study drug.
Analyses in the population of all those randomly assigned are
presented in the Data Supplement.

PS of 1 (70%). Demographic and baseline characteristics were
balanced between the two arms (Table 1).
The median number of doses of blinded study drug received
was four (ipilimumab, range one to 14; placebo, range one to 12);
59% received at least four doses of ipilimumab, and 69% received
at least four doses of placebo. The number of patients who received
carboplatin or cisplatin as backbone chemotherapy was similar
between treatment arms (Data Supplement). Across arms, 15% of
patients (n = 146) received at least one dose of maintenance
therapy (ipilimumab, 13% [n = 64]; placebo, 17% [n = 82]; Fig 1).
At database lock (June 10, 2015), 3% of patients (n = 24) continued


in the maintenance phase (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, [n = 14];
chemotherapy plus placebo, [n = 10]); the most common reason
for discontinuation was disease progression (Fig 1; Data Supplement). PCI was administered to 11% and 14% of patients in
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus
placebo arms, respectively. Subsequent chemotherapy was administered to 48% and 52% of patients in the chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively
(Data Supplement).

##### Efficacy
At database lock, 74% of patients (n = 707) who received
blinded study therapy had died. Median follow-up for OS was 10.5
and 10.2 months in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and
chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively.
Chemotherapy plus ipilimumab treatment did not result in
a statistically significant improvement in OS compared with
chemotherapy plus placebo among patients who received at least
one dose of blinded study therapy (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09;
unstratified log-rank P = .3775). Median OS was 11.0 months
(95% CI, 10.45 to 11.33) in patients treated with chemotherapy
plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months (95% CI, 10.02 to 11.50) in
those treated with chemotherapy plus placebo, with 1-year OS rates
of 40% in both arms (Fig 2A). At the time of analysis, 350 patients
(73%) in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm had died,
compared with 357 (75%) in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm.
Across most prespecified patient subgroups, HRs for OS did not
seem to favor one treatment arm (Fig 2B). Results for OS in the
population of all randomly assigned patients were consistent with
the primary analysis results (Data Supplement).
Median PFS was 4.6 months (95% CI, 4.50 to 4.99) in patients
treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months
(95% CI, 4.37 to 4.63) in those treated with chemotherapy plus
placebo; HR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97; unstratified log-rank
P = .0161) between arms (Fig 3). At the time of analysis, 443 (93%)
and 457 patients (96%) in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and
chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively, had experienced
disease progression. Furthermore, because the primary end point
of the study was not met, the P values of all secondary end points,
including PFS, are provided for descriptive purposes only and
should not be considered statistically significant.
Best ORRs were similar in the two arms. In the chemotherapy
plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively,
62% (in each arm) experienced partial responses, 26% and 27%
experienced stable disease, and 6% and 9% experienced progressive
disease. One patient treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
experienced a complete response; none were observed in patients
treated with chemotherapy plus placebo. Median duration of response was 4.01 (95% CI, 3.32 to 4.17) and 3.45 months (95% CI,
3.25 to 4.07) with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo, respectively (Table 2).

##### Safety
Rate of treatment-related AEs occurring on or after blinded
study drug dosing was 82% (48% for grade 3 to 4 events) with
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 76% (44% for grade 3 to 4
events) with chemotherapy plus placebo (Table 3). The most

frequently reported grade 3 to 4 treatment-related AEs occurring in 5%
of patients or more in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm were
neutropenia (14%), anemia (8%), diarrhea (7%), and decreased
neutrophil count (7%). In the chemotherapy plus placebo arm, they
were neutropenia (24%), anemia (11%), and decreased neutrophil
count (6%). Frequency of treatment-related serious AEs was numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (any grade,
27%; grade 3 to 5, 22%) versus chemotherapy plus placebo (any grade,
13%; grade 3 to 5, 11%; Data Supplement). A majority of treatmentrelated serious AEs occurred in less than 1% of patients; incidence was
similar between arms, with the exception of diarrhea (any grade, 8% v
1%) and colitis (any grade, 5% v, 1%), which occurred more
frequently with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (Data Supplement).
Treatment-related AEs led to discontinuation in 18% of patients treated with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 2% of those
treated with chemotherapy plus placebo (Data Supplement). The
most frequent treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation
were diarrhea (5%) and colitis (4%) with chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab. In the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, there were
five treatment-related deaths, two resulting from colitis, two from
sepsis, and one from liver toxicity. The two deaths resulting from
sepsis were assessed by investigators as being related to chemotherapy but not ipilimumab. In the chemotherapy plus placebo
arm, there were two treatment-related deaths, one resulting from
sepsis and one from bone marrow suppression (Data Supplement).
GI and skin-related AEs were the most common immunerelated AEs with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (in 34% and 29%
of patients, respectively). The most frequently reported immunerelated AEs in 5% or more of patients treated with chemotherapy
plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy plus placebo were diarrhea
(25% v 10%), rash (19% v 3%), pruritus (12% v 2%), colitis (6%


v, 1%), and alopecia (5% v 7%). Endocrine immune-related AEs
occurred in 10% of patients in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
arm versus 2% in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm; the most
frequently reported events in 1% or more of patients were hypothyroidism (3%), hyperthyroidism (2%), hypophysitis (1%),
and adrenal insufficiency (1%), as shown in the Data Supplement.
In the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, median times to
onset of grade 2 to 5 immune-related AEs ranged from 4.7 weeks in
the skin category to 9.0 weeks in the hepatic category (Data
Supplement). Immune-related AEs were managed using established safety guidelines. At database lock, a majority (76%; 184 of
243) of grade 2 to 4 immune-related AEs completely resolved, with
median times to resolution ranging from 2.0 weeks for hepatic
events to 28.9 weeks for neurologic events (Data Supplement).


DISCUSSION


To our knowledge, study CA184-156 is the largest phase III
randomized trial conducted to date in a population of patients with
ED-SCLC. The addition of ipilimumab to etoposide and platinum
did not result in a statistically significant improvement in OS versus
etoposide and platinum. Although exploratory in nature, chemotherapy plus ipilimumab did not demonstrate significant improvement in other end points, and no subgroups demonstrated
greater benefit versus chemotherapy alone. Baseline characteristics
were well balanced between arms; treatment delivery was comparable, and the frequency and reasons for patients discontinuing
during cycles one and two (before start of blinded study drug) and
in patients who went on to receive at least one dose of blinded
study drug were consistent with prior observations.[17][,][23] Post-study


-----

systemic therapy was received by a similar percentage of patients in
both arms of the study. The safety profile of chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab was consistent with that in prior chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab combination studies,[17][,][19][,][23] and no new safety signals
were identified. Immune-related toxicities were managed with
established safety guidelines, and a majority of grade 2 to 4
immune-related events resolved.
The performance of etoposide and platinum in this trial
was consistent with that in previous studies in this patient


population (ORR, approximately 60%; median OS, approximately 9.4 months).[3][,][11] The rationale for this phase III trial was
supported by preclinical studies showing synergistic effects of
ipilimumab with platinum and etoposide[21][,][22] and results from
the phase II trial of phased ipilimumab in combination with
carboplatin and paclitaxel in ED-SCLC.[17] It is unclear why
ipilimumab did not confer additional benefit over etoposide
and platinum. One possible explanation is that without corresponding T-cell activation in the tumor microenvironment,
ipilimumab monotherapy, which stimulates peripheral T-cell
activation, may not be effective in mounting a sufficiently
strong antitumor response in ED-SCLC. In addition, concomitant chemotherapy may increase immunosuppression,
which may be associated with limited T-cell activation and
proliferation.
Results from previous efforts to identify prognostic and
predictive biomarkers for anti-CTLA4 antibodies have been inconclusive. In melanoma, exploratory studies have suggested that
low baseline levels of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor
cells, low lactate dehydrogenase levels, low absolute monocyte
counts, high levels of circulating regulatory T cells, and high
relative lymphocyte counts may be associated with favorable
outcomes with ipilimumab.[28][-][30] However, validation is required in
larger patient populations, and not all markers were consistent
across tumor types.[31] An in vitro study in SCLC demonstrated that
the number and frequency of CD14[+] HLA–antigen D related/low
myeloid-derived suppressor cells could be associated with poor
prognosis.[32] A retrospective study of patients with SCLC reported
that the ratio of C-reactive protein to albumin could be an independent predictor of OS.[33] Both studies provide early evidence,
but further research is required.


-----

A recent report showed that programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
is expressed in tumor-infiltrating immune cells in the SCLC stroma,
although not in tumor cells,[34] indicating that patients with SCLC
with stromal PD-L1 expression may potentially respond to inhibitors
of the programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway.
PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and PD-L1 inhibitors durvalumab and atezolizumab have demonstrated antitumor activity and manageable safety invarious tumor types.[35][-][47] PD-1
inhibitors, which target tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, complement the antitumor activity of CTLA-4 inhibitors by acting through
nonredundant pathways.[20] The combination of nivolumab and
ipilimumab has demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity in
multiple tumor types, including melanoma and NSCLC.[16][,][38][,][48][-][50]

In patients with PD-L1–positive ED-SCLC who did not respond
to first-line therapy, pembrolizumab yielded a 29% ORR, with
durable responses (phase I KEYNOTE-028 study; clinical trial information: NCT02054806).[16] Nivolumab alone and in combination
with ipilimumab yielded durable objective responses (ORRs of 13%
and 31%, respectively), encouraging survival (median OS, 3.6 and
7.8 months, respectively), and manageable safety profiles in heavily
pretreated patients with advanced SCLC (phase I/II CheckMate 032
study; clinical trial information: NCT01928394).[15] Other immunotherapeutic agents, including tumor vaccines (eg, polysialic acid,
p53-expressing dendritic cells, and Bec2), have had limited success in
clinical trials in SCLC.[51]

In conclusion, the addition of ipilimumab to etoposide and
platinum did not improve OS compared with etoposide and
platinum in chemotherapy-naive patients with ED-SCLC. To
date, PD-1 inhibitors, alone or in combination with CTLA-4
inhibitors, show the most promise in SCLC.[15][,][16] Ongoing approaches include exploring these agents as maintenance after
first-line chemotherapy (CheckMate 451 [clinical trial information:


NCT02538666], STIMULI [Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Trial With
Nivolumab and IpiliMUmab in LImited Disease; clinical trial information: NCT02046733], and a phase II trial of pembrolizumab

[clinical trial information: NCT02359019]) or in second-line settings
in SCLC (CheckMate 331 [clinical trial information: NCT02481830],
KEYNOTE-158 [clinical trial information: NCT02628067], and
a phase II study of paclitaxel and pembrolizumab [clinical trial information: NCT02551432]).
