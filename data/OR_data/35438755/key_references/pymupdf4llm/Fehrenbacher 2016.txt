**Background Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer**
**(NSCLC). The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer,**
**including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infi ltrating immune cells, or both.**
**We assessed effi cacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1**
**expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infi ltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population.**

**Methods In this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum**
**chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in**
**Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1,**
**measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate**
**haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratifi ed by PD-L1 tumour-infi ltrating immune cell status,**
**histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block**
**size of four)** **using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel**
**75 mg/m² once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as**
**percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and**
**tumour-infi ltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and**
**IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at**
**173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least**
**one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.**

**Findings Patients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the**
**atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received**
**docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12·6 months (95% CI 9·7–16·4)** **for atezolizumab versus**
**9·7 months (8·6–12·0)** **for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·53–0·99]; p=0·04). Increasing improvement in**
**overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0·49 [0·22–1·07; p=0·068], TC2/3 or IC2/3**
**HR 0·54 [0·33–0·89; p=0·014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0·59 [0·40–0·85; p=0·005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1·04 [0·62–1·75;**
**p=0·871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defi ned by high T-eff ector–interferon-γ-associated**
**gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued**
**because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group**
**versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3–4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the**
**atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.**

**Interpretation Atezolizumab signifi cantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously**
**treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and**
**tumour-infi ltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefi t.**
**Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profi le distinct from chemotherapy.**

### Introduction
Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated,
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC); systemic chemotherapy (eg, docetaxel)
provides only modest benefi ts.[1] Programmed death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune-checkpoint protein
expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infi ltrating
immune cells that downregulates antitumoural T-cell


function through binding to programmed death 1 (PD-1)
and B7.1 (also known as CD80) receptors.[2,3] The
engineered, humanised IgG1 monoclonal anti-PD-L1
antibody atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; F Hoff mann-La
Roche/Genentech) blocks PD-L1–PD-1 and PD-L1–B7.1
interactions, resulting in restoration of antitumour T-cell
activity and enhanced T-cell priming.[4–6] Clinical

**Research in context**

**Evidence before this study**
Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated,
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC);
systemic chemotherapy provides only modest benefi t. Cancer
immunotherapy is an exciting new treatment option. We
searched PubMed from Dec 18, 2010, to Dec 18, 2015, for clinical
trials with the terms “non-small cell lung cancer”,
“programmed-death ligand 1”, “PD-L1”, “programmed-death 1”,
“PD-1”, and “cancer immunotherapy”, selecting relevant English
language publications within the past 5 years. We identifi ed
seven studies (phases 1–3, all of which were international and
open-label) of atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab.
Studies indicated the therapeutic value of targeting the
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–programmed death 1 (PD1) pathway to treat NSCLC, and that atezolizumab shows durable
responses as monotherapy for this disease. These responses were
associated with tumour cell and tumour-infi ltrating immune cell
PD-L1 expression, and the benefi t was more pronounced in
tumours with pre-existing immunity. However, these biomarker
hypotheses had not been tested in an atezolizumab randomised
clinical trial.

**Added value of this study**
POPLAR is the fi rst study of a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in a
randomised clinical trial of patients with previously treated
NSCLC. In our study, atezolizumab showed a signifi cant


improvement in overall survival compared with docetaxel in
patients with advanced, previously treated NSCLC. We saw
increasing improvement in overall survival with increasing PD-L1
expression in the atezolizumab group, whereas patients with the
lowest PD-L1 expression assigned to atezolizumab experienced
similar overall survival to those assigned to docetaxel. We also
showed that PD-L1 expression on both tumour cells and
tumour-infi ltrating immune cells is independently predictive of
survival improvement with atezolizumab.

**Implications of all the available evidence**
Targeting the PD-L1–PD-1 pathway improves outcomes for
patients with NSCLC. Together with reports of the anti-PD1
antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab, our results affi rm that
not only the receptor, but also the ligand components of the
PD-L1–PD-1 axis are valid targets for the treatment of lung cancer.
The predictive value of PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and
tumour-infi ltrating immune cells (rather than tumour cells alone)
suggests that an immunohistochemistry test for PD-L1 expression
on both cell types would identify a broader patient population
likely to benefi t from atezolizumab treatment than that identifi ed
by testing tumour cells alone. Additionally, the predictive value of
the T-eff ector and interferon-γ gene signature for improvement in
overall survival might provide insights into the biology of
atezolizumab effi cacy and aid development of the next generation
of diagnostic assays for therapies targeting this pathway.


pembrolizumab) have established the therapeutic value
of targeting the PD-L1–PD-1 pathway.[7–10] Blocking PD-L1–
B7.1 binding on T cells and antigen-presenting cells
might additionally inhibit downregulation of immune
responses, thus preventing inhibition of T-cell activation
and cytokine production.[11,12] Direct targeting of PD-L1
leaves the PD-L2–PD-1 interaction intact, potentially
avoiding eff ects on immune homoeostasis.[6,13–16]
Atezolizumab is engineered to eliminate binding to
Fc receptors and prevent Fc-eff ector function. This
modifi cation eliminates antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity and thus avoids potential loss of
PD-L1-expressing T-eff ector cells and reduced anticancer
immunity. Early-phase clinical trials of atezolizumab
monotherapy have shown durable antitumour responses
in NSCLC,[4,17,18] associated with tumour cell and tumourinfi ltrating immune cell PD-L1 expression when
assessed with immunohistochemistry.[17,18] These studies
suggest that the benefi t of atezolizumab is pronounced
in tumours with pre-existing immunity.[4] However, these
biomarker hypotheses have not been tested in a
randomised clinical trial.
Accordingly, we designed POPLAR to investigate the
effi cacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in
second-line and third-line NSCLC, and to further assess
the predictive value of PD-L1 expression levels on tumour
cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells


### Methods
#### Study design
POPLAR is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, allcomer phase 2 trial, done at 61 academic medical centres
and community oncology practices across 13 countries
in Europe and North America. The study was done in
full accordance with the guidelines for Good Clinical
Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocol (and
modifi cation) approval was obtained from an
independent ethics committee for each site (listed in
appendix).

#### Patients
We enrolled 287 patients. Eligible patients were aged
18 years or older, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1
(RECIST v1.1), adequate haematological and end-organ
function, and provided tumour specimens for central
PD-L1 testing on formalin-fi xed paraffi n-embedded
sections before enrolment. Key exclusion criteria were
active or untreated CNS metastases, history of
pneumonitis, autoimmune or chronic viral diseases, or
previous treatment with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, antiCTLA4, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-1 therapeutic antibodies,
or PD-L1–PD-1 pathway-targeting agents. Patients gave
written informed consent


-----

#### Randomisation and masking
Patients were stratifi ed by tumour-infi ltrating immune cell
PD-L1 expression, previous lines of chemotherapy (one vs
two), and histology (non-squamous _vs squamous), then_
permuted block-randomised (1:1) with a block size of four
to receive either atezolizumab or docetaxel using an
interactive voice or web response system (Bracket,
San Francisco, CA, USA). The sequence was generated by
Bracket; Bracket did not have any involvement in the rest of
the trial. The trial centres enrolled the patients. The study
was open-label, and allocation was unmasked.

#### Procedures
Patients received intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg
fi xed dose) or docetaxel (75 mg/m²) every 3 weeks on day 1
of each 3-week cycle. Atezolizumab was continued as long
as patients received clinical benefi t according to
investigator assessment (absence of unacceptable toxicity
or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease
progression after an integrated assessment of radiographic
data, biopsy results [if available], and clinical status), and
patients consented to continuation. Docetaxel was given
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. No
docetaxel-to-atezolizumab crossover was allowed.
We assessed tumours by imaging at baseline, every
6 weeks for 36 weeks after randomisation, and every
9 weeks (range 8–10 weeks) thereafter. Tumour
assessments continued until progression, irrespective of
treatment discontinuation. For patients in the atezolizumab
group who continued beyond progression, assessments
continued until discontinuation.
We assessed PD-L1 expression prospectively on tumour
cells and tumour-infi ltrating immune cells with the
VENTANA SP142 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). We scored
tumour cells expressing PD-L1 as a percentage of total
tumour cells and tumour-infi ltrating immune cells
expressing PD-L1 as a percentage of tumour area, as
previously described (tumour cells scored as percentage of
PD-L1-expressing tumour cells: TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and
<50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%; tumourinfl itrating immune cells scored as percentage of tumor
area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and
IC0<1%; fi gure 1).[4] Scoring was highly reproducible
among pathologists and clinical testing sites.[19] We
analysed immune gene expression in pretreatment
tumour specimens using a previously described Fluidigmbased gene-expression platform (Fluidigm; South San
Francisco, CA, USA).[4] The T-eff ector and interferon-γ
gene signature was defi ned by _CD8A,_ _GZMA,_ _GZMB,_
_IFNγ, EOMES, CXCL9, CXCL10, and TBX21. All of these_
genes had high co-expression in POPLAR tumour
specimens (appendix). These genes have previously been
associated with activated T cells, immune cytolytic activity,
and interferon-γ expression.[20–23 ] We also analysed by
_PD-L1, PD-1, PD-L2, and B7.1 gene expression. We defi ned_
the high biomarker group as gene expression at or above

the median level, and the low biomarker group as gene
expression below the median level. We collected serum
and tumour samples for pharmacokinetic, immunogenicity, and biomarker analyses.

#### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival (time from
randomisation to death) in the intention-to-treat
population and PD-L1 subgroups, using a hierarchical
procedure, and was centrally assessed. Secondary
endpoints included investigator-assessed objective
response rate (per RECIST v1.1), investigator-assessed
progression-free survival (time from randomisation to
the fi rst occurrence of RECIST v1.1-defi ned disease
progression, or death from any cause), and investigatorassessed duration of response (time from fi rst occurrence
of objective response to time of RECIST v1.1-defi ned
disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever
came fi rst).
Additionally, we assessed effi cacy according to immunemodifi ed RECIST criteria,[17] which were designed to
characterise unconventional response patterns associated
with cancer immunotherapy, as a secondary endpoint.
Other secondary endpoints were atezolizumab pharmacokinetics, patient-reported outcomes, bio markers, and
pharmacodynamics.
We graded adverse events with the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 4.0.[24] Laboratory safety assessments
included monitoring haematology and blood chemistry.

#### Statistical analysis
We did three interim overall survival analyses to monitor
the effi cacy and safety profi le of atezolizumab. We used a
small α of 0·0001 0·0001 and 0·001 for the first second


-----

and third planned interim analyses of overall survival,
respectively. We did the fi nal overall survival analysis
when 173 deaths had occurred in the intention-to-treat
population, using a two-sided α level of 4·88%. We
calculated that the analysis on the intention-to-treat
population had 82·3% power, with a two-sided α level of
5%, assuming about 180 deaths, with a HR of 0·65
(assuming event times are exponentially distributed,
median overall survival in the control group would
be 8 months, and patients would be enrolled
over 8 months). Assuming target HRs of 0·35 for
TC3 or IC3, 0·5 for TC2/3 or IC2/3, and 0·6 for
TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, PD-L1 expression subgroup
analyses of overall survival had 80% power.
We compared treatment groups for overall survival and
progression-free survival individually using a stratifi ed
log-rank test in the intention-to-treat population
(stratifi ed by histology, number of previous chemotherapy
regimens, and tumour-infi ltrating immune cell PD-L1
level). We used an unstratifi ed log-rank test in PD-L1
immuno histochemistry subgroups because of the small
sample sizes. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to
estimate median overall survival and progression-free
survival and to draw survival curves, and the BrookmeyerCrowley method for 95% CIs. We used stratifi ed Coxregression models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs in the


intention-to-treat population (using the same
stratifi cation variables as in the log-rank test). We used
unstratifi ed Cox regression models for PD-L1
immunohistochemistry subgroup populations. We
adjusted gene expression subgroup analyses for smoking
status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status, and sex, and stratifi ed according to PD-L1
expression as measured by immunohistochemisty
(IC0 and TC0 vs others), number of previous
chemotherapy regimens (one vs two), and histology (nonsquamous vs squamous).
For overall survival analyses, patients not reported as
having died at the time of analysis were censored at the
date they were last known to be alive. Patients without
information after baseline were censored at the
randomisation date plus 1 day. For progression-free
survival analyses, patients who were alive without disease
progression at the time of analysis were censored at the
time of the last tumour assessment. Patients with no
post-baseline tumour assessment were censored at the
randomisation date plus 1 day.
We calculated objective response rate estimates (and
95% CIs) for the PD-L1 subgroups and overall populations
using the Clopper-Pearson method. We estimated
duration of response using the Kaplan-Meier method for
patients with complete or partial responses (confi rmed).
Patients without assessment after baseline were
considered non-responders. Duration of response was
censored at the date of the fi rst occurrence of complete or
partial response plus 1 day if no tumour assessments
were done after the fi rst response.
We assessed primary outcomes in the intention-to-treat
population, and safety in all randomised patients who
received at least one dose of study drug. We did statistical
analyses with SAS version 9.2.
An internal monitoring committee evaluated interim
data during the course of the study. POPLAR is registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.

primary analysis data cutoff was May 8, 2015. Median
follow-up was 14·8 months (range 0·2+ to 19·6) in the
atezolizumab group and 15·7 months (range 0·1–18·7)
in the docetaxel group.
Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups,
except for an 11% greater proportion of female patients in
the docetaxel group (35% in the atezolizumab group _vs_
47% in the docetaxel group; table 1). Of 287 enrolled
patients, 97 (34%) had squamous, and 190 (66%) had nonsquamous, disease. 189 (66%) patients had one previous
line of chemotherapy, and 98 (34%) patients had two
previous lines of chemotherapy. PD-L1 prevalence and
patterns of expression on tumour cells and tumourinfi ltrating immune cells are summarised in fi gure 1. In
addition to patients with PD-L1 expression on both cell
types, we identifi ed distinct populations of patients with
PD-L1 expression on tumour cells only or on tumourinfi ltrating immune cells only across all PD-L1 expression
cutoff s (eg, among patients in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3
group, 86 [30%] expressed PD-L1 only on tumourinfi ltrating immune cells—ie, TC0 and IC1/2/3). TC3
and IC3 tumours showed minimal overlap (<1%; fi gure 1).
At a minimum follow-up of 13 months (60% of patients
had died), atezolizumab signifi cantly improved overall
survival compared with docetaxel (12·6 _vs 9·7 months;_
HR 0·73, 95% CI 0·53–0·99; p=0·04; fi gure 3A).
Progression-free survival was similar between groups
(2·7 months with atezolizumab _vs 3·0 months with_
docetaxel; HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·72–1·23; appendix).
21 (15%) patients in the atezolizumab group and 21 (15%)
patients in the docetaxel group achieved an objective
response (appendix).
Objective responses with atezolizumab were durable,
with a median duration of 14·3 months (95% CI
11·6–non-estimable) compared with 7·2 months
(5·6–12·5) for docetaxel (appendix). 12 (57%) of
21 responders in the atezolizumab group had an ongoing
response versus fi ve (24%) of 21 responders in the
docetaxel group at the cutoff date.
Overall survival benefi t from atezolizumab increased
with increasing PD-L1 expression on tumour cells, tumourinfi ltrating immune cells, or both (fi gure 3B–F). Overall
survival improvement was signifi cant in the TC2/3 or
IC2/3 (HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·33–0·89; p=0·014) and TC1/2/3
or IC1/2/3 subgroups (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·40–0·85;
p=0·005) compared with patients receiving docetaxel,
corresponding to PD-L1 expression in at least 5% of cells
and 1% of cells, respectively. Overall survival in patients
with TC0 and IC0 PD-L1 status in the atezolizumab group
was similar to that in docetaxel group. To assess the
independent contribution of each level of PD-L1
expression, we analysed non-overlapping subgroups. Each
tumour cell or tumour-infi ltrating immune cell level
independently contributed to the improvements in overall
survival in the TC2/3 or IC2/3 and TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3
combined groups (appendix). Additionally, patients in the
atezolizumab group with PD-L1 expression on tumour


cells only (TC1/2/3 and IC0 subgroup) and tumourinfi ltrating immune cells only (IC1/2/3 and TC0 subgroup)
had improved overall survival compared with patients
receiving docetaxel (appendix). Atezolizumab improved
overall survival in both responding and non-responding
patients compared with docetaxel (appendix). PD-L1
expression on tumour cells and tumour-infi ltrating
immune cells was not associated with docetaxel effi cacy.

Overall survival was also improved in atezolizumabtreated patients with high PD-L1 gene expression, as well
as in patients with high expression of other PD-L1–PD-1
pathway genes in tumour tissue (PD-L1 receptors _PD-1_
and B7.1, and the alternative ligand, _PD-L2; fi gure 4A)._
Further more, atezolizumab improved overall survival in
patients with tumours characterised by high expression
of T-eff ector-associated and interferon-γ-associated genes
(HR 0·43; 95% CI 0·24–0·77; fi gure 4B). The T-eff ectorassociated and interferon-γ-associated gene signature
was also associated with PD-L1 expression on tumourinfi ltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1
expression on tumour-infi ltrating immune cells indicates
pre-existing immunity within the tumour tissue
(appendix). We did not see an association of the T-eff ectorassociated and interferon-γ-associated gene signature
with PD-L1 expression on tumour cells.
As with overall survival, progression-free survival and
objective response rate tended to show increased
atezolizumab benefi t with increasing PD-L1 expression
(appendix). The greatest improvement was in the TC3 or
IC3 subgroup, with progression-free survival of
7·8 months with atezolizumab versus 3·9 months with
docetaxel (HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·31–1·16) and nine (38%) of
24 patients achieving an objective response with
atezolizumab versus three (13%) of 23 with docetaxel.
However, analysis of non-overlapping subgroups
suggested that, unlike overall survival, improved
progression-free survival and objective response rate with
atezolizumab were limited to only those patients with the
highest level of PD-L1 expression: the TC3 or IC3
subgroup (appendix). Objective response, as measured by
immune-modifi ed RECIST criteria, was achieved in
24 (17%; 95% CI 11·0–23·8) patients in the atezolizumab
intention-to-treat population, similar to the objective
response in 21 (15%; 9·3–21·4) patients, as measured by
RECIST v1.1 criteria.
In patients with squamous disease, overall survival was
10·1 months in 49 patients in the atezolizumab group
and 8·6 months in 48 patients in the docetaxel group
(HR 0·80; 0·49–1·30) in favour of atezolizumab. In the
non-squamous group, overall survival was 15·5 months
in 95 patients in the atezolizumab group and 10·9 months
in 95 patients in the docetaxel group (HR 0·69; 95% CI
0·47–1·01). Patients showed overall survival benefi t with
atezolizumab compared with docetaxel irrespective of
tobacco use history (HR 0·75 [0·54–1·04] for patients
with current or previous tobacco use vs 0·55 [0·24–1·25]
for patients with no tobacco use history).
Therapies received after discontinuing study treatment
are summarised in the appendix. No patients in the
atezolizumab group received subsequent PD-1 or PD-L1
inhibitors but seven patients in the docetaxel group
received subsequent PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.
Despite longer median treatment duration
(atezolizumab 3·7 months [range 0–19] _vs docetaxel_
2·1 months [range 0–17]) 57 (40%) patients in the


atezolizumab group experienced grade 3–4 adverse
events versus 71 (53%) in the docetaxel group (table 2).
This diff erence was more evident in grade 3–4 adverse
events assessed as related to treatment by the investigator
(16 [11%] vs 52 [39%]). The most common atezolizumabrelated grade 3 adverse events were pneumonia (three

[2%] patients) and increased aspartate aminotransferase
(three [2%] patients). No atezolizumab-related grade 4
adverse events were reported. The most common adverse

treatment with atezolizumab than with docetaxel (11 [8%]
_vs 30 [22%]). Grade 5 adverse events were cardiac failure_
(related to study treatment), pneumonia, ulcer
haemorrhage, pneumothorax, pul monary embolism,
and embolism in the atezolizumab group (one patient

treatment), death from unknown causes (two patients;
one related to study treatment), and acute respiratory
distress syndrome (one patient; related to study
treatment) in the docetaxel group (table 2).

### Discussion
Atezolizumab showed signifi cant improvement in overall
survival compared with docetaxel in patients with
advanced, previously treated NSCLC, unselected for PD-L1
expression. Improvement in overall survival increased
with increasing PD-L1 expression, whereas patients with
the lowest PD-L1 expression levels experienced overall
survival similar to that in the docetaxel group. Effi cacy
outcomes of patients in the docetaxel group compared
favourably with those in previous clinical trials in the
second-line setting.[25–29 ] Baseline characteristics were
balanced except for the higher proportion of female
patients in the docetaxel group; in some studies, female
sex has been associated with improved survival in patients
with advanced NSCLC, which could have resulted in
increased survival in the docetaxel group of our study.[30 ]

Patients with either squamous or non-squamous NSCLC
exhibited a numerical improvement in overall survival
with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel.
Atezolizumab was well tolerated with a safety profi le
consistent with previous studies,[4] and we identifi ed no
new safety signals. The safety profi le was distinct from
that of docetaxel, with lower rates of drug discontinuations
due to adverse events, grade 3–4 adverse events, and
adverse events common to chemotherapy, including
nausea, cytopenias, and peripheral neuropathy; most
atezolizumab-associated toxicities were low grade.
Potential immune-mediated adverse events, such as
increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine
aminotransferase, pneumonitis, colitis, and hepatitis
occurred at low frequencies (<5%) in the atezolizumab
group and were generally manageable and reversible.
POPLAR is the fi rst randomised study showing that
PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and tumourinfiltrating immune cells has non-redundant roles in


-----

regulation of antitumour immunity and predicting
response to therapy.
Very few patients (<1%) had co-expression of PD-L1 on
both tumour cells and tumour-infi ltrating immune cells
at the highest levels (ie, TC3 and IC3), suggesting that
TC3 and IC3 are distinct subpopulations in NSCLC. The
association of PD-L1 expression on tumour-infi ltrating
immune cells with the T-eff ector and interferon-γ gene
signature, a hallmark of pre-existing immunity, further
supports the hypothesis that PD-L1 expression is
regulated by diff erent mechanisms in NSCLC: an
intrinsic mechanism on tumour cells and an adaptive
mechanism on immune cells.[4] An adaptive mechanism
on immune cells is consistent with previous reports of
adaptive PD-L1 regulation in highly infl amed tumours.[31]

Importantly, PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and
tumour-infi ltrating immune cells independently predicted improved overall survival with atezolizumab. This
fi nding contrasts with anti-PD-1 studies that showed an
association with tumour cell PD-L1 expression only.[7–10]
PD-L1 expression on tumour-infi ltrating immune cells as
a predictive biomarker is further supported by the
association of T-eff ector and interferon γ gene signature
with improved overall survival. These data are also
consistent with the hypothesis that benefi t from
checkpoint inhibition is pronounced in tumours with
pre-existing immunity. Taken together, these fi ndings
confi rm the importance of assessing PD-L1 on tumourinfi ltrating immune cells, in addition to tumour cells, as
a predictive biomarker to identify patients most likely to
benefi t from atezolizumab. Neither PD-L1
immunohistochemistry nor T-eff ector and interferon-γ
gene expression was associated with prognostic
signifi cance on overall survival for docetaxel-treated
patients.
High expression of PD-L2 from within the tumour was
associated with improved overall survival for
atezolizumab treatment, despite atezolizumab leaving
the PD-L2–PD-1 interaction intact. Expression of PD-L2
has previously been associated with that of PD-L1,[32 ]and
does not seem to confer inhibition of the anticancer
immunity generated by atezolizumab therapy. These
data suggest that blocking the PD-L1–PD-1 and
PD-L1–B7.1 interactions and not the PD-L2–PD-1
interaction is suffi cient to provide strong effi cacy in
patients expressing the highest levels of PD-L2, but the
role of PD-L2 in anticancer immunity remains unclear.
Our results also highlight a unique relation between
measures of atezolizumab effi cacy (overall survival,
progression-free survival, and objective response rate).
Namely, overall survival, but not progression-free
survival or objective response rate, improved with
atezolizumab treatment in the intention-to-treat
population and in PD-L1 expression subgroups defi ned
by 1% or more and 5% or more tumour cell or tumourinfi ltrating immune cell staining. The strong
improvement in overall survival without an improvement


in progression-free survival or objective response rate in
these populations, together with the observation that
overall survival improved with atezolizumab in both
responding and non-responding patients, implies that
standard radiographic endpoints might underestimate
treatment benefi t with atezolizumab. These results
suggest that some patients benefi t after RECIST-defi ned
progression, possibly because of delayed anticancer
immune eff ects.
A key strength of POPLAR was that this study enrolled
patients irrespective of PD-L1 status, which was
prospectively assessed on both tumour cells and tumourinfi ltrating immune cells. The main limitation of
POPLAR was the moderate size of the trial, reducing the
ability to draw conclusions about atezolizumab benefi t in
smaller subgroups of patients. Therefore, further
assessment of atezolizumab effi cacy in this patient
population, including more precise assessment of
treatment eff ects in subgroups, will be provided by the
phase 3 OAK study (ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT02008227).
In conclusion, our data show that atezolizumab
provides survival benefi t in previously treated patients
with NSCLC, and that PD-L1 expression on tumour cells
and tumour-infi ltrating immune cells is predictive of
this benefi t. Additionally, the exploratory analyses of
T-eff ector and interferon γ gene signature deepens our
understanding of mechanisms of response to anti-PD-L1
blockade and provides a starting point for development
of future predictive biomarkers for cancer
immunotherapies. These data, along with those from
other atezolizumab studies in patients with previously
treated NSCLC, demonstrate the clinical effi cacy and
safety of targeting PD-L1 with atezolizumab in this
patient population.
