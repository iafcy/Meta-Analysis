**BACKGROUND**
Enhancing tumor-specific T-cell immunity by inhibiting programmed death ligand 1
(PD-L1)–programmed death 1 (PD-1) signaling has shown promise in the treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Combining checkpoint inhibition
with cytotoxic chemotherapy may have a synergistic effect and improve efficacy.

**METHODS**
We conducted this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate atezo­
lizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer who had not previously received treatment. Patients were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive carboplatin and etoposide with either atezoliz­
umab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo (according
to the previous random assignment) until they had unacceptable toxic effects,
disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,
version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary end points were
investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intentionto-treat population.

**RESULTS**
A total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202
patients to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median
overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in
the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54
to 0.91; P = 0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3
months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI,
0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02). The safety profile of atezolizumab plus carboplatin and
etoposide was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the individual agents, with no new findings observed.

**CONCLUSIONS**
The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival
and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by F. Hoffmann–

tandard-of-care first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung
cancer is platinum chemotherapy (carbo
# Splatin or cisplatin) with etoposide.[1-3] Despite re
sponse rates of 60 to 65%, limited progress has
been made in more than two decades; outcomes
remain poor, with a median overall survival of
approximately 10 months.[3,4] Small-cell lung cancer has a high mutation rate, which suggests that
these tumors may be immunogenic and could
respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors.[5-7]
Adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy may
enhance antitumor immunity and improve outcomes beyond those achieved with our current
therapeutic armamentarium. Clinical activity of
immunotherapies has been observed in patients
with refractory or metastatic small-cell lung
cancer [8-12]; however, a phase 2 single-group study
of maintenance pembrolizumab and a phase 3
study of ipilimumab plus chemotherapy showed
no improved efficacy in the first-line treatment
of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.[12,13]

Atezolizumab (Tecentriq, F. Hoffmann–La
Roche/Genentech) is a humanized monoclonal
anti–programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody that inhibits PD-L1–programmed death 1
(PD-1) and PD-L1–B7-1 signaling and restores
tumor-specific T-cell immunity.[14,15] In a phase 1
trial, atezolizumab monotherapy had an acceptable side-effect and safety profile, with promising
durability of response in patients with relapsed
or refractory small-cell lung cancer.[10]

The IMpower133 trial evaluated the efficacy
and safety of adding atezolizumab or placebo to
first-line treatment with carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer. We report a planned interim analysis of overall survival and a final analysis of
progression-free survival.


Methods


**Trial Oversight**
F. Hoffmann–La Roche/Genentech sponsored the
IMpower133 trial, provided the trial drugs, and
collaborated with the academic authors on the
design of the trial and on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of the data. The trial was
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical
Practice guidelines and the provisions of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided
written informed consent. An independent data


and safety monitoring committee reviewed safety
data regularly. Protocol approval was obtained
from an independent ethics committee at each
site. The protocol is available with the full text
of this article at NEJM.org. An author who is an
employee of F. Hoffmann–La Roche and an author who is an employee of Genentech analyzed
the data. All the authors vouch for the accuracy
and completeness of the data and for the fidelity
of the trial to the protocol. All drafts of the
manuscript were prepared by the authors, with
editorial and writing assistance funded by the
sponsor.

**Patients**
Eligible patients were adults with histologically or
cytologically confirmed extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer as defined according to the Veterans
Administration Lung Study Group staging system (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix,
available at NEJM.org),[16] measurable extensivestage small-cell lung cancer according to Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),
version 1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status score of
0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers
reflecting greater disability) who had not received
previous systemic treatment for extensive-stage
small-cell lung cancer. Patients with treated asymptomatic central nervous system metastases were
eligible (see the Supplementary Methods section
in the Supplementary Appendix). Key exclusion
criteria were a history of autoimmune disease
and previous treatment with CD137 agonists or
immune-checkpoint blockade therapies.

**Trial Design and Interventions**
The IMpower133 trial is a multinational, phase 1
(safety) and phase 3 (efficacy), double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive, in
the induction phase, four 21-day cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per minute, administered intravenously on
day 1 of each cycle) and etoposide (100 mg per
square meter of body-surface area, administered
intravenously on days 1 through 3 of each cycle)
with either atezolizumab (at a dose of 1200 mg,
administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle)
or placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The induction phase was followed by a maintenance phase during which patients received

-----

either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the
previous random assignment) until the occurrence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease
progression according to RECIST. Continuation
of the trial regimen after the occurrence of disease progression during either phase was allowed
if evidence of clinical benefit existed (see the
Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix). During the maintenance
phase, prophylactic cranial irradiation was permitted, but thoracic radiation therapy was not.
Randomization was performed with the use of a
permuted-block randomization method (IxRS)
and was stratified according to sex, ECOG performance-status score (0 or 1), and presence of
brain metastases (yes or no). PD-L1 testing was
not performed during screening owing to the
expected high rate of inadequate sample types
(e.g., fine-needle aspirates, bronchoscopy findings), the low prevalence of PD-L1 expression on
tumor cells, and the lack of an association between response and PD-L1 expression in the
phase 1 trial of atezolizumab in extensive-stage
small-cell lung cancer.[8-10,17,18]

Phase 1 of the trial was a safety run-in period
to establish the side-effect and adverse-event profile of the treatment regimens; during this phase,
a minimum of 12 patients were assigned to each
group and received at least two cycles of treatment. Trial treatments were administered at full
dose according to the protocol. Unblinded safety
data were reviewed by an independent data and
safety monitoring committee for assessment of
the side-effect profile; on the basis of the findings of the committee, the trial continued as a
randomized phase 3 trial.

**End Points and Assessments**
The primary end points were overall survival (the
time from randomization to death from any
cause) and investigator-assessed progression-free
survival (the time from randomization to disease
progression according to RECIST or death from
any cause, whichever occurred first) in the intention-to-treat population. Key secondary end points
included investigator-assessed objective response
rate (according to RECIST) and the duration of
response. Confirmation of responses was not
required per protocol, but confirmed response
rates were reported in the interest of rigor and
to protect against potential bias. The estimated
rate of overall survival at 1 year was evaluated.


Exploratory analyses included the assessment of
efficacy according to tumor mutational burden.
Assessments of tumor mutational burden were
performed with the use of a blood-based assay
(blood-based tumor mutational burden), as reported previously.[19]

Tumor assessments were conducted at screening, every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks starting
from day 1 of cycle 1, and every 9 weeks thereafter until the occurrence of disease progression
according to RECIST. Patients who continued
the trial regimen beyond disease progression
continued to undergo tumor assessments every
6 weeks until the regimen was discontinued. Adverse events were assessed according to National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The investigators
determined whether adverse events were related
to the trial regimen.

**Statistical Analysis**
The primary end points were assessed in the
intention-to-treat population and were analyzed
according to the assigned treatment, regardless
of the actual treatment received. For the analysis
of progression-free survival, data for patients who
were alive and had no disease progression were
censored at the time of the last tumor assessment. For the analysis of overall survival, data
for patients who were alive were censored at the
time of the last contact.
To control the overall two-sided type I error
rate of 0.05, a group-sequential weighted Holm
procedure[20,21] was used wherein the two-sided
significance levels of 0.005 and 0.045 were allocated to the primary comparisons for progressionfree survival and overall survival, respectively. The
test that was significant could pass its alpha
level to the test that was not statistically significant at the original allocated alpha level.
The sample size of the trial was determined
by the analysis of overall survival. We calculated
that 306 deaths in the intention-to-treat population would be needed to provide 91% power at a
two-sided significance level of 0.045 to detect
a hazard ratio for death with atezolizumab as
compared with placebo of 0.68, with the use of
a log-rank test. One interim analysis of overall
survival was performed when 238 deaths had occurred (the data cutoff date was April 24, 2018),
with a two-sided alpha level of 0.0193 (stopping
boundary), computed on the basis of the Lan–

than 10 events. As a result, the stratification factor of presence or absence of brain metastases
was removed from the stratified analysis because
it contained the level with the lowest number of
patients.
Kaplan–Meier methodology was used to estimate the probability of overall survival and progression-free survival, as well as to calculate the
median time from randomization to death (for
overall survival) and the median time from randomization to disease progression or death (for
progression-free survival) for each group, and the
Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used to
construct the 95% confidence interval for the
medians.[23] A similar approach was used for the
analysis of the duration of response. The hazard
ratios and 95% confidence intervals for overall
survival and progression-free survival were estimated with the use of a stratified Cox regression
model, with the same stratification factors that
were used in the stratified log-rank test.

The primary analysis of progression-free survival was conducted at the time of the interim
analysis of overall survival. No interim analysis
of progression-free survival was planned.
The stratified log-rank test (stratified according to sex and ECOG performance-status score

[0 or 1]) was used for the primary analysis. As
prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, the
stratification factor that contained the level with
the smallest size was dropped from the stratified analysis if at least one stratum had fewer


**Patients**
Between June 6, 2016, and May 31, 2017, a total
of 403 patients were enrolled at 106 sites in 21
countries and were randomly assigned to the
atezolizumab group (201 patients) or the placebo
group (202 patients) (Fig. 1). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the groups
(Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Twenty-two patients in each
group received prophylactic cranial irradiation.
In the intention-to-treat population, 104 patients in the atezolizumab group and 116 in the
placebo group received at least one subsequent
therapy (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Fifteen patients in the placebo group received subsequent immunotherapy.

**Overall Survival Analysis**
At the time of data cutoff, the median follow-up
was 13.9 months. A total of 104 patients (51.7%)
in the atezolizumab group and 134 patients
(66.3%) in the placebo group had died. Overall
survival was significantly longer in the atezolizu­
mab group (median, 12.3 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8 to 15.9) than in the
placebo group (median, 10.3 months; 95% CI,
9.3 to 11.3). The stratified hazard ratio for death
was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P = 0.007) (Fig. 2A),

samples (93.8%) yielded high-quality data for
analysis of tumor mutational burden. An exploratory analysis showed a consistent overall survival and progression-free survival benefit above
and below the prespecified cutoffs of 10 and 16
mutations per megabase (Fig. 2C, and Fig. S2 in
the Supplementary Appendix).

**Confirmed Objective Response Rate**
**and Durations of Response**
Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response
rates and median duration of response were
similar in the two groups (Table 2, and Table S5
in the Supplementary Appendix). In total, five
patients (2.5%) in the atezolizumab group and
two patients (1.0%) in the placebo group had a
complete response.


**Safety**
The population that could be evaluated for safety
included 198 patients who received at least 1 dose
of atezolizumab and 196 patients who received
placebo. The median duration of treatment with
atezolizumab was 4.7 months (range, 0 to 21),
and the median number of atezolizumab doses
received was 7 (range, 1 to 30). The median
number of doses of chemotherapy was the same
in the two groups (median, 4 doses of carboplatin and 12 doses of etoposide). The median dose
intensity and total cumulative dose of chemotherapy were similar in the two groups (Table S6
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse events related to any component of the
trial regimen occurred in 188 patients (94.9%)
in the atezolizumab group and in 181 patients
(92.3%) in the placebo group. The most common
grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to the trial
regimen were neutropenia, anemia, and decreased
neutrophil count (Table 3).
Deaths related to the trial regimen occurred
in 3 patients (1.5%) in the atezolizumab group
(death was due to neutropenia in 1 patient,
pneumonia in 1 patient, and an unspecified
cause in 1 patient) and in 3 patients (1.5%) in
the placebo group (death was due to pneumonia
in 1 patient, septic shock in 1 patient, and cardiopulmonary failure in 1 patient). Immunerelated adverse events occurred in 79 patients

Discussion


At the time of the primary analysis of progression-free survival and the interim analysis of overall survival, this randomized, placebo-controlled,
phase 3 trial showed that the addition of atezoliz­
umab to carboplatin and etoposide resulted in
significantly longer overall and progression-free
survival than chemotherapy alone. The median
overall survival was 2 months longer in the atezo­
lizumab group than in the placebo group, and
the 1-year overall survival rate was approximately 13 percentage points higher in the atezolizu­


mab group than in the placebo group (51.7% vs.
38.2%). Benefits with respect to overall survival
and progression-free survival were consistent
across patient subgroups. Objective response
rates and median duration of response were
similar in the two groups; however, more patients
in the atezolizumab group than in the placebo
group had an ongoing response at the time of
data cutoff (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In patients with treated brain metastases, no
difference between the two groups was observed
in overall survival or progression-free survival.
Owing to the small number of patients with
brain metastases enrolled in the trial and the
exploratory nature of the analysis, no conclusions
can be drawn. Further trials are needed to investigate the role of immunotherapy in patients with
small-cell lung cancer who have brain metastases.

An imbalance in overall survival benefit appeared to be present among patients younger
than 65 years of age, with older patients faring
better. There is no simple biologic explanation
for this observation, and further analyses are
needed to understand whether other factors may
have contributed to this result.
Exploratory subgroup analyses showed no
clear suggestion that blood-based tumor mutational burden levels at either cutoff (10 or 16
mutations per megabase) were predictive of benefit with atezolizumab in this population. These
results are in contrast to previous studies that
suggested an association between high tumor
mutational burden and better clinical outcomes
in patients receiving cancer immunotherapies.[24,25]
A possible explanation for the lack of greater
benefit with respect to clinical outcomes in patients with high blood-based tumor mutational
burden in this trial is that the combination of
platinum and etoposide is highly active and also
highly myelosuppressive.
In this trial, exposure to chemotherapy was
maintained with the addition of atezolizumab.
Rates of hematologic side effects were similar
in the two groups, and the incidence and types of
immune-related adverse events were similar to
those seen with atezolizumab monotherapy.[26-28]

One randomized, phase 3 study assessed an
immunotherapy (ipilimumab) plus chemotherapy
as compared with chemotherapy alone in the
first-line treatment of patients with extensivestage small-cell lung cancer, but no significant
difference in overall survival between the two
groups was noted.[13] Ipilimumab targets CTLA-4
and stimulates peripheral T-cell activation but
does not activate T cells in the tumor microenvironment; given this mechanism of action,
Reck and colleagues speculated that ipilimumab
may be of limited value when added to chemotherapy in patients with this disease.[13] One possible explanation for the effectiveness of atezo­


lizumab in addition to chemotherapy in the
IMpower133 trial may be that carboplatin and
etoposide might not deplete the intratumoral
T-cell population, and atezolizumab may be able
to activate the intratumoral T lymphocytes to
exert an antitumor effect; however, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
In addition, a single-group, phase 2 study
of maintenance pembrolizumab in extensivestage small-cell lung cancer did not show longer progression-free survival or overall survival
when compared with historical data.[12] In contrast, the current trial showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival with the addition of atezolizumab
to chemotherapy as first-line treatment. This
suggests that combining checkpoint inhibition
with cytotoxic therapy during induction may be
beneficial and potentially necessary to improve
overall survival beyond that seen with the current standard of care, and thus it may be a preferred treatment approach over maintenance
checkpoint-inhibitor therapy alone. Further studies
directly comparing the two treatment approaches
are needed.
In summary, this multinational trial in the
first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer in a patient population typical for
this disease showed that the addition of atezoliz­
umab to carboplatin and etoposide was associated with significantly longer overall survival and
progression-free survival, with a safety profile
consistent with the defined toxic effects of the
individual agents.
