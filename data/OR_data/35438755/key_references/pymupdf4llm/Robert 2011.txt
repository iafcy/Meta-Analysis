**Background**
Ipilimumab monotherapy (at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight), as compared with glycoprotein 100, improved overall survival in a phase 3 study involving
patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. We conducted a phase 3 study
of ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine in patients with previously
untreated metastatic melanoma.

**Methods**
We randomly assigned 502 patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma,
in a 1:1 ratio, to ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per
square meter of body-surface area) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter) plus
placebo, given at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks
through week 22. Patients with stable disease or an objective response and no doselimiting toxic effects received ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks thereafter as
maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.

**Results**
Overall survival was significantly longer in the group receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine than in the group receiving dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1
months, with higher survival rates in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group at 1 year
(47.3% vs. 36.3%), 2 years (28.5% vs. 17.9%), and 3 years (20.8% vs. 12.2%) (hazard
ratio for death, 0.72; P<0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.3% of
patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, as compared with 27.5% treated
with dacarbazine and placebo (P<0.001). No drug-related deaths or gastrointestinal
perforations occurred in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group.

**Conclusions**
Ipilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram) in combination with dacarbazine, as
compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, improved overall survival in patients with
previously untreated metastatic melanoma. The types of adverse events were consistent with those seen in prior studies of ipilimumab; however, the rates of elevated liver-function values were higher and the rates of gastrointestinal events were
lower than expected on the basis of prior studies. (Funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb;

he survival rate for patients with
metastatic melanoma is low, with an expected 2-year survival rate of 10 to 20%.[1-3]

# TAlthough dacarbazine has never been shown to

improve survival in randomized, controlled studies, it has been the drug most frequently compared with new agents or combination therapies
in randomized trials involving patients with melanoma.[4,5] High-dose interleukin-2 is associated
with durable, complete responses, with a survival
benefit, in a small subgroup of patients with
metastatic melanoma.[6,7] Ipilimumab, a fully human, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, blocks cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), a
negative regulator of T cells, and thereby augments
T-cell activation and proliferation.[8-12]

Two separate phase 2 studies support the rationale for the current study. The first phase 2 study,
involving 217 patients with previously treated
metastatic melanoma, showed a dose-dependent
response rate, with the highest rate of response
seen in the group receiving ipilimumab at a dose
of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight (11.1% in
the group receiving 10 mg per kilogram vs. 4.2%
and 0% in the groups receiving 3 mg per kilogram
and 0.3 mg per kilogram, respectively; P = 0.002).[13]
In the second, small, randomized, phase 2 study,
involving 72 patients, treatment with a combination of dacarbazine (250 mg per square meter of
body-surface area per day for 5 days every 3 weeks)
and ipilimumab (3 mg per kilogram every 4 weeks
for 4 doses) was associated with durable objective
responses, with no new adverse events; the rationale for such combinations has been reviewed
previously.[14-16] We conducted a phase 3 study to
determine whether ipilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg
per kilogram) plus dacarbazine, as compared with
dacarbazine and placebo, improves overall survival
in patients with previously untreated metastatic
melanoma.


Methods


**Patients**
Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age and
had previously untreated stage III (unresectable) or
stage IV melanoma with measurable lesions, an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 (with 0 indicating that
the patient is fully active and able to carry on all
predisease activities without restriction, and 1 indicating that the patient is restricted in physically
strenuous activity but is ambulatory and able to


carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, such
as light housework or office work),[17] and a life
expectancy of 16 weeks or more. The baseline serum lactate dehydrogenase level did not affect
eligibility. Patients were ineligible if they had received any prior treatment for metastatic disease.
Patients who received prior adjuvant therapy were
not excluded. Concomitant treatment with immunosuppressive agents or long-term use of systemic
glucocorticoids (except for the management of adverse events during the course of the study) was
not allowed. Patients were also ineligible if they
had evidence of brain metastasis (as confirmed on
imaging), primary ocular or mucosal melanoma,
or autoimmune disease.

**Study Oversight**
The protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review boards or independent ethics
committees. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles originating from
the Declaration of Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice as defined by the International Conference on Harmonization. All participating patients
gave written informed consent.
The trial was designed jointly by the senior
academic authors and the sponsor, Bristol-Myers
Squibb. Data were collected by the sponsor and
analyzed in collaboration with the senior academic
authors, who vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses. An initial draft
of the manuscript was prepared jointly by a writing committee that included five academic authors,
the sponsor, and a professional medical writer employed by the sponsor. All the authors contributed to subsequent drafts and made the decision
to submit the manuscript for publication. All the
authors signed a confidentiality disclosure agreement with the sponsor. The protocol, including the
statistical analysis plan, is available with the full
text of this article at NEJM.org.

**Study Design and Treatment**
In this multinational, randomized, double-blind,
phase 3 study, patients (stratified according to metastasis stage, study site, and ECOG performance
status) were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to
receive either ipilimumab (at a dose of 10 mg per
kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per square
meter) or dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter)
plus placebo at weeks 1, 4, 7, and 10, followed by
dacarbazine alone every 3 weeks through week 22
(induction phase). Treatment was discontinued if

toxic effects associated with the drug or progressive
disease was noted during weeks 12 to 24. At week
24, patients with stable disease or an objective response during the induction phase who did not
have a dose-limiting adverse event were eligible to
enter a maintenance phase in which they received
placebo or ipilimumab every 12 weeks until progression of the disease, development of toxic effects, or the end of the study.
In the initial design of the study, 500 patients
were to undergo randomization, and progressionfree survival was to be the primary end point.
Emerging data from other ipilimumab trials suggested that conventional definitions of disease
progression and response incompletely reflect
overall survival among patients who appear to
have a long-term benefit,[18,19] and in an amendment approved by the Food and Drug Administration on October 9, 2008, the primary end point
was changed from progression-free survival to
overall survival before the treatment assignments
were revealed. No change in the size of the study
was required, since it was already fully powered
to assess overall survival. No interim analysis was
conducted. Secondary end points included progression-free survival, the rate of best overall response
(defined as the proportion of all randomly assigned patients who had a complete or partial response), the rate of disease control (defined as a
complete response, a partial response, or stable
disease), the time to a response, the duration of
the response, and safety. Responses were defined
according to the modified World Health Organization criteria as the sum of the products of bidimensional measurements of target lesions; a
complete response is defined by the disappearance
of all known lesions, a partial response by a decrease of at least 50% from baseline in the sum
of the products of the diameters of index lesions,
stable disease by failure to meet the criteria for
either partial response or progressive disease, and
progressive disease by a 25% increase in an existing lesion or the development of a new lesion.
Tumor assessments were performed by the local
investigator and by a central independent review
committee.

**Assessments**
Radiologic and photographic tumor assessments
were performed in all patients at baseline and at
week 12, and in patients in whom the disease
had not progressed, at weeks 16, 20, and 24 and
every 6 weeks through week 48. For patients in


whom the disease had not progressed and who
remained in the study beyond week 48, tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks. Patients with progressive disease who entered the
follow-up phase were recommended to receive two
additional tumor assessments as part of the standard of care. All efficacy end points (except survival) were based on assessments performed by
the independent review committee, whose members were not aware of the treatment assignments.
Adverse events were graded with the use of the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0 (http://ctep
.info.nih.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_
applications/docs/ctcaev3.pdf). Adverse events were
reported from the date of the first dose up to and
including 70 days after the final dose. The study
included two additional safety analyses. One was
an analysis of immune-related adverse events (described previously[12]), which were defined as adverse events that were, according to the judgment
of the investigator, associated with inflammation.
The list of potential inflammation-associated
adverse events was defined prospectively, in the
protocol, before the database was locked. The
other additional safety analysis was an exploratory analysis performed to determine whether
specific adverse events were likely to be immunemediated and associated with ipilimumab treatment. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, identified through retrospective review of the data, were
adjudicated by a physician employed by the sponsor, in order to exclude noninflammatory causes
of the event, such as infection or tumor progression. The immune-mediated adverse reactions included specific events of clinical interest, such as
enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies,
or endocrinopathies, including hypophysitis.

**Statistical Analysis**
All analyses of efficacy were performed as prespecified in the protocol except for the 3-year survival rate, which was analyzed post hoc. The target
number of events for the primary analysis was 416
deaths, which we estimated would give the study
approximately 90% power to detect a 37% increase
in median overall survival to 11 months with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, with a corresponding
hazard ratio for death of 0.727, assuming a total
sample of 500 patients (250 randomly assigned
to each group) and a median survival of 8 months
for the patients receiving dacarbazine plus placebo. For the analysis of overall survival, a log

rank test was performed, at a two-sided alpha
level of 0.05, stratified according to metastasis
stage (M0, M1a, M1b, or M1c) and ECOG performance status (0 or 1), as classified at the time of
randomization. The final analysis of progressionfree survival was conducted on a database that was
locked after 416 events had been documented, as
originally planned. The hazard ratios for overall
survival and progression-free survival with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine as compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, and the associated twosided 95% confidence intervals, were estimated
with the use of a stratified Cox proportional-hazards model. Survival functions were estimated with
the use of the Kaplan–Meier method. A hierarchical testing procedure was implemented for a
comparison of the treatment groups in the order
of the following end points: overall survival, progression-free survival, rate of disease control,
and rate of best overall response. Additional details
of the methods are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.


Results


**Patients and Treatment**
Between August 8, 2006, and January 22, 2008, a
total of 250 patients were randomly assigned to
receive ipilimumab plus dacarbazine (ipilimumab–
dacarbazine group) and 252 were randomly assigned to receive dacarbazine plus placebo (dacarbazine group). The baseline characteristics
of the patients were balanced between the two
groups (Table 1). A total of 92 patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group (36.8%) and 165 patients in the dacarbazine group (65.5%) received
all four doses of ipilimumab or placebo. At least
one maintenance dose was administered in 43 patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group (17.2%)
and 53 in the dacarbazine group (21.0%). The
follow-up time between the start of the study (the
first visit of the first enrolled patient) and the end
of the study (the last visit of the last enrolled patient) was 54 months, and the follow-up time between the time the last patient underwent randomization (the first visit of the last patient) and the
end of the study was 36.6 months.
The most frequent reason for discontinuation
of the study drug across the entire study was
disease progression (in 46.2% of patients in the
ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 77.3% in the
dacarbazine group). Discontinuation due to a
drug-related adverse event was reported in 89 of


the 247 patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine
group who received at least one dose of the study
drug (36.0%) and 10 of the 251 patients in the
dacarbazine group who received at least one dose
of the study drug (4.0%): 85 of the 247 patients
(34.4%) and 10 of the 251 patients (4.0%) in the
two groups, respectively, discontinued the study
drug because of a drug-related adverse event after
receiving treatment in the induction phase; 4 of
the 43 patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine
group who received at least one maintenance dose
(9.3%) and none of the 53 patients in the dacarbazine group who received at least one maintenance dose discontinued the therapy after receiving treatment in the maintenance phase.
Therapy after disease progression was balanced
between the two groups; 54.7% of the patients in
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 59.0% in
the dacarbazine group received subsequent therapy. In the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group, 37.7% of
the patients received chemotherapy, and 2% immunotherapy; in the dacarbazine group, 34.7%
received chemotherapy, and 2% immunotherapy.
One patient in the dacarbazine group received the
BRAF inhibitor, vemurafenib, at the time of disease progression, but tumors were not routinely
assessed for the presence of the BRAF V600E
mutation.

**Efficacy**
Efficacy analyses were performed on the intention-to-treat population. A survival analysis was
performed after 414 deaths occurred, 37 months
after the last patient was enrolled. The median
overall survival in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine
group was 11.2 months (95% confidence interval

[CI], 9.4 to 13.6), as compared with 9.1 months
(95% CI, 7.8 to 10.5) in the dacarbazine group, with
estimated survival rates in the two groups, respectively, of 47.3% and 36.3% at 1 year, 28.5% and
17.9% at 2 years, and 20.8% and 12.2% at 3 years
(hazard ratio for death with ipilimumab–dacarba­
zine, 0.72; P<0.001) (Fig. 1A). Ipilimumab was
associated with improved overall survival across
patient subgroups, including those defined according to age, sex, ECOG performance status, baseline
serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and substage
of metastatic disease (Fig. 2).
There was a 24% reduction in the risk of progression in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group as
compared with the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio for progression, 0.76; P = 0.006). The median
values for progression-free survival were similar

in the two groups because the first assessment
of progression occurred at week 12 after the true
median. After the first tumor assessment, the
Kaplan–Meier curves separated (Fig. 1B).
The rate of disease control (i.e., a complete or
partial response or stable disease) did not differ
significantly between the two groups: 33.2% in the
ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 30.2% in the
dacarbazine group (P = 0.41). The rate of best overall response (i.e., a complete or partial response)
was 15.2% in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group
and 10.3% in the dacarbazine group (P = 0.09)
(Table 2). The median duration of response among
all randomly assigned patients with a complete
or partial response was 19.3 months (95% CI,
12.1 to 26.1) in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group
and 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.19 to 19.8) in the dacarbazine group (P = 0.03) (Fig. 1C). Some patients
in the study who were receiving ipilimumab had
an improvement from partial response to complete
response after 6 months (data not shown). Responses in the presence of new lesions were also
observed, although these were not captured as part
of the best overall response.

**Safety**
The safety analysis included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one
dose of the assigned study drug (498 patients).
The adverse events reported in the safety population are listed in Table 3. Adverse events (all
grades) for which there was a higher incidence in
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group than in the
dacarbazine group included elevation of alanine
aminotransferase levels (in 33.2% of patients vs.
5.6%), elevation of aspartate aminotransferase levels (29.1% vs. 5.6%), diarrhea (36.4% vs. 24.7%),
pruritus (29.6% vs. 8.8%), and rash (24.7% vs.
6.8%). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in
56.3% of patients receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine and in 27.5% of patients receiving placebo plus dacarbazine (P<0.001).
No gastrointestinal perforations were reported.
No cases of hypophysitis were noted in the ipilimu­
mab–dacarbazine group except for a single case
in a patient receiving maintenance therapy that
was reported on day 364 (which was outside the
protocol-specified reporting window of <70 days
after the last dose — a period representing 5 times
the half-life of ipilimumab — and was therefore
not categorized as an “on-study” event). No drugrelated deaths were reported in the ipilimumab–
dacarbazine group; one fatal gastrointestinal

hemorrhage was reported in the dacarbazine
group. Nausea and vomiting (see the table in the
Supplementary Appendix) as well as myelosuppression (data not shown), which are common
side effects of dacarbazine, were not increased in
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group as compared
with the dacarbazine group.
The most common study-drug–related adverse
events were those classified as immune-related
adverse events, which were seen in 77.7% of the
patients treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine
and 38.2% of the patients treated with dacarbazine
and placebo (Table 3). The most common immunerelated adverse events in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group were elevated liver-function values, with
grade 3 or 4 elevations in liver-function values
noted in 17.4 to 20.7% of the patients.
An alternative characterization of inflammatory
events was performed in which noninflammatory

fection) were ruled out (immune-mediated adverse
reactions). Severe (grade 3 or higher) immunemediated adverse reactions were seen in 38.1% of
the patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group
and 4.4% of the patients in the dacarbazine group.
The most common grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated
adverse reaction was immune-mediated hepatitis,
which was seen in 78 patients in the ipilimumab–
dacarbazine group (31.6%) and in 6 patients in the
dacarbazine group (2.4%). Grade 3 or 4 immune

mediated enterocolitis was seen in 12 patients in
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group (4.9%) and no
patients in the dacarbazine group. Hepatic immune-mediated adverse reactions were generally
reversible with treatment according to established
guidelines specified in the research protocol. The
proportion of patients who received glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressant agents after
the emergence of high-grade immune-mediated
hepatitis was 80.8% (63 of 78 patients, including
5 patients who received mycophenolate mofetil)
in the ipilimu­mab–dacarbazine group and 33.3%
(2 of 6 patients) in the dacarbazine group. Highgrade elevations in liver-function values were
normalized in 67.9% of patients in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group, with a median time to
normalization of 9.9 weeks (range, 1.0 to 56.1;

- The rate of disease control (defined as a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease) was 33.2% in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group and 30.2% in the dacarbazine group (P = 0.41).

as a result of complications of immune-mediated hepatitis or enterocolitis during the course of
the study.
Among the 43 patients who received ipilimumab and the 53 patients who received placebo
during the maintenance phase, the most common
adverse events (all grades, occurring in >5% of
patients in the ipilimumab group) were rash
(25.6% vs. 5.7%), pruritus (16.3% vs. 3.8%), diarrhea (14.0% vs. 5.7%), nausea (7.0% vs. 5.7%),
and fatigue (9.3% vs. 3.8%). Low-grade increases
in liver-function values were noted in 2 patients
receiving ipilimumab during the maintenance
phase. No high-grade elevations in liver-function
values were noted among the patients receiving
ipilimu­mab during the maintenance phase. Highgrade adverse events during the maintenance
phase were infrequent; among the grade 3 or 4
adverse events noted were colitis and diarrhea (in
1 patient) and rash or pruritus (in 3 patients). No
grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in patients
receiving placebo during the maintenance phase.


Discussion


In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab (at a dose of
10 mg per kilogram), in combination with dacar

bazine (at a dose of 850 mg per square meter), as
compared with dacarbazine plus placebo, was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival among patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma. More than 50% of
the patients had M1c disease (indicating the
presence of visceral metastases, elevated lactate
dehydrogenase levels, or both), and more than
35% had baseline elevations in lactate dehydrogenase levels — both of which are associated
with poor survival.[20,21] Durable objective responses were observed (median duration of best overall
response, 19.3 months in the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group, vs. 8.1 months in the dacarbazine
group). Prolonged survival was noted among some
patients who were followed for up to 4 years. In
the ipilimumab–dacarbazine group, an estimated
28.5% of the patients were alive at 2 years, and an
estimated 20.8% at 3 years, as compared with an
estimated 17.9% and 12.2%, respectively, in the
dacarbazine group.
The rates of some high-grade adverse events
in the current study differ from those in previous phase 2 studies of ipilimumab monotherapy
(at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram).[13,22-24] The

- The safety analysis included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of study drug (498 patients). Adverse
events and immune-related adverse events were prospectively defined: the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version
13.0, was used for the reporting of adverse events, and a list of events prespecified in the protocol was used to capture immune-related adverse events, which were a subgroup of the reported adverse events. The categories are not mutually exclusive (i.e., one patient could have
events in multiple categories).

events are in contrast to the results of phase 2
studies involving 325 patients (rate of diarrhea,
4% in this study vs. 11% in the previous studies;
rate of colitis, 2% vs. 5%). No cases of hypophysitis were observed during the course of this
study, whereas 2% of the patients in the previous
studies had high-grade endocrinopathy. The rate
of grade 3 or 4 rash was similar (1% in the current study and 2% in the previous studies). However, the rates of high-grade hepatic adverse events


in the current study were higher than those in the
previous studies (elevated alanine aminotransferase level, 21% vs. 8%; elevated aspartate aminotransferase level, 17% vs. 7%). The apparent shift
in the rates of adverse events associated with ipilimumab may be due to its combination with dacarbazine, which is known to cause hepatotoxic
effects when it is used as monotherapy.[25-27] The

ent reduction in gastrointestinal and endocrine
events is undefined.
In summary, this trial showed that there was a
significant improvement in overall survival among
patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma who received ipilimumab plus dacarbazine
as compared with dacarbazine plus placebo. Adverse events other than those typically seen with
dacarbazine or ipilimumab therapy were not identified. An increase in liver-function values is an
important side effect that was observed more frequently than expected with the combination therapy. Other ipilimumab-associated adverse events
(enterocolitis and endocrinopathy) were observed,

albeit at a rate that was lower than expected.
The key side effects of ipilimumab were managed
through adherence to treatment according to wellestablished guidelines, including the administration of systemic glucocorticoids or other immunosuppressant agents.
