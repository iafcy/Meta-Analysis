### Summary


**Background—Atezolizumab is a humanised antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)**
monoclonal antibody that inhibits PD-L1 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 and B7–1
interactions, reinvigorating anticancer immunity. We assessed its efficacy and safety versus
docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

**Methods—We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community**
oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of
0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more
platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients
with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with
docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were
excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200
mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m[2] every 3 weeks by permuted block randomisation (block size of eight)
via an interactive voice or web response system. Coprimary endpoints were overall survival in the
intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1-expression population TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 (≥1% PD-L1 on
tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells). The primary efficacy analysis was done in the
[first 850 of 1225 enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number .](http://clinicaltrials.gov/)

**Findings—Between March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the**
primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients
were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in
the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall survival was improved
with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel (median overall survival was 13·8 months [95% CI
11·8–15·7] vs 9·6 months [8·6–11·2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·62–0·87], p=0·0003).
Overall survival in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population was improved with atezolizumab (n=241)
compared with docetaxel (n=222; median overall survival was 15·7 months [95% CI 12·6–18·0]
with atezolizumab vs 10·3 months [8·8–12·0] with docetaxel; HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·58–0·93];
p=0·0102). Patients in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) also had improved
survival with atezolizumab (median overall survival 12·6 months vs 8·9 months; HR 0·75 [95% CI
0·59–0·96]). Overall survival improvement was similar in patients with squamous (HR 0·73 [95%
CI 0·54–0·98]; n=112 in the atezolizumab group and n=110 in the docetaxel group) or nonsquamous (0·73 [0·60–0·89]; n=313 and n=315) histology. Fewer patients had treatment-related
grade 3 or 4 adverse events with atezolizumab (90 [15%] of 609 patients) versus docetaxel (247

[43%] of 578 patients). One treatment-related death from a respiratory tract infection was reported
in the docetaxel group.

**Interpretation—To our knowledge, OAK is the first randomised phase 3 study to report results**
of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, with atezolizumab treatment resulting in a clinically relevant
improvement of overall survival versus docetaxel in previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer,
regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety profile.


### Introduction

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death globally, and outcomes for patients
diagnosed with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer are poor despite recent advances in
treatment.[1] Docetaxel has been the standard of care for second-line or third-line treatment;
however, its efficacy is offset by substantial toxic effects. The new development of
antibodies that target the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed death-1
(PD-1) pathway represents an important advance in the management of metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer, with PD-1 inhibitors showing overall survival benefits over
docetaxel. Compared with docetaxel, nivolumab has shown a median overall survival of 9·2
months versus 6·0 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0·59, 95% CI 0·44–0·79) in squamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer and 12·2 months versus 9·4 months (96% CI 0·73, 0·59–0·89) in nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer.[2,3] Additionally, pembrolizumab compared with
docetaxel has shown a median overall survival of 10·4 months versus 8·5 months (HR 0·71,
95% CI 0·58–0·88) at the approved dose of 2 mg/kg in a patient population with non-smallcell lung cancer who expressed PD-L1 in 1% or more of tumour cells.[4]


PD-L1 is an immune checkpoint protein expressed on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating
immune cells. PD-L1 can mediate suppression of anticancer immunity by binding to its
receptors PD-1 and B7–1 (also known as CD80).[5–7] Atezolizumab is a humanised
engineered IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting PD-L1 and thus has a mechanism of action
distinct from anti-PD-1 antibodies. In addition to blocking the PD-L1 and PD-1 interaction,
which can reinvigorate suppressed immune cells to eliminate cancer cells,[8–10] atezolizumab
blocks PD-L1 and B7–1 binding, which might further enhance immune responses.[11–14 ]

Furthermore, direct targeting of PD-L1 leaves the PD-L2 and PD-1 interaction intact and
might minimise autoimmunity.[8,15,16]


A phase 1 study[17] of atezolizumab monotherapy has shown durable antitumour responses in
non-small-cell lung cancer and has shown an association of PD-L1 expression on tumour
cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells with patients who had an objective response.[9] In
the phase 2, randomised POPLAR study,[18,19] atezolizumab improved overall survival
compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (12·6
months vs 9·7 months; HR 0·69, 95% CI 0·52–0·92) in the intention-to-treat (ITT)
population. Additionally, results from POPLAR suggested that there are two distinct
subpopulations of non-small-cell lung cancer that can be identified through PD-L1
expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, with PD-L1 expression on
tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells independently contributing to overall
survival.[18]

We report the primary analysis of the OAK study, the first, to our knowledge, phase 3 study
of a PD-L1-directed antibody (atezolizumab). OAK was designed to investigate the efficacy

and safety of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or
metastatic, previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer.


### Methods

**Study design**


**Patients**


OAK is a randomised, open-label, international phase 3 study that was done in 194 academic
medical centres and community oncology practices across 31 countries worldwide. The
study was done in full accordance with the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the
Declaration of Helsinki.

Patients had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older,
had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; version
1.1), and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients
had received 1–2 previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (≥1 platinum based
combination therapy) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with EGFR
mutations or an ALK fusion oncogene were additionally required to have received previous
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Patients with treated asymptomatic supratentorial CNS
metastases were eligible, whereas patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those
who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or
therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded (appendix). All patients
gave written informed consent.


**Randomisation and masking**

Patients were stratified by PD-L1 expression (IC0 vs IC1 vs IC2 vs IC3 level), number of
previous chemotherapy regimens (one vs two), and histology (non-squamous vs squamous).
PD-L1 expression was assessed centrally and prospectively in archival or fresh tumour
samples according to previously published scoring criteria[18] with the VENTANA SP142
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ, USA).
TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 was defined as PD-L1 expression on 1% or more of tumour cells or
tumour-infiltrating immune cells, TC2/3 or IC2/3 was defined as PD-L1 expression on 5%
of these cells; TC3 was defined as PD-L1 expression on 50% or more of tumour cells and
IC3 was defined as 10% or more of tumour-infiltrating immune cells; and TC0 as PD-L1
expression on less than 1% of tumour cells and IC0 on less than 1% of tumour-infiltrating
immune cells (appendix). PD-L1 gene expression was assessed in tumour tissue with a
Fluidigm-based gene-expression platform as previously described (Fluidigm; South San
Francisco, CA, USA).[18] Permuted block-randomisation (block size of eight) via an
interactive voice or web response system (bracket) was used to assign patients in a 1:1 ratio
to receive atezolizumab or docetaxel. The trial centres enrolled the patients. The study was
open-label and allocation was unmasked.


**Procedures**


Atezolizumab was given as an intravenous 1200 mg fixed dose every 3 weeks; docetaxel was
given intravenously at 75 mg/m[2] every 3 weeks. Treatment was administered until

unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, as assessed by the investigator. Atezolizumab
treatment could continue beyond disease progression if the investigator deemed the patient
to be receiving clinical benefit. No crossover to atezolizumab was allowed.

Tumour assessments were done at baseline, then every 6 weeks until week 36 and every 9
weeks thereafter. These assessments continued until disease progression, regardless of
treatment discontinuation. For patients receiving atezolizumab beyond disease progression,
tumour assessments continued until treatment discontinuation. Patients were followed up for
survival throughout the study while receiving treatment and every 3 months after treatment
discontinuation.


**Outcomes**


The primary endpoint was overall survival compared between treatment groups within the
ITT and the PD-L1 TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 populations (PD-L1 expression on ≥1% of tumour
cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells[18]). Secondary endpoints included investigatorassessed progression-free survival, proportion of patients who had an objective response,
duration of response, and safety.

Safety was assessed descriptively and based on all patients who received any dose of study
treatment. The incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities
were assessed by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 4.0.[20]


**Statistical analysis**

OAK was initially designed to enrol 850 patients, and the sample size was later increased to
enrol up to 1300 patients to power for an overall survival comparison in patients with high
PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3, assuming a prevalence of approximately 20%); the final
enrolment was 1225 patients. Data from the phase 2 randomised study POPLAR[18] showed
that the overall survival benefit extended to lower PD-L1 expression levels and that the
assessment of this benefit required a relatively long follow-up because of the late separation
of survival curves. Therefore, the OAK statistical design was amended on Jan 28, 2016,
according to a prespecified modification plan to test overall survival in the ITT population
and in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population in a coprimary fashion (with α splitting between
the ITT population [α=3%] and the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population [α=2%]) for which the
initial 850 randomised patients provided sufficient power (95·3% in the ITT population and
98·6% in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population) and follow-up time. Therefore, the primary
efficacy analysis population comprises the first 850 patients who were randomly assigned to
a treatment group.


The primary analysis of overall survival was planned when approximately 70% of patients in
the primary efficacy analysis population had died. Overall survival was compared between
treatment groups with a stratified log-rank test at the two-sided significance level. The
Kaplan-Meier approach was used to estimate the median overall survival; the BrookmeyerCrowley methodology was used to estimate 95% CIs. The HR was estimated with a
stratified Cox regression analysis. Stratification factors were the same used for
randomisation. Prespecified analyses were done to determine the consistency of the

treatment effect according to key baseline characteristics and in different subgroups of
patients according to their tumour PD-L1 expression level. Given the exploratory nature of
subgroup analyses and potential small sample sizes in specific subgroups, the HRs from
these analyses were estimated with an unstratified Cox regression analysis. Patients not
reported as having died at the time of analysis were censored at the date they were last
known to be alive. Patients without post-baseline information were censored at the
randomisation date plus 1 day.

Progression-free survival and duration of response were analysed with the same methods as
the overall survival analysis. The proportion of patients with an objective response and the
corresponding 95% CIs for each treatment group were calculated with the Clopper-Pearson
method and compared between treatment groups with the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test.


An independent data monitoring committee reviewed safety. Protocol approval was obtained
from independent ethics committees for each site (listed in the appendix). Statistical
analyses were done with the SAS version 9.2. This study is registered with
[ClinicalTrials.gov, number .](http://clinicaltrials.gov/)


**Role of the funding source**

The funder of the study provided study drugs, was involved in the study design, data
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, and gave approval to
submit for publication. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study
and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.


### Results


Between March 11, 2014, and Nov 28, 2014, 850 patients in the primary analysis population
were recruited at 194 academic or community oncology centres across 31 countries; 425
patients were randomised to receive atezolizumab and 425 to receive docetaxel (ITT
population; figure 1). Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between
groups (table 1; appendix). Enrolment of the final 375 patients took place until April 29,
2015. Of the final 1225 patients randomly assigned in the total patient population, 609
patients received atezolizumab and 578 patients received docetaxel (safety population). 125
(21%) of 609 patients in the atezolizumab group and 14 (2%) of 578 patients in the
docetaxel group had a treatment duration longer than 12 months. Median treatment duration
was 3·4 months (range 0–26) with atezolizumab and 2·1 months (range 0–23) with
docetaxel. 40% of patients receiving atezolizumab were treated beyond progression, with a
median treatment duration beyond progression of three cycles (range 1–34).

At the primary analysis (data cutoff July 7, 2016), the median follow-up was 21 months and
569 patients had died (271 in the atezolizumab group and 298 in the docetaxel group; event
to patient ratio 67%). Compared with docetaxel, overall survival was better with
atezolizumab in both the ITT and TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 populations (figures 2A, 2B). Overall
survival was improved in the ITT population with atezolizumab (median 13·8 months [95%
CI 11·8–15·7]) versus docetaxel (median 9·6 months [8·6–11·2]; HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·62–
0·87], p=0·0003; figure 2A). At the cutoff date in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population, 300

-----

patients had died (149 [67%] of 222 patients in the docetaxel group and 151 [63%] of 241
patients in the atezolizumab group). Overall survival was significantly longer with
atezolizumab than with docetaxel (median 15·7 months [95% CI 12·6–18·0] with
atezolizumab vs 10·3 months [8·8–12·0] with docetaxel; HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·58–0·93],
p=0·0102; figure 2B).

After discontinuation of study treatment, 73 (17%) of 425 patients in the docetaxel group
were known to have received immunotherapy (primarily nivolumab) compared with 19 (4%)
of 425 patients in the atezolizumab group (appendix). The proportion of patients who
received subsequent chemotherapy, predominantly docetaxel, was higher in the
atezolizumab group (176 [41%] of 425 patients) than in the docetaxel group (131 [31%] of
425 patients). Subsequent targeted therapy was balanced between groups.


Progression-free survival was similar between treatment groups in the ITT population (HR
0·95 [95% CI 0·82–1·10]). Median progression-free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·6–
3·0) with atezolizumab and 4·0 months (3·3–4·2) with docetaxel (table 2, appendix). The
proportion of patients with an objective response in the ITT population was also similar
between treatment groups (table 2). However, median duration of response in the ITT
population was notably longer in the atezolizumab group at 16·3 months (95% CI 10·0–not
evaluable) compared with 6·2 months (4·9–7·6) in the docetaxel group (table 2). At the time
of data cutoff, responses were ongoing in 30 (52%) of 58 patients in the atezolizumab group
and in ten (18%) of 57 patients in the docetaxel group.

Overall survival was improved regardless of PD-L1 expression levels (figure 2C–F): patients
in the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup (TC0 and IC0) derived benefit from
atezolizumab treatment over docetaxel (median overall survival 12·6 months [95% CI 9·6–
15·2] vs 8·9 months [7·7–11·5]; HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·59–0·96]; figure 2E). These results are
consistent with our analysis of PD-L1 gene expression in tumour tissue, which showed an
overall survival benefit in patients with lower than median expression of PD-L1 (50%
prevalence; HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·58–0·96]; appendix). Patients with high PD-L1 expression
(TC3 or IC3 subgroup) derived the greatest benefit from atezolizumab (median overall
survival 20·5 months [95% CI 17·5–not evaluable] vs 8·9 months [5·6–11·6]; HR 0·41 [95%
CI 0·27–0·64]; figure 2D). Although overall survival improvement was noted in all PD-L1
expression subgroups, including the PD-L1 low or undetectable subgroup, the interaction
test analysis of mutually exclusive PD-L1 groups and treatment indicated that PD-L1
expression might be a modifier of treatment effect on overall survival (appendix); however,
this finding might be attributed to the pronounced overall survival benefit at the highest
expression level (TC3 or IC3; figure 2). To assess the independent contribution of PD-L1
expression on tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells we analysed non-overlapping
subgroups. In the TC1/2/3 and IC0 subgroup, median overall survival was 13·2 months (95%
CI 7·8–20·5) with atezolizumab and 12·0 months (3·7–14·7) with docetaxel (HR 0·72 [95%
CI 0·36–1·45]). In the TC0 and IC1/2/3 subgroup, median overall survival was 14·3 months
(95% CI 10·6–18·4) with atezolizumab and 9·8 months (7·3–13·7) with docetaxel (HR 0·73,
95% CI 0·52–1·02). Point estimates for the overall survival HR in both subgroups were
similar to that noted for the ITT population, sample sizes were smaller and 95% CIs crossed
1; thus benefit was inconclusive. Overall survival HRs favoured atezolizumab across

predefined subgroups, including in patients with squamous (HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·54–0·98]) or
non-squamous disease (0·73 [0·60–0·89]; figure 3), patients with treated CNS metastases at
baseline (0·54 [0·31–0·94]) and never smokers (0·71 [0·47–1·08]; figure 3). The exception
was patients with EGFR mutation-positive status (HR 1·24 [95% CI 0·71–2·18]; figure 3).

Progression-free survival was similar in both treatment arms in PD-L1 subgroups (including
the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 population; table 2, appendix), with the exception of the TC3 or IC3
group, which showed a greater benefit with atezolizumab than with docetaxel (progressionfree survival HR 0·63 [95% CI 0·43–0·91], appendix). The proportion of patients with an
objective response improved with atezolizumab versus docetaxel treatment in the TC3 or
IC3 subgroup (22 [31%] of 72 patients vs seven [11%] of 65 patients), and was lowest in the
TC0 and IC0 population (14 [8%] of 180 patients vs 21 [11%] of 199 patients). Duration of
response improvement with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel was similar in all PD-L1
expression subgroups (table 2, appendix). PD-L1 expression status did not appear to be
predictive for responses in patients treated with docetaxel.


Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 227 (37%) of 609 patients treated with
atezolizumab and 310 (54%) of 578 patients treated with docetaxel. There were fewer
treatment-related adverse events with atezolizumab than with docetaxel, including grade 3 or
4 events (90 [15%] of 609 patients vs 247 [43%] of 578 patients, figure 4A; table 3). In the
609 patients, fatigue (87 [14%] patients), nausea (53 [9%] patients), decreased appetite (52

[9%] patients), and asthenia (51 [8%] patients) were the most common atezolizumab-related
adverse events of any grade.

Figure 4B shows all adverse events with a difference in incidence between groups of 5% or
more. Of those, pruritus was more common with atezolizumab than with docetaxel.
Musculoskeletal pain was more common with atezolizumab but rates of myalgia were higher
with docetaxel. Adverse events occurring in 10% or more of patients in any group are shown
in the appendix.


In the 609 patients in the safety analysis, immune-mediated adverse events reported with
atezolizumab included pneumonitis (six [1%] patients at any grade; four [<1%] patients at
grade 3, hepatitis (two [<1%] patients, both grade 4), and colitis (two [<1%] patients, both
grade 2).

Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation occurred in 46 (8%) of 609 patients
with atezolizumab and in 108 (19%) of 578 patients with docetaxel. There were no deaths
related to atezolizumab and one related to docetaxel (respiratory tract infection).


### Discussion

To our knowledge, OAK, the first randomised phase 3 trial of a PD-L1-targeted therapy, met
its coprimary endpoint, showing that atezolizumab treatment resulted in a significant
improvement in overall survival compared with docetaxel in patients with advanced stage
non-small-cell lung cancer (in the ITT and TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 populations) whose disease
had progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy. These clinically meaningful
data confirm the results of a phase 2 study (POPLAR),[18] and both studies show improved

nonsquamous), as well as increased durable responses with atezolizumab in non-small-cell
lung cancer.

Of note, 17% of patients treated with docetaxel received subsequent cancer
immunotherapies, predominantly the PD-1-targeted therapy nivolumab. Given the survival
benefit provided by these agents in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung
cancer, this might have resulted in increased survival in the docetaxel group and a
diminution in measured overall survival difference between groups.


Consistent with the POPLAR study, patients with tumours expressing high levels of PD-L1
(TC3 or IC3) derived the greatest benefit from atezolizumab. In this study, overall survival
was also improved in patients with less than 1% PD-L1 expression (ie, TC0 and IC0
subgroup). These immunohistochemistry data are supported by a similar overall survival
benefit noted in patients with low PD-L1 levels by gene expression analysis. By contrast, the
proportion of TC0 and IC0 patients with an objective response is lower than that in those
patients with higher PD-L1 expression, which is consistent with what was reported for antiPD-1 inhibitors and in previous atezolizumab studies. Because low PD-L1 expression is
associated with weak or no preexisting anticancer immunity,[18] this observed survival benefit
associated with atezolizumab in patients who are PD-L1-negative warrants additional
investigation to better understand the mechanisms of response to therapy in this patient
population. These include the biological hypothesis that atezolizumab increases anticancer
immunity through enhanced priming of new anticancer immune responses.

The overall survival HRs favoured atezolizumab over docetaxel across other clinical
subgroups, including the never smokers population. Although the confidence intervals for
HR in this subgroup were too wide to show a conclusive benefit, this finding supports
further evaluation given the low mutational heterogeneity and immunogenicity as well as
minimal activity noted with PD-1 inhibitors in this population. In contrast to observations in
PD-1 inhibitor studies,[2,3] patients with treated CNS metastases at baseline seemed to derive
benefit from atezolizumab treatment. Conversely, patients with EGFR mutation-positive
disease received similar overall survival benefit with atezolizumab and docetaxel. This
finding is similar to results reported with anti-PD-1 treatment in this clinical setting[3] and
might suggest decreased immunogenicity in this subgroup of patients. Subgroup analyses
were not powered for formal efficacy comparisons and should be interpreted with caution.


As seen in other trials with PD-L1 and PD-1 antibodies,[2–4,18] progression-free survival and
the proportion of patients with an objective response in the ITT population were not
improved with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel in OAK. The apparent discordance
between progression-free survival and overall survival might be due to an initial increase in
tumour volume from increased immune infiltration, delayed antitumour activity, or
antitumour immune activation beyond progression that might be sustained by continued
treatment.[21] This discordance has been commonly observed in studies of this drug class. As
such, at least for patients with lower PD-L1 expression levels, these data confirm that
progression-free survival results underestimate the clinical benefit measured by overall
survival for atezolizumab. The concept of post-progression prolongation of survival has been

previously introduced for EGFR inhibitor therapies[22] and the OAK results imply that this
effect can occur with atezolizumab treatment. These observations also support further
evaluation of the benefit and risk of continuing atezolizumab treatment until loss of clinical
benefit.[22]

Overall, atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a favourable adverse event profile compared
with docetaxel, and observed adverse events were consistent with those previously reported
with atezolizumab.[18] The proportion of patients who experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse
events, treatment-related adverse events, and those leading to discontinuation of study
treatment was lower with atezolizumab than with docetaxel. The incidence of specific
immune-related adverse events was low, including pneumonitis (with 1% overall occurrence
and less than 1% being grade 3, with no grade 4 events), which is of particular relevance to
patients with lung cancer.


In conclusion, this phase 3 study of a PD-L1-directed antibody, atezolizumab, shows a
clinically meaningful survival benefit over docetaxel in previously treated patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer regardless of PD-L1 expression or histology, with a favourable safety
profile compared with docetaxel. These clinically relevant data support atezolizumab as a
new treatment option for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer whose disease
has progressed during or after platinum-based chemotherapy.
