### Summary
**Background Ipilimumab is an approved treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. We aimed to assess**
**ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence.**

**Methods We did a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding lymph node**
**metastasis ≤1 mm or in-transit metastasis) with adequate resection of lymph nodes (ie, the primary cutaneous melanoma**
**must have been completely excised with adequate surgical margins) who had not received previous systemic therapy for**
**melanoma from 91 hospitals located in 19 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally by an interactive**
**voice response system, to receive intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for four**
**doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years. Using a minimisation technique, randomisation was stratifi ed by disease**
**stage and geographical region. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, assessed by an independent review**
**committee, and analysed by intention to treat. Enrollment is complete but the study is ongoing for follow-up for analysis**
**of secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number**
**NCT00636168.**

**Findings Between July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab (n=475) or**
**placebo (n=476), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. At a median follow-up of 2·74 years**
**(IQR 2·28–3·22), there were 528 recurrence-free survival events (234 in the ipilimumab group vs 294 in the placebo**
**group). Median recurrence-free survival was 26·1 months (95% CI 19·3–39·3) in the ipilimumab group versus**
**17·1 months (95% CI 13·4–21·6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·75; 95% CI 0·64–0·90; p=0·0013); 3-year**
**recurrence-free survival was 46·5% (95% CI 41·5–51·3) in the ipilimumab group versus 34·8% (30·1–39·5) in the**
**placebo group. The most common grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group were**
**gastrointestinal (75 [16%] vs** **four [<1%] in the placebo group), hepatic (50 [11%] vs one [<1%]), and endocrine (40 [8%]** **_vs_**
**none). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 245 (52%) of 471 patients who started ipilimumab**
**(182 [39%] during the initial treatment period of four doses). Five patients (1%) died due to drug-related adverse events.**
**Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients died because**
**of colitis (two with gastrointestinal perforation), one patient because of myocarditis, and one patient because of**
**multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barré syndrome.**

**Interpretation Adjuvant ipilimumab signifi cantly improved recurrence-free survival for patients with completely**
**resected high-risk stage III melanoma. The adverse event profi le was consistent with that observed in advanced**
**melanoma, but at higher incidences in particular for endocrinopathies. The risk–benefi t ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab**
**at this dose and schedule requires additional assessment based on distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival**
**endpoints to defi ne its defi nitive value.**

### Introduction
The rapidly rising incidence of cutaneous melanoma has
also led to an increased number of patients with regional
positive lymph nodes (stage III disease) being diagnosed
each year.[1] Breslow thickness, mitotic index, and ulceration
of primary melanoma are the strongest prognostic factors
for the presence of micrometastasis in regional lymph
nodes.[2] The likelihood of systemic metastatic disease in
patients with regional lymph node metastasis is closely
associated with microscopic versus palpable nodal disease


and with number of positive nodes.[3] In an analysis of
3307 patients by the American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC),[2] 5-year melanoma-specifi c survival was 78% for
stage IIIA, 59% for stage IIIB, and 40% for stage IIIC
melanoma. Recurrence at 5 years has been reported to be
37% in patients with stage IIIA disease, 68% for IIIB
disease, and 89% for patients with stage IIIC disease.[4]
Even within the sentinel node-positive patient population,
heterogeneity is remarkable and is closely associated with
tumour load in the sentinel node as defined by the

Rotterdam criteria.[5–7] Patients with a metastasis bigger
than 1 mm have a highly signifi cant increased risk of
recurrence and death than do patients with a metastasis
1 mm or smaller.[5–7]

Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that
blocks CTLA-4 to augment anti-tumour immune
responses, is an approved treatment for advanced
melanoma because of its eff ect on overall survival.[8–10]
The unmet need for an improved adjuvant treatment
for melanoma is shown by the hazard ratio (HR) for
recurrence or death of 0·83–0·85 with high-dose or
low-dose interferon compared with observation only.[11]
Interferon is approved in both the USA and the EU as
an adjuvant therapy for resected melanoma; however,
the treatment is not widely regarded as the standard of
care. In the current context of only marginally eff ective
adjuvant therapies with interferons, without a demonstrable dose–response or duration–response eff ect
in meta-analyses,[11–13] the study of ipilimumab in the
adjuvant setting is appropriate.
Here, we report results from the European
Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer
(EORTC) 18071 trial of adjuvant ipilimumab in high-risk
patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma after
having undergone a complete regional lymph node
dissection.

### Methods
#### Study design and patients
In this multinational, randomised, double-blind, phase 3
trial done in 91 hospitals located in 19 countries, eligible
patients were at least 18 years of age and had histologically
confi rmed melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes only.
According to the AJCC 2009 (for stage III identical to
AJCC 2002) classifi cation, patients had to have either
stage IIIA melanoma (if N1a, at least 1 metastasis
>1 mm) stage IIIB or stage IIIC with no in-transit


**Research in context**

**Systematic review**
The fi nal protocol for this trial was submitted in January, 2008.
In the preceding 2 years we assessed the scientifi c literature,
restricted to English language publications, on PubMed
(1980–2007), on adjuvant therapy in melanoma in patients
with high risk for recurrence. A simple literature search using
the search terms “melanoma”, “adjuvant therapy”, and
“randomised trial” provided all relevant studies.

**Added value of the study**
This trial is, to the best of our knowledge, the fi rst to assess an
approved drug with an eff ect on survival in advanced
melanoma in the adjuvant setting, and the fi rst to study an
immune checkpoint inhibitor in this setting. Our fi ndings show
that adjuvant use of ipilimumab has a signifi cant eff ect on
recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-treat population.


We noted effi cacy of the treatment across subgroups including
those with palpable lymph nodes. Nevertheless, our results
show important side-eff ects, in particular grade 3–4 colitis and
hypophysitis. Our data neither support nor refute the need for
maintenance treatment with ipilimumab. However, the eff ect
on recurrence-free survival is potentially better than that of
adjuvant interferon.

**Interpretation**
Ipilimumab is an active drug in the adjuvant setting in patients
with high-risk disease, although side-eff ects are signifi cant. In
view of its activity across subgroups including those with high
tumour burden, it represents an option in the current adjuvant
landscape for those who have experience with administering the
drug. Overall survival data are not yet mature and will be reported
in the future.


metastasis.[2 ] The primary cutaneous melanoma must
have been completely excised with adequate surgical
margins. Complete regional lympha denectomy was
required within the 12 weeks before randomisation.
Exclusion criteria included unknown primary, ocular, or
mucosal melanoma, Eastern Co operative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status greater than 1,
autoimmune disease, uncontrolled infections, cardiovascular disease, white blood cell count lower than
2·5 × 10⁹ cells per L, absolute neutrophil count lower than
1·0 × 10[9] cells per L, platelets lower than 75 × 10⁹ cells per
L, haemoglobin con centration less than 9 g/dL, creatinine
higher than 2·5 times the upper normal limit, hepatic
enzymes or lactate dehydrogenase higher than two times
the upper normal limit, use of systemic corticosteroids,
and previous systemic therapy for melanoma.
The protocol (appendix) was approved by the EORTC
protocol review committee and independent ethics
committees. The study was done in accordance with the
ethical principles originating from the Declaration of
Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice as defi ned by
the International Conference on Harmonization. All
participating patients gave written informed consent.

#### Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either
ipilimumab or placebo (appendix). Registration was
done centrally at the EORTC head quarters. We used a
central interactive voice response system (Worldwide
Clinical Trials, Beverly Hills, CA, USA) for drug
accountability and central randomisation, based on a
minimisation technique.[14] Patients were stratifi ed by
disease stage (stage IIIA vs stage IIIB vs stage IIIC with one
to three positive nodes _vs stage IIIC with four or more_
positive nodes) and regions (North America, European
countries, and Australia). The local pharmacist did the
randomisation and was unmasked for allocated treatment


-----

Clinical investigators and those collecting or analysing the
data were masked to treatment group assignment.

#### Procedures
Patients received either intravenous infusions of
10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses, then
every 3 months for up to a maximum of 3 years, or until
disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, major protocol
violation, or treatment refusal. After the initial four
doses (induction) of ipilimumab or placebo, additional
therapy (maintenance) was added based on the
theoretical principles of continued re-stimulation of the
immune system, consistent with previous studies of
immunotherapy in adjuvant melanoma.[12] Rules
regarding the withholding of a dose of ipilimumab or
placebo and management of immune-related adverse
events are detailed in the protocol (appendix).
Patients in both study groups were planned to be
assessed for recurrence and distant metastases every
3 months during the fi rst 3 years and every 6 months
thereafter. Physical examination, chest radiography, CT,
or other imaging techniques were used as clinically
indicated. Patients were assessed at baseline during the
screening phase, within maximum 6 weeks before
randomisation. Recurrence or metastatic lesions had to
be histologically confi rmed whenever possible. The
fi rst date when recurrence was observed irrespective of
the method of assessment. An independent review
committee, whose members were kept masked of
study-group assignments, assessed disease status and
date of recurrence.

#### Outcomes
The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, as
assessed by the independent review committee.
Secondary endpoints were distant-metastasis free survival
(also assessed by the independent review committee;
appendix), overall survival, adverse event profi le, and
health-related quality of life (assessed with EORTC
QLQ-C30 instrument). Recurrence-free survival was
defi ned as the time between the date of randomisation
and the date of fi rst recurrence (local, regional, or distant
metastasis) or death (whatever the cause), whichever
occurred fi rst. For patients still alive and without disease
recurrence, recurrence-free survival was censored on the
date of last disease assessment.
We recorded adverse events for each treatment course
with the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0). Based on the
report by the local investigator of each adverse event,
MedDRA recoding was done during the course of the
study. Immune-related adverse events were
programmatically established from a predefi ned list of
MedDRA terms, which was updated according to each
version of MedDRA. Safety analyses were done in all
patients who were randomly assigned to treatment and
received at least one dose of study drug (safety population)


Resolution of a grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse
event was defi ned as an improvement to grade 1 or less,
or to the worst grade at baseline. Some patients with
grade 1 adverse events were permitted to receive
maintenance therapy (criteria shown in protocol). The
grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse event with the
longest time to resolution was selected for inclusion in
the analysis. If the grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse
event did not resolve, the patient’s follow-up was censored
at the last known alive date. Similar analyses were
repeated for grade 2–5 immune-related adverse events.

#### Statistical analysis
512 recurrence-free survival events were required to
provide 90% power to detect an ipilimumab versus
placebo HR of 0·75 (two-sided α of 0·05), corresponding
to an increase from 58·3% to 66·% in 1-year recurrencefree survival and from 35·4% to 45·9% in 3-year
recurrence-free survival. Therefore, 950 patients were
planned to be randomly assigned.

The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to obtain estimates
of the recurrence-free survival distributions, and the
95% CI of these estimates (–1·96 × standard error [SE],
1·96 × SE), where the SE was computed with the Greenwood
formula. Medians were presented with a 95% CI based on
the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. We compared the
recurrence-free survival distributions of the treatment
groups with a log-rank test at a two-sided alpha level of
0·05, stratifi ed by stage as indicated at randomisation. The
treatment HR for recurrence or death, and its 95% CI, was
estimated with a Cox proportional hazards model, stratifi ed
by stage as indicated at randomisation.
The main analysis of the effi cacy endpoint was by
intention to treat: all patients were deemed at risk of
having a recurrence-free survival event until the
respective event was reached; follow-up was not censored
on purpose for patients who went off -protocol treatment
because of, for example, protocol violation, toxicity, and
treatment refusal. Forest plot analyses and further
exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses were used to
investigate predictive importance of diff erent factors on
the treatment diff erence (appendix). Safety profi les were
assessed in patients who started treatment allocated by
randomisation, and no statistical inferences were done.

An independent data and safety monitoring board was
responsible for safeguarding the interests of patients,
assessing the safety data and monitoring the overall
conduct of the clinical study. Effi cacy was also reviewed by
the data and safety monitoring board, as part of the benefi tto-risk assessment, but no formal interim analyses were
performed before this fi nal recurrence-free survival
analysis. The board met twice a year after the fi rst
100 patients had been randomised and followed up for at
least 12 weeks. On-site source data verifi cation was
performed via a contract research organisation.
The clinical cutoff date for this analysis was
July 26, 2013, and the database was locked in
December, 2013. As per the recommendation of the data
and safety monitoring board, the study is ongoing for
the assessment of distant metastasis-free survival and
overall survival; both the investigators and the sponsor
remain masked to these data. All analyses were done
with SAS software (version 9.2 and 9.3, SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA). This trial is registered with EudraCT,
number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number
NCT00636168.

#### Role of the funding source
The funder and the sponsor of the trial was Bristol-Myers
Squibb. The trial was designed jointly by the members of
the writing committee (study coordinator, EORTC
Headquarters team and Bristol-Myers Squibb
representative). Data were collected and computerised at
the EORTC Headquarters, and were copied to BristolMyers Squibb after database lock. Data were analysed
independently at both the EORTC Headquarters (SS) and
by Bristol-Myers Squibb (VdP). An initial draft of the
manuscript was prepared by the study coordinator and the
EORTC trial statistician. All the authors participated in
the revision and fi nalisation of the manuscript, and made
the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.
After the database lock (ie, at time of fi nal analysis),
statisticians had full access to all the data; thereafter the
fi rst author (AMME) received the fi nal reports.

### Results
Between July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients
were randomly assigned (475 in the ipilimumab group
and 476 in the placebo group). Table 1 shows patient and
disease characteristics. Overall, 186 (20%) patients had
stage IIIA, 420 (44%) had stage IIIB, and 345 (36%) had
stage IIIC disease; 400 (42%) patients had an ulcerated
primary, and 548 (58%) had macroscopic lymph node
involvement.
Six patients did not start the allocated treatment by
randomisation (fi gure 1). Of the remaining patients, the
median number of doses received per patient in the
ipilimumab group was four (range 1–16) and eight
(range 1–16) in the placebo group. At least one
maintenance dose was received by 198 (42%) of
471 patients in the ipilimumab and 332 (70%) of


-----

474 patients in the placebo group. 136 (29%) of 471
patients in the ipilimumab group received at least seven
doses (about 1 year of treatment) compared with 269
(57%) of 474 in the placebo group.
Of 471 patients who started ipilimumab, 245 (52%)
discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, of
which 230 (49%) were drug-related; in 182 (39%) patients
the adverse event leading to discontinuation happened
within 12 weeks of the start of treatment. Of the
474 patients in the placebo group who received at least
one dose of assigned treatment, 20 (4%) discontinued
treatment because of an adverse event (fi gure 1).
132 (28%) patients discontinued ipilimumab because of
disease recurrence compared with 273 (58%) patients in
the placebo group. 33 (7%) patients in the ipilimumab
group and 77 (16%) in the placebo group completed the
entire 3-year treatment period; 39 (8%) patients in the
ipilimumab group and 80 (17%) in the placebo group
were still on treatment on July 26, 2013, the date of
clinical cutoff, respectively (fi gure 1). No dose reductions
or modifi cations were made. The overall median followup was 2·74 years (IQR 2·28–3·22), 2·60 years
(2·10–3·07) in the ipilimumab group and 2·76 years
(2·29–3·26) in the placebo group.
528 recurrence-free survival events were reported
(234 in the ipilimumab group and 294 in the placebo
group). Recurrence-free survival was signifi cantly longer
in the ipilimumab group than in the placebo group (HR,
stratifi ed by stage, 0·75, 95% CI 0·64–0·90; p=0·0013;
table 2 and fi gure 2). Median recurrence-free survival in
the ipilimumab group was 26·1 months (95% CI
19·3–39·3) versus 17·1 months (13·4–21·6) in the
placebo group; 3-year recurrence-free survival was 46·5%
(95% CI 41·5–51·3) in the ipilimumab group versus
34·8% (30·1–39·5) in the placebo group.
The eff ect of ipilimumab on recurrence-free survival
was consistent across subgroups (fi gure 3). An eff ect on
recurrence-free survival was noted irrespective of the
number of positive lymph nodes (fi gure 3), and seemed to
be higher in patients with an ulcerated melanoma than in
patients with a non-ulcerated melanoma, as suggested by
univariate analyses (present vs absent; test of heterogeneity
p=0·20; fi gure 3) and analyses stratifi ed by stage (table 3),
and confi rmed by multivariate analyses (appendix).
Therefore in these post-hoc analyses the effect of

ipilimumab was more prominent in the 345 patients with
stage IIIC disease (of whom 228 [66%] had ulcerated
melanoma) than in the 420 patients with stage IIIB
disease (of whom 172 [41%] had ulcerated melanoma), and
also than in the 196 patients with stage IIIA (none of
whom had ulcerated melanoma; fi gure 3). In patients
with microscopic involvement, the eff ect of ipilimumab
seemed higher than in patients with macroscopic
involvement, as indicated in univariate analyses (fi gure 3)
and analyses stratifi ed by stage (table 3).
Sensitivity analyses based on the per-protocol treatment
population, or using recurrence-free survival as reported by
the investigators, yielded similar results (appendix), as was
the case for treatment comparison stratifi ed by stage as
given on case report forms (HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·64–0·90;
p=0·002). Patients remain in follow-up for the endpoints of
distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival.
In the ipilimumab group, 465 (99%) of 471 patients had
an adverse event of any grade with grade 3 or 4 adverse

events in 254 (54%) patients; 432 (91%) of 474 patients in
the placebo group had an adverse event of any grade, with
grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in 118 (25%) patients
(table 4). On-study immune-related adverse events were
more frequently reported in the ipilimumab group than
in the placebo group (table 4). The most common grade
3–4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab
group were gastro intestinal, hepatic, and endocrine in
nature (table 4). For all classes, most patients had only
one episode of a grade 3–4 immune-related adverse event.
The median time to onset of on-study grade 2–5 immunerelated adverse events in the ipilimumab group ranged
from 4·3 weeks (IQR 1·1–10·6; skin immune-related
adverse events) to 13·1 weeks (8·3–77·3; neurological


immune-related adverse events; appendix). In the
ipilimumab group, excluding endocrine immune-related
adverse events, most grade 2–4 immune-related adverse
events (82–95%) resolved to baseline or grade 1 with
established management algorithms (protocol). The
median time to resolution ranged from 4·0 to 8·0 weeks.
Endocrine immune-related adverse events resolved in a
smaller proportion of ipilimumab-treated patients (75

[56%] of 134 patients) and took longer to resolve (median
31·1 weeks, IQR 8·3–77·3).
Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related
adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients
died because of colitis (two with gastrointestinal
perforation) one patient because of myocarditis and one


-----

patient because of multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barré
syndrome. These deaths occurred before the start of maintenance therapy Four patients received corticosteroids and


one anti-TNF antibodies. No deaths were deemed to be
treatment related in the placebo group. Quality of life data
will be presented in another report

### Discussion
Our data show that 10 mg/kg ipilimumab for up to 3
years as adjuvant treatment in patients with adequate
resection of lymph nodes and high-risk stage III
melanoma signifi cantly improved recurrence-free
survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, compared
with use of adjuvant placebo. Patients remain in followup for the secondary endpoints of distant metastasisfree survival and overall survival.
The dose of 10 mg/kg was chosen based on data from
a randomised phase 2 trial[15] that compared various
doses of ipilimumab in patients with advanced
melanoma, showing the best results with 10 mg/kg.
This dose is substantially higher than the approved dose
of 3 mg/kg for the treatment of patients with advanced
melanoma.[8] The ongoing intergroup trial ECOG 1609
(NCT 01274338) in the USA comparing high-dose
interferon treatment with 1 year of treatment with
ipilimumab at either 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg might
provide additional insight as to whether the higher dose
of ipilimumab provides additional benefi ts compared
with the standard dose of ipilimumab used for
unresectable metastatic disease, and whether either
dose of ipilimumab improves outcomes or is less toxic
than high-dose interferon.
Recently, several predictive factors for the effi cacy of
interferon in the adjuvant setting for high-risk
melanoma have been identifi ed. In the EORTC 18952
trial, which compared intermediate doses of interferon
as adjuvant treatment with observation, and in the
EORTC 18991 trial of adjuvant pegylated interferon
versus observation, patients were stratifi ed by nodal
status: microscopic only (sentinel node-positive) versus
macroscopic or palpable, and by the presence of
ulceration of the primary.[16–18] The importance of
microscopic versus macroscopic nodal involvement and
the presence or absence of ulceration of the primary
have been clearly shown in a meta-analysis of these two
trials in 2644 patients[19] and was confi rmed by long-term
data—ie, overall survival in the EORTC 18991 trial.[18]
Moreover, the overriding importance of ulceration has
been shown in an individual patient data meta-analysis
of 15 trials of adjuvant interferon versus observation.[11]

We noted similar trends in this trial. Analyses,
stratifi ed by stage at randomisation, suggested that
patients with microscopic involvement only might have
a greater benefi t than patients with palpable nodes. But
importantly, with ipilimumab, the benefi t was still
substantial in the latter subgroup, whereas this was not
the case in the EORTC interferon trials. Similarly,
patients with an ulcerated melanoma seemed to benefi t
from ipilimumab more than patients with a nonulcerated primary. By contrast with interferon, the eff ect
of ipilimumab is still substantial in the latter subgroup.
When these two important determinants were
combined, analyses stratifi ed by stage suggested that the
benefit in patients with microscopic nodal involvement


with an ulcerated primary appeared greatest, followed by
that observed in patients with palpable nodes with an
ulcerated primary, or in patients with microscopic nodal
involvement and an non-ulcerated primary, whereas in
patients with palpable nodes and a non-ulcerated
primary the benefi t was the lowest (table 3).
In patients with stage IIIA disease with limited
microscopic nodal involvement, who, by defi nition, have
a non-ulcerated primary, there was a suggestion of only
limited benefi t (HR 0·91, 99% CI 0·49–1·68), whereas in
those with stage IIIB (HR 0·61, 0·35–1·04) or IIIC (HR
0·42, 0·16–1·12) the eff ect was important (appendix).
These observations suggest that ulcerated melanoma is a
separate biological entity, for which a number of
additional observations have been reported in terms of
stromal components, gene profi ling, and immunesuppressed status of associated sentinel nodes.[20–23]

The adverse event profi le of ipilimumab in the adjuvant
setting is substantial, resulting in around 40% of patients
discontinuing treatment by the end of the initial dosing
period—ie, before maintenance therapy. This is a higher
frequency than has been observed in a pooled analysis of
studies with the dose of 10 mg/kg in patients with advanced
melanoma.[10] Whether this is due to longer drug exposure,
or to a greater sensitivity in stage III disease remains
speculative. Most immune-related dermatological, gastrointestinal, and hepatic manifestations resolved within
4–6 weeks, but for endocrinopathies the median time to
resolution was 31 weeks, with 59 (44%) of 134 patients
remaining on hormone replacement therapies. Of concern
are the drug-related fatalities in the ipilimumab group.
Eff ective management of ipilimumab-related immunerelated adverse events is complex and requires proactive
monitoring, early intervention, and aggressive immunosuppressive management and meticulous instruction of
patients. Of note, of the fi ve (1%) patients who died due to
drug-related causes after discontinuation of ipilimumab,
four received corticosteroids and only one received antiTNF antibodies; we do not know whether the lack of
administration of corticosteroids in one patient and of
anti-TNF antibodies in four patients would have changed
the outcome.
Adjuvant ipilimumab therapy for patients with highrisk stage III melanoma clearly improves recurrence-free
survival. We noted effi cacy of the treatment across
subgroups including those with high tumour burden.
The risk–benefi t ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab at this dose
and schedule requires additional assessment based on
distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival
endpoints to defi ne its defi nitive value.
