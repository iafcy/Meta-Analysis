**BACKGROUND**
An earlier analysis in this phase 3 trial showed that durvalumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with placebo, among patients with
stage III, unresectable non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not have disease
progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Here we report the results for the
second primary end point of overall survival.

**METHODS**
We randomly assigned patients, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive durvalumab intravenously,
at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, or matching placebo every 2 weeks
for up to 12 months. Randomization occurred 1 to 42 days after the patients had
received chemoradiotherapy and was stratified according to age, sex, and smoking
history. The primary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by blinded
independent central review) and overall survival. Secondary end points included the
time to death or distant metastasis, the time to second progression, and safety.

**RESULTS**
Of the 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received the assigned intervention (473 patients received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). As of March 22,
2018, the median follow-up was 25.2 months. The 24-month overall survival rate was
66.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.7 to 70.4) in the durvalumab group, as compared with 55.6% (95% CI, 48.9 to 61.8) in the placebo group (two-sided P = 0.005).
Durvalumab significantly prolonged overall survival, as compared with placebo
(stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.68; 99.73% CI, 0.47 to 0.997; P = 0.0025). Updated
analyses regarding progression-free survival were similar to those previously reported,
with a median duration of 17.2 months in the durvalumab group and 5.6 months in
the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51;
95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63). The median time to death or distant metastasis was 28.3 months
in the durvalumab group and 16.2 months in the placebo group (stratified hazard
ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68). A total of 30.5% of the patients in the durvalumab
group and 26.1% of those in the placebo group had grade 3 or 4 adverse events of
any cause; 15.4% and 9.8% of the patients, respectively, discontinued the trial regimen because of adverse events.

**CONCLUSIONS**
Durvalumab therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than placebo.
No new safety signals were identified. (Funded by AstraZeneca; PACIFIC ClinicalTrials

istorically, patients with a good
performance status and stage III (locally
advanced), unresectable non–small-cell

# Hlung cancer (NSCLC) have been treated with

platinum-based, doublet chemotherapy administered with definitive-dose radiotherapy (concurrent
chemoradiotherapy).[1] However, outcomes have
been poor because most patients have disease progression after chemoradiotherapy, with approximately 15 to 30% of patients remaining alive at
5 years, which corresponds to a median survival
of no more than 28 months.[1,2] Several studies have
tested the administration of systemic therapy with
curative intent after patients had disease control
with chemoradiotherapy. However, to date, these
therapies have proved ineffective, with a median
survival after consolidation treatment ranging
from 18 to 23 months.[3-7]

Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed death 1 (PD-1) and programmed death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) have shown activity in the treatment of numerous cancers, including advanced
NSCLC.[8,9] Durvalumab is a selective, high-affinity,
engineered, human IgG1 monoclonal antibody
that blocks PD-L1 binding to PD-1 and CD80,
allowing T cells to recognize and kill tumor
cells.[10,11] Preclinical evidence suggests that chemoradiotherapy may up-regulate PD-L1 expression in
tumor cells,[11-17] and it is hypothesized that PD-L1
blockade may help restore systemic and long-term
immune response after chemoradiotherapy.
PACIFIC was a randomized, placebo-controlled,
phase 3 trial evaluating the immune checkpoint
inhibitor durvalumab in patients with stage III,
unresectable NSCLC who did not have disease
progression after concurrent chemoradiotherapy.[18]
At the first planned interim analysis, the trial
showed that durvalumab significantly prolonged
progression-free survival (one of the two primary
end points), as compared with placebo, with median durations of 16.8 months (95% confidence
interval [CI], 13.0 to 18.1) and 5.6 months (95% CI,
4.6 to 7.8), respectively (stratified hazard ratio for
disease progression or death, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.42
to 0.65; P<0.001).[18] On the basis of these results,
durvalumab was approved for the treatment of
unresectable, stage III NSCLC in patients whose
disease had not progressed after platinum-based
chemoradiotherapy.[19,20]

Here, we report the results for the second primary end point of overall survival in the PACIFIC
trial. Updated results for progression-free survival


**Patients**
Eligibility criteria, as reported previously,[18] included histologically or cytologically documented
stage III, unresectable NSCLC according to the
_Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology, version 7, of the_
International Association for the Study of Lung
Cancer.[21] Patients also had to have received at least
two cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy (containing etoposide, vinblastine, vinorelbine, a taxane [paclitaxel or docetaxel], or pemetrexed) concurrently with definitive radiation therapy.[18] Eligible
patients must not have had progression after
chemoradiotherapy and had to have received their
last radiation dose within 1 to 42 days before randomization. (Details are provided in the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary
Appendix, available with the full text of this article
at NEJM.org.)

**Trial Design and Interventions**
This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was conducted at
235 investigative sites in 26 countries, including
centers in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America,
South America, and South Africa. Patients were
randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive durvalumab intravenously, at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight, or matching placebo every
2 weeks up to 12 months or until confirmed disease progression, the initiation of alternative cancer therapy, unacceptable toxic events, or withdrawal of consent. Randomization was stratified
according to age of the patient (<65 years vs. ≥65
years), sex, and smoking history (current or former smoker vs. never smoked). After the discontinuation or completion of the trial regimen, patients were followed for survival. Patients could
receive their assigned trial regimen again if disease
control had occurred at the end of 12 months
and if progression occurred during follow-up.

**End Points and Assessments**
The primary end points were overall survival and
progression-free survival, assessed according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), version 1.1, and evaluated by means of
blinded independent central review. Overall sur

and for secondary efficacy and safety end points
are also reported.

vival was defined as the time from randomization
until death from any cause. Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization
until the date of objective disease progression or
death from any cause in the absence of progression.
Secondary efficacy end points included the rate
of overall survival at 24 months after randomization, the objective response rate, duration of response, the rates of progression-free survival at
12 and 18 months, the time to death or distant
metastasis (defined as any new lesion outside the
radiation field, according to RECIST, version 1.1,
or proven by biopsy) (see the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix), and
the time to second progression (defined as the
time from randomization to the earliest of the
progression events subsequent to that used for
the analysis of progression-free survival). The time
to second progression was defined according to
local standard practice and assessed by investigators and could include any of the following: objective assessment of progression as assessed radiologically, symptomatic progression, or death. The
time to the first subsequent therapy or death and
the time to the second subsequent therapy or death
were supportive assessments for progression-free
survival and the time to second progression, respectively.
In addition to the estimates for progressionfree survival, the objective response rate, duration
of response, and the time to death or distant metastasis were based on RECIST, version 1.1, according to blinded independent central review assessments. RECIST assessments were not collected
for the analysis of time to second progression.
Efficacy was assessed every 8 weeks for the first
12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. All reported efficacy end points are for durvalumab or
placebo only and were derived from the time of
randomization (i.e., did not include the previous
chemoradiotherapy period).
Safety assessments included adverse events,
serious adverse events, vital signs, and physical
and laboratory examinations. Also assessed were
adverse events of special interest and immunemediated adverse events, which were defined as
adverse events of special interest that led to the use
of systemic glucocorticoids, endocrine therapy, or
other immunosuppressants, that were consistent
with an immune-mediated mechanism, and that
had no clear alternative cause. Adverse events and
serious adverse events were classified according


to system organ class and preferred term in the
_Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 19.1,_
and were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03.
Patients provided archived tumor tissue samples (if available), which had been obtained before
chemoradiotherapy, for PD-L1 testing with the use
of the Ventana SP263 immunohistochemical assay. However, patients were enrolled regardless of
PD-L1 expression status. Prespecified analyses of
outcomes as a function of PD-L1 expression levels
on tumor cells with the use of a 25% cutoff were
conducted. In addition, at the request of health
regulatory authorities, an exploratory post hoc
analysis was conducted that used a PD-L1 expression-level cutoff of 1%. (An additional PD-L1 subgroup with a cutoff of 1 to 24% was also analyzed;
see the Supplementary Appendix.)

**Trial Oversight**
As reported previously,[18] the trial was designed
by representatives of the sponsor (AstraZeneca)
and academic advisors. The trial was conducted
in accordance with ethical principles that have
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and
are consistent with the International Council on
Harmonisation guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with any applicable laws and requirements,
and with any conditions that were required by a
regulatory authority, institutional review board,
or independent ethics committee that had approved this trial to be conducted in its territory.
(For details, see the Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix.)
The data were collected and analyzed by the
sponsor after review and a recommendation by
the independent data and safety monitoring committee to unblind the data. The manuscript was
written by the authors, with editorial assistance
funded by the sponsor and conducted in accordance with Good Publication Practice guidelines.
The authors had access to the data and vouch for
the accuracy and completeness of the data and
analyses and for the adherence of the trial to the
protocol, available at NEJM.org.

**Statistical Analysis**
The sample size that was required for the analysis
of the primary end points and the statistical methods have been described previously.[18] For overall
survival, the final analysis was planned to be conducted when approximately 491 deaths had oc

curred among 713 patients who had undergone
randomization (69% maturity). If the true hazard
ratio for death in the analysis of overall survival
was 0.73, this number of deaths would provide the
trial with at least 85% power to show a significant
difference, assuming a 2.5% two-sided significance level in the intention-to-treat population;
this translates to an 8-month benefit in the median overall survival in the durvalumab group over
22 months in the placebo group (i.e., 30 months
in the durvalumab group) if overall survival is exponentially distributed. In addition, two interim
analyses for overall survival were planned to be
conducted when approximately 285 and 393 deaths
had occurred. The Lan–DeMets spending function
that approximates an O’Brien−Fleming approach
was used to account for multiple comparisons,
which were introduced by including interim analyses for superiority.[22]

The data cutoff for the first interim analysis
of overall survival occurred on March 22, 2018,
after 299 deaths had occurred (61% of the expected
491 events). The results of this interim analysis
were reviewed by an independent data and safety
monitoring committee that concluded that the
prespecified criteria for unblinding of the data had
been fulfilled (i.e., that the P value had crossed
the efficacy boundary of 0.00274) and recommended unblinding of the data. Since the trial
reached statistical significance on the basis of
this interim analysis, the results presented herein are to be considered final for overall survival.
Analyses of the efficacy end points included
all the patients who underwent randomization,
according to the intention-to-treat principle. For
time-to-event end points, such as progression-free
survival and overall survival, the effect of durvalumab as compared with placebo was estimated
by the hazard ratio (together with its corresponding confidence interval of 100 [1 − α]%, with adjustment for the interim analysis, or with a 95%
confidence interval and P value) in the intentionto-treat population. Between-group comparisons
were performed by a stratified log-rank test; the
stratification factors were those that had been used
for randomization (age, sex, and smoking history).
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate
medians and their associated 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity analyses for overall survival included the assessment of attrition bias.
For all the planned analyses of overall survival
in prespecified subgroups, an unstratified Cox re

gression model was used to calculate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. No adjustment
for multiple comparisons was planned for these
subgroup analyses. Response rates were estimated with the use of the Clopper–Pearson method
and compared with the use of Fisher’s exact test.
The type I error was controlled for the primary end
points, the overall survival rate at 24 months, and
the objective response rate, as described previously,[18] but not for other secondary end points;
therefore, P values are not reported. Safety data
were summarized for the as-treated population.
Details are provided in the statistical analysis
plan, which is available with the protocol.


**Patients and Trial Interventions**
From May 2014 through April 2016, a total of
713 patients underwent randomization, of whom
709 (99.4%) received at least one dose of durvalumab or placebo after chemoradiotherapy (473
patients received durvalumab and 236 received
placebo) (Fig. 1). A summary of the demographic
and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary
Appendix. As previously reported,[18] the baseline
characteristics were well balanced between the
trial groups.
As of March 22, 2018, which was the datacutoff date for this analysis, 299 patients (183 in
the durvalumab group and 116 in the placebo
group) had died. The overall median duration of
follow-up for overall survival was 25.2 months
(range, 0.2 to 43.1). The median number of infusions received was 20 (range, 1 to 27) in the durvalumab group and 14 (range, 1 to 26) in the
placebo group. The median duration of receipt of
the trial intervention was 40.1 weeks (range, 1 to
54) in the durvalumab group and 28.0 weeks
(range, 1 to 53) in the placebo group.
After discontinuation of the intervention, 195
patients (41.0%) in the durvalumab group and 128
(54.0%) in the placebo group received subsequent
disease-related anticancer therapy (Table S2 in
the Supplementary Appendix). A total of 128 patients in the durvalumab group (26.9%) and 71 in
the placebo group (30.0%) received subsequent
cytotoxic chemotherapy; 38 patients (8.0%) and
53 (22.4%), respectively, received additional immunotherapy, and 47 (9.9%) and 31 (13.1%) received
subsequent (non–immunotherapy-based) targeted

therapy. In addition, 82 patients (17.2%) in the
durvalumab group and 56 (23.6%) in the placebo
group received subsequent radiotherapy.

**Efficacy**
The 12-month overall survival rate was 83.1%
(95% CI, 79.4 to 86.2) in the durvalumab group,
as compared with 75.3% (95% CI, 69.2 to 80.4) in
the placebo group. The 24-month overall survival
rate was 66.3% (95% CI, 61.7 to 70.4) in the durvalumab group, as compared with 55.6% (95% CI,
48.9 to 61.8) in the placebo group (two-sided
P = 0.005). Durvalumab significantly prolonged
overall survival, as compared with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.68; 99.73% CI,
0.47 to 0.997; P = 0.0025) (Fig. 2). The overall survival benefit with durvalumab was observed across
all the prespecified subgroups, as defined according to the demographic characteristics of the patients, baseline clinicopathologic features, and
response to previous treatment (Fig. S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix).
At the time of data cutoff, the median progression-free survival from randomization, according
to blinded independent central review, was 17.2
months (95% CI, 13.1 to 23.9) in the durvalumab
group, as compared with 5.6 months (95% CI,
4.6 to 7.7) in the placebo group (stratified hazard
ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51;
95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The results of exploratory post hoc
analyses of progression-free survival and overall
survival among patients with different PD-L1 expression levels (on the basis of archived tumor
samples obtained before chemoradiotherapy [if
available]) are shown in Figure S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. (Further information is provided in the Supplementary Discussion section in
the Supplementary Appendix.)
In the updated analysis, the time to death or
distant metastasis was longer in the durvalumab
group than in the placebo group (median, 28.3
months [95% CI, 24.0 to 34.9] vs. 16.2 months

[95% CI, 12.5 to 21.1]; stratified hazard ratio, 0.53;
95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68) (Fig. 3). In addition, the updated frequency of new lesions, as assessed by
blinded independent central review, was 22.5% in
the durvalumab group and 33.8% in the placebo
group, with a lower incidence of new brain metastases in the durvalumab group than in the placebo
group (6.3% vs. 11.8%) (Table 1). As of the datacutoff date, a second progression event or death


occurred in 361 patients (217 in the durvalumab
group and 144 in the placebo group). The time to
second progression or death as assessed by the
investigators according to local standard practice
was longer in the durvalumab group than in the
placebo group (median, 28.3 months [95% CI,
25.1 to 34.7] vs. 17.1 months [95% CI, 14.5 to 20.7];
stratified hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.73)

to the first subsequent therapy or death as well
as the time to the second subsequent therapy or
death were also longer in the durvalumab group
than in the placebo group (Figs. S5 and S6 in the
Supplementary Appendix).
In the updated analyses, the overall response
rate was 30.0% (95% CI, 25.8 to 34.5) in the
durvalumab group, as compared with 17.8%
(95% CI, 13.0 to 23.6) in the placebo group
(P<0.001) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median duration of response was
not reached (95% CI, 27.4 months to not reached)
in the durvalumab group and was 18.4 months
(95% CI, 6.7 to 24.5) in the placebo group (Table
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among patients who had a response, 73.5% of those in
the durvalumab group had an ongoing response
at 18 months, as compared with 52.2% in the
placebo group (Table S3 in the Supplementary
Appendix).


**Safety**
As of the new data-cutoff date, the safety profiles of durvalumab and placebo were consistent
with those previously reported (Table S4 in the
Supplementary Appendix).[18] Maximum-grade 3 or
4 adverse events of any cause occurred in 30.5%
of the patients in the durvalumab group and in
26.1% of those in the placebo group. Discontinuation of the trial regimen because of adverse events
occurred in 15.4% of the patients in the durvalumab group and in 9.8% of those in the placebo group. The most frequent adverse events
leading to the discontinuation of the trial regimen were pneumonitis (in 4.8% of the patients
in the durvalumab group and in 2.6% of those in
the placebo group), radiation pneumonitis (in 1.3%
and 1.3%, respectively), and pneumonia (in 1.1%
and 1.3%).
Serious adverse events occurred in 29.1% of the
patients in the durvalumab group and in 23.1%

of those in the placebo group, and death due to
adverse events occurred in 4.4% and 6.4%, respectively. Adverse events of special interest that were
of any grade or cause were reported in 66.7% of
the patients in the durvalumab group and in 49.1%
of those in the placebo group, with 56.8% and
43.6% of patients, respectively, reporting grade 1 or
2 events.


Discussion


In this updated analysis of the PACIFIC trial, the
primary end point of overall survival was significantly longer with durvalumab than with placebo
among patients with unresectable, stage III NSCLC.
With the between-group difference in median
progression-free survival remaining more than
11 months, the results of the analysis of overall
survival indicate that the progression-free survival
benefit has translated to a significant prolongation in overall survival. This result is consistent
with previously reported associations between pro

gression-free survival and overall survival among
patients with stage III NSCLC.[23] Moreover, the
prolongation of overall survival with durvalumab
was observed in all the prespecified subgroups.
The updated results for secondary end points,
including the time to death or distant metastasis,
the incidence of new lesions, and the objective
response rate, remain consistent with those that
were previously reported[18] and continue to show
the substantial anticancer activity of durvalumab
treatment in patients after induction therapy and
its favorable effect on preventing metastatic spread,
which may help to explain the observed survival
benefit. In addition, durvalumab therapy resulted
in a longer time to second progression or death
than placebo, as well as longer times to the first
subsequent therapy or death and to the second
subsequent therapy or death — results that show
the long-term benefit of durvalumab treatment.
No new safety signals were identified after
further follow-up. These findings help to define
the safety profile of durvalumab use after chemo

radiotherapy, despite the trial being limited in its
ability to distinguish or assign causality for some
adverse events or to identify risk factors for their
occurrence, owing to incomplete data regarding
previous treatment.
In conclusion, this trial showed a survival advantage with durvalumab therapy after concurrent
chemoradiation therapy in patients with stage III,
unresectable NSCLC.
