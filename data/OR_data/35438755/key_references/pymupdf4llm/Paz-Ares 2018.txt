**BACKGROUND**
Standard first-line therapy for metastatic, squamous non–small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is platinum-based chemotherapy or pembrolizumab (for patients with programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression on ≥50% of tumor cells). More recently,
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall survival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.

**METHODS**
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients
with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab
or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and
either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]–paclitaxel for the first 4 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.

**RESULTS**
After a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination
group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall survival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median
progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumabcombination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination
group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70;
P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in
the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebocombination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more
frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination
group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).

**CONCLUSIONS**
In patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of
pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel
resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme; KEYNOTE-407 ClinicalTrials.gov

quamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately
20 to 30% of all lung cancers and is associ
# Sated with shorter survival than is nonsquamous

NSCLC.[1-4] Historically, the lack of targetable aberrations meant that treatment for squamous NSCLC
was mostly limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The
combination of the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor necitumumab and chemotherapy
with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the first-line
treatment of squamous NSCLC significantly prolonged overall survival, as compared with chemotherapy alone, but the magnitude of benefit was
small.[5] Inhibitors of programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are effective in
the treatment of squamous and nonsquamous
NSCLC.[6-11] To determine whether the addition of
the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda,
Merck) to platinum-based chemotherapy improves
outcomes in patients with squamous NSCLC of
any level of PD-L1 expression, we conducted the
global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3
KEYNOTE-407 trial, which compared pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and either
paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]–
paclitaxel [Abraxane, Celgene]) with placebo plus
chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel
or nab-paclitaxel).


Methods


**Patients**
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were
18 years of age or older, had pathologically confirmed stage IV squamous NSCLC (as classified
according to the seventh edition of the Cancer Stag_ing Manual of the American Joint Commission on_
Cancer[12]), had received no previous systemic
therapy for metastatic disease, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performancestatus score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with
higher scores indicating increasing disability; a
score of 0 indicates no symptoms, and 1 mild
symptoms),[13] had at least one measurable lesion
according to version 1.1 of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),[14] and
provided a tumor sample for the determination
of PD-L1 status. Patients were excluded if they
had symptomatic central nervous system metastases, had a history of noninfectious pneumonitis that required the use of glucocorticoids, had
active autoimmune disease, or were receiving
systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Full eli

gibility criteria are listed in the trial protocol, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.

**Trial Design and Treatments**
In this double-blind trial, randomization was
performed with the use of an interactive voiceresponse and integrated Web-response system.
Randomization was stratified according to PD-L1
tumor proportion score (≥1% vs. <1%; tumor proportion score is the percentage of tumor cells with
membranous PD-L1 staining, with <1% indicating
PD-L1–negative), choice of taxane (paclitaxel vs.
nab-paclitaxel), and geographic region of enrollment (East Asia vs. the rest of the world). Patients
were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive
200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo on
day 1 for up to 35 cycles. For the first 4 cycles,
all the patients also received carboplatin (at a dose
calculated to produce an area under the concentration–time curve of 6 mg per milliliter per minute) on day 1 and either paclitaxel (200 mg per
square meter of body-surface area) on day 1 or
nab-paclitaxel (100 mg per square meter) on days
1, 8, and 15. All treatments were administered
intravenously in 3-week cycles. The patients who
received paclitaxel also received premedication
with a glucocorticoid, a type 1 antihistamine, and
a type 2 antihistamine according to local guidelines; premedication with a glucocorticoid and
antihistamines was not required for patients who
received nab-paclitaxel.
The assigned treatment was continued until
radiographic disease progression, the occurrence
of unacceptable toxic effects, an investigator’s decision to discontinue the treatment, or withdrawal
of patient consent. If toxic effects were clearly attributed to one component of the treatment, that
component alone could be discontinued. Patients
who had radiographic disease progression but
were clinically stable could continue to receive
treatment at the discretion of an investigator until
disease progression was confirmed by imaging
performed at least 28 days after the imaging assessment that first showed disease progression.
The trial-group assignment could be unblinded for
a patient who had disease progression confirmed
by blinded, independent review of radiologic images at a central laboratory; such patients in the
placebo-combination group were eligible to cross
over to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy if all
protocol-specified criteria were met. Patients in
the pembrolizumab-combination group who were
deemed to have clinical benefit from treatment

despite radiographically confirmed disease progression were permitted to continue open-label
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Additional details
regarding treatment decisions, management of
adverse events, and eligibility criteria for crossover are available in the protocol.

**Assessments**
The PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent
Technologies) was used to assess PD-L1 expression
in formalin-fixed tumor samples obtained at the
time metastatic disease was diagnosed. PD-L1
expression was assessed during screening at a
central laboratory and was characterized according to the tumor proportion score.[15] Investigators
and patients were unaware of the tumor proportion score. Adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings were graded according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Tumor
imaging was scheduled for weeks 6, 12, and 18
and then every 9 weeks through week 45 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Response was assessed
according to RECIST, version 1.1.[14] Patients were
contacted to assess survival every 12 weeks during follow-up.

**Trial Oversight**
The trial was designed by a panel of academic advisors and employees of Merck Sharp & Dohme, the
sponsor of the trial. An external, independent
monitoring committee oversaw the trial and assessed efficacy and safety at prespecified interim
analyses. The trial protocol and all amendments
were approved by the appropriate ethics committee
at each participating center. All patients provided
written informed consent before enrollment.
The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the
trial to the protocol. The trial was conducted in
accordance with the provisions of the International
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the authors had access to the
data. Assistance in the preparation of the manuscript was provided by a medical writer employed
by the sponsor, and all the authors participated in
writing or reviewing and editing the manuscript.

**Statistical Analysis**
The trial had dual primary end points of overall
survival and progression-free survival, which was
assessed by means of blinded, independent central
review of radiologic images. The secondary end


points were response rate and duration of response, which were assessed by means of blinded,
independent central radiologic review, and safety.
The effects of PD-L1 expression on overall survival,
progression-free survival, and response rate were
prespecified exploratory end points. Efficacy was
assessed in the intention-to-treat population,
which included all patients who underwent randomization. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population, which included all patients who
underwent randomization and received at least
one dose of the assigned combination treatment.
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate overall survival, progression-free survival,
and duration of response. The stratified log-rank
test was used to assess between-group differences
in overall and progression-free survival. A stratified Cox proportional-hazards model and Efron’s
method of tie handling were used to assess the
magnitude of the difference between the trial
groups. There was no violation of the proportionalhazards model in the intention-to-treat population.
In some subgroups, there was a delayed separation of the survival curves, suggesting a possible
deviation from the proportional-hazards assumption. The stratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen was used to assess differences in response
rate. The randomization stratification factors were
applied to all stratified analyses.
The full statistical analysis plan is available
with the protocol. The graphical method of Maurer and Bretz was used to control the family-wise
type I error rate at a one-sided alpha level of
0.025 across all hypotheses and interim analyses
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available
at NEJM.org). We determined that with a sample
of 560 patients, the trial would have 90% power
to show a hazard ratio for disease progression or
death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha level of 0.01
(as calculated on the basis of 415 events of disease
progression or death) and 85% power to show a
hazard ratio for death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha
level of 0.01 (as calculated on the basis of 361
deaths) for the comparison between the pembrolizumab-combination group and the placebo-combination group.
The original protocol specified the performance
of two interim analyses and a final analysis
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). To
improve the ability of the trial to identify longterm treatment effects, the protocol was amended
to specify the performance of three interim analyses and a final analysis (Table S1 in the Supple

n engl j med nejm org 3

mentary Appendix). The second interim analysis
was to be performed after enrollment was complete and approximately 332 events of disease
progression or death had been observed; it was
estimated that approximately 212 deaths would
be observed at this time. As of April 3, 2018, there
were 349 events of disease progression or death
and 205 deaths, and the multiplicity-adjusted,
one-sided alpha spent at this interim analysis
(as determined on the basis of the Lan–DeMets
O’Brien–Fleming spending function) was 0.008 for
progression-free survival and 0.0029 for overall
survival. The external monitoring committee reviewed the results of the second interim analysis
on May 21, 2018. Because the committee reported
that the efficacy boundaries for the primary hypotheses of overall survival and progression-free
survival had been met, the decision was made to
report the results of the second interim analysis.
The trial is continuing in order to evaluate outcomes with additional follow-up.


Results


**Patients and Treatments**
A total of 779 patients from 137 sites in 17 countries were screened for randomization (Fig. S2 in
the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 561 patients
who met all eligibility criteria, 2 were excluded
from randomization because of a physician’s decision. Between August 19, 2016, and December 28,
2017, the remaining 559 patients from 125 sites
underwent randomization; 278 patients were assigned to the pembrolizumab-combination group
and 281 to the placebo-combination group. With
respect to the stratification factors, a PD-L1 tumor
proportion score of 1% or greater was observed
for 63.1% of patients, paclitaxel was the choice of
taxane for 60.1% of patients, and East Asia was
the region of enrollment for 19.0% of patients.
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics
were as expected for a trial involving patients with
metastatic, squamous NSCLC and were well balanced between groups (Table 1).
At least one dose of the assigned combination
treatment was received by all 278 patients in the
pembrolizumab-combination group and by 280 of
281 patients in the placebo-combination group.
The median duration of follow-up (defined as the
time from randomization to death or the date of
data cutoff for those who were alive) was 7.8
months (range, 0.1 to 19.1). The mean (±SD) dura

tion of treatment was 6.3±4.1 months in the
pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.7±3.5
months in the placebo-combination group. Four
doses of carboplatin were received by 78.8% of
the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination
group and by 73.2% of the patients in the placebocombination group (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Among the patients who received
paclitaxel, 78.7% in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 71.3% in the placebo-combination group received all 4 cycles; among the patients who received nab-paclitaxel, 22.9% in the
pembrolizumab-combination group and 21.2%
in the placebo-combination group received all
12 doses (66.1% and 64.6%, respectively, received
5 to 11 doses) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
As of April 3, 2018, a total of 121 patients
(43.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group
and 72 patients (25.7%) in the placebo-combination group were still receiving their assigned
treatment (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the pembrolizumab-combination group,
12 patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy
for a median of 3 cycles (range, 1 to 10) after disease progression was confirmed. In the placebocombination group, 75 patients crossed over to
receive pembrolizumab monotherapy in the trial
after the occurrence of disease progression, and
an additional 14 patients received a subsequent
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor outside the trial; thus, the
effective crossover rates (i.e., the rates among the
patients who crossed over in the trial and those
who received the same treatment or class of treatment outside the in-trial crossover) were 31.7%
among the 281 patients in the intention-to-treat
population and 42.8% among the 208 patients
who discontinued their assigned treatment for any
reason.

**Efficacy**
A total of 205 deaths occurred in the intentionto-treat population; the median overall survival
was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI],
13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to
14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard
ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001)
(Fig. 1A). Kaplan–Meier estimates of the rate of
survival at 1 year were 65.2% in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 48.3% in the
placebo-combination group. The benefit of adding

pembrolizumab was observed in all prespecified
subgroups (Fig. 1B), including in the subgroups
defined according to PD-L1 tumor proportion
score (estimated 1-year survival rate among patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of
<1% in the pembrolizumab-combination group vs.
the placebo-combination group, 64.2% vs. 43.3%

[hazard ratio for death, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.98];
among those with a score of 1 to 49%, 65.9% vs.
50.0% [hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.90];
and among those with a score of ≥50%, 63.4%
vs. 51.0% [hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.10])
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
A total of 349 events of disease progression
or death occurred in the intention-to-treat population, as assessed by means of blinded, independent central radiologic review; the median progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI,
6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination
group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the
placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to
0.70; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). The results were similar
when progression-free survival was assessed by
means of investigator review (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The progression-free survival benefit of the pembrolizumab combination
was observed in all prespecified subgroups
(Fig. 2B), with incremental improvements noted
with increasing PD-L1 tumor proportion score
(median progression-free survival among patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of
<1% in the pembrolizumab-combination group
vs. the placebo-combination group, 6.3 months vs.
5.3 months [hazard ratio for progression or death,
0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.98]; among those with a
score of 1 to 49%, 7.2 months vs. 5.2 months [hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.80]; and among
those with a score of ≥50%, 8.0 months vs. 4.2
months [hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.58])
(Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The response rate, as assessed by means of
blinded, independent central radiologic review,
was 57.9% (95% CI, 51.9 to 63.8) in the pembrolizumab-combination group and 38.4% (95% CI,
32.7 to 44.4) in the placebo-combination group.
The best overall response in each trial group is
summarized in Table S3 in the Supplementary
Appendix. The median time to response was 1.4
months in each group. The median duration of
response was 7.7 months (range, 1.1+ to 14.7+

**Safety**
Adverse events of any grade, regardless of attribution to a trial regimen by an investigator, occurred
in 98.2% of the patients in the pembrolizumabcombination group and in 97.9% of the patients
in the placebo-combination group (Table 2). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8%
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination
group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-combination group; led to dose reduction of
chemotherapy in 22.7% and 17.5%, respectively;
led to the discontinuation of any treatment component in 23.4% and 11.8%; and led to the discontinuation of all treatment components in 13.3%
and 6.4%. Adverse events led to death in 23 patients (8.3%) in the pembrolizumab-combination
group and in 18 patients (6.4%) in the placebocombination group. Summaries of adverse events
that occurred in the patients who received paclitaxel and in those who received nab-paclitaxel are
provided in Tables S5 and S6, respectively, in the
Supplementary Appendix.
The most common adverse events in both trial


groups were anemia, alopecia, and neutropenia
(Table 2). Among the adverse events that were
reported in at least 10% of patients, alopecia and
pruritus occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebocombination group, whereas back pain occurred
more frequently in the placebo-combination group;
after adjustment for exposure, rates of alopecia
and pruritus were similar in the groups (Fig. S7A
and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred
in at least 10% of patients were anemia and neutropenia (Table 2). Adverse events of grade 3 or
higher that occurred more frequently in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination group were pneumonitis and
autoimmune hepatitis (Fig. S7B in the Supplementary Appendix). Immune-mediated adverse
events and infusion reactions occurred in 28.8%
of patients in the pembrolizumab-combination
group and in 8.6% of patients in the placebocombination group (Table 3); the events were of
grade 3 or higher in 10.8% and 3.2%, respectively. One patient in each trial group died from
an immune-mediated adverse event (pneumonitis
in both).


The results of this phase 3 trial involving patients
with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC
showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to
standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and
either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, as compared
with chemotherapy alone, prolonged median overall survival by 4.6 months (15.9 months vs. 11.3
months) and median progression-free survival by
1.6 months (6.4 months vs. 4.8 months). The risk
of death was 36% lower and the risk of disease
progression or death was 44% lower in the
pembrolizumab-combination group than in the
placebo-combination group. The treatment effect
was similar among the patients who received paclitaxel and those who received nab-paclitaxel.
Prolongation of overall survival of a consistent
magnitude was observed across the categories of
PD-L1 tumor proportion score (<1%, 1 to 49%,
and ≥50%), although the upper limit of the 95%
confidence interval for the subgroup with a score
of 50% or greater exceeded 1. A higher response
rate and longer duration of response were also
observed.

- Listed are all adverse events that occurred during the trial period or within the 30 days thereafter (within 90 days for serious events), regardless of attribution to any trial regimen by an investigator. Adverse events that occurred during crossover from the placebo-combination
group to pembrolizumab monotherapy are excluded. The as-treated population included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned combination treatment.
† This category includes patients who discontinued pembrolizumab or placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel because of an adverse event at any time and patients who discontinued pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing four cycles of carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel.
‡ Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event.
§ The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were respiratory failure and sepsis in 3 patients each, cardiac
arrest and pulmonary hemorrhage in 2 patients each, and cardiac failure, circulatory collapse, hepatic failure, intestinal perforation, lung abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary sepsis in 1 patient each; 4 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death in the placebo-combination group were septic shock in 3 patients, cardiorespiratory arrest in
2 patients, and acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, hemothorax, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumonia, pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary mycosis, and sepsis in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause.

- In the pembrolizumab-combination group, the adverse events leading to death that were attributed to one or more components of the trail
regimen by an investigator were sepsis in 3 patients and hepatic failure, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure in 1 patient each; 2 of the deaths that were attributed to one or more components of the trail regimen in this group had an
unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death that were attributed to a component of the trail regimen in the placebo-combination
group were septic shock in 2 patients and acute kidney injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage in 1 patient each.

- The adverse events of interest are infusion reactions and events with an immune-related cause; they are considered regardless of whether the investigator attributed the event to a trial regimen or considered the event to be immune-related. The events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination group. In addition to the
specific preferred terms that are listed, related terms were also included. The as-treated population included all patients
who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned combination treatment.

In the phase 3 SQUIRE (Squamous NSCLC
treatment with the Inhibitor of EGF Receptor)
trial involving patients with untreated metastatic,
squamous NSCLC, the median overall survival was
1.6 months longer (11.5 months vs. 9.9 months)
and the risk of death 16% lower among patients
who received necitumumab plus gemcitabine and
cisplatin than among those who received gemcitabine and cisplatin alone.[5] The 11.3-month
median overall survival observed in the placebocombination group in the KEYNOTE-407 trial is
similar to the 11.5-month median overall survival observed in the group that received necitumumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin in the
SQUIRE trial,[5] a finding that further validates
the benefit of adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy.
The results of the current trial and of three
other phase 3 trials[8,10,11] suggest that pembrolizumab has a role in the first-line treatment of
metastatic NSCLC, regardless of histologic subtype or PD-L1 tumor proportion score. In patients
with PD-L1–negative tumors, pembrolizumab plus
chemotherapy has shown a high level of activity as
compared with chemotherapy alone. In patients


with PD-L1–positive tumors, the currently available data do not permit the determination of
whether pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy has
greater efficacy than pembrolizumab alone. Therefore, the treatment decision should be made on
an individual basis after a discussion of the relative risks and benefits and consideration of patient-specific factors.[16]

The findings with respect to other immune
checkpoint inhibitors in the first-line treatment
of metastatic NSCLC have been mixed. In a review of the literature, we found that, to date,
pembrolizumab has been the only PD-1 or PD-L1
inhibitor to show a significant survival benefit
over chemotherapy when given as monotherapy
or as part of combination therapy for metastatic,
squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC.[8,10,11,17-21] The
addition of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel did not
prolong overall survival, as compared with chemotherapy alone, among patients with advanced
squamous NSCLC.[18] Recently reported data from
the phase 3 IMpower131 trial showed that the
risk of disease progression or death among pa

tients with untreated metastatic, squamous
NSCLC was 29% lower with the addition of the
PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab to carboplatin and
nab-paclitaxel than with carboplatin and nabpaclitaxel alone; no effect on overall survival was
observed in this interim analysis.[19]

The PD-L1 tumor proportion score is an established biomarker for selecting patients with
metastatic NSCLC for first-line pembrolizumab
monotherapy on the basis of the clear relationship between higher PD-L1 expression in tumors
and increasing benefit of pembrolizumab.[8,10,22]
Although there was a relationship between greater PD-L1 expression and longer progression-free
survival in the KEYNOTE-407 trial and a relationship between greater PD-L1 expression and longer overall and progression-free survival in a
phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed
and a platinum-based drug for nonsquamous
NSCLC,[11] the clinical usefulness of PD-L1 as a biomarker in patients receiving combination therapy
may be less clear, given that the combination treatments improved outcomes over chemotherapy
across all categories of PD-L1 tumor proportion
scores. Other potential biomarkers for immune
checkpoint inhibition have been evaluated, including tumor mutational burden, which appears to be
complementary to and nonoverlapping with PD-L1
expression.[17,20,21] In the phase 3 CheckMate 227
trial, the risk of disease progression or death
among patients with previously untreated squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC with a high tumor
mutational burden was 42% lower with nivolumab
plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy.[20] An
exploratory analysis of data from patients with
PD-L1–negative tumors suggested that high tumor
mutational burden may predict a progressionfree survival benefit for nivolumab plus chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone.[21] Currently, the
ability of tumor mutational burden to predict an
overall survival benefit is uncertain.[17,20,21]

The adverse-event profile observed in the current trial was as expected on the basis of the
known events associated with pembrolizumab,
carboplatin, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, with
no new safety signals identified. Although the
rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events were generally low, more patients in
the pembrolizumab-combination group than in
the placebo-combination group discontinued the
regimen because of adverse events, probably in


part because of the longer duration of treatment
in this group.
A limitation of this trial is the short duration
of follow-up, which is a consequence of the second interim analysis being event-driven and not
time-driven. Given the stringency of the protocolspecified criteria for declaring statistical significance at the time of the second interim analysis,
the durability of the benefit of pembrolizumab,
and results observed with long-term follow-up in
other studies of pembrolizumab-based therapy
in patients with metastatic NSCLC,[8,23-25] we expect that the benefit observed in the pembrolizumab-combination group will be maintained or
even increase with longer follow-up. The short
follow-up also precludes the identification of longterm toxic effects, although, on the basis of studies of pembrolizumab monotherapy, long-term
toxic effects are not expected. This trial is being
continued to evaluate long-term efficacy and safety. Another limitation is the low percentage of
patients in the placebo-combination group who
received a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor after
treatment components were discontinued. Specific reasons for not receiving a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor were not collected and are not
clear. Possible reasons include death soon after
discontinuation or the decision to enter palliative
care. It is likely that the percentage of patients
who receive subsequent checkpoint inhibition will
increase with additional follow-up.
In conclusion, the addition of pembrolizumab
to standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and
either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel in patients with
previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC
resulted in significantly longer overall survival and
progression-free survival, a higher response rate,
and a longer duration of response than chemotherapy alone, regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression.
