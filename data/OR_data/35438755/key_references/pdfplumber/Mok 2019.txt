adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity occurred in
113 (18%) of 636 patients in the pembrolizumab group
and 252 (41%) of 615 patients in the chemotherapy
group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in
13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients in the pembrolizumab
and chemotherapy groups, respectively, and treatment
discontinuation in 57 (9%) and 58 (9%), respectively. The
most common treatment-related adverse event was
hypothyroidism (69 [11%] of 636) in the pembrolizumab
group and anaemia (229 [37%] of 615) in the chemo-
therapy group (table 2, appendix). Treatment-related
adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity that
occurred in 20 or more patients were pneumonitis in
the pembrolizumab group and anaemia, decreased
neutrophil count, neutropenia, decreased white blood cell
count, and decreased platelet count in the chemotherapy
group (table 2, appendix).
Adverse events of interest (events judged likely to be
immune mediated and infusion reactions) occurred in
177 (28%) of 636 patients (51 [8%] grade ≥3) in the
pembrolizumab group and 44 (7%) of 615 patients
(9 [1%] grade ≥3) in the chemotherapy group (table 3).
The only grade 3 or worse immune-mediated events that
occurred in five or more patients in the pembrolizumab
group were pneumonitis, severe skin reactions, and
hepatitis (table 3). One patient in the pembrolizumab
group died because of pneumonitis that occurred
concurrently with disease progression.
