Adverse events are reported in accordance with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities-preferred term. Grade 1–2 events occurring in ≥10% of patients in either
treatment group and grade 3 or worse events occurring in ≥2% of patients in either treatment group are shown. Events are listed in order of descending frequency in the total
population. Events are listed as indicated by the investigator on the case-report form; although some events (for example, fatigue and asthenia) might reflect the same
condition, they are listed separately if they were reported by the investigators as two distinct events. Adverse events are reported up to and including 90 days after last day of
dosing. Patients with multiple events in the same preferred term are counted only once for that preferred term. Patients with events in more than one preferred term are
counted once for each preferred term. A table showing all grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events is included in the appendix (pp 8–12). *One patient in the
tremelimumab arm died due to multiple grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, as well as multiple events that started more than 90 days after the last dose of
tremelimumab, including a grade 5 event of haemoptysis; thus, this patient is not included in the number of patients with grade 5 treatment-emergent adverse events.
