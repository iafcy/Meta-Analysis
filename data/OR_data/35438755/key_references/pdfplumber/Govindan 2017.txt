Results
Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy
(chemotherapy plusipilimumab, n= 388; chemotherapy plusplacebo, n= 361). MedianOS was
13.4monthsforchemotherapy plusipilimumab and12.4monthsforchemotherapy plusplacebo
(hazardratio,0.91;95%CI,0.77to1.07;P=.25).Medianprogression-freesurvivalwas5.6months
forbothgroups(hazardratio,0.87;95%CI,0.75to1.01).Ratesofgrade3or4treatment-related
adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were
numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than
with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related
deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus
placebo.
Conclusion
The addition of ipilimumab to first-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemo-
therapyaloneinpatientswithadvancedsquamousNSCLC.Thesafetyprofileofchemotherapyplus
ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies. Ongoing
studiesareevaluating ipilimumab incombination with nivolumabin thispopulation.
