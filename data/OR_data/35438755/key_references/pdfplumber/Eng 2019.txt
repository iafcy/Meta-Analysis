Between July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 484 patients were
screened, of whom 121 were excluded because they
did not meet inclusion criteria; 363 patients were
enrolled (figure 1). 183 patients were randomly assigned
to receive atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 90 to receive
atezolizumab monotherapy, and 90 to receive regorafenib.
349 patients received at least one dose of their assigned
treatment and were included in the safety population
(179 in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 90 in
the atezolizumab group, and 80 in the regorafenib group.
