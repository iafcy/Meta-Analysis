ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 From Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, Airway
(PD-1) that has antitumor activity in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Research Center North, German Center of
Lung Research, Grosshansdorf, Germany
with increased activity in tumors that express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).

* The as-treated population included all patients who received at least one dose of a trial treatment. For the patients in
the chemotherapy group who crossed over to the pembrolizumab group after disease progression, only events that oc-
curred during treatment with the assigned chemotherapy regimen are included.
† Events were attributed to treatment by the investigator and are listed as indicated by the investigator on the case-report
form. Although decreased neutrophil count and neutropenia may reflect the same condition, they were listed by the in-
vestigators as two distinct events; this is also the case for decreased platelet count and thrombocytopenia.
‡ Events are listed in descending order of frequency in the total population.
§ The immune-mediated events, both those that were and those that were not attributed to study treatment by the inves-
tigator, are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab group. In addition to specific preferred terms,
related terms are also included.
