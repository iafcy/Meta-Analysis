(PD-L1) were the primary end points. Safety was also evaluated.
RESULTS
At a median follow-up of 15 months, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly
longer recurrence-free survival than placebo in the overall intention-to-treat population
(1-year rate of recurrence-free survival, 75.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 71.3 to 78.9] vs.
61.0% [95% CI, 56.5 to 65.1]; hazard ratio for recurrence or death, 0.57; 98.4% CI, 0.43 to
0.74; P<0.001) and in the subgroup of 853 patients with PD-L1–positive tumors (1-year rate

62.6% [95% CI, 57.7 to 67.0] in the placebo group; hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.69;
P<0.001). Adverse events of grades 3 to 5 that were related to the trial regimen were reported
in 14.7% of the patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 3.4% of patients in the placebo
group. There was one treatment-related death due to myositis in the pembrolizumab group.
CONCLUSIONS
As adjuvant therapy for high-risk stage III melanoma, 200 mg of pembrolizumab ad-
ministered every 3 weeks for up to 1 year resulted in significantly longer recurrence-
free survival than placebo, with no new toxic effects identified. (Funded by Merck;

Figure 3. Forest Plot of Recurrence-free Survival According to Subgroup.
An unstratified univariate Cox model was used to estimate the hazard ratios for the risk of recurrence or death in the pembrolizumab
group as compared with the placebo group among all the patients. An unstratified Cox model including the trial group, a covariate of
interest (e.g., age 18 to <65 vs. ≥65 years) and the interaction term (e.g., age × treatment) was used to perform the interaction test and
estimate the hazard ratios for the subgroups. P values were yielded by the test of the treatment difference in the overall intention-to-
treat population or by the test of interaction; for each, the Wald test was used. The sizes of the blue boxes are nonlinearly proportional
to the numbers of events. The green diamond is centered on the overall hazard ratio (dashed line) and covers its 98.4% confidence in-
terval. In the subgroup analyses, 99% confidence intervals (blue lines) are presented. Data on lymph-node and ulceration status were

* The safety analysis included all patients who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of trial agent
(1011 patients). Listed are the adverse events that were reported between the first dose and 30 days after the last dose;
for all serious adverse events and serious immune-related adverse events, a time limit of 90 days after the last dose
was used. All adverse events correspond to part 1 of the trial (the 1-year adjuvant-therapy period) and not to part 2
(in which patients with disease recurrence were eligible to cross over or receive repeat treatment with pembrolizumab).
The severity of adverse events was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 4.0.
† The investigators determined whether adverse events were related to a trial agent. Adverse events and immune-related
adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of patients or those that were considered to be medically relevant are re-
ported. Patients may have had more than one event.
