35 cycles plus pemetrexed maintenance therapy. Crossover to pembrolizumab mono-
therapy was permitted among the patients in the placebo-combination group who
had verified disease progression. The primary end points were overall survival and
progression-free survival, as assessed by blinded, independent central radiologic review.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 10.5 months, the estimated rate of overall survival at
12 months was 69.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1 to 73.8) in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group versus 49.4% (95% CI, 42.1 to 56.2) in the placebo-
combination group (hazard ratio for death, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.64; P<0.001).
Improvement in overall survival was seen across all PD-L1 categories that were
evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 8.8 months (95% CI, 7.6 to 9.2) in
the pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.9 months (95% CI, 4.7 to 5.5) in the
placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.52;
95% CI, 0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 67.2%
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 65.8% of those in
the placebo-combination group.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC without
EGFR or ALK mutations, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy
of pemetrexed and a platinum-based drug resulted in significantly longer overall
survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by Merck;

nonsquamous tumor (1 patient in the pembrolizumab-combination group).
¶ The programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor proportion score was defined as the percentage of tumor cells with
membranous PD-L1 expression.
‖ PD-L1 expression could not be evaluated because specimens had an inadequate number of tumor cells or no tumor
cells. For stratification purposes, patients with PD-L1 expression that could not be evaluated were included in the sub-
group with a tumor proportion score of less than 1%; these patients were excluded from analyses of efficacy according
to the PD-L1 tumor proportion score.

* Listed are all adverse events that occurred during the trial period or within 30 days thereafter (within 90 days for serious events), regardless
of attribution to any trial treatment by the investigator. Adverse events that occurred during crossover from the placebo-combination group
to pembrolizumab monotherapy are excluded. The as-treated population included all the patients who had undergone randomization and
received at least one dose of the assigned combination therapy.
† This category includes patients who discontinued pemetrexed, a platinum-based drug, and pembrolizumab or placebo because of an ad-
verse event at any time and patients who discontinued pemetrexed and pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing
four cycles of a platinum-based drug.
‡ Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event.
§ The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were pneumonitis in 3 patients; intestinal ischemia in 2 pa-
tients; and acute kidney injury, acute kidney injury plus neutropenic sepsis, cardiac arrest, cardiac arrest plus respiratory failure, cardiac fail-
ure, cardiopulmonary failure, cerebral infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, encephalopathy, hemoptysis, ischemic stroke, lung
infection, mesenteric-artery embolism, myocardial infarction, neutropenic sepsis, peritonitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, pneumonia,
and septic shock in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death in the place-
bo-combination group were cerebral hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemoptysis, intracranial hemorrhage, hypokale-
mia plus supraventricular tachycardia, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonia plus respiratory failure, renal failure,
respiratory failure, and septic shock in 1 patient each; 1 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause.
