RESULTS
Of the 713 patients who underwent randomization, 709 received the assigned inter-
vention (473 patients received durvalumab and 236 received placebo). As of March 22,
2018, the median follow-up was 25.2 months. The 24-month overall survival rate was
66.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.7 to 70.4) in the durvalumab group, as com-
pared with 55.6% (95% CI, 48.9 to 61.8) in the placebo group (two-sided P = 0.005).
Durvalumab significantly prolonged overall survival, as compared with placebo
(stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.68; 99.73% CI, 0.47 to 0.997; P = 0.0025). Updated
analyses regarding progression-free survival were similar to those previously reported,
with a median duration of 17.2 months in the durvalumab group and 5.6 months in
the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.51;
95% CI, 0.41 to 0.63). The median time to death or distant metastasis was 28.3 months
in the durvalumab group and 16.2 months in the placebo group (stratified hazard
ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.68). A total of 30.5% of the patients in the durvalumab
group and 26.1% of those in the placebo group had grade 3 or 4 adverse events of

CONCLUSIONS
Durvalumab therapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than placebo.
No new safety signals were identified. (Funded by AstraZeneca; PACIFIC ClinicalTrials
