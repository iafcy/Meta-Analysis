RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who
were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 78.3%
in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38
to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembro-
lizumab–axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for
disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective re-
sponse rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group
and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of
pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal
Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and
poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or
higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembroli-
zumab–axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment
with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and
progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment
with sunitinib. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme; KEYNOTE-426 ClinicalTrials.gov

blinded, independent central review of radiologic imaging. Percentages may not total 100 because of rounding.
† The estimated treatment difference in objective response between the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and the sunitinib
group was 23.6 percentage points (95% CI, 17.2 to 29.9; P<0.001) and was calculated with the use of the method of
Miettinen and Nurminen and stratified according to IMDC risk group14 (favorable, intermediate, or poor) and geographic
region (North America, Western Europe, or the rest of the world).
‡ The patients who could not be evaluated included those who had one or more postbaseline imaging assessments,
none of which could be evaluated for response according to RECIST, version 1.1.
§ The patients who were not assessed included those who did not have any postbaseline imaging assessments.
¶ The median time to response was calculated only for patients who had a complete or partial response (256 patients in
the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 153 patients in the sunitinib group).
