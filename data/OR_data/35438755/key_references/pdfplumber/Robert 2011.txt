events and immune-related adverse events were prospectively defined: the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version
13.0, was used for the reporting of adverse events, and a list of events prespecified in the protocol was used to capture immune-related ad-
verse events, which were a subgroup of the reported adverse events. The categories are not mutually exclusive (i.e., one patient could have
