After a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combi-
nation group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination
group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall sur-
vival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median
progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-
combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination
group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70;
P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in
the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-
combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more
frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination
group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of
pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel
resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than che-
motherapy alone. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme; KEYNOTE-407 ClinicalTrials.gov

Figure 2. Progression-free Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of progression-free survival in the two trial groups (Panel A) and an analysis of
progression-free survival in key prespecified subgroups (Panel B). Progression-free survival was assessed according
to version 1.1 of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors by means of blinded, independent central radio-
logic review. Tick marks in Panel A indicate censoring of data at the last time the patient was known to be alive and
without disease progression (i.e., at the time of the last imaging assessment). In Panel B, progression-free survival
was analyzed in the overall population and in the subgroups defined according to the PD-L1 tumor proportion score
with the use of a Cox regression model that included trial group and the randomization stratification factors as co-
variates; progression-free survival was analyzed in all the other subgroups with the use of an unstratified Cox regres-
sion model that included trial group as a covariate.

less of attribution to any trial regimen by an investigator. Adverse events that occurred during crossover from the placebo-combination
group to pembrolizumab monotherapy are excluded. The as-treated population included all patients who underwent randomization and re-
ceived at least one dose of the assigned combination treatment.
† This category includes patients who discontinued pembrolizumab or placebo, carboplatin, and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel because of an ad-
verse event at any time and patients who discontinued pembrolizumab or placebo for an adverse event after completing four cycles of car-
boplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel.
‡ Patients could have discontinued one, two, or all agents for a given adverse event.
§ The adverse events leading to death in the pembrolizumab-combination group were respiratory failure and sepsis in 3 patients each, cardiac
arrest and pulmonary hemorrhage in 2 patients each, and cardiac failure, circulatory collapse, hepatic failure, intestinal perforation, lung ab-
scess, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary sepsis in 1 patient each; 4 of the deaths in this group had an unspeci-
fied cause. The adverse events leading to death in the placebo-combination group were septic shock in 3 patients, cardiorespiratory arrest in
2 patients, and acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, hemothorax, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pleural effusion, pneumonia, pneu-
monitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary mycosis, and sepsis in 1 patient each; 3 of the deaths in this group had an unspecified cause.
¶ In the pembrolizumab-combination group, the adverse events leading to death that were attributed to one or more components of the trail
regimen by an investigator were sepsis in 3 patients and hepatic failure, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and re-
spiratory failure in 1 patient each; 2 of the deaths that were attributed to one or more components of the trail regimen in this group had an
unspecified cause. The adverse events leading to death that were attributed to a component of the trail regimen in the placebo-combination
group were septic shock in 2 patients and acute kidney injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, and pulmonary hemor-
rhage in 1 patient each.
‖ Events are listed in descending order of frequency in the pembrolizumab-combination group. None of these events were of grade 5 severity.

specific preferred terms that are listed, related terms were also included. The as-treated population included all patients
who underwent randomization and received at least one dose of the assigned combination treatment.
