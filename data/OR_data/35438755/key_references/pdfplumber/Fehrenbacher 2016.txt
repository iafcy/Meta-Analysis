As with overall survival, progression-free survival and
objective response rate tended to show increased

(appendix). The greatest improvement was in the TC3 or
IC3 subgroup, with progression-free survival of
7·8 months with atezolizumab versus 3·9 months with
docetaxel (HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·31–1·16) and nine (38%) of
24 patients achieving an objective response with
atezolizumab versus three (13%) of 23 with docetaxel.
However, analysis of non-overlapping subgroups
suggested that, unlike overall survival, improved
progression-free survival and objective response rate with
atezolizumab were limited to only those patients with the
highest level of PD-L1 expression: the TC3 or IC3
subgroup (appendix). Objective response, as measured by

Atezolizumab was well tolerated with a safety profi le
consistent with previous studies,4 and we identifi ed no
new safety signals. The safety profi le was distinct from
that of docetaxel, with lower rates of drug discontinuations
due to adverse events, grade 3–4 adverse events, and
adverse events common to chemotherapy, including
nausea, cytopenias, and peripheral neuropathy; most
atezolizumab-associated toxicities were low grade.
Potential immune-mediated adverse events, such as
increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine
aminotransferase, pneumonitis, colitis, and hepatitis
occurred at low frequencies (<5%) in the atezolizumab
group and were generally manageable and reversible.
