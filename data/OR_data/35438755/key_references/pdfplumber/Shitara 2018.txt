Discussion
In this randomised, open­label, phase 3 study, pembroli­
zumab did not significantly improve overall survival
compared with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric
or gastro­oesophageal junction cancer with a PD­L1 CPS
of 1 or higher that progressed after one line of chemo­
therapy containing a platinum and fluoropyrimidine. The
overall survival curve for the pembrolizumab group
appeared to plateau at about 20 months, supporting a
