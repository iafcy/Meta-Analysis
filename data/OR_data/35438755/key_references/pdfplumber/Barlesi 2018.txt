Exploratory post-hoc analyses of the effect of treatment
with an immune checkpoint inhibitor after discon-
tinuation of study treatment on overall survival resulted in
an adjusted HR for avelumab versus docetaxel in an
inverse probability of censoring weighting model of the
PD-L1-positive population of 0·80 (95% CI 0·62–1·04). In
a naive sensitivity analysis in which patients were censored
at the date of subsequent anticancer therapy, the adjusted
HR was 0·86 (95% CI 0·68–1·09; appendix pp 11, 22).
Avelumab was associated with fewer treatment-related
adverse events than was docetaxel, and most adverse
events associated with avelumab were low grade (table 3).
Treatment-related adverse events of any grade occurred
in 251 (64%) of 393 avelumab-treated patients and
313 (86%) of 365 docetaxel-treated patients. The pro-
portion of patients with a grade 3 or worse (39 [10%] of
393 vs 180 [49%] of 365) or grade 4 or worse (eight [2%] vs
79 [22%]) treatment-related adverse event was lower in
the avelumab group than in the docetaxel group (appendix
pp 12–13). In the avelumab group, the most common
treatment-related adverse events of any grade were
infusion-related reaction (65 [17%] of 393) and decreased
appetite (34 [9%]; table 3, appendix pp 12–13), and the
most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse
events were infusion-related reaction (six [2%]) and
increased lipase (four [1%]; table 3, appendix pp 12–13). In
the docetaxel group, the most common treatment-related
adverse events of any grade were alopecia (97 [27%] of
365), anaemia (69 [19%]), and decreased appetite
(66 [18%]), and the most common grade 3 or worse
treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia
