Summary
Background Ipilimumab is an approved treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. We aimed to assess Lancet Oncol 2015
ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence. Published Online
April 1, 2015
Methods We did a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding lymph node http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/
