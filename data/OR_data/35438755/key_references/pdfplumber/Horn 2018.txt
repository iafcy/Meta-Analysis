investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-
to-treat population.
RESULTS
A total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202
patients to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median
overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in
the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54
to 0.91; P = 0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3
months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI,
0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02). The safety profile of atezolizumab plus carboplatin and
etoposide was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the indi-
vidual agents, with no new findings observed.
CONCLUSIONS
The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of exten-
sive-stage small-cell lung cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival
and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by F. Hoffmann–
La Roche/Genentech; IMpower133 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02763579.)

† The objective confirmed response rate was assessed in patients in the intention‑to‑treat population who had measur‑

mined by the investigator according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1.
‡ Duration of response was assessed in patients who had an objective confirmed response and was defined as the time
from the first occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of disease progression as determined by the
investigator (according to RECIST) or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.
