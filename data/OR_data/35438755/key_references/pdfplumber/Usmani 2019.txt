Summary
Background Lenalidomide and dexamethasone has been a standard of care in transplant-ineligible patients with newly Lancet Haematol 2019
diagnosed multiple myeloma. The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy. Published Online
KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab July 18, 2019
in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/
S2352-3026(19)30109-7
done to assess the benefit–risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Changes made to the trial protocol after the start of the
study are in appendix 1 (pp 6–14). On July 3, 2017, the
FDA halted this trial on the basis of interim data
presented to the data monitoring committee, which
showed an unfavourable benefit–risk profile of
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone.18
Based on that decision, all patients stopped study
treatment, completed the discontinuation visit, and
moved into the long-term safety and survival follow-up
period per protocol; a long-term survival analysis is
planned. Per the FDA decision, no long-term efficacy
data will be collected. Quality-of-life assessments will not
be reported because of early trial termination. Subsequent
treatment decisions were made by the physicians per
standard of care; data will not be collected.
At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), median follow-up was
6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6). Baseline characteristics were
mostly similar between the groups, except high-risk
cytogenetics (24 [16%] of 151 in the pembrolizumab plus
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group vs ten [7%] of
150 in the lena lidomide and dexamethasone group),
anaemia (84 [56%] vs 68 of [45%]), and renal impairment
(21 [14%] vs 12 [8%]; table 1).
The primary endpoint of median progression-free
survival was not reached in either group; 24 (16%)
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and
