Statement of Translational Relevance
Overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced gastric cancer is 8 to 14 months in the first-
line setting and 4 to 5 months in the second-line setting. Ipilimumab, a fully human anti-
CTLA4 IgG1 antibody, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor with antitumor activity in solid
tumors. Here, ipilimumab monotherapy was compared with the current best standard of care
(including continuation of first-line fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy) in a phase 2 proof-of-
concept study designed to investigate safety and efficacy in patients with gastric and
gastroesophageal junction cancer. At final analysis, immune-related progression-free survival
was similar between arms, as was median OS of 1 year. Ipilimumab-related adverse events
were manageable, and no new safety signals were identified. Based on the safety profile
observed in this study and preliminary results from the combination of ipilimumab 3 mg/kg with
nivolumab 1 mg/kg—which showed an encouraging median OS of 6.9 months and a 12-month
OS rate of 34% in chemotherapy-refractory patients with gastroesophageal cancer (25) — these
data support the investigation of ipilimumab in combination with other therapies in gastric
cancer.

Abstract
Purpose: Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated
protein-4 interactions, enhances T-cell activation and promotes tumor immunity. This phase 2
study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy vs best supportive care
among patients with advanced/metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer who
achieved at least stable disease with first-line chemotherapy.
Experimental Design: Eligible patients were randomized to ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3
weeks for four doses, then 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for up to 3 years, or BSC, which could
include continuation of fluoropyrimidine until progression or toxicity. The primary endpoint was
immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS); secondary endpoints included PFS by
modified WHO criteria and overall survival (OS).
Results: Of 143 patients screened, 57 were randomized to each arm. irPFS with ipilimumab vs
BSC was not improved (2.92 months [95% CI, 1.61–5.16] vs 4.90 months [95% CI, 3.45–6.54],
HR=1.44; 80% CI, 1.09–1.91; P=0.097), resulting in study cessation. At study closeout, which
occurred 8 months after the interim analysis, the median OS durations were 12.7 months (95%
CI, 10.5–18.9) and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3–not estimable), respectively. Grade 3/4 treatment-
related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 23% of ipilimumab-treated patients, of which
diarrhea (9%) and fatigue (5%) were most frequent, and in 9% of active BSC-treated patients.
Conclusions: While ipilimumab at 10 mg/kg was manageable it did not improve irPFS vs BSC.
However, comparable median OS of 1 year and a favorable safety profile support the
investigation of ipilimumab in combination with other therapies for advanced gastric cancer.

Introduction
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer globally and represents the third most
common cause of cancer-related deaths (1). While the introduction of nationwide screening
programs has improved the detection of gastric cancer in some countries, particularly in Korea
and Japan, many cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage globally (2). Although several
therapies are used in the first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer, there is no universally
preferred treatment or maintenance regimen, and the prognosis for these patients remains poor.
In phase 3 clinical trials of patients with advanced gastric cancer, the median overall survival
(OS) in patients treated in the first-line setting was approximately 8 to 14 months (3-10). Median
OS in the second-line setting is reported to range between 4.0 to 9.6 months compared with 2.4
to 4.3 months with current best supportive care (BSC) (11-14).
Ipilimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody (IgG1) that blocks cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte–associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), an immune checkpoint protein that negatively
regulates T-cell effector responses. By blocking the interaction between CTLA-4 and its ligands,
ipilimumab promotes antitumor responses through T-cell activation and tumor infiltration
(15,16). Ipilimumab has demonstrated clinical efficacy in metastatic melanoma with a significant
OS benefit in two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials (17,18), as well as in a number of other tumor
types (19-22). This study evaluated the efficacy of ipilimumab monotherapy vs BSC as
maintenance therapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced/metastatic gastric or
gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer who achieved at least stable disease (SD) following first-
line treatment with combination platinum-fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy. Importantly, BSC

could include continuation of first-line fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy as maintenance (active
BSC) or no active maintenance treatment. The results of the analysis described herein are based
on a preplanned interim analysis (database lock in June 2014), which became the final analysis
upon trial cessation. The study closed 8 months later, and updated OS results from that analysis
are reported herein.
Materials and Methods
Patients
In this randomized, phase 2, open-label study (NCT01585987), patients with
histologically confirmed, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ
adenocarcinoma were eligible if they were ≥18 years of age, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 or 1, had a life expectancy of >12 weeks, and had received a
platinum and fluoropyrimidine based chemotherapy regimen as lead-in chemotherapy in the
first-line setting consisting of either oxaliplatin + 5-fluorouracil every 14 days; oxaliplatin +
capecitabine every 21 days; cisplatin + capecitabine every 21 days; cisplatin + 5-fluorouracil
every 21 days; or cisplatin + S1 every 5 weeks. Eligible patients needed to have radiological
evidence of clinical benefit (either complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable
disease [SD]) by modified World Health Organization (mWHO) criteria (Supplementary Table
S1) following the last dose of first-line chemotherapy and were required to have at least one
measurable lesion (except for those patients who had a CR); previous irradiation of the
measurable lesion was not allowed. Toxicities related to prior cancer therapy (chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, or surgery) must have returned to grade 1 or baseline. Patients were excluded if

they had known human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–positive status or radiological
evidence of brain metastasis, documented history of severe autoimmune disease or immune-
mediated symptomatic disease requiring prolonged systemic immunosuppressive treatment for
>2 months, or a history of HIV infection or active hepatitis B or C infection.
The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines.
Institutional review board/independent ethics committee approval of the protocol was obtained
before initiating the trial. All participating patients (or their legal representatives) gave written
informed consent.
Treatment and Monitoring
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either intravenous ipilimumab 10 mg/kg,
every 3 weeks for four doses during the induction phase and then 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks for
up to 3 years during the maintenance phase, or BSC. BSC could have included the same
fluoropyrimidine the patient received during first-line chemotherapy as maintenance but no other
systemic anticancer therapy. Randomization was stratified by (1) geographic region (Asia vs rest
of the world) and (2) prior best response to first-line chemotherapy (CR/PR vs SD by mWHO
criteria). Treatment was to be given until confirmed immune-related progressive disease or
unacceptable toxicity, or for up to 3 years from the first dose of ipilimumab or withdrawal of
consent. Crossover between treatment arms was not allowed.
The primary endpoint of the study was immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS)
per assessment of a blinded independent review committee. Secondary endpoints were

progression-free survival (PFS) by mWHO criteria, OS, and immune-related best overall
response rate (irBORR), and exploratory endpoints included the safety profile of patients in each
treatment arm, duration of response, and immune-related time to progression. Safety analysis
was performed in all treated patients using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.
Tumor assessments were performed at screening and every 6 weeks ± 1 week starting
from randomization until documented and confirmed disease progression per immune-related
response criteria and subsequent systemic therapy. Any patient who developed an objective
tumor response or disease progression by immune-related response criteria was required to
undergo confirmatory scans within 4 weeks of the prior scan to verify the radiological finding.
Statistical Analysis
Efficacy endpoints were analyzed on an intent-to-treat basis. The study was powered for
the primary endpoint, irPFS. Using the assumption that the irPFS of each arm follows an
exponential distribution and the true hazard ratio (HR) for irPFS was 0.64 between the
ipilimumab vs BSC arm, 91 irPFS events were required for a two-sided stratified log-rank test
with α = 0.2 to have 80% power. The study was not powered for an analysis of differences in
OS.
The distributions of irPFS, PFS per mWHO, and OS were compared between treatment
arms using a two-sided log-rank test stratified by geographic region and prior response to first-
line chemotherapy. irPFS, PFS per mWHO, and OS for each treatment arm were estimated and
plotted using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The estimates of medians and two-sided

95% CIs were calculated by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Exact two-sided 95% CIs for
irBORR rates were computed using the method of Clopper and Pearson. For the comparison of
irBORR between treatment arms, a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test with an associated odds ratio
estimate and exact 80% CI, stratified by randomization stratification factors, was used. For
duration of response and time to progression, the event-free probabilities for each treatment arm
were estimated and plotted using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. The estimates of
medians and two-sided 95% CIs were calculated by the Brookmeyer and Crowley method.
Results
Patients
Between July 2012 and July 2014, a total of 143 patients with gastric or GEJ cancer from
12 countries across Asia, Europe, and North America who did not show evidence of disease
progression following completion of initial fluoropyrimidine/platinum doublet first-line
chemotherapy were screened for eligibility. Of these patients, 114 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio
to receive ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or BSC (Fig. 1). Baseline patient disposition and disease
characteristics were generally balanced across treatment arms (Table 1). At baseline, 83% of
patients had gastric cancer and 17% had GEJ cancer. In both treatment arms, 88% of patients had
metastatic cancer and 12% had locally advanced cancer.
The median number of doses received by patients in the ipilimumab arm was four (range,
1–10) (Supplementary Table S2). Fifty-eight percent of patients treated with ipilimumab
received four or more ipilimumab doses, and the median time on study treatment was 9 weeks.
Most patients in the BSC arm received active treatment (45/57; 79%), which included

capecitabine (n=26), 5-fluorouracil (n=15), and S-1 (n=4); the median time on study treatment
for patients receiving active treatment was 12 weeks. At the time of the final analysis, 3 patients
(5.3%) in the ipilimumab arm and 4 patients (7.8%) in the BSC arm were still on treatment; by
study closeout all of these patients had discontinued (Fig. 1). The primary reason for
discontinuation in both study arms was disease progression. Nine patients (15.8%) in the
ipilimumab arm discontinued due to study drug toxicity. Among those receiving active BSC, 4
patients (7.8%) discontinued due to study drug toxicity. One death (aspiration pneumonia, which
resulted from accidental choking) was reported as a reason for discontinuation in the ipilimumab,
and was determined to be unrelated to study treatment. Forty-one (72%) patients in the
ipilimumab arm and 36 (63%) patients in the BSC arm went on to receive subsequent therapy
(Supplementary Table S3).
Clinical Outcomes
The median irPFS was 2.92 months (95% CI, 1.61–5.16) in the ipilimumab arm and 4.90
months (95% CI, 3.45–6.54) in the BSC arm (Fig. 2). The study did not demonstrate irPFS
improvement with ipilimumab vs BSC (HR, 1.44; 80% CI, 1.09–1.91; P=0.097). The irPFS rates
in the ipilimumab 10 mg/kg and BSC arms were 22.3% vs 38.5% at 6 months and 10.6% vs
9.3% at 12 months, respectively. PFS findings (per mWHO criteria) were consistent with irPFS:
improvement with ipilimumab vs BSC (HR, 1.59; 80% CI, 1.20–2.10; P=0.034) was not
observed (Supplementary Fig. S1). Median PFS in the ipilimumab and BSC arms was 2.72
months and 4.90 months, respectively. The PFS rates (per mWHO) in the ipilimumab and BSC
arms were 18.3% vs 38.5% at 6 months and 8.4% vs 16.1% at 12 months, respectively. For both

irPFS and PFS in the initial 6 weeks, progression was more frequent in the ipilimumab arm
relative to the BSC arm; however, after 6 weeks, the rate of progression appeared similar among
the two study arms (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1).
At study closeout, which occurred 8 months after the interim analysis, there were 36
deaths in the ipilimumab arm and 30 deaths in the BSC arm; the median OS durations were 12.7
months (95% CI, 10.5–18.9) and 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.3–not estimable), respectively (Fig. 3).
Subgroup analyses of OS by the baseline demographics and disease characteristics are shown in
Supplementary Fig S2.
The irBORR was 1.8% (n=1/57) in the ipilimumab arm and 7.0% (n=4/57) in the BSC
arm (Table 2). SD was the best overall response for 31.6% (n=18/57) and 40.4% (n=23/57) of
patients in the ipilimumab and BSC arms, respectively. The median duration of response was not
estimable for either study arm.
Safety
A total of 41 patients (71.9%) who received ipilimumab had at least one treatment-related
adverse event (TRAE) and 13 (22.8%) of these patients experienced at least one grade 3/4 TRAE
(Table 3). The most frequent TRAEs of any grade (reported in at least 10% of patients) in the
ipilimumab arm were pruritus (31.6%), diarrhea (24.6%), fatigue (22.8%), and rash (17.5%). The
most frequent grade 3/4 TRAEs (reported in at least 5% patients) in the ipilimumab arm were
fatigue (8.8%) and rash (5.3%). Among patients who received active BSC therapy, the most
frequent TRAEs of any grade were asthenia (17.8%) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia
(15.6%); the latter was the most common grade 3/4 TRAE (4.4%). The most common treatment-

related serious adverse events (SAEs) reported for patients in the ipilimumab treatment arm were
diarrhea (12.3%) and colitis (5.3%). No treatment-related SAEs were reported for patients
receiving BSC. On-study TRAEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug were reported in 10
patients (17.5%) receiving ipilimumab and in 4 (8.9%) receiving active BSC; ipilimumab-related
adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug were gastrointestinal disorders (n=6),
asthenia (n=2), fatigue (n=1), and acute hepatitis (n=1). In both the ipilimumab and BSC arms,
there were no deaths considered related to study therapy.
Discussion
This report represents the first investigation of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg in patients with
gastric or GEJ cancer and the first randomized clinical trial of an immune checkpoint inhibitor in
this patient population. More than half (57.9%) of ipilimumab-treated patients received at least
four ipilimumab induction doses, and nearly one-fifth (19.3%) of the patients received
ipilimumab maintenance dosing. Exposure to ipilimumab in this study was similar to that
observed in other studies evaluating the 10 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab. TRAEs in the ipilimumab
arm were reported at a rate consistent with those reported for other ipilimumab-treated patient
populations, and no new safety signals were identified. This important observation supports the
continuing investigation of ipilimumab in gastric cancer in combination with other
immunotherapies, given that the known safety profile of ipilimumab includes gastrointestinal
adverse events (23). The observed rate of grade 3/4 diarrhea (<10%) was considered acceptable
for a 10 mg/kg dose of ipilimumab. No episodes of gastrointestinal perforations or hepatotoxicity
were reported.

Ipilimumab did not improve irPFS or PFS defined by mWHO criteria compared with
BSC. In the ipilimumab arm, the rate of progression was higher in the first 6 weeks relative to
the BSC arm, but then converged thereafter such that the rates of progression were similar
among both arms. One possible explanation for this observation is that the first-line active
chemotherapy was controlling the disease in some patients (in both arms) at study entry, and
removal of the active chemotherapy (in the ipilimumab arm) may have enabled disease
progression to recommence. Importantly, immunotherapies such as ipilimumab are known to
have a delayed onset of effect (24,25). Based on PFS/irPFS results, there is limited clinical
activity of single agent ipilimumab as sequential or maintenance therapy for this aggressive
disease and combination therapies with either multiple checkpoint inhibitors or standard of care
therapies may be needed. Combination therapy using multiple checkpoint inhibitors is showing
promising results in other patient populations.
Information on long-term survival among patients is limited. Nevertheless, some patients
who received active treatment were followed for as long as 2 years; this included 3 patients
treated with ipilimumab who were alive at 2 years. This suggests that ipilimumab may show
activity and affect long-term survival in a subset of patients.
While preliminary biomarker analyses such as serum soluble factors, blood candidate
gene expression, peripheral blood mononuclear cell T-cell subsets and Tregs, were performed,
limited tumor tissue was available for analyses because collection was not required at study
initiation. Our analyses were consistent with previous observations that ipilimumab treatment
increased levels of circulating activated CD4+ T cells. Changes in other blood based biomarkers

were modest and no robust association was observed between biomarkers and treatment.
Although the study did not achieve its primary endpoint, the safety profile of ipilimumab
in this patient population established a foundation for potential future use in combination
therapy. Given that the median OS in both treatment arms was approximately 1 year and the
safety profile of ipilimumab was consistent with that seen in other patient populations,
combination therapy (ipilimumab plus a second immunotherapy or ipilimumab plus
chemotherapy) may be a viable approach to treating patients with advanced/metastatic gastric or
GEJ cancer. In subgroup analyses of OS according to the baseline demographics and disease
characteristics (Supplementary Fig S2), it is important to note that outcomes by race and region
were similar. Ipilimumab is currently being investigated in combination with nivolumab in a
phase 1/2 trial of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancer refractory to ≥ 1 prior
chemotherapies for the treatment of metastatic or locally advanced disease (26). Preliminary
results of this ongoing trial reported an ORR of 26% (12 of 46 patients) with the combination of
nivolumab 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab 3 mg/kg. At this interim analysis, a median OS of 6.9
months and a 12-month OS rate of 34% were observed. The safety profile was consistent with
those previously reported. These results suggest that nivolumab and ipilimumab might act in a
synergistic manner and further support the clinical development of checkpoint inhibitors in the
treatment of gastric cancer.
