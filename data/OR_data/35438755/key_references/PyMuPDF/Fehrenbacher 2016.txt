Background Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, 
including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells, or both. 
We assessed eﬃ  cacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 
expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population. 
Methods In this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum 
chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in 
Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, 
measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate 
haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratiﬁ ed by PD-L1 tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cell status, 
histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block 
size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 
75 mg/m² once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as 
percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and 
tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and 
IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 
173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least 
one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.
Findings Patients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the 
atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received 
docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12·6 months (95% CI 9·7–16·4) for atezolizumab versus 
9·7 months (8·6–12·0) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·53–0·99]; p=0·04). Increasing improvement in 
overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0·49 [0·22–1·07; p=0·068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 
HR 0·54 [0·33–0·89; p=0·014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0·59 [0·40–0·85; p=0·005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1·04 [0·62–1·75; 
p=0·871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, deﬁ ned by high T-eﬀ ector–interferon-γ-associated 
gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued 
because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group 
versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3–4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the 
atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event.
Interpretation Atezolizumab signiﬁ cantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously 
treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and 
tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab beneﬁ t. 
Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety proﬁ le distinct from chemotherapy.

Introduction
Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, 
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC); 
systemic 
chemotherapy 
(eg, 
docetaxel) 
provides only modest beneﬁ ts.1 Programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune-checkpoint protein 
expressed on tumour cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating 
immune cells that downregulates antitumoural T-cell 
function through binding to programmed death 1 (PD-1) 
and B7.1 (also known as CD80) receptors.2,3 The 
engineered, humanised IgG1 monoclonal anti-PD-L1 
antibody atezolizumab (MPDL3280A; F Hoﬀ mann-La 
Roche/Genentech) blocks PD-L1–PD-1 and PD-L1–B7.1 
interactions, resulting in restoration of antitumour T-cell 
activity and enhanced T-cell priming.4–6 Clinical

pembrolizumab) have established the therapeutic value 
of targeting the PD-L1–PD-1 pathway.7–10 Blocking PD-L1–
B7.1 binding on T cells and antigen-presenting cells 
might additionally inhibit downregulation of immune 
responses, thus preventing inhibition of T-cell activation 
and cytokine production.11,12 Direct targeting of PD-L1 
leaves the PD-L2–PD-1 interaction intact, potentially 
avoiding 
eﬀ ects 
on 
immune 
homoeostasis.6,13–16 
Atezolizumab is engineered to eliminate binding to 
Fc  receptors and prevent Fc-eﬀ ector function. This 
modiﬁ cation 
eliminates 
antibody-dependent 
cell-
mediated cytotoxicity and thus avoids potential loss of 
PD-L1-expressing T-eﬀ ector cells and reduced anticancer 
immunity. Early-phase clinical trials of atezolizumab 
monotherapy have shown durable antitumour responses 
in NSCLC,4,17,18 associated with tumour cell and tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cell PD-L1 expression when 
assessed with immunohistochemistry.17,18 These studies 
suggest that the beneﬁ t of atezolizumab is pronounced 
in tumours with pre-existing immunity.4 However, these 
biomarker hypotheses have not been tested in a 
randomised clinical trial.
Accordingly, we designed POPLAR to investigate the 
eﬃ  cacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in 
second-line and third-line NSCLC, and to further assess 
the predictive value of PD-L1 expression levels on tumour 
cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells.
Methods
Study design
POPLAR is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, all-
comer phase 2 trial, done at 61 academic medical centres 
and community oncology practices across 13 countries 
in Europe and North America. The study was done in 
full accordance with the guidelines for Good Clinical 
Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Protocol (and 
modiﬁ cation) 
approval 
was 
obtained 
from 
an 
independent ethics committee for each site (listed in 
appendix).
Patients
We enrolled 287 patients. Eligible patients were aged 
18 years or older, had Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by 
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 
(RECIST v1.1), adequate haematological and end-organ 
function, and provided tumour specimens for central 
PD-L1 testing on formalin-ﬁ xed paraﬃ  n-embedded 
sections before enrolment. Key exclusion criteria were 
active or untreated CNS metastases, history of 
pneumonitis, autoimmune or chronic viral diseases, or 
previous treatment with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-
CTLA4, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-1 therapeutic antibodies, 
or PD-L1–PD-1 pathway-targeting agents. Patients gave 
written informed consent.
Research in context 
Evidence before this study
Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, 
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 
systemic chemotherapy provides only modest beneﬁ t. Cancer 
immunotherapy is an exciting new treatment option. We 
searched PubMed from Dec 18, 2010, to Dec 18, 2015, for clinical 
trials with the terms “non-small cell lung cancer”, 
“programmed-death ligand 1”, “PD-L1”, “programmed-death 1”, 
“PD-1”, and “cancer immunotherapy”, selecting relevant English 
language publications within the past 5 years. We identiﬁ ed 
seven studies (phases 1–3, all of which were international and 
open-label) of atezolizumab, pembrolizumab, or nivolumab. 
Studies indicated the therapeutic value of targeting the 
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–programmed death 1 (PD-
1) pathway to treat NSCLC, and that atezolizumab shows durable 
responses as monotherapy for this disease. These responses were 
associated with tumour cell and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cell 
PD-L1 expression, and the beneﬁ t was more pronounced in 
tumours with pre-existing immunity. However, these biomarker 
hypotheses had not been tested in an atezolizumab randomised 
clinical trial. 
Added value of this study 
POPLAR is the ﬁ rst study of a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor in a 
randomised clinical trial of patients with previously treated 
NSCLC. In our study, atezolizumab showed a signiﬁ cant 
improvement in overall survival compared with docetaxel in 
patients with advanced, previously treated NSCLC. We saw 
increasing improvement in overall survival with increasing PD-L1 
expression in the atezolizumab group, whereas patients with the 
lowest PD-L1 expression assigned to atezolizumab experienced 
similar overall survival to those assigned to docetaxel. We also 
showed that PD-L1 expression on both tumour cells and 
tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells is independently predictive of 
survival improvement with atezolizumab. 
Implications of all the available evidence
Targeting the PD-L1–PD-1 pathway improves outcomes for 
patients with NSCLC.  Together with reports of the anti-PD1 
antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab, our results aﬃ  rm that 
not only the receptor, but also the ligand components of the 
PD-L1–PD-1 axis are valid targets for the treatment of lung cancer. 
The predictive value of PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and 
tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells (rather than tumour cells alone) 
suggests that an immunohistochemistry test for PD-L1 expression 
on both cell types would identify a broader patient population 
likely to beneﬁ t from atezolizumab treatment than that identiﬁ ed 
by testing tumour cells alone. Additionally, the predictive value of 
the T-eﬀ ector and interferon-γ gene signature for improvement in 
overall survival might provide insights into the biology of 
atezolizumab eﬃ  cacy and aid development of the next generation 
of diagnostic assays for therapies targeting this pathway.

Randomisation and masking
Patients were stratiﬁ ed by tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cell 
PD-L1 expression, previous lines of chemotherapy (one vs 
two), and histology (non-squamous vs squamous), then 
permuted block-randomised (1:1) with a block size of four 
to receive either atezolizumab or docetaxel using an 
interactive voice or web response system (Bracket, 
San Francisco, CA, USA). The sequence was generated by 
Bracket; Bracket did not have any involvement in the rest of 
the trial. The trial centres enrolled the patients. The study 
was open-label, and allocation was unmasked. 
Procedures
Patients received intravenous atezolizumab (1200 mg 
ﬁ xed dose) or docetaxel (75 mg/m²) every 3 weeks on day 1 
of each 3-week cycle. Atezolizumab was continued as long 
as patients received clinical beneﬁ t according to 
investigator assessment (absence of unacceptable toxicity 
or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease 
progression after an integrated assessment of radiographic 
data, biopsy results [if available], and clinical status), and 
patients consented to continuation. Docetaxel was given 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. No 
docetaxel-to-atezolizumab crossover was allowed.
We assessed tumours by imaging at baseline, every 
6 weeks for 36 weeks after randomisation, and every 
9 weeks (range 8–10 weeks) thereafter. Tumour 
assessments continued until progression, irrespective of 
treatment discontinuation. For patients in the atezolizumab 
group who continued beyond progression, assessments 
continued until discontinuation. 
We assessed PD-L1 expression prospectively on tumour 
cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells with the 
VENTANA SP142 PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay 
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). We scored 
tumour cells expressing PD-L1 as a percentage of total 
tumour cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells 
expressing PD-L1 as a percentage of tumour area, as 
previously described (tumour cells scored as percentage of 
PD-L1-expressing tumour cells: TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and 
<50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%; tumour-
inﬂ itrating immune cells scored as percentage of tumor 
area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and 
IC0<1%; ﬁ gure 1).4 Scoring was highly reproducible 
among pathologists and clinical testing sites.19 We 
analysed immune gene expression in pretreatment 
tumour specimens using a previously described Fluidigm-
based gene-expression platform (Fluidigm; South San 
Francisco, CA, USA).4 The T-eﬀ ector and interferon-γ 
gene signature was deﬁ ned by CD8A, GZMA, GZMB, 
IFNγ, EOMES, CXCL9, CXCL10, and TBX21. All of these 
genes had high co-expression in POPLAR tumour 
specimens (appendix). These genes have previously been 
associated with activated T cells, immune cytolytic activity, 
and interferon-γ expression.20–23 We also analysed by 
PD-L1, PD-1, PD-L2, and B7.1 gene expression. We deﬁ ned 
the high biomarker group as gene expression at or above 
the median level, and the low biomarker group as gene 
expression below the median level. We collected serum 
and tumour samples for pharmacokinetic, immuno-
genicity, and biomarker analyses.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was overall survival (time from 
randomisation to death) in the intention-to-treat 
population and PD-L1 subgroups, using a hierarchical 
procedure, and was centrally assessed. Secondary 
endpoints 
included 
investigator-assessed 
objective 
response rate (per RECIST v1.1), investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival (time from randomisation to 
the ﬁ rst occurrence of RECIST v1.1-deﬁ ned disease 
progression, or death from any cause), and investigator-
assessed duration of response (time from ﬁ rst occurrence 
of objective response to time of RECIST v1.1-deﬁ ned 
disease progression, or death from any cause, whichever 
came ﬁ rst).
Additionally, we assessed eﬃ  cacy according to immune-
modiﬁ ed RECIST criteria,17 which were designed to 
characterise unconventional response patterns associated 
with cancer immunotherapy, as a secondary endpoint. 
Other secondary endpoints were atezolizumab pharma-
cokinetics, patient-reported outcomes, bio markers, and 
pharmacodynamics.
We graded adverse events with the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events version 4.0.24 Laboratory safety assessments 
included monitoring haematology and blood chemistry.
Statistical analysis
We did three interim overall survival analyses to monitor 
the eﬃ  cacy and safety proﬁ le of atezolizumab. We used a 
small α of 0·0001, 0·0001, and 0·001 for the ﬁ rst, second,

and third planned interim analyses of overall survival, 
respectively. We did the ﬁ nal overall survival analysis 
when 173 deaths had occurred in the intention-to-treat 
population, using a two-sided α level of 4·88%. We 
calculated that the analysis on the intention-to-treat 
population had 82·3% power, with a two-sided α level of 
5%, assuming about 180 deaths, with a HR of 0·65 
(assuming event times are exponentially distributed, 
median overall survival in the control group would 
be 8 months, and patients would be enrolled 
over 8 months). Assuming target HRs of 0·35 for 
TC3 or IC3, 0·5 for TC2/3 or IC2/3, and 0·6 for 
TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, PD-L1 expression subgroup 
analyses of overall survival had 80% power.
We compared treatment groups for overall survival and 
progression-free survival individually using a stratiﬁ ed 
log-rank test in the intention-to-treat population 
(stratiﬁ ed by histology, number of previous chemotherapy 
regimens, and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cell PD-L1 
level). We used an unstratiﬁ ed log-rank test in PD-L1 
immuno histochemistry subgroups because of the small 
sample sizes. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to 
estimate median overall survival and progression-free 
survival and to draw survival curves, and the Brookmeyer-
Crowley method for 95% CIs. We used stratiﬁ ed Cox-
regression models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs in the 
intention-to-treat 
population 
(using 
the 
same 
stratiﬁ cation variables as in the log-rank test). We used 
unstratiﬁ ed 
Cox 
regression 
models 
for 
PD-L1 
immunohistochemistry 
subgroup 
populations. 
We 
adjusted gene expression subgroup analyses for smoking 
status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status, and sex, and stratiﬁ ed according to PD-L1 
expression as measured by immunohistochemisty 
(IC0 and TC0 vs others), number of previous 
chemotherapy regimens (one vs two), and histology (non-
squamous vs squamous).
For overall survival analyses, patients not reported as 
having died at the time of analysis were censored at the 
date they were last known to be alive. Patients without 
information after baseline were censored at the 
randomisation date plus 1 day. For progression-free 
survival analyses, patients who were alive without disease 
progression at the time of analysis were censored at the 
time of the last tumour assessment. Patients with no 
post-baseline tumour assessment were censored at the 
randomisation date plus 1 day.
We calculated objective response rate estimates (and 
95% CIs) for the PD-L1 subgroups and overall populations 
using the Clopper-Pearson method. We estimated 
duration of response using the Kaplan-Meier method for 
patients with complete or partial responses (conﬁ rmed). 
Patients without assessment after baseline were 
considered non-responders. Duration of response was 
censored at the date of the ﬁ rst occurrence of complete or 
partial response plus 1 day if no tumour assessments 
were done after the ﬁ rst response.
We assessed primary outcomes in the intention-to-treat 
population, and safety in all randomised patients who 
received at least one dose of study drug. We did statistical 
analyses with SAS version 9.2.
An internal monitoring committee evaluated interim 
data during the course of the study. POPLAR is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993.

primary analysis data cutoﬀ  was May 8, 2015. Median 
follow-up was 14·8 months (range 0·2+ to 19·6) in the 
atezolizumab group and 15·7 months (range 0·1–18·7) 
in the docetaxel group.
Baseline characteristics were balanced between groups, 
except for an 11% greater proportion of female patients in 
the docetaxel group (35% in the atezolizumab group vs 
47% in the docetaxel group; table 1). Of 287 enrolled 
patients, 97 (34%) had squamous, and 190 (66%) had non-
squamous, disease. 189 (66%) patients had one previous 
line of chemotherapy, and 98 (34%) patients had two 
previous lines of chemotherapy. PD-L1 prevalence and 
patterns of expression on tumour cells and tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells are summarised in ﬁ gure 1. In 
addition to patients with PD-L1 expression on both cell 
types, we identiﬁ ed distinct populations of patients with 
PD-L1 expression on tumour cells only or on tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells only across all PD-L1 expression 
cutoﬀ s (eg, among patients in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 
group, 86 [30%] expressed PD-L1 only on tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells—ie, TC0 and IC1/2/3). TC3 
and IC3 tumours showed minimal overlap (<1%; ﬁ gure 1).
At a minimum follow-up of 13 months (60% of patients 
had died), atezolizumab signiﬁ cantly improved overall 
survival compared with docetaxel (12·6 vs 9·7 months; 
HR 0·73, 95% CI 0·53–0·99; p=0·04; ﬁ gure 3A).
Progression-free survival was similar between groups 
(2·7 months with atezolizumab vs 3·0 months with 
docetaxel; HR 0·94, 95% CI 0·72–1·23; appendix). 
21 (15%) patients in the atezolizumab group and 21 (15%) 
patients in the docetaxel group achieved an objective 
response (appendix).
Objective responses with atezolizumab were durable, 
with a median duration of 14·3 months (95% CI 
11·6–non-estimable) 
compared 
with 
7·2 
months 
(5·6–12·5) for docetaxel (appendix). 12 (57%) of 
21 responders in the atezolizumab group had an ongoing 
response versus ﬁ ve (24%) of 21 responders in the 
docetaxel group at the cutoﬀ  date. 
Overall survival beneﬁ t from atezolizumab increased 
with increasing PD-L1 expression on tumour cells, tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells, or both (ﬁ gure 3B–F). Overall 
survival improvement was signiﬁ cant in the TC2/3 or 
IC2/3 (HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·33–0·89; p=0·014) and TC1/2/3 
or IC1/2/3 subgroups (HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·40–0·85; 
p=0·005) compared with patients receiving docetaxel, 
corresponding to PD-L1 expression in at least 5% of cells 
and 1% of cells, respectively. Overall survival in patients 
with TC0 and IC0 PD-L1 status in the atezolizumab group 
was similar to that in docetaxel group. To assess the 
independent contribution of each level of PD-L1 
expression, we analysed non-overlapping subgroups. Each 
tumour cell or tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cell level 
independently contributed to the improvements in overall 
survival in the TC2/3 or IC2/3 and TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 
combined groups (appendix). Additionally, patients in the 
atezolizumab group with PD-L1 expression on tumour 
cells only (TC1/2/3 and IC0 subgroup) and tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells only (IC1/2/3 and TC0 subgroup) 
had improved overall survival compared with patients 
receiving docetaxel (appendix). Atezolizumab improved 
overall survival in both responding and non-responding 
patients compared with docetaxel (appendix). PD-L1 
expression on tumour cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating 
immune cells was not associated with docetaxel eﬃ  cacy.

Overall survival was also improved in atezolizumab-
treated patients with high PD-L1 gene expression, as well 
as in patients with high expression of other PD-L1–PD-1 
pathway genes in tumour tissue (PD-L1 receptors PD-1 
and B7.1, and the alternative ligand, PD-L2; ﬁ gure 4A). 
Further more, atezolizumab improved overall survival in 
patients with tumours characterised by high expression 
of T-eﬀ ector-associated and interferon-γ-associated genes 
(HR 0·43; 95% CI 0·24–0·77; ﬁ gure 4B). The T-eﬀ ector-
associated and interferon-γ-associated gene signature 
was also associated with PD-L1 expression on tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 
expression on tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells indicates 
pre-existing immunity within the tumour tissue 
(appendix). We did not see an association of the T-eﬀ ector-
associated and interferon-γ-associated gene signature 
with PD-L1 expression on tumour cells.
As with overall survival, progression-free survival and 
objective response rate tended to show increased 
atezolizumab beneﬁ t with increasing PD-L1 expression 
(appendix). The greatest improvement was in the TC3 or 
IC3 
subgroup, 
with 
progression-free 
survival 
of 
7·8 months with atezolizumab versus 3·9 months with 
docetaxel (HR 0·60, 95% CI 0·31–1·16) and nine (38%) of 
24 patients achieving an objective response with 
atezolizumab versus three (13%) of 23 with docetaxel. 
However, 
analysis 
of 
non-overlapping 
subgroups 
suggested that, unlike overall survival, improved 
progression-free survival and objective response rate with 
atezolizumab were limited to only those patients with the 
highest level of PD-L1 expression: the TC3 or IC3 
subgroup (appendix). Objective response, as measured by 
immune-modiﬁ ed RECIST criteria, was achieved in 
24 (17%; 95% CI 11·0–23·8) patients in the atezolizumab 
intention-to-treat population, similar to the objective 
response in 21 (15%; 9·3–21·4) patients, as measured by 
RECIST v1.1 criteria.
In patients with squamous disease, overall survival was 
10·1 months in 49 patients in the atezolizumab group 
and 8·6 months in 48 patients in the docetaxel group 
(HR 0·80; 0·49–1·30) in favour of atezolizumab. In the 
non-squamous group, overall survival was 15·5 months 
in 95 patients in the atezolizumab group and 10·9 months  
in 95 patients in the docetaxel group (HR 0·69; 95% CI 
0·47–1·01). Patients showed overall survival beneﬁ t with 
atezolizumab compared with docetaxel irrespective of 
tobacco use history (HR 0·75 [0·54–1·04] for patients 
with current or previous tobacco use vs 0·55 [0·24–1·25] 
for patients with no tobacco use history).
Therapies received after discontinuing study treatment 
are summarised in the appendix. No patients in the 
atezolizumab group received subsequent PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitors but seven patients in the docetaxel group 
received subsequent PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.
Despite 
longer 
median 
treatment 
duration 
(atezolizumab 3·7 months [range 0–19] vs docetaxel 
2·1 months [range 0–17]), 57 (40%) patients in the 
atezolizumab group experienced grade 3–4 adverse 
events versus 71 (53%) in the docetaxel group (table 2). 
This diﬀ erence was more evident in grade 3–4 adverse 
events assessed as related to treatment by the investigator 
(16 [11%] vs 52 [39%]). The most common atezolizumab-
related grade 3 adverse events were pneumonia (three 
[2%] patients) and increased aspartate aminotransferase 
(three [2%] patients). No atezolizumab-related grade 4 
adverse events were reported. The most common adverse

treatment-related adverse events by grade are shown in 
ﬁ gure 5B. Related adverse events diﬀ ering by 10% or 
more between groups are shown in the appendix. Other 
immune-mediated adverse events of any grade with 
atezolizumab were increased aspartate aminotransferase 
(six [4%] patients, three at grade 3–4), increased alanine 
aminotransferase (six [4%] patients, three at grade 3–4), 
pneumonitis (four [3%] patients, one at grade 3–4), colitis 
(two [1%] patients, one at grade 3–4), and hepatitis (one 
[1%] patient, grade 1–2). Fewer patients discontinued 
treatment with atezolizumab than with docetaxel (11 [8%] 
vs 30 [22%]). Grade 5 adverse events were cardiac failure 
(related 
to 
study 
treatment), 
pneumonia, 
ulcer 
haemorrhage, pneumothorax, pul monary embolism, 
and embolism in the atezolizumab group (one patient 
each) and sepsis (two patients; one related to study 
treatment), death from unknown causes (two patients; 
one related to study treatment), and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (one patient; related to study 
treatment) in the docetaxel group (table 2).
Discussion
Atezolizumab showed signiﬁ cant improvement in overall 
survival compared with docetaxel in patients with 
advanced, previously treated NSCLC, unselected for PD-L1 
expression. Improvement in overall survival increased 
with increasing PD-L1 expression, whereas patients with 
the lowest PD-L1 expression levels experienced overall 
survival similar to that in the docetaxel group. Eﬃ  cacy 
outcomes of patients in the docetaxel group compared 
favourably with those in previous clinical trials in the 
second-line setting.25–29 Baseline characteristics were 
balanced except for the higher proportion of female 
patients in the docetaxel group; in some studies, female 
sex has been associated with improved survival in patients 
with advanced NSCLC, which could have resulted in 
increased survival in the docetaxel group of our study.30 
Patients with either squamous or non-squamous NSCLC 
exhibited a numerical improvement in overall survival 
with atezolizumab compared with docetaxel.
Atezolizumab was well tolerated with a safety proﬁ le 
consistent with previous studies,4 and we identiﬁ ed no 
new safety signals. The safety proﬁ le was distinct from 
that of docetaxel, with lower rates of drug discontinuations 
due to adverse events, grade 3–4 adverse events, and 
adverse events common to chemotherapy, including 
nausea, cytopenias, and peripheral neuropathy; most 
atezolizumab-associated toxicities were low grade. 
Potential immune-mediated adverse events, such as 
increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine 
aminotransferase, pneumonitis, colitis, and hepatitis 
occurred at low frequencies (<5%) in the atezolizumab 
group and were generally manageable and reversible.

regulation of antitumour immunity and predicting 
response to therapy.
Very few patients (<1%) had co-expression of PD-L1 on 
both tumour cells and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells 
at the highest levels (ie, TC3 and IC3), suggesting that 
TC3 and IC3 are distinct subpopulations in NSCLC. The 
association of PD-L1 expression on tumour-inﬁ ltrating 
immune cells with the T-eﬀ ector and interferon-γ gene 
signature, a hallmark of pre-existing immunity, further 
supports the hypothesis that PD-L1 expression is 
regulated by diﬀ erent mechanisms in NSCLC: an 
intrinsic mechanism on tumour cells and an adaptive 
mechanism on immune cells.4 An adaptive mechanism 
on immune cells is consistent with previous reports of 
adaptive PD-L1 regulation in highly inﬂ amed tumours.31
Importantly, PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and 
tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells independently pre-
dicted improved overall survival with atezolizumab. This 
ﬁ nding contrasts with anti-PD-1 studies that showed an 
association with tumour cell PD-L1 expression only.7–10 
PD-L1 expression on tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells as 
a predictive biomarker is further supported by the 
association of T-eﬀ ector and interferon γ gene signature 
with improved overall survival. These data are also 
consistent with the hypothesis that beneﬁ t from 
checkpoint inhibition is pronounced in tumours with 
pre-existing immunity. Taken together, these ﬁ ndings 
conﬁ rm the importance of assessing PD-L1 on tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells, in addition to tumour cells, as 
a predictive biomarker to identify patients most likely to 
beneﬁ t 
from 
atezolizumab. 
Neither 
PD-L1 
immunohistochemistry nor T-eﬀ ector and interferon-γ 
gene expression was associated with prognostic 
signiﬁ cance on overall survival for docetaxel-treated 
patients.
High expression of PD-L2 from within the tumour was 
associated 
with 
improved 
overall 
survival 
for 
atezolizumab treatment, despite atezolizumab leaving 
the PD-L2–PD-1 interaction intact. Expression of PD-L2 
has previously been associated with that of PD-L1,32 and 
does not seem to confer inhibition of the anticancer 
immunity generated by atezolizumab therapy. These 
data suggest that blocking the PD-L1–PD-1 and 
PD-L1–B7.1 interactions and not the PD-L2–PD-1 
interaction is suﬃ  cient to provide strong eﬃ  cacy in 
patients expressing the highest levels of PD-L2, but the 
role of PD-L2 in anticancer immunity remains unclear.
Our results also highlight a unique relation between 
measures of atezolizumab eﬃ  cacy (overall survival, 
progression-free survival, and objective response rate). 
Namely, overall survival, but not progression-free 
survival or objective response rate, improved with 
atezolizumab 
treatment 
in 
the 
intention-to-treat 
population and in PD-L1 expression subgroups deﬁ ned 
by 1% or more and 5% or more tumour cell or tumour-
inﬁ ltrating 
immune 
cell 
staining. 
The 
strong 
improvement in overall survival without an improvement 
in progression-free survival or objective response rate in 
these populations, together with the observation that 
overall survival improved with atezolizumab in both 
responding and non-responding patients, implies that 
standard radiographic endpoints might underestimate 
treatment beneﬁ t with atezolizumab. These  results 
suggest that some patients beneﬁ t after RECIST-deﬁ ned 
progression, possibly because of delayed anticancer 
immune eﬀ ects.
A key strength of POPLAR was that this study enrolled 
patients irrespective of PD-L1 status, which was 
prospectively assessed on both tumour cells and tumour-
inﬁ ltrating immune cells. The main limitation of 
POPLAR was the moderate size of the trial, reducing the 
ability to draw conclusions about atezolizumab beneﬁ t in 
smaller subgroups of patients. Therefore, further 
assessment of atezolizumab eﬃ  cacy in this patient 
population, including more precise assessment of 
treatment eﬀ ects in subgroups, will be provided by the 
phase 
3 
OAK 
study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number 
NCT02008227).
In conclusion, our data show that atezolizumab 
provides survival beneﬁ t in previously treated patients 
with NSCLC, and that PD-L1 expression on tumour cells 
and tumour-inﬁ ltrating immune cells is predictive of 
this beneﬁ t. Additionally, the exploratory analyses of 
T-eﬀ ector and interferon γ gene signature deepens our 
understanding of mechanisms of response to anti-PD-L1 
blockade and provides a starting point for development 
of 
future 
predictive 
biomarkers 
for 
cancer 
immunotherapies. These data, along with those from 
other atezolizumab studies in patients with previously 
treated NSCLC, demonstrate the clinical eﬃ  cacy and 
safety of targeting PD-L1 with atezolizumab in this 
patient population.
