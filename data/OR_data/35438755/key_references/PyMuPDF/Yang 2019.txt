ABSTRACT
Introduction: Osimertinib is a third-generation EGFR-
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Durvalumab is an anti–
programmed death ligand 1 monoclonal antibody. The
phase III open-label CAURAL trial (NCT02454933) investi-
gated osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib
monotherapy in patients with EGFR-TKI sensitizing and
EGFR T790M mutation–positive advanced NSCLC and dis-
ease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy.
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive
orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with
or without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intrave-
nously every 2 weeks) until progression. Treatment could
continue beyond progression, providing clinical beneﬁt
continued (judged by the investigator). The amended pri-
mary objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of
osimertinib plus durvalumab; efﬁcacy was an exploratory
objective.

Results:
CAURAL
recruitment
was
terminated
early
because of increased incidence of interstitial lung disease–
like events in the osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from
the separate phase Ib TATTON trial (NCT02143466). At
termination of CAURAL recruitment, 15 patients had been
randomly assigned to treatment with osimertinib and 14 to
treatment with osimertinib plus durvalumab. The most
common AEs were diarrhea (53% [grade 3 in 6% of
patients]) in the osimertinib arm and rash (67% [grade 3
in 0 patients]) in the combination arm. One patient who had
been randomized to the combination arm reported grade 2
interstitial lung disease while receiving osimertinib mono-
therapy (after discontinuing durvalumab therapy after one
dose). The objective response rates were 80% in the osi-
mertinib arm and 64% in the combination arm.
Conclusion: Limited patient numbers preclude formal
safety and efﬁcacy comparisons between the two treatment
arms. The combination of programmed cell death 1/pro-
grammed death ligand 1 inhibitors and EGFR-TKIs as
therapy for NSCLC is not well understood, but it requires a
careful approach if considered in the future.

Introduction
Mutations in the EGFR gene are observed in approx-
imately 40% and 20% of patients with NSCLC in Asian
and non-Asian populations, respectively.1 Osimertinib, a
third-generation, central nervous system–active, irre-
versible EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is selec-
tive for both EGFR-TKI sensitizing mutations (EGFRm)
and EGFR T790M resistance mutations.2,3 Osimertinib is
a treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC
harboring EGFRm in the ﬁrst-line setting and the treat-
ment of choice for patients with T790M-positive NSCLC
after disease progression during treatment with a ﬁrst-
line EGFR-TKI.2,3
Durvalumab, a selective, high-afﬁnity, engineered
human immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody, blocks
binding of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) to
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CD80
molecule.4 Murine models have demonstrated signiﬁcant
response to anti–PD-1 antibody treatment in EGFR-
mutant tumors.5 EGFR activation has been shown to
induce PD-L1 expression; therefore, EGFR-TKIs may
enhance antitumor immunity through downregulation of
PD-L1.5,6 The phase III, open-label, randomized CAURAL
trial
(NCT02454933)
was
planned
to
investigate
osimertinib plus durvalumab versus osimertinib mono-
therapy in patients with T790M-positive advanced
NSCLC and disease progression after EGFR-TKI therapy.
CAURAL recruitment terminated early after the
interim safety results from a phase 1b study of osi-
mertinib plus durvalumab for EGFRm NSCLC (TATTON
[NCT02143466]), which observed a higher than ex-
pected incidence of interstitial lung disease (ILD)-like
events (13 of 34 patients [38%]), none of which were
fatal.7
We present CAURAL safety and efﬁcacy results.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (in
Japan, 20 years) and had a WHO performance status of
0 or 1 and EGFRm locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC
(stage IIIB–IV). Radiological documentation of disease
progression after EGFR-TKI therapy was mandatory;
other lines of therapy also may have been given. Cen-
trally conﬁrmed T790M-positive tumor status from a
biopsy sample taken after disease progression during
the most recent therapy was required. Patients with
stable, asymptomatic, central nervous system metastases
were eligible. Patients with a history or evidence of
clinically active ILD or radiation pneumonitis were
ineligible.
Trial Design and Treatment
Patients were randomized centrally (1:1) to receive
orally administered osimertinib (80 mg once daily) with
or without durvalumab (10 mg/kg administered intra-
venously every 2 weeks). The stratiﬁcation factors were
previous lines of treatment (one versus two or more),
and ethnicity (Asian versus non-Asian). Treatment could
continue beyond disease progression, provided clinical
beneﬁt continued (judged by the investigator).
Objectives
The amended primary objective was assessment of
safety and tolerability of osimertinib plus durvalumab.
Exploratory objectives included the safety of osimertinib
and efﬁcacy of osimertinib monotherapy and combina-
tion therapy.
Outcome Measures
Safety and tolerability outcome measures included
adverse events (AEs) graded by the Common Terminol-
ogy Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4. The efﬁcacy
outcome
measures
included
investigator-assessed
(according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors, version 1.1) objective response rate (ORR),
duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival

(PFS), tumor shrinkage, disease control rate, and overall
survival (OS).
Statistical Analysis
Safety data were summarized according to random-
ized treatment received in the safety analysis set
(patients who received at least one dose). Efﬁcacy data
were summarized according to randomized treatment in
the full analysis set (all randomized patients regardless
of treatment received). At time of recruitment termina-
tion, the sample size was too small for formal statistical
comparisons between arms; summaries are descriptive.
PFS, DoR, and OS were summarized by using Kaplan-
Meier estimates. ORR was summarized with associated
95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) by using the Clopper-
Pearson method. The data cutoff (DCO) date was
March 21, 2018. These are the ﬁnal data to be reported
from this study.
Trial Oversight
The trial was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines,
applicable
regulatory
requirements,
and
policy
on
bioethics and human biologic samples of the trial
sponsor, AstraZeneca. The trial was funded by the
sponsor and designed by the principal investigators and
sponsor.
Results
Patients and Treatment
A total of 29 patients from nine centers in South
Korea, Canada, and the Republic of China (Taiwan) were
randomized: 15 to osimertinib monotherapy and 14 to
osimertinib
plus
durvalumab
combination
therapy
(Table 1 and Fig. 1). Two patients were incorrectly
randomized to combination therapy, switched to osi-
mertinib therapy, and never received durvalumab.
All 12 patients who received durvalumab stopped
taking it during the study owing to disease progression
(n ¼ 5), AE (n ¼ 3 [with two of these cases possibly
causally related]), patient withdrawal (n ¼ 3), or inves-
tigator decision (n ¼ 1). The median duration of
durvalumab treatment was 10.0 months (range 0–27
months). In all, 22 patients (76%) (12 of whom received
osimertinib alone and 10 of whom received combination
therapy) discontinued osimertinib during the study
because of disease progression (n ¼ 17), an AE (n ¼ 2),
or patient withdrawal (n ¼ 3). Seven patients (24%)
(ﬁve who were receiving osimertinib and two who were
receiving combination therapy) were still receiving osi-
mertinib at DCO. The median duration of osimertinib
treatment
was
21.1
months
overall
(range
2–30
months), and the median durations of treatment were
23.9 and 17.1 months in the osimertinib and combina-
tion arms, respectively (Fig. 2).
Safety
Overall,
all
patients
in
the
safety
analysis
set
(17 patients who received osimertinib monotherapy and
12 who received combination therapy) had at least one
AE (mostly grade 1 or 2) (Tables 2 and 3). The most
commonly reported AEs, regardless of causality and
severity, were diarrhea (n ¼ 9 [53%]), rash (n ¼ 9
[53%]), and paronychia (n ¼ 7 [41%]) in the osimertinib
arm and rash (n ¼ 8 [67%]), diarrhea (n ¼ 6 [50%]), and
decreased appetite (n ¼ 6 [50%]) in the combination arm.
Only one patient (3%) (who was randomized to
combination therapy) had ILD reported (grade 2). The
patient
discontinued
durvalumab
therapy
(consent
withdrawal) on day 1 after one dose; the event was
reported on day 63 while the patient was receiving
osimertinib. The investigator reported it as a serious AE
(because of hospitalization) that was possibly causally
related to osimertinib and unrelated to durvalumab.
The study treatment was discontinued permanently in

Osimertinib Plus Durvalumab versus Osimertinib
5

Efﬁcacy
In the osimertinib arm, 12 of 15 patients had
a conﬁrmed partial response (ORR 80% [95% CI: 52–
96]); in the combination arm, nine of 14 patients had
a conﬁrmed partial response (ORR 64% [95% CI:
35–87]). The median DoR was 17.5 months (95% CI:
9.1–not calculable) in the osimertinib arm versus 21.4
months (95% CI: 6.4–not calculable) in the combina-
tion arm. The disease control rate was 100% (95%
CI: 78–100) in the osimertinib arm versus 93% (95%
CI: 66–100) in the combination arm. All patients had
a reduction in target lesion size compared with
baseline (Fig. 3).
Conﬁrmed (according to the Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors) progression was documented
in four of 15 patients (27%) in the osimertinib arm and
four of 14 (29%) in the combination arm. The median
PFS was 19.3 months in the osimertinib arm versus
not reached in the combination arm. The 12-month
progression-free rates were 82% and 76%, respectively.
At DCO, two of 15 patients (13%) in the osimertinib
arm and four of 14 patients (29%) in the combination
arm had died. The median OS was not reached in either
arm; the 12-month survival rate was 100% for the
osimertinib arm versus 86% (95% CI: 54–96) for the
combination arm.
Discussion
As limited patients were randomized, formal safety
and efﬁcacy comparisons between treatment arms were
not possible. However, we observed no trends suggest-
ing the combination therapy to be superior to osimerti-
nib alone; the response to osimertinib monotherapy
was consistent with the existing efﬁcacy proﬁle seen in
phase II/III trials of osimertinib in patients with T790M-
positive advanced NSCLC.8,9 There were no new safety
signals for osimertinib in combination with durvalumab
or as monotherapy.
A meta-analysis of ﬁrst-generation EGFR-TKI mono-
therapy (geﬁtinib/erlotinib) studies reported an ILD
incidence at 1.2% (95% CI: 0.9–1.6%), ranging from 0%
to 5%.10 The incidence of ILD with osimertinib is in line
with that for ﬁrst-generation EGFR-TKIs, with rates of
2% to 4% in large phase II/III trials.8,9,11
An unexpectedly high incidence of ILD-like events (in
13 of 34 patients [38%]) was reported in the osimertinib
plus durvalumab arm of TATTON.7 In CAURAL, only one
ILD event was reported in 12 patients who received
Figure 3. Best percentage change in target lesion size (full analysis set). Best change in target lesion size is the maximum
reduction from baseline or the minimum increase from baseline in the absence of a reduction. Patients with at least one
postbaseline Response Criteria in Solid Tumors–based target lesion assessment scan before any progression event are
included. The line at 20% represents the boundary for determination of progressive disease, and the line at 30% represents
the boundary for determination of partial response.

osimertinib plus durvalumab. The event, which was of
grade 2 severity, occurred in a 60-year-old female Asian
patient, who had discontinued durvalumab after one
dose; ILD was reported on day 63 while she was
receiving osimertinib. There remain limited data inves-
tigating EGFR-TKI therapy in combination with immu-
notherapy, but no ILD events were reported from a trial
of 21 patients treated with erlotinib and nivolumab
(NCT01454102).12 Similarly, preliminary results from a
phase I study evaluating durvalumab and geﬁtinib in
patients with EGFRm NSCLC (NCT02088112) demon-
strated that the combination was generally tolerated.13
However, the efﬁcacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor mono-
therapy in EGFRm NSCLC has not been widely demon-
strated, and potential for added beneﬁt when combined
with EGFR-TKIs of any generation is not conﬁrmed.14,15
Why reported ILD frequencies differ between the
osimertinib plus durvalumab arm from TATTON and that
from CAURAL remains unclear. In TATTON, most ILD-like
events (seven of 11 [64%]) were reported in part B
(in EGFR-TKI treatment–naive patients with EGFRm
NSCLC who received osimertinib [80 mg once daily] plus
durvalumab
[10
mg/kg
administered
intravenously
every 2 weeks]).7 Part A included patients with EGFRm
NSCLC who had progressed after previous EGFR-TKI
therapy (as in CAURAL) and received osimertinib (80 mg
once daily) plus durvalumab (either 3 mg/kg adminis-
tered intravenously every 2 weeks [dose 1] or 10 mg/kg
administered intravenously every 2 weeks [dose 2, as in
CAURAL]); ILD was reported in two of 10 patients (20%)
in part A at dose 1, and four of 13 patients (31%) in part A
at dose 2. The overall median time to ILD onset was 69
days in TATTON parts A and B.7
Although
the
patient
numbers
were
limited
in
CAURAL, there was no obvious beneﬁt to combining
durvalumab with osimertinib in comparison with osi-
mertinib monotherapy.
