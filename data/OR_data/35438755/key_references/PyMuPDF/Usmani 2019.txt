Summary
Background Lenalidomide and dexamethasone has been a standard of care in transplant-ineligible patients with newly 
diagnosed multiple myeloma. The addition of a third drug to the combination is likely to improve treatment efficacy. 
KEYNOTE-185 assessed the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone with and without pembrolizumab 
in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of an unplanned interim analysis 
done to assess the benefit–risk of the combination at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Methods KEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 95 medical centres across 15 countries 
(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Spain, 
UK, and USA). Transplantation-ineligible patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and who were treatment naive were enrolled, and 
randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone alone using an interactive voice or integrated web response system. Patients received oral lenalidomide 
25 mg on days 1–21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles, with or without 
intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was 
investigator-assessed because of early trial termination. Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients and 
safety was analysed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered at 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863, and it is closed for accrual.
Findings Between Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 301 patients were randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=150). On 
July 3, 2017, the FDA decided to halt the study because of the imbalance in the proportion of death between groups. At 
database cutoff (June 2, 2017), with a median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6), 149 patients in the pembrolizumab 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had received 
their assigned study drug. Median progression-free survival was not reached in either group; progression-free survival 
estimates at 6-months were 82·0% (95% CI 73·2–88·1) versus 85·0% (76·8–90·5; hazard ratio [HR] 1·22; 95% CI 
0·67–2·22; p=0·75). Serious adverse events were reported in 81 (54%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone group versus 57 (39%) patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; the most common 
serious adverse events were pneumonia (nine [6%]) and pyrexia (seven [5%]) in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone group and pneumonia (eight [6%]) and sepsis (two [1%]) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group. Six (4%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group 
(cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, myocarditis, large intestine perforation, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism) and 
two (1%) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and respiratory failure).
Interpretation The results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit–risk profile 
of pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with newly diagnosed, 
previously untreated multiple myeloma. Long-term safety and survival follow-up is ongoing.

Standard of care for patients with transplantation-
ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the USA 
consists of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, with or 
without bortezomib.3,4 The European Society for Medical 
Oncology clinical practice guidelines recommend another 
option in the non-transplantation setting: bortezomib, 
melphalan, and prednisone.5,6 Addition of daratumumab 
to bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone lowered the 
risk of disease progression and death in patients in the 
first line setting, resulting in another efficacious and safe 
treatment option.7 Most patients with myeloma relapse; 
so new treatment options for subsequent lines of therapy 
are needed.
Plasma cells from most patients with multiple 
myeloma express PD-L1,8 and PD-L1 upregulation is 
associated with disease relapse.9 Combination PD-1 and 
PD-L1 blockade and lenalidomide showed enhanced 
effector cell-mediated multiple myeloma cytotoxicity.10 
Thus, immune check­points might be important in 
myeloma resistance and are an attractive therapeutic 
target. Combination of immune checkpoint inhibition 
and lenalidomide plus dexa­methasone might provide 
synergistic antitumour activity in patients with multiple 
myeloma.11 The PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab as 
monotherapy or combined with lenalidomide and low-
dose dexamethasone or pomalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone had shown acceptable safety and 
promising antitumour activity in 50% (monotherapy) 
and 60% (in combination) of patients with relapsed 
refractory multiple myeloma.12–14 We hypothesised that 
inhibiting the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway in patients with 
treatment-naive multiple myeloma might improve 
efficacy outcomes. This KEYNOTE-185 trial was done to 
assess safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone versus lenalidomide 
and dexa­methasone alone in patients with treatment-
naive multiple myeloma. Here, we present the results of 
an unplanned interim analysis done to assess the 
benefit–risk profile of the combination therapy at the 
request of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a PubMed search using the keywords “multiple 
myeloma” and “PD-1” filtered by “article type: clinical trial” and 
“publication dates: 01/01/2013 to 11/27/2018” with no 
language restrictions, which yielded only two results relevant to 
multiple myeloma (a third article was on melanoma). Both 
studies involved a PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab or 
nivolumab, in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma and showed promising efficacy and safety. These 
results raise a pertinent unanswered question regarding the use 
of PD-1 inhibitors combined with immunomodulators and 
dexamethasone as first-line treatment in patients with multiple 
myeloma. We did another search of PubMed on Nov 27, 2018, 
with the keywords, “multiple myeloma” and 
“transplantation-ineligible” using the same filters and found six 
results. In the phase 3 FIRST study of lenalidomide and 
low-dose dexamethasone until disease progression, or 
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone for 72 weeks, or 
melphalan, prednisone, and thalidomide for 72 weeks in 
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, overall 
survival was improved with continuous lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone compared with with melphalan, prednisone, 
and thalidomide. In the second article, the alkylator-containing 
triplets, melphalan, prednisone, and lenalidomide, were shown 
to be not superior to the alkylator-free lenalidomide and low-
dose dexamethasone doublet in patients with 
transplantation-ineligible multiple myeloma. These results 
provide support for the choice of the comparator group in this 
study, KEYNOTE-185. The third, fourth, and fifth articles 
concerned regimens—such as bortezomib and dexamethasone 
or bortezomib, thalidomide, and dexamethasone and 
bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone—based on the 
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in newly diagnosed 
transplantation-ineligible multiple myeloma. In the phase 3b 
UPFRONT study in US community practices, all 
bortezomib-containing regimens showed favourable 
outcomes. The phase 3 ALCYONE study showed that the 
addition of daratumumab to bortezomib, melphalan, and 
prednisone led to a lower risk of disease progression or death 
but an increased occurrence of grade 3 or 4 infections. The sixth 
article reported results of the phase 3, SWOG SO777 study and 
showed that the addition of bortezomib to lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone improved survival outcomes.
Added value of this study
The phase 3 KEYNOTE-185 study was done to assess the 
efficacy and safety of the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab 
with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in 
transplantation-ineligible patients with newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma. Preclinical evidence reported by Gorgun and 
colleagues in 2015 suggested that combination of PD-1 
blockade with lenalidomide resulted in greater antitumour 
activity in multiple myeloma. However, an unplanned interim 
analysis of KEYNOTE-185, done at a median follow-up of 
6·6 months at the request of the US FDA, showed an 
unfavourable benefit–risk profile for the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone combination and 
KEYNOTE-185 was halted.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although KEYNOTE-185 is unlikely to change clinical practice in 
light of alternative, efficacious, and safe triplet and quadruplet 
treatments in this setting, it is likely to provide valuable 
information to guide the design of future clinical studies 
involving checkpoint inhibitors in newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma.

Methods
Study design and participants
KEYNOTE-185 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 
trial of pembrolizumab with lenalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone versus lenalidomide and low-dose 
dexamethasone in newly diagnosed and previously un­
treated patients with multiple myeloma. Patients were 
enrolled at 95 medical centres across 15 countries 
(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, South Africa, 
Spain, UK, and USA; appendix 1 pp 3–5). The protocol 
and its amendments were approved by the appropriate 
institutional review board or independent ethics 
committee. The trial was done in accordance with Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of 
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed 
consent.
Patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed, 
treatment-naive, 
active 
multiple 
myeloma 
with 
measurable disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and 
adequate organ function were enrolled. Patients had to 
be ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation 
because of age (≥65 years) or any clinically significant 
co-existing medical condition (cardiac, renal, pulmonary, 
or hepatic dysfunction) likely to have a negative effect on 
their tolerability of autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Patients also had to provide bone marrow biopsy samples 
or aspirate material for disease assessment. Measurable 
disease was defined as at least 10% bone marrow plasma 
cell percentage, biopsy proven bony, or extramedullary 
plasmacytoma; serum monoclonal protein concentration 
of at least 5 g/L, urine monoclonal protein concentration 
of at least 200 mg per 24 h or, if monoclonal protein is 
not measurable, an abnormal serum free light chain 
ratio with involved free light chain concentration of at 
least 100 mg/L; and presence of hypercalcaemia, renal 
impairment, anaemia, or bone disease. Adequate organ 
function was assessed as absolute neutrophil count 
more than 1000 per µL, platelets at least 75 000 per µL, 
haemoglobin of at least 75 g/L, creatinine maximum 
1·5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine 
clearance at least 30 mL/min, total bilirubin maximum 
1·5 times the ULN, aspartate transaminase and alanine 
transaminase maximum 2·5 times the ULN, and 
international normal­ized ratio or prothrombin time 
maximum 1·5 times the ULN. Exclusion criteria were 
oligosecretory myeloma; smouldering multiple mye­
loma; monoclonal gammopathy of unknown signifi­
cance; Waldenström’s macroglobulin­aemia; history of 
plasma cell leukaemia; history of repeated infections or 
immunosuppression; history of or active pneumonitis 
necessitating steroids; active autoimmune disease 
requiring systemic treatment in the past 2 years; active 
infections necessitating intravenous systemic treatment; 
grade 2 or worse peripheral neuropathy; known HIV, 
active hepatitis B, or active hepatitis C infection; and live 
vaccine within 30 days of the first dose of study 
medication. Other exclusion criteria were previous 
therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-
CD137, 
or 
anti-cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte-associated 
antigen-4 antibody; previous anti-myeloma therapy, 
previous or current participation in another anti-mye­
loma therapy study; previous allogeneic haemo­poietic 
stem cell transplantation in the past 5 years; known 
hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs; known 
additional malignancy requiring active treatment in past 
5 years; known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders 
that would interfere with study compliance; pregnant or 
breastfeeding or expecting to conceive within projected 
duration of the trial; unable or unwilling to undergo 
thrombo­embolic 
prophylaxis; 
lactose 
intolerance; 
invasive fungal infection; and immediate relative who is 
investigational site or funder staff involved in this trial.
Randomisation and masking
Patients 
were 
randomly 
assigned 
1:1 
to 
the 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group 
using an interactive voice or integrated web response 
system (randomised allocation schedules were generated 
by the funder). Randomisation was stratified by age 
(<75 vs ≥75 years) and International Staging System stage 
(I or II vs III). There was no masking of treatment 
allocation in this open-label trial.
Procedures
Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab plus oral 
lenalidomide and oral low-dose dexamethasone or 
lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone. Lenalidomide 
was given as 25 mg daily on days 1–21 and dexamethasone 
as 40 mg daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day 
cycles with or without pembrolizumab 200 mg 
intravenously every 3 weeks. The dexamethasone dose 
was 20 mg for patients older than 75 years. Patients 
received study treatment until documented confirmed 
disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or 
withdrawal from study.
Progression-free survival and response endpoints were 
investigator-assessed. Every 4 weeks, response was 
assessed per International Myeloma Working Group 2011 
response criteria.15 Response was also assessed using a 
full myeloma laboratory panel and calcium, creatinine, 
and haemoglobin laboratory results, radio­graphy (x-ray or 
MRI or CT or MRI with PET or CT with PET as clinically 
indicated) for patients with extramedullary soft tissue 
plasmacytomas and bone marrow biopsy specimen or 
aspirate material for confirmation of complete response 
or disease progression. Low-dose CT and MRI bone 
surveys were allowed.
Cytogenetic analyses were done locally and not 
assessed centrally; CD138 selection was not done at all 
centres. Analysis of baseline lactate dehydrogenase 
concentrations was not available.

Patients were followed up for survival status every 
12 weeks after end of study treatment and monitored 
for adverse events until 30 days (90 days for serious 
adverse events) after the end of study treatment. 
Adverse events were graded per National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0.
The trial was to be terminated prematurely if quality or 
quantity of data recording was inaccurate or incomplete, 
adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements was 
poor, there were plans to modify or discontinue 
development of pembrolizumab, or in response to a 
request by the FDA or other health authority because of 
safety concerns.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, 
defined as the time from random group assignment to the 
first documented instance of disease progression or death 
from any cause, whichever occurred first. Secondary 
endpoints were safety, overall survival, overall response, 
duration of response, disease control, and secondary 
progression-free survival (time from random­isation to 
subsequent disease progression after initiation of new 
anti-cancer therapy or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first, based on investigator assessment; not 
reported here). Overall survival was defined as time from 
randomisation to death from any cause. Overall response 
was defined as the proportion of patients who achieved at 
least a partial response per International Myeloma 
Working Group 2011 criteria based on central review. 
Duration of response was defined as the time from first 
documented evidence of at least a partial response by 
central review until disease progression or death. Overall 
responses (complete response, very good partial response, 
partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease) 
were defined per the International Myeloma Working 
Group 2011 criteria (appendix 1 p 15). Disease control was 
defined per International Myeloma Working Group 2011 
criteria as the percentage of patients who achieved 
confirmed 
stringent 
complete 
response, 
complete 
response, very good partial response, partial response, 
minimal response, or stable disease per central review for 
at least 12 weeks before any evidence of progression. 
Median time to progression (time from randomisation to 
first documented instance of pro­gression) was assessed. 
Immune-mediated adverse events, defined as adverse 
events (non-serious and serious) associated with 
pembrolizumab exposure that were consistent with 
immune phenomena and that had a potentially 
immunological cause, were prespecified as events of 
interest.
Statistical analysis
A sample size of 640 patients was planned. For 
progression-free survival, based on 227 events, the study 
had 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65 with 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
versus lenalidomide and dexamethasone at a one-sided α 
of 2·5%. The sample size calculation was based on the 
following assumptions: (1) progression-free survival 
follows an exponential distribution with a median of 
25·5 months in the control group; (2) enrolment period is 
18 months with at least 12 months’ follow-up; and 
(3) cumulative dropout of participants is 2% at the end of 
the first year and 5% at 4 years.

Hypothesis testing of objective response, progression-
free survival, and overall survival was strongly controlled 
by a family-wise type I error rate of 2·5% (one-sided α). 
Boundaries and the α level were established from the 
actual number of events at the time of the interim 
analysis using the corresponding α-spending function.16 
A stepdown approach was used to control the type I 
error rate for the testing of endpoints. The primary 
endpoint (progression-free survival) was tested first; 
then, if significant, the secondary endpoint (overall 
survival) was tested.16 Patients were censored for overall 
survival analysis at the last date they were known to 
be alive.
Progression-free survival and overall survival were 
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients who 
did not have documented disease progression or did not 
die were censored for progression-free survival analysis 
at the last disease assessment. Treatment difference 
between groups was assessed using the stratified log-
rank test. HRs and associated 95% CIs between treatment 
groups were calculated using a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model with the Efron method of tie handling. 
Age and International Staging System were used in the 
stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. 
Additional details are in appendix 1 (p 2).
Overall responses and disease control were compared 
between treatment groups using the stratified Miettinen 
and Nurminen method17 and were stratified by age and 
International Staging System stage. Duration of response 
was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. To analyse 
duration of response, patients with missing data were 
censored at the last assessment date if they responded at 
the time of analysis.
One interim analysis was planned when all patients 
had been enrolled and about 115 progression-free survival 
events had been observed. The interim analysis was 
planned for potential early detection of superiority (with 
group sequential boundaries) or futility (with non-
binding bounds) of pembrolizumab plus standard of 
care versus standard of care alone.
Efficacy was analysed in all randomly assigned patients 
(intention-to-treat population). Safety was analysed in all 
randomly assigned patients who received at least 
one dose of their assigned study drug (safety population). 
SAS software, version 9.4, was used for statistical 
analyses. Full statistical plans to continue or stop the trial 
are provided in the protocol available in appendix 2 
(pp 102–15). An external data monitoring committee 
monitored interim data and made re­commend­ations to 
the executive oversight committee about overall risk and 
benefit to trial participants. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02579863.
Role of the funding source
The funder was involved in study design, data analysis 
data interpretation, and writing of the report, but not 
data collection. All authors had access to all the data and 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication.
Results
400 patients were screened for enrolment at 95 sites in 
15 countries. 90 were ineligible and nine were not 
assigned to a group before the study was halted 
(figure 1). Between Jan 7, 2016, and June 9, 2017, 
301 
patients 
were 
randomly 
assigned 
to 
the 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group (n=151) or the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group (n=150) group. Of these, 149 in the pembrolizumab 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 145 in 
the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group received 
their assigned treatment. In the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group, 34 patients 
discontinued because of adverse events and eight

because of disease progression; in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group, 20 discontinued because of 
adverse events and 11 because of progression (figure 1). 
The most commonly reported adverse events that led to 
discon­tinuation are in appendix 1 (p 16). 156 patients 
started treatment with a dose of 20 mg of dexamethasone 
(78 in each group).
Changes made to the trial protocol after the start of the 
study are in appendix 1 (pp 6–14). On July 3, 2017, the 
FDA halted this trial on the basis of interim data 
presented to the data monitoring committee, which 
showed 
an 
unfavourable 
benefit–risk 
profile 
of 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone.18 
Based on that decision, all patients stopped study 
treatment, completed the discontinuation visit, and 
moved into the long-term safety and survival follow-up 
period per protocol; a long-term survival analysis is 
planned. Per the FDA decision, no long-term efficacy 
data will be collected. Quality-of-life assessments will not 
be reported because of early trial termination. Subsequent 
treatment decisions were made by the physicians per 
standard of care; data will not be collected.
At database cutoff (June 2, 2017), median follow-up was 
6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6). Baseline characteristics were 
mostly similar between the groups, except high-risk 
cytogenetics (24 [16%] of 151 in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group vs ten [7%] of 
150 in the lena­lidomide and dexamethasone group), 
anaemia (84 [56%] vs 68 of [45%]), and renal impairment 
(21 [14%] vs 12 [8%]; table 1).
The primary endpoint of median progression-free 
survival was not reached in either group; 24 (16%) 
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group and 20 (13%) patients in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had had a 
progression-free survival event at analysis. The HR for 
progression-free survival was 1·22 (95% CI 0·67–2·22; 
p=0·75; figure 2A). Progression-free survival was 
88·5% 
(81·3–93·0) 
in 
the 
pembro­lizumab 
plus 
lenalidomide 
and 
dexamethasone 
group 
versus 
89·3% (82·3–93·7) in the lenalidomide and dexa­metha­
sone group at 3 months and 82·0% (73·2–88·1) versus 
85·0% (76·8–90·5) at 6 months. Median time to 
progression was not reached in either group; six (4%) in 
the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexa­
methasone group versus 11 (7%) in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group had progression events, and the 
HR was 0·55 (0·20–1·50; p=0·12; figure 2B).
Median overall survival was not reached in either group; 
19 (13%) patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone group versus nine (6%) in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group died, and the HR 
was 2·06 (95% CI 0·93–4·55; p=0·97; figure 2C). 3-month 
overall survival was achieved by 94·7% (89·3–97·5) of 
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group versus 91·8% (85·7–95·4) in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; 6-month overall 
survival was achieved by 87·2% (79·9–92·0) versus 
93·9% (88·1–96·9).

(partial response or better). Disease control results were 
also similar between groups: 123 (82%; 95% CI 74·3–87·3) 
patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group versus 127 (85%; 77·9–90·0) in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group achieved disease 
control (appendix 1 p 17). Median time to response was 
1·1 months (95% CI 1·0–1·9) in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide 
and 
dexamethasone 
group 
versus 
1·1 months (1·0–1·3) in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group, and median duration of response 
was not reached in either group (appendix 1 p 18). Kaplan-
Meier estimates for response duration of at least 6 months 
were 89% of patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 94% in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group.
Median 
treatment 
duration 
was 
131·0 
days 
(IQR 
44·0–253·0) 
in 
the 
pembrolizumab 
plus 
lenalidomide and dexa­methasone group and 162·0 days 
(83·0–246·0) in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group (appendix 1 p 19). At analysis, patients had 
received a median of 5·0 cycles (IQR 2·0–9·0) of 
treatment in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group and 6·0 cycles (3·0–9·0) in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group.
Adverse events of any grade occurred in similar 
proportions of patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (140 [94%] 
of 149) and the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group 
(133 [92%] of 145; table 2). Grade 3–5 adverse events 
(107 [72%] in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group vs 73 [50%] in the lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone group) and serious adverse events 
(81 [54%] vs 57 [39%]) occurred more frequently in the 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group than in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group. Adverse events led to death in 13 (9%) patients in 
the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexa­
methasone group versus eight (6%) patients in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and to discon­
tinuation in 44 (30%) versus 20 (14%); treatment-related 
adverse events led to discontinuation in 31 (21%) versus 
12 (8%) patients; adverse events resulting in treatment 
interruption occurred in 91 (61%) versus 61 (42%) 
patients. Adverse events that occurred more frequently 
in 
the 
pembro­lizumab 
plus 
lenalidomide 
and 
dexamethasone group than in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group (≥5% difference) and serious 
adverse events in at least 3% of patients are in appendix 1 
(pp 20, 21). No grade 3–5 events or serious adverse 
events occurred with at least a 5% difference in incidence 
between groups. Immune-mediated adverse events 
occurred in 48 (32%) of 149 patients in the 
Pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group (n=149)

pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group; rash (13 [9%]), hypothyroidism (11 [7%]), and 
hyperthyroidism (nine [6%]) were the most common 
(table 3). The minimum median time to onset of 
immune-mediated adverse events was 14 days. Only 
two patients had immune-mediated neutropenia and 
one patient had immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.
19 [13%] of 149 patients died in the pembrolizumab 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (six because 
of disease progression and 13 because of adverse events), 
and nine [6%] of 145 patients died in the lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone group (one because of disease 
progression and eight because of adverse events). Six 
(4%) 
treatment-related 
deaths 
occurred 
in 
the 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group (table 4). Of these deaths, cardiac arrest, cardiac 
failure, myocarditis, and pneumonia were considered by 
the investigator to be related to pembrolizumab (table 4). 
Two (1%) treatment-related deaths occurred in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group.
Patients in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group who died were older than those in 
the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (18 [95%] of 
19 in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group vs seven [78%] of nine in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group were aged 
≥70 years; eight [42%] of 19 vs three [33%] of nine were 
aged ≥80 years) and had high-risk cytogenetics (four [21%] 
of 19 vs none; appendix 1 p 22). A similar trend in age and 
high-risk cytogenetics was observed among patients who 
died because of an adverse event (appendix 1 p 23). The 
clinical courses of patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group who died 
because of adverse events are in appendix 1 (pp 24–38).
To assess higher risk for death in the pembrolizumab 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group, a retro­
spective, random forest analysis was done, followed by a 
multivariable Cox regression analysis; however, this did 
not lead to conclusive results because of the small 
number of deaths (28 [14%] of the predefined 195 deaths 
required) at analysis.
Discussion
Results of this non-protocol-specified analysis, with a 
median follow-up of 6·6 months (IQR 3·4–9·6), showed 
an increased risk for death with pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide 
and dexa­methasone alone. Because of the imbalance in

the proportion of death between groups, the data 
monitoring committee halted enrolment; this was 
followed by FDA termination of the study on July 3, 2017. 
Consequently, data collection was incomplete and the 
efficacy analysis was underpowered. 19% of the protocol-
specified 227 events required for analysis of progression-
free survival and 14% of the protocol-specified 195 events 
necessary for analysis of overall survival occurred by the 
time of analysis. Median progression-free survival 
(primary endpoint) and median overall survival were not 
reached in either group. Proportions of patients with a 
response were similar between groups. Treatment 
exposure was truncated, with patients in either group 
receiving a median of six treatment cycles at analysis; 
47 [32%] of 149 patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 36 [25%] of 
145 patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group received fewer than three cycles of treatment. 
Although 
overlapping 
Kaplan-Meier 
curves 
for 
progression-free survival or overall survival in this 
unplanned interim analysis suggested similar pro­
gression-free or overall survival between groups, this 
interpretation is limited by early study termination. 
Cancer severity is associated with immune system 
dysfunction; therefore, it is possible that, because of the 
degree of immunodeficiency associated with multiple 
myeloma, these patients might not have had an optimal 
response to treatment with a PD-1 inhibitor.19,20 Evidence 
of efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with multiple 
myeloma is increasing; however, patients continue to 
relapse, which can partly be a consequence of immune 
blockade.21 Early intervention might be particularly 
relevant for patients with multiple myeloma treated with 
immune-based therapies.
 The frequencies of grade 3–5 adverse events and 
serious adverse events were higher in the pembrolizumab 
plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone group than the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. More patients 
discontinued because of adverse events in the 
pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group than in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group. The immune-mediated adverse event profile was 
consistent 
with 
that 
previously 
reported 
for 
pembrolizumab in other cancers22–24 and with those 
observed with pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed, refractory 
multiple myeloma in the KEYNOTE-183 study25 and the 
study by Badros and colleagues.14 The most common 
immune-mediated 
adverse 
events 
were 
rash, 
hypothyroidism, and hyper­thyroidism. 34 (23%) patients 
had grade 3–5 immune-mediated adverse events, with 
rash most commonly reported. One patient died because 
of an immune-mediated adverse event (myocarditis).
Safety profiles of standard of care therapies have 
included similar percentages of grade 3–5 adverse 
events. In the ALCYONE study, patients who received 
bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone alone versus 
with daratumumab had similar percentages of grade 3 
or 4 neutropenia (137 [39%] of 354 vs 138 [40%] of 346), 
thrombocytopenia (133 [38%] vs 119 [34%]), anaemia (70 
[20%] vs 55 [16%]), and infections (52 [15%] vs 80 [23%]).7 
Patients in the SWOG S0777 study who received 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone versus with 
bortezomib also had similar percentages of grade 3 or 4 
blood adverse events (70% vs 73%) or bone marrow 
adverse events (34% vs 41%), grade 3 infections 
(29% vs 29%), and grade 3 neurological adverse events 
(21% vs 76%).26 Notably, in our study, more patients died 
in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexa­
metha­sone group than in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group. More deaths occurred because 
of disease progression in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group than in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. Additionally, 
number of deaths attributed to adverse events was 
numerically different between groups; however, no 
specific adverse event was exacerbated in patients who 
received 
pembro­lizumab 
plus 
lenalidomide 
and 
dexamethasone. Age and unfavourable risk factors might 
have contributed to increased toxicity and early (3-month) 
mortality of 8% of patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group and 5% in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group. These early 
mortality results are higher than the 4-month mortality 
results reported in a previous study for patients with 
myeloma who were treated with lenalidomide 25 mg on 
days 1–21 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1–4, 9–12, 
and 17–20 of a 28-day cycle (high dose, 5% mortality) or 
lenalidomide on the same schedule and dexamethasone 
40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 28-day cycle (low dose, 
<1% mortality).27 The authors noted that the increased 
percentage of deaths in the high-dose cohort, especially 
in the first 4 months, might have been related to toxicity 
in older patients.27 In our study, the starting dose of 
dexamethasone was reduced to 20 mg for 156 patients 
who were older than 75 years. Although the lenalidomide 
25 mg dose was established in the dose-confirmation 
phase of the KEYNOTE-023 study,13 reducing the dose to 
15 mg in older patients should be considered, based on 
the increased frequency of adverse events observed in 
this study.
To understand the imbalance of proportion of deaths 
between groups, baseline characteristics were assessed 
among patients who died during the study. More patients 
who died in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group than in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group were aged at least 70 years (95% in 
the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group vs 78% in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone 
group) and had high cytogenetic risk (21% vs 0). 
Furthermore, among all study patients, there was an 
imbalance of disease severity and manifestation at 
baseline, whereby patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group had more

advanced disease than those in the lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group (29% had stage III disease vs 21% in 
the lenalidomide and dexamethasone group; 14% vs 8% 
had renal impairment). According to the International 
Myeloma Working Group recommendations, cytogenetic 
abnormalities by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation, ISS 
stage, and renal failure are some of the factors used for risk 
stratification in patients with newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma.28 It is plausible that the imbalance between 
groups of risk factors such as ISS stage III and high 
cytogenetic risk, which are associated with poor prognosis,28 
contributed to the incidence of early progression and 
subsequent death. These risk factors might have led to the 
observed differences in treatment-related adverse events 
and deaths in this study. These results suggest that the 
observed imbalance in proportion of deaths between 
groups might have resulted from diverse non-treatment-
related adverse events or differ­ences in patient baseline 
characteristics. This study was limited by the ad-hoc 
unplanned nature of the analysis. Enrolment was ongoing 
at more than 100 international sites at the time the trial 
was prematurely terminated. Subsequent longer-term 
follow-up efficacy data were not collected, probably leading 
to imbalances in the reported results.
In conclusion, an imbalance was observed between 
groups in the number of deaths. However, the shortened 
follow-up time resulting from premature study term­
ination rendered this interim analysis underpowered 
and inconclusive. Future study designs testing PD-1 
inhibitors with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in 
multiple myeloma should consider excluding unfit 
patients, patients older than 75 years, and patients with 
high tumour burden or tumour staging. Other treatment 
combinations should also be assessed and excluding 
dexamethasone might reduce toxicity and improve 
T-cell activation. Stratification of patients by renal 
function and ECOG performance status could also be 
considered in future study designs.
