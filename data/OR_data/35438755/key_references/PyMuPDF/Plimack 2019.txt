BACKGROUND
The combination of pembrolizumab and axitinib showed antitumor activity in a phase 
1b trial involving patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma. 
Whether pembrolizumab plus axitinib would result in better outcomes than sunitinib 
in such patients was unclear.
METHODS
In an open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 861 patients with previously 
untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma to receive pembrolizumab (200 mg) 
intravenously once every 3 weeks plus axitinib (5 mg) orally twice daily (432 patients) 
or sunitinib (50 mg) orally once daily for the first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle (429 
patients). The primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival in 
the intention-to-treat population. The key secondary end point was the objective re-
sponse rate. All reported results are from the protocol-specified first interim analysis.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 12.8 months, the estimated percentage of patients who 
were alive at 12 months was 89.9% in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 78.3% 
in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 
to 0.74; P<0.0001). Median progression-free survival was 15.1 months in the pembro-
lizumab–axitinib group and 11.1 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio for 
disease progression or death, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84; P<0.001). The objective re-
sponse rate was 59.3% (95% CI, 54.5 to 63.9) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group 
and 35.7% (95% CI, 31.1 to 40.4) in the sunitinib group (P<0.001). The benefit of 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib was observed across the International Metastatic Renal 
Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk groups (i.e., favorable, intermediate, and 
poor risk) and regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression. Grade 3 or 
higher adverse events of any cause occurred in 75.8% of patients in the pembroli-
zumab–axitinib group and in 70.6% in the sunitinib group.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients with previously untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treatment 
with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted in significantly longer overall survival and 
progression-free survival, as well as a higher objective response rate, than treatment 
with sunitinib. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme; KEYNOTE-426 ClinicalTrials.gov

enal-cell carcinoma is character-
ized by susceptibility to both immuno-
therapeutic and antiangiogenic treatment 
approaches and resistance to cytotoxic chemo-
therapy.1 Agents such as sunitinib that target the 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) path-
way are standard first-line therapy for advanced 
disease.2-7 Despite the approval of several tar-
geted therapies by entities such as the Food and 
Drug Administration, the European Medicines 
Agency, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical 
Devices Agency, the survival rate among patients 
with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma has pla-
teaued.8,9
Both the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibi-
tor axitinib and the anti–programmed death 1 
(PD-1) monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab have 
shown antitumor activity in patients with previ-
ously untreated advanced clear-cell renal-cell 
carcinoma.6,10 In a phase 1b trial involving pa-
tients with previously untreated metastatic renal-
cell carcinoma, 73% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 59 to 84) of the patients who received 
pembrolizumab plus axitinib had a response; 
65% of patients had at least one treatment-related 
adverse event.11 We conducted the KEYNOTE-426 
trial to determine whether pembrolizumab plus 
axitinib would result in better outcomes than 
sunitinib in patients with previously untreated 
advanced renal-cell carcinoma.
Methods
Patients
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older; 
had newly diagnosed or recurrent stage IV (ac-
cording to the American Joint Commission on 
Cancer, seventh edition, classification) clear-cell 
renal-cell carcinoma; had received no previous 
systemic therapy for advanced disease; had a 
Karnofsky performance-status score of 70 or 
more (on a scale from 0 to 100, with lower 
scores indicating greater disability)12; had at 
least one measurable lesion as evaluated accord-
ing to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tu-
mors (RECIST), version 1.113; and had an avail-
able tumor sample for biomarker assessment. 
Patients were excluded if they had symptomatic 
central nervous system metastases, active auto-
immune disease, or poorly controlled hyperten-
sion (systolic blood pressure ≥150 mm Hg or 
diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg), if they 
had had an ischemic cardiovascular event or 
New York Heart Association class III or IV con-
gestive heart failure within 1 year before screen-
ing, or if they were receiving systemic immuno-
suppressive treatment. Full eligibility criteria are 
listed in section 5.1 in the trial protocol, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatments
In this open-label, phase 3 trial, patients were 
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive pem-
brolizumab (Keytruda, Merck Sharp & Dohme) 
plus axitinib (Inlyta, Pfizer) or sunitinib (Sutent, 
Pfizer). Randomization was stratified according 
to International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma 
Database Consortium (IMDC) risk group (favor-
able, intermediate, or poor risk) and geographic 
region (North America, Western Europe, or the 
rest of the world). Favorable risk corresponds to 
an IMDC score of 0, intermediate risk to a score 
of 1 or 2, and poor risk to a score of 3 to 6.14 
IMDC risk score is determined by the total num-
ber of the following six risk factors that are 
present: Karnofsky performance-status score of 
less than 80, time from initial diagnosis to ran-
domization of less than 1 year, hemoglobin level 
below the lower limit of the normal range, cor-
rected serum calcium level above the upper 
limit of the normal range, absolute neutrophil 
count above the upper limit of the normal range, 
and platelet count above the upper limit of the 
normal range.14
Pembrolizumab was administered intravenous-
ly at a dose of 200 mg once every 3 weeks. Axiti­
nib was administered orally at a dose of 5 mg 
twice daily; the dose could be increased to 7 mg, 
then 10 mg, twice daily if safety criteria were 
met and reduced to 3 mg, then 2 mg, twice 
daily to manage toxic effects. Sunitinib was ad-
ministered orally at a dose of 50 mg daily for the 
first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle; the dose 
could be reduced to 37.5 mg, then 25 mg, for the 
first 4 weeks of each 6-week cycle to manage 
toxic effects. Treatment was continued until dis-
ease progression, development of unacceptable 
toxic effects, or physician or patient decision to 
discontinue. Pembrolizumab was administered 
for a maximum of 35 cycles. Patients who had a 
confirmed complete response could discontinue 
treatment. Patients with unconfirmed disease 
progression who were in clinically stable condi-
tion could continue to receive treatment at the

discretion of the investigator until progression 
was confirmed by means of subsequent imaging 
performed at least 28 days after radiographic 
progression was first observed; patients could be 
treated beyond confirmed progression if pre-
specified criteria were met. If one drug in the 
pembrolizumab–axitinib group was discontinued 
because of toxic effects, the other drug could be 
continued. Full guidelines regarding treatment 
decisions and management of adverse events are 
provided in section 5.2 in the protocol.
End Points and Assessments
The dual primary end points were overall sur-
vival and progression-free survival according to 
RECIST, version 1.1, as determined by blinded, 
independent central review. The key secondary 
end point was the objective response rate accord-
ing to RECIST, version 1.1, as determined by 
blinded, independent central review. Other sec-
ondary end points included duration of response 
and safety. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-
to-treat population, which included all patients 
who underwent randomization. Safety was as-
sessed in the as-treated population, which includ­
ed all randomly assigned patients who received 
one or more doses of trial treatment.
Data on adverse events and laboratory abnor-
malities were collected regularly throughout the 
treatment period and for 30 days thereafter (data 
on serious adverse events and events of interest 
were collected for 90 days after the end of the 
treatment period) and were graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Termi-
nology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. 
Tumor imaging was performed at baseline and 
week 12 and then every 6 weeks through week 
54 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Bone scans 
were required at baseline. If the baseline bone 
scan was positive, additional scans were per-
formed at week 18 and then every 12 weeks 
through week 54 and every 24 weeks thereafter. 
Response was assessed according to RECIST, 
version 1.1.13 Patients were contacted for assess-
ment of survival every 12 weeks during follow-up. 
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression 
in archival or newly obtained, formalin-fixed tu-
mor samples was assessed at a central laboratory 
with the use of the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx 
assay (Agilent Technologies) and was character-
ized according to the combined positive score, 
which was calculated as the number of PD-L1–
positive cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, and 
macrophages) divided by the total number of 
tumor cells, multiplied by 100.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by academic advisors and 
employees of the sponsor. An independent data 
and safety monitoring committee oversaw the 
trial, periodically assessed safety, and assessed 
efficacy at the prespecified interim analysis. The 
trial protocol and all amendments were approved 
by the appropriate ethics body at each center. All 
patients provided written informed consent be-
fore enrollment.
The trial was conducted in accordance with 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All the authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and for the fidelity of the trial to the proto-
col and attest that they had access to the data 
and that they participated in writing or review-
ing and editing drafts of the manuscript. As part 
of the site agreement, investigators agreed to 
keep all aspects of the trial, including the data, 
confidential. Assistance with the preparation of 
the manuscript was provided by a medical writer 
employed by the sponsor.
Statistical Analysis
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate 
overall survival, progression-free survival, and 
duration of response. The stratified log-rank test 
was used to assess between-group differences in 
overall survival and progression-free survival. A 
stratified Cox proportional-hazards model and 
Efron’s method of handling ties were used to 
assess the magnitude of the treatment differ-
ence. The stratified method of Miettinen and 
Nurminen with weights proportional to the 
stratum size was used to assess the difference 
in response rate. The stratification factors used 
at randomization were applied to all stratified 
analyses.
The full statistical analysis plan is available in 
section 8.0 in the protocol. The graphical meth-
od of Maurer and Bretz was used to control the 
family-wise type I error rate at a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.025 across all hypotheses and interim 
analyses. We estimated that with enrollment of 
861 patients, the trial would have 99% power to 
detect a hazard ratio for disease progression or 
death of 0.60 for the comparison of pembroliz­
umab plus axitinib with sunitinib, at a one-sided

alpha level of 0.002, assuming 487 instances of 
disease progression or death and one interim 
analysis (performed after approximately 75% of 
the target number of events had occurred) and 
80% power to detect a hazard ratio for death of 
0.75, at a one-sided alpha level of 0.023, assum-
ing 404 deaths and two interim analyses (per-
formed after approximately 48% of the target 
number of deaths had occurred for the first in-
terim analysis and 74% of the target number of 
deaths had occurred for the second interim 
analysis). The first interim analysis was to be 
performed at least 7 months after the last pa-
tient underwent randomization and after at least 
305 instances of disease progression or death 
had been observed; it was estimated that ap-
proximately 195 deaths would be observed at 
this time. At the cutoff date for the first interim 
analysis (August 24, 2018), a total of 395 patients 
had disease progression or had died, and 156 
deaths had occurred; the one-sided P value 
thresholds for declaring the superiority of pem-
brolizumab plus axitinib over sunitinib were 
0.0001 for overall survival and 0.0013 for pro-
gression-free survival; if the overall and progres-
sion-free survival thresholds were met, response 
rate could be tested at a one-sided alpha level of 
0.025. All data reported here are based on the 
first interim analysis.
Results
Patients and Treatments
A total of 1062 patients at 129 sites in 16 coun-
tries were screened for eligibility; of these, 861 
patients at 124 sites underwent randomization 
from October 24, 2016, to January 24, 2018. A 
total of 432 patients were assigned to the pem-
brolizumab–axitinib group, and 429 patients 
were assigned to the sunitinib group (Fig. S1 in 
the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM 
.org). Baseline demographics and disease char-
acteristics were as expected for a trial involving 
patients with advanced renal-cell carcinoma and 
were balanced between the groups (Table 1). The 
IMDC risk category was favorable for 31.2% of 
patients, intermediate for 56.2%, and poor for 
12.5%. Among the 822 patients with tumor 
samples that could be evaluated for PD-L1 ex-
pression, 60.5% had a combined positive score 
of 1 or more.
A total of 429 patients in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group and 425 patients in the sunitinib 
group received at least one dose of the assigned 
treatment. The median duration of any treatment 
was 10.4 months (range, 0.03 to 21.2) in the 
pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 7.8 months 
(range, 0.07 to 20.5) in the sunitinib group. In 
the pembrolizumab–axitinib group, the median 
duration of treatment was 8.3 months with pem-
brolizumab and axitinib, 9.2 months with pembro-
lizumab, and 9.6 months with axitinib. The 
median daily dose of axitinib was 9.8 mg, and 
the median daily dose of sunitinib was 50.0 mg. 
Median follow-up (defined as the time from 
randomization to death or the date of data cut-
off for those who were alive) was 12.8 months 
(range, 0.1 to 22.0) in the intention-to-treat 
population. In the as-treated population, 253 of 
the 429 patients (59.0%) in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group and 183 of the 425 patients 
(43.1%) in the sunitinib group were still receiv-
ing the trial treatment. The most common rea-
son for treatment discontinuation was disease 
progression (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). In the pembrolizumab–axitinib group, 
88 patients (50.0% of the 176 patients who dis-
continued pembrolizumab plus axitinib) received 
subsequent anticancer therapy, most commonly 
a VEGF or VEGF receptor inhibitor (44.3%). In 
the sunitinib group, 147 patients (60.7% of the 
242 patients who discontinued sunitinib) received 
subsequent anticancer therapy, most commonly 
a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor (37.6%) (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy
The estimated percentage of patients who were 
alive at 12 months was 89.9% (95% CI, 86.4 to 
92.4) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 
78.3% (95% CI, 73.8 to 82.1) in the sunitinib 
group. The corresponding estimates for 18 months 
were 82.3% (95% CI, 77.2 to 86.3) and 72.1% 
(95% CI, 66.3 to 77.0) (Fig.  1A). The median 
survival was not reached in either group. The 
risk of death was 47% lower in the pembroliz­
umab–axitinib group than in the sunitinib group 
(hazard ratio for death, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.38 to 
0.74; P<0.0001). The median progression-free 
survival was 15.1 months (95% CI, 12.6 to 17.7) 
in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 11.1 
months (95% CI, 8.7 to 12.5) in the sunitinib 
group (Fig. 2A). The hazard ratio for disease pro-
gression or death was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.57 to 0.84;

Pembrolizumab + Axitinib for Renal-Cell Carcinoma
(range, 1.4+ to 18.2+ months), and the median 
duration of response was 15.2 months (range, 
1.1+ to 15.4+) in the sunitinib group (with plus 
signs in the ranges indicating an ongoing re-
sponse at the time of data cutoff). The estimated 
percentage of patients with an ongoing response 
at 1 year was 70.6% in the pembrolizumab–­
axitinib group and 61.6% in the sunitinib group 
(Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety
Adverse events of any cause occurred in 98.4% of 
the 429 patients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib 
group who received the assigned treatment and 
in 99.5% of the 425 patients in the sunitinib group 
who received the assigned treatment. These events 
were of grade 3 or higher in 75.8% of the pa-
tients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and 
in 70.6% of the patients in the sunitinib group; 
62.9% of the patients in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group and 58.1% of the patients in the 
sunitinib group had events of grade 3 or higher 
that were attributed by the investigator to trial 
treatment. In the pembrolizumab–axitinib group, 
adverse events of any cause led to discontinua-
tion of either drug in 30.5% of patients, discon-
tinuation of both drugs in 10.7%, interruption 
of either drug in 69.9%, and dose reduction of 
axitinib in 20.3%. The median time to discontinu-
ation of both pembrolizumab and axitinib because 
of adverse events of any cause was 105.5 days, and 
the median time to discontinuation of pembro-
lizumab because of adverse events of any cause 
was 65 days. In the sunitinib group, adverse events 
of any cause led to discontinuation in 13.9% of 
patients, interruption in 49.9%, and dose reduc-
tion in 30.1%. A summary of treatment-related 
adverse events is provided in Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. Of the 11 patients 
(2.6%) in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group 
who died from adverse events, 4 (0.9%) died 
from treatment-related adverse events (from my-
asthenia gravis, myocarditis, necrotizing fasciitis, 
and pneumonitis, in 1 patient each). Among the 
15 patients (3.5%) in the sunitinib group who 
died from adverse events, 7 patients (1.6%) died 
from treatment-related adverse events (from acute 
myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, fulminant 
hepatitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intracra-
nial hemorrhage, malignant neoplasm progres-
sion, and pneumonia, in 1 patient each).
In both groups, the most common adverse 
events of any cause and the most common ad-
verse events related to treatment were diarrhea 
and hypertension (Table 3, and Table S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The between-group 
difference in the risk of adverse events of grade 3 
or higher that occurred in at least 10% of pa-
tients is provided in Figure S3 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher 
that occurred in 10% or more of patients were 
hypertension and increased alanine aminotrans-
ferase levels in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group 
and hypertension in the sunitinib group.
Adverse events of interest, which were deter-
mined on the basis of a list of terms specified by 
the sponsor and were considered regardless of 
whether the investigator determined that they 
were related to treatment, occurred in 51.3% of 
patients in the pembrolizumab–axitinib group 
and in 36.2% of patients in the sunitinib group 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Grade 3 events occurred in 8.4% of patients in 
the pembrolizumab–axitinib group and in 1.6% 
in the sunitinib group, grade 4 events occurred 
in 1.6% and 0%, respectively, and grade 5 events 
occurred in 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively.
Discussion
The results of this randomized, phase 3 trial of 
patients with previously untreated advanced renal-
cell carcinoma showed that treatment with pem-
brolizumab plus axitinib resulted in a 47% lower 
risk of death and a 31% lower risk of disease

to-Treat Population.
Panel A shows the Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall 
survival. Tick marks in Panel A represent data censored 
at the last time the patient was known to be alive. Panel 
B shows the analysis of overall survival in subgroups. 
Analyses were performed with the use of a Cox regres-
sion model, with treatment used as a covariate, strati-
fied according to International Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk category 
and geographic region. Karnofsky performance-status 
scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicat-
ing greater disability.12 The programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) combined positive score was calculated as the 
number of PD-L1–positive cells (tumor cells, lympho-
cytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number 
of tumor cells, multiplied by 100; patients with PD-L1 
expression that could not be evaluated were excluded 
from the analysis of the subgroup defined according to 
PD-L1 combined positive score.

progression or death than treatment with suni-
tinib. The objective response rate was 23.6 per-
centage points higher in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group than in the sunitinib group. 
Although subgroup analyses should be consid-
ered hypothesis-generating only, it is notable 
that the benefit of pembrolizumab plus axitinib 
was observed across all subgroups tested, includ-
ing in all IMDC risk groups and both in patients 
who had tumors with PD-L1 expression and 
those who had tumors without PD-L1 expression. 
These data build on the single-agent activity of 
pembrolizumab and axitinib.6,10 The significant 
overall survival advantage is particularly notable 
because it has not been achieved with first-line 
treatment of renal-cell carcinoma with the use of 
anti–VEGF-based therapy administered alone or 
in combination.2-7,15
Results of other trials have also suggested 
that combination therapy with a checkpoint-
inhibitor backbone has anticancer activity as first-
line therapy in patients with advanced renal-cell 
carcinoma. Among patients who had intermedi-
ate or poor risk according to the IMDC criteria,

Pembrolizumab + Axitinib for Renal-Cell Carcinoma
a combination of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab 
and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated pro-
tein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab resulted in longer 
overall survival and a higher objective response 
rate (the primary end points) than sunitinib; 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab also resulted in a 
complete response in 9% of patients.16 An ex-
ploratory analysis involving patients with favor-
able risk showed that sunitinib resulted in longer 
progression-free survival and a higher objective 
response rate than nivolumab plus ipilimumab. 
The combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab 
and axitinib resulted in longer progression-free 
survival and a higher objective response rate than 
sunitinib among patients with previously untreat-
ed PD-L1–positive disease.17 Additional follow-up 
is required to determine whether avelumab plus 
axitinib will improve overall survival. The com-
bination of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab 
with the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevaciz­
umab resulted in longer progression-free survival 
and fewer grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse 
events than sunitinib among patients with previ-
ously untreated PD-L1–positive disease.18
The observed safety profiles of pembrolizu­
mab plus axitinib and of sunitinib were as ex-
pected on the basis of the known profiles of these 
three drugs, although the incidence of grade 3 
or 4 elevations in liver-enzyme levels in the pem-
brolizumab–axitinib group was higher than pre-
viously observed when each agent was used as 
monotherapy.19,20 There were no deaths related to 
hepatic adverse events in the pembrolizumab–
axitinib group. Further characterization of he-
patic adverse events in this trial is ongoing. Dis-
continuation of any treatment because of adverse 
events occurred more frequently in the pembro-
lizumab–axitinib group than in the sunitinib 
group. The incidence and severity of adverse 
events of interest were as expected on the basis 
of previous experience with pembrolizumab mono-
therapy.10,19 The exception is a greater incidence 
of hyperthyroidism and of hypothyroidism, which 
was not unexpected given that thyroid abnor-
malities are also a known side effect of axitinib.20
A limitation of our trial was the short dura-
tion of follow-up. Because of this, the number 
of deaths that accrued in certain subgroups was 
small, which led to large confidence intervals 
around the point estimates. The short duration of 
follow-up may also mean that responses, includ-
ing complete responses, are still evolving. No 
further alpha-controlled efficacy testing will be 
performed because the protocol-specified criteria 
for declaring a significant benefit of pembrolizu­
mab plus axitinib as compared with sunitinib 
were met. However, patients will continue to be 
followed for assessment of efficacy and safety.
In conclusion, the results of the KEYNOTE-426 
trial showed that among patients with previously 
untreated advanced renal-cell carcinoma, treat-
ment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib resulted 
in significantly longer overall survival and pro-
gression-free survival and a significantly higher 
objective response rate than sunitinib alone. The 
hepatic toxic effects of pembrolizumab plus 
axitinib require further examination, but the 
overall frequency of toxic effects was similar in 
the two groups. The benefit of pembrolizumab 
plus axitinib was observed across all IMDC prog-
nostic risk categories and in both PD-L1 expres-
sion subgroups.
