BACKGROUND
Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 
(PD-1) that has antitumor activity in advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 
with increased activity in tumors that express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).
METHODS
In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 305 patients who had previ-
ously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells 
and no sensitizing mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or trans-
location of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene to receive either pembrolizumab (at 
a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks) or the investigator’s choice of platinum-based 
chemotherapy. Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group 
was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progres-
sion-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic 
review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.
RESULTS
Median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 
to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) 
in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% 
CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 
80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard 
ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P = 0.005). The response rate was higher in 
the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the 
median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months] 
vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any 
grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 
4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, 
pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall 
survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
A 
pproximately 23 to 28% of patients 
with advanced non–small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) have a high level of programmed 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, which is de-
fined as membranous PD-L1 expression on at 
least 50% of tumor cells, regardless of the stain-
ing intensity (i.e., a PD-L1 tumor proportion score 
of 50% or greater).1,2 Data from the phase 1 
KEYNOTE-001 and phase 3 KEYNOTE-010 stud-
ies indicated that patients with advanced NSCLC 
and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or 
greater were more likely than those with lower 
tumor proportion scores to have a response to 
pembrolizumab, a highly selective, humanized 
monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 
(PD-1) that prevents PD-1 from engaging PD-L1 
and PD-L2.1-3
Current first-line treatment decisions for ad-
vanced NSCLC are based on the presence of ge-
netic aberrations, such as sensitizing mutations 
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and 
translocations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK). However, most patients with NSCLC do 
not harbor these oncogenic drivers, and for these 
patients, treatment options are limited to cyto-
toxic chemotherapy. In patients enrolled in the 
KEYNOTE-001 trial who had previously untreated 
NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 
50% or greater, pembrolizumab (administered 
every 2 or 3 weeks at a dose of 10 mg per kilo-
gram of body weight) was associated with a re-
sponse rate of 58.3%, median progression-free 
survival of 12.5 months, and 24-month overall 
survival of 60.6%.4
In the international, randomized, open-label, 
phase 3 KEYNOTE-024 trial, we compared 
pembrolizumab (administered at a fixed dose of 
200 mg every 3 weeks) with the investigator’s 
choice of cytotoxic chemotherapy as first-line 
therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC and a 
PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater.
Methods
Patients
Patients 18 years of age or older were eligible for 
enrollment if they had histologically or cytologi-
cally confirmed stage IV NSCLC with no sensi-
tizing EGFR mutations or ALK translocations, had 
undergone no previous systemic therapy for 
metastatic disease, and had an Eastern Coopera-
tive Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-status 
score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with 0 indi-
cating no symptoms and higher scores indicating 
increasing disability), at least one measurable 
lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1,5 a life 
expectancy of at least 3 months, and a PD-L1 
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater. Patients 
were ineligible if they were receiving systemic 
glucocorticoids (excluding daily glucocorticoid-
replacement therapy for conditions such as adre-
nal or pituitary insufficiency) or other immuno-
suppressive treatment or if they had untreated 
brain metastases, active autoimmune disease for 
which they had received systemic treatment dur-
ing the previous 2 years, active interstitial lung 
disease, or a history of pneumonitis for which 
they had received glucocorticoids.
Trial Design and Treatment
Patients were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 
to receive treatment with either pembrolizumab 
(administered intravenously at a dose of 200 mg 
every 3 weeks) for 35 cycles or the investigator’s 
choice of one of the following five platinum-
based chemotherapy regimens for 4 to 6 cycles: 
carboplatin plus pemetrexed, cisplatin plus peme-
trexed, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin 
plus gemcitabine, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). 
Chemotherapy regimens that included peme-
trexed were permitted only for patients who had 
nonsquamous tumors; these patients could con-
tinue to receive pemetrexed as maintenance ther-
apy after the completion of combination chemo-
therapy. The intended chemotherapy regimen, 
including the use of pemetrexed maintenance 
therapy, was chosen before the patient under-
went randomization. Randomization was strati-
fied by ECOG performance-status score (0 vs. 1), 
tumor histologic type (squamous vs. nonsqua-
mous), and region of enrollment (East Asia vs. 
non–East Asia) and did not include any provi-
sions regarding equal distribution of enrollment 
across participating sites or stratification by site. 
Treatment was continued for the specified num-
ber of cycles or until the patient had radiologic 
disease progression (defined according to RECIST; 
Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix), had 
treatment-related adverse events of unacceptable 
severity, or withdrew consent or until the inves-
tigator decided to withdraw the patient, which-

Pembrolizumab vs. Chemotherapy for PD-L1–Positive Lung Cancer
ever occurred first. Patients in the chemotherapy 
group who had disease progression, which was 
verified by means of blinded, independent, cen-
tral radiologic review, could cross over to receive 
pembrolizumab, if safety criteria were met. There 
was no preplanned crossover from the pembro-
lizumab group to the chemotherapy group, and 
there were no guidelines regarding therapy after 
disease progression for patients in the pembro-
lizumab group. Patients in either treatment group 
who were in clinically stable condition and were 
considered by the investigator to be deriving 
clinical benefit could continue therapy after dis-
ease progression. Full guidance on treatment 
decisions, including the management of adverse 
events, can be found in the trial protocol, avail-
able at NEJM.org.
Trial Assessments
PD-L1 expression was assessed in formalin-fixed 
tumor samples at a central laboratory with the 
use of the commercially available PD-L1 IHC 
22C3 pharmDx assay (Dako North America).6,7 
Tumor samples were obtained by core-needle or 
excisional biopsy or from tissue resected at the 
time the metastatic disease was diagnosed. Fine-
needle aspirates or samples obtained from irra-
diated sites or before the administration of adju-
vant or neoadjuvant therapy were not permitted 
to be used. Imaging studies of the tumors were 
obtained every 9 weeks, and the response to 
treatment was assessed according to RECIST by 
means of blinded, independent, central radiologic 
review. Adverse events were reviewed, a physical 
examination was performed, and vital signs, a 
complete blood count with a differential count, 
and a comprehensive blood panel were assessed 
every 3 weeks during treatment and at the time 
of treatment discontinuation; T3, free T4, and 
thyrotropin were assessed every 6 weeks. During 
the survival follow-up phase, patients were con-
tacted every 2 months for an assessment of sur-
vival. The full assessment schedule is available 
in the trial protocol. All adverse events and ab-
normalities were graded according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events, version 4.0.
End Points
The primary end point was progression-free sur-
vival, which was defined as the time from ran-
domization to disease progression or death from 
any cause. Secondary end points included overall 
survival, which was defined as the time from 
randomization to death from any cause; objec-
tive response rate, which was defined as the per-
centage of patients with a confirmed complete 
or partial response; and safety. An exploratory 
end point was duration of response, which was 
defined as the time from the first documenta-
tion of a complete or partial response to disease 
progression. A full list of end points is avail-
able in the protocol. Efficacy was assessed in 
the intention-to-treat population, which included 
all patients who underwent randomization. Safety 
was assessed in the as-treated population, which 
included all patients who received at least one 
dose of the assigned trial treatment.
Trial Oversight
The KEYNOTE-024 trial was designed by Merck 
representatives and academic advisors. Data were 
collected by investigators and associated site per-
sonnel, analyzed by statisticians employed by 
Merck, and interpreted by academic authors and 
Merck representatives. An external data and safety 
monitoring committee oversaw the trial and 
assessed the safety and efficacy at prespecified 
interim analyses. Committee members are listed 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
The trial protocol and all amendments were 
approved by the appropriate institutional review 
board or independent ethics committee at each 
trial center. The trial was conducted in accor-
dance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and 
the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All 
the patients provided written informed consent 
before enrollment.
All the authors had full access to the data, 
vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the 
data, and attest that the trial was conducted in 
accordance with the protocol and all amendments. 
The first draft of the manuscript was written by 
the first and last authors with input from authors 
employed by Merck. All the authors participated 
in reviewing and editing the manuscript, and 
approved the submitted draft. As part of the site 
agreement signed before trial participation, 
investigators agreed to keep all aspects of the 
trial, including the resultant data, confidential.

analysis of progression-free survival, data for pa-
tients who were alive and had no disease pro-
gression or who were lost to follow-up were 
censored at the time of the last tumor assess-
ment. For the analysis of overall survival, data 
for patients who were alive or who were lost to 
follow-up were censored at the time of the last 
contact. Between-group differences in progression-
free and overall survival were assessed with the 
use of a stratified log-rank test. Hazard ratios 
and associated 95% confidence intervals were 
assessed with the use of a stratified Cox propor-
tional-hazards model with Efron’s method of 
handling ties. The same stratification factors 
used for randomization were applied to the strati-
fied log-rank and Cox models. Differences in 
response rate were assessed with the use of the 
stratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen.
The overall type I error rate for this trial was 
strictly controlled at a one-sided alpha level of 
2.5%. The full statistical analysis plan is avail-
able in the protocol. The protocol specified two 
interim analyses before the final analysis. The 
first interim analysis was to be performed after 
the first 191 patients who underwent random-
ization had a minimum of 6 months of follow-
up; at this time, the objective response rate would 
be analyzed at an alpha level of 0.5%. The pri-
mary objective of the second interim analysis, 
which was to be performed after approximately 
175 events of progression or death had been 
observed, was to evaluate the superiority of pem-
brolizumab over chemotherapy with respect to 
progression-free survival, at a one-sided alpha 
level of 2.0%. If pembrolizumab was superior 
with respect to progression-free survival, the su-
periority of pembrolizumab over chemotherapy 
with respect to overall survival would be assessed 
by means of a group-sequential test with two 
analyses, to be performed after approximately 
110 and 170 deaths had been observed. We cal-
culated that with approximately 175 events of 
progression or death, the trial would have 97% 
power to detect a hazard ratio for progression or 
death with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy 
of 0.55. At the time of the second interim analy-
sis, the trial had approximately 40% power to 
detect a hazard ratio for death with pembroli-
zumab versus chemotherapy of approximately 
0.65 at a one-sided alpha level of 1.18%.
The second interim analysis was performed 
after 189 events of progression or death and 108 
deaths had occurred and was based on a cutoff 
date of May 9, 2016. The data and safety moni-
toring committee reviewed the results on June 8, 
2016, and June 14, 2016. Because pembrolizu­
mab was superior to chemotherapy with respect 
to overall survival at the prespecified multiplicity-
adjusted, one-sided alpha level of 1.18%, the 
external data and safety monitoring committee 
recommended that the trial be stopped early to 
give the patients who were receiving chemo-
therapy the opportunity to receive pembrolizu­
mab. All data reported herein are based on the 
second interim analysis.
Results
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
A total of 1934 patients at 142 sites in 16 coun-
tries were screened for enrollment, including 
1729 who submitted samples for PD-L1 assess-
ment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Of the 1653 patients whose samples could be 
evaluated for PD-L1, 500 (30.2%) had a PD-L1 
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater. Be-
tween September 19, 2014, and October 29, 2015, 
a total of 305 patients at 102 sites who met inclu-
sion criteria were randomly assigned to either the 
pembrolizumab group (154 patients) or the che-
motherapy group (151 patients). In the chemo-
therapy group, the most common regimen was 
carboplatin plus pemetrexed (in 67 patients). All 
the patients in the pembrolizumab group re-
ceived the trial treatment. In the chemotherapy 
group, 1 patient withdrew consent before receiv-
ing the planned trial treatment, and 46 patients 
received pemetrexed maintenance therapy after 
completion of combination chemotherapy. The 
demographic characteristics of the patients and 
the disease characteristics at baseline were gen-
erally well balanced between treatment groups 
(Table 1), although more patients in the chemo-
therapy group than in the pembrolizumab group 
had never smoked (12.6% vs. 3.2%) and more 
patients in the pembrolizumab group than in 
the chemotherapy group had brain metastases 
(11.7% vs. 6.6%). These differences were not 
statistically significant.
As of May 9, 2016, the median duration of 
follow-up was 11.2 months (range, 6.3 to 19.7), 
and 48.1% of the patients in the pembrolizumab

Pembrolizumab vs. Chemotherapy for PD-L1–Positive Lung Cancer
group and 10.0% of the patients in the chemo-
therapy group were still receiving the assigned 
treatment (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). The median duration of treatment was 
7.0 months (range, 1 day to 18.7 months) in the 
pembrolizumab group and 3.5 months (range, 
1 day to 16.8 months) in the chemotherapy group. 
The median number of treatment cycles in the 
pembrolizumab group was 10.5 (range, 1 to 26); 
the median number in the chemotherapy group 
was 4 (range, 1 to 6), both for patients who had 
squamous tumors and for those who had non-
squamous tumors. In the chemotherapy group, 
66 patients (43.7%) crossed over to receive pem-
brolizumab after disease progression. Of the pa-
tients who crossed over, 57.6% were still receiv-
ing pembrolizumab at the time of data cutoff.
Progression-free Survival
In the intention-to-treat population, on the basis 
of 189 total events of progression or death, me-
dian progression-free survival was 10.3 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) 
in the pembrolizumab group and 6.0 months 
(95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group 
(Fig. 1A). The estimated percentage of patients 
who were alive and had no disease progression 
at 6 months was 62.1% (95% CI, 53.8 to 69.4) in 
the pembrolizumab group and 50.3% (95% CI, 
41.9 to 58.2) in the chemotherapy group. Pro-
gression-free survival was significantly longer in 
the pembrolizumab group than in the chemo-
therapy group (hazard ratio for disease progres-
sion or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68;

Pembrolizumab vs. Chemotherapy for PD-L1–Positive Lung Cancer
respect to progression-free survival was evident 
in all subgroups examined (Fig. 1B).
Overall Survival
At the time of the second interim analysis, 108 
deaths had occurred. The estimated percentage 
of patients who were alive at 6 months was 
80.2% (95% CI, 72.9 to 85.7) in the pembroli-
zumab group and 72.4% (95% CI, 64.5 to 78.9) 
in the chemotherapy group (Fig. 2); median over-
all survival was not reached in either group. 
Overall survival was significantly longer in the 
pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy 
group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 
to 0.89; P = 0.005).
Objective Response Rate
The objective response rate, assessed according 
to RECIST, was 44.8% (95% CI, 36.8 to 53.0) in 
the pembrolizumab group and 27.8% (95% CI, 
20.8 to 35.7) in the chemotherapy group (Table 2). 
The median time to response was 2.2 months in 
both groups. The median duration of response 
was not reached (range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months) 
in the pembrolizumab group and was 6.3 months 
(range, 2.1+ to 12.6+) in the chemotherapy 
group. (Plus signs in the ranges indicate the re-
sponse was ongoing at cutoff.)
Adverse Events
During treatment with the initially assigned ther-
apy, treatment-related adverse events occurred in 
73.4% of the patients in the pembrolizumab 
group and in 90.0% of the patients in the chemo-
therapy group (Table 3). Grade 3, 4, or 5 treat-
ment-related adverse events occurred in twice as 
many patients in the chemotherapy group as in 
the pembrolizumab group (53.3% vs. 26.6%). 
Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred 
in a similar percentage of patients in the pem-
brolizumab group and the chemotherapy group 
(21.4% and 20.7%, respectively). Discontinuation 
of treatment because of treatment-related adverse 
events occurred in 7.1% of patients in the pem-
brolizumab group and in 10.7% of patients in 
the chemotherapy group. Treatment-related ad-
verse events that led to death occurred in one 
patient in the pembrolizumab group (sudden 
death of unknown cause on day 2) and three 
patients in the chemotherapy group (one death 
due to pulmonary sepsis on day 25, one death 
due to pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage on day 
112, and one death of unknown cause on day 8).
The most common treatment-related adverse 
events were diarrhea (in 14.3% of the patients),

randomization. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance-status scores range from 0 to 5, 
with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher scores in­
dicating increasing disability. The subgroups for the 
platinum-based chemotherapy regimen are based on 
the regimen chosen before the patient was randomly 
assigned to treatment with either pembrolizumab or 
platinum-based chemotherapy.

fatigue (10.4%), and pyrexia (10.4%) in the pem-
brolizumab group and anemia (44.0%), nausea 
(43.3%), and fatigue (28.7%) in the chemother-
apy group (Table 3). Grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-
related adverse events that occurred in four or 
more patients were diarrhea (in 3.9% of the pa-
tients) and pneumonitis (2.6%) in the pembroli-
zumab group and anemia (19.3%), neutropenia 
(13.3%), decreased platelet count (6.0%), throm-
bocytopenia (5.3%), decreased neutrophil count 
(4.0%), fatigue (3.3%), and decreased appetite 
(2.7%) in the chemotherapy group. Although de-
creased neutrophil count and neutropenia may 
reflect the same condition, they were listed by 
the investigators as two distinct events; this is 
also the case for decreased platelet count and 
thrombocytopenia.
Immune-mediated adverse events, both those 
that were and those that were not attributed by 
the investigator to treatment, occurred in 29.2% 
of patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 
4.7% of patients in the chemotherapy group; 
grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated events occurred 
in 9.7% and 0.7% of patients, respectively (Ta-
ble 3). The only grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated 
events that occurred in two or more patients oc-
curred in the pembrolizumab group: severe skin 
reactions (in 3.9%), pneumonitis (2.6%), and 
colitis (1.3%). There were no grade 5 immune-
mediated events.
Discussion
The results of this randomized trial showed the 
superiority of anti–PD-1 therapy over platinum-
based combination chemotherapy as first-line 
treatment for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 ex-
pression on at least 50% of tumor cells and with 
no sensitizing EGFR mutations or ALK transloca-
tions. First-line treatment with pembrolizumab 
resulted in significantly longer progression-free 
and overall survival than did standard chemo-
therapy, which included the use of pemetrexed 
maintenance therapy for patients with nonsqua-
mous tumors. The magnitude of benefit observed 
in the chemotherapy group is consistent with 
that previously observed with platinum-based 
combination regimens and pemetrexed mainte-
nance therapy.8-10 The longer progression-free 
survival with pembrolizumab than with chemo-
therapy was observed across all subgroups ana-
lyzed and thus appeared to occur independently 
of patient age, sex, ECOG performance-status 
score, tumor histologic type, region of enroll-
ment, presence or absence of brain metastases at 
baseline, chemotherapy regimen administered, 
and smoking status, although the low number of 
patients who had never smoked (24 patients) 
precludes accurate interpretation of the benefit 
in this population. The benefit of pembrolizu­
mab observed in patients who had squamous 
tumors is notable, given the limited treatment 
options available for these patients. Pembrolizu­
mab was also associated with a higher objective 
response rate, a longer duration of response, and 
a lower frequency of treatment-related adverse 
events than was chemotherapy.
Pembrolizumab was associated with signifi-
cantly longer overall survival than was chemo-
therapy, despite the low number of deaths ob-
served and the potentially confounding effect of 
crossover from the chemotherapy group to the 
pembrolizumab group. On the basis of data 
from the second interim analysis, the data and 
safety monitoring committee recommended that

the trial be stopped and that patients remaining 
in the chemotherapy group be offered pembroli-
zumab. At the time of data cutoff, 35.4% of the 
enrolled patients had died and 43.7% of the pa-
tients in the chemotherapy group had crossed 
over to receive pembrolizumab. These data under-
score the substantial benefit of pembrolizumab 
as initial therapy for advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 
expression on at least 50% of tumor cells.
All the patients enrolled in this study had a 
PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater. 
The 50% cutoff was established on the basis of 
data from the KEYNOTE-001 trial that showed 
a significantly increased objective response rate 
in this population.2 The prevalence of a tu-
mor proportion score of 50% or greater in the 
KEYNOTE-024 screened population (30.2%) was 
consistent with the prevalence observed in the 
KEYNOTE-001 trial among previously untreated 
patients (24.9%) and in the KEYNOTE-010 trial 
among previously treated patients (28%).1,2 On-
going phase 3 studies, such as KEYNOTE-042 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02220894), will 
assess the benefit of pembrolizumab over chemo-
therapy in previously untreated patients who have 
a tumor proportion score of 1% or greater.
In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab 
was administered at a fixed dose. Pharmacoki-
netic modeling suggested that a 200-mg fixed 
dose of pembrolizumab would provide exposure 
similar to the weight-based dosing regimens 
used in previous studies of pembrolizumab.11 
The progression-free survival, overall survival, 
objective response rate, and duration of response 
observed in the pembrolizumab group in this 
trial are consistent with those observed in pa-
tients enrolled in the KEYNOTE-001 trial who 
had previously untreated NSCLC with a PD-L1 
tumor proportion score of 50% or greater and 
who were treated with pembrolizumab at a dose 
of 10 mg per kilogram4; these results suggest 
that 200 mg is an appropriate dose of pembro-
lizumab for this patient population.
The safety profile of pembrolizumab observed 
in this trial was consistent with that seen previ-
ously with pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
advanced NSCLC1,2 and other tumor types.12-16 
The safety profile of chemotherapy was also as 
expected. Immune-mediated adverse events (in-
cluding pneumonitis) occurred more frequently 
in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemo-
therapy group, whereas cytopenias occurred more 
frequently in the chemotherapy group than in the 
pembrolizumab group; these results are consis-
tent with the mechanism of action for each 
therapy. Most immune-mediated events were of 
grade 1 or 2 severity, and none led to death. 
However, the overall safety profile appeared to 
be better with pembrolizumab than with chemo-
therapy.
In conclusion, the results of the KEYNOTE-024 
trial showed that pembrolizumab was associated 
with longer progression-free and overall survival 
and fewer treatment-related adverse events than 
was platinum-based combination chemotherapy 
in patients with previously untreated advanced 
NSCLC and a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 
50% or greater.
