Summary
Background Pomalidomide and dexamethasone is a standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma in whom 
bortezomib and lenalidomide treatment has failed. KEYNOTE-183 assessed efficacy and safety of pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone with or without pembrolizumab in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. 
Here, we present the findings of an unplanned, ad-hoc interim analysis at the request of the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).
Methods KEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial done at 97 medical centres across 11 countries 
(Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). Patients aged at 
least 18 years with multiple myeloma, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1, 
previously treated with at least two lines of therapy (excluding pomalidomide) and refractory to the last line were 
randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group or the pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone group via an interactive voice response or integrated web response system. Patients received oral 
pomalidomide 4 mg daily on days 1–21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in 28-day 
cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. The dual primary endpoints were 
progression-free survival and overall survival. Efficacy was assessed in all randomly assigned patients and safety was 
assessed in patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02576977, and it is closed for accrual.
Findings Between Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 249 patients were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab 
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). On 
July 3, 2017, the FDA established that risks associated with the triple combination outweighed benefits and halted the 
study. Median follow-up was 8·1 months (IQR 4·5–10·9). Median progression-free survival was 5·6 months (95% CI 
3·7–7·5) in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 8·4 months (5·9–not reached) 
in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group; progression-free survival estimates at 6 months were 48% (95% CI 
37–58) versus 60% (49–69) at 6 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1·53; 95% CI 1·05–2·22; p=0·98). Median overall survival 
was not reached (95% CI 12·9–not reached) versus 15·2 months (12·7–not reached; HR 1·61; 95% CI 0·91–2·85; 
p=0·95); overall survival estimates at 6 months were 82% (95% CI 74–88) versus 90% (82–95). Serious adverse events 
occurred in 75 (63%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group versus 
56 (46%) of 121 patients in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. Four (3%) treatment-related deaths occurred 
in the pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (one each of unknown cause, neutropenic 
sepsis, myocarditis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome); myocarditis and Stevens-Johnson syndrome were considered 
related to pembrolizumab. No treatment-related deaths were reported in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group.
Interpretation The results from this unplanned, FDA-requested, interim analysis showed that the benefit–risk profile 
of pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone is unfavourable for patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma.

pomalidomide, proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib 
and carfilzomib, and effective combination with novel 
therapies with different mechanisms of action such as 
daratumumab have improved overall survival in multiple 
myeloma.3–9 Most patients still undergo cycles of remission 
and relapse until the disease becomes refractory. Prognosis 
is poor in patients who are refractory to immunomodulatory 
imides or proteasome inhibitors.10 Effective combination 
of novel therapies with different mechanisms of action 
remains an unmet need.
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanised mono-​
clonal antibody against PD-1 that blocks interaction between 
PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, with antitumour 
activity across multiple tumour types.11–14 In two phase 1 
studies, pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in combin­
ation with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone had 
manageable safety and promising antitumour activity in 
patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.15,16 In 
a phase 2 study, pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone led to a response in 60% of patients, a 
median response duration of 14·7 months (95% CI 7·9–
17·5), and manageable safety, supporting a randomised trial 
of pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with relapsed 
or refractory multiple myeloma.17
In the KEYNOTE-183 study, we assessed clinical effects 
of combining pembrolizumab with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma. We present the results of the 
unplanned, interim efficacy (survival outcomes and 
tumour response) and safety analyses.
Methods
Study design and participants
KEYNOTE-183 was a randomised, open-label, phase 3 
trial of pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone compared with pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma. Patients were enrolled at 
97 medical centres across 11 countries (Australia, 
Canada, 
France, 
Germany, 
Israel, 
Italy, 
Japan, 
New Zealand, Norway, Spain, and USA). The trial 
protocol is available in appendix 2 (pp 1–151). The study 
was done in accordance with the protocol and amend-​
ments, Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and subsequent 
amendments were approved by the appropriate 
institutional review board or ethics committee at each 
participating institution.
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We did a PubMed search using the terms “relapsed” and 
“multiple myeloma” filtered by article type (clinical trial) and 
publication dates (Jan 1, 2013, to Nov 27, 2018) with no 
language restrictions, which yielded 70 articles. Treatment of 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma poses the unique 
challenge of balancing efficacy and safety in patients who tend 
to have had many previous treatments and are older. Therefore, 
several ongoing phase 1 and 2 trials are being done to assess 
combinations of the following drugs: bendamustine, 
tivantinib, bortezomib, carfilzomib, ixazomib, delanzomib, 
venetoclax, ricolinostat, vorinostat, lenalidomide, 
pomalidomide, daratumumab, isatuximab, elotuzumab and 
pembrolizumab. The phase 2 ELOQUENT-3 study in patients 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma showed 
improved progression-free survival in patients treated with 
immunostimulatory antibody against SLAMF7 (elotuzumab) 
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone versus pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone alone (10·3 months vs 4·7 months; hazard 
ratio 0·54; p=0·008). This result led to the recent US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the elotuzumab 
combination in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.
Narrowing the search by adding filters for the terms “multiple 
myeloma” and “PD-1” yielded only two results relevant to 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma, both involving a PD-1 
inhibitor. One phase 2, single-arm trial reported acceptable 
safety (grade 3 or 4 adverse events in 40% of patients) and 
promising activity (response in 60% of patients and median 
progression-free survival of 17·4 months [95% CI 11·7–18·8]) 
with the combination of pembrolizumab and pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma. A phase 1b study showed acceptable safety 
(drug-related adverse events in 63% of patients) and 
antitumour activity (complete response after radiotherapy in 
one [4%] of 27 patients) with nivolumab in patients with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. These results provide 
a promising backdrop for the KEYNOTE-183 study.
Added value of this study
This phase 3 study was done to assess the efficacy and safety of 
the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab with pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma. Despite positive results in a previous study, 
an interim analysis done at a median follow-up of 8·1 months 
(IQR 4·5–10·9) at the request of the US FDA showed an 
unfavourable benefit–risk profile for the pembrolizumab plus 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone combination in patients 
with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and 
KEYNOTE-183 was halted.
Implications of all the available evidence
Although the results of KEYNOTE-183 are unlikely to change 
clinical practice in light of alternative, efficacious, and safe triplet 
and quadruplet treatments in this setting, this study might 
provide valuable information to guide the design of future 
clinical studies involving checkpoint inhibitors in relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma.

Eligibility criteria were age 18 years or older; confirmed 
diagnosis of active multiple myeloma and measurable 
disease; at least two previous lines of anti-myeloma 
therapy, including immunomodulatory imides (lenali-​
domide or thalidomide) and proteasome inhibitors 
(bortezomib, ixazomib, or carfilzomib); failure of last 
line of therapy, defined as refractory (resistant to 
treatment or documented progression during or within 
60 days of completing immunomodulatory imide or 
proteasome inhibitor-based treatment) or relapsed and 
refractory (relapse within 6 months of stopping treat­
ment with an immunomodulatory imide or proteasome 
inhibitor-containing regimen); Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1; 
adequate organ (protocol-defined haema­tological, renal, 
hepatic, and coagulation) function; and provision of 
bone marrow biopsy sample or aspirate material for 
disease assessment and biomarker analysis. Patients 
were ineligible if they had non-secretory or oligosecretory 
myeloma; smouldering multiple myeloma; monoclonal 
gammopathy of unknown significance; plasma cell 
leukaemia; Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia; hyper­
sensitivity to thalidomide, lenalidomide, or dexa­metha­
sone; previous therapy with pomalidomide; active 
autoimmune disease necessitating systemic treatment 
in the past 2 years; evidence of active, non-infectious 
pneumonitis; active infection requiring intravenous 
systemic therapy; known psychiatric or substance abuse 
disorders that would interfere with compliance with 
trial requirements; history of repeated infections, 
primary amyloidosis, hyperviscosity, or POEMS syn­
drome; history of immune suppression or is receiving 
systemic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy within 
7 days of first dose of study drug; previous monoclonal 
antibody within 4 weeks of study or ongoing adverse 
events due to drugs administered more than 4 weeks 
earlier; previous antimyeloma therapy within 2 weeks of 
study; previous allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (SCT) in 5 years before the study; 
autologous SCT in the 12 weeks before the study; 
plasmapheresis in the 4 weeks before the study; inability 
to undergo thrombo­embolic prophylaxis; peripheral 
neuropathy grade 2 or worse; another malignancy in the 
5 years before the study; previous therapy with an anti-
PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 antibody; 
HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C infection; received live 
vaccine in 30 days before first dose of study drug; or if 
they had an immediate relative who is investigational 
site or funder staff involved in this trial. All patients 
provided written informed consent to participate.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the pembro-​
lizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group 
or the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group using 
an interactive voice response system or integrated web 
response system (randomised allocation schedules were 
generated by the funder and provided to site staff as 
required via an automated telephone system). Rando-​
misation was stratified by number of previous lines of 
therapy (two vs ≥three) and disease status (lenalidomide 
refractory vs sensitive). This was an open-label study; 
therefore, masking was not performed.
Procedures
Patients received oral pomalidomide 4 mg daily on 
days 1–21 and oral low-dose dexamethasone 40 mg (20 mg 
for patients aged >75 years) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 in 
28-day cycles, with or without intravenous pembrolizumab 
200 mg every 3 weeks. Dose interruptions were permitted 
in cases of medical or surgical events or for logistical 
reasons unrelated to study therapy; patients continued 
with study therapy within 28 days of the scheduled 
interruption. Dose modification occurred per prespecified 
protocol guidance for each of the treatment drugs in 
response to toxicity (details in the redacted protocol). 
Treatment was continued until confirmed progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, or physician or patient decision to 
withdraw.
Disease response was assessed every 4 weeks; patients 
were considered non-evaluable if they had received at 
least one dose of study treatment but had not had post-
treatment assessment or if they had been assigned to a 
group but had not received study treatment. Patients who 
discontinued for reasons other than progression had 
post-treatment follow-up visits for disease status every 
4 weeks until progression, initiation of non-study cancer 
treatment, withdrawal of consent, or loss to follow-up. 
Patients were contacted for assessment of survival status 
every 12 weeks after the end of treatment.
Adverse events were graded per Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and monitored 
throughout treatment and for 30 days (90 days for serious 
adverse events) after treatment end. Immune-mediated 
adverse events were defined as adverse events—specified 
by the sponsor (non-serious and serious) and included 
by the investigator—associated with pembrolizumab 
exposure that were consistent with immune phenomena 
and had a potentially immunological cause regardless of 
attribution to study treatment or immune relatedness. 
Attribution of adverse events to the study drugs was 
determined by site investigators.
Patients could withdraw consent at any time for any 
reason or be excluded from the trial at the investigator’s 
discretion in the event of untoward effects. Patients could 
also have been withdrawn for the following reasons: 
documented disease progression, unacceptable adverse 
events, intercurrent illness preventing further study 
treatment, confirmed pregnancy, receipt of non-protocol-
specified anti-myeloma therapy before documented 
disease progression, non-adherence to trial treatment or 
procedures, loss to follow-up, and administrative reasons. 
The trial was to be terminated prematurely if quality or

quantity of data recording were inaccurate or incomplete, 
adherence to the protocol and regulatory requirements 
were poor, plans were made to modify or discontinue 
development of pembrolizumab, or in response to a 
request by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
or other health authority because of safety concerns.
Outcomes
The dual primary endpoints were progression-free 
survival, defined as time from randomisation to first 
documented disease progression or death from any 
cause per International Myeloma Working Group 2011 
criteria18 by masked independent central review, and 
overall survival, defined as time from randomisation to 
death from any cause. Secondary efficacy endpoints were 
overall response, duration of response, disease control, 
safety and tolerability of both treatments, and secondary 
progression-free survival (time from randomisation to 
subsequent disease progression after initiation of new 
anticancer therapy or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first, based on investigator assessment; not 
reported here). Overall response was the proportion of 
patients who achieved at least a partial response, assessed 
by masked central review.19,20 Duration of response was 
defined as the time from first documented partial 
response until progression or death, assessed by masked 
central review. Disease control was the proportion of 
patients with confirmed complete response, very good 
partial response, partial response, minimal response, or 
stable disease for at least 12 weeks before confirmed 
progression. The International Response Criteria for 
multiple myeloma19 were used to define complete, very 
good partial, and partial responses, and stable and 
progressive disease. Full description of these criteria is in 
appendix 1 (p 4). Median time to progression, defined as 
time 
from 
randomisation 
to 
first 
documented 
progression, was also assessed.
Statistical analysis
Hypothesis testing of objective response rate, progression-
free survival, and overall survival was controlled by a 
family-wise type I error rate of 2·5% (one-sided α).21 A 
sample size of 300 patients was planned. For progression-
free survival, based on 236 events (estimated to occur 
about 20 months after the first patient enrolled), the study 
had 90·6% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·635 
with pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexametha­
sone versus pomalidomide and dexamethasone (assuming 
median progression-free survival of 4·0 months) at a 
one-sided α of 1·5%. For overall survival, based on 
182 events (estimated to occur 10 months after progression-
free survival analysis), the study had 80·5% power to 
detect a HR of 0·6 for pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide 
and 
dexamethasone 
versus 
poma​lidomide 
and 
dexamethasone (assuming a median overall survival of 
12·7 months) at a one-sided α of 0·5%. For overall 
response, based on the first 210 randomly assigned 
patients, the study had 88·7% power to show 
a 25% difference between the groups (55% for pem­
brolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone vs 
30% pomalidomide and dexamethasone) at a one-sided α 
of 0·5%.
Progression-free survival was compared between 
treatment groups using a stratified log-rank test with a 
stratified Cox regression providing the HR. Proportions 
of progression events were estimated within treatment 
groups using the Kaplan-Meier method. Duration of 
response was assessed descriptively using Kaplan-Meier 
statistics. Safety was analysed using descriptive statistics 
overall and a tiered approach. There were no tier 1 events 
(subject to inferential testing for statistical significance 
between groups); tier 2 events, which must occur in at 
least four patients in any treatment group, were assessed 
using point estimates with 95% CIs for between-group 
comparisons; tier 3 events (adverse events that are 
neither tier 1 nor tier 2) were analysed using point 
estimates only. Immune-mediated adverse events were 
summarised separately by toxicity and grade (including 
counts, percentages, and 95% CIs). Two interim analyses 
were protocol-specified before final analysis: a final 
analysis of objective response and a final progression-
free survival analysis and interim overall survival analysis 
(appendix 2 p 104). Statistical analyses were done using 
SAS software, version 9.4.
Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population 
of all patients assigned to a treatment group. Safety was 
assessed in patients who received at least one dose of 
study treatment (safety population). An external data 
monitoring committee assessed safety and efficacy at 
interim 
timepoints 
and 
made 
recommendations 
regarding patient safety and study integrity. This trial is 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02576977.
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study was involved in study design, 
data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the 
report, but not data collection. All authors had full access 
to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Jan 18, 2016, and June 7, 2017, 348 patients were 
screened, of whom 97 were not eligible and two were not 
assigned to a group before the study was halted, and 
249 were randomly assigned to either the pembrolizumab 
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=125) or 
the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (n=124). Of 
these, 120 patients in the pembrolizumab plus 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group and 121 in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group were treated 
(figure 1). Dexamethasone 20 mg was given from the start 
of treatment in 81 patients (37 in the pembrolizumab plus 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group and 44 in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group). A list of key

changes made to the protocol after the start of the study is 
in appendix 1 (p 3). On July 3, 2017, the FDA halted 
KEYNOTE-183 on the basis of interim data presented to 
the data monitoring committee, which indicated that the 
risks associated with the pembrolizumab combination 
outweighed 
the 
benefits.22 
Pembrolizumab 
was 
immediately discontinued after the FDA decision to halt 
the trial and patients were transferred to available 
standard-of-care therapies at their physician’s discretion 
and according to local institutional regulations. Patient-
reported outcomes, pharmacokinetic endpoints, and 
exploratory biomarker endpoints were not analysed and 
the two preplanned interim analyses were not done 
because of early trial termination.
Baseline patient and disease characteristics were 
generally similar between groups (table 1). More patients 
in the pembrolizumab group had high-risk cytogenetics 
than in the pomalidomide and dexa-​methasone group 
(28 [22%] of 125 in the pembrolizumab group vs 17 [14%] 
of 124 in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group), 
including del17p13 (15 [12%] of 125 vs six [5%] of 124) and 
plasmacytoma (15 (12%) of 125 [six extramedullary] vs 
six [5%] of 124 [three extramedullary]; table 1). At the time 
of the unplanned interim analysis, median follow-up was 
8·1 months (IQR 4·5–10·9) across both groups and 
7·8 months (IQR 4·0–10·5) in the pembrolizumab group 
versus 8·6 months (IQR 5·1–11·1) in the pomalidomide 
and dexa​methasone group (appendix 1 p 5). At data 
cutoff, 40 (33%) of the 120 patients who started treatment 
in the pembrolizumab group versus 53 (44%) of the 
121 who  started treatment in the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone group were still on study treatment; 
80 (67%) patients versus 68 (56%) had discontinued 
(figure 1). Disease progression was the most common 
reason for study discontinuation in both treatment 
groups (46 [38%] patients in the pembrolizumab group vs 
41 
[34%] 
patients 
in 
the 
pomalidomide 
and 
dexamethasone group), followed by adverse events 
(22 [18%] vs nine [7%]). 18 (15%) patients in the 
pembrolizumab group and five (4%) in the pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone group discontinued because of 
treatment-related adverse events.
Because of premature study termination, progression-
free survival and response endpoints were assessed by 
substantiated investigator assessment. At database cutoff 
(June 2, 2017), median progression-free survival was 
5·6 months (95% CI 3·7–7·5) in the pembrolizumab

8·4 months (5·9–not reached) in the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone group; with an HR for disease 
progression or death of 1·53 (95% CI 1·05–2·22; p=0·98; 
figure 2A). The number of progression-free survival 
events was 115 (65 [52%] patients in the pembrolizumab 
group and 50 [40%] in the pomalidomide and dexa-​
methasone group). Median time to progression was 
8·1 months (95% CI 5·6–not reached) in the 
pembrolizumab group versus 8·7 months (6·6–not 
reached) in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group. Estimated progression-free survival was 48% 
(95% CI 37–58) versus 60% (49–69) at 6 months and 
68% (58–76) versus 79% (70–85) at 3 months (figure 2A). 
Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI 
12·9–not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 
15·2 months (12·7–not reached) in the pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone group; the HR for death was 1·61 
(95% CI 0·91–2·85; p=0·95). Estimated overall survival 
was 82% (95% CI 74–88) versus 90% (82–95) at 6 months 
and 90% (83–95) versus 98% (93–100) at 3 months 
(figure 2B). The HR for comparison of overall survival 
was similar among subgroups, except for ECOG 
performance status 0, disease stages 1 and 2, and patients 
from Japan (appendix 1 p 19). The HR for comparison of 
progression-free survival was similar among subgroups, 
except for the race (other) and Japan subgroups 
(appendix 1 p 20).

43 (34%; 95% CI 26·1–43·4) of 125 patients in the 
pembrolizumab group achieved an overall response 
(partial response or better) compared with 50 (40%; 
31·6–49·5) of 124 in the pomalidomide and dexa-​
methasone group (appendix 1 p 6). Disease control was 
achieved by 106 (85%; 77·3–90·6) patients in the 
pembrolizumab group and 105 (85%; 77·1–90·5) in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. Median 
duration of response was 8·2 months (95% CI 5·2–not 
reached) in the pembrolizumab group and was not 
reached in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group 
(appendix 1 p 5).
Median duration of study treatment was 123·5 days 
(IQR 57·5–225·0) in the pembrolizumab group and 
127·0 days (78·0–253·0) in the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone group (appendix 1 p 6); at analysis, 
patients had received a median of 4·4 cycles (2·0–9·0) of 
treatment.
Adverse events of any grade were reported in 119 (99%) 
of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab group versus 
116 (96%) of 121 in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group; grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 
90 (75%) of 120 versus 77 (64%) of 121 patients; and 
serious adverse events were reported in 75 (63%) of 120 
versus 56 (46%) of 121 patients (appendix 1 p 7). Grade 5 
adverse events occurred in 13 (11%) patients in the 
pembrolizumab group versus three (2%) in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (table 2). Any-
grade adverse events with an at least 5% difference in 
incidence between groups were neutropenia, anaemia, 
fatigue, pneumonia, nausea, headache, back pain, and 
increase in alanine aminotransferase (table 2). Grade 3 or 
4 adverse events with an at least 5% difference between 
groups were neutropenia (41 [34%] of 120 vs 26 [21%] of 
121) and thrombocytopenia (14 [12%] of 120 vs eight [7%] 
of 121). No serious adverse events occurred with at least a 
5% difference between groups; serious adverse events 
with at least 3% difference between groups are in 
appendix 1 (p 7). Data regarding timing of onset of 
adverse events are not available. Immune-mediated 
adverse 
events 
(most 
commonly 
pneumonitis, 
hyperthyroidism, and rash in 3% of patients each) 
occurred in 21 (18%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab 
group (table 3). The minimum median time to onset of 
any immune-mediated adverse event in patients who 
received pembrolizumab was 10 days (severe skin 
reaction), with an IQR of 14–65 across all immune-
mediated adverse events. Only one patient had immune-
mediated neutropenia, and there were no cases of 
immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.
Adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in 
24 (20%) of 120 patients in the pembrolizumab group 
versus ten (8%) of 121 patients in the pomalidomide and 
dexamethasone group. The most common (occurring in 
at least two patients in either group) were death (three [3%] 
vs 0), pneumonia (two [2%] vs one [1%]), neutropenic 
sepsis (two [2%] vs 0), cerebrovascular accident (two [2%]

vs one [1%]), and dyspnoea (two [2%] vs 0). Of these, 
the cases of neutropenic sepsis, pneumonia, and 
cerebrovascular accident were considered by the 
investigator to be related to treatment. Treatment-related 
adverse events resulted in treatment discontinuation in 
18 (15%) patients in the pembrolizumab group and 
five (4%) patients in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group; adverse events resulting in treatment interruption 
occurred in 72 (60%) and 60 (50%) patients.
As of June 2, 2017, 50 patients had died: 29 (23%) of 
125 in the pembrolizumab group (16 from progressive 
disease and 13 from adverse events) versus 21 (17%) of 
124 in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group 
(18 from progressive disease and three from adverse 
events). Four (3%) of 120 patients died as a result of 
treatment-related adverse events in the pembrolizumab 
group (one each of unknown cause, neutropenic sepsis, 
myocarditis, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome; table 4). 
Deaths from myocarditis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome 
were attributed to pembrolizumab by the investigator. 
Three non-treatment-related deaths occurred in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (one each of 
unknown cause, anaemia, and pneumonia; table 4). A 
review of disease characteristics among patients who died 
showed that more patients in the pembrolizumab group 
than the pomalidomide and dexamethasone group had 
International Staging System stage III disease (15 [52%] of 
29 in the pembrolizumab group vs four [19%] of 21 in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group), high-risk 
cytogenetics (ten [34%] vs six [29%]), plasmacytoma 
(seven [24%] vs three [14%]), and ECOG performance 
status of 1 (21 [72%] vs 13 [62%]) at baseline (appendix 1 
p 8). The HR for death was 1·23 (95% CI 0·57–2·66; 
p=0·69) when patients with these high-risk disease 
characteristics were excluded (appendix 1 p 21). After 
exclusion of patients with high-risk characteristics, of the 
13 deaths in the pembrolizumab group, four were from 
progression and nine were from adverse events (one each 
of myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, pericardial 
haemorrhage, and Stevens–Johnson syndrome, three 
sepsis, and two unknown cause); two of these adverse 
events (Stevens–Johnson syndrome and unknown cause) 
were considered by the investigator to be related to 
pembrolizumab. Of the 13 deaths in the pomalidomide 
and dexamethasone group after exclusion of patients with 
high-risk characteristics, 12 were from progression and 
one was from an adverse event (unknown death).
After study termination, a post-hoc analysis was done 
to identify potential factors associated with the imbalance 
in the number of deaths between the two treatment 
groups. Factors associated with being prognostic or 
predictive of death were first assessed by retrospective 
random forest analysis. A multivariable Cox regression 
analysis was subsequently done to calculate differences 
between groups with factors associated with risk for 
death identified from the random forest analysis. Age, 
ECOG performance status, disease stage, presence of 
plasmacytoma, and double-refractory status were more 
relevant contributors to death than treatment (appendix 1 
p 22). Multivariable analysis showed that age, ECOG 
performance status, and plasmacytoma significantly 
contributed to the risk for death. ECOG performance 
status was both prognostic and predictive of outcome. An 
ECOG performance status of 0 was associated with 
reduced risk for death (HR 0·86; 95% Wald confidence 
limits 0·32–2·29), whereas ECOG performance status 1 
was associated with increased risk for death (HR 2·3; 
95% Wald confidence limits 1·11–4·76). The clinical 
course of patients who died from adverse events in the 
pembrolizumab group is summarised in appendix 1 
(pp 9–18).
Discussion
In this non-protocol-specified interim analysis of 
KEYNOTE-183, after a median follow-up of 8·1 months 
(IQR 4·5–10·9), an increased risk for death was observed

with pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexa­
methasone versus poma​lidomide and dexamethasone 
alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma. The early mortality signal led to a halt of 
enrolment by the data monitoring committee and to 
subsequent study termination by the FDA on July 3, 2017.22 
Early study termination resulted in incomplete data 
collection; at analysis, only 50 (27%) of the 182 protocol-
specified events required for analysis of overall survival 
and 115 (49%) of the 236 required for analysis of 
progression-free survival had occurred. Treatment 
exposure was also shortened, with a median of 
4·5 treatment cycles (IQR 2·0–8·0) in the pembrolizumab 
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (37 [31%] 
of 120 patients had fewer than three cycles) compared 
with a median of 5·0 treatment cycles (3·0–9·0) in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group (29 [24%] of 
121 had fewer than three cycles). Longer follow-up 
is necessary to discern efficacy outcomes with 
immunotherapies given the non-proportional hazards 
effect that leads to delayed clinical response and late 
separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves.23–25 As such, 
although the overlapping CIs for progression-free survival 
and overall response in this premature analysis suggest

no difference between the two treatment groups, this 
interpretation is limited by the early study termination.
The acknowledged association between severity of 
disease and degree of immune system dysfunction26,27 
suggests that PD-1 blockade is safer and more effective in 
patients with lower burden of disease and less-impaired 
immune systems. Therefore, the failure of pembro-​
lizumab to improve the outcomes in patients with 
relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in our study 
population might be attributable to the considerable 
immunodeficiency that exists in these patients.28
The incidence of any-grade adverse events was similar 
between groups, although grade 3 or 4 and serious adverse 
events occurred more frequently with pembrolizumab 
plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone than with 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone. All common, non-
severe adverse events were manageable and no specific 
type led to treatment discontinuation. The most common 
immune-mediated adverse events were pneumonitis, 
hyperthyroidism, and rash (each in 3% of patients) in the 
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group. Two grade 5 immune-mediated adverse events of 
myo­carditis and Stevens–Johnson syndrome occurred, 
events expected per the label for pembrolizumab that 
were attributed to this drug.29 Overall, the type and 
incidence of immune-mediated adverse events in the 
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group were consistent with those reported previously for 
pembrolizumab11–14 and those observed in KEYNOTE-185.30
More deaths occurred in the pembrolizumab plus 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group than in the 
pomalidomide and dexamethasone group. However, the 
numbers of patients who discontinued or died from 
disease progression were similar between groups, 
suggesting that the risk for progression was similar, 
implying 
that 
progression-free 
survival 
in 
the 
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group could have been influenced by the imbalance in the 
number of deaths, two of which were pembrolizumab 
related. Similarly, in the KEYNOTE-185 study30 of patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, more deaths 
occurred in the pembrolizumab plus lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone group (19 [13%] of 149) than in the 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone group (nine [6%] 
of 145).
The frequency of high-risk features at baseline among 
patients who died prematurely was higher in the 
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group than in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group, despite the safeguard of randomisation. Disease 
characteristics were generally not balanced between the 
treatment groups in this study, probably because patient 
enrolment was still ongoing at the time of early study 
termination and the unplanned ad-hoc nature of the 
analysis. Specifically, among the patients who died early 
during the study, a greater proportion of those in the 
pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group than in the pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
group had stage III disease, high-risk cytogenetics, or 
extramedullary plasmacytoma (three [43%] of  seven vs 
one [33%] of three), factors typically associated with poorer 
prognosis; this imbalance might account for the difference 
in early death that led to early termination of KEYNOTE-183. 
Moreover, when adverse-event-related death was assessed 
between the two treatment groups, after removal of 
patients with these high-risk characteristics, there was no 
significant difference in numbers of deaths between 
groups. A multivariable analysis to identify factors 
associated with risk for death indicated that only ECOG 
performance status 1 was both predictive and prognostic of 
risk for death. This might indicate that the performance 
status assessment of patients at study entry was under­
estimated, considering patients with ECOG performance 
status of 2 are usually included in multiple myeloma 
clinical studies but were not (per exclusion criteria) in this 
study. Together, these analyses suggest that the imbalance 
in the number of deaths is not only related to treatment 
(two deaths were pembrolizumab related) but also to non-
treatment-related adverse events.
This study was limited by the ad-hoc unplanned nature 
of the analysis. The trial was terminated during the 
enrolment period. Early termination also probably 
affected results of this unplanned analysis because of the 
absence of longer-term follow-up efficacy data. The 
findings of this study are not generalisable to other 
indications; it is not possible to establish whether the 
problems encountered in the patients who received 
pembrolizumab in combination with standard-of-care 
therapy would be observed in other indications.
Our findings are disappointing given the positive 
outcomes reported in the previous phase 2 study of

pembrolizumab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone 
in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma.17 In the previous trial, the combination was 
well tolerated and showed encouraging antimyeloma 
activity, with a response achieved by 29 (60%) of 48 
patients and median progression-free survival of 
17·4 months (95% CI 11·7–18·8);17 median follow-up was 
longer than in our study.
Although these data showed an imbalance in the 
number of deaths between treatment groups, the interim 
analyses were underpowered and inconclusive because 
of the shortened follow-up at termination. Additional 
studies are necessary to optimise identification of 
patients who would benefit from PD-1 inhibition in 
combination with pomalidomide. Furthermore, given 
the effectiveness of pembrolizumab combinations in the 
treatment of other diseases, checkpoint inhibitors should 
be appropriately investigated with other treatment 
backbones.
