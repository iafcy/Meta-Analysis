Purpose
Patients with squamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have poor prognosis and limited
treatment options. This randomized, double-blind, phase III study investigated the efﬁcacy and
safety of ﬁrst-line ipilimumab or placebo plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced squamous
NSCLC.
Patients and Methods
Patients with stage IV or recurrent chemotherapy-na¨ıve squamous NSCLC were randomly assigned
(1:1) to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks
on a phased induction schedule comprising six chemotherapy cycles, with ipilimumab or placebo
from cycles 3 to 6 and then, after induction treatment, ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every
12 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in
patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy.
Results
Of 956 randomly assigned patients, 749 received at least one dose of blinded study therapy
(chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 388; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 361). Median OS was
13.4 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 12.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo
(hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; P = .25). Median progression-free survival was 5.6 months
for both groups (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01). Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related
adverse events (TRAEs), any-grade serious TRAEs, and TRAEs leading to discontinuation were
numerically higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (51%, 33%, and 28%, respectively) than
with chemotherapy plus placebo (35%, 10%, and 7%, respectively). Seven treatment-related
deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, and one occurred with chemotherapy plus
placebo.
Conclusion
The addition of ipilimumab to ﬁrst-line chemotherapy did not prolong OS compared with chemo-
therapy alone in patients with advanced squamous NSCLC. The safety proﬁle of chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab was consistent with that observed in previous lung and melanoma studies. Ongoing
studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab in this population.

INTRODUCTION
Squamous non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
comprises approximately 30% of all NSCLCs.1
Platinum-based chemotherapy, the standard ﬁrst-
line treatment for most patients with advanced
squamous NSCLC, has limited long-term beneﬁt
and is associated with a median overall survival
(OS) of only 8 to 11 months.2-5 The only targeted
agent that has shown moderate survival beneﬁt
(median OS, 11.5 months) in the ﬁrst-line setting
is the epidermal growth factor receptor antibody
necitumumab when combined with chemo-
therapy.6 Novel approaches are needed to im-
prove outcomes for this patient population.
Squamous NSCLC has been shown to be
a highly immunogenic tumor type7-13 and is

therefore well-suited for immunotherapy-based regimens. This
is supported by the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors
targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway (nivolu-
mab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab)14-19 in NSCLC.
Ipilimumab, a cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-
4) inhibitor,20 has shown activity in several tumor types21-25 and
signiﬁcantly improved OS in patients with advanced melanoma.26
CTLA-4 blockade with ipilimumab has been shown to synergize
with chemotherapy in preclinical murine tumor models.27 Ipili-
mumab combined with chemotherapy has also shown promise in
patients; in a phase III trial, ipilimumab plus dacarbazine improved
OS versus dacarbazine in patients with advanced melanoma.28,29
In a randomized phase II study, patients with chemotherapy-
na¨ıve squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC received ipilimumab in
phased (in cycles 3 to 6 of six chemotherapy cycles) or concurrent
(in cycles 1 to 4 of six chemotherapy cycles) dosing regimens with
paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by ipilimumab maintenance.
Ipilimumab administered in the phased regimen signiﬁcantly pro-
longed immune-related progression-free survival (irPFS) compared
with chemotherapy alone (median, 5.7 v 4.6 months, respectively;
hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; P = .05) and progression-free survival (PFS)
by modiﬁed WHO (mWHO) criteria (5.1 v 4.2 months, respectively;
HR, 0.69; P = .02). However, ipilimumab administered in the con-
current regimen did not signiﬁcantly improve irPFS (HR, 0.81;
P = .13) or mWHO PFS (HR, 0.88; P = .25) versus chemotherapy
alone.30 With phased ipilimumab, greater improvements in efﬁcacy
were noted in patients with squamous NSCLC (irPFS HR, 0.55; 95%
CI, 0.27 to 1.12; mWHO PFS HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.87) than in
patients with nonsquamous NSCLC (irPFS HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.52 to
1.28; mWHO PFS HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.26). On the basis of
these results, this randomized, double-blind, phase III trial evaluated
ipilimumab administered in a phased regimen with carboplatin and
paclitaxel versus placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients
with chemotherapy-na¨ıve stage IV or recurrent squamous NSCLC
(Study 104; ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT01285609).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients age $ 18 years with histologically or cytologically conﬁrmed
recurrent or stage IV squamous NSCLC, measurable disease per mWHO
criteria,31,32 an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
status (PS) of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function were eligible. Key exclusion
criteria included prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic
NSCLC (except radiation therapy or locoregional surgery or adjuvant or
neoadjuvant therapycompleted $ 1 year before enrolling) and a historyof brain
metastases. Additional exclusion criteria are listed in the Data Supplement.
The protocol was approved by each participating center’s ethics
committee or institutional review board. The study was run in accordance
with Good Clinical Practice (deﬁned by the International Conference on
Harmonization) and the ethical principles underlying European Union
Directive 2001/20/EC and the US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21,
Part 50 (21CFR50). All patients provided written, informed consent to
their participation in the study. An independent data monitoring com-
mittee provided study oversight.
Study Design and Treatment
In this multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase III
study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive blinded ipilimumab
or placebo. Random assignment was stratiﬁed by ECOG PS (0 v 1),
smoking status (heavy smokers [patients who smoked $ 10 pack-years] v
light smokers or nonsmokers [patients who did not meet the criteria to be
classiﬁed as a heavy smoker]), sex, and region (North America or Western
Europe v other). The trial had two phases—induction and maintenance
(Fig 1A). Induction treatment was paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 plus carboplatin
area under the concentration-time curve 6, both given intravenously (IV)
every 3 weeks for six 3-week cycles starting at random assignment, with
blinded ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo IV given every 3 weeks for up to
four doses, starting at cycle 3. Patients with a complete response (CR),
partial response, or stable disease after induction treatment were eligible
for maintenance treatment. Maintenance, beginning 9 weeks after the ﬁnal
induction dose of ipilimumab or placebo, comprised blinded ipilimumab
10 mg/kg or placebo IV given every 12 weeks until progressive disease per
mWHO criteria31,32 or unacceptable toxicity, for # 3 years from the ﬁrst
dose of blinded treatment. The dosing schedule for ipilimumab was based
on prior phase II and III trials in melanoma24-26,28 and a prior phase II trial
in NSCLC.30
In the event of toxicity, protocol-determined paclitaxel and carbo-
platin dose adjustments and blinded study drug dose delays were allowed;
blinded study drug dose reductions were not permitted. Criteria for
treatment delay and discontinuation as a result of treatment-related ad-
verse events (TRAEs) are provided in the Data Supplement.
End Points
The primary end point was OS among all randomly assigned patients
who received at least one dose of blinded therapy (modiﬁed intent-to-treat
[mITT] population). Secondary end points were OS among all randomly
assigned patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and PFS in the mITT
population. Other end points included objective response rate (ORR),
duration of response, and safety.
The original primary and secondary end points in the study were OS
in the ITTand mITT populations, respectively; however, a pooled, blinded
review of the initial data showed a higher than anticipated rate of dis-
continuation before the initiation of blinded therapy, making any ipili-
mumab effect difﬁcult to detect in an ITT analysis. To measure the
treatment effect of ipilimumab more accurately, the mITT analysis was
made the primary analysis through a protocol amendment (on April 2014,
at which time enrollment was nearly [98%] complete).
Assessments
Standard baseline assessments are described in the Data Supplement.
Tumors were measured using chest and abdomen computed tomography
and magnetic resonance imaging scans at baseline; at weeks 7, 13, 19, and
25; and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression or end of
treatment. Tumor response was assessed by the investigator using mWHO
criteria.31,32 Patients were observed for survival every 12 weeks after
treatment discontinuation. Safety was evaluated by monitoring adverse events
(AEs) and laboratory parameters until all AEs had resolved, had returned to
baseline levels, or were deemed irreversible. Toxicity was graded using National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version
3.0.33 AEs of interest consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism (in-
cluding enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatitis, endocrinopathies, and neuropathies)
and considered drug related by the investigator were classiﬁed as immune-
related AEs (irAEs).
Statistical Analysis
The study aimed to randomly assign approximately 920 patients (1:1)
to the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo
arms. Assuming a 24% dropout rate during the ﬁrst 2 cycles of chemo-
therapy alone, it was estimated that approximately 700 patients would
receive blinded study therapy. The primary analysis was to be performed
after at least 518 events had occurred in the mITT population. This
number ensured that a two-sided a = .05 level test would have 90%

power if the true HR for the ﬁrst 2 cycles was 1 and the HR after blinded
therapy initiation was 0.75. A median OS of 10 months in the che-
motherapy plus placebo arm after 2 cycles of chemotherapy was also
assumed. As a second condition, at least 705 events in the ITT pop-
ulation were required for the database to be locked (per the original
study design). Statistical considerations for the ITT population are
included in the Data Supplement.
OS was deﬁned as the time from random assignment until death. For
patients who did not die, OS was censored at the last date they were known
to be alive. In the mITT population, OS and PFS between treatment arms
were compared using an unstratiﬁed, two-sided, log-rank test; the HR and
corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using an unstratiﬁed Cox model
with treatment arm as the only covariate. OS and PFS distributions were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. ORR per mWHO was cal-
culated for each treatment arm, with corresponding 95% CIs calculated
using the Clopper-Pearson method.
After a crossing of the OS curves was observed, a post-hoc analysis
was conducted to examine the proportional hazards assumption for OS by
testing for a treatment-period interaction, with period deﬁned as a binary
variable (before or after the time point when the curves crossed). A
piecewise hazards model was used to provide estimates of the HR over time
(ie, before, during, and after the crossover of the survival curves).
RESULTS
Patients and Treatment
Between August 2011 and June 2015, 1,289 patients were
assessed for eligibility, and 956 patients at 233 sites in 34 countries
were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel and carboplatin plus
ipilimumab (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab; n = 479) or pacli-
taxel and carboplatin plus placebo (chemotherapy plus placebo;
n = 477; Figs 1A and 1B). Four patients in each arm did not receive
any treatment, and 87 patients (18%) and 112 patients (24%) in
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus pla-
cebo arms, respectively, discontinued treatment before receiving
the blinded study drug, most commonly because of progressive
disease (Data Supplement). This report focuses on efﬁcacy and
safety analyses in randomly assigned patients who received at least
one dose of the blinded study drug (mITT population), including
388 patients (81%) and 361 patients (76%) in the chemotherapy
plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo arms, re-
spectively. Baseline characteristics and OS in the ITT population
are presented in the Data Supplement.
Baseline characteristics in the mITT population were generally
well balanced between treatment arms (Table 1). Median age was
64 years (range, 28 years to 85 years). Most patients were male
(85%), white (69%), and heavy smokers (88%), and had an ECOG
PS of 1 (65%). The median number of blinded study drug doses
received in the induction and maintenance phases was similar in
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm (four doses; range, one to
15 doses) and chemotherapy plus placebo arms (four doses; range,
one to 12 doses). However, only 52% of patients in the chemo-
therapy plus ipilimumab arm received the four planned blinded
therapy induction doses compared with 76% of patients in the
chemotherapy plus placebo arm (Data Supplement). Exposure to
chemotherapy was lower in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
arm (median, ﬁve doses received; range, one to seven doses received)
than in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm (median, six doses
received; range, one to seven doses received; Data Supplement). A
total of 109 patients (28%) and 124 patients (34%) in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus pla-
cebo arms, respectively, started maintenance treatment; at the
time of analysis, nine patients (2%) and eight patients (2%) in each
arm remained on treatment (Data Supplement). After discontinuing
study treatment, 183 patients (47%) and 207 patients (57%) in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy plus placebo
arms, respectively, received subsequent chemotherapy or immu-
notherapy (Data Supplement).
Efficacy
At database lock (September 1, 2015), 553 patients (74%) had
died. The median follow-up time for survival was 12.5 months for
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm and 11.8 months for the
chemotherapy plus placebo arm. The study did not meet its
primary end point; there was no statistically signiﬁcant difference
in OS between the two treatment arms in the mITT population
(HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.07; log-rank P = .25; Fig 2A). The
Kaplan-Meier curves suggested nonproportional hazards, with the

curve for the ipilimumab arm initially lying below that for the
placebo arm, but crossing at approximately 10 months and remaining
above the placebo arm thereafter. A test for a treatment-period in-
teraction (before 10 months and after) veriﬁed that the proportionality
assumptionwas violated (P = .024). This prompted the development of
an exploratory piecewise hazards model to estimate the HR over the
following three different time periods: before 8 months, between 8 and
16 months, and after 16 months; the estimated HRs for these time
periods were 1.44 (95% CI, 1.08 to 1.92), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.86),
and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.57 to 1.23), respectively.
In the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy
plus placebo arms, median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI,
11.8 months to 14.8 months) and 12.4 months (95% CI,
11.6 months to 13.6 months), respectively; 1-year OS rates were
54% and 53%, respectively; and 2-year OS rates were 24% and
18%, respectively. The HRs for OS across predeﬁned patient

subgroups generally did not seem to favor one treatment over
the other (Fig 2B).
PFS did not differ between the treatment arms (HR, 0.87;
95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01; unstratiﬁed log-rank P = .07), and the
Kaplan-Meier curves suggested nonproportional hazards
(Fig 3). Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.4 months to
5.9 months) with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and 5.6 months
(95% CI, 5.5 months to 5.7 months) with chemotherapy plus
placebo.
ORRs were 44% (including one CR) and 47% (including two
CRs) in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy
plus placebo arms, respectively; median duration of response was
numerically higher in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm
than in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm (5.7 months [95% CI,
5.1 months to 6.7 months] v 4.7 months [95% CI, 4.3 months to
5.6 months], respectively; Table 2). Stable disease occurred in 37%
and 47% of patients in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and
chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively.
Safety
TRAEs occurred in 89% (grade 3 to 5, 53%) and 81% (grade 3
to 5, 36%) of patients in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and
chemotherapy plus placebo arms, respectively (Table 3). The most
common grade 3 or 4 TRAEs were neutropenia (14%), ane-
mia (12%), diarrhea (7%), and thrombocytopenia (7%) in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm. Neutropenia (14%), anemia
(7%), and thrombocytopenia (4%) were the most common grade 3
or 4 TRAEs in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm. Serious TRAEs
occurred more frequently with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
than with chemotherapy plus placebo (any grade, 33% v 10%, re-
spectively; grade 3 to 5, 28% v 9%, respectively; Data Supplement). In
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, there were seven
treatment-related deaths as a result of acute hepatic failure, acute
kidney insufﬁciency, anemia, intestinal perforation, ischemic
colitis, multiorgan failure, and pneumonia (n = 1 for each). In the
chemotherapy plus placebo arm, one patient died as a result of
treatment-related sepsis with septic shock. Discontinuations as
a result of TRAEs were more frequent in the chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab arm than the chemotherapy plus placebo arm
(any grade, 28% v 7%, respectively; grade 3 or 4, 20% v 3%,
respectively; Data Supplement). The most common TRAEs
leading to discontinuation were diarrhea (6%), colitis (3%),
peripheral sensory neuropathy (2%), and anemia (2%) in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm. The most common TRAE
leading to discontinuation was peripheral sensory neuropathy
(1%) in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm.
The most common irAEs in the chemotherapy plus ipi-
limumab arm were dermatologic (36%), GI (28%), and
neurologic (27%) in nature; the most frequently reported
individual irAEs were diarrhea (27% v 11% in the chemo-
therapy plus placebo arm), rash (17% v 4% in the chemo-
therapy plus placebo arm), and pruritus (14% v 2% in the
chemotherapy plus placebo arm; Data Supplement). Endocrine
irAEs were reported in 9% of patients in the chemotherapy plus
ipilimumab arm and included decreased thyroid-stimulating
hormone levels (3%), hyperthyroidism (2%), and adrenal
insufﬁciency (1%). The median time to onset (from the ﬁrst
blinded study therapy dose) of grade 2 to 5 irAEs in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm ranged from approxi-
mately 4 weeks for GI, neurologic, and skin events to 12 weeks
for endocrine events (Data Supplement). Most grade 2 to 4
irAEs (186 of 264 patients; 70%) had resolved by time of
analysis (Data Supplement).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest phase III trial of a ﬁrst-line
immune checkpoint inhibitor conducted in patients with advanced
squamous NSCLC. The trial did not meet its primary end point;
the addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy as ﬁrst-line treatment
did not result in a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS versus
chemotherapy alone. This result was generally consistent across
predeﬁned patient subgroups. Similarly, secondary efﬁcacy end
points, including OS in all randomly assigned patients, PFS, and
ORR, did not differ between treatment arms.
The overall safety proﬁle of chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
was consistent with that reported in previous phase III studies in
melanoma and SCLC28,34 and the phase II trial in NSCLC.30 No
new safety concerns were identiﬁed. Immune-related toxicities
were manageable using established safety guidelines. However, in
the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, compared with the
chemotherapy plus placebo arm, there were higher rates of grade 3
to 5 TRAEs (53% v 36%, respectively) and discontinuation as
a result of TRAEs (28% v 7%, respectively).
The toxicity and high treatment discontinuation rates in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm seem to have affected the
extent of exposure to chemotherapy, in addition to ipilimumab. In
fact, exposure to chemotherapy was lower in the chemotherapy
plus ipilimumab arm; only 46% of patients in the chemotherapy
plus ipilimumab arm received all six doses of chemotherapy versus
67% of patients in the chemotherapy plus placebo arm. Conse-
quently, survival in this arm may have been affected, with fewer

patients in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm able to beneﬁt
from chemotherapy compared with the control arm. The higher
initial mortality observed in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
arm versus the control arm was probably also a result of the re-
duced exposure to chemotherapy during the induction phase. This
increased initial mortality in the chemotherapy plus ipilimumab
arm combined with the delayed long-term effects of ipilimumab
may have, in turn, led to the crossing of the OS curves at
10 months. In summary, the reduced chemotherapy exposure,
triggered by the toxicity and higher discontinuation rates in the
chemotherapy plus ipilimumab arm, potentially contributed to the
failure of the study.
The results of this study mirror those of a similar phase III trial
in patients with chemotherapy-na¨ıve extensive-stage small-cell
lung cancer (SCLC; ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT01450761)34
in which the addition of phased ipilimumab to chemotherapy failed
to improve OS compared with chemotherapy alone. It was hy-
pothesized that ipilimumab, which stimulates early-stage T-cell
activation in the lymphoid compartment, may not generate a suf-
ﬁciently strong antitumor response in SCLC without corresponding
effector T-cell stimulation within the localized tumor microenvi-
ronment.35 This explanation may also hold true for squamous
NSCLC. Supporting this premise, robust activity of the combination
of ipilimumab and nivolumab (which activates T-cell function in the
tumor microenvironment) was noted in patients with recurrent
SCLC.36 Squamous NSCLC, like SCLC, has a high mutational
burden and is therefore a good PD-1 target.37,38 Survival beneﬁt with
PD-1 inhibitors has been observed in NSCLC in the previously
treated14-16,18,19 and ﬁrst-line settings.17,39,40 In a phase I study, ﬁrst-
line nivolumab plus ipilimumab showed promising activity and
manageable safety in patients with advanced NSCLC.41
On the basis of the activity and safety proﬁle of the nivolumab
plus ipilimumab combination observed in both NSCLC41 and
melanoma,42 combining PD-1 inhibition with CTLA-4 checkpoint
inhibition may represent a promising strategy for ﬁrst-line treatment
of squamous NSCLC. Ongoing studies are evaluating PD-1 inhibitors
in combination with other agents, including platinum-based
chemotherapy and CTLA-4 inhibitors, and newer agents (OX-40,
lymphocyte activation gene 3 protein, and T-cell immunoglobulin
and mucin domain 3 inhibitors) in the ﬁrst-line treatment of
NSCLC.
In conclusion, phased ipilimumab in combination with
chemotherapy did not improve survival versus chemotherapy
alone as ﬁrst-line treatment of squamous NSCLC. Combination
immunotherapy regimens and other agents in development offer
more effective treatment options for this patient population.
