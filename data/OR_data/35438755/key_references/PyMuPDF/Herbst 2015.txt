Summary
Background Despite recent advances in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, there remains a need 
for eﬀ ective treatments for progressive disease. We assessed the eﬃ  cacy of pembrolizumab for patients with 
previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
Methods We did this randomised, open-label, phase 2/3 study at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries. Patients 
with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of tumour cells were randomly 
assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six per stratum with an interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, or docetaxel 75 mg/m² every 3 weeks. The primary endpoints were overall survival 
and progression-free survival both in the total population and in patients with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of 
tumour cells. We used a threshold for signiﬁ cance of p<0·00825 (one-sided) for the analysis of overall survival and a 
threshold of p<0·001 for progression-free survival. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01905657.
Findings Between Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we enrolled 1034 patients: 345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 
346 allocated to pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 allocated to docetaxel. By Sept 30, 2015, 521 patients had died. In 
the total population, median overall survival was 10·4 months with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 12·7 months with 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 8·5 months with docetaxel. Overall survival was signiﬁ cantly longer for pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·58–0·88; p=0·0008) and for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
versus docetaxel (0·61, 0·49–0·75; p<0·0001). Median progression-free survival was 3·9 months with pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg, 4·0 months with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 4·0 months with docetaxel, with no signiﬁ cant diﬀ erence 
for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel (0·88, 0·74–1·05; p=0·07) or for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus 
docetaxel (HR 0·79, 95% CI 0·66–0·94; p=0·004). Among patients with at least 50% of tumour cells expressing 
PD-L1, overall survival was signiﬁ cantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 
14·9 months vs 8·2 months; HR 0·54, 95% CI 0·38–0·77; p=0·0002) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with 
docetaxel (17·3 months vs 8·2 months; 0·50, 0·36–0·70; p<0·0001). Likewise, for this patient population, progression-
free survival was signiﬁ cantly longer with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg than with docetaxel (median 5·0 months vs 
4·1 months; HR 0·59, 95% CI 0·44–0·78; p=0·0001) and with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg than with docetaxel 
(5·2 months vs 4·1 months; 0·59, 0·45–0·78; p<0·0001). Grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events were less 
common with pembrolizumab than with docetaxel (43 [13%] of 339 patients given 2 mg/kg, 55 [16%] of 343 given 
10 mg/kg, and 109 [35%] of 309 given docetaxel).
Interpretation Pembrolizumab prolongs overall survival and has a favourable beneﬁ t-to-risk proﬁ le in patients with 
previously treated, PD-L1-positive, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. These data establish pembrolizumab as a 
new treatment option for this population and validate the use of PD-L1 selection.

Introduction
Although treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer has 
improved in recent years with the development of 
targeted drugs for patients with amenable mutations,1–5 
only a small proportion of patients have these mutations, 
and most tumours become resistant to targeted 
treatment.6 Immunotherapy is a new paradigm for the 
treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer, and targeting 
the PD-1 pathway is a promising therapeutic option.7–11 
The PD-1 receptor is an immune checkpoint inhibitor 
expressed on activated B and T cells that normally down-
modulates excessive immune responses.12,13 Binding of 
PD-1 to its ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) on tumour cells 
suppresses T cells through a negative feedback loop, 
leading to evasion of the immune response.14–17
Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is a highly selective, 
humanised, IgG4 monoclonal antibody against PD-1. 
Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg given once every 3 weeks was 
granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment 
of patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer

whose tumours express PD-L1 (as determined by test 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) with 
disease progression during or after platinum-containing 
chemotherapy. This approval was based on data from 
550 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer enrolled in 
the large, multicohort, phase 1b KEYNOTE-001 study.9,18 In 
KEYNOTE-001, a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% 
or greater, deﬁ ned as PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of 
tumour cells (appendix p 5), was associated with better 
outcomes.9
We present results of KEYNOTE-010, the ﬁ rst 
randomised comparison of pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or 
10 mg/kg every 3 weeks versus standard-of-care treatment 
for PD-L1-positive non-small-cell lung cancer that 
progressed after at least platinum-based chemotherapy. 
This study is the ﬁ rst active-control trial that enrolled 
patients on the basis of prospective assessment of 
tumour PD-L1 expression based on the association 
between higher PD-L1 expression and greater clinical 
beneﬁ t from pembrolizumab.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial 
at 202 academic medical centres in 24 countries (Argentina, 
Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, 
Lithuania, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, 
South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, UK, and USA). We included 
patients aged at least 18 years, with progression as per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; 
version 1.1)19 after two or more cycles of platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy, as well as an appropriate tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor for those with an EGFR-sensitising mutation or 
ALK gene rearrangement; measurable disease as per 
investigator-assessed RECIST; an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1; provision of 
a tumour sample; and PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of 
tumour cells (ie, a tumour proportion score ≥1%). Initially, 
any tumour sample was permitted for PD-L1 testing. The 
study protocol was later amended to require a new tumour 
sample for PD-L1 testing except when attempting to take a 
biopsy would be too risky. To be considered a new sample, 
no intervening treatment was permitted between the time 
the sample was taken and initiation of study treatment. 
The only exception was that patients receiving tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors before the biopsy was taken were 
permitted to resume them after sample collection. 
456 patients were enrolled on the basis of archival samples.
Key exclusion criteria were previous treatment with 
PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors or docetaxel, known active 
brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis, active 
autoimmune disease requiring systemic steroids, and 
interstitial lung disease or history of pneumonitis 
requiring systemic steroids. The appendix shows all the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The study protocol and all amendments were approved 
by the appropriate institutional review boards and ethics 
committees at each institution. The study was done in 
accordance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
Panel: Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed on Nov 2, 2015, using the following terms: 
“PD-1 OR PD-L1 OR MK-3475 OR pembrolizumab OR 
lambrolizumab OR Keytruda OR nivolumab OR BMS-936558 OR 
Opdivo OR atezolizumab OR MPDL3280A OR BMS-936559 OR 
durvalumab OR MEDI4736 OR avelumab OR MSB0010718C OR 
docetaxel” AND “non-small-cell lung cancer OR NSCLC”. The 
search was not limited by date. We also searched the abstracts for 
the 2014 and 2015 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual 
Meetings, the 2014 European Society for Medical Oncology 
Congress, and the 2015 European Cancer Congress using the same 
search terms. We identiﬁ ed three randomised trials of anti-PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1 treatment versus docetaxel for non-small-cell lung 
cancer: the CheckMate 017 study of nivolumab for squamous non-
small-cell lung cancer, the CheckMate 057 study of nivolumab for 
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, and the POPLAR study 
of atezolizumab for squamous and non-squamous non-small-cell 
lung cancer. We focused on the CheckMate studies because they 
are published in peer-reviewed journals.
Added value of this study
Results of KEYNOTE-010 conﬁ rm the eﬃ  cacy and safety of PD-1 
inhibition with pembrolizumab in patients with previously 
treated non-small-cell lung cancer. These data are the ﬁ rst 
published report of a randomised, controlled clinical trial of 
non-small-cell lung cancer that prospectively shows the utility 
of PD-L1 as a biomarker. This study is also the ﬁ rst of a PD-1 
inhibitor for non-small-cell lung cancer to include patients who 
received more than one line of previous treatment. Both 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 
3 weeks provided superior overall survival compared with 
docetaxel, with similar outcomes for each pembrolizumab 
dose. Pembrolizumab was also associated with fewer 
high-grade toxic eﬀ ects than was docetaxel.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our data support pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg given every 3 weeks 
as a new treatment option for patients with non-small-cell 
lung cancer with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of at least 
1% that progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and, 
in those with an EGFR sensitising mutation or an ALK 
translocation, an appropriate tyrosine kinase inhibitor. These 
data also validate the use of PD-L1 on tumour cells as a 
biomarker to identify patients most likely to obtain a beneﬁ t 
from pembrolizumab.

guidelines, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients 
provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) with a central 
interactive voice-response system to receive pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg intravenously over 30 min every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg 
intravenously over 30 min every 3 weeks, or docetaxel 
75 mg/m² intravenously over 1 h every 3 weeks. The 
allocation schedule was generated by the system vendor 
using a computerised randomised list generator. Patients 
were stratiﬁ ed by Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group 
performance status (0 vs 1) and region (east Asia vs not east 
Asia). A third stratiﬁ cation variable, extent of PD-L1 
expression (tumour proportion score ≥50% vs 1–49%), was 
added after 441 patients were allocated and the PD-L1 
immuno histochemistry assay cutpoint was established.9 
Treatment was allocated in blocks of six in each stratum.

5
4–6 weeks later. Per protocol, patients in the docetaxel 
group were not permitted to cross over to receive 
pembrolizumab.
Radiographic imaging was done every 9 weeks. 
Response was assessed as per RECIST version 1.1 by 
independent central review (for eﬃ  cacy) and as per 
immune-related response criteria by investigator (to 
inform treatment decisions). Adverse events were graded 
according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). 
PD-L1 expression was assessed at a central laboratory 
with an immunohistochemistry assay (Dako; Carpinteria, 
CA, USA) with the murine 22C3 anti-human PD-L1 
antibody (Merck; Kenilworth, NJ, USA), as previously 
described (appendix p 5).9
Outcomes
The primary endpoints were overall survival (time from 
randomisation to death due to any cause) and 
progression-free survival (time from randomisation to 
radiologically conﬁ rmed progressive disease or death 
due to any cause) both in the total population (ie, tumour 
proportion score of 1% or greater) and in patients with 
tumour proportion score of 50% or greater. Secondary 
endpoints were safety, response rate (percentage of 
patients with complete or partial response as per RECIST 
version 1.1), and duration of response (time from ﬁ rst 
evidence of response until disease progression or death).
We did prespeciﬁ ed subgroup analyses of age, sex, 
Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group performance 
status, EGFR mutation status, and age of tumour sample. 
We also did post-hoc exploratory subgroup analyses of 
tumour histology.
We analysed overall survival, progression-free survival, 
and response rate in the intention-to-treat population 
and we analysed duration of response for all patients who 
had a best overall response of complete or partial 
response according to RECIST (version 1.1) by central 
review; we assessed safety in all patients who received at 
least one dose of study treatment. After one patient was 
allocated to and received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, it was 
found that their pre-baseline scans were not compliant 
with the protocol. The patient was permitted to remain 
on treatment and was included in the safety analysis 
population, but because it would not be possible to 
adequately assess tumour response, the patient was 
excluded from the eﬃ  cacy analysis population.
Statistical analysis
Because the lowest eﬀ ective dose and the relative merit of 
progression-free survival versus overall survival were 
unknown and the importance of PD-L1 staining was 
being validated when this study was designed, we 
assessed four primary outcomes at two doses. The 
two doses were selected on the basis of pharmacological 
models, and the statistical analysis plan appropriately 
accounted for the multiple endpoints. Two prespeciﬁ ed 
interim analyses were done by an unmasked statistician 
(appendix p 4). The data monitoring committee 
recommended continuing the study as planned after both 
interim analyses. This study was designed to show a 
diﬀ erence in overall survival in patients with a tumour 
proportion score of 50% or greater. Because we assumed 
that half of the total sample would have a tumour 
proportion score of 50% or greater, we believed that an 
overall survival beneﬁ t in this group would provide 
enough power to show a beneﬁ t for all primary endpoints. 
The ﬁ nal analysis was planned for when roughly 
200 deaths occurred across all treatment groups in 
patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or greater.

Assuming that overall survival follows an exponential 
distribution with an expected median of 9 months in the 
docetaxel group (based on previous studies), a hazard 
ratio (HR) of 0·60 between pem brolizumab and docetaxel, 
an enrolment period of 16 months, a minimum of 
8 months of follow-up after enrolment was complete to 
observe the required number of events, and a dropout 
rate of 2% over 12 months, we calculated that we would 
need to enrol 460 patients with a tumour proportion score 
of 50% or greater to provide at least 81% power to detect 
an HR of 0·55 for overall survival, with a one-sided α of 
0·00825 using the Hochberg procedure. We expected that 
roughly 920 patients would be enrolled in total and that 
550 patients would die by the ﬁ nal analysis, giving the 
study at least 80% power to detect an HR of 0·70 for 
overall survival in the total population. For the analysis of 
progression-free survival, we used a threshold of p<0·001 
for signiﬁ cance. The appendix (p 6) shows the multiplicity 
strategy we applied to the stratum of patients with a 
tumour proportion score of 50% or greater and to the 
overall population.
For overall survival, data for patients who were alive or 
lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last conﬁ rmed 
contact. For progression-free survival, data for patients 
who had not progressed or were lost to follow-up were 
censored at the time of last tumour assessment. For 
duration of response, data for patients whose response was 
ongoing at the time of the analysis or who discontinued 
the study without radiological evidence of progression 
were censored at the time of the last radiological 
assessment showing response, data for patients who had 
radiological disease progression after missing two 
radiological assessments were censored at the time of the 
last radiological assessment showing response, and data 
for patients who initiated new cancer treatment without 
radiological evidence of disease progression were censored 
at the time of starting their new treatment.
We did the statistical analyses using SAS (version 9.3). 
We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate overall 
survival, progression-free survival, and duration of 
response. We used the stratiﬁ ed log-rank test to assess 
treatment diﬀ erences in progression-free survival and 
overall survival; we used stratiﬁ ed Cox proportional 
hazard models with Efron’s method of tie handling to 
calculate HRs and associated 95% CIs.21 We compared 
response rate between treatment groups with the 
Miettinen and Nurminen method.22 All primary and 
subgroup analyses were stratiﬁ ed with the randomisation 
stratiﬁ cation factors.
This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT01905657.
Role of the funding source
The funder had a role in study design, analysis and 
interpretation of data, and the writing of the report. The 
funder maintained the study database. All authors had 
full access to the data and had responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Between Aug 28, 2013, and Feb 27, 2015, we screened 
2699 patients for enrolment. Of the 2222 patients whose 
tumour samples were assessable for PD-L1 expression, 
1475 (66%) had PD-L1 expression on at least 1% of 
tumour cells, including 633 (28%) with PD-L1 expression 
on at least 50% of tumour cells. 1034 (70%) of 1475 patients 
met the eligbility criteria and were enrolled in the study: 
345 allocated to pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg, 346 to 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg, and 343 to docetaxel (ﬁ gure 1). 
991 patients received at least one dose of assigned study 
drug: 339 in the 2 mg/kg group, 343 in the 10 mg/kg 
group, and 309 in the docetaxel group (ﬁ gure 1). At the 
cutoﬀ  date of Sept 30, 2015, median follow-up was 
13·1 months (IQR 8·6–17·7).
Baseline characteristics were as expected for patients 
with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer and were

balanced between groups (table 1). Most patients were 
current or former smokers, had tumours of non-
squamous histology, and had received one line of 
previous systemic treatment (table 1). Few patients had 
EGFR-mutant or ALK-translocated tumours. Baseline 
characteristics were similar in the 442 patients who had a 
PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% or greater 
(table 1).
At the time of data cutoﬀ , 521 patients had died: 
172 (50%) of 344 in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 
156 (45%) of 346 in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, 
and 193 (56%) of 343 in the docetaxel group. 204 patents 
with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 50% or greater 
died: 58 (42%) of 139 in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg 
group, 60 (40%) of 151 in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
group, and 86 (57%) of 152 in the docetaxel group. After 
discontinuation of study treatment, additional anti-
neoplastic treatment was received by 138 (40%) of 
344 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 
133 (38%) of 346 patients in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
group, and 151 (44%) of 343 patients in the docetaxel 
group, including two (1%), six (2%), and 45 (13%), 
respectively, who received other immunotherapies 
(appendix pp 8–9).
In patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 
50% or greater, the HR for overall survival for 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg versus docetaxel was 0·54 
(95% CI 0·38–0·77; p=0·0002), and for pembrolizumab 
10 mg/kg versus docetaxel it was 0·50 (0·36–0·70; 
p<0·0001). Median overall survival was 14·9 months 
(95% CI 10·4–not reached) for the pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg group, 17·3 months (11·8–not reached) for the 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 8·2 months 
(6·4–10·7) for the docetaxel group (ﬁ gure 2A).
In the total population, the HR for pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg versus docetaxel was 0·71 (95% CI 0·58–0·88; 
p=0·0008) and the HR for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
versus docetaxel was 0·61 (0·49–0·75; p<0·0001). Median 
overall survival was 10·4 months (95% CI 9·4–11·9) for 
the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 12·7 months 
(10·0–17·3) for the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 
8·5 months (95% CI, 7·5–9·8) for the docetaxel group 
(ﬁ gure 2B). 1-year overall survival was 43·2% versus 
52·3% versus 34·6%. Overall survival was similar in the 
two pembrolizumab groups both in patients with a PD-L1 
tumour proportion score of 50% or greater (HR for 
2 mg/kg vs 10 mg/kg 1·12, 95% CI 0·77–1·62) and in the 
total population (1·17, 0·94–1·45). Pembrolizumab 
provided beneﬁ t compared with docetaxel irrespective of 
whether archival or new tumour samples were used to 
assess PD-L1 expression. There was a signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t 
for patients with non-squamous disease. For those with 
squamous disease, the diﬀ erence was not statistically 
signiﬁ cant, but the data suggest a clinical beneﬁ t in this 
group also (ﬁ gure 3).
776 patients had died or had disease progression, 
including 266 (77%) of 344 in the pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg group, 254 (73%) of 346 in the pembrolizumab 
10 mg/kg group, and 256 (75%) of 343 in the docetaxel 
group. In patients with a tumour proportion score of 
50% or greater, 304 patients had a progression-free 
survival event (89 [64%] of 139, 97 [64%] of 151, and 118 
[78%] of 152, respectively). Progression-free survival was 
signiﬁ cantly longer with pembrolizumab than with 
docetaxel in patients with a tumour proportion score of 
50% or greater (ﬁ gure 4A), with an HR of 0·59 (95% CI 
0·44–0·78; p=0·0001) for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg 
versus doxetaxel and 0·59 (0·45–0·78; p<0·0001) for 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg versus docetaxel. Median 
progression-free survival was 5·0 months (95% CI 
4·0–6·5) in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 
5·2 months (4·1–8·1) in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
group, and 4·1 months (3·6–4·3) in the docetaxel group.
For the total population, progression-free survival did 
not meet the prespeciﬁ ed criterion for declaring statistical 
signiﬁ cance between pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 
doxetaxel (HR 0·88, 95% CI 0·74–1·05; p=0·07) or 
between pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and doxetaxel 
(HR 0·79, 0·66–0·94; p=0·004). Median progression-
free survival was 3·9 months (95% CI 3·1–4·1) in the 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 4·0 months (2·7–4·3) in 
the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 4·0 months 
(3·1–4·2) in the docetaxel group (ﬁ gure 4B). Progression-
free survival was similar for each pembrolizumab dose 
in patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or

greater (HR 1·01, 95% CI 0·75–1·36) and in the total 
population (1·09, 0·92–1·30). The eﬀ ect on progression-
free survival did not diﬀ er by tumour histology (ﬁ gure 5).
Among patients with a tumour proportion score of 
50% or greater, responses occurred in 42 (30%) of 
139 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 44 
(29%) of 151 in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 
12 (8%) of 152 in the docetaxel group (p<0·0001 for each 
pembrolizumab group vs docetaxel; appendix p 10). In 
the total population, 62 (18%) of 344 patients versus 
64 (18%) of 346 patients versus 32 (9%) of 343 had 
responses (p=0·0005 for 2 mg/kg vs docetaxel and 
p=0·0002 for 10 mg/kg vs docetaxel; appendix p 10). All 
responses were partial responses. Median time to 
response was 9 weeks in each treatment group (appendix 
p 10). Responses were longer in the pembrolizumab 
groups than in the docetaxel group (appendix p 7), with a 
median duration of response not reached for either 
pembrolizumab group compared with 8 months in the 
docetaxel group for patients with a tumour proportion 
score of ≥50% or greater and 6 months in the docetaxel 
group for all patients (appendix p 10).
In the safety population, the median duration of 
treatment was 3·5 months (IQR 1·4–7·2) in the 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 3·5 months (1·4–7·0) in 
the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 2·0 months 
(0·8–3·6) in the docetaxel group. Grade 3–5 adverse 
events attributed to study treatment occurred in 43 (13%) 
of 339 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg group, 
55 (16%) of 343 patients in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
group, and 109 (35%) of 309 patients in the docetaxel 
group (table 2). 15 (4%) of 339 patients, 17 (5%) of 
343 patients, and 31 (10%) of 309 patients, respectively, 
permanently discontinued study drug because of 
treatment-related adverse events. Deaths attributed to 
study treatment occurred in three patients in the 
pembrolizumab 
2 
mg/kg 
group 
(two 
cases 
of 
pneumonitis and one of pneumonia), three patients in 
the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg group (one case each of 
myocardial infarction, pneumonia, and pneumonitis), 
and ﬁ ve patients in the docetaxel group (one case each of 
acute cardiac failure, dehydration, febrile neutropenia, 
interstitial lung disease, and respiratory tract infection).
Adverse events were as expected for pembrolizumab 
and docetaxel (table 2, appendix pp 11–12). Adverse events 
of special interest based on their likely immune aetiology, 
irrespective of attribution to study treatment, occurred in 
69 (20%) of 339 patients in the pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg 
group and 64 (19%) of 343 patients in the pembrolizumab 
10 mg/kg group. The most common of these events were 
hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and pneumonitis 
(table 2). The only adverse events of special interest of 
grade 3–5 severity that occurred in 1% or more of patients 
were pneumonitis and severe skin reactions (table 2).
Discussion
Pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks met 
the prespeciﬁ ed criteria for improved overall survival in all 
patients 
(ie, 
PD-L1 
tumour 
proportion 
score 
of 1% or greater) and in those with a tumour proportion 
score of 50% or greater—patients with high PD-L1 
expression had an unprecedented beneﬁ t for refractory 
non-small-cell lung cancer. Both pembrolizumab groups 
had signiﬁ cantly improved progression-free survival in 
patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or greater, 
and although the prespeciﬁ ed criterion for declaring 
statistical signiﬁ cance was not met, progression-free 
survival was longer with pembrolizumab than with 
docetaxel for the total population. Responses to 
pembrolizumab were durable, regardless of PD-L1 
expression level. Pembrolizumab was associated with 
fewer high-grade treatment-related adverse events than 
was docetaxel, despite a longer exposure. Immune-
mediated adverse events, including pneumonitis, occurred 
at manageable rates, although three (<1%) of 682 patients 
treated with pembrolizumab died because of pneumonitis.

Median overall survival with docetaxel seemed to be 
consistent with that previously reported (9 months),23 
and there was no diﬀ erence in survival with docetaxel 
among patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score of 
50% or greater or in the total population. Consistent with 
KEYNOTE-001,9 pembrolizumab eﬃ  cacy was greater in 
patients with a tumour proportion score of 50% or 
greater than in the overall population. Progression-free 
survival with pembrolizumab was superior to that of 
docetaxel in patients with a tumour proportion score of 
50% or greater, but not in the total population. However, 
overall survival with pembrolizumab was superior to that 
of docetaxel in both tumour proportion score strata, 
suggesting that progression-free survival might not 
appropriately capture the true beneﬁ t of pembrolizumab. 
The lack of a beneﬁ t for progression-free survival despite 
a signiﬁ cant overall survival beneﬁ t was also reported in 
the CheckMate 057 study of nivolumab versus docetaxel 
for non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.8
Few patients assigned to pembrolizumab withdrew 
consent, whereas the incidence in the docetaxel group 
was higher than what is typical in a phase 3 trial. Many of 
the patients allocated to docetaxel who withdrew consent 
probably did so to seek anti-PD-1 treatment. A similarly 
high percentage of patients in the CheckMate 057 trial 
who were assigned to docetaxel did not receive it (22 [8%] 
of 290).8 This ﬁ nding is not surprising given the many 
other studies of PD-1 inhibitors for non-small-cell lung 
cancer that were ongoing during KEYNOTE-010. Patients 
who withdrew and subsequently received another 
immunotherapy could aﬀ ect overall survival. However, 
any bias of this unplanned crossover would likely favour 
the docetaxel group. Therefore, the high dropout rate in 
the docetaxel group does not diminish our conﬁ dence in 
the signiﬁ cant survival beneﬁ t for pembrolizumab. 
Another limitation of this study is the incidence of EGFR 
mutation or ALK translocation, which was lower than 
would be expected in the general non-small-cell lung 
cancer population. Finally, because we excluded patients 
with no PD-L1 tumour expression, we could not do 
statistically meaningful analyses of the interaction 
between PD-L1 expression and outcome by treatment 
allocation.
Our results contribute to the growing evidence that 
supports PD-1 pathway inhibition in non-small-cell lung 
cancer.7,8,10,11,24 Although reports of treatment with 
pembrolizumab and nivolumab have shown a survival 
beneﬁ t for PD-1 inhibition, several aspects of 
KEYNOTE-010 diﬀ erentiate it from the CheckMate 017 
and CheckMate 057 studies of nivolumab.7,8 Whereas 
there were separate nivolumab studies for squamous7 
and non-squamous8 histology, KEYNOTE-010 enrolled 
patients regardless of histology. Our data suggest that, 
like nivolumab, pembrolizumab provides beneﬁ t for 
squamous and non-squamous non-small-cell lung 
cancer (although the diﬀ erence for squamous cell 
disease was not statistically signiﬁ cant, probably partly 
because of the small population size). In addition, 
whereas both CheckMate studies limited enrolment to 
patients who received only one line of previous 
treatment for metastatic disease, almost one-third of 
patients in KEYNOTE-010 received at least two lines of 
previous treatment.
Our data are the ﬁ rst reported for lung cancer 
prospectively showing the utility of PD-L1 as a biomarker; 
all patients derived a survival beneﬁ t from pembro-
lizumab. This ﬁ nding contrasts with the ﬁ ndings of 
studies of unselected populations. The assay used in 
KEYNOTE-010 was rigorously evaluated and validated 
before the study began9 and has been approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration as a companion 
diagnostic test. Our data indicate that assessment of 
PD-L1 in archival samples with this assay is appropriate 
because pembrolizumab provided superior overall 
survival regardless of the age of the sample. Among 
patients with evaluable samples screened for enrolment 
in our study, two-thirds had a PD-L1 tumour proportion 
score of 1% or greater, and more than a quarter had a 
score of 50% or greater. The higher proportion of patients 
with a score of 50% or greater in the enrolled population 
(43%) was a result of the exclusion of patients with 
PD-L1-negative tumours. Whether the beneﬁ t of 
pembrolizumab extends to patients with a tumour 
proportion score of less than 1% will require additional 
study. Ongoing studies are assessing pembrolizumab as

and 
as 
adjuvant therapy (PEARLS, ClinicalTrials.gov number 
NCT02504372). These studies are enrolling patients 
using diﬀ erent biomarker cutpoints, and we await the 
ﬁ nal analyses to determine which cutpoint best predicts 
the eﬀ ectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
these earlier lines of therapy. For those patients for whom 
pembrolizumab monotherapy is not as eﬀ ective as 
cytotoxic 
chemotherapy, 
combinations 
with 
chemotherapy25 or other immunotherapies26 might be 
needed. To augment patient identiﬁ cation based on 
PD-L1 expression, which may be limited by tumour 
heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of the immune 
microenvironment,27,28 other checkpoint molecules,29 
tumour inﬁ ltrating cells,30 mutational load,31 blood-based 
immune 
biomarkers,10 
and 
inﬂ ammatory 
gene 
signatures32,33 could be explored. Additional studies will 
also be needed to determine the optimal duration of 
therapy for pembrolizumab and other anti-PD-1 drugs.
Our ﬁ ndings validate pembrolizumab as a new 
treatment option for patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer who have received one or more previous 
treatment regimen and who have a tumour proportion 
score of at least 1%. These data also support the use of a 
dose of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks and validate the use of 
PD-L1 selection in this population.
