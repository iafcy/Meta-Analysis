Background: Ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, demonstrated survival beneﬁt in melanoma with
immune-related (ir) adverse events (irAEs) managed by the protocol-deﬁned guidelines. This phase 2 study evaluated
ipilimumab + paclitaxel (Taxol)/carboplatin in extensive-disease-small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC).
Design: Patients (n = 130) with chemotherapy-naïve ED-SCLC were randomized 1: 1: 1 to receive paclitaxel (175 mg/
m2)/carboplatin (area under the curve = 6) with either placebo (control) or ipilimumab 10 mg/kg in two alternative
regimens, concurrent ipilimumab (ipilimumab + paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by placebo + paclitaxel/carboplatin) or
phased ipilimumab (placebo + paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by ipilimumab + paclitaxel/carboplatin). Treatment was
administered every 3 weeks for a maximum of 18 weeks (induction), followed by maintenance ipilimumab or placebo
every 12 weeks. End points included progression-free survival (PFS), irPFS, best overall response rate (BORR); irBORR,
overall survival (OS), and safety.
Results: Phased ipilimumab, but not concurrent ipilimumab, improved irPFS versus control [HR (hazard ratio) = 0.64;
P = 0.03]. No improvement in PFS (HR = 0.93; P = 0.37) or OS (HR = 0.75; P = 0.13) occurred. Phased ipilimumab,
concurrent ipilimumab and control, respectively, were associated with median irPFS of 6.4, 5.7 and 5.3 months;
median PFS of 5.2, 3.9 and 5.2 months; median OS of 12.9, 9.1 and 9.9 months. Overall rates of grade 3/4 irAEs were
17, 21 and 9% for phased ipilimumab, concurrent ipilimumab and control, respectively.
Conclusion: These results suggest further investigation of ipilimumab in ED-SCLC.

introduction
Combination chemotherapies are the current standard of care
for extensive-disease-small-cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC) [1, 2].
Despite high initial tumor responses to these therapies,
recurrence occurs rapidly with median overall survival (OS)
ranging from 8 to 11 months [1, 3]. Phase 3 trials over the past
30 years evaluating the combinations of cisplatin or carboplatin
with different third generation cytotoxic agents as ﬁrst-line
treatment have shown no incremental improvement in OS
[1, 3], underscoring the need for novel treatment strategies.
Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a negative
regulator of T-cell activation, is an anticancer target of current
interest [4–7]. Ipilimumab, a fully human anti-CTLA-4
monoclonal antibody, blocks the interaction of CTLA-4 with
its ligands (CD80/CD86). This blockade augments T-cell
activation and proliferation, leading to tumor inﬁltration by T-
cells and tumor regression [8–14]. Early clinical trials with
ipilimumab have shown durable tumor responses in multiple
cancer types [15–18]. Two phase 3 studies have demonstrated
ipilimumab as the ﬁrst agent to signiﬁcantly improve OS in
patients with metastatic melanoma [19, 20]. Adverse events

(AEs) occurring in ≥15% of patients included pruritus, rash
and diarrhea, and most AEs were managed by the drug-
speciﬁc treatment guidelines [19, 20].
SCLC patients with immune-mediated Lambert-Eaton
myasthenic syndrome appeared to stay longer in limited
disease state and have improved survival [21]. Long-term
survivors of SCLC were found to have a higher ratio of
antitumor effectors T cells to regulatory T cells compared with
those who had recurrent disease [22]. These observations
suggest that agents such as ipilimumab that act by promoting
antitumor immunity may delay tumor growth in patients with
SCLC. This randomized phase 2 study was undertaken to
evaluate the activity of ipilimumab in combination with
paclitaxel/carboplatin versus paclitaxel/carboplatin alone in
patients with ED-SCLC. The rationale for combining
ipilimumab with chemotherapy was based on preclinical
studies showing that chemotherapeutics induce the release of
tumor-speciﬁc antigens initiating T-cell activation and sensitize
tumor cells to T-cell-mediated killing [23–29], and that certain
chemotherapeutics enhance the antitumor activity of an anti-
CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody [30, 31].
Paclitaxel/carboplatin was chosen as comparator in this
study, because this combination is a common standard of care
for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, the larger of
the two cohorts in this trial [32, 33], and also because the
long-term efﬁcacy of paclitaxel/carboplatin in ED-SCLC was
comparable with that of cisplatin/etoposide, the commonly
used chemotherapy combination in ED-SCLC [3, 34, 35].
Since the timing of chemotherapy administration relative to
immunotherapy has been shown to affect outcome [29, 36, 37],
ipilimumab was combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel using
two alternate regimens. In the concurrent regimen, ipilimumab
was administered concurrently with paclitaxel/carboplatin,
allowing ipilimumab to be present at the earliest phase of
chemotherapy-induced antigen release. In the phased regimen,
paclitaxel/carboplatin alone was administered followed by
ipilimumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin, allowing for antigen release
to occur before ipilimumab exposure.
The study enrolled patients with ED-SCLC as well as those
with advanced NSCLC, and was designed to analyze each
cohort separately. Results for the ED-SCLC cohort are
presented here. The NSCLC cohort is reported elsewhere [38].
patients and methods
study design and treatment
In this international, randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase 2 study,
334 patients were stratiﬁed by disease type (ED-SCLC, n = 130; NSCLC,
n = 204) and study site. Patients in each stratum were randomized 1: 1: 1 to
receive either concurrent-ipilimumab regimen (four doses of ipilimumab/
paclitaxel (Taxol)/carboplatin followed by two doses of placebo/paclitaxel/
carboplatin); phased-ipilimumab regimen (two doses of placebo/paclitaxel/
carboplatin followed by four doses of ipilimumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin);
or control regimen (up to six doses of placebo/paclitaxel/carboplatin).
Ipilimumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) and carboplatin
(area under the curve = 6) were administered intravenously once every
3 weeks for a maximum of 18 weeks during the induction phase, starting
on day 1; the paclitaxel dose was chosen based on a phase 2 study showing
that the response rate and survival with 175 mg/m2 did not differ
signiﬁcantly from those with 225 mg/m2, with 175 mg/m2 showing better
safety [32]. Patients without progression who continued to tolerate
treatment received either ipilimumab (phased- and concurrent-ipilimumab
arms) or placebo (control arm) once every 12 weeks as maintenance until
progression, death or intolerance.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the ethics committee at each
participating center. All patients provided written informed consent before
enrollment (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer: NCT 00527735).
patients
This report focuses on the ED-SCLC cohort. Eligible patients had
histologically or cytologically conﬁrmed ED-SCLC with bidimensionally
measurable lesions, were ≥18 years of age, received no prior systemic
therapy for lung cancer and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1. Key exclusion criteria included: prior
treatment with CD137 agonist or CTLA-4 modulators; uncontrolled
malignant pleural effusion; brain metastases; prior or current
paraneoplastic syndromes related to SCLC; current malignancies or
previous malignancies within 5 years; autoimmune disease; ≥grade
2 peripheral neuropathy; inadequate hematologic, hepatic or renal function;
chronic use of immunosuppressive agents and/or systemic corticosteroids
(except when used as premedication for paclitaxel infusion or for the
management of toxic effect).
assessments
Tumor assessments using radiologic imaging were carried out at screening
and every 6 weeks during the induction phase and every 12 weeks in the
maintenance phase. A blinded Independent Radiologic Review Committee
assessed tumor response using both modiﬁed World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria (mWHO) and newly proposed immune-related (ir)
response criteria (irRC) [39, 40]. The irRC represents a modiﬁcation of
mWHO to capture the unique tumor response patterns to ipilimumab that
include regression of index lesions in the face of new lesions and initial
progression (mWHO) followed by tumor stabilization or decrease in tumor
burden [40]. To account for these patterns, the irRC used total tumor
burden obtained by adding index lesions and measurable new lesions in
determining tumor response; changes in non-index or non-measurable
lesions were not considered. ir responses were deﬁned as follows: ir-
complete response (irCR), complete disappearance of all lesions; ir-partial
response (irPR), ≥50% decrease of total tumor burden from baseline ir
progressive disease (irPD), ≥25% increase of total tumor burden from
nadir and ir-stable disease (irSD), all other settings including a slow steady
decline in total tumor burden from baseline. Details of the irRC are
described elsewhere [40]. Responses by both irRC and mWHO criteria
were conﬁrmed by two evaluations at least 4 weeks apart. Assessments were
performed until investigator-documented progression or unacceptable toxic
effect. Patients without progression who discontinued the treatment of
toxic effect were followed until they received alternative therapy or
withdrew consent.
Clinical laboratory parameters, AEs and irAEs were assessed at each
dosing cycle and at the end of treatment. irAE was deﬁned as an AE that
was treatment-related and consistent with an immune-mediated event. AEs
and irAEs were monitored for at least 70 days after the last dose of study
drugs or until any ongoing event resolved or stabilized. AEs, irAEs and
laboratory values were graded according to the National Cancer Institute
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
The guidelines for the management of irAEs included the
administration of corticosteroids (orally or intravenously), a delay in a
scheduled dose, or discontinuation of therapy. No dose reductions were

allowed for ipilimumab. Ipilimumab dosing was skipped in the case of
≥grade 2 non-dermatologic AEs, ≥grade 3 dermatologic AEs or ≥grade
3 hematologic abnormalities, until the event improved to ≤grade 1; if the
event did not improve to ≤grade 1, treatment was discontinued
permanently. Dose modiﬁcations for paclitaxel and carboplatin were made
according to the package inserts/product label [41, 42]. Discontinuation or
interruption of one agent did not preclude continuation of the remainder.
statistical considerations
Efﬁcacy parameters were analyzed in all randomized patients using SAS
8.0. Safety analyses included patients who received at least one dose of any
study drug. Primary end point for this study was immune-related
progression-free survival (irPFS, time from randomization to irPD or
death) in the NSCLC cohort [38]. Efﬁcacy end points prespeciﬁed for the
ED-SCLC cohort were all secondary and included irPFS, mWHO-PFS (the
time from randomization to PD per mWHO), OS (time from
randomization to death), mWHO-best overall response rate (mWHO-
BORR, proportion of patients with CR or PR per mWHO), irBORR
(proportion of patients with irCR or irPR), mWHO-disease control rate
(mWHO-DCR, proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD per mWHO)
and irDCR (proportion of patients with irCR, irPR or irSD).
Assuming an exponential distribution for irPFS, it was estimated that
86 events of 120 randomized ED-SCLC patients among three arms
would provide 74% power to detect a difference in irPFS [hazard ratio
(HR), 0.6; median for control, 4.5 months] with one-sided α of 0.1.
Likewise, 57 deaths would provide 57% power to detect a difference in
OS (HR, 0.74; median for control, 10 months). irPFS, mWHO-PFS and
OS were compared between each ipilimumab arm and the control arm
using an unstratiﬁed log-rank test with one-sided α of 0.1. No
multiplicity adjustments to α were made. No analysis by study site was
conducted. irPFS, mWHO-PFS and OS were estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier product limit method; 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for
medians were calculated according to Brookmeyer and Crowley [43].
HRs with 95% CIs were estimated for irPFS, mWHO-PFS and OS using
an unstratiﬁed Cox proportional hazards model. irBORR, BORR, irDCR
and DCR were estimated, and 95% CIs were computed according to
Clopper and Pearson [44]. All 95% CIs were two-sided. The patient
follow-up continued beyond the initial database lock for an updated OS
analysis.

randomized to either control regimen (up to six doses of placebo/paclitaxel/carboplatin), concurrent-ipilimumab regimen (four doses of ipilimumab/
paclitaxel/carboplatin followed by two doses of placebo/paclitaxel/carboplatin), or phased-ipilimumab regimen (two doses of placebo/paclitaxel/carboplatin
followed by four doses of ipilimumab/paclitaxel/carboplatin). Patients who discontinued treatment may have differentially discontinued one or more study
therapy and may have received paclitaxel and/or carboplatin as subsequent therapy. ‘Completed induction phase’ indicates that a patient completed
induction phase without entering maintenance phase. The disposition of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in this study can be found (Lynch

patient disposition and characteristics
One hundred and thirty patients with previously untreated
ED-SCLC were randomized between June 2008 and August
2009 in 32 centers across seven countries, and all but two
patients (reasons not reported) were treated (Figure 1). The
initial database lock took place on 27 August 2010 with a
minimum follow-up of 11.1 months. At this lock, all patients,
except for two in the concurrent-ipilimumab and one in the
control arms, were off treatment. The main reason for
treatment discontinuation was disease progression. As shown
in supplementary Table S1, available at Annals of Oncology
online, baseline demographics and disease characteristics were
generally balanced across arms, except for patients aged over
65 years (control, 20%; concurrent-ipilimumab arm, 19%;
phased-ipilimumab arm, 31%), and patients with elevated
lactate dehydrogenase levels (control, 42%; concurrent
ipilimumab, 58%; phased ipilimumab, 48%).
treatment exposure
The median number of ipilimumab doses administered over
the entire treatment period (induction plus maintenance) was
four in both the concurrent-ipilimumab (range, 1–12 doses)
and phased-ipilimumab (1–7 doses) arms. Each ipilimumab-
containing arm had 12 patients (29%) receiving ﬁve or more
doses of ipilimumab. The median number of paclitaxel doses
administered was ﬁve in the concurrent-ipilimumab (range, 1–
6) and six in both the phased-ipilimumab (range, 2–6) and
control (range, 1–6) arms. The median number of carboplatin
doses given was six in both the control (range, 1–6) and
phased-ipilimumab (range, 2–6) arms, and ﬁve in the
Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier plots for progression-free survival (PFS) per immune-related (ir) response criteria (irPFS). To account for the unique tumor
response patterns to ipilimumab, immune-related response criteria (irRC) was proposed. Per irRC, new lesions, whether measurable or not, were not
considered progression. Measurable new lesions were rather added to the index lesions to obtain total tumor burden, and a ≥25% reduction in this total
tumor burden from nadir was deﬁned as immune-related progression. irPFS was deﬁned as the time from the randomization to immune-related progression
[as determined by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRRC)] or death. As indicated by symbols, patients who neither progressed nor died were
censored on the date of last tumor assessment. P-values are based on an unstratiﬁed log-rank test with a one-sided α of 0.1.

concurrent-ipilimumab arm (range, 1–6). The number of
patients entering the maintenance phase was 14 (32%) in the
control, 12 (29%) in the concurrent-ipilimumab and 15 (36%)
in the phased-ipilimumab arms. The median number of
ipilimumab doses received in the maintenance phase was 1.5
(range, 1–8) for concurrent-ipilimumab and 1 (range, 1–3) for
phased-ipilimumab arms, with the median number of placebo
in the control arm being 1 (range, 1–5).
efﬁcacy
Progression was assessed using both the irRC criteria (see
Patients and Methods) and modiﬁed WHO criteria. The
phased-ipilimumab regimen improved irPFS compared with
control (HR, 0.64; P = 0.03, Figure 2), while the concurrent-
ipilimumab regimen did not (HR, 0.75; P = 0.11). Median
irPFS was 5.3 months for control, 6.4 months for phased-
ipilimumab and 5.7 months for concurrent-ipilimumab
regimens (Figure 2). mWHO-PFS was similar across arms with
the medians being 5.2 months for control, 5.2 months for
phased ipilimumab and 3.9 months for concurrent ipilimumab
(Figure 3).
At the initial analysis (data cut-off; 27 August 2010) with 99
deaths (76%) reported, median OS for phased ipilimumab was
12.9 months, an increase of 3.0 months over the median of 9.9
months for control (HR, 0.75; P = 0.13; Figure 4). Median OS
for concurrent ipilimumab was 9.1 months. In a follow-up OS
analysis with 114 deaths (88%) reported (data cut-off: 5
January 2011), median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI, 8.6–11.7)
for control, 12.5 months (95% CI, 7.9–14.9) for phased
ipilimumab and 9.1 months (95% CI, 6.7–13.0) for concurrent
ipilimumab. The HR values relative to control were 0.76 (95%
CI, 0.48–1.19) for phased ipilimumab and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.57–
1.39) for concurrent ipilimumab.
Tumor response rates appeared to favor phased ipilimumab,
but not concurrent ipilimumab, over control, the differences
being greater when assessed by irRC (Table 1). irBORR was

53% for control, 49% for concurrent ipilimumab (including
one irCR) and 71% for phased ipilimumab; corresponding
mWHO-BORRs were 49, 33 (including one CR) and 57%,
respectively (Table 1). irDCRs for control, concurrent-
ipilimumab and phased-ipilimumab regimens were 96, 81 and
93%, respectively. Corresponding mWHO-DCRs were 93, 70
and 81%, respectively. In the control arm, response rates by
irRC were similar to those by mWHO criteria.
safety
As shown in Table 2, the overall incidence of treatment-related
grade 3/4 AEs appeared more common in ipilimumab-
containing arms (concurrent, 43%; phased, 50%) than in the
control arm (30%). However, rates of AE-related
discontinuation were similar across arms (control, 9%;
concurrent, 7%; phased, 5%; Figure 1).
Some of the most common non-hematologic AEs (≥15%,
any grade), including fatigue, alopecia, nausea and peripheral
sensory neuropathy, were generally similar across arms in
terms of frequency and severity. The other common AEs
including rash, pruritus and diarrhea occurred more frequently
in the ipilimumab-containing arms compared with control,
and these AEs were also identiﬁed as irAEs per protocol-
deﬁned criteria. As shown in Table 2, hematologic
abnormalities (any grades) were generally similar across arms,
although grade 3/4 abnormalities appeared more frequent in
the ipilimumab-containing arms versus control (7–10% versus
2%).
The overall incidence of grade 3/4 irAEs was 9% for control,
21% for concurrent ipilimumab and 17% for phased
ipilimumab. There were no grade 4 events of rash or pruritus.
All events of severe diarrhea were grade 3, except for one grade
4 event for concurrent ipilimumab. One occurrence of grade 3
colitis was recorded for phased ipilimumab. There were four
cases of grade 3 arthralgia for phased ipilimumab. Grade 3/4
increases in alanine aminotransferase were noted in seven
patients (grade 3 six, grade 4 one) for concurrent ipilimumab,
two patients (grade 3 one, grade 4 one) for phased ipilimumab
and none for control. The corresponding values for aspartate
aminotransferase were ﬁve patients (grade 3 four, grade 4 one),
three patients (all grade 3) and none, respectively. There were
two cases of grade 4 hepatitis, one (2%) in each ipilimumab-
containing arm. There was no occurrence of hypophysitis,
although one grade 3 event of decreased visual acuity was
reported for phased ipilimumab. One death in the concurrent-
ipilimumab arm was attributed to treatment-related
hepatotoxicity.
discussion
This ﬁrst study of ipilimumab in patients with ED-SCLC
showed that the phased-ipilimumab regimen prolonged OS
numerically compared with paclitaxel/carboplatin alone
(median, 12.9 versus 9.9 months; HR, 0.75; P = 0.13). There
was improvement in irPFS (HR, 0.64; P = 0.03) but not in
mWHO-PFS (HR, 0.93; P = 0.37). The response data based on
the newly proposed irRC criteria, which have yet to be
validated, do not allow ﬁrm conclusions and must be
considered hypothesis generating. Retrospective analysis of
data from phase 2 studies in patients with metastatic

melanoma suggests that the irRC may better capture the
activity of ipilimumab than the WHO criteria [18, 40, 45]. Two
ongoing phase 3 trials of ipilimumab in lung cancer
(ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁers: NCT01285609 and
NCT01450761) will evaluate prospectively if irPFS may better
correlate with OS than mWHO-PFS.
No improvements in efﬁcacy end points studied including
irPFS, mWHO-PFS, OS and tumor response were noted with
concurrent ipilimumab. While factors contributing to the
activity seen with phased ipilimumab are unknown, it is
interesting to speculate that the exposure to chemotherapy
before ipilimumab may have contributed to the enhancement
of antitumor immune response by ipilimumab. Studies in
preclinical tumor models and in patients suggest that
sequencing of chemotherapy and immunotherapy may affect
clinical outcome [36, 37, 46].
The common AEs seen during the study that are typically
associated with paclitaxel/carboplatin, including alopecia,
fatigue, nausea and peripheral neuropathy, were generally
unaffected by the addition of ipilimumab. Consistent with
previous experience from other studies [20, 21], the most
common irAEs involved skin (rash and pruritus) and
gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea), and occurred more frequently
in the ipilimumab-containing arms. Treatment-related AEs,
irAEs and laboratory abnormalities were mostly grade 1/2.
Overall rates of treatment-related grade 3/4 AEs appeared
higher for ipilimumab-containing regimens compared with the
control, as were the occurrence of alanine aminotransferase
and aspartate aminotransferase elevations. Most grade 3/4
irAEs were managed by the protocol-speciﬁed treatment
guidelines including close patient follow-up and the early
administration of systemic corticosteroids [21, 47]. Overall, in
this phase 2 trial, the combination of ipilimumab plus
paclitaxel/carboplatin exhibited an acceptable safety proﬁle in
ED-SCLC patients.
A major limitation of this analysis is small study population,
although given the relative rarity of ED-SCLC, the population
(n = 130) studied here is a large series. The fact that irRC has
not yet been validated warrants caution in interpreting the
irRC-based data described here. While irRC appeared to have
captured the unique patterns of ipilimumab’s tumor response
in this patient cohort, only 8 of the 28 patients who had PD
(mWHO) without irPD were followed until irPD, precluding a
full assessment of immune-related responses. An additional
limitation is the use of paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Princeton, New Jersey)/carboplatin as comparator, because
combinations of cisplatin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton,
New Jersey) or carboplatin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton,
New Jersey) with etoposide (Gensia Sicor Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., Irvine, California) are the most commonly used standard
of care for SCLC. While, at the time this study was designed,
preclinical data were available only for the combination of
ipilimumab and paclitaxel, subsequent preclinical studies
showed synergy between etoposide and ipilimumab [30].
In conclusion, ipilimumab in combination with paclitaxel/
carboplatin appeared to show clinical activity in patients with
previously untreated ED-SCLC when administered as phased
but not as concurrent regimen. Clinical activity with the
phased regimen was also reported in the NSCLC cohort of this
study [38]. Ipilimumab did not appear to exacerbate toxic
effects observed with paclitaxel/carboplatin alone, and the
proﬁle of irAEs was consistent with previous experience from
other ipilimumab studies. A phase 3 trial (NCT01450761)
comparing phased ipilimumab plus etoposide/platinum
therapy with etoposide/platinum therapy alone in patients with
newly diagnosed ED-SCLC is underway.
