BACKGROUND
Enhancing tumor-specific T-cell immunity by inhibiting programmed death ligand 1 
(PD-L1)–programmed death 1 (PD-1) signaling has shown promise in the treat-
ment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Combining checkpoint inhibition 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy may have a synergistic effect and improve efficacy.
METHODS
We conducted this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate atezo­
lizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell 
lung cancer who had not previously received treatment. Patients were randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive carboplatin and etoposide with either atezoliz­
umab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a mainte-
nance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo (according 
to the previous random assignment) until they had unacceptable toxic effects, 
disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, 
version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary end points were 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-
to-treat population.
RESULTS
A total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202 
patients to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median 
overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in 
the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 
to 0.91; P = 0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3 
months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02). The safety profile of atezolizumab plus carboplatin and 
etoposide was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the indi-
vidual agents, with no new findings observed.
CONCLUSIONS
The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of exten-
sive-stage small-cell lung cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival 
and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone. (Funded by F. Hoffmann–
La Roche/Genentech; IMpower133 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02763579.)

tandard-of-care first-line treat-
ment for extensive-stage small-cell lung 
cancer is platinum chemotherapy (carbo-
platin or cisplatin) with etoposide.1-3 Despite re-
sponse rates of 60 to 65%, limited progress has 
been made in more than two decades; outcomes 
remain poor, with a median overall survival of 
approximately 10 months.3,4 Small-cell lung can-
cer has a high mutation rate, which suggests that 
these tumors may be immunogenic and could 
respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors.5-7 
Adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy may 
enhance antitumor immunity and improve out-
comes beyond those achieved with our current 
therapeutic armamentarium. Clinical activity of 
immunotherapies has been observed in patients 
with refractory or metastatic small-cell lung 
cancer 8-12; however, a phase 2 single-group study 
of maintenance pembrolizumab and a phase 3 
study of ipilimumab plus chemotherapy showed 
no improved efficacy in the first-line treatment 
of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.12,13
Atezolizumab (Tecentriq, F. Hoffmann–La 
Roche/Genentech) is a humanized monoclonal 
anti–programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) anti-
body that inhibits PD-L1–programmed death 1 
(PD-1) and PD-L1–B7-1 signaling and restores 
tumor-specific T-cell immunity.14,15 In a phase 1 
trial, atezolizumab monotherapy had an accept-
able side-effect and safety profile, with promising 
durability of response in patients with relapsed 
or refractory small-cell lung cancer.10
The IMpower133 trial evaluated the efficacy 
and safety of adding atezolizumab or placebo to 
first-line treatment with carboplatin and etopo-
side in patients with extensive-stage small-cell 
lung cancer. We report a planned interim analy-
sis of overall survival and a final analysis of 
progression-free survival.
Methods
Trial Oversight
F. Hoffmann–La Roche/Genentech sponsored the 
IMpower133 trial, provided the trial drugs, and 
collaborated with the academic authors on the 
design of the trial and on the collection, analy-
sis, and interpretation of the data. The trial was 
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines and the provisions of the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided 
written informed consent. An independent data 
and safety monitoring committee reviewed safety 
data regularly. Protocol approval was obtained 
from an independent ethics committee at each 
site. The protocol is available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org. An author who is an 
employee of F. Hoffmann–La Roche and an au-
thor who is an employee of Genentech analyzed 
the data. All the authors vouch for the accuracy 
and completeness of the data and for the fidelity 
of the trial to the protocol. All drafts of the 
manuscript were prepared by the authors, with 
editorial and writing assistance funded by the 
sponsor.
Patients
Eligible patients were adults with histologically or 
cytologically confirmed extensive-stage small-cell 
lung cancer as defined according to the Veterans 
Administration Lung Study Group staging sys-
tem (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, 
available at NEJM.org),16 measurable extensive-
stage small-cell lung cancer according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
version 1.1, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncol-
ogy Group (ECOG) performance-status score of 
0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with higher numbers 
reflecting greater disability) who had not received 
previous systemic treatment for extensive-stage 
small-cell lung cancer. Patients with treated asymp-
tomatic central nervous system metastases were 
eligible (see the Supplementary Methods section 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Key exclusion 
criteria were a history of autoimmune disease 
and previous treatment with CD137 agonists or 
immune-checkpoint blockade therapies.
Trial Design and Interventions
The IMpower133 trial is a multinational, phase 1 
(safety) and phase 3 (efficacy), double-blind, ran-
domized, placebo-controlled trial. Enrolled pa-
tients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive, in 
the induction phase, four 21-day cycles of carbo-
platin (area under the curve of 5 mg per milli-
liter per minute, administered intravenously on 
day 1 of each cycle) and etoposide (100 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area, administered 
intravenously on days 1 through 3 of each cycle) 
with either atezolizumab (at a dose of 1200 mg, 
administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle) 
or placebo (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). The induction phase was followed by a main-
tenance phase during which patients received

First-Line Atezolizumab in Extensive-Stage SCLC
either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the 
previous random assignment) until the occur-
rence of unacceptable toxic effects or disease 
progression according to RECIST. Continuation 
of the trial regimen after the occurrence of dis-
ease progression during either phase was allowed 
if evidence of clinical benefit existed (see the 
Supplementary Methods section in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). During the maintenance 
phase, prophylactic cranial irradiation was per-
mitted, but thoracic radiation therapy was not. 
Randomization was performed with the use of a 
permuted-block randomization method (IxRS) 
and was stratified according to sex, ECOG per-
formance-status score (0 or 1), and presence of 
brain metastases (yes or no). PD-L1 testing was 
not performed during screening owing to the 
expected high rate of inadequate sample types 
(e.g., fine-needle aspirates, bronchoscopy find-
ings), the low prevalence of PD-L1 expression on 
tumor cells, and the lack of an association be-
tween response and PD-L1 expression in the 
phase 1 trial of atezolizumab in extensive-stage 
small-cell lung cancer.8-10,17,18
Phase 1 of the trial was a safety run-in period 
to establish the side-effect and adverse-event pro-
file of the treatment regimens; during this phase, 
a minimum of 12 patients were assigned to each 
group and received at least two cycles of treat-
ment. Trial treatments were administered at full 
dose according to the protocol. Unblinded safety 
data were reviewed by an independent data and 
safety monitoring committee for assessment of 
the side-effect profile; on the basis of the find-
ings of the committee, the trial continued as a 
randomized phase 3 trial.
End Points and Assessments
The primary end points were overall survival (the 
time from randomization to death from any 
cause) and investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival (the time from randomization to disease 
progression according to RECIST or death from 
any cause, whichever occurred first) in the inten-
tion-to-treat population. Key secondary end points 
included investigator-assessed objective response 
rate (according to RECIST) and the duration of 
response. Confirmation of responses was not 
required per protocol, but confirmed response 
rates were reported in the interest of rigor and 
to protect against potential bias. The estimated 
rate of overall survival at 1 year was evaluated. 
Exploratory analyses included the assessment of 
efficacy according to tumor mutational burden. 
Assessments of tumor mutational burden were 
performed with the use of a blood-based assay 
(blood-based tumor mutational burden), as re-
ported previously.19
Tumor assessments were conducted at screen-
ing, every 6 weeks for the first 48 weeks starting 
from day 1 of cycle 1, and every 9 weeks there-
after until the occurrence of disease progression 
according to RECIST. Patients who continued 
the trial regimen beyond disease progression 
continued to undergo tumor assessments every 
6 weeks until the regimen was discontinued. Ad-
verse events were assessed according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events, version 4.0. The investigators 
determined whether adverse events were related 
to the trial regimen.
Statistical Analysis
The primary end points were assessed in the 
intention-to-treat population and were analyzed 
according to the assigned treatment, regardless 
of the actual treatment received. For the analysis 
of progression-free survival, data for patients who 
were alive and had no disease progression were 
censored at the time of the last tumor assess-
ment. For the analysis of overall survival, data 
for patients who were alive were censored at the 
time of the last contact.
To control the overall two-sided type I error 
rate of 0.05, a group-sequential weighted Holm 
procedure20,21 was used wherein the two-sided 
significance levels of 0.005 and 0.045 were allo-
cated to the primary comparisons for progression-
free survival and overall survival, respectively. The 
test that was significant could pass its alpha 
level to the test that was not statistically signifi-
cant at the original allocated alpha level.
The sample size of the trial was determined 
by the analysis of overall survival. We calculated 
that 306 deaths in the intention-to-treat popula-
tion would be needed to provide 91% power at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.045 to detect 
a hazard ratio for death with atezolizumab as 
compared with placebo of 0.68, with the use of 
a log-rank test. One interim analysis of overall 
survival was performed when 238 deaths had oc-
curred (the data cutoff date was April 24, 2018), 
with a two-sided alpha level of 0.0193 (stopping 
boundary), computed on the basis of the Lan–

Fleming boundary.22
The primary analysis of progression-free sur-
vival was conducted at the time of the interim 
analysis of overall survival. No interim analysis 
of progression-free survival was planned.
The stratified log-rank test (stratified accord-
ing to sex and ECOG performance-status score 
[0 or 1]) was used for the primary analysis. As 
prespecified in the statistical analysis plan, the 
stratification factor that contained the level with 
the smallest size was dropped from the strati-
fied analysis if at least one stratum had fewer 
than 10 events. As a result, the stratification fac-
tor of presence or absence of brain metastases 
was removed from the stratified analysis because 
it contained the level with the lowest number of 
patients.
Kaplan–Meier methodology was used to esti-
mate the probability of overall survival and pro-
gression-free survival, as well as to calculate the 
median time from randomization to death (for 
overall survival) and the median time from ran-
domization to disease progression or death (for 
progression-free survival) for each group, and the 
Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used to 
construct the 95% confidence interval for the 
medians.23 A similar approach was used for the 
analysis of the duration of response. The hazard 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals for overall 
survival and progression-free survival were esti-
mated with the use of a stratified Cox regression 
model, with the same stratification factors that 
were used in the stratified log-rank test.
Results
Patients
Between June 6, 2016, and May 31, 2017, a total 
of 403 patients were enrolled at 106 sites in 21 
countries and were randomly assigned to the 
atezolizumab group (201 patients) or the placebo 
group (202 patients) (Fig. 1). Baseline character-
istics were well balanced between the groups 
(Table 1, and Tables S2 and S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Twenty-two patients in each 
group received prophylactic cranial irradiation.
In the intention-to-treat population, 104 pa-
tients in the atezolizumab group and 116 in the 
placebo group received at least one subsequent 
therapy (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Fifteen patients in the placebo group re-
ceived subsequent immunotherapy.
Overall Survival Analysis
At the time of data cutoff, the median follow-up 
was 13.9 months. A total of 104 patients (51.7%) 
in the atezolizumab group and 134 patients 
(66.3%) in the placebo group had died. Overall 
survival was significantly longer in the atezolizu­
mab group (median, 12.3 months; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 10.8 to 15.9) than in the 
placebo group (median, 10.3 months; 95% CI, 
9.3 to 11.3). The stratified hazard ratio for death 
was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P = 0.007) (Fig. 2A), 
Figure 1. Eligibility, Randomization, and Analysis.
All patients who underwent randomization were included in the intention-
to-treat analysis regardless of actual treatment received and duration of 
treatment or follow-up. Patients were randomly assigned to receive atezoliz­
umab plus carboplatin and etoposide (atezolizumab group) or placebo plus 
carboplatin and etoposide (placebo group); four 21-day cycles of treatment 
were administered in the induction phase, after which patients received 
­atezolizumab or placebo in a maintenance phase. One patient assigned  
to the placebo group received a dose of atezolizumab and was included in 
the atezolizumab group in the safety analyses. The date of data cutoff was 
April 24, 2018.

and the 1-year overall survival rate was 51.7% in 
the atezolizumab group and 38.2% in the pla-
cebo group.
Progression-free Survival Analysis
A total of 171 patients (85.1%) in the atezolizu­
mab group and 189 patients (93.6%) in the pla-
cebo group had disease progression or died. 
Progression-free survival was longer in the atezo­
lizumab group (median, 5.2 months; 95% CI, 
4.4 to 5.6) than in the placebo group (median, 
4.3 months; 95% CI, 4.2 to 4.5). The stratified 
hazard ratio for disease progression or death 
was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02) (Fig. 2B).
Survival Outcomes in Selected Patient 
Subgroups
The benefit with respect to overall survival and 
progression-free survival associated with the 
addition of atezolizumab was consistent across 
key subgroups. Of the 403 patients in the two 
groups, 374 had plasma available for blood-based

First-Line Atezolizumab in Extensive-Stage SCLC
analysis of tumor mutational burden; 351 of the 
samples (93.8%) yielded high-quality data for 
analysis of tumor mutational burden. An explor-
atory analysis showed a consistent overall sur-
vival and progression-free survival benefit above 
and below the prespecified cutoffs of 10 and 16 
mutations per megabase (Fig. 2C, and Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Confirmed Objective Response Rate  
and Durations of Response
Investigator-assessed confirmed objective response 
rates and median duration of response were 
similar in the two groups (Table 2, and Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix). In total, five 
patients (2.5%) in the atezolizumab group and 
two patients (1.0%) in the placebo group had a 
complete response.
Safety
The population that could be evaluated for safety 
included 198 patients who received at least 1 dose 
of atezolizumab and 196 patients who received 
placebo. The median duration of treatment with 
atezolizumab was 4.7 months (range, 0 to 21), 
and the median number of atezolizumab doses 
received was 7 (range, 1 to 30). The median 
number of doses of chemotherapy was the same 
in the two groups (median, 4 doses of carbopla-
tin and 12 doses of etoposide). The median dose 
intensity and total cumulative dose of chemo-
therapy were similar in the two groups (Table S6 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Adverse events related to any component of the 
trial regimen occurred in 188 patients (94.9%) 
in the atezolizumab group and in 181 patients 
(92.3%) in the placebo group. The most common 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to the trial 
regimen were neutropenia, anemia, and decreased 
neutrophil count (Table 3).
Deaths related to the trial regimen occurred 
in 3 patients (1.5%) in the atezolizumab group 
(death was due to neutropenia in 1 patient, 
pneumonia in 1 patient, and an unspecified 
cause in 1 patient) and in 3 patients (1.5%) in 
the placebo group (death was due to pneumonia 
in 1 patient, septic shock in 1 patient, and car-
diopulmonary failure in 1 patient). Immune-
related adverse events occurred in 79 patients 
(39.9%) in the atezolizumab group and in 48

and hypothyroidism being the most common.

mentary Appendix.
Discussion
At the time of the primary analysis of progres-
sion-free survival and the interim analysis of over-
all survival, this randomized, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 trial showed that the addition of atezoliz­
umab to carboplatin and etoposide resulted in 
significantly longer overall and progression-free 
survival than chemotherapy alone. The median 
overall survival was 2 months longer in the atezo­
lizumab group than in the placebo group, and 
the 1-year overall survival rate was approximate-
ly 13 percentage points higher in the atezolizu­
mab group than in the placebo group (51.7% vs. 
38.2%). Benefits with respect to overall survival 
and progression-free survival were consistent 
across patient subgroups. Objective response 
rates and median duration of response were 
similar in the two groups; however, more patients 
in the atezolizumab group than in the placebo 
group had an ongoing response at the time of 
data cutoff (Table 2, and Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
In patients with treated brain metastases, no 
difference between the two groups was observed 
in overall survival or progression-free survival. 
Owing to the small number of patients with 
brain metastases enrolled in the trial and the 
exploratory nature of the analysis, no conclusions 
can be drawn. Further trials are needed to inves-
tigate the role of immunotherapy in patients with 
small-cell lung cancer who have brain metastases.

First-Line Atezolizumab in Extensive-Stage SCLC
An imbalance in overall survival benefit ap-
peared to be present among patients younger 
than 65 years of age, with older patients faring 
better. There is no simple biologic explanation 
for this observation, and further analyses are 
needed to understand whether other factors may 
have contributed to this result.
Exploratory subgroup analyses showed no 
clear suggestion that blood-based tumor muta-
tional burden levels at either cutoff (10 or 16 
mutations per megabase) were predictive of ben-
efit with atezolizumab in this population. These 
results are in contrast to previous studies that 
suggested an association between high tumor 
mutational burden and better clinical outcomes 
in patients receiving cancer immunotherapies.24,25 
A possible explanation for the lack of greater 
benefit with respect to clinical outcomes in pa-
tients with high blood-based tumor mutational 
burden in this trial is that the combination of 
platinum and etoposide is highly active and also 
highly myelosuppressive.
In this trial, exposure to chemotherapy was 
maintained with the addition of atezolizumab. 
Rates of hematologic side effects were similar 
in the two groups, and the incidence and types of 
immune-related adverse events were similar to 
those seen with atezolizumab monotherapy.26-28
One randomized, phase 3 study assessed an 
immunotherapy (ipilimumab) plus chemotherapy 
as compared with chemotherapy alone in the 
first-line treatment of patients with extensive-
stage small-cell lung cancer, but no significant 
difference in overall survival between the two 
groups was noted.13 Ipilimumab targets CTLA-4 
and stimulates peripheral T-cell activation but 
does not activate T cells in the tumor microen-
vironment; given this mechanism of action, 
Reck and colleagues speculated that ipilimumab 
may be of limited value when added to chemo-
therapy in patients with this disease.13 One pos-
sible explanation for the effectiveness of atezo­
lizumab in addition to chemotherapy in the 
IMpower133 trial may be that carboplatin and 
etoposide might not deplete the intratumoral 
T-cell population, and atezolizumab may be able 
to activate the intratumoral T lymphocytes to 
exert an antitumor effect; however, further stud-
ies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.
In addition, a single-group, phase 2 study 
of  maintenance pembrolizumab in extensive-
stage small-cell lung cancer did not show lon-
ger progression-free survival or overall survival 
when compared with historical data.12 In con-
trast, the current trial showed a significant im-
provement in progression-free survival and over-
all survival with the addition of atezolizumab 
to chemotherapy as first-line treatment. This 
suggests that combining checkpoint inhibition 
with cytotoxic therapy during induction may be 
beneficial and potentially necessary to improve 
overall survival beyond that seen with the cur-
rent standard of care, and thus it may be a pre-
ferred treatment approach over maintenance 
checkpoint-inhibitor therapy alone. Further studies 
directly comparing the two treatment approaches 
are needed.
In summary, this multinational trial in the 
first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell 
lung cancer in a patient population typical for 
this disease showed that the addition of atezoliz­
umab to carboplatin and etoposide was associ-
ated with significantly longer overall survival and 
progression-free survival, with a safety profile 
consistent with the defined toxic effects of the 
individual agents.
