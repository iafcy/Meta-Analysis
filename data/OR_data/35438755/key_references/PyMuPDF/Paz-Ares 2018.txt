BACKGROUND
Standard first-line therapy for metastatic, squamous non–small-cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) is platinum-based chemotherapy or pembrolizumab (for patients with pro-
grammed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression on ≥50% of tumor cells). More recently, 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was shown to significantly prolong overall sur-
vival among patients with nonsquamous NSCLC.
METHODS
In this double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 559 patients 
with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC to receive 200 mg of pembrolizumab 
or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles; all the patients also received carboplatin and 
either paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]–paclitaxel for the first 4 cy-
cles. Primary end points were overall survival and progression-free survival.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 7.8 months, the median overall survival was 15.9 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-combi-
nation group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 14.8) in the placebo-combination 
group (hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001). The overall sur-
vival benefit was consistent regardless of the level of PD-L1 expression. The median 
progression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-
combination group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the placebo-combination 
group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.70; 
P<0.001). Adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% of the patients in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group and in 68.2% of the patients in the placebo-
combination group. Discontinuation of treatment because of adverse events was more 
frequent in the pembrolizumab-combination group than in the placebo-combination 
group (13.3% vs. 6.4%).
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC, the addition of 
pembrolizumab to chemotherapy with carboplatin plus paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel 
resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than che-
motherapy alone. (Funded by Merck Sharp & Dohme; KEYNOTE-407 ClinicalTrials.gov

S
quamous non–small-cell lung can-
cer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 
20 to 30% of all lung cancers and is associ-
ated with shorter survival than is nonsquamous 
NSCLC.1-4 Historically, the lack of targetable aber-
rations meant that treatment for squamous NSCLC 
was mostly limited to cytotoxic chemotherapy. The 
combination of the epidermal growth factor re-
ceptor inhibitor necitumumab and chemotherapy 
with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the first-line 
treatment of squamous NSCLC significantly pro-
longed overall survival, as compared with chemo-
therapy alone, but the magnitude of benefit was 
small.5 Inhibitors of programmed death recep-
tor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are effective in 
the treatment of squamous and nonsquamous 
NSCLC.6-11 To determine whether the addition of 
the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda, 
Merck) to platinum-based chemotherapy improves 
outcomes in patients with squamous NSCLC of 
any level of PD-L1 expression, we conducted the 
global, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
KEYNOTE-407 trial, which compared pembroli-
zumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and either 
paclitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound [nab]–
paclitaxel [Abraxane, Celgene]) with placebo plus 
chemotherapy (carboplatin and either paclitaxel 
or nab-paclitaxel).
Methods
Patients
Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were 
18 years of age or older, had pathologically con-
firmed stage IV squamous NSCLC (as classified 
according to the seventh edition of the Cancer Stag-
ing Manual of the American Joint Commission on 
Cancer12), had received no previous systemic 
therapy for metastatic disease, had an Eastern Co-
operative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance-
status score of 0 or 1 (on a 5-point scale, with 
higher scores indicating increasing disability; a 
score of 0 indicates no symptoms, and 1 mild 
symptoms),13 had at least one measurable lesion 
according to version 1.1 of the Response Evalua-
tion Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),14 and 
provided a tumor sample for the determination 
of PD-L1 status. Patients were excluded if they 
had symptomatic central nervous system metas-
tases, had a history of noninfectious pneumoni-
tis that required the use of glucocorticoids, had 
active autoimmune disease, or were receiving 
systemic immunosuppressive treatment. Full eli-
gibility criteria are listed in the trial protocol, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.
Trial Design and Treatments
In this double-blind trial, randomization was 
performed with the use of an interactive voice-
response and integrated Web-response system. 
Randomization was stratified according to PD-L1 
tumor proportion score (≥1% vs. <1%; tumor pro-
portion score is the percentage of tumor cells with 
membranous PD-L1 staining, with <1% indicating 
PD-L1–negative), choice of taxane (paclitaxel vs. 
nab-paclitaxel), and geographic region of enroll-
ment (East Asia vs. the rest of the world). Patients 
were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive 
200 mg of pembrolizumab or saline placebo on 
day 1 for up to 35 cycles. For the first 4 cycles, 
all the patients also received carboplatin (at a dose 
calculated to produce an area under the concen-
tration–time curve of 6 mg per milliliter per min-
ute) on day 1 and either paclitaxel (200 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area) on day 1 or 
nab-paclitaxel (100 mg per square meter) on days 
1, 8, and 15. All treatments were administered 
intravenously in 3-week cycles. The patients who 
received paclitaxel also received premedication 
with a glucocorticoid, a type 1 antihistamine, and 
a type 2 antihistamine according to local guide-
lines; premedication with a glucocorticoid and 
antihistamines was not required for patients who 
received nab-paclitaxel.
The assigned treatment was continued until 
radiographic disease progression, the occurrence 
of unacceptable toxic effects, an investigator’s deci-
sion to discontinue the treatment, or withdrawal 
of patient consent. If toxic effects were clearly at-
tributed to one component of the treatment, that 
component alone could be discontinued. Patients 
who had radiographic disease progression but 
were clinically stable could continue to receive 
treatment at the discretion of an investigator until 
disease progression was confirmed by imaging 
performed at least 28 days after the imaging as-
sessment that first showed disease progression. 
The trial-group assignment could be unblinded for 
a patient who had disease progression confirmed 
by blinded, independent review of radiologic im-
ages at a central laboratory; such patients in the 
placebo-combination group were eligible to cross 
over to receive pembrolizumab monotherapy if all 
protocol-specified criteria were met. Patients in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group who were 
deemed to have clinical benefit from treatment

despite radiographically confirmed disease pro-
gression were permitted to continue open-label 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Additional details 
regarding treatment decisions, management of 
adverse events, and eligibility criteria for cross-
over are available in the protocol.
Assessments
The PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent 
Technologies) was used to assess PD-L1 expression 
in formalin-fixed tumor samples obtained at the 
time metastatic disease was diagnosed. PD-L1 
expression was assessed during screening at a 
central laboratory and was characterized accord-
ing to the tumor proportion score.15 Investigators 
and patients were unaware of the tumor pro-
portion score. Adverse events and abnormal labo-
ratory findings were graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Tumor 
imaging was scheduled for weeks 6, 12, and 18 
and then every 9 weeks through week 45 and ev-
ery 12 weeks thereafter. Response was assessed 
according to RECIST, version 1.1.14 Patients were 
contacted to assess survival every 12 weeks dur-
ing follow-up.
Trial Oversight
The trial was designed by a panel of academic advi-
sors and employees of Merck Sharp & Dohme, the 
sponsor of the trial. An external, independent 
monitoring committee oversaw the trial and as-
sessed efficacy and safety at prespecified interim 
analyses. The trial protocol and all amendments 
were approved by the appropriate ethics committee 
at each participating center. All patients provided 
written informed consent before enrollment.
The authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and for the fidelity of the 
trial to the protocol. The trial was conducted in 
accordance with the provisions of the International 
Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Prac-
tice guidelines. All the authors had access to the 
data. Assistance in the preparation of the manu-
script was provided by a medical writer employed 
by the sponsor, and all the authors participated in 
writing or reviewing and editing the manuscript.
Statistical Analysis
The trial had dual primary end points of overall 
survival and progression-free survival, which was 
assessed by means of blinded, independent central 
review of radiologic images. The secondary end 
points were response rate and duration of re-
sponse, which were assessed by means of blinded, 
independent central radiologic review, and safety. 
The effects of PD-L1 expression on overall survival, 
progression-free survival, and response rate were 
prespecified exploratory end points. Efficacy was 
assessed in the intention-to-treat population, 
which included all patients who underwent ran-
domization. Safety was assessed in the as-treat-
ed population, which included all patients who 
underwent randomization and received at least 
one dose of the assigned combination treatment.
The Kaplan–Meier method was used to esti-
mate overall survival, progression-free survival, 
and duration of response. The stratified log-rank 
test was used to assess between-group differences 
in overall and progression-free survival. A strati-
fied Cox proportional-hazards model and Efron’s 
method of tie handling were used to assess the 
magnitude of the difference between the trial 
groups. There was no violation of the proportional-
hazards model in the intention-to-treat population. 
In some subgroups, there was a delayed separa-
tion of the survival curves, suggesting a possible 
deviation from the proportional-hazards assump-
tion. The stratified method of Miettinen and Nur-
minen was used to assess differences in response 
rate. The randomization stratification factors were 
applied to all stratified analyses.
The full statistical analysis plan is available 
with the protocol. The graphical method of Mau-
rer and Bretz was used to control the family-wise 
type I error rate at a one-sided alpha level of 
0.025 across all hypotheses and interim analyses 
(Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org). We determined that with a sample 
of 560 patients, the trial would have 90% power 
to show a hazard ratio for disease progression or 
death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha level of 0.01 
(as calculated on the basis of 415 events of disease 
progression or death) and 85% power to show a 
hazard ratio for death of 0.70 at a one-sided alpha 
level of 0.01 (as calculated on the basis of 361 
deaths) for the comparison between the pembro-
lizumab-combination group and the placebo-com-
bination group.
The original protocol specified the performance 
of two interim analyses and a final analysis 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). To 
improve the ability of the trial to identify long-
term treatment effects, the protocol was amended 
to specify the performance of three interim analy-
ses and a final analysis (Table S1 in the Supple-

mentary Appendix). The second interim analysis 
was to be performed after enrollment was com-
plete and approximately 332 events of disease 
progression or death had been observed; it was 
estimated that approximately 212 deaths would 
be observed at this time. As of April 3, 2018, there 
were 349 events of disease progression or death 
and 205 deaths, and the multiplicity-adjusted, 
one-sided alpha spent at this interim analysis 
(as determined on the basis of the Lan–DeMets 
O’Brien–Fleming spending function) was 0.008 for 
progression-free survival and 0.0029 for overall 
survival. The external monitoring committee re-
viewed the results of the second interim analysis 
on May 21, 2018. Because the committee reported 
that the efficacy boundaries for the primary hy-
potheses of overall survival and progression-free 
survival had been met, the decision was made to 
report the results of the second interim analysis. 
The trial is continuing in order to evaluate out-
comes with additional follow-up.
Results
Patients and Treatments
A total of 779 patients from 137 sites in 17 coun-
tries were screened for randomization (Fig. S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Of the 561 patients 
who met all eligibility criteria, 2 were excluded 
from randomization because of a physician’s deci-
sion. Between August 19, 2016, and December 28, 
2017, the remaining 559 patients from 125 sites 
underwent randomization; 278 patients were as-
signed to the pembrolizumab-combination group 
and 281 to the placebo-combination group. With 
respect to the stratification factors, a PD-L1 tumor 
proportion score of 1% or greater was observed 
for 63.1% of patients, paclitaxel was the choice of 
taxane for 60.1% of patients, and East Asia was 
the region of enrollment for 19.0% of patients. 
Baseline demographic and disease characteristics 
were as expected for a trial involving patients with 
metastatic, squamous NSCLC and were well bal-
anced between groups (Table 1).
At least one dose of the assigned combination 
treatment was received by all 278 patients in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group and by 280 of 
281 patients in the placebo-combination group. 
The median duration of follow-up (defined as the 
time from randomization to death or the date of 
data cutoff for those who were alive) was 7.8 
months (range, 0.1 to 19.1). The mean (±SD) dura-
tion of treatment was 6.3±4.1 months in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group and 4.7±3.5 
months in the placebo-combination group. Four 
doses of carboplatin were received by 78.8% of 
the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and by 73.2% of the patients in the placebo-
combination group (Table S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Among the patients who received 
paclitaxel, 78.7% in the pembrolizumab-combi-
nation group and 71.3% in the placebo-combina-
tion group received all 4 cycles; among the pa-
tients who received nab-paclitaxel, 22.9% in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group and 21.2% 
in the placebo-combination group received all 
12 doses (66.1% and 64.6%, respectively, received 
5 to 11 doses) (Table S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
As of April 3, 2018, a total of 121 patients 
(43.5%) in the pembrolizumab-combination group 
and 72 patients (25.7%) in the placebo-combina-
tion group were still receiving their assigned 
treatment (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). In the pembrolizumab-combination group, 
12 patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy 
for a median of 3 cycles (range, 1 to 10) after dis-
ease progression was confirmed. In the placebo-
combination group, 75 patients crossed over to 
receive pembrolizumab monotherapy in the trial 
after the occurrence of disease progression, and 
an additional 14 patients received a subsequent 
PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor outside the trial; thus, the 
effective crossover rates (i.e., the rates among the 
patients who crossed over in the trial and those 
who received the same treatment or class of treat-
ment outside the in-trial crossover) were 31.7% 
among the 281 patients in the intention-to-treat 
population and 42.8% among the 208 patients 
who discontinued their assigned treatment for any 
reason.
Efficacy
A total of 205 deaths occurred in the intention-
to-treat population; the median overall survival 
was 15.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 
13.2 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab-com-
bination group and 11.3 months (95% CI, 9.5 to 
14.8) in the placebo-combination group (hazard 
ratio for death, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.85; P<0.001) 
(Fig. 1A). Kaplan–Meier estimates of the rate of 
survival at 1 year were 65.2% in the pembroli-
zumab-combination group and 48.3% in the 
placebo-combination group. The benefit of adding

Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy for Squamous NSCLC
pembrolizumab was observed in all prespecified 
subgroups (Fig. 1B), including in the subgroups 
defined according to PD-L1 tumor proportion 
score (estimated 1-year survival rate among pa-
tients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 
<1% in the pembrolizumab-combination group vs. 
the placebo-combination group, 64.2% vs. 43.3% 
[hazard ratio for death, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.98]; 
among those with a score of 1 to 49%, 65.9% vs. 
50.0% [hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.90]; 
and among those with a score of ≥50%, 63.4% 
vs. 51.0% [hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.10]) 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
A total of 349 events of disease progression 
or death occurred in the intention-to-treat popu-
lation, as assessed by means of blinded, indepen-
dent central radiologic review; the median pro-
gression-free survival was 6.4 months (95% CI, 
6.2 to 8.3) in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7) in the 
placebo-combination group (hazard ratio for dis-
ease progression or death, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45 to 
0.70; P<0.001) (Fig. 2A). The results were similar 
when progression-free survival was assessed by 
means of investigator review (Fig. S4 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix). The progression-free sur-
vival benefit of the pembrolizumab combination 
was observed in all prespecified subgroups 
(Fig. 2B), with incremental improvements noted 
with increasing PD-L1 tumor proportion score 
(median progression-free survival among pa-
tients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 
<1% in the pembrolizumab-combination group 
vs. the placebo-combination group, 6.3 months vs. 
5.3 months [hazard ratio for progression or death, 
0.68; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.98]; among those with a 
score of 1 to 49%, 7.2 months vs. 5.2 months [haz-
ard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.80]; and among 
those with a score of ≥50%, 8.0 months vs. 4.2 
months [hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.58]) 
(Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Appendix).
The response rate, as assessed by means of 
blinded, independent central radiologic review, 
was 57.9% (95% CI, 51.9 to 63.8) in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group and 38.4% (95% CI, 
32.7 to 44.4) in the placebo-combination group. 
The best overall response in each trial group is 
summarized in Table S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. The median time to response was 1.4 
months in each group. The median duration of 
response was 7.7 months (range, 1.1+ to 14.7+

Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy for Squamous NSCLC
total population and in subgroups defined accord-
ing to PD-L1 tumor proportion score is provided 
in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Safety
Adverse events of any grade, regardless of attribu-
tion to a trial regimen by an investigator, occurred 
in 98.2% of the patients in the pembrolizumab-
combination group and in 97.9% of the patients 
in the placebo-combination group (Table 2). Ad-
verse events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 69.8% 
of the patients in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and in 68.2% of the patients in the place-
bo-combination group; led to dose reduction of 
chemotherapy in 22.7% and 17.5%, respectively; 
led to the discontinuation of any treatment com-
ponent in 23.4% and 11.8%; and led to the discon-
tinuation of all treatment components in 13.3% 
and 6.4%. Adverse events led to death in 23 pa-
tients (8.3%) in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and in 18 patients (6.4%) in the placebo-
combination group. Summaries of adverse events 
that occurred in the patients who received pacli-
taxel and in those who received nab-paclitaxel are 
provided in Tables S5 and S6, respectively, in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
The most common adverse events in both trial 
groups were anemia, alopecia, and neutropenia 
(Table 2). Among the adverse events that were 
reported in at least 10% of patients, alopecia and 
pruritus occurred more frequently in the pembro-
lizumab-combination group than in the placebo-
combination group, whereas back pain occurred 
more frequently in the placebo-combination group; 
after adjustment for exposure, rates of alopecia 
and pruritus were similar in the groups (Fig. S7A 
and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Adverse events of grade 3 or higher that occurred 
in at least 10% of patients were anemia and neu-
tropenia (Table 2). Adverse events of grade 3 or 
higher that occurred more frequently in the pem-
brolizumab-combination group than in the pla-
cebo-combination group were pneumonitis and 
autoimmune hepatitis (Fig. S7B in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Immune-mediated adverse 
events and infusion reactions occurred in 28.8% 
of patients in the pembrolizumab-combination 
group and in 8.6% of patients in the placebo-
combination group (Table 3); the events were of 
grade 3 or higher in 10.8% and 3.2%, respec-
tively. One patient in each trial group died from 
an immune-mediated adverse event (pneumonitis 
in both).
Discussion
The results of this phase 3 trial involving patients 
with untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC 
showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to 
standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and 
either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel, as compared 
with chemotherapy alone, prolonged median over-
all survival by 4.6 months (15.9 months vs. 11.3 
months) and median progression-free survival by 
1.6 months (6.4 months vs. 4.8 months). The risk 
of death was 36% lower and the risk of disease 
progression or death was 44% lower in the 
pembrolizumab-combination group than in the 
placebo-combination group. The treatment effect 
was similar among the patients who received pa-
clitaxel and those who received nab-paclitaxel. 
Prolongation of overall survival of a consistent 
magnitude was observed across the categories of 
PD-L1 tumor proportion score (<1%, 1 to 49%, 
and ≥50%), although the upper limit of the 95% 
confidence interval for the subgroup with a score 
of 50% or greater exceeded 1. A higher response 
rate and longer duration of response were also 
observed.
Figure 1 (facing page). Overall Survival in the  
Intention-to-Treat Population.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of overall survival 
in the two trial groups (Panel A) and an analysis of 
overall survival in key prespecified subgroups (Panel B). 
Patients in the pembrolizumab-combination group re-
ceived pembrolizumab plus carboplatin and either pa-
clitaxel or nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)–paclitax-
el. Patients in the placebo-combination group received 
placebo plus carboplatin and either paclitaxel or nab-
paclitaxel. Tick marks in Panel A indicate censoring of 
data at the last time the patient was known to be alive. 
In Panel B, overall survival was analyzed in the overall 
population and in the subgroups defined according to 
the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumor pro-
portion score with the use of a Cox regression model 
that included trial group and the randomization strati-
fication factors (PD-L1 tumor proportion score [≥1% vs. 
<1%], choice of taxane [paclitaxel vs. nab-paclitaxel], 
and geographic region of enrollment [East Asia vs. the 
rest of the world]) as covariates; overall survival was 
analyzed in all the other subgroups with the use of an 
unstratified Cox regression model that included trial 
group as a covariate. Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance-status scores range from 
0 to 5, with 0 indicating no symptoms and higher 
scores indicating increasing disability.13

Figure 2. Progression-free Survival in the Intention-to-Treat Population.
Shown are Kaplan–Meier estimates of progression-free survival in the two trial groups (Panel A) and an analysis of 
progression-free survival in key prespecified subgroups (Panel B). Progression-free survival was assessed according 
to version 1.1 of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors by means of blinded, independent central radio-
logic review. Tick marks in Panel A indicate censoring of data at the last time the patient was known to be alive and 
without disease progression (i.e., at the time of the last imaging assessment). In Panel B, progression-free survival 
was analyzed in the overall population and in the subgroups defined according to the PD-L1 tumor proportion score 
with the use of a Cox regression model that included trial group and the randomization stratification factors as co-
variates; progression-free survival was analyzed in all the other subgroups with the use of an unstratified Cox regres-
sion model that included trial group as a covariate.

In the phase 3 SQUIRE (Squamous NSCLC 
treatment with the Inhibitor of EGF Receptor) 
trial involving patients with untreated metastatic, 
squamous NSCLC, the median overall survival was 
1.6 months longer (11.5 months vs. 9.9 months) 
and the risk of death 16% lower among patients 
who received necitumumab plus gemcitabine and 
cisplatin than among those who received gem-
citabine and cisplatin alone.5 The 11.3-month 
median overall survival observed in the placebo-
combination group in the KEYNOTE-407 trial is 
similar to the 11.5-month median overall sur-
vival observed in the group that received necitu-
mumab plus gemcitabine and cisplatin in the 
SQUIRE trial,5 a finding that further validates 
the benefit of adding pembrolizumab to chemo-
therapy.
The results of the current trial and of three 
other phase 3 trials8,10,11 suggest that pembroli-
zumab has a role in the first-line treatment of 
metastatic NSCLC, regardless of histologic sub-
type or PD-L1 tumor proportion score. In patients 
with PD-L1–negative tumors, pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy has shown a high level of activity as 
compared with chemotherapy alone. In patients 
with PD-L1–positive tumors, the currently avail-
able data do not permit the determination of 
whether pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy has 
greater efficacy than pembrolizumab alone. There-
fore, the treatment decision should be made on 
an individual basis after a discussion of the rela-
tive risks and benefits and consideration of pa-
tient-specific factors.16
The findings with respect to other immune 
checkpoint inhibitors in the first-line treatment 
of metastatic NSCLC have been mixed. In a re-
view of the literature, we found that, to date, 
pembrolizumab has been the only PD-1 or PD-L1 
inhibitor to show a significant survival benefit 
over chemotherapy when given as monotherapy 
or as part of combination therapy for metastatic, 
squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC.8,10,11,17-21 The 
addition of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associ-
ated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab to chemo-
therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel did not 
prolong overall survival, as compared with che-
motherapy alone, among patients with advanced 
squamous NSCLC.18 Recently reported data from 
the phase 3 IMpower131 trial showed that the 
risk of disease progression or death among pa-

Pembrolizumab plus Chemotherapy for Squamous NSCLC
tients with untreated metastatic, squamous 
NSCLC was 29% lower with the addition of the 
PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab to carboplatin and 
nab-paclitaxel than with carboplatin and nab-
paclitaxel alone; no effect on overall survival was 
observed in this interim analysis.19
The PD-L1 tumor proportion score is an es-
tablished biomarker for selecting patients with 
metastatic NSCLC for first-line pembrolizumab 
monotherapy on the basis of the clear relation-
ship between higher PD-L1 expression in tumors 
and increasing benefit of pembrolizumab.8,10,22 
Although there was a relationship between great-
er PD-L1 expression and longer progression-free 
survival in the KEYNOTE-407 trial and a relation-
ship between greater PD-L1 expression and lon-
ger overall and progression-free survival in a 
phase 3 trial of pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed 
and a platinum-based drug for nonsquamous 
NSCLC,11 the clinical usefulness of PD-L1 as a bio-
marker in patients receiving combination therapy 
may be less clear, given that the combination treat-
ments improved outcomes over chemotherapy 
across all categories of PD-L1 tumor proportion 
scores. Other potential biomarkers for immune 
checkpoint inhibition have been evaluated, includ-
ing tumor mutational burden, which appears to be 
complementary to and nonoverlapping with PD-L1 
expression.17,20,21 In the phase 3 CheckMate 227 
trial, the risk of disease progression or death 
among patients with previously untreated squa-
mous or nonsquamous NSCLC with a high tumor 
mutational burden was 42% lower with nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy.20 An 
exploratory analysis of data from patients with 
PD-L1–negative tumors suggested that high tumor 
mutational burden may predict a progression-
free survival benefit for nivolumab plus chemo-
therapy over chemotherapy alone.21 Currently, the 
ability of tumor mutational burden to predict an 
overall survival benefit is uncertain.17,20,21
The adverse-event profile observed in the cur-
rent trial was as expected on the basis of the 
known events associated with pembrolizumab, 
carboplatin, paclitaxel, and nab-paclitaxel, with 
no new safety signals identified. Although the 
rates of treatment discontinuation due to ad-
verse events were generally low, more patients in 
the pembrolizumab-combination group than in 
the placebo-combination group discontinued the 
regimen because of adverse events, probably in 
part because of the longer duration of treatment 
in this group.
A limitation of this trial is the short duration 
of follow-up, which is a consequence of the sec-
ond interim analysis being event-driven and not 
time-driven. Given the stringency of the protocol-
specified criteria for declaring statistical signifi-
cance at the time of the second interim analysis, 
the durability of the benefit of pembrolizumab, 
and results observed with long-term follow-up in 
other studies of pembrolizumab-based therapy 
in patients with metastatic NSCLC,8,23-25 we ex-
pect that the benefit observed in the pembroli-
zumab-combination group will be maintained or 
even increase with longer follow-up. The short 
follow-up also precludes the identification of long-
term toxic effects, although, on the basis of stud-
ies of pembrolizumab monotherapy, long-term 
toxic effects are not expected. This trial is being 
continued to evaluate long-term efficacy and safe-
ty. Another limitation is the low percentage of 
patients in the placebo-combination group who 
received a subsequent checkpoint inhibitor after 
treatment components were discontinued. Spe-
cific reasons for not receiving a subsequent check-
point inhibitor were not collected and are not 
clear. Possible reasons include death soon after 
discontinuation or the decision to enter palliative 
care. It is likely that the percentage of patients 
who receive subsequent checkpoint inhibition will 
increase with additional follow-up.
In conclusion, the addition of pembrolizumab 
to standard chemotherapy with carboplatin and 
either paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel in patients with 
previously untreated metastatic, squamous NSCLC 
resulted in significantly longer overall survival and 
progression-free survival, a higher response rate, 
and a longer duration of response than chemo-
therapy alone, regardless of the level of PD-L1 ex-
pression.
