Summary 
Background First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy improves overall and progression-free survival in patients with 
untreated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with a programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) tumour proportion score 
(TPS) of 50% or greater. We investigated overall survival after treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy in 
patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. 
Methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done in 213 medical centres in 32 countries. Eligible patients 
were adults (≥18 years) with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without a 
sensitising EGFR mutation or ALK translocation and with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
performance status score of 0 or 1, life expectancy 3 months or longer, and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. Randomisation 
was computer generated, accessed via an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response system, and 
stratified by region of enrolment (east Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score (0 vs 1), histology 
(squamous vs non-squamous), and PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1–49%). Enrolled patients were randomly assigned 1:1 in 
blocks of four per stratum to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles or the investigator’s 
choice of platinum-based chemotherapy for four to six cycles. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with 
a TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater (one-sided significance thresholds, p=0·0122, p=0·0120, 
and p=0·0124, respectively) in the intention-to-treat population, assessed sequentially if the previous findings were 
significant. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02220894. 
Findings From Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1274 patients (902 men, 372 women, median age 63 years [IQR 57–69]) 
with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater were allocated to pembrolizumab (n=637) or chemotherapy (n=637) and included 
in the intention-to-treat population. 599 (47%) had a TPS of 50% or greater and 818 patients (64%) had a TPS of 
20% or greater. As of Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12·8 months. Overall survival was significantly longer in the 
pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group in all three TPS populations (≥50% hazard ratio 0·69, 95% CI 
0·56–0·85, p=0·0003; ≥20% 0·77, 0·64–0·92, p=0·0020, and ≥1% 0·81, 0·71–0·93, p=0·0018). The median surival 
values by TPS population were 20·0 months (95% CI 15·4–24·9) for pembrolizumab versus 12·2 months (10·4–14·2) 
for chemotherapy, 17·7 months (15·3–22·1) versus 13·0 months (11·6–15·3), and 16·7 months (13·9–19·7) versus 
12·1 months (11·3–13·3), respectively. Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 113 (18%) of 
636 treated patients in the pembrolizumab group and in 252 (41%) of 615 in the chemotherapy group and led to death 
in 13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients, respectively. 
Interpretation The benefit-to-risk profile suggests that pembrolizumab monotherapy can be extended as first-line 
therapy to patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR or ALK 
alterations and with low PD-L1 TPS. 


Introduction 
The ultimate objective of treating advanced non-small-cell 
lung cancer is to improve overall survival and quality of 
life. Before the availability of molecularly targeted therapy, 
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was treated with 
chemotherapy, which is associated with a median survival 
of approximately 12 months1 and has a poor adverse event 
profile. Targeted therapies have become standard first-line 
therapy for patients with driver oncogenes. Median 
survival in phase 3 trials ranged from 18·6 months to 
30·5 months for tyrosine-kinase inhibitors targeting 
EGFR mutations2–4 and extends beyond 4 years for those

pembrolizumab group compared with in the standard

and 30·0 months vs 14·2 months, respectively). 
Pembrolizumab is a humanised IgG4 monoclonal anti- 
body against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). The 
phase 1 KEYNOTE-0018 and phase 2/3 KEYNOTE-0109 
studies established the correlation between increased 
expression of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and benefit from 
treatment with pembrolizumab in patients with ad- 
vanced non-small-cell 
lung cancer. KEYNOTE-02410,11 
was a phase 3 study that compared pembrolizumab 
monotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy as first- 
line treatment in 305 patients with metastatic non-small- 
cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 tumour proportion score 
(TPS) of 50% or greater. The primary endpoint of

In the international, randomised, open-label, phase 3 
KEYNOTE-042 study, we compared pembrolizumab 
monotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy as 
first-line therapy for patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 TPS of 
1% or greater. Here we report data from the second 
interim analysis.

Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed on June 15, 2018, with the term “PD-1 OR 
PD-L1 OR MK-3475 OR pembrolizumab OR Keytruda OR 
BMS-936558 OR nivolumab OR Opdivo OR MPDL3280A OR 
atezolizumab OR Tecentriq OR MEDI4736 OR durvalumab OR 
Imfinzi OR MSB0010718C OR avelumab OR Bavencio AND 
metastatic AND first line OR previously untreated AND non-small 
cell lung cancer OR NSCLC.” We also used this term to search the 
abstracts from the 2017 and 2018 American Society of Clinical 
Oncology annual meetings and the 2016 and 2017 European 
Society for Medical Oncology congresses to identify results of 
clinical trials not yet published in full. We applied no other search 
parameters. We identified several randomised, phase 3 studies of 
patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer treated with 
antibodies against programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) or its 
ligand PD-L1. The KEYNOTE-024 study showed significantly 
longer progression-free and overall survival with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy than with platinum-doublet chemotherapy in 
patients with a PD-L1 tumour proportion score (TPS) of 50% or 
greater. The CheckMate 026 study did not show improved overall 
survival with nivolumab monotherapy versus platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy in the primary population of patients with a 
PD-L1 expression level of 5% or greater. The KEYNOTE-189 study 
showed that first-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall 
survival and progression-free survival compared with 
chemotherapy alone, irrespective of PD-L1 TPS, in patients with 
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The KEYNOTE-407 
study demonstrated similar findings in patients with squamous 
non-small-cell lung cancer. The IMpower131 study of 
atezolizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy showed 
significantly prolonged progression-free survival versus 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy alone in patients with 
squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 
expression. The IMpower150 study showed that the combination 
of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and platinum-doublet 
chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free and 
overall survival in patients with non-squamous non-small-cell 
lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 expression or EGFR or ALK 
genetic alteration status. The CheckMate 227 study showed that 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab significantly prolonged 
progression-free survival versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy 
in patients with a high tumour mutational burden, irrespective 
of PD-L1 expression. 
Added value of this study 
The randomised phase 3 KEYNOTE-042 trial of pembrolizumab 
monotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment 
enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater, 
expanding the population of patients compared with that 
assessed in the KEYNOTE-024 study. Overall survival was 
assessed as the primary endpoint, and we found a significant 
survival benefit in patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. 
The effect was greatest in patients with a TPS of 50% or greater, 
but remained significant in patients with a TPS of 1% or greater. 
Despite longer exposure to pembrolizumab treatment than to 
chemotherapy, the frequency of treatment-related adverse 
events, including those of grade 3 or worse, was lower in the 
pembrolizumab group. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
With our findings of a survival benefit and manageable safety 
profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy as first-line treatment 
in patients with PD-L1-positive, locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small-cell lung cancer, we suggest that use of this drug can 
be extended to previously untreated patients with a TPS as low 
as 1%. In the absence of direct prospective comparisons of 
pembrolizumab given alone and in combination with 
chemotherapy, patients with PD-L1-positive non-small-cell 
lung cancer should discuss the benefits and risks of each 
regimen with their physicians when choosing first-line therapy. 
Colombia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Guatemala, Hungary, 
Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, 
Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, South 
Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, 
Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Patients were 
eligible for enrolment if they were aged 18 years or older, 
had locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung 
cancer without a sensi tising EGFR mutation or ALK 
translocation, had at least one measurable lesion according 
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
version 1.1, had received no previous therapy for locally 
advanced or metastatic disease, had an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor mance status score of 0 
or 1, had life expectancy of 3 months or longer, and had a 
PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater. We excluded patients if they 
had known unstable or untreated central nervous system 
metastases, had a history of non-infectious pneumonitis 
that required systemic gluco corticoids, had active auto- 
immune disease, were receiving systemic immuno- 
suppressive treatment, or had a known active hepatitis B 
or C virus infection. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are included in the trial protocol (appendix). 
The protocol and all amendments were approved by the 
appropriate ethics committee at each centre. The trial was 
done in accordance with the protocol, its amendments, 
and the standards of Good Clinical Practice. All patients 
provided written informed consent before enrolment. 
Randomisation and masking 
The randomisation schedule was generated by a com- 
puterised randomised list generator and held centrally. 
Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab 
200 mg alone or the investigator’s choice of carboplatin to 
achieve an area under the curve of 5–6 mg/mL per min 
plus paclitaxel 200 mg/m² or pemetrexed 500 mg/m². 
Treatment assignments were obtained via an interactive 
voice-response and 
integrated web-response system 
(Almac Clinical Technologies, Souderton, PA, USA). All 
drugs were administered intravenously every 3 weeks. 
Randomisation was stratified by region of enrolment (east 
Asia vs rest of world), ECOG performance status score 
(0 vs 1), histology (squamous vs non-squamous), and 
PD-L1 TPS (≥50% vs 1–49%), and treatment was allocated 
in blocks of four in each stratum. 
Treatment was open label because the differences 
in infusion durations, administration schedules, and 
require ments for premedication would have made 
masking difficult. Thus, patients, investigators, members 
of the external data monitoring committee, and select 
representatives of the sponsor were not masked, but the 
central radiological reviewers were unaware of treatment 
assignment. 
Procedures 
Treatment was continued until radiographic progression, 
the patient developed intolerable toxic effects, the inves- 
tigator decided to stop treatment, or the patient withdrew 
consent, up to a maximum of 35 cycles in the 
pembrolizumab group and for four to six cycles in the 
chemotherapy group. Maintenance therapy with peme- 
trexed 500 mg/m² every 3 weeks was optional but was 
encouraged in patients with non-squamous histology 
who were allocated to the chemotherapy group. Patients 
with radiographic disease progression who were clinically 
stable could continue study treatment until progression 
was con firmed on a scan obtained at least 4 weeks 
later. No crossover from the chemotherapy group to 
pembrolizumab was allowed as part of the study. 
PD-L1 expression was assessed during screening at 
two central laboratories (one for China and one for the 
rest of the world) with the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx 
assay (Agilent Technologies, Carpinteria, CA, USA) and 
measured in formalin-fixed tumour samples obtained 
by core-needle or excisional biopsy of a tumour lesion 
or from tissue resected at or after the time metastatic 
disease was diagnosed. Expression was categorised by 
TPS, which was defined as the percentage of tumour 
cells with membranous PD-L1 staining.12 TPS results 
were not revealed to the sponsor, investigator, or site 
staff. Radiographic tumour imaging was done at 
baseline and scheduled for every 9 weeks for the first 
45 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter. Response was 
assessed according to RECIST version 1.1 by masked 
and independent central review. 
Adverse events were reported during study treatment 
and for 30 days after treatment ended. Serious adverse 
events and events of special interest in relation to 
pembrolizumab treatment were reported for 90 days after 
treatment ended. Adverse events were graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. During follow-up, 
patients were contacted every 2 months to assess survival. 
Outcomes 
In the original protocol, written in 2014, the primary 
endpoint was overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 
TPS of 50% or greater and secondary endpoints were 
overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or 
greater and progression-free survival in patients with a 
TPS of 50% or greater and of 1% or greater. Exploratory 
endpoints were overall and progression-free survival in 
patients with a TPS of 1–49% and objective response 
among those with a TPS of 50% or greater, 1–49%, and 
1% or greater. In 2015, after the enrolment of 662 patients, 
a significant overall survival benefit was reported in 
patients with previously treated advanced non-small- 
cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 TPS of 1% or greater in 
the KEYNOTE-010 study of pembrolizumab versus 
docetaxel.9 Consequently, the primary end points in our 
study protocol were amended to overall survival in 
patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater and of 1% or 
greater, and the secondary and exploratory endpoints 
were amended to include progression-free survival and 
objective response, respec tively, in these populations. In 



April 2017, after enrolment was complete, we introduced 
an intermediate TPS cutoff point. This decision was 
based on an analysis of data from KEYNOTE-0109 and 
the results of the CheckMate 026 study13 of nivolumab 
versus chemotherapy in patients with previously un- 
treated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and a PD-L1 
expression level of 1% or greater. We changed the primary 
endpoints to overall survival in patients with a PD-L1 TPS 
of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater and 
secondary endpoints to progression-free survival and 
objective response in these populations. All endpoint 
changes were complete before data lock. Safety, a 
secondary endpoint since the original protocol, was 
assessed by clinical review of adverse events, laboratory 
tests, and vital signs in the overall study population 
(ie, PD-L1 TPS ≥1%). Duration of response was a 
protocol-specified exploratory endpoint. 
Overall survival was defined as the time from random- 
isation to death from any cause. Progression-free survival 
was defined as the time from randomisation to radio- 
logically confirmed disease progression or death from any 
cause. Objective response was defined as the proportion of 
patients with radiologically confirmed complete or partial 
response. Duration of response was defined as the time 
from first documented complete or partial response to 
radiologically confirmed disease progression or death 
from any cause. Response and disease progression were 
assessed by masked inde pendent central review according 
to RECIST version 1.1. 


Statistical analysis 
Overall survival, progression-free survival, and objective 
intention-to-treat 
response were assessed 
population, defined as all patients alive at the time of 
random allocation to a treatment group. Duration of 
response was assessed in all patients who had complete 
or partial response. Safety was assessed in the as-treated 
population, defined as all randomly allocated patients 
who received at least one dose of study treatment. 
SAS version 9.4 was used for all statistical analyses. 
The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall 
survival, progression-free survival, and duration of 
response. Data for patients who were alive or lost to 
follow-up were censored at the time of last contact for 
estimation of overall survival. Data for patients without 
disease progression or who were lost to follow-up were 
censored at the time of last tumour imaging for esti- 
mation of progression-free survival. Data for patients 
who were alive without evidence of disease progression 
but who discontinued the study without radiographical 
evidence of progression were censored at the time of the 
last radiographical assessment showing response. For 
progression-free survival and duration of response, data 
for patients who started new anticancer therapy without 
radiographic evidence of progression were censored at 
the time of the last tumour assessment before new 
anticancer therapy was initiated. 



to assess 
between-group differences in overall and progression-free 
survival. A stratified Cox regression model with Efron’s 
method of tie handling14 was used to estimate hazard ratios 
(HRs) and associated 95% CIs. The stratified Miettinen 
and Nurminen method15 was used to assess between-group 
differences in response rate. All randomisation strati- 
fication factors were applied to all stratified analyses. 
The evolution of the statistical analysis plan and study 
endpoints related to protocol amendments is summarised 
in the appendix. The final protocol specified two interim 
analyses and a final analysis. The hypotheses of overall 
survival and progression-free survival were assessed 
sequentially by TPS, in the order of 50% or greater, 
20% or greater, and 1% or greater. Hypotheses were 
tested only if superiority was established for the 
preceding hypothesis. The family-wise type I error was 
strictly controlled at a one-sided α of 0·025. Accounting 
for the 0·01576 α spent at the first interim analysis, the 
superiority boundaries were adjusted for multiplicity 
with the Hwang-Shih-DeCani α spending function,16 
with the γ parameter set at –0·9023 and an information 
fraction of 1166 of 1353 (ie, the numbers of study days to 
the second interim analysis and the planned final 
analysis, respectively, from the date the first patient was 
randomised). Assuming overall survival follows an 
exponential distribution with a median of 13 months,17 an 
HR for overall survival of 0·65 between the pembro- 
lizumab and chemotherapy groups among patients with 
a TPS of 50% or greater, an en rolment period of 
approximately 26 months, a minimum follow-up period 
of 19 months after completion of enrolment, and a 
dropout rate of 0·003 per month for overall survival, 
we calculated that a sample size of approximately 
1240 patients would provide the power at the following 
levels with a one-sided α of 0·025: 99% to detect an HR 
of 0·65 among patients with a TPS of 50% or greater 
with 398 deaths in the population; 98% to detect 
piecewise HRs of 0·80 from 0 to 6 months of treatment 
and 0·64 after 6 months of treatment among patients 
with a TPS score of 20% or greater with 557 deaths; and 
91% to detect piecewise HRs of 0·92 for 0 to 6 months of 
treatment and 0·73 after 6 months of treatment among 
patients with a TPS of 1% or greater with 900 deaths. 
We used piecewise HRs to account for the possibility of 
non-proportional hazards in the treat ment effect of 
pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy. 
The first interim analysis was planned for around 
6 months after the final patient was enrolled and was 
done using a data cutoff of Aug 30, 2017. After reviewing 
results, the external data monitoring committee recom- 
mended that the study continue as planned. The second 
interim analysis was based on a cutoff date of Feb 26, 2018, 
and was done 38·3 months after enrolment of the first 
patient. The multiplicity-adjusted significance thresholds 
are sum marised in the appendix. The external monitoring 
committee reviewed the results on April 6, 2018, and

reported that pembrolizumab was superior to chemo- 
therapy for overall survival in all PD-L1 TPS populations 
tested. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT02220894. 
Role of the funding source 
The funder of the study participated in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing 
of the report. The corresponding author had access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication. 
Results 
3428 patients across all study sites were screened for 
enrolment (figure 1, appendix). 3019 had samples that 

were evaluable 
for PD-L1 expression, of whom 
1978 (66%) had a TPS of 1% or greater, including 
922 (31%) who had a TPS of 50% or greater. From 
Dec 19, 2014, to March 6, 2017, 1275 patients were 
randomly allocated to receive pembrolizumab (n=638) 
in 
or chemotherapy 
the 
pembrolizumab group was 
assigned 
treatment after death and, therefore, the intention-to- 
treat popluation included 1274 patients (637 in each 
group, figure 1). Important protocol deviations, defined 
as those that could sub stantially affect the quality or 
integrity of key study data or a patient’s rights, safety, or 
wellbeing, were reported in 17 (1%) of 1274 patients 
(appendix), but only one patient discontinued study 
treatment because of a study violation (figure 1). The

patient demographics and disease char acteristics were 
similar between groups and across the TPS populations 
at baseline (table 1). 
At least one dose of study therapy was received by 
636 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 615 in 
the chemotherapy group (figure 1). The chemotherapy 
regimens administered are summarised in the appendix. 
Among patients with non-squamous histology in the 
chemotherapy group, pemetrexed maintenance therapy 
was received by 196, representing 52% of 375 treated 
patients, 66% of 296 who completed four cycles of 
induction therapy, and 74% of 264 treated patients who 
completed four cycles of induction therapy and for whom 
pemetrexed maintenance was planned at randomisation. 
On Feb 26, 2018, median follow-up was 12·8 months 
(IQR 6·0–20·0). 87 (14%) of 636 patients who started 
pembrolizumab were continuing this treatment, and 
30 (5%) of 615 treated patients in the chemotherapy group 
were receiving pemetrexed maintenance therapy (figure 1). 
At least one subsequent anticancer therapy was received 
by 240 (38%) of 637 patients in the pembrolizumab 
group and 282 (44%) of 637 in the chemotherapy group, 
including 19 (3%) and 126 (20%), respectively, who 
received subsequent immunotherapy (appendix). After 
excluding patients still taking pembrolizumab or who had 
completed or discontinued treatment without later disease 
progression, 240 (51%) of 474 patients in the pembro- 
lizumab group and 282 (56%) of 504 in the chemotherapy 
group received subsequent treatment. 
356 patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater 
died. Overall survival differed significantly between 
groups (figure 2). The median survival duration was 
20·0 months (95% CI 15·4–24·9) in the pembrolizumab 
group compared with 12·2 months (10·4–14·2) in the

chemotherapy group. 496 patients in the TPS 20% or 
greater population died, with the difference in overall 
survival remaining significant (figure 2). Median sur- 
vival was 17·7 months (95% CI 15·3–22·1) in the 
pembrolizumab group compared with 13·0 months 
(11·6–15·3) in the chemotherapy group. In the TPS 1% 
or greater population, 809 patients died and overall 
survival was again significantly different (figure 2). 
Median survival was 16·7 months (95% CI 13·9–19·7) in 
the pembrolizumab group compared with 12·1 months 
(11·3–13·3) in the chemotherapy group. The estimated 
percentages of patients alive at 24 months in the 
pembrolizumab and the chemotherapy groups were 
45% and 30%, respectively, in the TPS 50% or greater 
the TPS 20% or 
population, 41% and 30% 
greater population, and 39% and 28% in the TPS 1% 
or greater population. A survival benefit with pembro- 
lizumab was evident in most subgroups assessed 
(appendix). For never smokers the HRs were 1·00 or 
greater, but the 95% CIs overlapped with those of the 

overall population. In a prespecified, exploratory sub- 
group analysis, overall survival in the TPS 1–49% popu- 
lation seemed to be similar in the two groups (figure 2). 
The median survival values were 13·4 months (95% CI 
and 
10·7–18·2) 
12·1 months (11·0–14·0) in the chemotherapy group. 


1013 patients died or had disease progression in the 
PD-L1 TPS 1% or greater population, including 631 in the 
TPS 20% or greater population and 454 in the TPS 50% 
or greater population. Median progression-free survival 
was 7·1 months (95% CI 5·9–9·0) in the pembrolizumab 
group and 6·4 months (6·1–6·9) in the chemotherapy 
group in the TPS 50% or greater population, 6·2 months 
(5·1–7·8) and 6·6 months (6·2–7·3) in the 20% or 
greater population, and 5·4 months (4·3–6·2) and 
6·5 months (6·3–7·0) in the TPS 1% or greater 
population (figure 3). Significance in the TPS 50% 
or greater population did not reach the prespecified 
superiority boundary and, therefore, was not tested in 
the TPS 20% or greater and 1% or greater populations.

Pembrolizumab group 
Chemotherapy group 
In the PD-L1 TPS 50% or greater population, 118 (39%, 
95% CI 34–45) of 299 patients in the pembrolizumab 
group and 96 (32%, 27–38) of 300 patients in the 
chemotherapy group had an objective response to 
treatment. The values in the TPS 20% or greater and 1% or 
greater populations were 138 (33%, 29–38) of 413 versus 
117 (29%, 25–34) of 405 and 174 (27%, 24–31) of 637 versus 
169 (27%, 23–30) of 637, respectively (appendix). The 
median duration of re sponse was 20·2 months in the 
pembrolizumab group in all TPS populations and was 
10·8 months, 8·3 months, and 8·3 months, respectively, 
in the TPS 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or 
greater populations in the chemotherapy group (appendix). 
In the as-treated population, the median number of 
doses administered was nine (range one to 36) in the 
pembrolizumab group and six (one to 42) in the chemo- 
therapy group. Treatment-related adverse events of any 
grade occurred in 399 (63%) of 636 patients in the 
pembrolizumab group and 553 (90%) of 615 patients 
in the chemotherapy group (table 2). Treatment-related 
adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity occurred in 
113 (18%) of 636 patients in the pembrolizumab group 
and 252 (41%) of 615 patients in the chemotherapy 
group. Treatment-related adverse events led to death in 
13 (2%) and 14 (2%) patients in the pembrolizumab 
and chemotherapy groups, respectively, and treatment 
discontinuation in 57 (9%) and 58 (9%), respectively. The 
most common treatment-related adverse event was 
hypothyroidism (69 [11%] of 636) in the pembrolizumab 
group and anaemia (229 [37%] of 615) in the chemo- 
therapy group (table 2, appendix). Treatment-related 
adverse events of grade 3 or worse severity that 
occurred in 20 or more patients were pneumonitis in 
the pembrolizumab group and anaemia, decreased 
neutrophil count, neutropenia, decreased white blood cell 
count, and decreased platelet count in the chemotherapy 
group (table 2, appendix). 
Adverse events of interest (events judged likely to be 
immune mediated and infusion reactions) occurred in 
177 (28%) of 636 patients (51 [8%] grade ≥3) in the 
pembrolizumab group and 44 (7%) of 615 patients 
(9 [1%] grade ≥3) in the chemotherapy group (table 3). 
The only grade 3 or worse immune-mediated events that 
occurred in five or more patients in the pembrolizumab 
group were pneumonitis, severe skin reactions, and 
hepatitis (table 3). One patient in the pembrolizumab 
group died because of pneumonitis that occurred 
concurrently with disease progression. 
Discussion 
In this randomised phase 3 study of patients with 
previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic 
non-small-cell lung cancer without sensitising EGFR 
mut ations or ALK translocations, pembrolizumab mono- 
therapy significantly prolonged overall survival compared 
with standard chemotherapy in patients with a PD-L1 
TPS of 50% or greater, 20% or greater, and 1% or greater.

Pembrolizumab also had a better safety profile than 
chemotherapy. 
Consistent with previous studies of pembrolizumab 
given as monotherapy8,9 or as part of combination 
therapy18 
in patients with metastatic non-small-cell 
lung cancer, there appeared to be a relationship between 
higher tumour PD-L1 expression and greater efficacy of 
pembrolizumab. The HR for overall survival was lowest 
in patients who had a TPS of 50% or greater, which might 
indicate an increased treatment benefit, but the HR 
still favoured pembrolizumab in the TPS 1% or greater 
population. In an exploratory analysis of patients with 
TPS 1–49%, the 95% CI of the HR for overall survival 
crossed 1∙00. Based on the significant survival benefit 
observed in the primary TPS 1% or greater population, 
along with the safety profile compared with chemotherapy, 
pembro lizumab appears to be a reasonable treatment 
option for patients with PD-L1-expressing tumours. 
The median overall survival seen in the pembrolizumab 
group in our PD-L1 TPS 50% or greater population is 
numerically lower than that reported in KEYNOTE-024,11 
although the 95% CIs overlap (20·0 months, 95% CI 
15·4–24·9 in KEYNOTE-042 vs 30·0 months, 18·3 to 
not reached in KEYNOTE-024). Of note, these studies 
enrolled patients in different regions of the world. 
KEYNOTE-024 was done mainly in North America and 
western Europe, with only 13% of patients enrolled in 
east Asia,10 whereas KEYNOTE-042 was done mainly in 
Asia-Pacific, eastern Europe, and South America, and 
enrolled 29% of patients in east Asia. In the KEYNOTE-042 
regions there was less availability of and access to therapy,

particularly immunotherapy, which is reflected in the 
lower percentage of patients in the chemotherapy group 
who received subsequent immunotherapy (20% vs 64% 
in KEYNOTE-024), although crossover to pembrolizumab 
was permitted during KEYNOTE-024. Progression-free 
survival, the primary endpoint of KEYNOTE-024, is less 
likely to be affected by crossover than overall survival, 
which was the primary endpoint of KEYNOTE-042 and, 
thus, why crossover was not permitted KEYNOTE-042. 
Even after the results of KEYNOTE-024 showed a benefit 
in patients with a PD-L1 TPS of 50% or greater, we chose 
not to introduce crossover in KEYNOTE-042. We would 
have had to limit crossover to patients with a TPS of 
50% or greater because benefit had only been shown in 
this population, and crossover would have been allowed 
for only part of the trial. Both these factors would 
have created challenges for study operation and data 
interpretation. Overall, the use of other subsequent 
therapies in this study is more representative of real- 
world clinical practice, where less than half of patients 
receive second-line or later treatment.19,20 
Pembrolizumab did not significantly prolong pro- 
gression-free survival in the PD-L1 TPS 50% or greater 
population at the time of the second interim analysis, and 
per the hierarchical statistical analysis plan, the hypo- 
theses of progression-free survival in the TPS 20% or 
greater and 1% or greater populations were not formally 
tested. Although significant progression-free survival 
benefits do not always accompany significant overall 
survival benefits in studies of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors,9,21–24 the absence of this benefit in the TPS 50% 
or greater population was somewhat unexpected given 
the significant benefit observed in KEYNOTE-024.10 PD-L1 
expression was assessed with the same assay and in 
the same central laboratory in both studies, and the 
distribution of TPS categories across the study popu- 
lations was similar. The greater heterogeneity of the 
KEYNOTE-042 patient population in terms of smoking 
history and availability of susequent therapy might 
help to explain the discrepant progression-free survival 
findings. Based on the recommendation of the external 
monitoring committee, the study is continuing to assess 
progression-free survival after longer follow-up. 
In comparison with pembrolizumab in this study, 
the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab did not significantly 
improve overall survival compared with platinum- 
doublet chemo therapy in the phase 3 CheckMate 026 
study of patients with metastatic or recurrent PD-L1- 
positive non-small-cell lung cancer.24 In the primary 
analysis of CheckMate 026, which included patients with 
a PD-L1 expression level of 5% or greater, as determined 
using the 28-8 antibody, median overall survival was 
14·4 months (95% CI 11·7–17·4) with nivolumab and 
13·2 months (10·7–17·1) with chemo therapy, and the 
HR was 1·02 (95% CI 0·80–1·30). There was also no 
overall survival benefit in the exploratory population of 
patients with a PD-L1 expression level of 50% of greater 
(HR 0·90, 95% CI 0·63–1·29). When comparing results 
of KEYNOTE-042 and CheckMate 026, it should be noted 
that CheckMate 026 permitted crossover after disease 
progression, whereas KEYNOTE-042 did not. Overall, 
60% of patients in the chemotherapy group received 
subsequent nivolumab, which might have decreased the 
treatment effect of nivolumab compared with chemo- 
therapy.13 
Findings from the randomised, double-blind, phase 3 
KEYNOTE-189 and KEYNOTE-407 studies17,25 showed that 
pembrolizumab in combination with standard-of-care 
platinum-doublet chemotherapy signi ficantly prolonged 
overall survival and progression-free survival compared 
with chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy in patients 
with metastatic non-squamous and squamous non-small- 
cell lung cancer, irrespective of PD-L1 TPS. Although 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy might have greater 
efficacy than pembrolizumab alone in patients with 
PD-L1-expressing tumours, particularly in those with lower 
PD-L1 expression levels, a definitive conclusion cannot be 
made without a prospective direct comparison. Ultimately, 
the choice of treatment will need to be determined on an 
individual basis after a discussion between the physician 
and patient on the risks and benefits of each option and 
based on patient-specific factors. 
The safety profiles for pembrolizumab and chemo- 
therapy in this study were generally consistent with those 
in previous reports,8–10 with no new safety signals identified. 
Despite longer treatment exposure in the pembrolizumab 
group than in the chemotherapy group, there were fewer 
treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse. 
Pneumonitis occurred in 8% of patients, but events of 
grade 3 or worse severity accounted for less than half 
of cases (incidence 3%). Importantly, only one patient 
died because of pneumonitis. This patient had multiple 
comorbid conditions, 
including chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease and bilateral broncho alveolar consoli- 
dation, as well as disease progression. 
A limitation of this study is the open-label design, 
which probably explains why 22 patients randomised to 
the chemotherapy group did not receive chemotherapy 
as assigned. These patients might have received immu- 
notherapy as first-line therapy instead, which could have 
decreased the benefit of pembrolizumab compared 
with chemotherapy. Another possible limitation of this 
study is that only 66% of patients with non-squamous 
histology in the chemotherapy group received pemetrexed 
maintenance therapy after completing at least four cycles 
of platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Despite any concerns 
regarding suboptimum therapy in patients with non- 
squamous histology in the chemotherapy group, the 
results were similar to those previously reported for 
chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer.1,26,27 
In conclusion, first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy 
significantly improved overall survival and was associ ated 
than 
with 
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally 





advanced or metastatic non-small-cell 
lung cancer 
without sensitising EGFR mutations or ALK trans- 
location and whose tumours expressed PD-L1 on at 
least 1% of cells. The results of KEYNOTE-042, in which 
overall survival was the primary endpoint, confirm the 
role of pembrolizumab mono therapy as a standard first- 
line treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer with high 
PD-L1 expression and suggest that it is a reasonable 
treatment option for patients with lower PD-L1 expression 
levels. The study is continuing to evaluate outcomes after 
additional follow-up.
