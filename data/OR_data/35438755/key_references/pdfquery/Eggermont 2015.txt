Summary 
Background Ipilimumab is an approved treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. We aimed to assess 
ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with completely resected stage III melanoma at high risk of recurrence. 
Methods We did a double-blind, phase 3 trial in patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma (excluding lymph node 
metastasis ≤1 mm or in-transit metastasis) with adequate resection of lymph nodes (ie, the primary cutaneous melanoma 
must have been completely excised with adequate surgical margins) who had not received previous systemic therapy for 
melanoma from 91 hospitals located in 19 countries. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), centrally by an interactive 
voice response system, to receive intravenous infusions of 10 mg/kg ipilimumab or placebo every 3 weeks for four 
doses, then every 3 months for up to 3 years. Using a minimisation technique, randomisation was stratiﬁ ed by disease 
stage and geographical region. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, assessed by an independent review 
committee, and analysed by intention to treat. Enrollment is complete but the study is ongoing for follow-up for analysis 
of secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00636168. 
Findings Between July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients were randomly assigned to ipilimumab (n=475) or 
placebo (n=476), all of whom were included in the intention-to-treat analyses. At a median follow-up of 2·74 years 
(IQR 2·28–3·22), there were 528 recurrence-free survival events (234 in the ipilimumab group vs 294 in the placebo 
group). Median recurrence-free survival was 26·1 months (95% CI 19·3–39·3) in the ipilimumab group versus 
17·1 months (95% CI 13·4–21·6) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0·75; 95% CI 0·64–0·90; p=0·0013); 3-year 
recurrence-free survival was 46·5% (95% CI 41·5–51·3) in the ipilimumab group versus 34·8% (30·1–39·5) in the 
placebo group. The most common grade 3–4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group were 
gastrointestinal (75 [16%] vs four [<1%] in the placebo group), hepatic (50 [11%] vs one [<1%]), and endocrine (40 [8%] vs 
none). Adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment in 245 (52%) of 471 patients who started ipilimumab 
(182 [39%] during the initial treatment period of four doses). Five patients (1%) died due to drug-related adverse events. 
Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients died because 
of colitis (two with gastrointestinal perforation), one patient because of myocarditis, and one patient because of 
multiorgan failure with Guillain-Barré syndrome. 
Interpretation Adjuvant ipilimumab signiﬁ cantly improved recurrence-free survival for patients with completely 
resected high-risk stage III melanoma. The adverse event proﬁ le was consistent with that observed in advanced 
melanoma, but at higher incidences in particular for endocrinopathies. The risk–beneﬁ t ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab 
at this dose and schedule requires additional assessment based on distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival 
endpoints to deﬁ ne its deﬁ nitive value. 

Introduction 
The rapidly rising incidence of cutaneous melanoma has 
also led to an increased number of patients with regional 
positive lymph nodes (stage III disease) being diagnosed 
each year.1 Breslow thickness, mitotic index, and ulceration 
of primary melanoma are the strongest prognostic factors 
for the presence of micrometastasis in regional lymph 
nodes.2 The likelihood of systemic metastatic disease in 
patients with regional lymph node metastasis is closely 
associated with microscopic versus palpable nodal disease 
and with number of positive nodes.3 In an analysis of 
3307 patients by the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
(AJCC),2 5-year melanoma-speciﬁ c survival was 78% for 
stage IIIA, 59% for stage IIIB, and 40% for stage IIIC 
melanoma. Recurrence at 5 years has been reported to be 
37% in patients with stage IIIA disease, 68% for IIIB 
disease, and 89% for patients with stage IIIC disease.4 
Even within the sentinel node-positive patient population, 
heterogeneity is remarkable and is closely associated with 
tumour load in the sentinel node, as deﬁ ned by the

Rotterdam criteria.5–7 Patients with a metastasis bigger 
than 1 mm have a highly signiﬁ cant increased risk of 
recurrence and death than do patients with a metastasis 
1 mm or smaller.5–7 
Ipilimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that 
blocks CTLA-4 to augment anti-tumour 
immune 
responses, is an approved treatment for advanced 
melanoma because of its eﬀ ect on overall survival.8–10 
The unmet need for an improved adjuvant treatment 
for melanoma is shown by the hazard ratio (HR) for 
recurrence or death of 0·83–0·85 with high-dose or 
low-dose interferon compared with observation only.11 
Interferon is approved in both the USA and the EU as 
an adjuvant therapy for resected melanoma; however, 
the treatment is not widely regarded as the standard of 
care. In the current context of only marginally eﬀ ective 
adjuvant therapies with interferons, without a demon- 
strable dose–response or duration–response eﬀ ect 
in meta-analyses,11–13 the study of ipilimumab in the 
adjuvant setting is appropriate.

patients with stage III cutaneous melanoma after 
having undergone a complete regional lymph node 
dissection. 



Methods 
Study design and patients 
In this multinational, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 
trial done in 91 hospitals located in 19 countries, eligible 
patients were at least 18 years of age and had histologically 
conﬁ rmed melanoma metastatic to lymph nodes only. 
According to the AJCC 2009 (for stage III identical to 
AJCC 2002) classiﬁ cation, patients had to have either 
stage IIIA melanoma (if N1a, at least 1 metastasis 
>1 mm), stage IIIB or stage IIIC, with no in-transit 
metastasis.2 The primary cutaneous melanoma must 
have been completely excised with adequate surgical 
margins. Complete regional 
lympha denectomy was 
required within the 12 weeks before randomisation. 
Exclusion criteria included unknown primary, ocular, or 
mucosal melanoma, Eastern Co operative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status greater than 1, 
autoimmune disease, uncontrolled infections, cardio- 
vascular disease, white blood cell count lower than 
2·5 × 10⁹ cells per L, absolute neutrophil count lower than 
1·0 × 109 cells per L, platelets lower than 75 × 10⁹ cells per 
L, haemoglobin con centration less than 9 g/dL, creatinine 
higher than 2·5 times the upper normal limit, hepatic 
enzymes or lactate dehydrogenase higher than two times 
the upper normal limit, use of systemic corticosteroids, 
and previous systemic therapy for melanoma. 
The protocol (appendix) was approved by the EORTC 
protocol review committee and independent ethics 
committees. The study was done in accordance with the 
ethical principles originating from the Declaration of 
Helsinki and with Good Clinical Practice as deﬁ ned by 
the International Conference on Harmonization. All 
participating patients gave written informed consent. 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 
ipilimumab or placebo (appendix). Registration was 
done centrally at the EORTC head quarters. We used a 
central interactive voice response system (Worldwide 
Clinical Trials, Beverly Hills, CA, USA) for drug 
accountability and central randomisation, based on a 
minimisation technique.14 Patients were stratiﬁ ed by 
disease stage (stage IIIA vs stage IIIB vs stage IIIC with one 
to three positive nodes vs stage IIIC with four or more 
positive nodes) and regions (North America, European 
countries, and Australia). The local pharmacist did the 
randomisation and was unmasked for allocated treatment. 



Systematic review 
The ﬁ nal protocol for this trial was submitted in January, 2008. 
In the preceding 2 years we assessed the scientiﬁ c literature, 
restricted to English language publications, on PubMed 
(1980–2007), on adjuvant therapy in melanoma in patients 
with high risk for recurrence. A simple literature search using 
the search terms “melanoma”, “adjuvant therapy”, and 
“randomised trial” provided all relevant studies. 
Added value of the study 
This trial is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁ rst to assess an 
approved drug with an eﬀ ect on survival in advanced 
melanoma in the adjuvant setting, and the ﬁ rst to study an 
immune checkpoint inhibitor in this setting. Our ﬁ ndings show 
that adjuvant use of ipilimumab has a signiﬁ cant eﬀ ect on 
recurrence-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. 
We noted eﬃ cacy of the treatment across subgroups including 
those with palpable lymph nodes. Nevertheless, our results 
show important side-eﬀ ects, in particular grade 3–4 colitis and 
hypophysitis. Our data neither support nor refute the need for 
maintenance treatment with ipilimumab. However, the eﬀ ect 
on recurrence-free survival is potentially better than that of 
adjuvant interferon. 
Interpretation 
Ipilimumab is an active drug in the adjuvant setting in patients 
with high-risk disease, although side-eﬀ ects are signiﬁ cant. In 
view of its activity across subgroups including those with high 
tumour burden, it represents an option in the current adjuvant 
landscape for those who have experience with administering the 
drug. Overall survival data are not yet mature and will be reported 
in the future. 

Resolution of a grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse 
event was deﬁ ned as an improvement to grade 1 or less, 
or to the worst grade at baseline. Some patients with 
grade 1 adverse events were permitted to receive 
maintenance therapy (criteria shown in protocol). The 
grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse event with the 
longest time to resolution was selected for inclusion in 
the analysis. If the grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse 
event did not resolve, the patient’s follow-up was censored 
at the last known alive date. Similar analyses were 
repeated for grade 2–5 immune-related adverse events. 
Statistical analysis 
512 recurrence-free survival events were required to 
provide 90% power to detect an ipilimumab versus 
placebo HR of 0·75 (two-sided α of 0·05), corresponding 
to an increase from 58·3% to 66·% in 1-year recurrence- 
free survival and from 35·4% to 45·9% in 3-year 
recurrence-free survival. Therefore, 950 patients were 
planned to be randomly assigned. 
Clinical investigators and those collecting or analysing the 
data were masked to treatment group assignment. 

Procedures 
Patients received either 
infusions of 
10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for four doses, then 
every 3 months for up to a maximum of 3 years, or until 
disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, major protocol 
violation, or treatment refusal. After the initial four 
doses (induction) of ipilimumab or placebo, additional

theoretical principles of continued re-stimulation of the 
immune system, consistent with previous studies of 
immunotherapy 
adjuvant melanoma.12 Rules 
regarding the withholding of a dose of ipilimumab or 
placebo and management of immune-related adverse 
events are detailed in the protocol (appendix). 


Patients in both study groups were planned to be 
assessed for recurrence and distant metastases every 
3 months during the ﬁ rst 3 years and every 6 months 
thereafter. Physical examination, chest radiography, CT, 
or other imaging techniques were used as clinically 
indicated. Patients were assessed at baseline during the 
screening phase, within maximum 6 weeks before 
randomisation. Recurrence or metastatic lesions had to 
be histologically conﬁ rmed whenever possible. The 
ﬁ 
 rst date when recurrence was observed irrespective of 
the method of assessment. An independent review 
committee, whose members were kept masked of 
study-group assignments, assessed disease status and 
date of recurrence. 

Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival, as 
assessed by 
review committee. 
independent 
Secondary endpoints were distant-metastasis free survival 
(also assessed by the independent review committee; 
appendix), overall survival, adverse event proﬁ le, and 
health-related quality of life (assessed with EORTC 
QLQ-C30 instrument). Recurrence-free survival was 
deﬁ ned as the time between the date of randomisation 
and the date of ﬁ rst recurrence (local, regional, or distant 
metastasis) or death (whatever the cause), whichever 
occurred ﬁ rst. For patients still alive and without disease 
recurrence, recurrence-free survival was censored on the 
date of last disease assessment. 
We recorded adverse events for each treatment course

December, 2013. As per the recommendation of the data 
and safety monitoring board, the study is ongoing for 
the assessment of distant metastasis-free survival and 
overall survival; both the investigators and the sponsor 
remain masked to these data. All analyses were done 
with SAS software (version 9.2 and 9.3, SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC, USA). This trial is registered with EudraCT, 
number 2007-001974-10, and ClinicalTrials.gov, number 
NCT00636168. 


Role of the funding source 
The funder and the sponsor of the trial was Bristol-Myers 
Squibb. The trial was designed jointly by the members of 
(study coordinator, EORTC 
the writing committee 
Headquarters 
Squibb 
representative). Data were collected and computerised at 
the EORTC Headquarters, and were copied to Bristol- 
Myers Squibb after database lock. Data were analysed 
independently at both the EORTC Headquarters (SS) and 
by Bristol-Myers Squibb (VdP). An initial draft of the 
manuscript was prepared by the study coordinator and the 
EORTC trial statistician. All the authors participated in 
the revision and ﬁ nalisation of the manuscript, and made 
the decision to submit the manuscript for publication. 
After the database lock (ie, at time of ﬁ nal analysis), 
statisticians had full access to all the data; thereafter the 
 rst author (AMME) received the ﬁ nal reports.

Results 
Between July 10, 2008, and Aug 1, 2011, 951 patients 
were randomly assigned (475 in the ipilimumab group 
and 476 in the placebo group). Table 1 shows patient and 
disease characteristics. Overall, 186 (20%) patients had 
stage IIIA, 420 (44%) had stage IIIB, and 345 (36%) had 
stage IIIC disease; 400 (42%) patients had an ulcerated 
primary, and 548 (58%) had macroscopic lymph node 
involvement. 
Six patients did not start the allocated treatment by 
randomisation (ﬁ gure 1). Of the remaining patients, the 
median number of doses received per patient in the 
ipilimumab group was four (range 1–16) and eight 
(range 1–16) in the placebo group. At 
least one 
maintenance dose was received by 198 (42%) of 
471 patients in the ipilimumab and 332 (70%) of 
The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to obtain estimates 
of the recurrence-free survival distributions, and the 
95% CI of these estimates (–1·96 × standard error [SE], 
1·96 × SE), where the SE was computed with the Greenwood 
formula. Medians were presented with a 95% CI based on 
the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. We compared the 
recurrence-free survival distributions of the treatment 
groups with a log-rank test at a two-sided alpha level of 
0·05, stratiﬁ ed by stage as indicated at randomisation. The 
treatment HR for recurrence or death, and its 95% CI, was 
estimated with a Cox proportional hazards model, stratiﬁ ed 
by stage as indicated at randomisation. 
The main analysis of the eﬃ cacy endpoint was by 
intention to treat: all patients were deemed at risk of 
the 
having a recurrence-free survival event until 
respective event was reached; follow-up was not censored 
on purpose for patients who went oﬀ -protocol treatment 
because of, for example, protocol violation, toxicity, and 
treatment refusal. Forest plot analyses and further 
exploratory post-hoc subgroup analyses were used to 
investigate predictive importance of diﬀ erent factors on 
the treatment diﬀ erence (appendix). Safety proﬁ les were 
assessed in patients who started treatment allocated by 
randomisation, and no statistical inferences were done.

ipilimumab was more prominent in the 345 patients with 
stage IIIC disease (of whom 228 [66%] had ulcerated 
melanoma) than in the 420 patients with stage IIIB 
disease (of whom 172 [41%] had ulcerated melanoma), and 
also than in the 196 patients with stage IIIA (none of 
whom had ulcerated melanoma; ﬁ gure 3). In patients 
with microscopic involvement, the eﬀ ect of ipilimumab 
seemed higher than 
in patients with macroscopic 
involvement, as indicated in univariate analyses (ﬁ gure 3) 
and analyses stratiﬁ ed by stage (table 3). 
Sensitivity analyses based on the per-protocol treatment 
population, or using recurrence-free survival as reported by 
the investigators, yielded similar results (appendix), as was 
the case for treatment comparison stratiﬁ ed by stage as 
given on case report forms (HR 0·76, 95% CI 0·64–0·90; 
p=0·002). Patients remain in follow-up for the endpoints of 
distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival. 
In the ipilimumab group, 465 (99%) of 471 patients had 
an adverse event of any grade, with grade 3 or 4 adverse 
474 patients in the placebo group. 136 (29%) of 471 
patients in the ipilimumab group received at least seven 
doses (about 1 year of treatment) compared with 269 
(57%) of 474 in the placebo group. 
Of 471 patients who started ipilimumab, 245 (52%) 
discontinued treatment because of an adverse event, of 
which 230 (49%) were drug-related; in 182 (39%) patients 
the adverse event leading to discontinuation happened 
within 12 weeks of the start of treatment. Of the 
474 patients in the placebo group who received at least 
one dose of assigned treatment, 20 (4%) discontinued 
treatment because of an adverse event (ﬁ gure 1). 
132 (28%) patients discontinued ipilimumab because of 
disease recurrence compared with 273 (58%) patients in 
the placebo group. 33 (7%) patients in the ipilimumab 
group and 77 (16%) in the placebo group completed the 
entire 3-year treatment period; 39 (8%) patients in the 
ipilimumab group and 80 (17%) in the placebo group 
were still on treatment on July 26, 2013, the date of 
clinical cutoﬀ , respectively (ﬁ gure 1). No dose reductions 
or modiﬁ cations were made. The overall median follow- 
up was 2·74 years (IQR 2·28–3·22), 2·60 years 
(2·10–3·07) in the ipilimumab group and 2·76 years 
(2·29–3·26) in the placebo group. 
528 recurrence-free survival events were reported 
(234 in the ipilimumab group and 294 in the placebo 
group). Recurrence-free survival was signiﬁ cantly longer 
in the ipilimumab group than in the placebo group (HR, 
stratiﬁ ed by stage, 0·75, 95% CI 0·64–0·90; p=0·0013; 
table 2 and ﬁ gure 2). Median recurrence-free survival in 
the ipilimumab group was 26·1 months (95% CI 
19·3–39·3) versus 17·1 months (13·4–21·6) in the 
placebo group; 3-year recurrence-free survival was 46·5% 
(95% CI 41·5–51·3) in the ipilimumab group versus 
34·8% (30·1–39·5) in the placebo group. 
The eﬀ ect of ipilimumab on recurrence-free survival 
was consistent across subgroups (ﬁ gure 3). An eﬀ ect on 
recurrence-free survival was noted irrespective of the 
number of positive lymph nodes (ﬁ gure 3), and seemed to 
be higher in patients with an ulcerated melanoma than in 
patients with a non-ulcerated melanoma, as suggested by 
univariate analyses (present vs absent; test of heterogeneity 
p=0·20; ﬁ gure 3) and analyses stratiﬁ ed by stage (table 3), 
and conﬁ rmed by multivariate analyses (appendix).

events in 254 (54%) patients; 432 (91%) of 474 patients in 
the placebo group had an adverse event of any grade, with 
grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in 118 (25%) patients 
(table 4). On-study immune-related adverse events were 
more frequently reported in the ipilimumab group than 
in the placebo group (table 4). The most common grade 
3–4 immune-related adverse events in the ipilimumab 
group were gastro intestinal, hepatic, and endocrine in 
nature (table 4). For all classes, most patients had only 
one episode of a grade 3–4 immune-related adverse event. 
The median time to onset of on-study grade 2–5 immune- 
related adverse events in the ipilimumab group ranged 
from 4·3 weeks (IQR 1·1–10·6; skin immune-related 
adverse events) to 13·1 weeks (8·3–77·3; neurological 
immune-related adverse events; appendix). In 
the 
ipilimumab group, excluding endocrine immune-related 
adverse events, most grade 2–4 immune-related adverse 
events (82–95%) resolved to baseline or grade 1 with 
established management algorithms (protocol). The 
median time to resolution ranged from 4·0 to 8·0 weeks. 
Endocrine immune-related adverse events resolved in a 
smaller proportion of ipilimumab-treated patients (75 
[56%] of 134 patients) and took longer to resolve (median 
31·1 weeks, IQR 8·3–77·3). 
Five (1%) participants died because of drug-related 
adverse events in the ipilimumab group; three patients 
(two with gastrointestinal 
died because of colitis 
perforation), one patient because of myocarditis, and one

Discussion 
Our data show that 10 mg/kg ipilimumab for up to 3 
years as adjuvant treatment in patients with adequate 
resection of lymph nodes and high-risk stage III 
melanoma 
recurrence-free 
survival, the primary endpoint of the trial, compared 
with use of adjuvant placebo. Patients remain in follow- 
up for the secondary endpoints of distant metastasis- 
free survival and overall survival. 



The dose of 10 mg/kg was chosen based on data from 
a randomised phase 2 trial15 that compared various 
doses of 
in patients with advanced 
melanoma, showing the best results with 10 mg/kg. 
This dose is substantially higher than the approved dose 
of 3 mg/kg for the treatment of patients with advanced 
melanoma.8 The ongoing intergroup trial ECOG 1609 
(NCT 01274338) in the USA comparing high-dose 
interferon treatment with 1 year of treatment with 
ipilimumab at either 10 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg might 
provide additional insight as to whether the higher dose 
of ipilimumab provides additional beneﬁ ts compared 
with the standard dose of 
ipilimumab used for 
unresectable metastatic disease, and whether either 
dose of ipilimumab improves outcomes or is less toxic 
than high-dose interferon. 

Recently, several predictive factors for the eﬃ cacy of 
interferon 
for high-risk 
the adjuvant setting 
melanoma have been identiﬁ ed. In the EORTC 18952 
trial, which compared intermediate doses of interferon 
as adjuvant treatment with observation, and in the 
EORTC 18991 trial of adjuvant pegylated interferon 
versus observation, patients were stratiﬁ ed by nodal 
status: microscopic only (sentinel node-positive) versus 
macroscopic or palpable, and by the presence of 
ulceration of 
the primary.16–18 The 
importance of 
microscopic versus macroscopic nodal involvement and 
the presence or absence of ulceration of the primary 
have been clearly shown in a meta-analysis of these two 
trials in 2644 patients19 and was conﬁ rmed by long-term 
data—ie, overall survival in the EORTC 18991 trial.18 
Moreover, the overriding importance of ulceration has 
been shown in an individual patient data meta-analysis 
of 15 trials of adjuvant interferon versus observation.11 
We noted similar trends in this trial. Analyses, 
stratiﬁ ed by stage at randomisation, suggested that 
patients with microscopic involvement only might have 
a greater beneﬁ t than patients with palpable nodes. But 
importantly, with ipilimumab, the beneﬁ t was still 
substantial in the latter subgroup, whereas this was not 
the case in the EORTC interferon trials. Similarly, 
patients with an ulcerated melanoma seemed to beneﬁ t 
from ipilimumab more than patients with a non- 
ulcerated primary. By contrast with interferon, the eﬀ ect 
of ipilimumab is still substantial in the latter subgroup. 
When 
important determinants were 
combined, analyses stratiﬁ ed by stage suggested that the 
beneﬁ t in patients with microscopic nodal involvement 


with an ulcerated primary appeared greatest, followed by 
that observed in patients with palpable nodes with an 
ulcerated primary, or in patients with microscopic nodal 
involvement and an non-ulcerated primary, whereas in 
patients with palpable nodes and a non-ulcerated 
primary the beneﬁ t was the lowest (table 3). 
In patients with stage IIIA disease with limited 
microscopic nodal involvement, who, by deﬁ nition, have 
a non-ulcerated primary, there was a suggestion of only 
limited beneﬁ t (HR 0·91, 99% CI 0·49–1·68), whereas in 
those with stage IIIB (HR 0·61, 0·35–1·04) or IIIC (HR 
0·42, 0·16–1·12) the eﬀ ect was important (appendix). 
These observations suggest that ulcerated melanoma is a 
separate biological entity, for which a number of 
additional observations have been reported in terms of 
stromal components, gene proﬁ ling, and immune- 
suppressed status of associated sentinel nodes.20–23 
The adverse event proﬁ le of ipilimumab in the adjuvant 
setting is substantial, resulting in around 40% of patients 
discontinuing treatment by the end of the initial dosing 
period—ie, before maintenance therapy. This is a higher 
frequency than has been observed in a pooled analysis of 
studies with the dose of 10 mg/kg in patients with advanced 
melanoma.10 Whether this is due to longer drug exposure, 
or to a greater sensitivity in stage III disease remains 
speculative. Most immune-related dermatological, gastro- 
intestinal, and hepatic manifestations resolved within 
4–6 weeks, but for endocrinopathies the median time to 
resolution was 31 weeks, with 59 (44%) of 134 patients 
remaining on hormone replacement therapies. Of concern 
are the drug-related fatalities in the ipilimumab group. 
Eﬀ ective management of ipilimumab-related immune- 
related adverse events is complex and requires proactive 
monitoring, early intervention, and aggressive immuno- 
suppressive management and meticulous instruction of 
patients. Of note, of the ﬁ ve (1%) patients who died due to 
drug-related causes after discontinuation of ipilimumab, 
four received corticosteroids and only one received anti- 
TNF antibodies; we do not know whether the lack of 
administration of corticosteroids in one patient and of 
anti-TNF antibodies in four patients would have changed 
the outcome. 
Adjuvant ipilimumab therapy for patients with high- 
risk stage III melanoma clearly improves recurrence-free 
survival. We noted eﬃ cacy of the treatment across 
subgroups including those with high tumour burden. 
The risk–beneﬁ t ratio of adjuvant ipilimumab at this dose 
and schedule requires additional assessment based on 
distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival 
endpoints to deﬁ ne its deﬁ nitive value.
