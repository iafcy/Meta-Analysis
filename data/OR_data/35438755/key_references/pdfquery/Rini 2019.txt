Summary 
Background A phase 2 trial showed improved progression-free survival for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus 
sunitinib in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who express programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Here, we 
report results of IMmotion151, a phase 3 trial comparing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in first- 
line metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
Methods In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial, patients with a component of clear cell 
or sarcomatoid histology and who were previously untreated, were recruited from 152 academic medical centres and 
community oncology practices in 21 countries, mainly in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region, and 
were randomly assigned 1:1 to either atezolizumab 1200 mg plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously once every 
3 weeks or sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off. A permuted-block randomisation (block size 
of 4) was applied to obtain a balanced assignment to each treatment group with respect to the stratification factors. 
Study investigators and participants were not masked to treatment allocation. Patients, investigators, independent 
radiology committee members, and the sponsor were masked to PD-L1 expression status. Co-primary endpoints were 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the PD-L1 positive population and overall survival in the intention- 
to-treat (ITT) population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02420821. 
Findings Of 915 patients enrolled between May 20, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016, 454 were randomly assigned to the 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 461 to the sunitinib group. 362 (40%) of 915 patients had PD-L1 positive 
disease. Median follow-up was 15 months at the primary progression-free survival analysis and 24 months at the 
overall survival interim analysis. In the PD-L1 positive population, the median progression-free survival was 
11·2 months in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group versus 7·7 months in the sunitinib group (hazard ratio 
[HR] 0·74 [95% CI 0·57–0·96]; p=0·0217). In the ITT population, median overall survival had an HR of 0·93 
(0·76–1·14) and the results did not cross the significance boundary at the interim analysis. 182 (40%) of 451 patients 
in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 240 (54%) of 446 patients in the sunitinib group had treatment- 
related grade 3–4 adverse events: 24 (5%) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 37 (8%) in the sunitinib 
group had treatment-related all-grade adverse events, which led to treatment-regimen discontinuation. 
Interpretation Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab prolonged progression-free survival versus sunitinib in patients with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma and showed a favourable safety profile. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to establish 
whether a survival benefit will emerge. These study results support atezolizumab plus bevacizumab as a first-line 
treatment option for selected patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. 


Introduction 
In patients with locally advanced or metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma, tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), such as 
sunitinib, have been the first-line standard of care for 
the past decade.1–3 However, many patients have disease 
that is inherently resistant to these approaches, and 
almost all patients acquire resistance over time.4 
Efficacy is particularly low in some patient subgroups, 
including cases with a sarcomatoid differentiation5 
and disease expressing programmed death-ligand 1 
(PD-L1).6–8 Additionally, the use of these drugs can be 
limited by adverse events, such as diarrhoea, fatigue, 
palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia, and mucositis,

which impair patients’ quality of life,9,10 underscoring a 
need for new therapeutic targets and drug combinations 
for patients with meta static renal cell carcinoma. 
Treatment with check point inhibitors, including the 
anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab, has resulted in 
durable responses and improvements in overall survival 
in pre-treated patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma.7,11,12 
Bevacizumab binds to VEGF and is approved in 
combination with interferon alfa for metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma.13 In addition to its antiangiogenic effects,14 
VEGF blockade by bevacizumab modulates the immune 
environment, including enhancing T-cell priming and 
activation via promotion of dendritic cell maturation,15,16 
increasing T-cell tumour infiltration by normalising 
tumour vasculature,17,18 and establishing an immune- 
permissive tumour microenvironment by decreasing 
myeloid-derived suppressor-cell and regulatory T-cell 
populations.18,19 Therefore, T-cell-mediated cancer-cell 
killing by atezolizumab could be enhanced through 
reversal of VEGF-mediated immunosuppression mech- 
anisms by the addition of bevacizumab.20 
Objective responses for atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
were first observed in a phase 1b study18 in metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma. Subsequently, a phase 2 study11 assessed 
atezolizumab alone and in combination with bevacizumab 
versus sunitinib. Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
improved progression-free survival and the proportion of 
patients who achieved an objective response versus 
sunitinib in the subgroup of patients with disease 
expressing PD-L1. Atezolizumab also showed antitumour 
activity when administered as a single drug, supporting 
complementary activity of bevacizumab plus atezolizumab 
in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
We report the primary analysis of the efficacy and safety 
of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in the 
IMmotion151 study, the first randomised, phase 3 trial 
combining an anti-PD-L1–PD-1 antibody with an anti- 
VEGF drug as treatment for patients with metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma. 




Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed and international congress presentations 
pertaining to studies in metastatic renal cell carcinoma between 
May 1, 2010, and May 1, 2015, for articles published in English 
with MeSH search terms “metastatic” AND “kidney cancer”, 
“renal cell carcinoma”, “programmed cell death 1”, “PD-1”, 
“programmed cell death ligand 1”, and “PD-L1”. We identified an 
unmet clinical need for effective and tolerable approaches to the 
treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
Approved therapies in the first-line metastatic setting included 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib and pazopanib, 
and the combination of the vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) inhibitor bevacizumab with interferon alfa-2a; however, 
these therapies are associated with considerable morbidity due 
to adverse events and do not result in a sustained, durable 
clinical benefit. Additionally, elevated programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumour-infiltrating 
immune cells is often associated with a worse prognosis in renal 
cell carcinoma. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as atezolizumab, 
nivolumab, and pembrolizumab, target the PD-L1 or 
programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway and represent 
an attractive strategy to reinvigorate tumour-specific T-cell 
immunity. Despite numerous advancements, metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma remains a largely incurable disease because a 
substantial majority of patients develop resistance to standard 
therapies, including VEGF-directed drugs or immunotherapy. 
Therefore, an ongoing need exists for more-efficacious and 
better-tolerated treatments. Collectively, the role of VEGF in the 
immune response and its crucial role in renal cell carcinoma 
pathogenesis provide a compelling rationale to test whether 
dual inhibition of the PD-L1–PD-1 and VEGF pathways will result 
in improved clinical benefit for patients with metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma. 
Added value of this study 
The IMmotion151 trial met its coprimary endpoint, showing 
improved investigator-assessed progression-free survival with 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in patients 
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose disease expressed 
PD-L1. Clinical efficacy is further supported by higher objective 
response rates, especially complete response rates, 
with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib 
treatment. Overall survival did not cross the significance 
boundary, and longer-term follow-up is necessary to establish 
whether a survival benefit will emerge. Patients given 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab had improved progression-free 
survival regardless of the clinical risk group examined, including 
patients with previous nephrectomy, sarcomatoid histology, 
and established prognostic risk scores, including patients with 
favourable prognostic risk. The combination of atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab was shown to have a tolerable safety profile 
consistent with previous studies and was associated with fewer 
high-grade treatment-related adverse events and a lower 
regimen discontinuation rate versus sunitinib, and low 
corticosteroid use. Additionally, patients reported a delay in 
symptom interference with daily living when given 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib. Results 
support the clinical activity of checkpoint inhibitor-based 
combinations in first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Given that both the VEGF and PD-L1 pathways are important 
in renal cell carcinoma pathogenesis, concomitant inhibition 
of VEGF signalling might enhance the efficacy of 
immunotherapy in the front-line treatment of patients with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Results from this study and 
others support this hypothesis. 
Methods 
Study design and participants 
We did a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised 
controlled trial at 152 academic medical centres and 
community oncology practices in 21 countries, mainly 
in Europe, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region 
(Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, 
Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, 
Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, UK, and USA; 
appendix). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic renal 
cell carcinoma with any component of clear cell or 
sarcomatoid histology (per local pathology report), 
measurable disease according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), 
Karnofsky perfor mance status 70% or higher, adequate 
haem atological and end-organ function, and tumour 
tissue available for PD-L1 testing. Patients were excluded 
if they had received previous systemic treatment or if 
they had untreated brain metastases. A full list of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria is available in the 
appendix. All patients gave written informed consent. 
The study protocol (appendix) was approved by the 
institutional review board or independent ethics com- 
mittee for each study site and was done in full accordance 
with the Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the 
Declaration of Helsinki. 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive 
voice and web response system to receive atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab or sunitinib. A permuted-block ran- 
domisation (block size of 4) was applied to obtain a 
balanced assignment to each treatment group with respect 
to the stratification factors, including PD-L1 expression 
immune cells 
(<1% vs ≥1% of 
expressing PD-L1 as assessed by immuno histochemistry 
[VENTANA PD-L1 SP142 assay; Ventana Medical Systems, 
Tucson, AZ]), presence of liver metastasis (yes vs no), and 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)

enrolled the patients. The study was open label, and 
investigators and participants were not masked to 
treatment allocation. Patients, investigators, independent 
radiology committee (IRC) members, and the sponsor 
were masked to PD-L1 expression status. The sponsor was 
not permitted to carry out any population-level summaries 
of outcome data by treatment group until the time of 
primary analysis. 
Procedures 
Patients randomly assigned to the atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab group received atezolizumab 1200 mg 
intravenously then bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenous 
infusions once every 3 weeks. Patients randomly assigned 
to the sunitinib group received sunitinib 50 mg once 
daily orally for 4 weeks, followed by 2 weeks of rest. 
Atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and sunitinib were provided 
by the sponsor, except when sunitinib was procured as 
local commercial product in some countries (Japan, USA, 
and Canada). Patients could continue atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab or sunitinib beyond disease progression 
according to RECIST 1.1 and the investigator’s discretion 
if evidence of clinical benefit was observed. No prespecified 
crossover was planned per protocol. 
Patients had tumour assessments at baseline, week 12, 
and then every 6 weeks up to week 78, followed by every 
12 weeks thereafter, until disease progression according to 
RECIST 1.1 or loss of clinical benefit. Survival follow-up 
occurred every 3 months after treatment dis continuation. 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events version 4.0 was used to assess frequency 
and severity of adverse events. 
Symptom severity for 17 symptoms and symptom 
interference with activities of daily living were captured 
by the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), 
which patients completed before initiating treatment 
(baseline), on day 1 and day 22 of each cycle, at end of 
treatment, and during survival follow-up. The range for 
each symptom severity and symptom interference score 
is 0–10, with higher scores indicating greater symptom 
severity and interference. Time to clinically relevant 
deterioration of day-to-day functioning was based on a 
2-point or higher increase above baseline on the six-item 
MDASI interference subscale, where patients rated how 
much their symptoms interfered with work, general 
activity, walking, enjoyment of life, mood, and relations 
with other people.22 

Outcomes 
Co-primary endpoints were progression-free survival 
(RECIST 1.1) by investigator assessment in patients 
with PD-L1 positive disease (defined as ≥1% expression 
on 
immune cells) and overall 
survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Key 
secondary objectives included overall survival in the 
PD-L1 positive population, progression-free survival in 
the ITT population, the proportion of patients who 
achieved an objective response, duration of response, 
patient-reported outcomes, and safety. Radiographic 
endpoints were also assessed by an IRC. A complete list 
of outcomes is reported in the protocol (see appendix). 
Statistical analysis 
We randomly assigned 915 patients, including 362 patients 
with a PD-L1 immunohistochemistry tumour-infiltrating 
immune cell score of 1% or higher. The type 1 error () for 
the entire study is 0·05 (two-sided), which we split 
between the co-primary endpoints of progression-free 
survival in patients with PD-L1 positive disease (=0·04) 
and overall survival in the ITT population (=0·01) to

If progression-free survival was significant, we recycled 
the =0·04 to the overall survival in the ITT poulation.23,24 
We defined the ITT population as all randomly assigned 
patients regardless of whether they received the assigned 
study treatment. We defined the PD-L1 positive population 
as patients in the ITT population whose PD-L1 expression 
was 1% or higher on tumour-infiltrating immune cells at 
the time of randomisation. We assessed progression-free 
survival in patients with PD-L1 positive disease at an 
 level of 0·04, with a power of 90% based on a target 
hazard ratio (HR) of 0·65 under the stratified log-rank 
test. We then back-calculated the total number of patients 
based on the number of events required. The primary 
analysis of progression-free survival was triggered by 
236 progression-free survival events (65% event-to-patient 
ratio) in the PD-L1 positive population (362 patients) at the 
projected data cutoff date of Sept 29, 2017. The co-primary 
endpoint of progression-free survival was met; therefore, 
the  level for overall survival testing was 0·05. We 
planned the first interim analysis of overall survival at the 
time of progression-free survival primary analysis. We 
used an adjusted  level of 0·0009 for the first interim 
analysis of overall survival based on an O’Brien-Fleming  
spending function calculated on the number of overall 
survival events.25 We added a second interim analysis 
of overall survival to the protocol after the primary 
progression-free survival analysis to fulfil health authority

requirements. We did the second interim overall survival 
analysis approximately 10 months after the first interim 
analysis, with an adjusted  level of 0·0076 based on an 
O’Brien-Fleming  spending function calculated on the 
number of overall survival events. We did not update any 
other study endpoints at that time. We compared 
treatment groups for progression-free survival and overall 
survival using a two-sided, stratified log-rank test. We 
used stratified Cox regression models to estimate HRs 
and 95% CIs. We assessed the proportional hazards 
assumption of the Cox regression model and no evidence 
of violation was observed. We provide p values for results 
other than the co-primary endpoints for descriptive 
purposes only. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to 
estimate survival curves and time to patient-reported 
deterioration in symptom interference. We estimated 
patient-reported symptom-severity score changes from 
baseline up to end of treat ment and differences between 
groups using linear mixed-effects models. We assessed 
safety analyses, including summaries of adverse events, in 
patients who received any amount of any component of 
study treatment. 
Statistical analyses were done using SAS version 9.4. 
Full details of the statistical plan are included in the 
appendix. An independent data monitoring committee 
reviewed safety data during the study on a periodic basis 
(approximately every 6 months). This trial is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02420821.

Results 
The study enrolled 915 patients in the ITT population 
between May 20, 2015, and Oct 12, 2016, at 152 sites across 
21 countries; 454 patients were randomly assigned to 
receive atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 461 patients 
to receive sunitinib (figure 1). A total of 362 (40%) of 
915 patients had PD-L1 positive tumours. Baseline 
characteristics were well balanced between study groups 
and between the PD-L1 positive and ITT populations 
(table 1). Overall, 142 (16%) patients had tumours with a 
component of sarcomatoid differentiation. At data cutoff 
for the primary progression-free analysis, the minimum 
survival follow-up was 12 months (median survival follow- 
up was 16 months in the PD-L1 positive population and 
15 months in the and ITT population). 
Of 362 patients with PD-L1 positive disease, 243 (67%) 
had disease progression or died. The study met the co- 
primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression- 
free survival, with a median progression-free survival 
of 11·2 months with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
and 7·7 months with sunitinib; stratified HR was 
0·74 (95% CI 0·57–0·96; p=0·0217). At 12 months, 
progression-free survival was 49% (41–56) with atezoli- 
zumab plus bevacizumab versus 38% (31–45) with 
sunitinib (figure 2A; appendix). 76 (43%) of 178 patients 
(35–50) achieved a confirmed objective response in the 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group, with 16 (9%) 
achieving a complete response; 64 (35%) of 184 patients 
(28–42) in the sunitinib group achieved a confirmed 
objective response, with eight (4%) patients achieving a 
complete response (table 2). At the data cutoff, 49 (64%) 
of 76 responses in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
group and 34 (53%) of 64 responses in the sunitinib 
group were ongoing (table 2; appendix). 
In the ITT population, 592 (65%) of 915 patients had 
disease progression or death. Progression-free survival 
benefit was also identified in the atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab group (median progression-free survival 
was 11·2 months) versus the sunitinib group (8·4 months) 
in the ITT population; stratified HR was 0·83 (95% CI 
0·70–0·97). At 12 months, 196 (48%) of 454 patients 
(43–53) in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group had 
progression-free survival versus 166 (41%) of 461 patients 
(36–45) in the sunitinib group (figure 2B; appendix). 
166 (37%) of 454 patients (32–41) in the atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab group achieved a confirmed objective 
response in the ITT population, with 24 (5%) achieving a 
complete response; and 153 (33%) of 461 patients (29–38) 
in the sunitinib group achieved a confirmed objective 
response, with 10 (2%) achieving a complete response 
(table 2). At the data cutoff, 107 (64%) of 166 responses

in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 
90 (59%) of 153 responses in the sunitinib group were 
ongoing (table 2; appendix). 
Progression-free survival benefit was observed with 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib in 
patients across key clinical subgroups, including MSKCC 
risk groups, sarcomatoid histology, liver metastasis, and 
previous nephrectomy (figure 3A; appendix). Notably, the 
progression-free survival HR in patients with sarcomatoid 
histology was 0·46 (95% CI 0·28–0·78) in the PD-L1 
positive population and 0·56 (0·38–0·83) in the ITT 
population. In this subgroup of the ITT population, 
33 (49%) of 68 patients achieved an objective response 
with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus ten (14%) of 
74 patients with sunitinib. Progression-free survival was 
also analysed by extent of PD-L1 status, showing a 
gradient of increasing benefit with increasing PD-L1 
expression (figure 3B). 
Radiographic efficacy endpoints were also assessed by an 
IRC as a secondary endpoint. IRC-assessed progression- 
free survival resulted in a stratified HR of 0·93 (95% CI 
0·72–1·21) in the PD-L1 positive population and 0·88 
(0·74–1·04) in the ITT population when comparing the 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group versus the sunitinib 
group. Notably, in the IRC analysis, patients with PD-L1 
negative disease (PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating 
immune 
cell immunohistochemistry expression <1%) unexpectedly 
showed an improved HR (0·84 [0·67–1·04]) compared 
with patients with PD-L1 positive disease (appendix). In 
the PD-L1 positive population, 36% (64 of 178) of patients 
achieved an objective response with atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab and 33% (60 of 184) with sunitinib, including 
15% (26 of 178) who achieved a complete response 
with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 8% (15 of 184) 
with sunitinib (appendix). Progressive disease event con- 
cordance rates between investigator and IRC assessment 
were high at approximately 80% and were similar between 
the PD-L1 positive and ITT populations and between both 
treatment groups. 
No imbalances in progressive disease event con- 
cordance between treatment groups were observed in the 
ITT population. However, numerically more patients had 
disease progression according to IRC assessment than 
with investigator assessment in the atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab group (n=22) than in the sunitinib group 
(n=10) of the PD-L1 positive population. The difference 
between groups was primarily caused by disease 
progression with appearance of new lesions (most 
commonly in lymph nodes) in the atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab group, while the total number of target 
lesion and non-target lesion progression events was 
similar between groups (appendix). The difference 
between the IRC progressive disease event and the last 
investigator assessment or death exceeded 6 months in 
approximately 50% of the patients and 12 months in 
approximately 20% of patients. Most of these patients 
were still on study at data cutoff.

receiving subsequent systemic cancer therapy in the 
sunitinib group, approximately half received treatment 
with a PD-L1–PD-1 inhibitor (appendix). 
At the data cutoff for the second overall survival interim

(figure 2D). The results did not cross the prespecified 
significance boundary of =0·0076, and survival follow- 
up is continuing to the next planned survival analyses. In 
the PD-L1 positive population, 74 (42%) of 178 patients in 
the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group and 83 (45%) 
of 184 patients in the sunitinib group had died at data

had received a PD-L1–PD-1 inhibitor as second-line

bevacizumab versus sunitinib had fewer treatment- 
related grade 3–4 adverse events (182 [40%] of 451 vs 
240 [54%] of 446) and had fewer treatment regimen 
discontinuations due 
treatment-related adverse 
events (24 [5%] vs 37 [8%]); in the atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab group, additional patients had adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of one component 
of the study treatment (atezolizumab, nine 
[2%]; 
bevacizumab, 23 [5%]). The median time to treatment 
discontinuation for atezolizumab and bevacizumab was 
12 months. The most common grade 3–4 treatment- 
related adverse event 
the atezolizumab plus 
in 
bevacizumab group was hypertension (63 [14%]); in the 
sunitinib group, hypertension (75 [17%]), thrombocyto- 
penia (24 [5%]), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
(40 [9%]) occurred most commonly (appendix). Treat- 
ment-related adverse events occurring with more than 
5% difference between treatment groups are shown in 
figure 4A. Five treatment-related deaths occurred in the 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group, and one death 
occurred in the sunitinib group. The most common 
adverse events of special interest were rash, hypo- 
thyroidism, hyper thyroidism, and liver function test 
low grade 
abnormalities, with most events being 
(appendix). 74 (16%) of 451 patients given atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab received systemic corticosteroids and 
42 (9%) received high-dose systemic corticosteroids 
within 30 days of an adverse event of special interest 
(high-dose systemic corticosteroid use was defined as 
prednisone ≥40 mg per day or equivalent). 
Among all randomly assigned patients, 386 (86%) of 
451 patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
group and 369 (83%) of 446 patients in the sunitinib 
group completed the MDASI at baseline. The proportion 
of patients who completed the MDASI until cycle 7 
day 22 (week 57), when day-22 clinic visits were 
no longer required for patients receiving sunitinib, 
were similar between groups (both ≥70%). In the 
ITT population, median time to clinically relevant 
deterioration of daily functioning due to treatment- 
related and disease-related symptoms was signifi- 
cantly longer in patients receiving atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab (11·3 months) than in patients receiving 
sunitinib (4·3 months); stratified HR was 0·56 (95% CI 
0·46 to 0·68; figure 4B). Change from baseline to end of 
treatment in symptom severity favoured atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab over sunitinib for 17 symptoms: 
lack of appetite, rash or skin change, diarrhoea, mouth 
or throat sores, dry mouth, nausea, fatigue, sad feelings, 
vomiting, shortness of breath, distress, drowsiness, 
disturbed sleep, pain, numbness or tingling, difficulty

highest difference in least-squares mean change (–1·19

symptoms reported by patients during study treatment 
are displayed in figure 4C. 

Discussion 
This phase 3 study met its co-primary endpoint by 
improved progression-free survival with 
showing 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab over sunitinib 
in 
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma whose 
disease expressed PD-L1. Clinical efficacy is supported 
by a higher proportion of patients in the atezolizumab 
plus bevacizumab group achieving an objective response 
than those in the sunitinib group, most notably the 
proportion achieving a complete response. The observed 
progression-free survival benefit of atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab extended across different examined clinical 
groups, including previous nephrectomy, sarcomatoid 
histology, and established prognostic risk groups. 
In the primary analysis, IRC-assessed progression-free 
survival was generally consistent with investigator- 
assessed progression-free survival in the ITT population. 
However, progression-free survival results differed in 
the PD-L1 positive population. Notably, investigators and 
IRC reviewers were masked to patient PD-L1 status, 
suggesting that an evaluation bias limited to this 
subgroup was unlikely. Sensitivity analyses indicated that 
patients with progressive disease according to IRC, but 
not investigator, in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab 
group were key contributors to the difference observed in 
the PD-L1 positive population. Among the 22 patients in 
this subgroup, identification of new lesions was the 
primary reason that led to differing progressive disease 
assessments. Lymph nodes were the most common site 
of new lesions, a finding that might, in part, reflect the 
mode of action of immunotherapy rather than clinically 
relevant disease progression. Half of these patients had 
been followed up for more than 6 months beyond IRC- 
assessed progressive disease, with stable or decreasing 
target lesions according to both IRC and investigator, an 
observation that supports continued disease control and 
treatment benefit. 
For the second overall survival interim analysis, 
386 (42%) of 915 patients had experienced an overall 
survival event at data cutoff. Results did not cross the 
prespecified  boundary, and the study will continue 
until the next planned survival analyses. Differing HRs 
for the two overall survival interim analyses highlight the 
need for more mature survival data to establish whether 
a survival benefit will emerge. 
Progression-free survival and response benefit was 
observed in the context of a favourable safety profile 
with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus sunitinib. 
The safety profile was consistent with previous studies,11 
and no new or additive safety signals were identified. 
Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with 
fewer severe treatment-related adverse events, a lower 
regimen discontinuation rate, and low need for cortico- 
steroid use. Except for proteinuria, a well described 
adverse event associated with bevacizumab treatment, 
all treatment-related adverse events were reported 
more commonly in the sunitinib group, including 



gastro intestinal and skin adverse events often associated 
with quality-of-life impairment. Results of the prespecified 
patient-reported outcomes analyses further supported 
this finding. A meaningful interference of symptoms 
with patients’ daily functioning occurred significantly 
later in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group than 
the sunitinib group, with a 7-month median delay. The 
median time to symptom interference with daily living 
coincided with median progression-free survival with 
atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, whereas patients in the 
sunitinib group had functional impairment significantly 
earlier than radiographic progression. In addition, 
patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group 
reported milder treatment-related and disease-related 
symptoms than those in the sunitinib group. 
Results reported here corroborate the clinical activity of 
PD-L1–PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor-based combinations in 
previously untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma, as 
published for the combinations of nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab and avelumab plus axitinib.8,26 Although 
cross-trial comparisons are limited by study design and 
patient populations, results from these investigations 
add to the growing evidence of PD-L1 expression on 
either tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells 
being associated with enriched clinical benefit with 
checkpoint inhibition and negative prognostic value in 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma.6,7,27,28 


immune 
cells was previously reported to be strongly associated 
with expression of T-effector and interferon gamma 
gene signatures, a hallmark of pre-existing antitumoural 
immunity.11 A consistent pattern of improved progression- 
free survival with increasing levels of PD-L1 tumour- 
infiltrating immune cell expression was observed in 
IMmotion151. This finding underscores the relevance 
of pre-existing immunity in differentiating the clinical 
activity of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus 
sunitinib and substantiates PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 
as a supporting tool for treatment selection in patients 
with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab 
showed improved overall survival and objective response 
in patients with intermediate and poor prognostic risk 
as assessed by the International Metastatic Renal Cell 
Carcinoma Database Consortium score, whereas patients 
with favourable risk showed numerically superior 
results for overall survival, progression-free survival, and 
objective response with sunitinib.8 The results reported 
here, with combined VEGF and checkpoint inhibition, 
corroborated by phase 3 results for avelumab plus 
axitinib,26 suggest a progression-free survival benefit 
across prognostic risk groups, including in patients with 
favourable prognostic risk. 
Additionally, this trial showed substantial efficacy in 
patients with a sarcomatoid histology component, a 
patient group with a particularly poor prognosis and 
limited response to VEGF inhibition.29 PD-L1 expression 
was enhanced in this histological subgroup, with 
86 (61%) of 142 patients expressing PD-L1. However, 
patients in the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab group 
showed improved progression-free survival and a higher 
proportion achieved a response compared with those in 
the sunitinib group, with and without PD-L1 expression, 
supporting an independent predictive value of histology. 
In summary, this trial showed a progression-free survival 
advantage with the combination of atezolizumab plus 
bevacizumab over sunitinib in patients with previously 
untreated metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with a favourable 
safety profile. Overall survival did not cross the significance 
boundary, and longer-term follow-up is necessary to 
establish whether a survival benefit will emerge.
