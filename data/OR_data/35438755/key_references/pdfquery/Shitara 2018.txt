Summary 
Background Patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer that progresses on chemotherapy 
have poor outcomes. We compared pembrolizumab with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric or gastro- 
oesophageal junction cancer that progressed on first-line chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine. 
Methods This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study was done at 148 medical centres in 30 countries. Eligible patients 
were randomised (1:1) in blocks of four per stratum with an interactive voice-response and integrated web-response 
system to receive either pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or standard-dose paclitaxel. Primary 
endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with a programmed cell death ligand 1 
(PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or higher. Safety was assessed in all patients, irrespective of CPS. The 
significance threshold for overall survival was p=0·0135 (one-sided). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT02370498. 
Findings Between June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016, 592 patients were enrolled. Of the 395 patients who had a PD-L1 CPS 
of 1 or higher, 196 patients were assigned to receive pembrolizumab and 199 patients were assigned to receive paclitaxel. 
As of Oct 26, 2017, 326 patients in the population with CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 196 patients in the 
pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Median overall survival was 9·1 months 
(95% CI 6·2–10·7) with pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (7·6–9·0) with paclitaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 
0·66–1·03; one-sided p=0·0421). Median progression-free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 1·4–2·0) with pembrolizumab 
and 4·1 months (3·1–4·2) with paclitaxel (HR 1·27, 95% CI 1·03–1·57). In the total population, grade 3–5 treatment- 
related adverse events occurred in 42 (14%) of the 294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 96 (35%) of the 
276 patients treated with paclitaxel. 
Interpretation Pembrolizumab did not significantly improve overall survival compared with paclitaxel as second-line 
therapy for advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer with PD-L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Pembrolizumab 
had a better safety profile than paclitaxel. Additional trials of pembrolizumab in gastric and gastro-oesophageal 
cancer are ongoing. 


Introduction 
Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and is 
the third most common cause of cancer mortality 
worldwide.1 Chemotherapy with a platinum and fluoro­ 
pyrimidine is the recommended first­line therapy for 
patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro­ 
oesophageal junction cancer who have good performance 
status; patients who have human epidermal growth 
factor 2 (HER2)­positive tumours should also receive 
trastuzumab.2–6 In the second­line setting, treatment 
options include cytotoxic chemotherapy with docetaxel, 
paclitaxel, or irinotecan and the vascular endothelial 
(VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody 
growth 

ramucirumab given as either monotherapy or 
combination with paclitaxel. 



immune 
checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionised the treatment of 
advanced cancer. One such checkpoint is programmed 
death 1 (PD­1), which is a negative costimulatory receptor 
expressed mainly on activated T cells.7 In tumour cells, 
inhibition of PD­1 prevents PD­1 from binding to its 
ligands, PD­1 ligand 1 (PD­L1) and PD­1 ligand 2 (PD­L2), 
thus restoring antitumour immunity. Overexpression of 
PD­L1 has been observed in gastric cancer,8 making PD­1 
pathway inhibition a rational target in patients with 
gastric or gastro­oesophageal junction cancer.

Pembrolizumab is a humanised, high­affinity, IgG4­κ 
monoclonal antibody that binds to PD­1, preventing the 
interaction of PD­1 with PD­L1 and PD­L2. In the phase 
2 KEYNOTE­059 study,9 pembrolizumab had antitumour 
activity and a manageable safety profile in patients 
with previously treated gastric cancer who received 
pembrolizumab monotherapy at a fixed dose of 200 mg 
on day 1 of each 3­week cycle. Patients with advanced 
gastric cancer that progressed on two or more lines of 
previous therapy had a response rate of 11·6%; the 
response rate in patients with a PD­L1 combined positive 
score (CPS) of 1 or more was 15·5% in those who 
received pembrolizumab as third­line or later therapy 
and 22·7% in those who received pembrolizumab as 
third­line therapy. On the basis of the observed response 
rate and the durability of response, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval 
of pembrolizumab for the treatment of recurrent locally 
advanced or metastatic gastric or gastro­oesophageal 
junction adenocarcinoma that expresses PD­L1 (CPS ≥1) 
and progressed on or after two or more previous 
lines of therapy including platinum­containing and 
fluoro pyrimidine­containing chemotherapy and, 
if 
appropriate, HER2/neu­targeted therapy. 
Here we present results of the KEYNOTE­061 study of 
pembrolizumab compared with paclitaxel as second­line 
therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric or 
gastro­oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. 
Methods 
Study design and participants 
This randomised, open­label, phase 3 study was done at

Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed on Feb 10, 2018, with the terms “PD-1 OR 
PD-L1 OR MK-3475 OR pembrolizumab OR Keytruda OR 
BMS-936558 OR nivolumab OR Opdivo OR MPDL3280A OR 
atezolizumab OR Tecentriq OR MEDI4736 OR durvalumab OR 
Imfinzi OR MSB0010718C OR avelumab OR Bavencio” AND 
“gastric cancer OR gastroesophageal junction cancer.” No limits 
were applied to the search. We also searched the abstracts from 
the 2017 and 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology 
Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium, the 2016 and 2017 
American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting, the 
2016 and 2017 World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancer, and 
the 2016 and 2017 European Society for Medical Oncology 
Congress using the same terms to identify results of any clinical 
trials that were not yet published in the peer-reviewed scientific 
literature. We identified one randomised phase 3 trial of 
anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy for advanced gastric or gastro- 
oesophageal junction cancer, the ATTRACTION-2 study of 
nivolumab versus placebo as third-line or later therapy. We also 
identified phase 1 and phase 2 studies of anti-PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy for advanced gastric or gastro- 
oesophageal junction cancer (KEYNOTE-012 and KEYNOTE-059 
studies of pembrolizumab and the JAVELIN study of avelumab). 
In three additional phase 1 and phase 2 studies of anti-PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1 combination therapy, pembrolizumab was tested in 
combination with a platinum and fluoropyrimidine 
(KEYNOTE-059), ramucirumab (JVDF), or margetuximab, 
nivolumab was tested in combination with ipilimumab 
(CheckMate 032), and durvalumab was tested in combination 
with ramucirumab. We focused on the studies of anti-PD-1 or 
anti-PD-L1 monotherapy. 
Added value of this study 
This is the first report of data from a randomised trial of 
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy as second-line therapy for 
advanced gastric cancer and the first report of data from a 
randomised trial of anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy to include 
an active comparator. Although the prespecified boundary for 
detecting a statistically significant improvement in overall 
survival with pembrolizumab versus paclitaxel in patients with 
PD-L1-expressing tumours was not reached, the results of the 
protocol-specified exploratory subgroup analysis suggest that 
pembrolizumab might have antitumour activity in patients 
with a good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 
status. Data from post-hoc analyses suggest that 
pembrolizumab also has antitumour activity in patients whose 
tumours had higher levels of PD-L1 expression or high levels of 
microsatellite instability. The findings show that 
pembrolizumab has a favourable safety profile compared with 
paclitaxel, with patients treated with pembrolizumab having 
fewer adverse events attributed to study treatment that were 
high-grade or led to treatment discontinuation. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies appear to have antitumour 
activity in select patients with advanced gastric or gastro- 
oesophageal cancer, as well as a favourable safety profile. The 
greatest relative benefit for these therapies, when given as 
monotherapy, might be in the setting of third-line therapy and 
beyond in patients with a PD-L1 combined positive score of 1 or 
higher (approved by the US Food and Drug Administration) and 
as second-line therapy in patients with good performance 
status or patients whose tumours show high levels of 
microsatellite instability or higher levels of PD-L1 expression. 
These hypothesis-generating results suggest that prospective, 
controlled assessments of these subgroups are of value. Data 
from phase 1 and phase 2 studies suggest that combination 
regimens that include anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies are 
worthy of further assessment, particularly in early lines of 
therapy for advanced disease or earlier stages of disease.

South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, UK, and USA). An 
open­label design was chosen because the different 
pembrolizumab and paclitaxel administration schedules 
would make it difficult to do a masked study. Eligible 
patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically or 
cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach 
or gastro­oesophageal junction that was metastatic or 
locally advanced but unresectable, had progression as per 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 
(RECIST v1.1)10 after first­line therapy with a platinum 
and fluoropyrimidine, as well as with trastuzumab in 
patients with HER2­positive tumours, had an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
status of 0 or 1, and had provided a tumour sample for 
PD­L1 assessment. Initially, patients were enrolled 
irrespective of PD­L1 expression status. After 489 patients 
were enrolled, the independent data monitoring com­ 
mittee recommended that enrolment be restricted to 
patients with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher on the basis of 
outcomes in patients with a CPS less than 1. Exclusion 
included squamous­cell or un differentiated 
criteria 
histology, previous therapy with any PD­1, PD­L1, or 
PD­L2 inhibitor, and active autoimmune disease that 
necessitated systemic treatment. A complete list of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria is included in the 
appendix. 
The study protocol and all amendments were approved 
by the institutional review board or ethics committee at 
each institution. The study was done in accordance with 
the protocol and its amendments and Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines. All patients provided written 
informed consent before enrolment. 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) using a central 
interactive voice­response and integrated web­response 
system to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously 
every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m² intravenously on 
days 1, 8, and 15 of 4­week cycles. The allocation schedule 
was generated by the system vendor using a computerised 
random list generator. Enrolment of the first 125 patients 
was stratified by geographical region (Europe, Israel, 
North America, and Australia vs Asia vs rest of world) and 
ECOG performance status (0 vs 1). Following a protocol 
amendment, enrolment of the remaining 467 patients 
was stratified by geographical region (Europe, Israel, 
North America, and Australia vs Asia vs rest of the world), 
time to progression on first­line therapy (<6 months vs 
≥6 months), and PD­L1 CPS (<1 vs ≥1). The stratification 
factors were changed because time to progression on 
first­line therapy and PD­L1 expression status are 
predictive of response in second­line gastric cancer 
treatment and therefore might affect overall survival. 
Treatment was allocated in blocks of four in each stratum. 
Patients, treating doctors, the external data monitoring 
committee, and sponsor representatives were not masked 
to 
treatment assignment. The central radiological 
reviewers were masked to treatment assignment. 
Procedures 
Premedication with an oral corticosteroid, an anti­ 
histamine, cimetidine, and an antiemetic according to 
local guidelines was recommended in the paclitaxel 
group. Treatment was continued for 35 cycles (roughly 
2 years; pembrolizumab only) or until disease pro­ 
gression, intolerable toxicity, doctor decision, or patient 
withdrawal of consent. Patients with radiological disease 
progression who were clinically stable could continue 
study treatment until progression was confirmed on a 
scan obtained at least 4 weeks later. Patients who achieved 
confirmed complete response could discontinue treat­ 
ment if they received treatment for at least 24 weeks and 
received at least two doses of treatment beyond the time 
complete response was initially declared. Patients in the 
paclitaxel group were not permitted to cross over to 
receive pembrolizumab. 
Radiographic imaging was done every 6 weeks. 
Response was assessed per RECIST v1.110 by masked and 
independent central review. Adverse events were 
collected throughout treatment and for 30 days thereafter 
(90 days for serious adverse events and events of special 
interest to pembrolizumab) and graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events version 4.0. PD­L1 expression was 
assessed in archival or newly collected tumour samples 
at a central laboratory using the PD­L1 IHC 22C3 
pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies; Carpinteria, CA, 
USA) and measured using the CPS, defined as the 
number of PD­L1–positive cells (tumour cells, lympho­ 
cytes, macrophages) as a proportion of the total number 
of tumour cells multiplied by 100. DNA mismatch repair 
in five mononucleotide repeat markers (NR21, NR24, 
BAT25, BAT26, MONO27) was assessed using DNA 
extracted 
formalin­fixed, paraffin­embedded 
tumour samples and blood (normal control) using the 
MSI Analysis System version 1.2 (Promega; Madison, 
WI, USA). Tumours with high levels of microsatellite 
instability were those for which two or more markers 
were changed compared with normal controls. 

Outcomes 
Primary endpoints were overall survival, defined as 
the time from randomisation to death from any cause, 
and progression­free survival, defined as the time 
from randomisation to radiological disease progression 
(assessed per RECIST v1.1 by masked and independent 
central review) or death from any cause, in patients with 
a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
included: response rate, defined as the proportion of 
patients with complete or partial response, and duration 
of response, defined as the time from first documented

complete or partial response to radiological disease 
progression or death due to any cause (both assessed per 
RECIST v1.1 by masked and independent central review 
and by investigator assessment) in patients with a PD­L1 
CPS of 1 or higher and in the total population; 
progression­free survival (assessed per RECIST v1.1 by 
masked and independent central review) and overall 
survival in the total population; progression­free survival 
(assessed per RECIST v1.1 by investigator assessment 
and per irRECIST by masked and independent central 
review) in the population with CPS of 1 or higher and in 
the total population; and time to progression, defined as 
the time from randomisation to radiological disease 
progression (assessed per RECIST v1.1 by masked and 
independent central 
investigator 
assessment) in the population with CPS of 1 or higher 
and in the total population. Safety in all patients, 
irrespective of CPS, was also a secondary endpoint and 
was assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters, 
including adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs. 

Statistical analysis 
Overall survival, progression­free survival, and response 
rate were analysed in the intention­to­treat population, 
defined as all patients who were randomly allocated to 
treatment, irrespective of whether they received the 
treatment. Duration of response was analysed in all 
patients who had a best response of complete or partial 
response. Safety was assessed in all patients who received 
at least one dose of study treatment. 
The protocol specified one interim analysis and a final 
analysis. After reviewing the results of the interim 
analysis of overall survival, which was done by an 
unmasked statistician and was the primary analysis of 
progression­free survival, the external data monitoring 
committee recommended the study continue as planned. 
From inception, the study was designed to show a 
difference in overall survival or progression­free survival 
in patients with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher. The final 
analysis was planned for when at least 290 deaths 
occurred in patients with a CPS of 1 or higher or about 
15 months after the last patient was randomised, 
whichever occurred later. Assuming overall survival 
follows an exponential distribution with a median of 
7·5 months in the paclitaxel group (based on data from 
the RAINBOW trial11), an enrolment period of 14 months, 
a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·67 between pembrolizumab and 
paclitaxel, and an annual dropout rate of 2%, we calculated 
that 360 patients with a CPS of 1 or higher would have to 
be enrolled to provide 91% power to detect an HR of 0·67 
for overall survival at a one­sided α value of 0·0215. The 
Hwang­Shih­DeCani alpha­spending function with the 
gamma parameter of –4 was used to construct the actual 
boundaries at the final analysis on the basis of the actual 
α spent at the interim analysis and the number of events 
recorded at the interim and final analyses. The family­ 
wise type I error rate was strictly controlled at a one­sided 
α of 2·50%, with 0·35% allocated to the hypothesis of 
progression­free survival and 2·15% allocated to the 
hypothesis of overall survival (appendix); superiority of 
pembrolizumab was only required for one of the primary 
endpoints to conclude a significant treatment effect for 
pembroli zumab. With 326 deaths observed in the 
population of patients with PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher at 
the time of final analysis, the significance threshold for 
overall survival was p=0·0135 (one­sided). 
For overall survival, data for patients who were alive or 
lost to follow­up were censored at the time of last

confirmed contact. For progression­free survival, data for 
patients without disease progression or who were lost to 
follow­up were censored at the time of last tumour 
assessment. For duration of response, data for patients 
who were alive with ongoing response at the time of 
analysis or who discontinued the study without radio­ 
graphic evidence of progression were censored at the 
time of the last radiographic assessment showing 
response. For both progression­free survival and duration 
of response, data for patients who started new anticancer 
therapy without radiographic evidence of progression 
were censored at the time of the last tumour assessment 
before new anticancer therapy was initiated. 
SAS version 9.4 was used for all statistical analyses. 
Overall survival, progression­free survival, and duration 
of response were estimated using the Kaplan­Meier 
method. Treatment differences in overall and progression­ 
free survival were assessed using the log­rank test 
stratified by the randomisation stratification factors. 
HRs and their associated 95% CIs were calculated using 
stratified Cox proportional hazards models with Efron’s 
method of tie handling. In a post­hoc analysis designed to 
account for the non­proportional hazards effect associated 
with the overall survival curves for immunotherapy, the 
treatment difference in overall survival was assessed 
using the weighted log­rank test from the Fleming­ 
Harrington G(ρ–γ) family with ρ value of 1 and γ value 
of 1,12 such that events that occurred at middle timepoints 
were weighted more heavily than early and late events, 
with stratification by geographical region and time to 
progression on first­line therapy. The response rate was 
compared between treatment groups using the Miettinen 
and Nurminen method.

Results 
983 patients were screened for enrolment between 
June 4, 2015, and July 26, 2016. 593 patients met all 
eligibility criteria; one patient withdrew consent, and the 
remaining 592 patients were randomly assigned to 
pembrolizumab (n=296) or paclitaxel (n=296); at least one 
dose of treatment was received by 294 patients in the 
pembrolizumab group and 276 patients in the paclitaxel 
group (figure 1). 395 randomly allocated patients had a 
PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher (196 patients 
the 
pembrolizumab group and 199 patients in the paclitaxel 
group); of these, 194 patients in the pembrolizumab group 
and 188 patients in the paclitaxel received at least one dose 
of treatment. In the total population, 136 (46%) of

(47 [16%]), and ramucirumab (47 [16%]); 30 (10%) of 
296 patients received subsequent immunotherapy. 
As of Oct 26, 2017 (data cutoff date), median follow­up 
was 7·9 months (IQR 3·4–14·6) in the total population 
and 8·5 months (3·7–15·7) in the population with a 
PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher. No patients remained on 
paclitaxel, whereas 15 (5%) of 296 patients in the 
pembrolizumab group, including 13 (7%) of 196 patients 
with a CPS of 1 or higher, remained on pembrolizumab 
(figure 1). Additionally, eight (3%) of 296 patients in the 
treatment, 
pembrolizumab group completed study 
including seven (4%) of 196 patients with a PD­L1 CPS of 
1 or higher. 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics 
were as expected and were generally balanced between 
groups in the total population and the population with a 
PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher (table 1). Most patients were 
male, had gastric adenocarcinoma, had HER2­negative 
tumours, and had disease progression within 6 months 
of first­line therapy. 
At the time of data cutoff, 326 patients in the population 
with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher had died (151 [77%] of 
196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 175 [88%] of 
199 patients in the paclitaxel group). Pembrolizumab 
did not significantly prolong overall survival (HR 0·82, 
95% CI 0·66–1·03; one­sided p=0·0421). Median overall 
survival was 9·1 months 
(95% CI 6·2–10·7) for 
pembrolizumab and 8·3 months (95% CI 7·6–9·0) for 
paclitaxel (figure 2). The estimated proportion of patients 
surviving at 12 months was 40% (95% CI 33–47) with 
pembroli zumab and 27% 
(21–33) with paclitaxel; 
proportions at 18 months were 26% (95% CI 20–32) and 
15% (10–20), respectively. In a post­hoc analysis of the 
treatment difference in overall survival using the weighted 
log­rank test, the one­sided p­value was 0·0009. 


for pembrolizumab versus 
paclitaxel was mostly similar across subgroups of the 
population with PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher, with overlapping 
CIs in all subgroups (figure 2). Among these protocol­ 
specified subgroups, the pembrolizumab treatment effect 
was greater in patients with an ECOG performance status 
of 0 and in patients with a primary tumour in the gastro­

with an ECOG performance status of 0 was 12·3 months 
(95% CI 9·7–15·9) with pembrolizumab versus 
9·3 months (8·3–10·5) with paclitaxel (HR 0·69, 95% CI

(95% CI 5·3–8·4) with paclitaxel (HR 0·98, 95% CI 0·73– 
1·32; figure 3B). In post­hoc analysis, the pembrolizumab 
treatment effect was greater for patients with a PD­L1 CPS 
of 10 or higher (HR 0·64, 95% CI 0·41–1·02; median 
overall survival 10·4 months [95% CI 5·9–17·3] with

(HR 0·42, 95% CI 0·13–1·31; median overall survival not 
reached [95% CI 5·6 months–not reached] vs 8·1 months 
[2·0–16·7]; appendix). In the protocol­specified subgroup 
with a PD­L1 CPS less than 1, the HR was 1·20 (95% CI 
0·89–1·63), and median overall survival was 4·8 months 
(95% CI 3·9–6·1) with pembrolizumab versus 8·2 months 
(6·8–10·6) with paclitaxel (appendix). 
In the population with PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher, 
361 patients had disease progression or died, including 
177 (90%) of 196 patients in the pembrolizumab group and 
184 (94%) of 199 patients in the paclitaxel group. The HR 
for progression­free survival for pembrolizumab versus 
paclitaxel was 1·27 (95% CI 1·03–1·57; figure 4). Median 
progression­free survival was 1·5 months (95% CI 
1·4–2·0) for pembrolizumab and 4·1 months (3·1–4·2) 
for paclitaxel. The estimated proportion of patients alive 
and without disease progression at 12 months was 14% 
(95% CI 9–19) and 9% (5–14), respectively. The HR for 
progression­free 
the protocol­specified 
population with PD­L1 CPS less than 1 was 2·05 (95% CI 
1·50–2·79; appendix). 


In the population of patients with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or 
higher, confirmed responses were observed in 31 of 
196 patients in the pembrolizumab group (response rate 
16%, 95% CI 11–22) and in 27 of 199 patients in the 
paclitaxel group (response rate 14%, 95% CI 9–19); 
complete responses were observed in seven (4%) of 
196 patients in the pembroli zumab group and five (3%) of 
199 patients in the paclitaxel group. Responses were more 
durable in the pembroli zumab group than in the paclitaxel 
group, with a median response duration of 18·0 months 
(95% CI 8·3–not estimable) versus 5·2 months (3·2–15·3; 
appendix). Response rates in the subgroups with PD­L1 
CPS less than 1 and CPS of 10 or higher and in ECOG 
performance status subgroups of the population with a 
PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher are shown in the appendix. In a 
post­hoc analysis of patients whose tumours had high 
levels of microsatellite instability, irrespective of CPS, 
responses were observed in seven (47%) of 15 patients in 
the pembrolizumab group and in two (17%) of 12 patients 
in the paclitaxel group. 
Similar to the findings for progression­free and overall 
survival, pembrolizumab did not prolong time to 
progression compared with paclitaxel (appendix). As 
expected, the treatment effect for pembrolizumab for 
overall survival was less in the total population than in 
the population with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher; similarly,

pembrolizumab in the total population, the duration of 
response was the same as that observed in the population 
with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher (appendix). Outcomes 
for progression­free survival, time to progression, and 
response rate based on RECIST v1.1 by investigator 
assessment were generally similar to assessment by 
masked and independent central review (appendix). 
Of 570 patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment, irrespective of PD­L1 CPS, the mean treatment 
duration was 4·4 months (SD 6·1) in the 294 patients who 
received at least one dose of pembrolizumab and 
3·5 months (3·4) in the 276 patients who received at least 
one dose of paclitaxel. Adverse events attributed to study 
treatment by the investigator occurred in 155 (53%) of 
294 patients treated with pembrolizumab and 232 (84%) 
of 276 patients treated with paclitaxel (table 2). These 
events were of grade 3–5 severity in 42 (14%) of 294 patients 
in the pembrolizumab group and 96 (35%) of 276 patients 
in the paclitaxel group and led to discontinuation of study 
treatment in nine (3%) patients and 15 (5%) patients, 
respectively. Deaths attributed to study treatment occurred 
in three (1%) of 294 patients in the pembrolizumab group 
(colitis, interstitial lung disease, and death in one patient 
each) and in one (<1%) of 276 patients in the paclitaxel 
group (pulmonary embolism). 

Adverse event profiles were as expected for pembroli­ 
zumab and paclitaxel (table 2). The most common 
grade 3–5 adverse events attributed to study treatment 
were anaemia (seven [2%] of 294 patients) and fatigue 
(seven [2%]) in the pembrolizumab group and decreased 
neutrophil count 
[10%] of 276 patients) and 
neutropenia (20 [7%]) in the paclitaxel group. Adverse 
events of interest to pembrolizumab based on their likely 
immune aetiology, irrespective of attribution to study 
treatment, occurred in 54 (18%) of 294 patients treated 
with pembrolizumab and 21 (8%) of 276 patients treated 
with paclitaxel (table 2). The only adverse events of interest 
of grade 3–5 severity that occurred in two or more patients 
in the pembrolizumab group were hepatitis (four [1%] of 
294 patients), hypophysitis (two [<1%]), and pneumonitis 
(two [<1%]). 
Discussion 
In this randomised, open­label, phase 3 study, pembroli­ 
zumab did not significantly improve overall survival 
compared with paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric 
or gastro­oesophageal junction cancer with a PD­L1 CPS 
of 1 or higher that progressed after one line of chemo­ 
therapy containing a platinum and fluoropyrimidine. The 
overall survival curve for the pembrolizumab group 
appeared to plateau at about 20 months, supporting a 
long­term benefit for pembrolizumab in some patients. 
There was no improvement in progression­free survival 
or response rate; however, pembrolizumab responses 
were more durable than paclitaxel responses. The lack of a 
progression­free survival benefit with pembrolizumab is 
consistent with findings from other studies of second­line

the HRs for progression­free survival and time to 
progression in the total population were higher than

PD­1 inhibition in advanced cancers, including the 
KEYNOTE­045 
versus 
investigator’s choice of chemotherapy for previously 
treated advanced urothelial cancer. The safety profile of 
pembrolizumab was consistent with that previously 
observed for pembrolizumab in patients with advanced 
solid tumours and was better overall than that of paclitaxel, 
with a lower frequency of treatment­related adverse events 
of any grade, of grade 3 or worse severity, and that led to 
treatment discontinuation. 
The median overall survival in the paclitaxel group 
was generally consistent with that previously observed 
for paclitaxel given as second­line therapy for advanced 
gastric cancer.11,14 Although the combination of ramuci­ 
rumab and paclitaxel significantly improved overall 
survival compared with paclitaxel alone in the second­ 
line advanced gastric cancer setting11 and is currently 
the global standard­of­care second­line therapy for 
patients with advanced gastric cancer and a good 
performance status, this was not the case when 
KEYNOTE­061 was designed in late 2014. We therefore 
chose paclitaxel monotherapy for our control group. We 
acknowledge that future studies of second­line therapy 
should use ramucirumab plus paclitaxel combination 
therapy as the comparator. 
Protocol­specified subgroup analysis in the primary 
population of patients with a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher 
showed that patients with an ECOG performance status 
of 0 had a greater relative treatment effect with 
pembrolizumab compared with patients who had a 
performance status of 1, as did patients with a primary 
tumour location of the gastro­oesophageal junction 
compared with the stomach. Better ECOG performance 
status was also associated with a higher response rate 
and longer overall survival with pembrolizumab in 
KEYNOTE­059.9 The prognostic effect of performance 
status in KEYNOTE­061 appeared to be more pronounced 
in the pembrolizumab group than in the paclitaxel group. 
Further analysis is necessary to determine why the 
prognostic effect differs between treatment groups. 
Combination therapy with pembrolizumab and cytotoxic 
chemotherapy could help overcome the delayed response 
of pembrolizumab and the less durable responses of 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. Data from a small phase 1 cohort 
of KEYNOTE­059 suggest that pembro lizumab combined 
with cisplatin and 5­fluorouracil or capecitabine has a 
manageable safety profile and promising antitumour 
activity in patients with previously untreated advanced 
gastric or gastro­oesophageal cancer.15 In the ongoing 
phase 3 KEYNOTE­062 study (NCT02494583), the efficacy 
and safety of this combination is being compared with 
those of cisplatin and 5­fluorouracil or capecitabine and 
those of pembrolizumab monotherapy in patients with 
previously untreated advanced gastric or gastro­ 
oesophageal cancer. 
Consistent with results of KEYNOTE­0599 and study 
findings for pembrolizumab in other tumour types,16–18 
a relationship between greater PD­L1 expression and a 
greater treatment effect for pembrolizumab was found in 
KEYNOTE­061. These data reinforce the utility of PD­L1 
expression for selecting patients for treatment with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy. Of note, data from the 
Asian ATTRACTION­2 study, in which the anti­PD­1 
mono clonal antibody nivolumab was compared with 
placebo in patients with advanced gastric cancer whose 
disease progressed after two or more previous chemo­ 
therapy regimens, showed a significant benefit for 
nivolumab in all patients, including those with PD­L1­ 
negative 
in 
ATTRACTION­2 was assessed retrospectively on tumour 
cells using the 28­8 pharmDx assay, with PD­L1 expression 
available for only 39% of patients. In KEYNOTE­061, 
PD­L1 expression was prospectively assessed on tumour 
cells and tumour­associated lymphocytes and macro­ 
phages using the 22C3 pharmDx assay, which might be a 
better predictor of outcomes 
tumour PD­L1 
expression alone. 


Defects in mismatch repair result in tumours that have 
an increased number of somatic mutations, which could 
induce an innate antitumour immune response and 
render tumours more responsive to immune checkpoint 
blockade.20 On the basis of data from phase 1 and phase 2 
studies,21–23 in which levels of microsatellite instability were 
assessed locally using PCR or immuno histochemistry, 
pembrolizumab was approved in the USA for the 
treatment of patients with previously treated advanced 
solid tumours of any type that have a high level of 
microsatellite instability. In a post­hoc exploratory analysis 
of this study, patients whose tumours had high levels of 
microsatellite instability (as assessed retrospectively at a 
central laboratory by PCR and irrespective of PD­L1 CPS) 
had a particularly large treatment effect with pembroli­ 
zumab. These findings confirm the use of mismatch 
repair deficiency and microsatellite instability as predictive 
for pembrolizumab. Analyses of other 
biomarkers 
biomarkers that might predict response to pembrolizumab, 
including the presence of Epstein­Barr virus RNA,8,24 are 
ongoing. 
Examination of the Kaplan­Meier curve for overall 
survival in the primary population of patients with a 
PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher showed that for about the first 
8 months after randomisation, the paclitaxel group 
outperformed the pembrolizumab group. At 8 months, 
the survival curves crossed. After this divergence, the 
separation in favour of pembrolizumab was sustained, 
probably because of the greater durability of benefit 
in those patients who had response or prolonged stable 
disease. The crossing of survival curves has been 
observed in studies of PD­1 and PD­L1 inhibitors in other 
tumour types13,25–27 and might reflect the time it takes to 
induce an effective antitumour immune response. The 
delayed onset of benefit for immunotherapy and the 
the proportional hazards assumption 
violation of 
highlight the need for alternative statistical methods to 




accurately assess 
therapies.28 
the benefit of 
One alternative is to use the weighted log­rank test. A 
post­hoc analysis of the treatment difference between 
pembrolizumab and paclitaxel using the weighted log­ 
rank test, such that more weight was placed on the events 
that occurred around the middle of the follow­up 
duration (ie, around the time at which the overall survival 
curves crossed) and less weight on events that occurred 
early or late, resulted in a one­sided p­value of 0·0009. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published 
report of findings from a global, randomised, active­ 
controlled trial of an immune checkpoint inhibitor in 
advanced gastric cancer. The other published report of a 
randomised study of a checkpoint inhibitor for advanced 
gastric cancer was the aforementioned ATTRACTION­2 
study of nivolumab versus placebo in patients from 
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan whose disease progressed 
after two or more prior chemotherapy regimens.19 
A limitation of this study is the open­label design, 
which led to the larger number of patients who were 
randomised but did not receive study treatment in the 
paclitaxel group than in the pembrolizumab group. These 
patients probably went on to receive other therapies, 
which could have affected the results in the paclitaxel 
group and thus the relative benefit of pembrolizumab 
versus paclitaxel. Although 
treatment groups 
appeared well balanced, the exclusion of patients with a 
PD­L1 CPS less than 1 after 83% of patients were enrolled 
and the change in stratification factors after 21% of 
patients were enrolled might have introduced bias that 
affected the results. 

Our data show that pembrolizumab monotherapy did 
not significantly improve overall survival compared with 
paclitaxel in patients with advanced gastric cancer with 
a PD­L1 CPS of 1 or higher that progressed on first­ 
line chemotherapy containing a platinum and fluoro­ 
pyrimidine. However, a benefit from pembrolizumab 
long­term follow­up, with clinically 
emerged with 
meaningful 12­month and 18­month survival estimates 
of about 40% and 26%, respectively. Protocol­specified 
and post­hoc exploratory subgroup analyses suggest that 
the treatment effect of pembrolizumab might be more 
pronounced in patients with a better performance status, 
greater levels of PD­L1 expression, and tumours with 
high levels of microsatellite instability. Along with the 
favourable safety profile, these data support further 
exploration to identify patients who are likely to benefit 
from pembrolizumab monotherapy and the ongoing 
development of pembrolizumab as part of combination 
therapy regimens.
