Summary 
Background Microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer is typically unresponsive to immunotherapy. This phase 3 
study was designed to assess atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in metastatic colorectal cancer. Here, we report the 
comparison of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab monotherapy versus regorafenib in the third-line setting. 
Methods IMblaze 370 is a multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial, done at 73 academic medical 
centres and community oncology practices in 11 countries. Patients aged at least 18 years with unresectable locally 
advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, 
and disease progression on or intolerance to at least two previous systemic chemotherapy regimens were enrolled. 
We used permuted-block randomisation (block size four) to assign patients (2:1:1) via an interactive voice and web 
response system to atezolizumab (840 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) plus cobimetinib (60 mg orally once daily for 
days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle), atezolizumab monotherapy (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks), or regorafenib 
(160 mg orally once daily for days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle). Stratification factors were extended RAS status (wild-type vs 
mutant) and time since diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs ≥18 months). Recruitment of patients with high 
microsatellite instability was capped at 5%. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat 
population. Safety was assessed in the population of patients who received at least one dose of their assigned 
treatment. IMblaze370 is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788279. 
Findings Between July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 363 patients were enrolled (183 patients in the atezolizumab plus 
cobimetinib group, 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 90 in the regorafenib group). At data cutoff (March 9, 2018), 
median follow-up was 7·3 months (IQR 3·7–13·6). Median overall survival was 8·87 months (95% CI 7·00–10·61) 
with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 7·10 months (6·05–10·05) with atezolizumab, and 8·51 months (6·41–10·71) 
with regorafenib; the hazard ratio was 1·00 (95% CI 0·73–1·38; p=0·99) for the combination versus regorafenib and 
1·19 (0·83–1·71; p=0·34) for atezolizumab versus regorafenib. Grade 3–4 adverse events were reported in 109 (61%) 
of 179 patients in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 28 (31%) of 90 in the atezolizumab group, and 46 (58%) 
of 80 in the regorafenib group. The most common all-cause grade 3–4 adverse events in the combination group were 
diarrhoea (20 [11%] of 179), anaemia (ten [6%]), increased blood creatine phosphokinase (12 [7%]), and fatigue 
(eight [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 71 (40%) of 179 patients in the combination group, 15 (17%) of 
90 in the atezolizumab group, and 18 (23%) of 80 in the regorafenib group. Two treatment-related deaths occurred in 
the combination group (sepsis) and one in the regorafenib group (intestinal perforation). 
Interpretation IMblaze370 did not meet its primary endpoint of improved overall survival with atezolizumab plus 
cobimetinib or atezolizumab versus regorafenib. The safety of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib was consistent with 
those of the individual drugs. These results underscore the challenge of expanding the benefit of immunotherapy to 
patients whose tumours have lower baseline levels of immune inflammation, such as those with microsatellite-stable 
metastatic colorectal cancer. 


Introduction 
Metastatic colorectal cancer is associated with a poor 
prognosis and low 5-year overall survival (5–8%).1 The 
standard of care for patients with chemorefractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer in the third-line setting and 
beyond is regorafenib (a small-molecule multikinase 
inhibitor) or TAS-102 (a cytotoxic combination of tri- 
fluridine and tipiracil).2 Patients with chemorefractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib 
have a median progression-free survival of 1·9 months

(IQR 1·6–3·9) and median overall survival of 6·4 months 
(3·6–11·8), with an objective response achieved by only 
about 1% of patients.3 Patients treated with TAS-102 have 
a median progression-free survival of 2·0 months 
(95% CI 1·9–2·1) and median overall survival of 
7·1 months (6·5–7·8), with an objective response 
achieved by only 1·6% of patients.2,4 Accordingly, these 
drugs have a small survival benefit and substantial 
potential toxicity issues,1,3–6 demonstrating the remaining 
unmet need for more efficacious treatment options for 
most patients with chemorefractory metastatic colorectal 
cancer. 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the program- 
med cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and programmed cell 
death-1 (PD-1) pathway have shown durable responses 
and disease control in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer with high microsatellite instability, a population 
that constitutes 3–5% of patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer.7–11 By contrast, immune checkpoint inhibitors have 
little clinical benefit in patients with microsatellite-stable 
tumour types,7 a population that comprises most patients 
with metastatic colorectal cancer. Although most 
microsatellite-stable tumours do not have T-cell infiltration 
and are considered immune excluded, the mechanism 
underlying immune resistance in such tumours remains 
poorly understood. Preclinical data have suggested that 
MAPK signalling might affect mechanisms of immune 
escape, including down regulation of major histocom- 
patibility complex class 1 expression and upregulation of 
multiple immuno suppressive cytokines and cell surface 
molecules.12–14 Preclinical models have also shown that 
MAPK pathway inhibition with MEK inhibitors might 
increase T-cell infiltration into tumours and augment the 
anti-tumour activity of PD-1 inhibitors by increasing 
MHC-1 and PD-L1 expression.12,13 Cobimetinib is a MEK1 
and MEK2 inhibitor that blocks the MAP kinase pathway, 
which is integral in cell cycle regulation and affects the 
immune contexture in the tumour microenvironment. 
Cobi metinib has been shown 
in colorectal cancer 
preclinical models to increase major histocompatibility 
complex class 1 expression on tumours, increase effector 
CD8+ cell infiltration into tumours, downregulate multiple 
immunosuppressive cytokines and receptors, and lead to 
durable anti-tumour immunity when combined with a 
PD-L1 inhibitor.13 MEK inhibitors have been previously 
assessed in the treatment of meta static colorectal cancer; 
however, cobimetinib mono therapy produced no response 
in 41 patients with colorectal cancer, 28 of whom had a 
KRAS mutation.15 
Atezolizumab is a humanised IgG1 monoclonal anti- 
body that selectively targets PD-L1 and blocks its 
interactions with PD-1 and B7.1 protein receptors, thereby 
reinvigorating the antitumour T-cell response.16–18 In a 
phase 1b clinical trial of 23 patients,19 the drug com- 
bination of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib resulted in 
17% of patients achieving an objective response. Results 
from an expanded update after initiation of our phase 3 
trial showed the combination to be tolerable, with an 
objective response in 8% of patients, median overall 
survival of 10·0 months (95% CI 6·2–14·1), and 46% of 
patients were alive at 12 months,20 which compares 
favourably to the results with regorafenib.3 Additionally, 
partial responses were achieved by patients with both 
KRAS mutations and wild-type tumours.20 




Evidence before this study 
We searched PubMed and international congress presentations 
pertaining to studies on metastatic colorectal cancer before 
study initiation and then again during manuscript preparation. 
We searched with medical subject heading search terms 
”metastatic” AND ”colon cancer”, ”colorectal carcinoma”, 
”programmed cell death 1”, ”PD-1”, ”programmed cell death 
ligand 1”, or ”PD-L1” for articles published between June 1, 2011, 
and June 1, 2016, in English. We found that despite 
improvements in treatment, the prognosis for heavily 
pretreated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer remains 
poor, with a median overall survival of about 6 months. 
Additionally, therapies are associated with substantial toxicity. 
Therefore, more efficacious and tolerable treatments are needed 
for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 
Added value of this study 
The IMblaze370 trial tested innovative and important 
hypotheses in the field of metastatic colorectal cancer and 
cancer immunotherapy. Although not superior to standard of 
care, treatment with the combination of atezolizumab and 
cobimetinib resulted in equivalent survival without the 
introduction of any new safety signals compared with the 
safety profile of the individual drugs. These results contribute to 
our ongoing understanding of metastatic colorectal cancer and 
cancer immunotherapy. Despite the importance of both the 
MEK and PD-L1 pathways in metastatic colorectal cancer 
pathogenesis, dual inhibition of the PD-L1 immune checkpoint 
and MAPK-mediated immune suppression did not improve 
overall survival in patients with difficult-to-treat 
chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer compared with 
the standard of care drug, regorafenib. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
These results from IMblaze370 highlight the biological 
differences between metastatic colorectal cancer that is 
microsatellite stable and that which has high microsatellite 
instability, underscoring the divergent treatment needs of 
patients with these two disease types. Although atezolizumab 
plus cobimetinib will not be a treatment option for 
microsatellite-stable patients, given the activity of these drugs, 
they will continue to be explored in patients with other tumour 
types as well as in different treatment combinations. 

Preclinical results, supported by early-phase studies, 
provided an impetus to assess the combination of 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib in a phase 3 trial 
(IMblaze370) 
predominantly 
microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer who 
had progressed or were intolerant of 5-fluoropyrimidine, 
oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Here, we report the efficacy 
and safety results from 
the primary analysis of 
IMblaze370. 

Methods 
Study design and participants 
We did this multicentre, open-label, phase 3, randomised, 
controlled trial at 73 academic medical centres and 
community oncology practices in 11 countries (appendix 
pp 3–4). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic colorectal 
cancer, with a baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group perfor mance status of 0–1, a life expectancy of at 
least 3 months, adequate haematological and end organ 
function, and disease progression or intolerance of at 
least two previous systemic chemotherapy regimens 
(containing fluoro uracil, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) in 
the metastatic setting. Patients who had received previous 
anti angiogenic or anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) therapy were eligible; however, those who had 
received previous treatment with any cancer immuno- 
therapy (including CD137 agonists, anti-PD-L1, anti- 
PD-1, or anti-CTLA4 agents), MEK or ERK inhibitors, or 
regorafenib were excluded. Patients who had received 
major surgery or radiotherapy within 21 days before the 
start of treatment were excluded, as were those who had 
received treatment with any anticancer drug within 
14 days before treatment initiation. Enrolment of patients 
with tumours with high microsatellite instability was 
capped at about 5%. Enrolment of patients with RAS 
wild-type tumours was capped at 50%. Comorbidities 
that were not permitted include active malignancy (other 
than colorectal cancer), active or untreated CNS meta- 
stases, uncontrolled infections, history of clinically sig- 
nificant cardiovascular disease, evidence or risk of retinal 
vein occlusion or central serous retinopathy, and auto- 
immune disease. Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are 
in the protocol (appendix pp 47–50). 
The study protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board or independent ethics committee of each 
study site and was done in accordance with the Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice and Declaration of Helsinki. 
All patients gave written informed consent. 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1) to receive 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib (group A), atezolizumab 
monotherapy (group B), or regorafenib (group C) via an 
interactive voice and web response system. A permuted- 
block randomisation (block size of four) was applied to 
obtain balanced assignment in each treatment group 
with respect to the stratification factors: extended RAS 
mutation status (wild-type vs mutant) and time since 
diagnosis of first metastasis (<18 months vs ≥18 months). 
The trial centres enrolled the patients. The study was 
open label and investigators and participants were not 
masked to treatment allocation. 
Procedures 
Atezolizumab was given intravenously at 840 mg every 
2 weeks to patients in group A and at 1200 mg every 
3 weeks to patients in group B. Atezolizumab dose 
modification was not permitted. Cobimetinib 60 mg 
(group A) or regorafenib 160 mg (group C) was given 
orally once daily on days 1–21 of a 28-day cycle. 
Atezolizumab, cobimetinib, and regorafenib were 
provided by the funder. Cobimetinib dose modification 
was permitted and dose reduction for adverse events 
was allowed in 20 mg increments (appendix p 109). 
Regorafenib was also prescribed through pharmacy as 
standard of care and dose modifications were allowed on 
the basis of local prescribing guidelines. Treatment was 
continued until loss of clinical benefit, as assessed by the 
investigator, or unacceptable toxicity. Because this patient 
population has few treatment options, patients could 
continue treatment despite radiographic progression, 
as approved by the funder, as long as requirements 
regarding patient safety were met. No crossover was 
allowed per protocol. Disease progression will be 
established on the basis of investigator assessment with 
use of RECIST, version 1.1. Efficacy outcomes were 
assessed in prespecified patient sub groups defined by 
centrally confirmed extended RAS mutation and 
microsatellite instability status, as well as key baseline 
clinical characteristics. 
All tumour assessments were done according to 
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST), 
version 1.1. Baseline assessments were done within 
35 days before cycle 1 day 1, whereas on-treatment 
response assessments were done every 8 weeks (or 
within 1 week either side of this timepoint) until 
investigator-established progressive disease, 
loss of 
clinical benefit, withdrawal of consent, or death, 
whichever occurred first. Patients who discontinued 
treatment for any reason other than disease progression 
had additional tumour assessments every 8 weeks (or 
within 1 week either side of this timepoint) until disease 
progression. Patients in all groups who continued study 
treatment beyond disease progression (defined per 
RECIST version 1.1) had additional tumour assessments 
every 8 weeks (or within 1 week either side of this 
timepoint). The National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, 
was used to characterise the toxicity profile, including 
the incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events. 
Extended RAS mutation and micro satellite instability 
status were established by next-generation sequencing 
with the FMOne test (Foundation Medicines Inc; 



Cambridge, MA, USA). Microsatellite instability status 
was established by examination of indel characteristics at 
114 homopolymer repeat loci in or near the targeted gene 
regions of the FMOne gene panel. The 114 loci were 
selected from a set of 1897 microsatellites that have 
the best coverage. PD-L1 protein expression levels in 
infiltrating immune cells were established by immuno- 
histochemistry (Ventana SP142 assay; Tucson, AZ, USA). 
Tumour samples were archival tissues from primary or 
metastatic lesions collected less than 5 years previously. 
Outcomes 
The primary endpoint was overall survival with 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib versus regorafenib and 
overall survival with atezolizumab monotherapy versus 
regorafenib. The key secondary efficacy endpoints were 
investigator-assessed objective response, duration of 
response, and progression-free survival per RECIST, 
version 1.1, with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib versus 
regorafenib and with atezolizumab monotherapy versus 
regorafenib. Other secondary endpoints were impact on 
functioning and health-related quality of life, assessed 
by the European Organization for Research and Treat- 
ment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 question naire, 
and are not reported here. Overall survival was defined 
as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. 
Progression-free survival was defined as the time from 
randomisation to documented disease progression or 
death, whichever occurred first. Objective response was 
defined as the proportion of patients who had a 
confirmed objective response of complete or partial 
response, assessed by the investigator. Duration of 
response was measured in all patients who had an 
objective response during the study and was defined as 
the time from the first occurrence of a complete or 
partial response (whichever is recorded first) until the 
first date of documented disease progression or death. 
Pharmacokinetic exploratory biomarker studies and 
patient-reported outcome assessments were also done 
but are not presented here.

Statistical analysis 
IMblaze370 was designed to have 87% power to detect an 
overall survival hazard ratio (HR) of 0·61 (an increase in 
the median overall survival from 6·4 to 10·5 months) in 
favour of atezolizumab plus cobimetinib (group A) 
versus regorafenib (group C), and 80% power to detect 
an overall survival HR of 0·61 in favour of atezolizumab 
monotherapy (group B) versus regorafenib (group C), 
both with a two-sided type I error rate of 0·05 controlled 
by a hierarchical statistical testing procedure (testing 
if 
atezolizumab monotherapy vs regorafenib only 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib vs regorafenib was 
positive). These HRs represent clinically meaningful 
differences that were potentially achievable based on the 
phase 1b study results.19 The overall survival final analysis 
was triggered when there were about 235 deaths across 
all three groups (specifically, around 178 deaths for the 
comparison of group A vs group C and around 127 deaths 
for the comparison of group B vs group C). No interim 
overall survival analyses were planned. 




confirmed 
progression-free survival and duration of response were 
analysed using the stratified log-rank test. HRs for overall 
survival and progression-free survival were estimated 
using a stratified Cox regression model. The Kaplan- 
Meier method was used to estimate median survival and 
duration of response, whereas the Brookmeyer-Crowley 
method was used to calculate 95% CIs for the medians. 
The objective response and corresponding 95% CIs 
for each treatment group were calculated using the 
Clopper-Pearson method. The efficacy analysis of overall 
survival, progression-free survival, and objective res- 
ponse was done in all enrolled patients (intention-to-treat 
[ITT] population). Duration of response was assessed in 
patients who achieved an objective response. Safety, 
including summary of adverse events, was assessed in all 
enrolled patients who received at least one dose of study 
treatment (safety population). 
Statistical analyses were done using SAS, version 9.4.

appendix (p 128).

Results 
Between July 27, 2016, and Jan 19, 2017, 484 patients were 
screened, of whom 121 were excluded because they 
did not meet inclusion criteria; 363 patients were 
enrolled (figure 1). 183 patients were randomly assigned 
to receive atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 90 to receive 
atezolizumab monotherapy, and 90 to receive regorafenib. 
349 patients received at least one dose of their assigned 
treatment and were included in the safety population 
(179 in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 90 in 
the atezolizumab group, and 80 in the regorafenib group. 
Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics were 
well balanced between study groups (table 1). Numbers 
of patients with microsatellite-stable or microsatellite- 
low disease versus those with high microsatellite 
instability were 170 (93%) of 183 versus three (2%) of 
183 
in the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group, 
83 (92%) of 90 versus three (3%) of 90 in the atezolizumab 
monotherapy group, and 80 (89%) of 90 versus none 
in the regorafenib group. The prevalence of patients 
with RAS-mutant tumours was balanced across the 
three groups. At least 86% of patients in all three groups 
had received previous anti-EGFR or anti-VEGF treatment. 
Similar proportions of patients received subsequent 
systemic therapies across the three groups, with about 
25% of all patients receiving at least one subsequent 
treatment after study treatment, and eight (2%) of all 
363 patients receiving anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 in later 
lines (appendix p 11). 
At data cutoff (March 9, 2018; median follow-up 
7·3 months [IQR 3·7–13·6]), 14 months after the last 
patient was enrolled, 247 patients had died (event-to- 
patient ratio of 68%); 125 (68%) in the atezolizumab 
plus cobimetinib group, 65 (72%) in the atezolizumab 
group, and 57 (63%) in the regorafenib group. The study 
did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival, 
since overall survival did not differ significantly between 
any of the treatment groups. Median overall survival was 
8·87 months (95% CI 7·00–10·61) with atezolizumab 
plus cobimetinib, 7·10 months (6·05–10·05) with atezo- 
lizumab, and 8·51 months (6·41–10·71) with regorafenib 
(figure 2A), with a stratified HR of 1·00 (95% CI 
0·73–1·38; p=0·99) for atezolizumab plus cobimetinib 
versus regorafenib and 1·19 (0·83–1·71; p=0·34 [p value 
for descriptive purposes only]) 
for atezolizumab 
monotherapy versus regorafenib (figure 2A). Overall 
survival in the ITT population was 64·7% (57·6–71·8) 
at 6 months and 38·5% (31·2–45·8) at 12 months with 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 61·3% (50·9–71·6) and 
27·2% (17·6–37·8) with atezolizumab, and 63·5% 
(53·0–73·9) and 36·6% (26·2–47·0) with regorafenib. 

Median progression-free survival was 1·91 months 
(95% CI 1·87–1·97) 
the combination group, 
1·94 months (1·91–2·10) in the atezolizumab group, and 
2·00 months (1·87–3·61) in the regorafenib group 
(figure 2B). Similar proportions of patients in the 
three treatment groups achieved an objective response;

no complete responses were recorded in any of the 
groups (table 2). Duration of response was also similar 
between the groups. 
Post-hoc exploratory analyses were done to compare 
survival between the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib 
group and the atezolizumab group. Both median 
progression-free survival and median overall survival 
were similar in both groups (figure 2). 125 (68%) of 
183 patients died and 111 (61%) had progression in the 
combination group, whereas 65 (72%) of 90 patients died 
and 61 (68%) had progresion in the atezolizumab 
monotherapy group (table 2). 

Subgroup analyses of overall and progression-free 
survival showed similar results to the primary analyses 
(figure 3; appendix pp 5–10). Subgroup analyses of 
secondary efficacy endpoints showed similar proportions 
of patients with RAS-mutated tumours achieving an 
objective response between 
treatment groups 
(table 2). Partial responses were achieved by two (67%) of 
three patients with high microsatellite instability in the 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group (duration of 
response 9·1 months for one patient and 11·8 months 
for the other) and by one (33%) of three patients with 
in the atezolizumab 
high microsatellite 
monotherapy group (duration of response 5·8 months). 
In a post-hoc subgroup analysis of patients with high 
PD-L1 expression, the proportion of patients achieving 
an objective response in this subgroup was higher in 
both atezolizumab-containing groups than in the control 
regorafenib monotherapy group (table 2). 

Patients had a median treatment duration of 59·0 days 
(IQR 42·0–112·0) for cobimetinib and 1·9 months 
(1·4–3·7) for atezolizumab in the combination group, 
1·4 months (1·0–3·5) for atezolizumab in the mono- 
therapy group, and 51·5 days (42·5–161·5) for rego- 
rafenib. Key safety outcomes and reasons for treatment 
discontinuation are in the appendix (pp 12–13). 
All-cause adverse events were reported in 178 (99%) of 
179 patients who received atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, 
83 (92%) of 90 who received atezolizumab, and 78 (98%) 
of 80 treated with regorafenib (table 3); grade 3–4 adverse 
events were reported in 109 (61%) patients, 28 (31%) 
patients, and 46 (58%) patients in the three groups, 
respectively. The most common all-cause grade 3–4 
adverse events in the combination group were diarrhoea 
(20 [11%] of 179), anaemia (ten [6%]), increased blood 
creatine phosphokinase (12 [7%]), and fatigue (eight [4%]). 
Serious adverse events were reported in 71 (40%) of 
179 patients in the combination group, 15 (17%) of 90 in 
the atezolizumab group, and 18 (23%) of 80 in the 
regorafenib group (appendix pp 14–16). Incidence, grade, 
and nature of adverse events of special interest are 
in appendix (pp 17–18). 37 (21%) of 179 patients discon- 
tinued atezolizumab plus cobimetinib, four (4%) of 
90 discontinued atezolizumab monotherapy, and seven 
(9%) of 80 discontinued regorafenib because of adverse 
events (appendix pp 12–13). Five (3%) of 179 patients 
treated with atezolizumab plus cobimetinib had adverse 
events resulting in death, including two treatment- 
related sepsis events (table 3), whereas two (3%) of 
80 patients had adverse events resulting in death in the 
regorafenib group, one of which was treatment related 
(intestinal perforation). No fatal adverse events occurred 
in the atezolizumab monotherapy group. 
Discussion 
The IMblaze370 phase 3 study did not meet its primary 
endpoint of improvement in overall survival with 
atezolizumab plus cobimetinib or atezolizumab mono- 
therapy versus regorafenib. The combination also did not 
improve overall survival compared with regorafenib or 
atezolizumab alone. Secondary endpoints of progression- 
free survival, objective response, and duration of 
response also showed no significant difference across all 
three groups. Regorafenib, which was chosen as the 
standard of care because it is approved globally for all 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have 
previously received fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, 
an anti-VEGF therapy, and—if the patient has wildtype 
RAS status—an anti-EGFR therapy. Notably, in this 
randomised trial, patients in the regorafenib group 
survived 
the protocol assumption of 
than 
6·4 months, based on the CORRECT study.3 

Although many patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer who have tumours with high microsatellite 
instability benefit from clinical improvement after 
immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, patients with 
microsatellite-stable tumours do not. This difference in 
drug sensitivity might be attributed to the unique 
microenvironments of these tumour types. Tumours 
with high microsatellite instability exhibit a more active

immune microenvironment than microsatellite-stable 
tumours because of neoantigens arising from the 
hypermutated state of the tumour cells.7,21–23 By contrast, 
microsatellite-stable tumours have little to no response to 
immunotherapy, in part because of reduced expression 
of checkpoint proteins, including PD-L1, which provide a 
target for cancer immunotherapy.21,24 In patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer being treated in the third- 
line setting, where overall survival is less than 6 months, 
combination treatment might be a strategy to overcome 
this treatment resistance regardless of microsatellite 
instability status.

metastatic colorectal cancer with high microsatellite 
instability in both a monotherapy and combination 
setting with ipilimumab, but not in microsatellite-stable 
cohorts, including those with high PD-L1 expression.7,8,25,26 
In a pivotal phase 2 study,7 the importance of mismatch 
repair status for prediction of clinical benefit from 
immune checkpoint blockade with pembrolizumab was 
reported. In patients with colorectal cancer without 
mismatch repair, 40% achieved an objective response 
and 78% were alive without disease progression at 
20 weeks compared with those with proficient mismatch 
repair, of whom none achieved an objective response and 
11% achieved progression-free survival at 20 weeks.7 
Results from the CheckMate-142 study26 reported that 
55% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with 
high microsatellite instability who were treated with the 
combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab achieved 
an objective response.26 By contrast, 4% of patients 
with PD-L1-positive metastatic colorectal cancer had an 
objective response (one of 23 patients, and that patient 
had high microsatellite instability), with a median 
progression-free survival of 1·8 months (95% CI 1·4–1·9) 
and median overall survival of 5·3 months (2·2–11·0).27 
Because of the better efficacy seen in patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer with high microsatellite 
instability and absence of efficacy seen in PD-L1-positive 
patients, the IMblaze370 study capped patients with high 
microsatellite instability at 5%, which is the prevalence 
in this patient population, and did not enrich enrolment 
for PD-L1-positive patients. 
Beneficial immunomodulatory effects due to MEK 
inhibition have been shown in models of colorectal cancer, 
melanoma, and breast cancer. In preclinical models, MEK 
inhibitors combined with anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA4 anti- 
bodies provide additional activity over each individual 
drug.12,28 In mouse models, treatment with cobimetinib 
impedes tumour growth while promoting the effector 
phenotype and longevity of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ 
T cells. Treatment with the combination of a MEK inhi- 
bitor and anti-PD-L1 drug resulted in synergistic inhibition 
of tumour growth, including durable responses and, in 
some instances, complete regression.13 A phase 1b–2 study 
was initiated to assess the combination of cobimetinib 
and atezo lizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer and had 
pro mising results,19,20 and thus this phase 3 trial was 
initiated. 
Despite hypotheses supported by preclinical and 
clinical data, in IMblaze370 we did not observe clinically 
meaningful differences in progression-free survival and 
overall survival in patients with microsatellite-stable 
metastatic colorectal cancer by clinical or biomarker 
subgroup between the three treatment groups, including 
patients with extended RAS mutation or high PD-L1 
expression. The immunomodulatory effects of the 
addition of a MEK inhibitor to an anti-PD-L1 might have 
not been adequate to overcome the immune resistance 
in microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal cancer, 
a tumour type known for its non-inflamed, non- 
immunogenic phenotype. Although too few patients 
with high microsatellite instability were included to draw 
firm conclusions, some clinical activity with the com- 
bination treatment was observed in this subgroup. 
Responses to atezolizumab monotherapy seem to be 
consistent with published data for other PD-L1 or PD-1 
inhibitors in microsatellite-stable disease.7,25,26 Safety in 
the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib group was consistent 
with the known safety profiles of the individual drugs, 
with no new signals reported. 
Metastatic colorectal cancer has a heterogenous 
genomic landscape, characterised by multiple genetic 
alterations and diverse molecular phenotypes. Patients 
having third-line treatment are those in whom multiple 
therapeutic regimens have failed or become non-viable 
because of intolerance. 
Despite the rationale supported by preclinical data, our 
results suggest that dual inhibition of the PD-L1 immune 
checkpoint and MAPK-mediated immune suppression is 
insufficient to generate antitumour immune responses 
in immune-excluded tumours, such as microsatellite- 
stable metastatic colorectal cancer. This failure to generate 
a response could be because of alternative mechanisms to 
bypass the inhibition of the MAPK pathway by a MEK 
inhibitor in microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal 
cancer. The combination of a selective BRAF inhibitor 
(dabrafenib) and a selective MEK inhibitor (trametinib) 
did not result in the same extent of MAPK signalling 
inhibition 
in tumour samples from patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer with BRAFV⁶⁰⁰ mutations as 
it did for patients with this same mutation in melanoma.29 
Overall, the limitations of the IMblaze370 trial were as 
follows: this study was not designed to assess the 
combination in different biomarker subsets, which might 
have been more sensitive to this combination; and the 
study population of patients with chemorefractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer is a very difficult-to-treat 
population. 
The overall safety of the atezolizumab plus cobimetinib 
combination is consistent with the toxicity profile of the 
two single drugs, and no unexpected new safety signals 
or increased frequency of the known safety signals of the 
single drugs were detected. The two drugs have very 
distinct adverse event profiles, and overlapping adverse 
events such as diarrhoea or colitis do not seem to be 
increased in frequency or severity by the combination. 
The atezolizumab plus cobimetinib combination did 
have more treatment-related adverse events, including 
grade 3 or worse and serious adverse events, than 
atezolizumab monotherapy, but were consistent with 
those seen with the vemurafenib plus cobimetinib 
combination in BRAF-mutant melanoma, the setting in 
which cobimetinib is approved.30 
Overall, in this trial, no improvement was observed in 
patients with microsatellite-stable metastatic colorectal 
cancer receiving atezolizumab plus cobimetinib over 



those treated with regorafenib. These results highlight 
the strong biological differences between microsatellite- 
stable tumours and those with high microsatellite 
instability, underscoring the divergent treatment needs 
between these two disease types. Other immunotherapy 
combinations are worth exploring in patients with 
metastatic colorectal cancer, despite the negative results 
of the IMblaze370 study, because a high unmet need 
remains for patients with chemorefractory metastatic 
colorectal cancer and the potential of immunotherapy 
has not been demonstrated with single drugs.
