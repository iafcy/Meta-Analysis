Summary 
Background Atezolizumab (a monoclonal antibody against PD-L1), which restores anticancer immunity, improved 
overall survival in patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer and also showed clinical benefit when 
combined with chemotherapy as first-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. IMpower130 aimed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line therapy for non- 
squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. 
Methods IMpower130 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study done in 131 centres across eight countries 
(the USA, Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Israel). Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, and 
had histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, an Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and received no previous chemotherapy for stage IV disease. Patients 
were randomly assigned (2:1; permuted block [block size of six] with an interactive voice or web response system) to 
receive atezolizumab (1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) plus chemotherapy (carboplatin [area under the curve 
6 mg/mL per min every 3 weeks] plus nab-paclitaxel [100 mg/m² intravenously every week]) or chemotherapy alone for 
four or six 21-day cycles followed by maintenance therapy. Stratification factors were sex, baseline liver metastases, and 
PD-L1 tumour expression. Co-primary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall 
survival in the intention-to-treat wild-type (ie, EGFRwt and ALKwt) population. The safety population included patients 
who received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02367781. 
Findings Between April 16, 2015, and Feb 13, 2017, 724 patients were randomly assigned and 723 were included in 
the intention-to-treat population (one patient died before randomisation, but was assigned to a treatment group; this 
patient was excluded from the intention-to-treat population) of the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group 
(483 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 451 patients in the intention-to-treat wild-type population) or 
the chemotherapy group (240 patients in the intention-to-treat population and 228 patients in the intention-to-treat 
wild-type population). Median follow-up in the intention-to-treat wild-type population was similar between groups 
(18·5 months [IQR 15·2–23·6] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 19·2 months [15·4–23·0] in the 
chemotherapy group). In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, there were significant improvements in median 
overall survival (18·6 months [95% CI 16·0–21·2] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 13·9 months 
[12·0–18·7] in the chemotherapy group; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·79 [95% CI 0·64–0·98]; p=0·033) and median 
progression-free survival (7·0 months [95% CI 6·2–7·3] in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 
5·5 months [4·4–5·9] in the chemotherapy group; stratified HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·54–0·77]; p<0·0001]). The most 
common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (152 [32%] of 473 in the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group vs 65 [28%] of 232 in the chemotherapy group), anaemia (138 [29%] vs 47 [20%]), and 
decreased neutrophil count (57 [12%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events were reported in 112 (24%) 
of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 30 (13%) of 232 patients in the chemotherapy 
group. Treatment-related (any treatment) deaths occurred in eight (2%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and one (<1%) of 232 patients in the chemotherapy group. 
Interpretation IMpower130 showed a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival and a 
significant improvement in progression-free survival with atezolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as 
first-line treatment of patients with stage IV non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and no ALK or EGFR 
mutations. No new safety signals were identified. This study supports the benefit of atezolizumab, in combination 
with platinum-based chemotherapy, as first-line treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.

Introduction 
the 
Platinum-based combination chemotherapy 
historical first-line standard of care for patients with 
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, no actionable 
mutations, and good performance status.1,2 For patients 
with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer and no 
history of haemoptysis, platinum-based chemotherapy in 
combination with bevacizumab is another option.1,2 In 
cases of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with 
sensitising mutations in EGFR or ALK alterations, 
European Society for Medical Oncology and National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend 
treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the first 
instance.1,2 Novel approaches to non-small-cell lung 
cancer treatment include the introduction of immuno- 
therapies, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies.1,2 
Despite the available treatments, overall survival 
remains low for patients with advanced non-small-cell 
lung cancer. Atezolizumab is an engineered, humanised 
monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody that inhibits binding 
of PD-L1 to PD-1 and B7.1 (also known as CD80), 
thus restoring anticancer 
immunity.3–7 Efficacy of 
atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with previously 
treated advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer 

in the second-line (or beyond) setting was investigated 
in the phase 2 POPLAR trial (NCT01903993)8 and 
phase 3 OAK trial (NCT02008227).9 Results from both 
trials showed improvements in overall survival with 
atezolizumab versus docetaxel, with median overall 
survival of 12·6 months (95% CI 9·7–16·4) versus 
9·7 months (8·6–12·0) in the POPLAR trial8 and 
13·8 months (11·8–15·7) versus 9·6 months (8·6–11·2) 
in 
trial.9 Subgroup analyses suggested 
improvements in overall survival regardless of PD-L1 
status.8–10 On the basis of these data, atezolizumab 
monotherapy was approved for the treatment of patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung 
cancer who were previously treated with chemotherapy.6,7 
Combining atezolizumab with chemotherapy might 
be synergistic: chemotherapy might elicit anticancer 
immunity through release of potentially immuno- 
genic tumour antigens.11,12 Nab-paclitaxel is a nano- 
particle albumin-bound form of paclitaxel that does 
not require steroid premedication, which has poten- 
tially immuno suppressive effects.13 The combination of 
carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel is therefore an inter- 
esting chemotherapy combination to be studied with 
atezolizumab. 






Evidence before this study 
We searched for articles and abstracts relevant to non-small-cell 
lung cancer and cancer immunotherapy using PubMed and 
various congress proceedings, including the American Society 
of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, the International 
Association for the Study of Lung Cancer World Conference on 
Lung Cancer, and the European Society for Medical Oncology 
annual meeting. We used the search terms “non-squamous 
NSCLC”, “NSCLC”, “atezolizumab”, “pembrolizumab”, 
“nivolumab”, “anti-PD-L1”, and “cancer immunotherapy” 
(full names and abbreviations), and relevant articles published 
from database inception to Oct 31, 2014, were selected 
(including clinical, non-clinical, and non-English publications). 
Platinum-based combination chemotherapy regimens remain 
the standard of care for first-line treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer and 
no actionable mutations. The scientific literature searches 
confirmed that, despite progress with new targeted 
treatments—eg, for sensitising mutations in EGFR or ALK 
alterations, and alternative chemotherapy combinations— 
overall survival for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer was low 
and that acquired resistance to targeted agents was a major 
clinical problem. Therefore, alternative treatment options that 
yielded durable responses and enhanced overall survival were 
an important focus of research. Against this background, 
immunotherapeutic agents, such as antibodies that modulate 
immune cell activity, offered an alternative treatment approach 
that could potentially improve the prognosis of patients with 
this disease. 
Added value of this study 
Anti-PD-1 monotherapy is becoming established as a standard 
of care for patients with PD-L1-high, and EGFR-negative and 
ALK-negative tumours. The majority of patients in IMpower130 
have PD-L1-low, PD-L1-negative, or PD-L1-unknown disease, 
and for these patients, conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy is 
still required in combination with immunotherapy. The results 
from IMpower130 suggest that atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy is an additional first-line treatment option to be 
considered when formulating treatment plans for patients with 
advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. 
Implications of all the available evidence 
The findings from IMpower130 suggest that addition of 
atezolizumab to platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line 
treatment of non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer 
significantly improves overall survival compared with 
platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Results from a recent 
phase 3 trial have demonstrated the clinical benefit of adding a 
PD-1 inhibitor to pemetrexed and platinum-based therapy in 
first-line non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. 
We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin plus nab- 
paclitaxel) versus chemotherapy alone as first-line 
therapy for patients with stage IV non-squamous non- 
small-cell lung cancer who have not previously received 
chemotherapy. 
Methods 
Study design and participants 
IMpower130 was a multicentre, randomised, open-label, 
phase 3 study done in 131 academic medical centres and 
community oncology practices in North America (Canada 
and the USA), western Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, 
Italy, and Spain), and Israel (appendix pp 25–28). 
Patients were aged 18 years or older, and had 
histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV non- 
squamous non-small-cell 
lung cancer, an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 
or 1, and received no previous chemotherapy for stage IV 
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with 
a sensitising mutation in the EGFR gene or ALK fusion 
oncogene must have had disease progression (during or 
after treatment) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1, or intolerance to 
treatment with at least one tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(discontinued >7 days before randomisation). Patients 
with unknown EGFR or ALK status were required to 
have had locally or centrally assessed testing at screening. 
Patients were required to have known PD-L1 tumour 
status, determined by centrally assessed immuno- 
histochemistry either on archival tumour tissue or tissue 
obtained at screening. Patients with treated asymptomatic 
CNS metastases were also eligible, but those with active 
or untreated CNS metastases, spinal cord compression, 
or 
leptomeningeal disease were ineligible. Eligible 
patients were required to have adequate haematological 
and end-organ function, which was defined as an 
absolute neutrophil count of 1500 cells per μL or more 
without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support; a 
lymphocyte count of 500 cells per μL or more; a platelet 
count of 100 000 per μL or more without transfusion; 
haemoglobin concentration of 9·0 g/dL or more (patients 
could be transfused to meet this criterion); international 
normalised ratio or activated partial thromboplastin time 
of 1·5 × upper limit of normal (ULN) or less (only applied 
to patients who were not receiving therapeutic anti- 
coagulation; patients receiving therapeutic anticoagu- 
lation should have been on a stable dose); aspartate 
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline 
phosphatase 2·5 × ULN or less (with the following 
exceptions: aspartate aminotransferase or alanine amino- 
transferase ≤5 × ULN in patients with documented liver 
metastases; alkaline phosphatase ≤5 × ULN in patients 
with docu mented liver or bone metastases); serum 
bilirubin 1·25 × ULN or less (patients with known Gilbert 
disease who had serum bilirubin level ≤3 × ULN could be 
enrolled); and serum creatinine 1·5 × ULN or less. 
Previous neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, or chemo radio therapy with curative intent 
for non-metastatic disease were permitted if patients had 
a treatment-free interval of 6 months or more from 
randomisation. 
Patients were ineligible if they had autoimmune 
disease. Patients with malignancies other than non- 
small-cell 
lung cancer within the 5 years before 
randomisation were excluded, as were patients with a 
history of interstitial lung disease (including idio- 
pathic pulmonary fibrosis, organising pneumonia, drug- 
induced pneumonitis, 
idiopathic pneumonitis, or 
evidence of active pneumonitis at screening). Previous 
treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint 
blockade therapies, anti-PD-1 therapeutic antibodies, and 
anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies was not permitted (see 
appendix pp 135–42 for the complete list of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria). See the appendix for the study 
protocol. 



the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
E6 Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration 
of Helsinki, and the ICH E2A guideline for expedited 
clinical safety data reporting. Each site was required to 
submit written documentation of protocol approval by 
the local ethics committee or institutional review board 
before initiating the study. All patients provided written 
informed consent. 
Randomisation and masking 
Patients were randomly assigned with permuted block 
randomisation (block size of six) and an interactive voice 
or web response system (IxRS; Bracket; San Francisco, 
CA, USA). Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to 
receive atezolizumab plus chemotherapy or chemo- 
therapy alone, and stratification factors were sex (male 
vs female), presence of liver metastases at baseline 
(yes vs no), and PD-L1 tumour expression by immuno- 
histochemistry (tumour cells TC3 and any tumour- 
infiltrating immune cells [IC] vs TC0/1/2 and IC2/3 vs 
TC0/1/2 and IC0/1). 
Procedures 
Patients received induction atezolizumab treatment 
(1200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks) in combination 
with chemotherapy comprising carboplatin (area under 
the curve 6 mg/mL per min every 3 weeks) plus nab- 
paclitaxel (100 mg/m² intravenously every week) or 
chemotherapy alone according to the same schedule for 
four or six 21-day cycles. The number of induction 
treatment cycles (four or six) was at the discretion of the 
investigator and determined or documented before 
randomisation. Following induction, patients in the 
atezolizumab plus chemo therapy group 
received 
maintenance treatment with 1200 mg intra venous 
atezolizumab and patients in the chemotherapy group 
received best supportive care or pemetrexed switch 



maintenance therapy, at the investigator’s discretion. In 
the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group, maintenance 
therapy was administered until investigator-assessed loss 
of clinical benefit or toxicity, and in the chemotherapy 
group pemetrexed maintenance was administered until 
disease progression, as per RECIST (version 1.1), or 
toxicity. Atezolizumab dose reductions were not allowed; 
patients could temporarily suspend study treatment with 
atezolizumab for up to 105 days beyond the last dose if 
they had an adverse event that required a dose to be 
withheld. If a patient was tapered off steroids used to 
treat adverse events, atezolizumab could be withheld 
beyond 105 days from the last dose until steroids were 
discontinued or reduced to prednisone dose (or dose 
equivalent) 10 mg or less per day. The acceptable length 
of interruption was dependent on agreement between 
the investigator and the study’s medical monitor. Nab- 
paclitaxel and carboplatin doses could be reduced or 
withheld for specific toxicities according to the protocol 
(appendix). 
Crossover to receive atezolizumab at disease progression 
was permitted only for patients in the chemotherapy 
group enrolled before June 15, 2016 (versions 1–4 of the 
protocol), providing that they continued to meet eligibility 
criteria. The option for patients in the chemotherapy 
group to receive atezolizumab under the auspices of the 
protocol after failure of first-line study treatment was 
removed to minimise confounding of the co-primary 
overall survival endpoint that was added to protocol in 
version 5 (June 15, 2016). 
Permitted concomitant therapies included cortico- 
steroid treatment (≤10 mg oral prednisone or equivalent) 
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and low-dose 
corticosteroids for patients with orthostatic hypotension 
or adrenocortical insufficiency. 
Patients underwent tumour assessments at baseline 
and a CT scan (contrast enhanced unless contraindicated) 
or MRI of the thorax and abdomen every 6 weeks (± 7 days) 
for the first 48 weeks following cycle 1, day 1, regardless of 
dose delays; after 48 weeks, tumour assess ment was 
required every 9 weeks (± 7 days). Patients had tumour 
assessments until radiographic disease progression as per 
RECIST, version 1.1 (or loss of clinical benefit in patients 
receiving atezolizumab who continued atezolizumab after 
radiographic disease progression), withdrawal of consent, 
study termination by sponsor, or death; whichever 
occurred first. Patients who discontinued treatment for 
reasons other than radiographic disease progression 
continued scheduled tumour assessments until radio- 
graphic disease progression (or loss of clinical benefit for 
patients receiving atezolizumab who had continued 
atezolizumab after radiographic disease progression), 
withdrawal of consent, study termination by sponsor, or 
death; whichever occurred first, regardless of whether 
patients had started a new anticancer therapy. Patients in 
all treatment groups had a mandatory tumour biopsy 
sample collection, unless not clinically feasible, at the 
first evidence of radiographic disease progression. An 
independent review facility did a blinded radiology review 
of the imaging data, and tumour response and progression 
were independently assessed as a sensitivity analysis. 
Haematology and serum chemistry tests were done at 
screening, during the induction phase, during the 
maintenance phase, and at the treatment discontinuation 
visit. Coagulation tests were done at screening and at the 
treatment discontinuation visit. 
All adverse events were assessed at baseline, during the 
induction period, during the maintenance phase, at the 
treatment discontinuation visit, and during survival 
follow-up. Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse 
events were graded in accordance with National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, version 4.0. 
PD-L1 expression was centrally assessed by immuno- 
histochemistry with the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) Assay 
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA), which is 
optimised to detect PD-L1 on tumour cells and tumour- 
infiltrating immune cells.7 PD-L1 expression was assessed 
by scoring the percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour 
cells (TC0: <1% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1; 
TC1: ≥1% and <5% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1; 
TC2: ≥5% and <50% of tumour cells expressing 
PD-L1; TC3: ≥50% of tumour cells expressing PD-L1) and 
on tumour-infiltrating immune cells, by scoring immune 
cells expressing PD-L1 as a percentage of tumour area 
(IC0: <1% of immune cells expressing PD-L1; IC1: ≥1% 
and <5% of immune cells expressing PD-L1; IC2: ≥5% and 
<10% of immune cells expressing PD-L1; IC3: ≥10% of 
immune cells expressing PD-L1). PD-L1 assays were 
stored and processed centrally by Targos Molecular 
Pathology GmBH (Kassel, Germany). 
Outcomes 
The reported co-primary endpoints were investigator- 
assessed progression-free survival and overall survival 
in randomised patients with EGFRwt or ALKwt tumours 
(ie, the wild-type population). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included investigator- 
assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in 
the intention-to-treat population; investigator-assessed 
progression-free survival and overall survival according to 
PD-L1 expression in the intention-to-treat wild-type and 
intention-to-treat populations; objective response and 
duration of response in the intention-to-treat wild-type 
population; 1-year and 2-year overall survival (to be 
reported separately at a later date); time to deterioration 
in patient-reported lung cancer symptoms, as determined 
by European Organisation for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer scales; and change from baseline in patient- 
reported lung cancer symptoms as determined by 
Symptoms in Lung Cancer scales (to be reported 
separately at a later date). 





Statistical analysis 
The sample size was based on the number of events 
required to demonstrate efficacy for both progression- 
free survival and overall survival (co-primary endpoints). 
We aimed to randomise about 715 patients, and about 
650 patients were expected to be in the intention-to-treat 
wild-type population. 
To control the overall type I error rate for the two-sided 
test at 0·05, we allocated a two-sided α of 0·006 to 
progression-free survival and a two-sided α of 0·044 
to overall survival. We tested the primary comparison of 
progression-free survival at a two-sided α level of 0·006 
in the intention-to-treat wild-type population. We tested 
the primary comparison of overall survival in the 
intention-to-treat wild-type population at the allocated α, 
together with the α recycled from the progression-free 
survival analysis 
the progression-free survival 
if 
comparison was significant (appendix p 3).14 
One interim analysis was planned for the co-primary 
endpoint of overall survival. The final progression-free 
survival analysis and the interim overall survival analysis 
were planned when about 352 overall survival events 
were observed in intention-to-treat wild-type population. 
We calculated the stopping boundaries for overall 
survival analyses using the LanDeMets approximation to 
the Pocock boundary (the actual stopping boundary for 
the interim overall survival analysis was calculated to 
be 0·0425). If overall survival in the intention-to- 
treat wild-type population was significant, progression- 
free survival and overall survival were to be formally 
tested in the intention-to-treat population following the 
same α-spending algorithm and allocation ratio (3:22) in 
the intention-to-treat wild-type population. An overview 
of the analysis populations is detailed in the appendix 
(p 2). We compared progression-free survival and overall 
survival between treatment groups using a stratified log- 
rank test; we estimated the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI 
for progression-free survival and overall survival for 
treatment comparisons using a stratified Cox regres- 
sion model. We used Kaplan-Meier methodology to 
estimate the median progression-free survival and 
median overall survival for each treatment group. We 
used Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology to estimate the 
95% CI for the median progression-free survival and the 
median overall survival for each treatment group.15 
We calculated an estimate of overall response and its 
95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method for each 
treatment group. We determined CIs for the difference in 
overall response between the two groups using the normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution. We compared 
the overall response between the two groups using the 
stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. We estimated 
the duration of response using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
The safety population included all treated patients, 
defined as randomised patients who had received any 
protocol treatment. Patients were grouped according to 
whether any full or partial dose of atezolizumab was 
received, including when atezolizumab was received in 
error. 
An independent data monitoring committee evaluated 
and reviewed unblinded safety data on a periodic basis, 
approximately every 6 months from the first patient 
enrolled. The sponsor was blinded to the efficacy results 
until the final analysis of progression-free survival. 






Role of the funding source 
The study sponsor was involved in the study design, 
protocol development, regulatory and ethics approvals, 
safety monitoring and reporting, and data collection, 
analysis, and interpretation. The employees of the 
sponsor collected, managed, and analysed data, had 
access to the raw data, and were involved in the writing of 
the report. All authors had full access to all study data 
and interpreted and analysed the data. The corresponding 
author had full access to all of the data in the study and 
had final responsibility for the decision to submit for 
publication. 
Results 
Between April 16, 2015, and Feb 13, 2017, 1247 patients 
were assessed for eligibility, with 523 ineligible for 
enrolment (figure 1). 
724 patients were randomly assigned and 723 were 
included in the intention-to-treat population (one patient 
died before randomisation, but was assigned to a 
treatment group; this patient was excluded from the 
intention-to-treat population). The 
intention-to-treat 
population comprised 483 patients in the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group and 240 patients in the 
chemotherapy group. The intention-to-treat wild-type 
population comprised 451 patients in the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group and 228 patients in the 
chemotherapy group. The safety population included 
473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and 232 patients in the chemo therapy group. 
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced 
between treatment groups, including in the PD-L1 
diagnostic subgroups (table 1). Of note, use of corti- 
costeroids (including all use, irrespective of reason) was 
similar in both groups (359 [80%] of 451 patients in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 181 [79%] of 
228 in the chemotherapy group). 

In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, the 
median 
similar between groups 
(18·5 months [IQR 15·2–23·6] in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and 19·2 months [15·4–23·0] in the 
chemotherapy group). At data cutoff (on March 15, 2018), 
347 (77%) of 451 patients in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and 198 (87%) of 228 patients in the 
chemotherapy group had a progression-free survival 



Figure 1: Trial profile 
*One patient died before randomisation, but was assigned to a treatment group; this patient was excluded from 
the intention-to-treat population. †Eight patients were discontinued from the study: five patients were randomly 
assigned in error (no study drugs administered), one patient moved to another facility, one patient died before 
drug administration, and one patient had a long hospital stay before the first dose of study drug. ‡Four patients 
were randomly assigned in error and were discontinued from the study (no study drug administered). §Includes

event. Median 
investigator-assessed progression-free 
survival was 7·0 months (95% CI 6·2–7·3) in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 5·5 months 
(4·4–5·9) in the chemotherapy group (stratified HR 0·64 
[95% CI 0·54–0·77]; p<0·0001]; figure 2A). 226 (50%) of 
451 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and 131 (57%) of 228 patients in the chemotherapy 
group had died. Median overall survival was 18·6 months 
the atezolizumab plus 
(95% CI 
chemotherapy group and 13·9 months (12·0–18·7) in the 


chemotherapy group (stratified HR 0·79 
[95% CI 
0·64–0·98]; p=0·033; figure 2B). Analyses of progression- 
free survival assessed by an independent review facility 
were similar to the primary analysis (appendix p 4). 
In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, 176 (39%) 
of 451 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and 151 (66%) of 228 patients in the chemotherapy 
group received cancer therapy of any category after 
disease progression (appendix p 5). In the chemotherapy 
group, 135 (59%) of 228 patients received immunotherapy 
after disease progression, including atezolizumab at 
crossover as per the protocol (93 [41%] of 228 patients in 
the chemotherapy group). In the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group, 33 (7%) of 451 patients received 
further treatment with immunotherapy agents. 
As the primary analysis of overall survival crossed the 
prespecified boundary, progression-free survival and 
overall survival could be formally tested in the intention- 
to-treat population, according the same α-spending 
allocation and algorithm per the co-primary analyses. In 
the intention-to-treat population, median follow-up was 
similar between groups (18·5 months [IQR 15·2–23·6] 
in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 
18·8 months [15·3–23·3] in the chemotherapy group). 
Median investigator-assessed progression-free survival 
and median overall survival are shown in figure 3. 
Subgroup analyses showed consistent overall survival 
(figure 4) and progression-free survival (figure 5) benefit 
with atezolizumab across the majority of clinical 
subgroups, except for patients with liver metastases, in 
whom atezolizumab plus chemotherapy did not show 
improved overall survival versus chemotherapy alone, 
and for patients with EGFR or ALK genomic alterations 
(appendix p 6). With respect to the PD-L1 subgroups, 
treatment benefit was observed in terms of overall 
survival and progression-free survival in the intention- 
to-treat and intention-to-treat wild-type populations, 
regardless of PD-L1 expression (appendix p 7). 

In the intention-to-treat wild-type population, the 
proportion of patients (who had measurable disease at 
baseline) with a confirmed objective response was higher 
chemo therapy group 
in 
(220 [49·2%, 95% CI 44·5–54·0] of 447 patients) than in 
the chemotherapy group (72 [31·9%, 25·8–38·4] of 
226 patients; odds ratio 2·07 [95% CI 1·48–2·89]; 
appendix p 8). More patients in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group compared with the chemotherapy 
group had a complete response (11 [2%] of 447 vs 
three [1%] of 226) or a partial response (209 [47%] of 
447 vs 69 [31%] of 226; appendix p 8). More patients in the 
chemotherapy group, compared with the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group, had stable disease (86 [38] of 
226 vs 136 [30%] of 447) or progressive disease (41 [18%] of 
226 vs 49 [11%] of 447; appendix p 8). Treatment with 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy resulted in improved 
confirmed duration of response compared with chemo- 
therapy alone (appendix pp 8–9). Among responders, the

At the time of the analysis, 473 patients in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 232 patients 
in the chemotherapy group received at least one cycle of 
treatment (appendix p 10). Mean treatment duration 
in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group was 
8·9 months (SD 7·2) for atezolizumab, 2·8 months (1·3) 
for nab-paclitaxel, and 2·4 months (1·2) for carboplatin. 
In the chemotherapy group, mean treatment duration 
was 2·6 months (SD 1·3) for nab-paclitaxel, 2·2 months 
(1·2) for carboplatin, and 4·9 months 
(4·1) for 
pemetrexed. Mean number of doses in the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group was 12·8 (SD 9·8) for

atezolizumab, 82·6% (13·5) for nab-paclitaxel, and 
90·2% (10·2) for carboplatin (appendix p 10). In the 
chemotherapy group, mean dose intensities were 84·2% 
(SD 13·8) for nab-paclitaxel, 91·3% (9·4) for carboplatin, 
and 96·7% (5·6) for pemetrexed (appendix p 10). The 
exposure to carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel was therefore 
similar in both treatment groups.

of 232 patients in the chemotherapy group (table 2; 
appendix p 11). 
The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related 
adverse events were neutropenia (152 [32%] of 473 in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 65 [28%] of 
232 in the chemotherapy group), anaemia (138 [29%] vs 
47 [20%]), and decreased neutrophil count (57 [12%] vs 
19 [8%]; table 2). Fatal adverse events (of any causality) 
were reported in 25 (5%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group and 13 (6%) of 232 patients in 
the chemotherapy group (appendix p 19). Of note, the 
proportion of patients with adverse events leading to death 
related to infection or sepsis was similar in both treatment 
groups (eight [2%] of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and five [2%] of 232 patients in the 
chemotherapy group). Deaths related to any treatment 
component according to the investigator occurred in 
eight (2%) of 473 patients treated with atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy and one (<1%) of 232 patients treated with 
chemotherapy (table 2; appendix p 11). Further details are 
provided in the appendix (p 2). 
Serious adverse events were observed in 240 (51%) of 
473 patients in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group versus 88 (38%) of 232 patients in the chemo- 
therapy group (appendix p 11 and p 20). Serious adverse 
events that were reported with a difference of 2% or more 
between the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and 
chemotherapy groups were lung infection (14 [3%] of 
473 patients vs one [<1%] of 232 patients), neutropenia 
(14 [3%] vs two [1%]), and diarrhoea (14 [3%] vs two [1%]; 
appendix p 20). Treatment-related serious adverse events 
were reported in 112 (24%) of 473 patients in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 30 (13%) of 
232 patients in the chemotherapy group (appendix p 11 
and p 21). 
The proportion of patients with adverse events leading 
to discontinuation of any study treatment was 125 (26%) 
of 473 in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group 
compared with 51 (22%) of 232 patients in the chemo- 
therapy group (appendix p 11 and p 22). The most 
common adverse events leading to discontinuation 
were 
fatigue 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and 
(appendix p 22). No adverse events leading to withdrawal 
of any study treatment were reported with a 2% or more 
difference between the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy 
group and the chemotherapy group. 
The proportion of patients experiencing adverse events 
leading to dose modification or interruption of any study 
treatment was 402 (85%) of 473 patients in the 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group versus 186 (80%) 
of 232 patients in the chemotherapy group (appendix p 11 
and p 23). Adverse events leading to dose modification or 
interruption that were reported with difference of 2% or 
more in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group 
versus chemotherapy group were neutropenia (182 [38%] 
of 473 patients vs 83 [36%] of 232 patients), anaemia 
(77 [16%] vs 31 [13%]), decreased platelet count (71 [15%] vs 
26 [11%]), pyrexia (23 [5%] vs three [1%]), diarrhoea 






























































































Data are n (%). Safety data are included for the chemotherapy group for patients up until crossover. Adverse events with an incidence of ≥10% in any group or grade 3–4 
severity with incidence of ≥5% in any group are shown. All grade 3–5 events are listed in appendix pp 12–18. The causes of treatment-related deaths in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group were reported as pneumonitis (n=2), death (n=1), septic shock (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), cardiac arrest (n=1), ventricular tachycardia (n=1), 
and hepatic cirrhosis (n=1). The cause of the treatment-related death in the chemotherapy group was sepsis (n=1). *Neutrophil count decreased and neutropenia represent

vs one [<1%]), and asthenia (ten [2%] vs 11 [5%]; 
appendix p 23). 
Immune-related adverse events were reported in 
213 (45%) of 473 patients in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group and the majority were grade 1–2 in 
severity (appendix p 24). The most common immune- 
mediated adverse events reported were rash in 114 (24%) 
patients, hypothyroidism in 70 (15%) patients, and 
hepatitis (includes adverse events of autoimmune 
hepatitis, hepatic failure, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular 
injury as well as adverse events of 
liver-related 
abnormal investigations [laboratory]) in 46 (10%) patients 
(appendix p 24). 
Discussion 
This phase 3, randomised IMpower130 study met its 
co-primary endpoints of demonstrating a significant and 
clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival 
and a significant improvement in progression-free 
survival in patients treated with atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone as a 
first-line treatment in patients with stage IV non- 
squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. In the intention- 
to-treat wild-type population, progression-free survival at 
the 12-month 
twice as high with 
atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemo- 
therapy alone. Additionally, since overall survival crossed 
the prespecified boundary for significance, the secondary 
endpoints of overall survival and progression-free 
survival in the intention-to-treat population were formally 
tested, and these endpoints were also significantly 
different between groups. 


The magnitude of overall survival benefit in reduction 
of the risk of death and median improvement of 
4·7 months is clinically meaningful as well as significant. 
is robust, as the findings for the 
This outcome 
chemotherapy group are in line with historical controls. 
The overall survival advantage was observed, despite 
crossover to at least one subsequent line of immuno- 
therapy by almost 60% of patients in the chemo therapy 
group. Patients 
the chemotherapy group were 
also permitted to receive maintenance therapy with 
pemetrexed, where appropriate, 
to reflect modern 
standards of care. The difference in magnitude of the 
median point estimates observed between overall survival 
and progression-free survival has been observed in other 
studies of checkpoint inhibitors in non-small-cell lung 
cancer, and overall survival might be a more sensitive 
endpoint for cancer immunotherapy in non-small-cell 
lung cancer than progression-free survival.9,16–18 The open- 
label nature of the study might have affected the treating 
physician’s 
the assessment of disease 
progression in the chemotherapy group, because the 
earlier versions of the protocol allowed patients in 
the chemotherapy group who had disease progression to 

cross over to receive atezolizumab as a second-line 
treatment. Analysis of the blinded, independent review of 
progression-free survival was, however, consistent with 
progression-free survival according to the investi gators’ 
assessment, so knowledge of treatment assign ment was 
unlikely to have confounded the progression-free survival 
endpoint. 
Although IMpower130 was not powered to detect a 
significant difference within subgroups, overall survival 
and progression-free survival benefit was observed across 
PD-L1 diagnostic subgroups irrespective of the level of 
PD-L1 expression. In the case of progression-free survival, 
there was a stepwise treatment effect according to PD-L1 
expression; however, the CIs were mostly overlapping, 
suggesting consistency with the intention-to-treat wild- 
type primary population. In contrast to progression-free 
survival, no one PD-L1 subgroup drove the overall survival 
benefit, as HRs were similar across all diagnostic 
subgroups, including the subgroup with PD-L1-low 
expression. We hypothesise that the similar HRs resulted 
from the high number of patients in the chemotherapy 
group who crossed over to receive anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 
therapy following progression (almost 60% of patients). 
Progression-free survival was analysed before patients 
received additional anticancer therapies in the second 
line (or beyond) setting, whereas overall survival was 
assessed at the point of death or censoring and, therefore, 
might have been confounded or affected by the additional 
anticancer therapy received by patients up to that point. 
Patients with higher PD-L1 expression would be expected 
to respond more avidly to second-line (or beyond) 
immunotherapy, which might explain the similar HRs 
across PD-L1 subgroups. These findings are consistent 
with those of other first-line anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 
chemotherapy combination studies in PD-L1-unselected 
patients—eg, KEYNOTE-189,19 KEYNOTE-407,20 and 
IMpower150.21 
Overall survival and progression-free survival benefits 
were observed in the majority of demographic subgroups, 
with the exception of patients with liver metastases and 
those with EGFR or ALK genomic alterations who had 
similar outcomes in both treatment groups; patients with 
liver metastasis at enrolment did not show improved 
overall survival when treated with atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. Although 
patient numbers for both subgroups (EGFR or ALK 
genomic alterations or liver metastasis at enrolment) 
were small in IMpower130, outcomes in patients with 
EGFR or ALK genomic alterations were consistent with 
previous studies in patients with non-small-cell lung 
cancer and EGFR-positive disease treated with anti-PD-1 
or anti-PD-L1 therapy.9,22,23 The only PD-1 or PD-L1 plus 
chemotherapy combination 
that has demonstrated 
benefit in patients with EGFR or ALK genomic alterations 
was in IMpower150 (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab and 
carboplatin and paclitaxel vs bevacizumab plus carboplatin 
and paclitaxel in chemotherapy-naive patients with 



metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer);1,24 
addition of bevacizumab to atezolizumab might confer 
activity to PD-L1 inhibition in this patient population.1,25 
As such, atezolizumab plus bevacizumab plus carboplatin 
and paclitaxel was recently approved by the US Food and 
Drug Administration in this indication, and is included 
in the European Society for Medical Oncology and 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice 
guidelines.1,2 Outcomes were also improved for patients 
with 
in 
IMpower130, in which again, the addition of bevacizumab 
to the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy combination 
might be important.25 


With respect to safety, chemotherapy exposure was 
similar in both treatment groups, suggesting that any 
treatment advantage for the atezolizumab plus chemo- 
therapy group was not driven by suboptimal chemotherapy 
exposure in the chemotherapy group and that the 
administration of atezolizumab did not compromise 
the delivery of chemotherapy in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group. The safety profile of atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy was consistent with the known 
adverse events related to single-agent therapy, with 
myelosuppression-related events reported most frequently 
in both groups. No new safety signals were observed. 
There was no imbalance between treatment groups 
with respect to the proportion of patients with fatal 
adverse events (5% in the atezolizumab plus chemo- 
therapy group vs 6% in the chemotherapy group). More 
patients died due to any component of study treatment 
in the atezolizumab plus chemotherapy group (2%) 
compared with the chemotherapy group (<1%), but 
further clinical investigation of these cases identified that 
four of the eight patients in the atezolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group had pre-existing cardiovascular 
conditions, which confounded these results. 
Nab-paclitaxel was paired with carboplatin to form the 
chemotherapy backbone treatment because the require- 
ment for corticosteroid premedication was expected to be 
reduced. Corticosteroids were thought to attenuate the 
potentially beneficial effects of immuno therapy at the 
time that the protocol was written, making carboplatin 
plus nab-paclitaxel a rational partner for investigation in 
combination with atezolizumab in this setting. As 
previously stated, almost 80% of patients in each group 
received corticosteroids, including anti-emetic prophylaxis 
for the carboplatin component. The observed use of 
cortico steroids in IMpower130 was higher than expected, 
and it is not possible to determine the effect of 
corticosteroid use, if any, on the outcome of the study. 
However, the significant and clinically meaningful efficacy 
outcomes observed in this study suggest that the omission 
of corticosteroids is not required when the atezolizumab 
plus chemotherapy (specifically, carboplatin plus nab- 
paclitaxel) regimen is administered to patients in the 
first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small-cell lung 
cancer. 
It should be noted that both the European (European 
Society for Medical Oncology) and American (National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines include the 
combination of nab-paclitaxel and platinum as an option 
for first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small-cell 
lung cancer, based on category 1 evidence.1,2 The 
IMpower130 study results add to the growing body of data 
in favour of the use of first-line anti-PDL-1 or anti-PD-1 
therapy in non-small-cell lung cancer. Anti-PD-1 mono- 
therapy is becoming established as a standard of care 
for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. However, the 
majority of patients have PD-L1-negative or PD-L1- 
unknown disease, and for these patients, conventional 
cytotoxic chemotherapy is still required as a partner to 
immunotherapy.19,24 Oncologists will tailor the choice of 
platinum and partner chemotherapy on the basis of 
patient disease characteristics, the known toxicity profile 
of the chemo therapy combination, and patient comor- 
bidities, along with the emergent data for checkpoint 
lung cancer 
inhibitors as first-line non-small-cell 
treatment. The results from IMpower130 suggest that 
atezolizumab plus chemo therapy is an additional first- 
line treatment option to be considered when formulating 
treatment plans for patients with advanced non- 
squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. 
In summary, IMpower130 shows that the addition of 
atezolizumab to carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel demon- 
strated a significant and clinically meaningful improve- 
ment in overall survival and a significant improvement 
in progression-free survival, with an acceptable safety 
profile, in chemo therapy-naive patients with stage IV 
non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFRwt 
and ALKwt tumours, providing another treatment option 
for patients.
