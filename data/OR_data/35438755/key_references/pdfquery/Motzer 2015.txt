renal cell carcinoma. This randomized, open-label, phase 3 study compared nivolumab with 
everolimus in renal cell carcinoma after prior treatment. 
METHODS—Eight hundred twenty-one patients with advanced clear-cell renal cell carcinoma 
previously treated with one or two antiangiogenic therapies were randomized (1:1) to receive 
nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks or everolimus 10-mg tablet orally once daily. 
Primary end point was overall survival. Secondary end points included objective response rate and 
safety. 
RESULTS—Median (95% confidence interval [CI]) overall survival was 25.0 months (21.8 to not 
estimable) with nivolumab and 19.6 months (17.6 to 23.1) with everolimus. The hazard ratio for 
risk of death with nivolumab versus everolimus was 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.0018), 
meeting the predefined criterion for superiority (P≤0.0148). Objective response rate was greater 
with nivolumab (25%) than everolimus (5%; odds ratio 5.98; 95% CI, 3.68 to 9.72; P<0.001). 
Median (95% CI) progression-free survival was 4.6 months (3.7 to 5.4) with nivolumab and 4.4 
months (3.7 to 5.5) with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; P=0.11). Grade 3 or 
4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19% (nivolumab) and 37% (everolimus) of patients; 
most common was fatigue (3%) with nivolumab and anemia (8%) with everolimus. 
CONCLUSIONS—Overall survival was longer and fewer grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred 
for nivolumab versus everolimus in treatment-experienced patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma. 


Each year there are an estimated 338,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma worldwide,1 and 
approximately 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at diagnosis.2 A number of 
targeted therapies have been approved for the treatment of advanced or metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma. These agents include vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitors and 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors.3,4 Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor 
recommended for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure with sorafenib 
or sunitinib.3–6 Although everolimus and other agents have changed the therapeutic 
landscape for this disease, these treatments are associated with limited overall survival 
following resistance to therapy. 
Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 programmed death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor 
antibody that selectively blocks the interaction between PD-1, expressed on activated T 
cells, and PD-1 ligands 1 and 2 (PD-L1/L2), expressed on immune cells and tumor cells. 
Interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1/L2 normally results in inhibition of the cellular 
immune response.7–9 Prior reports have demonstrated that PD-L1 is associated with poor 
prognosis in renal cell carcinoma, presumably attributed to its immunosuppressive 
function.10–12. It has been postulated that PD-L1 expression would be associated with 
improved overall survival to nivolumab as disruption of PD-1:PD-L1 signaling mediated by 
nivolumab leads to restored antitumor immunity.13,14 


 


In a phase 2 dose-ranging trial in previously treated patients with metastatic renal cell 
carcinoma, nivolumab demonstrated objective responses of 20% to 22% and overall survival 
ranging from 18.2 to 25.5 months.15 Here, we report results from a phase 3 study comparing 
nivolumab with everolimus in patients with previously treated advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01668784). 


Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older, had histological confirmation of advanced or 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma with a clear-cell component, measurable disease according to 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1),16 and previous treatment 
with one or two antiangiogenic therapies. Patients must have had three or fewer total prior 
systemic therapies, including cytokines and cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs, and had 
progression on or after the last therapy received and within 6 months before study 
enrollment. All had a Karnofsky performance status of ≥70%.17 Key exclusion criteria 
included central nervous system metastases, previous treatment with an mTOR inhibitor, or 
a condition requiring glucocorticoids (>10 mg daily prednisone equivalent). 

This was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study of nivolumab compared with everolimus. 
Stratified randomization (1:1 ratio) with block size of 4 was implemented. Stratification 
factors were region (US/Canada or Western Europe or rest of world), Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic risk group (favorable, intermediate, or poor 
risk based on the presence of 0, 1 or 2, or 3 prognostic factors, respectively [anemia, 
hypercalcemia, poor performance status]),18 and number of prior antiangiogenic therapy 
regimens (one or two) for advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
Nivolumab and everolimus were provided by the Sponsor, except in cases when everolimus 
was procured as a local commercial product in certain countries. Nivolumab was 
administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg as a 60-minute intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. 
Everolimus was administered as a daily oral dose of 10 mg. Dose modifications were not 
permitted for nivolumab but were permitted for everolimus. 
This study was approved by the institutional review board/independent ethics committee for 
each center and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines defined by 
the International Conference on Harmonisation. All patients provided written informed 
consent to participate based on the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. A data 
monitoring committee reviewed efficacy and safety during the study. 
The authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of analyses reported and for the 
fidelity of the study to the protocol. Development of the manuscript first draft was led by the 
lead author. All authors contributed to drafting the manuscript and provided final approval to 
submit for publication. Medical writing support, funded by the sponsor, was provided by 
PPSI. The study protocol is available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org. 


 



The primary end point was overall survival, defined as time from randomization to date of 
death. Secondary end points included objective response rate, progression-free survival, 
association of overall survival with PD-L1 tumor expression, and incidence of adverse 
events. Disease assessments were performed using computed tomography or magnetic 
resonance imaging at baseline, every 8 weeks for the first year, then every 12 weeks until 
disease progression or treatment discontinuation. Imaging data were evaluated by the 
investigator to assess tumor response (per RECIST v1.1). Patients were allowed to continue 
study therapy after initial progression if investigator-assessed clinical benefit was noted and 
the patient tolerated study drug. Safety assessments were conducted at each clinic visit. 
After treatment discontinuation, patients were followed every 3 months for survival and 
subsequent anticancer therapy. 
Objective response rate (investigator-assessed) was defined as the number of patients with 
complete response or partial response divided by the number of randomized patients. Best 
overall response was defined as the best response (investigator-assessed) from randomization 
to objectively documented progression or subsequent therapy, whichever occurred first. 
Progression-free survival was defined as the time from randomization to first documented 
RECIST tumor progression/death from any cause. Tumor PD-L1 membrane expression 
(≥1% vs <1% and ≥5% vs <5%) was assessed by a central laboratory in sections with ≥100 
evaluable tumor cells and stained with the Dako PD-L1 immunohistochemistry assay.19 
Adverse events were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.20 Quality of life was assessed using the functional 
assessment of cancer therapy - kidney symptom index - disease-related symptoms (FKSI- 
DRS) scoring algorithm.21 The FKSI-DRS questionnaire comprises nine symptom-specific 
questions that address lack of energy, pain, weight loss, bone pain, fatigue, dyspnea, cough, 
fevers, and hematuria. A summary score ranging from 0 to 36 was produced, with 36 being 
the best possible score (no symptoms) and 0 being the worst possible score (all the worst 
symptoms).21 See Supplementary Appendix for additional details. 

This planned interim analysis was conducted after 398 of 569 deaths (70%) required for the 
final analysis had occurred; the stopping boundary was derived based on the number of 
deaths using an O’Brien–Fleming α spending function that provides 90% power to detect a 
hazard ratio of 0.76 with an overall type 1 error of 0.05 (two-sided).22 Interim overall 
survival was projected at a 0.0148 nominal significance level at which the study could be 
stopped at the recommendation of the data monitoring committee and declared positive for 
efficacy. Interim analysis would then be considered the final analysis. In July 2015, the study 
was stopped early because an assessment conducted by the independent data monitoring 
committee concluded that the study met its endpoint. 
All randomized patients were included for efficacy analyses; patients who received one or 
more doses of study drug were included in safety analyses. Overall survival, progression- 
free survival, and duration of response were estimated using Kaplan–Meier methodology.16 


 





Median and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were provided using Brookmeyer 
and Crowley methodology23; 95% CIs were constructed using log-log transformation. A 
stratified log-rank test was performed to compare overall survival and progression-free 
survival between nivolumab and everolimus. A stratified hazard ratio and CI between 
nivolumab and everolimus was obtained by fitting a stratified Cox model with the group 
variable as single covariate. The difference in response rates between nivolumab and 
everolimus along with the two-sided 95% CI were estimated using the Cochran–Mantel– 
Haenszel method of weighting, adjusting for the stratification factors.24 Survival was 
compared between nivolumab and everolimus using the interim analysis monitoring feature 
of East software based on the Lan–DeMets error spending function approach using an 
O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundary to reject the null hypothesis (no treatment difference), 
controlling for a two-sided overall α of 5.0%.22 If superiority of the primary end point was 
demonstrated, a hierarchical statistical testing procedure was followed for objective response 
rate (estimated along with the exact 95% CI using the Clopper–Pearson method25) and 
progression-free survival at an α of 5.0%. For quality-of-life assessments, descriptive 
statistics were used to assess completion rates and changes in quality of life. 
Between October 2012 and March 2014, 821 patients were randomized at 146 sites in 24 
countries in North America, Europe, Australia, South America, and Asia; 803/821 
randomized patients were treated; 406 and 397 patients in the nivolumab and everolimus 
arms, respectively. At data cut-off (June 2015), 67/406 patients (17%) in the nivolumab arm 
and 28/397 patients (7%) in the everolimus arm remained on treatment (Figure S1 in 
Supplementary Appendix). Minimum follow-up was 15 months. The primary reason for 
discontinuation was disease progression (285/406 [70%] with nivolumab; 273/397 [69%] 
with everolimus; Figure S1 in Supplementary Appendix). Demographic and clinical 
characteristics were balanced between treatment arms; the majority of patients (72%) 
received one prior antiangiogenic therapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (Table 1). 
Overall Survival—Median overall survival was 25.0 months (95% CI, 21.8 to not 
estimable) with nivolumab and 19.6 months (95% CI, 17.6 to 23.1) with everolimus (Figure 
1). Deaths occurred in 181/406 patients (45%) treated with nivolumab and in 213/397 
patients (54%) treated with everolimus. The hazard ratio for risk of death (any cause) with 
nivolumab versus everolimus was 0.73 (98.5% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P=0.0018), meeting the 
predefined criterion for superiority. Overall survival benefit with nivolumab was observed 
across predefined subgroups including region, MSKCC prognostic score, and number of 
prior antiangiogenic therapies (Figure 2A). The heterogeneity of treatment effect within each 
subgroup shown in Figure 2a was tested through an interaction test in a Cox proportional 
hazards model with treatment, subgroup, and treatment by subgroup interaction as 
covariates. None of the interaction terms was statistically significant at the 5% level. 


 


Tumor Response and Progression-Free Survival—Objective response rate was 
higher with nivolumab than with everolimus (25% vs. 5%; Table S1; odds ratio 5.98; 95% 
CI, 3.68 to 9.72; P<0.001). Partial responses were observed in 99 patients (24%) treated with 
nivolumab and 20 patients (5%) treated with everolimus. Complete responses were observed 
in four patients treated with nivolumab (1%) and two patients treated with everolimus 
(<1%). The median time to response was 3.5 months (range 1.4 to 24.8; n=103) with 
nivolumab and 3.7 months (range 1.5 to 11.2; n=22) with everolimus; median (range) 
duration of response was 12.0 months (0 to 27.6+) and 12.0 months (0 to 22.2+), 
respectively. In patients with a response, 45/103 (44%) and 8/22 (36%) had an ongoing 
response; 32/103 (31%) and 6/22 (27%) patients with a response had an ongoing response 
≥12 months with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively (Figure S2 in Supplementary 
Appendix). 
Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.4) with nivolumab and 
4.4 months (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.5) with everolimus (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.03; 
P=0.11; Figure 2B). To explore the apparent delayed separation of the curves, we performed 
an ad hoc sensitivity analysis of progression-free survival in patients who had not 
progressed/died at 6 months (n=145 [35%], nivolumab; n=129 [31%], everolimus). The 
analysis of this subset of patients yielded a median (95% CI) progression-free survival of 
15.6 months (11.8 to 19.6) with nivolumab and 11.7 months (10.9 to 14.7) with everolimus 
(hazard ratio, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88). 
PD-L1 Expression—Of the 821 patients who were randomized, 756 (92%) had 
quantifiable tumor PD-L1 expression in pretreatment samples; 370/410 (90%) treated with 
nivolumab and 386/411 (94%) treated with everolimus (Table 1). In total, 181/756 patients 
(24%) with quantifiable PD-L1 expression had ≥1% PD-L1 expression and 575/756 patients 
(76%) had <1% PD-L1 expression (Table 1). In patients with ≥1% PD-L1 expression, 
median (95% CI) overall survival was 21.8 months (16.5 to 28.1) with nivolumab and 18.8 
months (11.9 to 19.9) with everolimus (hazard ratio 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.16; Figure 3A). 
In patients with <1%, PD-L1 expression, median (95% CI) overall survival was 27.4 months 
(21.4 to not estimable) with nivolumab and 21.2 months (17.7 to 26.2) with everolimus 
(hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.97; Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in 
patients with ≥5% PD-L1 expression versus patients with <5% PD-L1 expression, although 
interpretation is limited by small numbers of patients with ≥5% expression (Figure S3 in 
Supplementary Appendix). 

The median (range) duration of treatment was 5.5 months (<0.1 to 29.6) with nivolumab and 
3.7 months (0.2 to 25.7) with everolimus. In total, 207/406 patients (51%) had dose delays 
with nivolumab and 262/397 patients (66%) had dose delays (including interruptions) with 
everolimus. Dose reductions were not allowed with nivolumab and 102/397 patients (26%) 
had at least one dose reduction with everolimus. 
Any-grade treatment-related adverse events occurred in 319/406 (79%) and 349/397 (88%) 
of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively (Table 2). The most common 


 


treatment-related adverse events were fatigue (134/406; 33%), nausea (57/406; 14%), and 
pruritus (57/406; 14%) with nivolumab and fatigue (134/397; 34%), stomatitis (117/397; 
30%), and anemia (94/397; 24%) with everolimus. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse 
events occurred in 76/406 and 145/397 patients (19% and 37%) treated with nivolumab and 
everolimus, respectively; the most common was fatigue (10/406; 3%) with nivolumab and 
anemia (31/397; 8%) with everolimus. 
Treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred in 31/406 (8%) and 
52/397 (13%) of patients treated with nivolumab and everolimus, respectively. No deaths 
from study drug toxicity were reported with nivolumab and two deaths were reported with 
everolimus (septic shock; acute bowel ischemia). Treatment beyond initial RECIST v1.1- 
defined progression with investigator-assessed clinical benefit occurred in 44% (n=179) of 
patients treated with nivolumab and 45% (n=183) of patients treated with everolimus. 

The FKSI-DRS questionnaire completion rate was ≥80% throughout the study. Quality-of- 
life scores were similar in both arms at baseline (Table S2 in Supplementary Appendix). 
From the first assessment after baseline (week 4) through week 104, median quality-of-life 
scores were numerically higher than baseline in 24/26 assessments (92%) with nivolumab 
and 2/26 assessments (8%) with everolimus (Table S2 in Supplementary Appendix). 

Two hundred twenty-seven (55%) of 410 patients treated with nivolumab and 260/411 
patients (63%) treated with everolimus received subsequent systemic therapy. The most 
common subsequent therapies following nivolumab included everolimus (105/410; 26%), 
axitinib (99/410; 24%), and pazopanib (37/410; 9%); the most common following 
everolimus were axitinib (150/411; 37%), pazopanib (64/411; 16%), and sorafenib (38/411; 
9%). Anti-PD-1 therapy was given as subsequent therapy to six patients in the everolimus 
arm. 

This phase 3 randomized study demonstrated that patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma experienced longer survival with nivolumab treatment than with everolimus 
treatment after prior antiangiogenic treatment. The separation of the overall survival curves 
occurred early in the study and median overall survival was 5.4 months longer with 
nivolumab (25.0 months) compared with everolimus (19.6 months), a difference that crossed 
the prespecified boundary for statistical significance at the time of the interim analysis. 
This study also demonstrated a higher number of objective responses with nivolumab versus 
everolimus, many of which were durable. Median progression-free survival was similar 
between treatments and consistent with that reported previously in an uncontrolled study in 
patients previously treated with antiangiogenic therapies.15 Moreover, comparison of 
progression-free survival between nivolumab and everolimus arms was not a surrogate for 
overall survival in this study. Late separation of the curves suggested a potential delayed 
benefit in progression-free survival with nivolumab. This delayed progression-free survival 


 


benefit was subsequently quantified using a sensitivity analysis in patients who had not 
progressed or died at 6 months; median progression-free survival was longer with nivolumab 
versus everolimus in this subset of patients. These patients likely contributed to the overall 
survival benefit observed with nivolumab in this study. 
We observed consistent prolonged survival with nivolumab versus everolimus irrespective of 
MSKCC prognostic score, number of prior antiangiogenic therapies, and region. Benefit was 
observed with nivolumab irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Nivolumab has been reported to 
be associated with pharmacodynamic changes in blood and tumor markers consistent with 
PD-1 inhibition.12 Our data corroborate previous reports indicating that higher levels of PD- 
L1 expression are associated with poorer survival in renal cell carcinoma,10,11 but do not 
support PD-L1 as a marker of treatment benefit in renal cell carcinoma. The relationship 
between PD-L1 expression and nivolumab outcomes appears to depend on tumor type and 
histology and may also depend on treatment setting. An association between PD-L1 
expression and improved outcomes with nivolumab treatment has been observed for 
metastatic melanoma and only some types of lung cancer26,27 .28 
Nivolumab had a safety profile consistent with findings in other studies.13–15 Grade 3 or 4 
treatment-related adverse events were less frequent with nivolumab than with everolimus 
and treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation were experienced by fewer 
patients treated with nivolumab. Differences in the frequency of specific adverse events 
between treatments were reflective of drug class. Quality-of-life, as assessed by the FKSI- 
DRS, improved during nivolumab treatment but remained stable with everolimus. Additional 
analyses will further characterize the quality-of-life observed with nivolumab compared with 
everolimus treatment in this study. 
There has been considerable progress in the treatment of this disease since 2005, with five 
VEGF pathway inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, bevacizumab, pazopanib, and axitinib) and 
two mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus) showing benefit in pivotal phase 3 trials, 
leading to regulatory approval. Prior to this era, infrequent but occasionally long-standing 
responses were observed with cytokines, including high doses of interleukin-2.29 With one 
exception,30 the benefit for approved targeted drugs has been established by phase 3 studies 
showing improvement in progression-free survival, but not overall survival compared with 
standard treatment, which included interferon-α, placebo, or an approved antiangiogenic 
drug.3 In patients previously treated with sunitinib in the phase 3 AXIS trial, no benefit in 
overall survival was detected (median overall survival: 15.2 months with axitinib vs. 16.5 
months with sorafenib).31 The median overall survival of 25.0 months and the survival 
improvement for the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab compared with everolimus 
provides evidence of benefit in treatment-experienced patients with advanced renal cell 
carcinoma.
