Background: There currently are no internationally recognised treatment guidelines for patients with advanced gastric cancer/ 
gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC) in whom two prior lines of therapy have failed. The randomised, phase III 
JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial compared avelumab versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy as third-line therapy in patients with 
advanced GC/GEJC. 
Patients and methods: Patients with unresectable, recurrent, 
at 147 sites globally. All patients were randomised to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks 
or physician’s choice of chemotherapy (paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or irinotecan 150 mg/m2 on days 1 and 15, 
each of a 4-week treatment cycle); patients ineligible for chemotherapy received best supportive care. The primary end point 
was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and 
safety. 

Results: A total of 371 patients were randomised. The trial did not meet its primary end point of improving OS {median, 4.6 
versus 5.0 months; hazard ratio (HR)¼1.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9–1.4]; P ¼ 0.81} or the secondary end points of PFS 
[median, 1.4 versus 2.7 months; HR¼1.73 (95% CI 1.4–2.2); P > 0.99] or ORR (2.2% versus 4.3%) in the avelumab versus 
chemotherapy arms, respectively. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 90 patients (48.9%) and 
131 patients (74.0%) in the avelumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. Grade (cid:2)3 TRAEs occurred in 17 patients (9.2%) in 
the avelumab arm and in 56 patients (31.6%) in the chemotherapy arm.

Phase III, randomised trial of avelumab versus 
physician’s choice of chemotherapy as third-line 
treatment of patients with advanced gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction cancer: primary analysis 
of JAVELIN Gastric 300 


Conclusions: Treatment of patients with GC/GEJC with single-agent avelumab in the third-line setting did not result in an 
improvement in OS or PFS compared with chemotherapy. Avelumab showed a more manageable safety profile than 
chemotherapy. 


Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic gastric cancer/gastro- 
oesophageal junction cancer (GC/GEJC) have poor prognosis, 
with median overall survival (OS) of (cid:3)1 year; patients with 
previously treated metastatic GC/GEJC have even worse progno- 
sis [1–4]. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for 
advanced GC/GEJC and can prolong survival and improve qual- 
ity of life compared with best supportive care (BSC); however, 
most chemotherapy regimens fail to provide substantial survival 
beneﬁts [3, 4]. 
For patients with advanced GC/GEJC, ﬁrst-line treatment with 
platinum and ﬂuoropyrimidine is standard, with trastuzumab 
added for patients with HER2þ tumours [5–7]. Preferred 
second-line treatments include taxanes, irinotecan, or ramuciru- 
mab as monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel [5, 6]. 
Although phase III data are lacking, third-line chemotherapy is 
widely utilised in patients in whom previous lines have failed, es- 
pecially in Asia [8]. In the TAGS study, triﬂuridine/tipiracil 
improved OS [5.7 versus 3.6 months; HR ¼0.69 (95% CI 0.56– 
0.85); P ¼ 0.0003] compared with placebo as third-line or later 
therapy for advanced GC [9]. Currently, there are no standard, 
internationally recognised guidelines for third-line therapy for 
patients with advanced GC/GEJC, underscoring the need for ef- 
fective therapies with acceptable safety proﬁles [5, 6, 8, 10]. 
GC/GEJC is associated with immune system evasion and over- 
expression of immune checkpoint proteins, providing the ration- 
ale for immunotherapy with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy [11–14]. 
Elevated expression of PD-L1 has been reported in up to 65% 
of GC/GEJC and is associated with speciﬁc subtypes of 
gastric adenocarcinoma and tumours with high mutational bur- 
den [11–14]. However, there is currently no consensus on the 
role of PD-L1 expression as a prognostic biomarker in advanced 
GC [15]. 
Initial trial results have demonstrated the clinical activity of 
immunotherapy in the third-line setting or beyond in patients 
with advanced GC/GEJC in single-arm studies or randomised tri- 
als using placebo as the comparator. Pembrolizumab was granted 
accelerated approval in the USA for patients with PD-L1þ GC on 
the basis of a cohort of a large, non-randomised, phase II study 
showing tumour responses and manageable safety in patients 
whose disease had progressed after (cid:2)2 prior lines of chemother- 
apy [16]. In a phase III trial carried out in Asian patients, nivolu- 
mab administered as third or later line of treatment improved OS 
versus placebo, resulting in approval in Japan, Taiwan, and South 
Korea for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent 
GC progressing after chemotherapy [2]. 
Avelumab is a human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 monoclonal antibody 
that is approved for advanced urothelial carcinoma and metastat- 
ic Merkel cell carcinoma and has demonstrated efﬁcacy in various 
solid tumours, including GC/GEJC [17, 18]. In a cohort of the 
phase I JAVELIN Solid Tumor trial, avelumab administered as 
ﬁrst-line maintenance or second-line treatment of patients with 
advanced GC/GEJC showed durable antitumour activity and an 
acceptable safety proﬁle [19]. Avelumab has also shown encour- 
aging results in a phase I cohort of Japanese patients with 
advanced GC/GEJC that progressed after chemotherapy in the 
JAVELIN Solid Tumor JPN trial [20]. 
Here, we report the results from a randomised, phase III trial 
of avelumab versus physician’s choice of chemotherapy as third- 
line treatment in patients with advanced GC/GEJC. 

JAVELIN Gastric 300 (NCT02625623) is a multicentre, international, 
randomised, open-label, phase III trial assessing avelumab versus physi- 
cian’s choice of chemotherapy as a third-line treatment of patients with 
advanced GC/GEJC. Eligible patients were required to be aged (cid:2)18 years; 
have histologically conﬁrmed recurrent, unresectable, locally advanced, 
or metastatic GC/GEJC (with either measurable or non-measurable dis- 
ease) for which they received two prior lines of systemic treatment; and 
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. 
Exclusion criteria included prior treatment with T-cell coregulatory pro- 
tein inhibitors, concurrent anticancer treatment, and concurrent treat- 
ment with immunosuppressive agents (see supplementary methods, 
available at Annals of Oncology online). The trial was conducted in ac- 
cordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other regulations. The 
protocol was approved by the institutional review board or independent 
ethics committee of each centre; all patients provided written informed 
consent before participation. 

All patients were randomised 1 : 1 to receive BSC and either avelumab 
10 mg/kg by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks or physician’s choice of 
chemotherapy. Premedication with diphenhydramine and acetamino- 
phen was required 30–60 min before avelumab infusion. Permitted 
options in the chemotherapy arm included paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on days 
1, 8, and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle or irinotecan 150 mg/m2 on days 
1 and 15 of a 4-week treatment cycle. Patients randomised to the chemo- 
therapy arm and deemed ineligible for chemotherapy were allowed to 
receive BSC without chemotherapy (irrespective, the non-avelumab- 
containing treatment arm will be referred to as the ‘chemotherapy’ arm 
hereafter). All patients were treated until progression, death, intolerable 
toxicity, or any other protocol-deﬁned treatment discontinuation criter- 
ion was met. 

The primary objective was to demonstrate superiority of avelumab versus 
chemotherapy in terms of OS. Key secondary objectives included com- 
paring progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) 





per independent review committee (IRC) assessment, as well as safety/ 
tolerability. Exploratory objectives included assessing duration of and 
time to response and evaluating tumour shrinkage of target lesions from 
baseline, disease control rate (DCR), and tumour cell PD-L1 expression 
levels in relation to response parameters (DCR, ORR, PFS, and OS). 

On-treatment decisions were made at the discretion of the investigator 
(including discontinuation from study treatment), whereas assessments 
reported here are based on a blinded IRC. PFS and objective response 
were assessed per RECIST v1.1 by an IRC [21]. Adverse events (AEs) were 
evaluated using the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 (see supplementary methods, 
available at Annals of Oncology online). 

The sample size for this trial was selected to provide 90% power to dem- 
onstrate improvement of 2 months of median OS time from 4 to 
6 months [the primary end point; equivalent to a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.67 at the one-sided 2.5% overall signiﬁcance level]. The primary ana- 
lysis of comparing OS between treatment groups used a stratiﬁed, one- 
sided log-rank test on the intention-to-treat population and was planned 
for when 256 OS events had occurred and follow-up was (cid:2)6 months. The 
stratiﬁcation factor of region (Asia versus non-Asia) was used for the 
stratiﬁed statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary end points. 
Time-to-event end points were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier 
method, and conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for the medians were calculated 
using the Brookmeyer–Crowley method. 

Between 28 December 2015 and 13 March 2017, 459 patients 
were screened for participation, and 371 were enrolled (Figure 1). 
Of the 371 enrolled patients, 185 and 186 patients were rando- 
mised to the avelumab and chemotherapy arms, respectively. In 
the chemotherapy arm, 120 (64.5%) patients received irinotecan, 
54 (29.0%) paclitaxel, and 3 patients (1.6%) received BSC only. 
Patient demographics and disease characteristics were generally 
balanced between arms (Table 1). Notably, 93 patients (25.1%) 
were enrolled in Asian countries. 
At data cut-off (14 September 2017), median duration of treat- 
ment in the avelumab arm was 8.0 weeks (range 2–66) and 
patients received a median of 3 doses (range 1–31), while the 
chemotherapy arm had median treatment duration of 9.0 weeks 
(range 4–58) and patients received a median of 5 doses (range 1– 
39). Median duration of follow-up was 10.6 months in both the 
avelumab (range 0.1–17.8) and chemotherapy (range 0.0–17.6) 
arms. Twenty patients (5.4%) were still receiving study treatment 
[10 (5.4%) in each arm] at data cut-off. Disease progression was 
the most common reason for discontinuation in both the avelu- 
mab [n ¼ 139 (75.1%)] and chemotherapy [n ¼ 134 (72.0%)] 
arms. Post-treatment anticancer drug therapy was received by 58 
patients (31.3%) and 66 patients (35.4%) in the avelumab and 
chemotherapy arms, respectively; the use of post-progression 
chemotherapy was balanced between arms (supplementary Table 
S1, available at Annals of Oncology online). Seventeen patients 
(9.4%) had detectable antidrug antibodies in the avelumab arm. 


The intention-to-treat population (all patients randomised to 
study treatment) comprised all 371 randomised patients. Median 
OS, the primary end point, was 4.6 months (95% CI 3.6–5.7) in 
the avelumab arm compared with 5.0 months (95% CI 4.5–6.3) 
in the chemotherapy arm [HR ¼1.1 (95% CI 0.9–1.4); P ¼ 0.81] 
(Figure 2). There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences be- 
tween the irinotecan and paclitaxel chemotherapy subgroups 
(supplementary Figure S1, available at Annals of Oncology on- 
line). When assessing solely patients with disease control, median 
OS favoured avelumab [12.5 months (95% CI 7.8–17.8) versus 
8.0 months (95% CI 7.0–11.0)]. 
Median PFS was 1.4 months (95% CI 1.4–1.5) in the avelumab 
arm and 2.7 months (95% CI 1.8–2.8) in the chemotherapy arm 
[HR ¼1.73 (95% CI 1.4–2.2); P > 0.99]. 
Subgroup analyses of OS according to baseline demographics 
and disease characteristics, including PD-L1 expression, dis- 
played no signiﬁcant differences favouring either treatment arm, 
while PFS subgroup analyses consistently favoured the chemo- 
therapy arm (supplementary Figures S2 and S3, available at 
Annals of Oncology online). 
The conﬁrmed ORR was 2.2% (n ¼ 4, 95% CI 0.6–5.4) and 
4.3% (n ¼ 8, 95% CI 1.9–8.3) in the avelumab and chemotherapy 
arms, respectively (Table 2). At data cut-off, eight patients had 
ongoing responses in the avelumab (n ¼ 3) and chemotherapy 
(n ¼ 5) arms. ORRs by patient subgroup are shown in supple- 
mentary Table S2, available at Annals of Oncology online. Median 
time to response was 12.2 weeks (range 5.7–17.6) in the avelumab 
arm and 11.6 weeks (range 4.3–23.6) in the chemotherapy arm 
(supplementary Figure S4, available at Annals of Oncology on- 
line). Median duration of response was not determined (range 
1.4–5.5) and 5.5 months (range 1.5–7.0) in the avelumab and 
chemotherapy arms, respectively. The ORR was similar in an ex- 
ploratory post hoc analysis of only randomised patients with 
measurable disease at baseline (2.0% versus 4.6% in the avelumab 
and chemotherapy arms, respectively). 

The safety analysis set (all patients who were administered any 
dose of study treatment or BSC only) comprised 184 patients 
treated with avelumab and 177 patients treated with chemother- 
apy. Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 90 
patients (48.9%) in the avelumab arm and 131 patients (74.0%) 
in the chemotherapy arm (Table 3). Grade (cid:2)3 TRAEs occurred 
in 17 patients (9.2%) in the avelumab arm and 56 patients 
(31.6%) in the chemotherapy arm. 
TRAEs led to discontinuation in seven patients (3.8%) in the 
avelumab arm and nine patients (5.1%) in the chemotherapy 
arm. Death related to treatment occurred in one patient (0.6%; 
sudden death) in the chemotherapy arm; 
there were no 
treatment-related deaths in the avelumab arm. Following com- 
prehensive medical review, 12 patients (6.5%) were found to 
have an immune-related AE with avelumab, which was grade (cid:2)3 
in 4 patients (2.2%; autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune hypo- 
thyroidism, colitis, and elevated AST). Treatment-related infu- 
sion-related reactions, as evaluated according to a composite 
deﬁnition of preferred terms including signs and symptoms,

and chemotherapy arms, respectively. 
treatment of GC/GEJC, did not meet its primary end point of 
improving OS or the secondary end points of PFS and ORR. 
Avelumab showed clinical activity in patients with GC/GEJC pre- 
viously treated with two prior regimens for advanced disease, al- 
though not superior to chemotherapy; moreover, the safety 
proﬁle of avelumab was superior to that of chemotherapy.

which used a placebo instead of an active comparator in the con-

0.78); P < 0.0001] compared with placebo as third or later line of

setting, chemotherapy is frequently used on the basis of several 
studies that have suggested improved patient outcomes relative 
to BSC or placebo [23]. 
GC/GEJC is biologically heterogeneous, which increases the 
difﬁculty of treatment. However, we did not ﬁnd evidence of clin- 
ical beneﬁt compared with commonly used chemotherapy in any 
of the examined subgroups, including tumour PD-L1 expression 
status. Furthermore, the impact of PD-L1 expression on progno- 
sis in advanced GC/GEJC is not completely clear. Recent ﬁndings 
from a meta-analysis suggested that PD-L1 expression levels are 
associated with OS [24]. Conversely, this study and others have 
not shown a strong link between prognosis and tumour PD-L1 
expression in patients with GC/GEJC [13]. Potential differences 
in patient cohorts, immunohistochemistry methods, and end 
points may account for these ﬁndings. 
Another important ﬁnding from our study is that fewer 
patients had TRAEs with avelumab than with chemotherapy (ei- 
ther any-grade or grade (cid:2)3 TRAEs). These results demonstrate 
that avelumab is better tolerated than chemotherapy in patients 
with heavily pretreated GC/GEJC, supporting the potential of 
avelumab for combination or maintenance therapy, even in later 
strategy for 
stages of disease. Nevertheless,

incorporating checkpoint inhibitors into the continuum of care 
for patients with advanced GC/GEJC is still unknown, and stud- 
ies of alternative anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment strategies in earlier 
lines of therapy are warranted. 
Ongoing randomised, phase III trials for advanced GC/GEJC 
evaluating checkpoint inhibitors in the ﬁrst-line setting include 
CheckMate 649 (NCT02872116), comparing nivolumab plus ipi- 
limumab versus nivolumab plus investigator’s choice of chemo- 
therapy (XELOX or FOLFOX) versus chemotherapy alone. 
ATTRACTION-4 (NCT02746796) is a phase II/III trial evaluat- 
ing nivolumab plus chemotherapy (oxaliplatin plus either S-1 or 
capecitabine) versus chemotherapy alone in Asian patients. 
KEYNOTE-062 (NCT02494583) is comparing pembrolizumab 
as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin/5-FU (or cape- 
citabine) versus cisplatin/5-FU (or capecitabine) alone as treat- 
ment of patients with PD-L1þ tumours. JAVELIN Gastric 100 
(NCT02625610), a randomised, phase III trial is comparing 
single-agent avelumab administered after patients receive at least 
stable disease with 3 months of ﬁrst-line platinum-based chemo- 
therapy as switch-maintenance treatment versus continuation of 
chemotherapy. 
Results from these randomised, controlled trials will contrib- 
ute to the unmet need for therapeutic efﬁcacy and safety data to 
inform standardised guidelines for the management of advanced
